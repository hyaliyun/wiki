The river's name derives from a small gold rush in its basin during the 1860s, and was originally Gold Stream. == Course == Niagara Falls The Goldstream River begins at the outlet of Butchart Lake, the first of three reservoirs along the upper reaches of the Goldstream which are within the Greater Victoria Watershed Area. Shortly after exiting Butchart Lake it flows into Lubbe Lake. Shortly after exiting Lubbe Lake the river enters the final and largest of the three lakes, Goldstream Lake. After exiting Goldstream Lake, the river flows southeast until it turns north and enters Goldstream Provincial Park. Just before entering the park, the river receives its first major tributary, Waugh Creek. About halfway through the park, the river tumbles over Goldstream Falls. After the falls it continues north, receiving its final major tributary, Niagara Creek, just before finally entering the southern end of Finlayson Arm, a long inlet at the south end of the larger Saanich Inlet, while still inside the park. ==Power generation== The powerlines would leave the structure here and begin their 19 km (12 mi) journey to Victoria. At the turn of the century, the Lubbe Hydroelectric Plant was operated near Goldstream and created electricity by running high pressure drinking water through a turbine. A powerline then ran into Victoria and provided electricity to power the streetcars of the day. The plant still exists but is inaccessible to the public. ==Wildlife== Goldstream River and Goldstream Provincial Park host a wide variety of wildlife. In particular, Coho salmon spawn in the river in late October to November. Spawning season attracts a great number of visitors to the park. A large variety of west coast birds can be found by the river, with bald eagles and seagulls commonly seen consuming dead salmon after they have spawned. ==December 2010 prank== On December 29, 2010 fluorescein was dumped in the Goldstream River, likely as a prank. The result was that the waters turned a bright, glowing green. Health officials said the chemical is non-toxic, used primarily to find leaks in septic systems along with various medical applications. Some people may experience allergic reactions. As of January 10, 2011 it was unknown who dumped the chemical. ==See also== * Goldstream Provincial Park * Goldstream, British Columbia * Leechtown, British Columbia * Mount Finlayson * Sooke Flowline ==References== * ==External links== * Official provincial park site * Unofficial park visitors site Category:Rivers of Vancouver Island Category:Greater Victoria ","title":"Goldstream River (Vancouver Island)"},{"id":"19294517","text":"Al Jabalayn (also El Jebelein) is a town in central Sudan lying on the east bank of the River Nile.

They currently play in the NSWRL Sydney Shield competition. The team previously competed in the Western Suburbs 1st Grade competition, Canterbury 1st Grade competition, Jim Beam Cup, Bundaberg Red Cup, the Wests Juniors/Group 6 combined competition, Group 6 CRL Competition and now the Semi Professional New South Wales Sydney Shield Competition. ==History== The East Campbelltown Eagles RLFC was established in 1961 as a junior Rugby League club from the Campbelltown East Primary School. Starting with the colors Red and White which came from the local bus company situated on Broughton Street. The Club had a full Red jersey with white saddles on their shoulders, a big letter E on the heart side of the jersey, white shorts and striped socks. East Campbelltown was originally part of the Group 6 Country Rugby League. The Club's first home ground was Orana Park Leumeah from 1961 until 1968, Orana Park is now the Campbelltown Stadium. Land on 32 Waminda Avenue was donated to the local Rugby League Club which was a small cattle farm. The majority of the houses around the East Campbelltown Area originally were chicken farms that was given to serviceman returning from World War 1 back in 1918. The East Campbelltown Rugby League Club then moved to the new ground on Waminda Avenue, the name Waminda is an Aboriginal word for Comrade, which obviously came from the returned service men living in the area. East Campbelltown was also originally called the Settlement. Protest from the locals in the 60‚Äôs seen a name change to East Campbelltown as they thought the Settlement name was more of a name for a penal colony. The E displayed on the East Campbelltown had opposition clubs calling the E for easy beats. The East Campbelltown President Mr E.W Lardner wanted to put a stop to the Easy Beats Tag and designed an Eagle. He then had the Eagles sown on all the jerseys with the name change to East Campbelltown Eagles in 1969. This also coincided with the move to Waminda Oval from Oranan Park in 1969. The 1970s, East Campbelltown Eagles were a junior club that fielded teams from Under 6's to Under 16's. All players once past the age of 16 would then go and play for the senior club Campbelltown City Kangaroos. Campbelltown City had some successful years in the early 80‚Äôs that contributed from many East Campbelltown Eagles Junior players. By the late 1970s, the East Campbelltown Eagles club came to life being the largest Junior Rugby League Club in the District and winning the Coca-Cola Knockout in 1977 and 1979, but it wasn‚Äôt all smooth sailing for East Campbelltown Eagles in the 70‚Äôs. A break away club named Leumeah Wolves formed on Waminda Oval field number 2. They wore the Blue and White Bulldogs strip, this gave the East Campbelltown Eagles club unwanted competition for local players. Waminda Oval had gone through a few changes, the top field was fenced and a cricket pitch added, it wasn‚Äôt in favour for the Rugby League Club. The original farm house was demolished and made way for the current East Campbelltown Community Hall and the last house on Brisbane Avenue that backed onto Waminda Oval had the club wanting to buy it for a mere $7,000 but opposition from a Local Club wouldn‚Äôt allow the sale to go ahead. By the end of 1979 East Campbelltown Eagles with a team full of 17 year olds asked permission to Group 6 CRL for a special exemption to field an Under 18's team. To Campbelltown City's disproval it was granted for a team coached by Don Young that became East Campbelltown‚Äôs first ever Under 18‚Äôs team in 1980. The team against all odds defeated arch rivals Campbelltown Collegians in the Grand Final at Bradbury Oval in 1980. In 1980 East Campbelltown Eagles fielded 18 teams and won an amazing 8 Premierships, they had also won the Group 6 Junior Club Champions. The end of 1983 seen the end of Group 6 in Campbelltown as Campbelltown was now seen as a small city and no longer part of the Country Rugby League. The competition was separated from what they called the water line, which was the convict built water canal that ran from the cataract dam through Narellan Road to the back of St Andrews Road, sides North-Wests of the water line were required to form the Newtown-Campbelltown Jets Rugby League, financial issues from Newtown Jets seen another Name change to Campbelltown Hornets in 1985 before the Western Suburbs Magpies District Rugby League was formed in 1986. The late 1980s to the early 1990s the club struggled sharing Waminda Oval with Leumeah Wolves which was a blue and white club that broke away from the East Campbelltown Club in 1978. When Leumeah Wolves folded in 1993 and East Campbelltown Eagles formed their senior base with now an Under 18's reserve Grade and 1st Grade they became the heavy weight club they were known for in the 70's, in many Semi final and Final 1st Grade appearances they couldn't crack that illusive Premiership until the 2001 season which was an important year for the Eagles, winning the Minor Premiership, Premiership, Senior Club Champions and Overall Club Champions, and to kick start the club's two decades of dominance at a Senior Level. The demise of the 1st Grade competition locally seen the East Campbelltown Eagles take on the best from the Canterbury District in 2007, The Eagles winning their second 1st Grade Premiership defeating Canterbury's prestigious club St Christopher's 19-12 under the coach Daniel Draper and Richard Barnes. In 2008, the Eagles gained acceptance into the NSWRL Jim Beam Cup. Where they were the first Campbelltown side to compete in such a high level competition. The Eagles re-joined the combined Group 6-Westerns Suburbs District A-grade competition at the start of the 2009 season, where they started to dominate the competition winning the Grand Final in the Under 18's featuring NRL star Tim Lafai. That year they also made the Grand Final in Reserve Grade and 3rd Grade Competition. By the 2011 season the club had grew in strength and became competition favorites going through the regular season with only the one loss but went down in the Grand Final, that year they still had success with the Reserve Grade winning undefeated Captain Coached by club stalwart Daniel Draper, a huge local rivalry had again formed with Campbelltown City and a record the East Campbelltown Eagles boast is that the Campbelltown City Club has never defeated East Campbelltown Eagles in any 1st Grade match. In 2012, The East Campbelltown Eagles went through the competition undefeated winning the Group 6 Grand Final with ease 44-6 and were named winners of the CRL Clayton's Cup and were the first Campbelltown Side to win the prestigious award. They had further success again winning the Reserve Grade competition and by 2013 the club had become a formidable powerhouse that wasn't excepted well with the Group 6 Management as the Club was voted out of the competition. Sam Hoare in action for the Campbelltown Eagles In 2014, the Eagles had gone from rags to riches as they won the NSWRL Sydney Shield competition, going in as huge underdogs against the Mount Pritchard Mounties, the Eagles went on to win the match and the premiership. In 2016, East Campbelltown won the Sydney Shield for a second time defeating Mounties in one of the all time upsets as Mounties went into the Grand Final winning 21 games straight. In 2018, East Campbelltown won the Sydney Shield for a third time defeating the Guildford Owls 32-22 at Leichhardt Oval.https://www.nswrl.com.au/news/2018/09/22/relentless-eagles-claim-grand- final-triumph/ ==Team emblem and homeground== East Campbelltown's logo is that of a red and white eagle inside a ring with the words \\"Campbelltown Eagles R.L.F.C\\" written on it. This logo is similar to that of NSWRL side, Manly Sea Eagles, with the colours changed to suit the club. The colours of the Eagles' jerseys are also red and white like their emblem.

It occupies the southeastern portion of the Tahltan Highland, an upland area of plateau and lower mountain ranges, lying east of the Boundary Ranges and south of the Inklin River, which is the east fork of the Taku River. As a volcanic complex, it consists of many types of volcanoes, including shield volcanoes, calderas, lava domes, stratovolcanoes, and cinder cones. Most of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex is encompassed within a large provincial park called Mount Edziza Provincial Park. Named after Mount Edziza, this park was established in 1972 to preserve the volcanic and cultural treasures unique to the northern British Columbia area. The Mount Edziza volcanic complex is remote, and, without roads, accessible only along trails. The easiest access is from Highway 37 and a spur road from Dease Lake to Telegraph Creek. From Kinaskan Lake, on Highway 37, a poorly maintained trail extends west for into the heart of the complex. From Telegraph Creek another trail extends east for to the north slope of Mount Edziza. ==GeologyOrigins=== The Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province rift The Mount Edziza volcanic complex began forming about 7.5 million years ago and has grown steadily since then. Like other volcanoes in northwestern British Columbia, the Mount Edziza volcanic complex has its origins in continental rifting‚Äîa long divergent plate boundary where the lithosphere is being pulled apart. Here, the continental crust of the North American Plate is being stretched at a rate of about per year. This incipient rifting has formed as a result of the Pacific Plate sliding northward along the Queen Charlotte Fault, on its way to the Aleutian Trench, which extends along the southern coastline of Alaska and the adjacent waters of northeastern Siberia off the coast of Kamchatka Peninsula. As the continental crust stretches, the near-surface rocks fracture along steeply dipping cracks parallel to the rift known as faults. Hot basaltic magma rises along these fractures to create passive lava eruptions, known as effusive eruptions. The rift zone has existed for at least 20 million years, and has created a line of volcanoes called the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, also called the Stikine Volcanic Belt, stretching from the Alaska-Yukon border to near Prince Rupert, British Columbia. Several presently dormant volcanoes in the province are potentially active, three of them having erupted in the last few hundred years, two witnessed by First Nations and placer miners during the 18th and 19th centuries. The Tseax Cone, which last erupted in the 18th century, is the southernmost historically active volcano in the province, while Prindle Volcano in easternmost-central Alaska, which erupted during the Pleistocene period, is generally considered the northernmost. ===Structure=== Satellite image of Mount Edziza The Mount Edziza volcanic complex is Canada's second largest volcano of young volcanic activity, with an area of , exceeded only by Level Mountain north of Edziza, which has an area of . Four central volcanoes, known as Armadillo Peak, Spectrum Range, Ice Peak, and Mount Edziza, lie along the northerly trending axis of an oval, composite shield volcano. The composite shield volcano consists of overlapping shields, two of which are clearly noticeable on maps. The composite shield volcano forms a broad lava plateau, long and wide, mainly made of basaltic lava flows; it is dotted with cinder cones and surrounded by steep ridges called escarpments, which expose layers of black columnar basaltic lava flows with distal rock fragments and pyroclastic deposits. More light-coloured magmas of mainly trachyte and comendite with very little aluminum are mainly confined to the four central volcanoes and associated lava dome. The lava plateau is flanked by Klastline River to the north, Mess Creek and larger Stikine River to the west and the Iskut River to the east. Elevations of the lava plateau are with volcanic mountains rising above sea level. Three sections of the lava plateau have official names; these are the Arctic Lake, Big Raven, and Kitsu plateaus. The history of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex includes at least two periods of regional glaciation, when deep ice sheets covered the land, and several lesser advances of mountain glaciers. Stratovolcano composition The steep-sided, symmetrical stratovolcanoes in the region were built by repeated eruptions of thick, slow-moving lava that have commonly flowed only a few kilometres from the vent. Explosive eruptions are often associated with these volcanoes, depositing alternating layers of volcanic ash, cinders, blocks, and globes of molten rock called volcanic bombs or lava bombs, which are added to its slopes to create the stratovolcano. Edziza's stratovolcanoes contain a fine-grained silica-rich volcanic rock called trachyte; they have not erupted for thousands of years, allowing erosion to destroy the original cone, creating craggy ridges and rock outcrops of more resistant materials. Caldera composition Circular calderas in the Mount Edziza volcanic complex were formed as a result of emptying the magma chamber beneath a volcano. If enough magma is erupted, the emptied chamber will not be able to support the weight of the volcanic edifice above it. A roughly circular fracture‚Äî a \\"ring fault\\"‚Äî develops around the edge of the chamber. These ring fractures serve as feeders for fault intrusions that are also known as ring dikes. Secondary volcanic vents form above the ring fracture. As the magma chamber empties, the centre of the volcano within the ring fracture begins to collapse. The collapse may occur as the result of a single cataclysmic eruption, or it may occur in stages as the result of a series of eruptions. These caldera collapses are relatively small compared to most other caldera collapses. The largest caldera at the Mount Edziza volcanic complex is about in diameter while most calderas are at least in diameter. Volcanic eruptions accompanying these collapses produced trachyte and a white, sodic rhyolite called comendite. Map of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex Lava dome composition Edziza's rounded, steep-sided lava domes were built by eruptions of very thick light-coloured magma, including trachyte. Such magmas are typically too thick to move far from the vent it extrudes from, causing it to solidify quickly and build on previous volcanic extrusions, creating a characteristic dome-like shape. The thickness of the magma is attributed to high levels of silica, a naturally occurring silicon dioxide found in various crystalline and amorphous forms. Edziza's domes reach heights of several hundred metres, and grew slowly and steadily for months to years. The sides of these structures are composed of unstable rock debris. Due to the possibility of the building of gas pressure, the dome can experience more explosive eruptions over time. When part of a lava dome collapses while it still contains molten rock and gases, it can produce a pyroclastic flow, a super- heated mix of gas, ash, and pumice. Characteristics of lava dome eruptions include shallow, long-period and hybrid seismic activity, which is attributed to excess fluid pressures in the contributing vent chamber. Other characteristics of lava domes include their spherical dome shape, cycles of dome growth over long periods, and sudden onsets of violent explosive activity. The average rate of dome growth may be used as a rough indicator of magma supply, but it shows no systematic relationship to the timing or characteristic of lava dome explosions. Cinder cone composition The steep conical cinder cones of Edziza were formed by lava fountain eruptions, emitting particles and blobs of congealed lava from a single vent. As the gas- charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinder around the vent to form a circular or oval cone. Edziza's cinder cones have bowl-shaped craters at their summits and rise more than a hundred metres above their surroundings. Cinder cones are widespread in British Columbia as well as throughout other volcanic terrains of the world. Eve Cone, a black cinder cone of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex, is one of the most famous symmetrical and best preserved cinder cones in Canada, reaching a height of and a topographic prominence of . Shield volcano composition Edziza's shield volcanoes are built almost entirely of fluid lava flows. They formed as a result of lava flowing out in all directions from central summit vents and from groups of vents, building a broad, gently sloping cone of flat, domical shape. They are built up slowly by the accretion of thousands of lava flows of highly fluid basaltic lava, which spread widely over great distances, and then cool as thin, gently dipping sheets. In some shield volcano eruptions, basaltic lava has poured out quietly from fissure vents instead of central vents, flooding the surrounding countryside with lava flow upon lava flow, forming Edziza's broad lava plateau. Lava plateaus similar to Edziza's can be found elsewhere in North America, including the Snake River Plain in Idaho, and the Columbia River Basalt Group in southeastern Washington, and eastern Oregon, United States; they can also be found in Iceland. Subglacial mound composition Subglacial mounds (SUGM) of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex are an unusual type of subglacial volcano formed when subglacial eruptions began melting overlying glacial ice at a time when this region was covered by glacial ice during the Pleistocene and early Holocene periods. These subglacial eruptions were not hot enough to melt a vertical pipe right through the overlying glacial ice, instead forming mounds of hydrated volcanic rock made up of volcanic fragments called hyaloclastite and lava that solidified into pillow- shaped masses called pillow lava deep beneath the glacial ice field. Once the glaciers had retreated, the subglacial volcanoes would be revealed, with a unique shape as a result of their confinement within glacial ice. ===Eruptive history=== Armadillo Peak caldera The lava domes, calderas, stratovolcanoes, subglacial mounds and cinder cones forming the volcanic complex were constructed in five phases, each of which began with the effusion of dark olivine basalt which formed the flat-lying shield volcanoes and concluded with the eruption of light-coloured magma. This cyclical behavior is attributed to the episodic rise of basic, mantle-derived alkali basalt both to the surface and partly into crustal reservoirs where the light-coloured magmas with very little aluminum were created by prolonged crystal fractionation. The silica- rich trachyte and comendite lavas are similar to those associated with the most violent eruptions on Earth. Armadillo Peak eruptive period The first phase of activity resulted in the creation of Armadillo Peak seven million years ago, today represented by an eroded remnant of a small caldera flanked by steep-sided light-coloured secondary lava domes, including Cartoona Peak, Tadeda Peak, IGC Centre, and Sezill Volcano, and a thick pile of interlayered light-coloured lava flows, pyroclastic flows, air-fall pumice, and epiclastic deposits. It is the most central of the four central volcanoes and its summit is capped by of fine-grained silica-rich trachyte lava flows which were ponded inside the caldera to produce a lava lake six million years ago during its final stage of activity. Spectrum Range eruptive period Spectrum Range ice and red volcanic rock from heavy mineralization The second phase of activity began three million years ago, emplacing rhyolitic magma thick and long during a single event of activity. A broad circular lava dome was eventually created called the Spectrum Range. This is the southernmost of the four central volcanoes and is over wide and up to thick on the southwestern flank of Armadillo Peak and north of the Arctic Lake Plateau. Named for its extensive colourful alteration, it overlies a basal shield volcano and contains deeply carved circular valleys displaying portions of massive silica-rich comendite and trachyte lava flows which comprise the lava dome. The deeply carved circular valleys also display the bounding faults of a buried, cogenetic caldera approximately across. More than of rhyolite and trachyte was erupted during the Spectrum Range dome eruptive period, with its activity ending 2,500,000 years ago. Ice Peak eruptive period Glaciers and the eastern flank of Ice Peak Ice Peak, high, which overlaps the northern flank of Armadillo Peak, began to form during Edziza's third phase of activity, starting 1,600,000 years ago when the regional Cordilleran Ice Sheet began retreating. It is a stratovolcano that was constructed when large areas of the Edziza lava plateau were free from glacial ice and now enclosed by glacial deposits. However, additional parts of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex were likely still covered by glacial ice. The volcanic activity from Ice Peak during this period produced both basic and intermediate to light- coloured lava flows and pyroclastic rocks which mixed with meltwater to produce debris flows. As Ice Peak began to form, basic lava spread to the flanks of the cone where it formed meltwater lakes and combines with and forms part of the adjacent shield volcano. As lava continued to flow into these meltwater lakes, pillow lava and solidified rubble was created. Many of the lava flows with compositions of trachyte and basalt were however erupted just below the surface of the soil. Continuous volcanic activity eventually made Ice Peak reach an elevation of when three viscous, intermediate, and light- coloured lava flows built up around secondary lava domes parallel with its western side during its final stage of activity 1,500,000 years ago and develops nearly all of the steep, higher flanks of the volcano. These viscous light-coloured lava flows are displayed at two cliffs with broad faces, known as Ornostay Bluff and Koosick Bluff and contain basic rock made of solidified rubble overlain by large fractured lava with massive, poorly established pillars. Two cinder cones on Ice Peak's southern flank called Camp Hill and Cache Hill and possibly first erupted when glacial ice was still existing on the Edziza lava plateau. As lava flowed into the glacial ice above a vent, pools of meltwater were created. Continuous lava eruptions that flowed into the meltwater pools were cooled and fractured. This fragmental material was interrupted by explosions of steam, water, ash, rock, and volcanic bombs called phreatic eruptions. Camp Hill was eventually developed and over time it grew above water level inside the meltwater lake. Later eruptions produced a pyroclastic cone on top of the original fragmental cone. Cache Hill erupted when nearly all the glacial ice had retreated. The first lava flows from Cache Hill flowed through and dammed a river valley, which eventually ponded to produce a small lake. Subsequent lava flows traveled into the lake to produce pillow lava and solidified rubble. During the long period of Ice Peak activity, high-altitude glaciers developed and melted cutting valleys into the volcano. The current high summit of Ice Peak is a remnant of the western rim of a small summit caldera, which has been nearly destroyed by erosion from high-altitude glaciation. Near the end of Ice Peak activity 1,500,000 years ago, this high-altitude glacial ice combined with the regional ice forming part of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. It is likely that only the tallest mountains might have been visible over the Cordilleran Ice Sheet which was at least thick. A small volume of intermediate lava was erupted from Ice Peak compared to the other central volcanoes. Mount Edziza eruptive period Northwestern flank of Mount Edziza proper The fourth phase of activity began one million years ago when the Cordilleran Ice Sheet retreated from the upper flanks of the adjacent lava plateau, creating Mount Edziza proper which is the most northerly of the four central volcanoes. It is a steep-sided stratovolcano and the largest and highest of the peaks that form the volcanic complex with an elevation of , overlapping the northern flank of Ice Peak. The stratovolcano is made up of a fine-grained volcanic rock called trachyte and is associated with several lava domes which were formed by trachyte lava flows and explosive eruptions. Its smooth northern and western flanks, only slightly channeled by erosion, curve up to a circular summit ridge which surrounds a central, ice-filled caldera in diameter. Many glaciers cover Mount Edziza proper, including the Tencho Glacier on its southern flank. Active cirques on the eastern flank have breached the caldera rim, exposing the remnants of numerous lava lakes which ponded in the caldera 900,000 years ago and rest on hydrothermally altered breccia of the main conduit. Piles of pillow lava and hyaloclastite, formed by subglacial eruptions, are found on the flanks of Mount Edziza and nearby Ice Peak, as well as on the surface of the surrounding shield volcano. Pillow Ridge on Edziza's northwest flank was formed when basaltic lava erupted beneath the regional Cordilleran Ice Sheet when it was close to its greatest thickness. Central volcano flank eruptive period A large Edziza lava flow and the Eve and Sidas cones The fifth and final phase of eruptive activity occurred from secondary volcanic vents along the flanks of the four central volcanoes starting 10,000 years ago. This phase of activity began at a time when remnants of glacial ice were still present and continued after the glacial period. The initial flank eruptions, quenched by glacial meltwater, formed hyaloclastite tuff rings, whereas later activity created 30 small cinder cones, primarily of basaltic composition, including Mess Lake Cone, Kana Cone, Cinder Cliff, Icefall Cone, Ridge Cone, Williams Cone, Walkout Creek Cone, Moraine Cone, Sidas Cone, Sleet Cone, Storm Cone, Triplex Cone, Twin Cone, Cache Hill, Camp Hill, Cocoa Crater, Coffee Crater, Nahta Cone, Tennena Cone, The Saucer and the well-preserved Eve Cone. These cinder cones were formed no earlier than the year 700 based on the age of burnt plant stems still rooted in former soil under of loose basaltic fragments. These cinder cones were built on the basaltic fragments and blocky lava fields surrounding the cones. The Snowshoe lava field, on the southern end of the Big Raven Plateau, is one of the areas of young lava flows in the region while the Desolation lava field, on the northern end of the Big Raven Plateau, is the largest area of young lava flows, covering an area of 150 km2. The longest lava flow is . This volcanic activity was followed by at least two younger, but still undated eruptions, including an undated air-fall pumice deposit. The undated air-fall pumice deposit exists across the southwestern part of the Big Raven Plateau called Sheep Track Pumice or Sheep Track member. Pumice is a light volcanic rock full of air spaces and commonly pale in colour, ranging from white, cream, blue or grey, but can be green or black. The Sheep Track Pumice is mysterious because the vent of its origin is unknown, even though it is estimated from its state of preservation to be younger than 500 years. This pumice deposit emphasizes one of the significant volcanic hazards linked to the Mount Edziza volcanic complex ‚Äì the likelihood of a violent explosive eruption. The volcano that produced the pumice might be covered by glacial ice. Collaborators at the University of British Columbia have started work on samples collected from deposits of Sheep Track Pumice. ===Current activity=== Lava flows coming out of Mount Edziza The Mount Edziza volcanic complex is one of the eleven Canadian volcanoes associated with recent seismic activity: the others are Castle Rock, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley, Hoodoo Mountain, The Volcano, Crow Lagoon, Silverthrone Caldera, Mount Meager massif, Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and Nazko Cone. Seismic data suggests that these volcanoes still contain live magma plumbing systems, indicating possible future eruptive activity. Although the available data does not allow a clear conclusion, these observations are further indications that some of Canada's volcanoes are potentially active, and that their associated hazards may be significant. The seismic activity correlates both with some of Canada's most youthful volcanoes, and with long-lived volcanic centres with a history of significant explosive behavior, such as the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. The most recent volcanic activity at the Mount Edziza volcanic complex have been hot springs, several of which are found on the volcano's western flank, including Elwyn springs (36¬∞C or 97¬∞F), Taweh springs (46 ¬∞C or 115 ¬∞F), and inactive springs near Mess Lake. The springs are near the youngest lava fields of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex and are most likely associated with the most recent eruptive activity. These hot springs were highly important to the adjacent Tahltan people. Hot springs are closely associated with fumaroles, which are vents in an active volcanic area releasing steam and hot gases, such as sulfur dioxide. In general, the water is rotating groundwater that comes into contact with rocks heated by magma and finds openings to the surface. The formation of the springs depends both on the rocks the water has passed through and the profusion of volcanic discharges mixed with the groundwater. Iron oxide, iron sulfides and other substances usually colour pools of boiling mud brilliant yellow, red, brown or green. Hot springs comprising significantly softened silica may deposit it to form siliceous sinter, whereas those comprising softened calcium carbonate deposit spongy-looking calcareous rock called tufa. Overflow of the springs can build masses, spires or stepped terraces of calcareous sinter or tufa. ==Human historyIndigenous people=== As early as 10,000 years ago, the Tahltan First Nations people, who now live in Dease Lake, Telegraph Creek and the Iskut, used obsidian from the Mount Edziza volcanic complex to make tools and weapons for trading material. Most of the obsidian occurs at relatively high elevations at about . This is the main source of obsidian found in northwestern British Columbia, which was traded as far away as Alaska and northern Alberta. Obsidian is a type of naturally occurring glass that is highly valued for its cutting qualities and is produced by the rapid cooling of lava. Like all glass and some other types of naturally occurring rocks, obsidian breaks with a characteristic conchoidal fracture, creating razor sharp edges. A knife made of Edziza obsidian, possibly 2,000 years old, has been recovered in the Stikine River area. Two exposed columnar basalt formations exist within the volcanic complex: the Tahltan Eagle at the meeting of the Tahltan and Stikine rivers, and Pipe Organ Mountain. The Tahltan Eagle has significant spiritual and cultural importance to the Tahltan people, while the correct name and cultural significance of Pipe Organ Mountain to the Tahltan people is unknown. ===Geologic studies=== Lava fields of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex This area of long-lived volcanic activity has been studied and mapped in detail for many years by geoscientists. The first detail studying and mapping of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex was accomplished in the early 1970s by a Geological Survey of Canada society led by Canadian scientist Jack Souther. Edziza was a significant study area by Souther. While mapping, Souther looked at a mineral tenure map of Stikine Country and was surprised to see that many of the small cinder cones in the area had been maintained by mineral tenures. Upon investigation, the staking had been completed for the British Columbia Railway, then under construction to Dease Lake. The staking was designed to provide a ready source of weight for the railway bed. The Geological Survey of Canada agreed to support a series of Canada-wide lectures by Jack Souther to establish the Mount Edziza Provincial Park to protect the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. Coincidentally, Jack Souther had an opportunity to examine the Red Dog (Spectrum) property gold veins and he accomplished several section studies of specimens. It was not Souther's intention to include in the park any of the mineralization within near-surface older rocks. However, the British Columbia Ministry of Parks established the Mount Edziza Recreation Area covering on July 27, 1972 as the park proclamation, providing a wide buffer zone around the park area. On March 21, 1989, all but of the recreation area, covering the Spectrum gold property on its margin, was surreptitiously merged with Mount Edziza Provincial Park, almost doubling its size to . Cinder cones and Sheep Track Pumice Souther's studies in 1992 highlighted the importance and size of the region, and proposed that numerous subglacial eruptions emplaced lava in a sub-ice or ice- contact environment. More recent studies have worked on Souther's contributions with more detailed studies which are funded by colleges and universities. Since colleges and universities started studying the Mount Edziza volcanic complex, it has been an extremely important volcano for subglacial volcanism because its ice-contact lavas record evidence of ice existence and thickness in an area for which there is very little data on ice conditions before the Illinoian Stage of glaciation, which preceded the last glacial, or \\"Wisconsin\\", period. Several areas of possible basaltic and trachytic ice-contact products were studied in detail on the western flank of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex, in order to approve their ice-contact nature, and to eventually better constrain former ice existence and thickness. Its lava plateau has also been an important cultural resource. In 2006, Jeff Hungerford, a student of the University of Pittsburgh in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States, focused on fieldwork on the region surrounding Edziza's Tennena Cone, located immediately west of Ice Peak which formed subglacially during the early Holocene period when this area had remnants of glacial ice from the last ice age. Hungerford's studies in 2006 focused on subglacial volcanism, sampling pillow lavas to be used for degassing studies aimed at determining ice thicknesses during a subglacial eruption, and describing coeval glaciogenic sediments immediately underlying pillow lavas at the distal end of the lava flows. Hungerford also worked on describing glaciogenic sediments immediately underlying lava flows from Ice Peak adjacent to Tennena Cone, which may preserve a record of a one-million-year-old ice sheet. Satellite image of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex Kristen LaMoreaux, another student of the University of Pittsburgh, focused on the emplacement of trachyte lava flows and domes. In 2006, LaMoreaux analyzed jointing patterns at Ornostay Bluff, a viscous series of trachyte lava flows on the western lava plateau of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. LaMoreaux also examined trachytic lava flows from Koosick Bluff and Triangle Dome, a trachytic lava dome which last erupted during the Pleistocene period. Other studies by LaMoreaux determined criteria for understanding how lava flow thickness may or may not be an indication that the progress of a lava flow was impeded by an ice barrier, resulting in an unusually thick lava flow. Chira Endress, a student of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States, focused on a section of glaciogenic sediments immediately beneath the same Ice Peak trachyte lava flow sampled and described by Jeff Hungerford during his 2006 studies. Endress attempted to determine if the sediments were deposited immediately before the lava flow was emplaced, or if they are likely to be much older. Endress has quantified the mineralogy of clasts and sand-sized particles from samples in the sediment, and has determined that the mineralogy of several of the trachytic clasts is very similar to that in the overlying lava flow, including the minerals clinopyroxene, magnetite, alkali feldspar, and aenigmatite. Endress has also found small lenses of pristine basaltic glass, which could have derived from the Pillow Ridge subglacial mound near Mount Edziza. Alexander S. Lloyd, a student of Dickinson College, focused on the cooling rates of pillow lavas. Lloyd studied in detail the variation in crystal sizes from the edge pristine pillow lava, which could have derived from nearby Pillow Ridge which last erupted during the Pleistocene period. Courtney Haynes, another student of Dickinson College, focused on mathematics of the pillow lavas in 2007. ==Monitoring== Currently the Mount Edziza volcanic complex is not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active the volcano's magma system is. The existing network of seismographs has been established to monitor tectonic earthquakes and is too far away to provide a good indication of what is happening beneath the volcanic complex. The network may sense an increase in activity if the volcano becomes very restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption. It might detect activity only once the volcano has started erupting. A possible way to detect an eruption is studying Edziza's geological history since every volcano has its own pattern of behavior, in terms of its eruption style, magnitude and frequency, so that its future eruption is expected to be similar to its previous eruptions. While there is a likelihood of Canada being critically affected by local or close by volcanic eruptions argues that some kind of improvement program is required. Benefit-cost thoughts are critical to dealing with natural hazards. However, a benefit-cost examination needs correct data about the hazard types, magnitudes and occurrences. These do not exist for volcanoes in British Columbia or elsewhere in Canada in the detail required. Mount Edziza, Coffee Crater and Tencho Glacier Other volcanic techniques, such as hazard mapping, displays a volcano's eruptive history in detail and speculates an understanding of the hazardous activity that could possibly be expected in the future. A large volcanic hazard program has never existed within the Geological Survey of Canada. The information has been collected in a lengthy, separate way from the support of several employees, such as volcanologists and other geologic scientists. Current knowledge is best established at the Mount Meager massif in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt of southwestern British Columbia and is likely to rise considerably with a temporary mapping and monitoring project. Knowledge at the Mount Edziza volcanic complex and other volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province is not as established, but certain contributions are being done at least Mount Cayley, another volcano in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. An intensive program classifying infrastructural exposure near all young Canadian volcanoes and quick hazard assessments at each individual volcanic edifice associated with recent seismic activity would be in advance and would produce a quick and productive determination of priority areas for further efforts. South side of Cocoa Crater The existing network of seismographs to monitor tectonic earthquakes has existed since 1975, although it remained small in population until 1985. Apart from a few short-term seismic monitoring experiments by the Geological Survey of Canada, no volcano monitoring has been accomplished at the Mount Edziza volcanic complex or at other volcanoes in Canada at a level approaching that in other established countries with historically active volcanoes. Active or restless volcanoes are usually monitored using at least three seismographs all within approximately , and frequently within , for better sensitivity of detection and reduced location errors, particularly for earthquake depth. Such monitoring detects the risk of an eruption, offering a forecasting capability which is important to mitigating volcanic risk. Currently the Mount Edziza volcanic complex does not have a seismograph closer than . With increasing distance and declining numbers of seismographs used to indicate seismic activity, the prediction capability is reduced because earthquake location accuracy and depth decreases, and the network becomes less accurate. At carefully monitored volcanoes both the located and noticed events are recorded and surveyed immediately to improve the understanding of a future eruption. In countries like Canada it is possible that small precursor earthquake swarms might go undetected, particularly if no events were observed; more significant events in larger swarms would be detected but only a minor subdivision of the swarm events would be complex to clarify them with confidence as volcanic in nature, or even associate them with an individual volcanic edifice. ==See also== *Geology of the Pacific Northwest *List of mountain peaks of North America *List of Northern Cordilleran volcanoes *List of volcanoes in Canada *Mountain peaks of Canada *Volcanology of Canada *Volcanology of Western Canada ==References *Volcanoes of Canada Stikine Volcanic Belt (Mount Edziza area) *Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes ‚Äì Mount Edziza Category:Volcanoes of British Columbia Category:Mountains of British Columbia Category:Stratovolcanoes of Canada Category:Shield volcanoes of Canada Category:Lava domes Category:Complex volcanoes Category:Calderas of Canada Category:Stikine Country Category:Active volcanoes Category:Lava plateaus Category:Miocene volcanoes Category:Pliocene volcanoes Category:Pleistocene volcanoes Category:Polygenetic volcanoes Category:Hot springs of British Columbia Category:Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province Category:Tahltan Highland Category:Lava fields Category:Polygenetic shield volcanoes ","title":"Mount Edziza volcanic complex"},{"id":"19294571","text":"Danijel Mihajloviƒá (, born June 2, 1985 in VarvarinSportski ≈æurnal) is a Serbian footballer playing for Temniƒá. ==Statistics== {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"2\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Europe !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"2\\"Spartak Ljig 2003‚Äì04 4000000040 - !

At an isolated turnout in wooded Smedley Park in Nether Providence Township west of Paper Mill Road Station and east of Pine Ridge station, the line again becomes double-tracked for the stretch to the Media town border at Bowling Green station. ==Station layout== {table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 - style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" rowspan=4 width=50P Platform level - style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"Bidirectional style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"‚Üê toward Media ‚Äì Orange Street (Pine Ridge) toward 69th Street (Springfield Mall) ‚Üí - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-top:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\\" colspan=2Side platform, doors will open on the left or right - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray\\" width=100Street level style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray\\"Exit/entrance } ==External links== * *SEPTA - Paper Mill Road MSHL Station *Smedley County Park (Delaware County Parks Department) *Paper Mill; Media/Sharon Hill (Kavanaugh Transit Systems) *World-NYCSubways.org: **Paper Mill Road Crossing images **Crum Creek Bridge Fantrip (Undated) * Station from Paper Mill Road from Google Maps Street View Category:SEPTA Media‚ÄìSharon Hill Line stations ","title":"Paper Mill Road station"},{"id":"19294620","text":"Milo≈° Ristanoviƒá (Serbian Cyrillic: –ú–∏–ª–æ—à P–∏c—Ça–Ωo–≤–∏—õ ;born November 14, 1982 in ƒåaƒçak) is a Serbian professional footballer who plays for FK Kolubara in the Serbian First League. ==External sources== * Profile and stats at Srbijafudbal.

His profile in Ireland was raised by his participation in and eventual winning of the reality television series, F√°ilte Towers in August 2008. Creedon has also served as a judge on The All Ireland Talent Show on RT√â One and TG4's Gl√≥r T√≠re. He has also presented multiple television series on RT√â of him road tripping across Ireland showcasing Ireland's history, geography, along with some lesser known stories of the areas he visits. ==Career== Creedon's career began with an initial failed audition for a job on RT√â 2fm, but he went on to twice top the Irish Singles Chart with his character, Terence the Cork hairdresser. Terence was a frequent contributor to The Gerry Ryan Show in the early 1990s. Creedon won a Jacob's Award in 1992 for his RT√â Radio 1 morning show, Risin' Time. Over the years, Creedon has hosted shows on RT√â Radio One at various times of the day. The Creedon Show (15:30) was replaced by a programme hosted by Ronan Collins in 2006. This change followed new radio chief, Ana Leddy's decision to move him on as part of widespread alterations across the station. John also hosted Late Date on RT√â Radio 1 for some time prior to his move to the current 8 to 10pm slot. In August 2008 Creedon partook in the reality television series, F√°ilte Towers, a show that saw a group of well-known personalities attempt to run a hotel for a two-week period whilst earning money for charity. Creedon was proclaimed winner of the show on 17 August. Creedon selected Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin as his charity for the show due to heavy personal involvement with the hospital in the past. In 2007, his granddaughter Lucie was born prematurely to his daughter, Katie, who suffered from kidney problems as a child. Lucie died eight and a half weeks later. Commenting on the win, Creedon said: \\"The big fat guy never wins anything, this is great.\\" After his victory, he presented a show for the RT√â Concert Orchestra\\"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly - A Tribute To The Wild West \\" - presented by John Creedon.

Judge Creedon warned fellow judge D√°ith√≠ √ì S√© to stop stealing acts from Munster, alleging that he invaded County Clare in series one and that he would be \\"answerable to me and to my gang\\" if he continued to persist. After a short stint presenting Late Date, he was given his own 20:30 weekday music show on RT√â Radio 1 in 2009. In 2011 Creedon hosted a television series called 'Creedon's Retro Road Trip' in which he retraces the route of the only holiday his entire family ever took. His family's holiday took place in 1969 with his eleven brothers and sisters who travelled across Ireland in his father's Mercedes along with a borrowed caravan. The holiday was a two-week road trip across Ireland. John Creedon recreates the trip over forty years later and takes off on his own journey to see how the country has changed. Creedon's next television series was titled 'Creedon's Cities' in which he visits the four major Irish cities Dublin, Galway, Limerick, Cork. The series aired in 2012. 'Creedon's Wild Atlantic Way' aired in 2015. It was a big leap in production compared to his two previous series. The series consists of 3 episodes showcasing points of interest along the Wild Atlantic Way. Creedon travels along this famed tourism route in his 1960s VW campervan nicknamed the ‚ÄòSeanvan‚Äô by Creedon after the old Irish song An tSean Bhean Bocht. == Filmography == {  +Television !Year !Title !Role - 2007 No B√©arla Actor - 2008 F√°ilte Towers Contestant - 2009 The All Ireland Talent Show Judge - 2011 Creedon's Retro Road Trip Presenter - 2012 Creedon's Cities Presenter - 2015 Creedon's Wild Atlantic Way Presenter - 2017 Creedon's Shannon Presenter - 2016 Creedon's Epic East Presenter - 2018 Creedon's Road Less Traveled Presenter } ==Critique== After his turn on F√°ilte Towers, journalist and RT√â colleague Joe O'Shea described Creedon's personality as being that of \\"somebody who gives space to others and is not intent on sucking up all of the available on-screen oxygen\\". In March 2008, it was to Creedon's radio show that befuddled Irish listeners turned when RT√â shut down its 82-year-old medium wave service. Within hours of the shutdown, they were contacting John Creedon's RT√â radio show, \\"wondering how they could tune in to the newfangled VHF ‚Äì or ‚ÄúVHI‚Äô‚Äô, as one gentleman insisted on calling it\\". In an interview about his television series 'Creedon's Shannon' he talks of an old review of him that called him a \\"third rate presenter\\". While it did upset him at the time he recalls that his daughter Nanci told him \\"I‚Äôd rather be a third-rate presenter than a first-rate critic\\" a sentiment to which he says ‚ÄúI‚Äôve kept that one in my back pocket, d‚Äôyou know?‚Äù. ==Personal life== Creedon was raised with eleven siblings. He claimed in a 2008 Late Late Show interview that he once worked in a Penneys branch. He previously lived in Goatstown, Dublin, but now resides in a quiet but cosmopolitan district of Cork, on a steep hill overlooking the city centre. He is known for his eclectic musical taste, from local band Fred to The Beatles, Nina Simone, Bruce Springsteen and Van Morrison. His record collection includes albums by Miles Davis and John Coltrane and selections from Americana, Eric Bibb, John Prine and the Handsome Family. An avid Irish language speaker, Creedon appeared on the first series of No B√©arla, broadcast in 2007. He has spoken to the BBC about his search for his nation's favourite Irish word. He supports his local football club, Cork City F.C., a League of Ireland Premier Division team. One of Creedon's favourite memories is the visit of Pope John Paul II to Ireland in 1979. He described the Pope \\"landing that helicopter by himself in Phoenix Park in 1979\\" as \\"truly memorable\\". ==References External links == * Official site of The John Creedon Show * * John Creedon rap from The All Ireland Talent Show * Late Date archives: February 2008 April 2008 * 2003 letter to the Sligo Weekender Category:Living people Category:Cork City F.C.

I've been working really hard this season, and I'm very grateful.. It [being selected for the West Indies] would be on my mind, but the only thing I can do is to go on and perform to my best.

So I'll just wait and see what they'll do.\\" International ODI debut Subsequent to end of the West Indies domestic season, Australia toured the Caribbean.

In one game against Trinidad he took 8 wickets and scored 86. ===2009: Test debut=== Miller made his Test debut on 9 July 2009. He was part of an understrength team fielded by the West Indies against Bangladesh; the 15-man squad included nine uncapped players. Including Miller, seven West Indies players made their debut and the side was captained by Floyd Reifer who had played the last of his four Tests ten years earlier. The first XI had made themselves unavailable due to a pay dispute with the West Indies Cricket Board. ===2009‚Äì10=== Miller toured Australia with the West Indies team in 2009-10. He took 3-51 in a game against the Prime Ministers Xi. At home Miller took 22 first class wickets at 12.86 with a best return of 7-28. In one day cricket he took 4-47 against Zimbabwe helping the West Indies to a rare series win, and 3-15 against Canada. ===2010‚Äì11=== In August 2010 Miller was given his first central contract by the WICB, though it was not renewed in October 2011. He only took five first class wickets that summer. He took 2-8 for West Indies A against Pakistan A in a T20 and 2-4 for Jamaica against Somerset. ===2011‚Äì12=== Miller had an excellent season in 2011-12 taking 49 first class wickets at 10.76, with a best of 5-16. ===2012‚Äì13=== In 2012-13 Miller took 52 first class wickets at 8.05, including six five-wicket hauls, a best of 7-13. He played for West Indies A against Sir Lanka A, scoring 6-141 and making 50 not out in one game, and taking 6-51 and 2-23 in the one dayers. He also helped his club, Melbourne CC, win the national 50 overs title. In the 2012 ICC World T20,he along with Sulieman Benn set the record for the highest 10th wicket partnership in T20 World Cups(20).This pair's record has been equalled by Steve Finn-Jade Dernbach record partnership for the last wicket in T20 World Cups. In 2013 he toured with the West Indies and took seven first class wickets. ===2013‚Äì14=== Miller took 13 wickets over the tour of India with the West Indies A side. He was their leading bowler. At home he took 30 first class wickets at 25.2. ===2014‚Äì15=== Miller took 17 wickets in 2014-15 at 14.05. He toured Sri Lanka taking two first class wickets. Miller was a part of the 2015 West Indies 15 man World Cup squad. ===2015‚Äì16=== Miller took 65 first class wickets in 2015-16 at 16.86 with a best of 8-67. ===2016‚Äì17=== In November 2016 during the 2016‚Äì17 Regional Four Day Competition, he took 5-22 against the Windward Islands, helping Jamaica to a narrow victory. A month later he took career- best figures of 9/41 in the second innings of a match. These figures were also the best in West Indies' domestic cricket. He ended the tournament as the leading wicket-taker, with 58 dismissals in ten matches at 14.29, matching his feat from the 2015-16 edition. It was again raised why Miller was not playing international cricket. \\"If called up to do a job [by West Indies], will do to best of ability - but my mind is not really on it,\\" Miller said. \\"The one thing I'd say about criticism of whether I could replicate my domestic performances at Test level, and can only speak for myself - I have played in A team cricket in 2013 versus India and Sri Lanka, playing against guys like [Virender] Sehwag, [Gautam] Gambhir, [Cheteshwar] Pujara, Yuvraj [Singh] and got five-wicket hauls and was the leading West Indies A wicket-taker. Yes, the standard (of West Indies domestic cricket) could improve to another level, but if it was I believe I'd still do well, because if you're good, you perform despite the standard.\\" Miller also took 3-12 in nine overs in a 50 over game against Combined Campuses & Colleges. ==Lack of international representation== Nikita Miller's lack of international critic has mystified some. Miller had been overlooked in favour of Shane Shillingford, Devendra Bishoo, Sunil Narine, Veerasammy Permaul and Jomel Warrican. One writer said \\" I keep hearing that he doesn't really spin the ball and doesn't get the bounce of, say, a Sulieman Benn...I have heard that he has disciplinary issues, but that can't be substantiated. As far as I know, he has never been put before a disciplinary panel and found guilty of any serious offence. The Nikita Miller I know is outspoken, and will stand up and say what he believes. There are times when he may rub authorities the wrong way with his willingness to speak up, but others have played far more often for the West Indies with far greater baggage on their resume.\\" ==References * Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:West Indies Test cricketers Category:West Indies One Day International cricketers Category:West Indies Twenty20 International cricketers Category:People from Saint Elizabeth Parish Category:West Indian cricketers of the 21st century Category:Jamaican cricketers Category:Cricketers at the 2011 Cricket World Cup Category:Cricketers at the 2015 Cricket World Cup Category:Jamaica Tallawahs cricketers Category:Jamaica cricketers Category:Trinbago Knight Riders cricketers ","title":"Nikita Miller"},{"id":"19294695","text":"The women's 52 kg judo competition at the 2008 Summer Paralympics was held on September 7 at the Beijing Workers' Gymnasium.

It is said that they noticed the staff would sit on bags filled with styrofoam during their coffee and cigarette breaks. The original beanbag chair was called \\"Sacco\\", which was a pear-shaped leather bag filled with styrofoam beans and is still in production today. Bean bags can be made from materials including leather, suede, corduroy and fake fur. Polyester bean bags are waterproof and can be used outdoors. Giant bean bags can also be used as a cheap alternative to buying a sofa or couch. Quite a variety of bean bags are sold, including baby bean bags that are known for helping babies that suffer from colic. They are also known for helping with plagiocephaly or more commonly referred to as flat head syndrome in babies. In August 2014, Ace Bayou Corp recalled 2.2 million bean bag chairs in the United States due to a design fault which allowed the chairs to be unzipped by children.

The game is particularly popular in American elementary schools as a safer alternative to dodgeball. ==Other uses== * Bean bags are used as bean bag round ammunition for non lethal impact weapons. * Clutching technology for robots makes use of bean bags. * Smaller bean bags can be used to stabilize a camera when a tripod is not available. ==ReferenceswikiHow To Make a Bean Bag Category:Bags Category:Physical activity and dexterity toys Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Bean bag"},{"id":"19294769","text":"is a mixed-use redevelopment project in Fukushima-ku ward of Osaka City, Japan, located on the former site of Osaka University Hospital. == Facilities == *Headquarters of Asahi Broadcasting Corporation *:ABC Hall *D≈çjima River Forum (hall) *The Tower Osaka (residential) *River Residence D≈çjima (residential) *:Keio University satellite campus *:Osaka University of Arts satellite campus *D≈çjima Crosswalk (shops, restaurants) *:Gold's Gym == Neighbouring public facilities == *Osaka Nakanoshima Combined Government Office Building *National Museum of Art, Osaka *Osaka Science Museum *Osaka International Convention Center == Transport links == *Keihan Electric Railway Nakanoshima Line Nakanoshima Station (3-5 mins walk) *Hanshin Electric Railway Main Line Fukushima Station (5-10 mins walk) *JR T≈çzai Line Shin-Fukushima Station (5-10 mins walk) Category:Buildings and structures in Osaka Category:Residential skyscrapers in Japan ","title":"Hotarumachi"},{"id":"19294774","text":"The Things That Matter is the first studio album released by American country music artist Vince Gill.

Born in Youngstown, Ohio, he appeared in two seasons in Major League Baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1952‚Äì53. He batted and threw right-handed during his baseball career. == Professional career  Early years === Yuhas was signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1942. The New York Yankees traded him to the Cardinals in 1943 in an unknown transaction. After missing several seasons during World War II, he returned in 1947, pitching in the minor leagues for five seasons. === Major leagues === In 1952, Yuhas made his major league debut with the Cardinals at age 27. In 1952, Yuhas went on to go 12‚Äì2, with a 2.72 earned run average. Yuhas led the Cardinals in 1952 with Won-Loss % (.857), games (54), and wild pitches (4). Yuhas' win-loss percentage was also the best in the National League, while his appearances placed him third. In the games category, Yuhas was only behind Joe Black (56), and future Hall of Fame inductee Hoyt Wilhelm. The Cardinals went on to record an 88‚Äì66 record in the National League, finishing third in the standings. Yuhas finished in a five-way tie for thirty- first place in the 1952 National League Most Valuable Player voting. In 1953, however, Yuhas appeared in only 2 games. In one inning, Yuhas had an 18.00 era, with three hits and two earned runs given up before suffering an arm injury that kept him out the rest of the season. With Yuhas out of action, the 1953 Cardinals fell to an 83‚Äì71 record. They did, however, maintain third place in the standings. Yuhas never recovered from his arm trouble, having played in his last game on April 28 of 1953. At the time of his retirement Yuhas had a 12‚Äì2 record, a 2.72 ERA, 35 walks, and 39 strikeouts. Yuhas was 4 for 21 hitting, with a lifetime batting average of .190. His lifetime fielding percentage was .947. Yuhas, along with Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio, is one of only three players to receive MVP votes in all but one of his Major League seasons. ==See also== * List of St. Louis Cardinals team records == Notes References== Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:St. Louis Cardinals players Category:Baseball players from Ohio Category:Fond du Lac Panthers players Category:Winston-Salem Cardinals players Category:Rochester Red Wings players Category:Omaha Cardinals players Category:Caribbean Series players Category:1924 births Category:1986 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Youngstown, Ohio ","title":"Eddie Yuhas"},{"id":"19294812","text":"The 1990-91 Cup of Yugoslavia was the second last season of SFR Yugoslavia's football knockout competition.

He survived and upon his return to England was presented to Queen Victoria, along with several of his human colleagues. ==Life== Bobbie belonged to Lance-Sergeant Peter Kelly of the 66th Regiment of Foot (the Berkshire Regiment). He was initially stationed at Brock Barracks, and went overseas with the regiment in the late 1870s.Reading Evening Post: Memorial for dog hero of Maiwand In 1880 the regiment was stationed at the fort in Kandahar, Afghanistan, which had been occupied by the British since January 1879, just after the start of the Second Anglo-Afghan War. On 3 July 1880, a column of some 2,700 troops under Brigadier George Burrows set out from Kandahar to assist friendly tribesmen in putting down a rebellion by Ayub Khan. Bobbie accompanied the troops. For ten days, Burrows searched for the rebel force. Meanwhile, the friendly tribesmen turned out not to be so friendly, leaving Burrows' force to face an ever-increasing rebel army in countryside where every man's hand was ready to turn against them. Eventually, the British force was surrounded and attacked by a much larger Afghan force. Along with a line of Indian regiments and cavalry, the 66th Foot made a determined stand while the guns were evacuated, Bobbie barking furiously at the attackers. The British were overrun, over half of the 66th Regiment being wiped out, while the survivors had no option, but to retreat to Kandahar. In the confusion, Bobbie got lost, but the following day, survivors making their way back to the fort spotted him trying to catch up, though he was wounded. He was re-united with his owner, who was also on the wounded list. Upon arrival back in England, Bobbie was presented to Queen Victoria, along with several soldiers of the regiment, who received Distinguished Conduct Medals. Bobbie was awarded the Afghanistan Medal. A year later, Bobbie was accidentally run over and killed by a hansom cab in Gosport, Hampshire. He was stuffed and can be seen today at The Rifles Berkshire and Wiltshire Museum in Salisbury. He was loaned to Reading Museum for a World War One exhibition.https://www.getreading.co.uk/news/local-news/gallery/6951227 ==Memorials== As well as the display in the Regimental Museum at Salisbury, Bobbie is featured on a commemorative coin given to those who attended the 2004 opening of the Animals in War Memorial in Hyde Park in London.garenewing.co.uk/angloafghanwar/articles/dogs.php ==References * Dogs in the Second Anglo-Afghan War * Picture of Bobbie * Two paintings of Bobbie in the thick of the fight Category:Military history of Berkshire Category:Individual dogs ","title":"Bobbie (dog)"},{"id":"19295025","text":"The service mark symbol (the letters in small capitals and superscript style), is a symbol used in the United States and some other jurisdictions to provide notice that the preceding mark is a service mark.

Early stages of the competition were run in three regions (northern, central, and southern), with the National League teams receiving a bye until the Fourth Roundof the competition. In all, 131 teams took part in the competition. Note: Different sources give different numberings for the rounds of the competition: some start round one with the beginning of the regional qualifications; others start numbering from the first national knock-out stage. The former numbering scheme is used in this article. ==The 1979 final== The final was the second all-Auckland final clash, the first having been between the same teams (but with a different winner) in 1973. North Shore's Adrian Elrick and Keith Hobbs appeared in both finals (the latter as a substitute in the first match), as did Mount Wellington's Tony Sibley and Bill de Graaf. North Shore won the final for a then-record equalling fifth time. The final was the first of five in a row to feature Mount Wellington. The final has been described as \\"the one that slipped away\\", as the expected venue, Newmarket Park, was made unavailable after a small landslide destroyed much of the playing area. McLennan Park in Papakura stepped in as a replacement. Mount Wellington would have gone into the match as clear favourites, but the sending off of play-maker Brian Turner in the previous match rendered him suspended from the final,l evening the two sides up considerably. p.78 In the first half goals were traded, with the Mount's John Leijh opening the scoring only for Keith Hobbs to level the score for North Shore. Early in the second spell Mount Wellington's Stewart Carruthers was sent off, tipping the scales towards the North Shore side. The Mount were entrenched deep in their own half for much of the remainder of the match but Iain Ormond was brought down in the box and slotted the ball home from the resulting penalty to take the cup over the WaitematƒÅ. ==ResultsThird Round=== * Won on penalties by Napier City Rovers (5-3) and Eden (5-4). ‚Ä† Halswell United and Wellington City disqualified ===Fourth Round=Fifth Round=Quarter-finals=== * Woolston won 4‚Äì2 on penalties ===Semi- finals=Final=References== *Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation New Zealand 1979 page *UltimateNZSoccer website 1979 Chatham Cup page Category:Chatham Cup Chatham Cup Chatham Cup Chat ","title":"1979 Chatham Cup"},{"id":"19295068","text":"V√•rberg is a station in the Stockholm metro in the neighbourhood V√•rberg in S√∂derort, Stockholm Municipality.

Located in Saint-F√©licien, the zoo is dedicated to wildlife conservation of the boreal climate and is managed by The Centre for Conservation of Boreal Biodiversity inc. The Zoo Sauvage de St- F√©licien is an accredited member of the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA). ==History== A polar bear at the zoo ===The original zoo=== The zoo was founded in 1960 through the initiative of Ghislain Gagnon and six others who opened it on an abandoned fox farm lent to them by Haldaige Laflamme. The zoo was set up as a traditional zoo that showcased exotic and North American animals. On January 4, 1961, the Fondation de la Soci√©t√© zoologique de St-F√©licien inc (English: St-F√©licien Zoological Society Foundation inc.) was registered as a non-profit society. One month later the foundation purchased √éle-aux-Bernard and of land from Paul E. Gagnon for $12,000, no interest, and payments of only $500 per year. By 1968, the zoo owned more than , and was home to 450 animals of 91 species. By this time, the zoo also included a restaurant, a kitchen, and a souvenir shop. Additional land was purchased in 1969, bringing the zoos holdings up to . Ghislain Gagnon began wondering if there was a better way to keep animals other than in cages, which resulted in the zoo being completely rethought. ===Nature Park Trails=== The zoo opened its Nature Park Trails on September 10, 1972. The \\"new zoo\\" covered about and included a screened-in \\"train\\" with about of roadway, from which visitors could observe animals that are native to Quebec, freeing the animals to larger enclosures and putting the visitors in the cages. An additional of land was purchased in 1974, and work began on expanding the Nature Park Trails. The expansion of the Nature Park Trails officially opened in 1978, with a new lake (Lac Montagnais) having been dug and Mount Keewatinook erected. There were now of roadway in the Nature Park Trails, as well as reproductions of historic sites including the Colonist Farm, the Lumberjack Camp, the Trading Post, the Indian Campground, the Grand Trestle, and the Western Ranch. ===The St-F√©licien Zoological Society Foundation=== A cougar at the zoo In the early 1980s, the zoo was financially strong and received over 300,000 visitors to its park. It became obvious through visitor comments that the demand for more educational focus at the zoo was growing, and the zoo came up with a Zoo of the Year 2000 plan, and the St-F√©licien Zoological Society Foundation (French: Fondation de la Soci√©t√© zoologique de St-F√©licien) was created in 1981 to help implement such a transformation. In 1985, work began to create habitats adapted to each animals way of life and to remove the animals from their cages. In order to house carnivores such as their big cats, three large paddocks were built. In addition, the chimpanzee habitat was constructed so the animals were contained only by a fence surrounding the water basin, in order to keep people out. The zoo also constructed new homes for giraffes, elephants, and hippotamus with walls and ditches replacing cages to separate visitors from the large animals. In 1986, a work conflict caused a zoo lockout for three months and threatened to close the zoo. A re-launching committee was formed by Benoit Laprise, the mayor of St-F√©licien, and in early 1987 was able to raise $1,300,000 to save the zoo from closure. The committee received help from numerous employees, citizens, municipalities, corporations, and governments. That same year, the zoo made organizational changes both at the employee and administrative levels, and the St-F√©licien Zoological Society Foundation created their new mission statement with a focus on education, research, natural, and cultural patrimony, which was part of the Zoo of the Year 2000 plan. In the next two years, the zoo won many regional awards and changed its name to the Zoo Sauvage de St-F√©licien in 1989, to reflect its new focus. In the 1990s, the Wild Zoo won first prize in the Quebec Tourism Regional Awards and was awarded the National Grand Prize under the category 'Touristic Promotion,' although, the Wild Zoo would go through numerous changes during the early nineties. Ghislan Gagnon, the zoo's original founder retired on December 31, 1992, leaving Martin Laforge to manage the zoo. In September 1993, the Wild Zoo solved its problem with wastewater discharging into the rivi√®re-aux-saumons. The Wild Zoo would use artificial swamps to treat the wastewater that came from the zoo and the campground before it entered into the rivi√®re-aux-saumons. This ecological project was one of the first steps in sustainable development of the zoo. In order to finance the project, the zoo received subsidies, but needed to sell the campground to cover its portion of the cost. A caribou at the zoo ===The focus on Nordic animals=== During the same year, a committee was created to decide whether or not the Wild Zoo should abandon its exotic animal collection. The idea to make the decision came from considerations that the Wild Zoo needed its own niche to attract clients believing that visitors seeing exotic animals in other institutions needed to have an interest to come back to the Wild Zoo for its unique and specific style. Lastly, the Wild Zoo committee also believed that they were contradicting themselves between the traditional/exotic zoo (animals in cages) and the Nature Park Trails where free indigenous fauna roamed free. The committee decided that only a huge investment would be used to restructure the traditional part of the Wild Zoo and insure its survival, as well, to make it stand out from other zoos. Through this conclusion the committee decided to remove its exotic animal collection in 1993, and shifted its focus towards animals that live in Nordic environments. Through this decision, the Wild Zoo's finances were healthier due to the loss of exotic animal species that were more costly to maintain due to their nature and different environments they are accustomed to. In the following years, major renovations began that included the √éle-aux-Bernard (1995), the Valley Sector (1996), and the new polar bear habitat (1997), while new constructions such as the Great Aviary, the Kids Garden, the Ghislan Gagnon Interpretation Centre were being added. Buildings that were no longer needed were turned into veterinary clinics in order to meet Quebec government and Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA) standards. Through these changes, the Wild Zoo animal cohabitation was no longer restricted to the Nature Park Trails and visitors could see animals roaming freely everywhere on the site when the Wild Zoo reopened its doors in the 1997 winter season, being accessible for all four seasons, which for most Canadian zoos is impossible to do. Through these changes and innovations the Wild Zoo led the way as being a model for other Zoological Parks in Quebec and followed through with Gagnon's original vision. ===The Centre for Conservation of Boreal Biodiversity=== In May 2001, the Wild Zoo decided to broaden its mission statement by modifying its focus again and became the Centre for Conservation of Boreal Biodiversity (French: La Fondation du Centre de conservation de la biodiversit√© bor√©ale (CCBB)). The new CCBB wanted to increase the benefits of its organization on a local, regional and international level by following the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity that was adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Through this change and model, the Wild Zoo shifted its efforts from Nordic towards protecting the biodiversity of the boreal forests through preservation, education, and research. Shortly, Phase I of the plan commenced with the construction of the Borealium, which is a Visitors' Centre, in addition, to being a research, documentation, and education facility. In recent years, the Wild Zoo built new exhibits and eventually re-introduced exotic animal species to its collection that lived in the boreal environments of Asia. In 2010, the Wild Zoo introduced exotic species that live in the boreal environments of Mongolia through the remodeling of an island and opened the Mongolian habitat. At the same time, a family area with water games, and a small farm was also built. ===Polar bear cubs=== On December 4, 2009, the polar bear, Aisaqvak gave birth to two cubs. This was the first time a Canadian zoo experienced the birth of twin polar bears. The polar bear cubs at first were only viewed from a hidden camera inside the den and eventually at three months of age wandered outside with their mom away from public viewing. When the cubs were six months old, they made their first public appearance at the Wild Zoo in June 2010. ==Exhibits== * Arctic - The most popular exhibit at the Wild Zoo where visitors have an underwater view of polar bears. * Mixed Forest - Showcases species from various forest and ocean environments. Visitors will be able to see harbor seals, river otters, raccoons, porcupines, bald eagles, great blue herons, wolverines and fishers. * Mountain - This exhibit contains North American wildlife that would roam the mountain landscapes. Visitors can see numerous predators such as the cougar, the bobcat, the Canadian lynx, the coyote, the grizzly bear and the mule deer. * Nature Trail Park - The first area at the zoo to have a free roaming area for animals. Visitors can observe these animals while riding inside a train with caged bars and observe large mammals such as the American bison, the moose, the northern elk, the woodland caribou, the musk ox, the black bear and white- tailed deer. * Land of the Caribou - Visitors can observe caribou from Lac Montagnais while paddling their canoes. * Asia - Animals in this exhibit are exotic species that live in Asian boreal environments.

They were descended from and take their name after one Arduin (Harduoin). The first of the Arduinici to enter Italy was Roger, son of Arduin, who was established as count (comes) at Auriate in the early tenth century. He extended his power and was succeeded by his son Arduin Glaber, named after his grandfather, who established the family as one of the most powerful in northwestern Italy. He conquered the Susa Valley and allied with Provence against Fraxinetum. He ruled the counties of Auriate, Turin, Asti, Albenga and probably Bredulo, Alba, and Ventimiglia. During a reorganisation of the structure of Italy's marches under Berengar II in 950, Arduin's territories were organised as the March of Turin, or marca Arduinica. Arduin allied his family with the House of Canossa by marrying his heir, Manfred I to Prangarda, daughter of Adalbert Atto of Canossa. The family later drew itself close to the Holy Roman Empire. Arduin's grandson, Ulric Manfred (Odalrich-Maginfred), was one of the most powerful noblemen Italy in the 1020s, when he tried to play kingmaker and give the throne to William V of Aquitaine. Ulric Manfred's daughters, Adelaide and Irmgard, married high- ranking German princes: Hermann IV of Swabia and Otto III of Swabia, respectively. Irmgard later married Egbert I, Margrave of Meissen, one of the richest magnates in Germany, and Adelaide, through her marriage to Otto of Savoy, was the mother of Bertha, empress of Henry IV and of another Adelaide, who married the German anti-king Rudolf of Rheinfelden. Adelaide (died 1091) was the last scion of the house; her heirs were her sons Peter I and Amadeus II of Savoy. The Arduinici possessions in Italy formed the basis for Savoy power there and of the later Duchy of Savoy, Kingdom of Sardinia and Kingdom of Italy. ==References== *M. G.

She is known for her travels to Egypt and the popular books she wrote afterwards. In 1863, Lott went to Egypt, tasked with teaching a 5-year-old son of Egyptian Viceroy Isma'il Pasha. She kept the position for two years, before returning to England and writing several books about her experiences. One of these accounts was The English Governess in Egypt: Harem Life in Egypt and Constantinople (1867).Peterson and Brothers, 1865 Lott believed that her position as a \\"humble individual\\" and member of the household provided her with a more authentic perspective than that of aristocratic visitors such as Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, for whom the harem was tidied up for public viewing. Lott's tone towards Egyptian women is often contemptuous - she claims that far from being Oriental beauties of European fantasy, they are \\"hideous and hag-like\\". Lott believed herself to be superior to Egyptians by virtue of her race; it was a shock to find that as a governess, she was treated as a servant and a social inferior. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Lott, Emmeline, The English Governess in Egypt: Harem Life in Egypt and Constantinople, Bentley (London 1866) Category:19th-century British women writers Category:19th- century British writers Category:English orientalists Category:Year of death missing Category:Year of birth missing Category:English governesses Category:English non-fiction writers ","title":"Emmeline Lott"},{"id":"19295410","text":"Roni Bowers and her daughter, Charity The 2001 Peru shootdown was an incident on 20 April 2001, in which the Peruvian Air Force shot down a civilian floatplane, killing American Christian missionary Veronica \\"Roni\\" Bowers and her infant daughter Charity. While flying into the Loreto Region of Peru, Bowers, her daughter Charity, husband Jim, and six-year-old son Cory were being followed by a United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) observation plane. The Peruvian Air Force was operating as part of the Air Bridge Denial Program. The CIA did not attempt to identify the tail number of the church-owned plane per procedure. ==Events leading to death== In a video released by the CIA, the CIA observers can be heard discussing whether the Cessna A185E (with Peruvian registration OB-1408), which had departed the town of Islandia; near the Brazilian border, is a \\"bandido\\" (drug plane) or an \\"amigo\\" (friendly). A CIA officer then tells a Peruvian Air Force (FAP) official that it may be possible to have the plane land in Iquitos to check. The FAP plane then issues a warning to the plane for not having an authorized flight plan, but the pilot did not hear it because he was on a different frequency. As the Dragonfly prepared to open fire, a CIA officer can be heard saying that the plane \\"doesn't fit the profile\\", and another CIA official says, \\"Ok, I understand this is not our call, but this guy is at 4,500 feet and he is not taking any evasive action. I recommend we follow him. I do not recommend phase 3 [shooting the plane down] at this time.\\" Later, a Peruvian official asks if \\"phase 3\\" is authorized, and the CIA official replies asking if he is \\"sure it's a bandido\\". The Peruvian official replies in the affirmative, and the CIA officer says, \\"If you're sure.\\" The CIA pilot then says, \\"This is bullshit\\" and \\"I think we're making a mistake.\\" The second CIA officer says, \\"I agree with you.\\" The Dragonfly approached, at which point the pilot of the Bowers' plane makes contact with the Iquitos control tower, noting that the FAP has showed up, and he is not sure what they want. In the confusion, the CIA plane notes that the pilot Bowers' plane is in contact with the tower, but at 15:55 the Dragonfly opened fire with a minigun. The pilot can be heard yelling, \\"They're killing me! They're killing us!\\" The CIA officer says, \\"Tell them to terminate!\\" and another officer is heard saying \\"No! Don't shoot! No m√°s! [No more!]\\" At this point, the plane is already on fire, and the CIA observed the plane crash into the Amazon River, in the Pebas District, and turn upside down. A CIA officer remarks that if the FAP has a helicopter in the area, they should get it there to rescue them. The CIA plane then observes a boat in the river attempting to rescue the plane's occupants, and one officer says, \\"Get good video of this.\\" Over the intervening several years since the incident, many had stated that the CIA \\"ordered\\" the Peruvian Air Force to shoot down the plane, when this is not the case. Bowers and her seven-month-old daughter were killed in the shooting. The pilot, Kevin Donaldson, was shot in the leg but managed to land the plane. Roni's husband and her son were not injured. ==Aftermath== After the event, the US government temporarily suspended the practice of advising foreign governments on shooting down planes over Peru and Colombia. It also paid compensation of $8 million to the Bowers family and the pilot. The program was discontinued in 2001. According to a statement released by the CIA, its personnel had no authority either to direct or prohibit actions by the Peruvian government, and CIA officers did not shoot down any airplane. In the Bowers case, CIA personnel protested the identification of the missionary plane as a suspect drug trafficker.

He redefined the art of muscle reading to such an extent that this technique, also known as \\"contact mind reading\\" and \\"Cumberlandism\\" (after a 19th-century practitioner named Stuart Cumberland), is now best known by the name \\"Hellstromism\\".Mason, Tom; Danko, Dan; Railing, John; Orleans, Danny. (2001). The Book of Mentalism. Scholastic. p. 34. ==Biography== Hellstrom was born Axel Vogt. He lived in Germany and fought in World War I where he watched a man perform an act of muscle reading. At the time, Germany did not allow mind reading unless it had a plausible explanation. The only type of mind reading allowed was muscle reading, and so Axel took advantage of it. He studied it carefully and taught himself everything. He entertained his fellow soldiers and became quite good at this old technique. After the war, he and his wife moved to America where he knew his art form would be accepted by many - especially the magic audiences. Soon he was performing for professional magic audiences and amazed many people. After a short while, mind readers, and even fellow Hellstromists were questioning his ability. During his live performances, his manager spoke for him because his English vocabulary was limited. Hellstrom would successfully complete many different challenges such as locating hidden items, performing actions that others were thinking of and determining which object someone had selected out of many options. The accuracy of his results was astonishing and he was soon known throughout the United States. He was well-respected by his peers in the stage magic community, and other performers paid hundreds of dollars to learn the secrets behind his technique.Hellstromism by S.W. Reilly During the 1930s, the American magician and mentalist Robert A. Nelson published the definitive book on Hellstrom's techniques, with his cooperation. This book, \\"Hellstromism,\\" has remained an important reference on the subject of muscle reading well into the 21st century. Modern practitioners of Hellstromism include the magicians Banachek and Kreskin. ==References== Category:1893 births Category:1933 deaths Category:German magicians Category:Mentalists ","title":"Axel Hellstrom"},{"id":"19295738","text":"The women's 70 kg judo competition at the 2008 Summer Paralympics was held on September 9 at the Beijing Workers' Gymnasium.

Episodes have generally aired once a week since 2006, and run about an hour long. The podcast is described as \\"A weekly roundup of America through the eyes of two American- Americans\\". ==Overview== Uhh Yeah Dude (AKA America's Podcast) is a weekly hour long comedy podcast containing discussion about current events by hosts Seth Romatelli and Jonathan Larroquette. The original idea for the podcast came out of weekly phone conversations between the two where they would talk about personal experiences and items they'd seen in the news. The two had joked about recording their conversations and, after a year or so, Larroquette suggested they record it and turn it into a podcast. The exact content of each show varies but episodes typically include items from popular culture, \\"news of the weird\\" stories, results from scientific studies, personal anecdotes and a range of other material. Current events or major news stories are rarely discussed. Over time certain themes or topics have recurred (both intentionally and accidentally). The show also features its own unique vocabulary which has been described as \\"a combination of repurposed hip-hop patois and bro-speak\\". The first episode of Uhh Yeah Dude aired on February 11, 2006. It is typically recorded weekly in Romatelli's apartment in East Hollywood. The two have also done live shows in many cities including Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, Brooklyn, Dallas, and Boston. Some have credited the podcast's intimacy and the hosts' accessibility as part of its appeal. The two have spoken candidly about their neuroses and personal lives. At one point Larroquette gave out his personal phone number and answered calls and texts from fans. The show's listeners are also encouraged to call a dedicated 1-800 number and leave a voicemail which Romatelli monitors and sometimes responds to personally. The podcast is also somewhat unusual for not featuring guests. Romatelli described this as a conscious decision to not have a show involving \\"listening to this person get interviewed for the 35th time about how awesome and rich they are.\\" The one guest the podcast has featured is Romatelli's mother who has hosted along with her son on several episodes. ==Reception== Uhh Yeah Dude has received positive reviews in a number of publications including Rolling Stone, Paste Magazine, IFC and Los Angeles Magazine. In July 2013 the show was featured in a segment on New Zealand's TV3 calling them \\"America's funniest podcast.\\" It has also been recognized by other podcasters as one of the original comedy podcasts. The duo were featured in an episode of WTF with Marc Maron where Maron called them \\"pioneers, godfathers; one of the original podcasts.\\" Comedian Dave Anthony has cited them as an inspiration for his own Walking the Room podcast. ==References * *Uhh Yeah Dude iTunes *Uhh Yeah Dude Twitter Category:Audio podcasts Category:Comedy and humor podcasts Category:2006 podcast debuts ","title":"Uhh Yeah Dude"},{"id":"19295832","text":"Chatsworth train accident can refer to two different train accidents in the United States: *2008 Chatsworth train collision in southern California *1887 Great Chatsworth train wreck in eastern Illinois ","title":"Chatsworth train accident"},{"id":"19295841","text":"The William J. Dickey House is located on Imperial Avenue in Cohoes, New York, United States. It was built for Dickey, the superintendent of a local textile mill, in 1890, by an unknown architect. It is a well-preserved example of local Queen Anne-style residential architecture. In 1998 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. ==Property== The house is a frame two- story three-bay home with a cross-gabled roof that comes to a jerkin shape in the front (west) side. A porch wraps around the first story to the south elevation. The south bay on the front side is projecting, with Stick-style decoration between the second-story window and roofline. On the south side is another projecting two-story bay with similarly tall bay window. The north profile features a round-arched stained glass window that illuminates a staircase. The interior retains much of the original finishing. Most noteworthy among it is the wall plaster, architraves and door surrounds. In the rear of the property is a small barn with clapboard siding and a gabled roof. It is considered a contributing resource and is now the house's garage. ==History== Imperial Avenue was one of the first streets laid out after Cohoes reincorporated as a city in 1869 and extended the municipal boundary to the west, opening up possibilities for new homes for the city's managerial class. It runs across the top of a sharp rise a mile west of downtown. Dickey's house is at the highest point on the street. The Cohoes Daily News of March 1, 1890, reported on Dickey's move into his new house. He and his wife, having taken up residence a few days previously, received a surprise visit from their friends, who gave them a hanging lamp as a housewarming gift. Ten years later, in the early 20th century, the stained glass window was put in. There have been no other significant alterations to the house since then. It remains a private residence today. ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:Houses completed in 1890 Category:Cohoes, New York Category:Houses in Albany County, New York Category:National Register of Historic Places in Albany County, New York ","title":"William J.

Her grandfather, Vasily Pavlovich Lepeshinsky, was arrested as a member of the revolutionary organization Narodnaya Volya. Her father, Vasily Vasilievich Lepeshinsky, was a railway engineer, one of the builders of the Chinese Eastern Railway. From the early years Lepeshinskaya showed her talents in dancing and in the 1925 she was admitted to the Bolshoi Choreographic School. She appeared for the first time on the stage of the Bolshoi Theatre at the age of ten as one of the little birds in the ballet The Daughter of the Snows. In 1932 she played the Sugar Plum Fairy in The Nutcracker ballet. ==Prima ballerina== Lepeshinskaya graduated from Bolshoi Choreographic School and started working the Bolshoi Theatre. She started as Rosina in a ballet of The Barber of Seville (–¢—â–µ—Ç–Ω–∞—è –ø—Ä–µ–¥–æ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å) performed by the second stage of the theater. In 1935 she performed the main role in the Three Fat Men ballet by Yury Olesha. The ballet became very popular and the 18-year-old ballerina became famous. Lepeshinskaya performed in private concerts at the Moscow Kremlin from the age of 17. She was very close to Polina Zhemchuzhina, wife of Vyacheslav Molotov. It was a great shock for her when Zhemchuzhina was imprisoned in a Gulag.

He was arrested on 19 October 1951 as an alleged participant in the fabricated Zionist Plot in MGB. Lepeshinskaya claimed that her appeals to Stalin saved the life of her husband. In March 1953, after Stalin death, Leonid Raykhman was freed, rehabilitated and appointed the head of MVD Control Commission. In August 1953 he was arrested again that time for his own fabrications of criminal cases, tortures of prison inmates and other violations of the \\"Socialist Law\\". He was sentenced to five years in prison in August 1956 but amnestied in November 1956.

The ballet was a great success. In 1941, when the Stalin Prize was established, Olga Lepeshinskaya was among the first laureates of the prize for her performance in Don Quixote. Altogether Lepesinskaya received four Stalin Prizes. With the beginning of the Great Patriotic War Lepeshinskaya became a member of the Front brigade of the Bolshoi Theater. The brigade performed near the front lines, in hospitals, in Moscow and in Saratov where the Bolshoi was evacuated. Lepeshinskaya was a member of the brigade until the end of World War II. Her performances near the battlefields were filmed in the 1941 Soviet Documentary Kontsert - Frontu (Concerto to the Front).Kontsert - Frontu on IMDb In 1942, the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee was organized. Lepeshinskaya was its Deputy chairperson. In 1943, she starred as Assol in the Bolshoi premiere of Scarlet Sails. On May 9 she was with her Bolshoi brigade with Soviet troops in Warsaw. The next day she received her invitation to perform in the Bolshoi's production of Cinderella. The ballet, first performed on 21 November 1945, was the first post-war show at the Bolshoi. Lepeshinskaya won her second Stalin prize for her performance. She received her third Stalin prize for her performance in the Flames of Paris and the fourth prize for the Tao-Hoa role in The Red Poppy. In 1951 she received the People's Artist of the USSR title along with Galina Ulanova. ==Teacher== She married Soviet General Aleksei Antonov in 1956. In 1962 her husband died. The nervous shock was so strong that she became temporarily blind. When her vision returned, after a year of treatment, she found herself unneeded by the Bolshoi Theater or the Bolshoi School. Fortunately, she found a place at the Komische Oper Berlin where she worked as a ballet mistress for ten years. After this she worked as a trainer in many different companies throughout the world. For thirty years she served as the Chairperson of Ballet competitions in Moscow. She was the president of the Russian Choreographic Association (from 1992) and was the Chairperson for the Choreography Entrance Exams at the Russian Academy of Theatre Arts (for her last fifty years). She helped painter Ilya Glazunov during his early career (she was reprimanded for organizing his first exhibition), so he declared Lepeshinskaya to be his godmother in the art. Lepeshinskaya died of a heart attack on December 20, 2008 in Moscow at the age of 92. ==Honours and awards== *Order of Merit for the Fatherland; **2nd class (28 September 2006) - for outstanding contributions to the development of national choreography and many years of fruitful work **3rd class (12 September 1996) - for outstanding contribution to the development of national culture *Order of Lenin (1971) *Order of the October Revolution (1986) *Order of the Red Banner of Labour, twice (1951, 1966) *Order of the Badge of Honour (1937) *Medal \\"For the Defence of Moscow\\" *Medal \\"For Valiant Labour in the Great Patriotic War 1941-1945\\" *People's Artist of USSR (1951) *People's Artist of RSFSR (1947) *Honoured Artist of the RSFSR (1942) *Stalin Prizes; **1st class (1941) - for outstanding achievements in the field of ballet **1st class (1946) - for performing the title roles in the ballet \\"Cinderella\\" by Prokofiev **1st class (1947) - for her performance as Joan in the ballet \\"Flames of Paris\\" Asafiev **2nd class (1950) - for her performance as Tao Hoa in the ballet \\"The Red Poppy\\" by R.

(1768‚Äì1842), by his wife Harriet, (1779‚Äì1855) daughter of Charles Rashleigh, of Duporth, Cornwall. ==Life== He was educated at Ottery St Mary school, and trained for the law, being admitted to practise as a solicitor in Trinity term 1832. In January 1833 he settled at Penzance, where he entered into partnership with George Dennis John. On John's death in 1847 Messrs John and Rodd became John, Rodd and Darke and after the latter's death the firm became Rodd & Cornish. He had also held many official posts in the town. He was town clerk from 1847, clerk to the local board from 1849, clerk to the Board of Guardians from the passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, and superintendent registrar, besides being head distributor of stamps in Cornwall from 1844 to 1867. Rodd retired about 1878 leaving the practice to Thomas Cornish. He died unmarried at his home, 4 South Parade, Penzance on 25 January 1880, and was buried in St Clare Cemetery, between Penzance and Heamoor. A carillon, costing about ¬£300 and paid for by public subscription, was installed in St Mary's Church as a memorial to Rodd. The first to be erected in Cornwall, it was completed by Gillett, Bland & Co on 10 November 1880 and plays fourteen tunes. A tune was played for two weeks, every four hours at 8 am, noon, 4 and 8 pm, midnight and 4 am. The carillon uses the eight bells, which were installed in 1865 for ¬£950. ==Ornithological studies== Rodd was an ardent ornithologist, and especially interested in the question of migration. He studied minutely the avifauna of Cornwall, and it was entirely due to his exertion that many a rare bird was rescued from oblivion, while several species were added by him to the list of British birds. He contributed upwards of twenty papers on ornithological matters to The Zoologist, the Ibis, and the Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall from 1843 onwards. His collection of at least forty-five cases with 270 specimens, mostly from Cornwall, passed to his nephew Francis R Rodd, at Trebartha Hall, Launceston.

However, Flava Works filed a lawsuit against the City of Miami in response to the verdict, invoking First Amendment rights and arguing that it was not running an adult-oriented business out of the \\"House Next Door.\\" Flava Works also argued that business transactions do not take place in a residential neighborhood in Miami, but rather in virtual space.See Michael Vasquez, \\"Miami fights to shutter house where online porn is filmed,\\" The Miami Herald (August 14, 2008), p.

Cooke of the United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, ruled in favor of Flava Works.\\"Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment,\\" United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, Case No. 07-22370-CIV Cooke/Balestra. She based her judgment on the precedent of a very similar case involving a heterosexual porn site, \\"Voyeur Dorm,\\" operating webcams in a Tampa, Florida, residence. The judge ruling on the Voyeur Dorm case came to the conclusion that the residence provided no \\"offer[ing] [of adult entertainment] to members of the public.\\" The offering occurs when the videotaped images are dispersed over the internet and into the public eye for consumption \\"Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment,\\" United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, Case No. 07-22370-CIV Cooke/Balestra, p. 6, quoted from Cooke agreed, writing on the CocoDorm: \\"Because the public offering by Flava Works, Inc. occurs via cocodorm.com in cyberspace, and not in a particular geographic location, the City of Miami zoning ordinance cannot be applied to the 503 residence.Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment,\\" pp. 9‚Äì10.

The city appealed, and in June 2010 the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that regardless of whether the CocoDorm was an adult entertainment establishment, it was a business operation, and Miami zoning ordinances forbid operating a business in a residential zone. The court distinguished the Voyeur Dorm case by pointing out that the latter involved a Tampa ordinance against adult entertainment establishments, not business operations in general. ==Flava Works Inc. v.

E. Knight, who is also known for writing the Vampire Earth series of novels. == Plot == The series follows the adventures of three dragon siblings. All having hatched from a clutch of five eggs carefully protected by the female dragon Irelia and her mate, bronze AuRel, the young dragons quickly establish themselves into distinct roles. Upon hatching, the males of the clutch are instinctively driven to fight each other to the death, which leads to the death of a Red hatchling, while the Copper suffers a crippled leg and must live as an outcast, leaving grey Auron to dwell with his two sisters under the protection of their parents. All four hatchlings survive their first seasons in the cavern, until an attack on their home cave results in the deaths of their mother and the female hatchling Jizara. Auron and Wistala escape into the Upper World, while the crippled Copper eventually makes his way deeper below ground. In the fantasy setting of the novels, dragon population has been dwindling as relations among the many races worsen. Humans especially are becoming the dominant species, but there are still powerful factions of dwarves, elves and other sentient species. The first three books are written from a different sibling's point of view and occur simultaneously. They are stand-alone novels that are accessible without having read the other two. ===Dragon Champion (Book 1)=== * Perspective: AuRon Dragon Champion follows AuRon (Auron), the youngest male and clutchwinner. After being separated from Wistala, he is captured and sold to humans buying dragon hatchlings. He escapes and sets forth to seek the dragon NooMoahk because of a rumour that the ancient black knows the secret of dragonkind's supposed fatal weakness. Along the way he encounters many friends and future allies, the Dawn Roarer wolf pack, the tradesdwarf Djer, Naf the mercenary and the girl-child Hieba. AuRon studies under NooMoahk for a time and then comes to rule a small kingdom of the local blighters after the latter's death. However, the blighter ruler he had installed is killed by rivals who wish to lead all blighters to war with the humans. AuRon comes to learn of the Wyrmmaster who believes in human supremacy and wishes to wipe out the other races. The blighter war was instigated by him to destroy the other races. The Wyrmmaster is so named because he uses dragons to fight his wars; it was to him AuRon would have been sold to as a hatchling. AuRon volunteers and infiltrates to serve the Wyrmmaster and finds the \\"fatal\\" weakness of dragons: the fact that they imprint upon the first creature they see upon hatching and can then be tamed. With the help of the female dragons AuRon leads a successful uprising against the Wyrmmaster. AuRon mates with Natasatch and hopes to raise his children so that the males do not kill each other upon hatching, ending the book. ===Dragon Avenger (Book 2)=== * Perspective: Wistala Dragon Avenger follows Wistala, the sole surviving female. After being separated from Auron, she tracks down their gravely-injured father and spends some weeks nursing him back to health. However, Wistala and AuRel are found by the dragon hunter Drakossozh, and after her father is killed she is forced to leap into a gorge to escape. She is rescued, unconscious and near death, by a kindhearted elf named Rainfall who becomes an adoptive father to the orphan. During her stay with Rainfall, Wistala becomes involved in a conspiracy by the local thane Hammar to claim Mossbell, Rainfall's ancestral home. She later travels with a circus as a fortune teller, briefly roaming the land after uncasing her wings in search of dragons who can help her avenge her family's deaths. After an unsuccessful meeting with a small group of ambivalent dragons in the north, Wistala returns to the circus and wins favor with a dwarf named Gobold Fangbreaker, the ruler of the Wheel of Fire and the same dwarf responsible for the murder of her parents. Wistala manipulates his downfall from a position of trust, instigating a war between the dwarves and the human barbarians of the north and sabotaging the dwarves, leading to the downfall of the stronghold. Wistala slays Gobold and later encounters the Dragonblade, who agrees to end the bloodshed between their families. The book ends with Wistala preparing to leave in search of AuRon, who she finds is still alive. Dragon Avenger spans the least amount of time of the first three books, following Wistala's first 14 years or so. ===Dragon Outcast (Book 3)=== * Perspective: the Copper (RuGaard) Dragon Outcast follows the copper as he explores the lower world. Meeting with blood-sucking bats and dwarves, he makes his way to a community of dragons in the Lavadome, where he is adopted into the imperial family by the current ruler, the Tyr, and named RuGaard. RuGaard deals with politics and hominids, and searches for his place in a world of treachery and war. During his stay in the Lavadome, he becomes the owner of the human thrall Rayg, the lost great-grandson of Wistala's adopted elf father. He is later forced to mate with the sickly dragonelle Halaflora by the Tyr's mate. Not long after the Tyr dies and his brother-in-law SiDrakkon becomes Tyr. Rayg succeeds in crafting a brace for the wing that Drakossozh crippled in RuGaard's infancy, enabling the Copper to fly. Emissaries of the Wyrmmaster arrive and attack the Copper's home of Anaea, shortly after SiDrakkon dies under mysterious circumstances and his nephew SiMelovant becomes Tyr and arranges peace with the invaders. After the accidental death of Halaflora, RuGaard leads a successful assault against invading dragonriders and kills the Dragonblade, Drakossozh as well as SiMelovant. With the victory, RuGaard is named Tyr (king) of the Lavadome dragons, with his drakehood love Nilrasha as his mate. Nearly all of Dragon Outcast takes place in the lower world. ===Dragon Strike (Book 4)=== * Perspective: AuRon, Wistala and the Copper (RuGaard) Dragon Strike is the fourth book, but the sequel to the first three concurrent books. Despite victory over the Demen, RuGaard's Tyrship is threatened when a plague from blighted kern sweeps through Lavadome, killing hatchlings and the eldest dragons. He considers alliance with either Hypatia or Ghioz. Wistala sets off to find AuRon, and takes up with the Blighters in his old cave, both made more clever and more fearful by the magical gem Sunshard she finds there. The caves are attacked by Ghiozi forces; she defeats two dragons, defectors from the Lavadome, but breaks a wing and falls down a deep well during a fight with DharSii, an attractive warrior dragon she met in Book 2. Deep below ground, Wistala is captured by Demen refugees under Pastinix; despite poor treatment, when she is rescued by Firemaidens she helps Pastinix escape and promises to speak on their behalf with the Tyr of the Lavadome. Meanwhile, AuRon hears of Wistala from treasure hunters, and leaves the Isle of Ice to find her and gold for his hatchlings. He meets her friends, then DharSii, both of whom recommend hiring himself to the Red Queen of Ghioz. This many-masked, clever, and powerful woman gives him an amulet and sends him to negotiate an alliance with the Lavadome dragons. While searching for an entrance, he sees Naf's forces being firebombed by Ghiozi roc riders. Landing to help put out the flames, he is disturbed by stories of his employer's cruelty. DharSii, AuRon, and Wistala all arrive in time for the same meeting in the Lavadome. DharSii warns of a massive force of Ironrider mercenaries and warriors of Ghioz, AuRon is taken over by the magical amulet and threatens the Lavadome before attacking his brother Tyr RuGaard, and Wistala‚Äînow a member of the Firemaidens‚Äîpins him and breaks the amulet from his neck. RuGaard, having received confirmation from his bat spies that the kern was deliberately poisoned by the Ghioz, asks Wistala to negotiate an alliance with Hypatia and declares war on Ghioz. The siblings again separate. AuRon helps Nef defeat a group of Ironriders, then leads them against Ghioz. RuGaard recaptures Pastinix, and with his help, leads the Lavadome's Aerial Guard in a sneak attack on Ghioz through the tunnels. Together, they humble the city, though Nef dies, and when AuRon burns the Red Queen a mysterious blue light, invisible to all but dragon eyes, leaves her body and flies away. He discovers many other embryonic Red Queen bodies growing in magical tree roots deep under the tower. Meanwhile, Wistala was unable to rally Hypatia, but with a small force of firemaidens held the northern passes against Iron Riders for long months before rocs and dwarves forced her badly outnumbered forces into ineffective raids. Faced with a trickle of riders from the north and a more substantial force from the south, Hypatia surrenders. Nilrasha defies RuGaard's orders, and leads the firemaidens to rally Hypatia, leaving the Lavadome nearly undefended. Together, they rout the Ironriders and retake the city, though Nilrasha is almost fatally injured by collapsing building and forced to bite her own wing off. Over the next months, dragons and human survivors form a strong alliance and look for a better future. ===Dragon Rule (Book 5)=== Perspective: AuRon, Wistala and the Copper (RuGaard) Dragon Rule is the fifth book and was released on 1 December 2009. Wistala, as sister to the Copper who is now Emperor of the Upper and Lower Worlds, is appointed proxy Queen by crippled Nilrasha, where she advances her ideas of political equality of hominids and dragons. Which puts her at odds with both her brothers, for the Copper has no use for the humans he now dominates, and AuRon, the rare scaleless grey, would isolate himself and his family from both the world of men and the world of dragons. The Copper sends AuRon to bring his old friend Naf's territory Dairuss into the Great Alliance, which he does successfully and becomes its protector. Imfamnia and NiVom, defectors and protectors of neighboring Ghioz, try to get him to join a conspiracy of dragon supremacists and Ibidio's traditionalists who want to see control returned to the Imperial bloodline. Though an assassination attempt, accusation of murder, and attack by Wheel of Fire dwarves all fail, it erodes the Copper's position sufficiently for a coup. The siblings, all tired by court intrigues, give up without a fight (though Nilrasha kills Ibidio when she comes to gloat). They go peacefully into exile on the Isle of Ice, only to be again attacked by a group led by Imfamnia, and flee to the isolated Sadda-Vale where Wistala secretly mates with DharSii. ===Dragon Fate (Book 6)=== Perspective: AuRon, Wistala and RuGaard Dragon Fate starts out with RuGaard, Wistala and AuRon all taking shelter away from the Lavadome (as they were exiled in the last book). Wistala goes with DharSii to hunt a troll while AuRon has returned to visit his mate. While Wistala and DharSii are hunting, they learn that NiVom and Imfamnia have tried to take power from the twins and another clan war has broken out. == Characters Main characters=== * AuRon (Auron, Long-Tail Fire-Heart, Firelong): AuRon is the champion of his clutch, being the last surviving male to remain on the egg shelf. He is rare among dragons in the fact that he has no scales, and thus is termed a \\"grey\\"; however, his skin color actually changes to match his surroundings. Scaleless, he is lighter and able to fly longer and faster than other dragons. He makes less sound than his scaled brethren. Additionally, AuRon has no appetite for metals, which normal dragons crave and consume to replace their scales. He is energetic and slightly headstrong, though he can be very serious and is extremely smart. AuRon is rare among dragons in that he keeps his egg tooth, which later hardens to become a horn of sorts, which he uses to aim his fire. In his opinion he believes dragons should not interfere with the tribulations of the hominid races, though he does see the problems of isolating himself in an area with no metal for his family. * Wistala (Tala): Wistala, the first of two females to hatch in the clutch, has a sharp wit, and is very self-confident. Due to the traumatic destruction of her home, Wistala becomes something of a tomboy rather than being interested in typical dragonelle behavior, such as mating. Her scales are green, as is normal for most females. She shows a thirst for knowledge after being taken in under Rainfall and becomes a librarian of Hypatia. She also shows a particular interest in the dragon DharSii, who later becomes her love interest and eventual mate. From her mother she takes the lessons of how to improvise and to learn from the mistakes of the dragons from Silverhigh, a famed dragon empire destroyed by complacency. Though having promised her father to bear a fruitful clutch, she is the only dragon to remain unmated at the end of her book, though at the end of the series, she and DharSii are revealed to be expecting their second clutch of eggs (the first clutch was promised to Scabia in exchange for living in the Sadda Vale during their exile). She believes dragons can coexist peacefully with the hominids. She is stronger than most dragons (to the point where she can fly while wearing her brother RuGaard's armor) and is thicker scaled then most dragonelles. * The Copper (RuGaard (Formal Adult name taken when wings come in), Rugaard): The Copper was the first of the three males in the clutch to hatch. Together with Auron, they killed the third male (who had ruby-red scales), but then Auron forced him off the egg shelf, dooming him to a life of namelessness and self-sufficiency (as their parents more or less would not pay attention to a male besides the clutchwinner). He learns to be very resourceful, though, even with the multiple debilitating injuries he acquires: a crippled leg from the fall off the egg shelf, a hurt eye from a fight with Wistala, a stab that cripples his wing from the Dragonblade (for which he eventually is given an artificial wing joint), and a stab to the fire bladder from a group of Demen. The only piece of advice given to him from his mother is to overcome and create a new line all his own. Out of all the siblings he seems to have been given the highest position, yet he still feels estranged from other dragons. He receives the name \\"Rugaard\\" upon reaching the Lavadome, though in the narration is still referred to as \\"The Copper\\". He is eventually killed by the trolls commanded by his former thrall, Rayg. However The Copper is rumored at the end of the series to still be alive. === Siblings' family === By heritage Italicized‚Äìnames married into the family; Bold‚Äìnames are male; ‚Ä†‚ÄìKnown to be dead; ‚Ä°‚ÄìStatus unknown; ?‚ÄìName unknown * Jizara: Jizara is the only sibling that did not survive the raid of the Egg Cave. She is described as being thinner and longer than Wistala, and has a wonderful singing voice (as described by The Copper). She is also the only one who shows any real kindness to the Copper. She is killed by the Dragonblade during the raid of the Egg Cave, her last breaths being used to beg for mercy. * The Red Hatchling: This red hatchling was the second male to hatch, but was killed by AuRon and the Copper. * AuRel: A bronze dragon with a storied lineage. He is the father of the siblings. AuRel returns from hunting to find the Egg Cave being attacked. He escaped, but with serious injuries. Wistala finds AuRel wounded and unable to fly, and tries to heal him. While returning from a search to find metal for him, she unknowingly leads The Dragonblade to AuRel. AuRel attempts to fight The Dragonblade, but being injured makes him unable to fight. The Dragonblade kills AuRel as Wistala watches. * Epata: The mother of AuRel. * AuRye: A red dragon; the father of AuRel. After destroying an army of humans, he was killed when he faced a second army, filled with survivors of the old, that countered his tactics. A very famous dragon, from the Skotl clan of the Lavadome, AuRye was renowned for his thick scale and skill in warfare, smashing armies. He is recognized by AuRel as impulsive but also very mighty- one of the strongest dragons ever to exist. * Irelia: The calm, sensible mother of the siblings. She is green, as is common for females. Irelia is killed in the Raid on the Egg Cave. * Wistala I: The mother of Irelia, and thus the maternal grandmother of the Siblings. * EmLar: The father of Irelia. He was the grey whose genes were passed to AuRon. * NiVom: The grandson of EmLar, a cousin to the Siblings. Meets the Copper in the Drakwatch and becomes a full commander. As of Dragon Rule, the siblings and NiVom do not appear to be aware of their relation. NiVom is poisoned by Imfamnia, who is later revealed to be possessed by The Red Queen, in Dragon Fate. * AuNor: The ancient ancestor of the siblings, whose line they belong. * AuSurath: A red and the first of AuRon's sons, headstrong and impatient. He later joins the Aerial Host and rises to the position of commander of the Heavy Wing of the Aerial Host. * AuMoakh: A gold and the second son of AuRon, observant and methodical. By mating * Natasatch: A green female dragon who is enslaved and sold to the Wyrmmaster. Along with other females she was kept captive and forced to help the wizard breed his army for years, later helping to stage an uprising and evicting the humans from the isle. She becomes AuRon's mate at the end of Dragon Champion. In \\"Dragon Rule\\" she develops a keen interest in the newly emergent Empire society that leads to her separation from AuRon during his exile. * Nilrasha: An ex-Firemaiden, she worked alongside the Copper during the events of Dragon Outcast and fell in love in spite of (or maybe perhaps because of) his unique physical disabilities. She is the center of much controversy, partly because of her breaking the Firemaiden's oath of virginity to mate with the Copper and also because of the suspicious circumstances surrounding Halaflora's death which many believe she was directly responsible for. The aristocracy of the Lavadome resent her meek beginnings and accuse her of being a relentless social climber. She is later injured during the Battle of Hypatia and rendered flightless, leading to her being forced into an unofficial retirement from the political scene. * Halaflora: The sickly granddaughter of FeHazathant and Tighlia, she becomes RuGaard's first mate through an arranged mating by Tighlia as a means to legally bind him to the family, although the Copper doesn't truly love her. Although the circumstances of her death is unclear - as the only one around at the time is Nilrasha and she has motive to kill Halaflora - Nilrasha claims that Halaflora thought herself pregnant and, confused, starts to rapidly consume meat. However, Halaflora's sickly nature made her too weak and she chokes on a piece of bone and dies. The Copper and many others view the story with skepticism, but do not dare voice their opinion to Nilrasha. * DharSii: First appears in Dragon Avenger, is mentioned in Dragon Outcast, features in Dragon Strike and Dragon Rule as well as Dragon Fate. Described as orange or red with several dark stripes along his back. According to several other characters in the series, striped dragons like DharSii are usually sterile and rarely father hatchlings. Former commander of the Aerial Host in the Lavadome. The name DharSii is an assumed name taken after a fatal duel with AgGriffopse, Tyr FeHazathant's only son. DharSii translates roughly as sure-claw or quick-claw, a reference to the manner of AgGriffopse's death. Wistala and DharSii secretly mated in Vesshall, producing a clutch given to Scabia's daughter in exchange for living in Vesshall. At the end of the series, they are revealed to be expecting another clutch they intend to raise themselves and have revealed that they are mated. ===Recurring characters=== * Hazeleye: Hazeleye is an elf who captures, studies, and traffics dragons. Despite her job she displays a great deal of compassion for dragons and is often at odds with her compatriots. She frees AuRon as a hatchling after growing disillusioned with a dragon-trapping trade and is crippled for her actions. She is one of the only characters to interact with all three of the siblings. * The Dragonblade (Drakossozh):The Dragonblade is a man who dedicated his life to hunting down dragons; he has two weapons designed to do just that, a spear, Byltzarn (the White Spear of Lightning), and a sword, Dunherr (the Thunder's Edge). He is hired by Gobold to get revenge upon two dragons that cheated him. As a result, he directly kills AuRel and Jizara. In his career only three dragons survive or are spared by the Dragonblade: AuRon, Wistala and The Copper. He is one of the only characters to interact with all three of the siblings. At the end of Dragon Avenger Wistala and he put an end to their mutual feud and he retires, only reluctantly battling the Copper at the end of Dragon Outcast. The Copper killed him in their final duel. * Eliam Dragonblade: Son of the Dragonblade, he is seen as short-tempered and arrogant. In contrast to his father he is sadistic and cowardly; more of an executioner than a warrior and afraid to face dragons on equal terms. He lost his left eye to Wistala during the sacking of Mossbell and is killed by AuRon during the revolt on The Isle of Ice. * Rayg: An inventive young human, he is the son of Lada and Thane Hammar. He is eventually acquired by the dragons of the Lavadome and becomes a thrall of the Imperial Line. His expertise gains him great recognition from the Copper. It was he began construction on a bridge and invented the brace for the Copper's damaged wing, the Copper often comes to him for advice and promises to free him if he completes his bridge project. Despite the Copper's promises Rayg is never freed, usually because of his various unfinished projects. He is pragmatic and does not seem too troubled by his enslavement. In Dragon Fate, Rayg conspires with Imfamnia (later revealed to be possessed by the Red Queen of the Ghioz) to overthrow dragonkind. He breeds an army of supersoldiers by feeding dragonblood to the Demen Legion while also digging tunnels in the Lower World to allow their transport. He also breeds a host of trolls on dragonblood, controlling them through a crystal. This mutates them into scaled monsters with wings, which he augments by creating dragonblooded Griffaran guards, which sacrifice speed for size and power. To end all challenge to his plans, he destroys the Heavy Wing of the Aerial Host in an ambush, overcoming the most powerful force under the sun by ambushing them in their sleep with his trolls. Most of the Aerial Host is killed along with the Grand Commander of the Aerial Host. He is killed when he flees the siblings with Imfamnia, whose wings fail her, sending them plummeting to their deaths. * Imfamnia: the self-centered granddaughter of Tyr FeHazathant, and daughter of AgGriffopse and Ibidio. Though described as \\"a brainless piece of fluff\\", she schemes her way to power several times. As a drakka, she falsely accuses her friend NiVom of attacking her, to clear the way for SiDrakkon to become Tyr and mate her. During his short, unpopular reign, she gets him to name her half-brother SiMevolant as heir, and mates him as well, becoming queen a second time when SiDrakkon dies. Her scandalous affairs during this period earn her the title \\"the Jade Queen\\". After SiMevolant's downfall, she flees to Ghioz and takes NiVom as a mate. After the defeat of Ghioz, NiVom intercedes with the Copper and they become protectors of Ghioz province in the Grand Alliance, though at this time she is possessed by the Red Queen. Failing to seduce AuRon when he becomes protector of a neighboring province, she instead cultivates a false friendship with Natasatch, creates a superarmy using NiVom's blood, nearly succeeds in assassinating the Copper and Wistala in the baths, and orders a surprise attack that nearly succeeds in overthrowing dragonkind (see Rayg above). * Rhea (girl): One of the many thralls that belong to the Dragons of the Lavadome. She is never shown to speak in the stories and is assumed to be mute. She is married to Rayg and the two of them have children together. She is the only unbiased eyewitness to Halaflora's death. * Naf Touraq: A mysterious man from the east who has an enormous sense of humour. He becomes a commander in the military and later king of his own lands. He is perhaps the only human that AuRon truly trusts. * Hieba: A girl rescued by Naf and raised by AuRon for a year of her childhood. She grows up and falls in love with Naf, but is held captive by the Red Queen. On several occasions she is referenced by AuRon as a \\"loose woman\\". * Gobold/Fangbreaker: Dwarf of The Wheel of Fire, who eventually becomes their king after killing one of the previous rulers. Gobold had sought revenge upon AuRel and Irelia for (from his perspective) betraying him in a deal that resulted in the pair gaining their home cave. Gobold received the name Fangbreaker when he killed Irelia by smashing her jaws with his fist. He himself is betrayed from within the Wheel of Fire by Wistala in an act of vengeance. ===Other important characters=== In Dragon Champion * The Dawn Roarers: A pack of wolves that AuRon joins after devastating most of the members. They consist of the leader, Hard-Legs Black-Bristle, and members Bright-Sight Fey-Bark, Way-Nose High-Star, and Long-Tail Fire-Heart (AuRon). Their descendants go on to guard the Isle of Ice under AuRon's dominion and help keep his hatchlings entertained. * Djer: A tradesdwarf of the Chartered Company of the Diadem who frees AuRon of his slave collar and takes him to his company to offer a job. Thanks to the friendship and actions of AuRon, Djer becomes a partner of the Chartered Company. During a later battle Djer is burned badly by a dragon, his body charred inside and out. He suffers until AuRon finds Djer and ends his suffering. Djer is also seen by Wistala in chapter nine of \\"Dragon Avenger\\", where she decides not to kill him after seeing him leave his meal to go cold while he tends to an injured pony. Although he is not named, Wistala notices his oddly tall boots, a nod to his nickname \\"Djer Highboots\\". * NooMoahk: A decrepit but wise black dragon, many millennia old. In his final years he teaches AuRon wisdom and languages. In the writing he is shown to have a failing mind and little distinction between long term and short term memory, possibly due to the effects of prolonged exposure to a mysterious crystal he guards. He later dies fighting AuRon during one such lapse when AuRon is forced to trick NooMoahk into impaling himself on a monument dedicated to the elder dragon's late human friend Tindairus. It is possible that he is an ancestor of the siblings. AuRon is reverent of him to the point that he even takes a false-name similar to his when investigating the Isle of Ice and even names his one of sons after him. * Wrimere The Wyrmmaster:: An old wizard who is breeding dragons on the Isle of Ice to be obedient to their human masters; He does this to the purpose of waging a genocide on the elves and dwarves of the world. By manipulating hatchling dragons tendencies to imprint on the first thing they see, he raises dragons as war mounts and enslaves the females as a 'breeding stock'. He commits suicide after AuRon overthrows the dragon riders. In Dragon Avenger * Bartleghaff (condor): The leader of a large flock of mountain condors. He is AuRel's oldest friend, though his first appearance would lead you to think otherwise. Wistala meets him as he is waiting for AuRel to die, so he can give his flock the signal to begin feeding on the body. However, it seems this is what AuRel wished for his old friend to do. AuRel jokes about not wanting some stranger getting the best meat for themselves, and Bartleghaff laments that the feast his family would have off of AuRel's corpse would be remembered at every cliff-sit for the next century. * Rainfall: An elf who cares for Wistala after she narrowly escapes the Dragonblade. He is chivalrous and courteous, introducing Wistala to Hypatian traditions and fostering her interest in them. Rainfall plots with Wistala to stave off Thane Hammar's advances on his familial land, and to this end legally adopts Wistala as his daughter. He is killed by a vindictive Thane Hammar during the sacking of Mossbell * Yari-Tab (cat): A cat befriended by Wistala. * Avalanche (horse): Rainfall's horse, once belonged to Rainfall's son.

He has a bit of a negative attitude, but he proves to be smarter and a much harder worker than most horses. He is shot and killed by Barbarians while trying to protect Mossbell. * Lada: Rainfall's granddaughter and mother of Rayg. She is held captive by Thane Hammar as a part of his rivalry with Rainfall and develops Stockholm syndrome, believing that he loves her. Upon her return she is an impudent brat who resents Rainfall separating her from the Thane and competes with Wistala for Rainfall's affection. She eventually gains a measure of wisdom following a pregnancy and time in the circus. * Circus Members: A traveling circus consisting of various performers and handlers. Led by the elf Ragwrist who is kindly but tight-fisted and often bemoans the expenses of his circus. Notable members are Dsossa, an elf horse trainer, Intanta, a wizened old fortune teller and Brok, a dwarf in charge of the beasts of burden. Wistala and Lada become members for a brief time. * Dragons of the Sadda-Vale: Distant relatives of AuRon, Wistala and the Copper. They do not feel that dragons should concern themselves with anything outside of their own territory, even if it is the killing of another dragon family. The only one to show any sense among them in DharSii who stays there sparingly and leaves there hurriedly. In Dragon Outcast * The bats: A family of bats that assist The Copper in exchange for his blood, and his saving their lives. They accompany him to the Lavadome where they act as a spy and messenger force for him, and later the Lavadome. After a few generations of feeding almost entirely on dragons blood several bats become large and almost dragon-like, earning the nickname gargoyles. * Tyr FeHazathant: An old male dragon (deep red/purple) who is the ruler of the Lavadome dragons. He adopts the Copper into the Imperial family after the latter \\"saves\\" some griffaran eggs. The Copper sees him as an adoptive grandfather and is devoutly loyal to him.

The Tyr dies under unknown circumstances, naming the Copper as his heir to Tighlia before his death. * Tighlia: The old mate of Tyr FeHazathant. Wise but can be seen as calculating and cold-hearted. She has a low opinion of the Copper and forces him to marry her sickly granddaughter Halaflora. She dies at the hands of the Dragonblade * SiDrakkon: A deep red-purple male who is brother to Tighlia. Often bad-tempered but a capable military leader. Has an unhealthy obsession with the smell (and taste) of human thralls. Inherits the position of Tyr from his brother-in-law FeHazathant. Dies under suspicious circumstances. * SiMevolant: A gold, grandson of the Tyr. Lazy and apathetic, often described as an idiot by the rest of the Imperial Line.

Has a friendly rivalry with the Drakwatch. In Dragon Strike * The Red Queen of Ghioz: The ruler of Ghioz and commander of a powerful alliance of outlying forces. She frequently tells AuRon she \\"cannot be bothered\\" with dying, and though assassinated by Naf and later burned by Auron in the defeat of Ghioz, he suspects a mysterious blue light that leaves her dying body will allow her to continue. He finds and kills many other Red Queen bodies in a magical chamber below her mountain palace. Despite killing off her supply of bodies, the Red Queen lives long enough to possess Infamnia, and allies herself with Rayg to overthrow dragon kind. After being defeated by AuRon and Wistala, she and Rayg escape to continue the fight another day, the Red Queen loses control of her ability to fly, causing her and Rayg to fall to their deaths, ending their terror once and for all. * Ayafeeia: The leader of the Firemaidens. Her example of fierce protection of all dragon hatchlings so impresses Wistala that she joins the Firemaidens herself. She initially leads the small force holding the north passes of Hypatia against the Ironriders, but leaves Wistala in charge when RuGaard orders her to return. She joins Nilrasha's counterstrike, and helps retake Hypatia. * Takea: A fierce dragonelle of the Firemaids, killed in fighting in the northern passes. * HeBellereth: Leader of the Aerial Host, loyal to RuGaard, involved in retaking the Lavadome and the humbling of Ghioz. * LaDibar: A highly intelligent, but somewhat obstructionist dragon of the Lavadome. * Paskinix: The king and general of the Demen.

The episode follows series protagonists Phineas and Ferb building an extremely large roller coaster starting in their backyard and going throughout the city. \\"Rollercoaster\\" was written by co-creators Dan Povenmire and Jeff \\"Swampy\\" Marsh, the former of whom also directed the episode. The two used the episode to pitch the series to Disney. They recorded a set of storyboard reels, which Povenmire voiced over and sent them overseas. The preview of the episode totaled a combined 10.8 million viewers. In 2011, the episode was remade into a half-hour musical episode titled \\"Rollercoaster: The Musical!\\". ==Plot summary== Phineas (Vincent Martella) and his stepbrother Ferb (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) are sitting lazily under the big tree in their backyard when they decide to construct a large roller coaster. With their mother Linda (Caroline Rhea) at the grocery store, their sister Candace (Ashley Tisdale) wants to catch them in the act and \\"bust\\" them. Candace goes to the store to tell their Mom of the boys' activities, though she is keen on neglecting it. Isabella (Alyson Stoner) asks Candace at the Flynn-Fletcher house if Phineas and Ferb are home, but Candace ignores her. Isabella then goes to Phineas with hearts in her eyes and says her common catchphrase \\"Whatcha doin'?\\". She says \\"Isn't that impossible?\\" to Phineas and asks him to go swimming with her, but Phineas declines and Isabella leaves. Phineas and Ferb begin working on the coaster. Meanwhile, Perry the Platypus (Dee Bradley Baker) performs his act as a \\"secret Agent P\\", being informed by Major Francis Monogram (Jeff \\"Swampy\\" Marsh) that Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz (Dan Povenmire) has bought 80% of the Tri- State Area's tin foil. Perry darts off to investigate what Dr. Doofenshmirtz is doing. With their rollercoaster finally finished, Phineas and Ferb unveil it to the neighborhood children in a glamor-filled light show with notable guests being Isabella, Ginger, and Katie. They immediately climb up the lift hill as Phineas shows everyone how to fasten their seatbelts, he then drops it after showing everyone how to release the buckle on the seatbelt, he then sits back down as the ride crests the top of the hill. It then pauses, and Phineas double checks to make sure everyone signed the waivers, then the rollercoaster rockets down the first 3-mile drop and begins the wild ride. There are loops, twists, and turns. After that, the rollercoaster flips through the corkscrew around the interstate, and rubber snakes dump on everyone as they are screaming at the top of their lungs until Phineas says ‚ÄúRelax! They're Just Rubber!‚Äù, The rollercoaster then dives into a mud bucket before immersing back out and going through a carwash. The rollercoaster then comes to a complete stop as everyone is now squeaky clean, an attendant rubs the nose of the front car and waves goodbye. The rollercoaster then zooms away, takes a quick trip through the \\"AH-AH-AH-AH!\\" section, and turns through several loops around Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated. Doofenshmirtz, meanwhile, reveals that he is using the tin foil to cover the eastern seaboard, then using a magnet to pull it, thereby reversing the Earth's rotation. Perry fights him, but Doofenshmirtz manages to get the magnet activating. However, Doofenshmirtz soon learns that his plan is flawed because the magnet has only taken the tin foil off the eastern seaboard, forming it into a 2-ton giant ball. Seeing that it's heading forward, Doofenshmirtz decides to separate the magnet from his machine to stop it, and Perry is forced to help him out. Perry attempts to solve the problem by hooking the magnet to a helicopter, causing the magnet to go with it. Doofenshmirtz is happy about being saved, but is then crushed (along with the rest of the tallest part of the building) by the tin foil ball that crashes into it. The magnet attracts the Magnetism Magnifier, which sends a magnetic ray at the track under it, picking up the entire rollercoaster. Agent P, who has been riding on top of the magnet and notices that the helicopter has been trailing a plume of smoke from the strain of lifting that much weight. He cuts the cable, making the rollercoaster drop to the ground. The kids are still on the very fast rollercoaster and have just entered the wildest sections of the ride. Agent P jumps onto the coaster with the kids as it passed beneath him. Phineas looks behind him and utters the famous catch phrase, \\"Oh, there you are, Perry.\\" Instead of seeing Agent P, Phineas sees Perry again, since Agent P put his hat on Isabella a moment before, so he wouldn't be recognized. The rollercoaster reaches the broken end of the track and ride out into the street, through a construction site and up onto the tail of a passing jumbo jet after a crane swings them up into the air. The rollercoaster cars finally come loose from the tail of the jet and they fall onto the Statue of Liberty. It bends and then flings them over to Mount Rushmore, where they do some loops inside Theodore Roosevelt's glasses. The rollercoaster cars then shoot out on a tree over a Mr. Slushy Burger, then get flung to Paris where they land on a very bendable Eiffel Tower over a croissant stand, finally getting flung all the way into outer space. A satellite passes by the coaster, and Phineas points out that if it falls to Earth, Candace is in charge. At that moment, the coaster plummets to the Earth, picking up speed and catching the nose of the first coaster car on fire from the friction of re-entry. As they get closer to Danville, Phineas says, \\"We should've charged more.\\" Candace continues to try and bust them, even on the way home. The magnet is stopped, as Phineas and Ferb return home, Candace a second too late. Isabella says that was the best ride ever and she and Phineas talk about Perry and that he may lay an egg. Ferb burps from having peanut butter, which Isabella says was cool, and she leaves at that point. The episode ends with the roller coaster exploding in the boys' backyard tree and tin foil ball is seen rolling in the background setting. Upon the rollercoaster exploding Candace tries to bust the boys again. Mom responds by saying, \\"Give it a rest, Candace!\\" ==ProductionConception=== An original storyboard panel from the pitch reel sent to overseas executives for Disney. Series co-creator Dan Povenmire attributed the genesis for the show to his childhood in Mobile, Alabama. Povenmire recalled that his mother told him \\"never to waste a day of summer\\". Meanwhile, the show's other co-creator, Jeff \\"Swampy\\" Marsh grew up in a large, blended family. Similar to Povenmire, Marsh spent his summers exploring and taking part in several different activities in order to have fun. The two met while working as layout artists on The Simpsons in the 1990s. Povenmire commented that \\"We were always laughing at the same jokes\\". The two became a writing team on the Nickelodeon animated series Rocko's Modern Life. They began working on Phineas and Ferb around 1992, while still working together at Nickelodeon. The two had become friends due to their mutual tastes and interests. Citing their childhood, they wanted to incorporate summer vacations, a time when the two would go out and do something constructive. They spent sixteen years pitching it to four different networks, including Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, all of which kept shooting it down due to its complexity. When Povenmire landed a pitch with Disney, despite being unsure at first, the series was accepted. Povenmire and Marsh both wrote \\"Rollercoaster\\", and used it as the pitch for the entire series. Unlike normal series, they did not send a script to the overseas Disney executives, but set up a storyboard and mixed it over with dialogue by Povenmire, then set up a \\"play-by-play\\" and recorded it. The series was accepted after 16 years of development and the episode was produced. Several lines and scenes from the storyboard were removed or altered in the eventual production of the episode. Several such scenes were eventually used in later episodes, such as a scene later used in the episode \\"Gaming the System\\", in which Doofenshmirtz waits a few seconds, until precisely 11:00, before initiating his plan. Povenmire and Marsh wanted to include two things in every episode; a song, and an action or chase scene. However, the song in every episode did not begin until \\"Flop Starz\\", the next episode. ===Casting=== Vincent Martella, Thomas Sangster, and Ashley Tisdale, who voice Phineas, Ferb, and Candace respectively, were all hired by the casting department because of their popularity within the target age-group and general belief in their ability to perform their roles. Another character, Jeremy, who is usually voiced by Mitchel Musso, briefly appeared in the episode in a different voice than usual from an unknown voice extra. Aired in Norway and the UK only The end credits of the episode list several extras who possibly voiced him, including Dee Bradley Baker, Raviv Ullman, and the co-creators. The episode used live action briefly in the shot in which the kids fall to Earth, a technique featured in two other episodes to date: Out to Launch and The Chronicles of Meap. ==Broadcast== The episode originally aired as a preview after the premiere of High School Musical 2 on August 17, 2007, with a rating of TV-Y7. Disney Channel wanted to start off the series in a special way, though they did not to use \\"Rollercoaster\\"; instead, they chose the episode \\"Flop Starz\\", and aired it in a worldwide premiere. ===Reception=== When originally aired on August 17, 2007, \\"Rollercoaster\\" peaked high ratings in several categories. The preview garnered a recorded amount of 10.8 million viewers. 4.15 million were in the demographic of kids 6‚Äì11, while 4.20 million were in their teens 9‚Äì14 category. These high ratings lead to the episode being the second highest-rated telecast Disney Channel received in its recorded history. ==Related episodes== The events of \\"Rollercoaster\\" would be revisited in the season 2 episode \\"Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo\\", which sees a future adult version of Candace returning to the events of the episode in a time machine to help her present counterpart successfully bust Phineas and Ferb for the rollercoaster. However, this action led to a chain reaction that soon followed, turning the future version of Danville into a dystopian society led by subplot antagonist Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz. Later, the same Candace goes back into the past to stop the adult Candace from causing the disaster. Inspired by the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"Trials and Tribble-ations\\" (which saw the crew of the newer series interacting with the events of the original series episode \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\"), the use of \\"Rollercoaster\\" within the plot was viewed by Marsh as \\"a great way to interweave a story.\\" ===Musical remake=== A remake of the episode, titled \\"Rollercoaster: The Musical!\\", aired on January 28, 2011 on Disney Channel and on Disney Channel on Demand on Verizon on January 21, 2011. The episode features the original storyline, except it is put into a musical setting. The episode included many Easter eggs from previous episodes, and references to other productions. When Candace and her mother leave the supermarket and are walking from the parking lot, the two future Candaces can be seen behind a car. Also, while the roller coaster is flung into space, Meap can be seen in his spaceship. For the finale of the episode, the cast of the show performed \\"Carpe Diem\\" and almost every major and minor character from previous episodes of the show made cameos in the performance, including the Goozim from the episode \\"Got Game?\\". Kenny Ortega made a special cameo as the choreographer of the performance. Various phrases from the original episode were made into songs with two songs added in the episode, including: *\\"Hey Ferb\\" (Phineas) *\\"You're Going Down\\" (Candace) *\\"What 'Cha Doin'?\\" (Isabella) *\\"Monogram Box Song\\" (Major Monogram) *\\"Mom Look\\" (Candace) *\\"Aren't You a Little Young?\\" (Phineas and the Delivery Man) *\\"Back in Gimmelshtump\\" (Dr. Doofenshmirtz) *\\"Rollercoaster\\" (Phineas) *\\"Carpe Diem\\" (Phineas) ==Footnotes== :1. Original broadcasts and the sneak peek of the episode have the song in the end credits. Other airings, however, include the song at the end of \\"Lawn Gnome Beach Party of Terror!\\" instead whilst others have Major Monogram singing: 'My Whole World is a Screen'. ==References*Official Phineas and Ferb website Category:Phineas and Ferb episodes Category:2007 American television episodes Category:American television pilots ","title":"Rollercoaster (Phineas and Ferb)"},{"id":"19295936","text":"Ellis Worth (c. 1587 - 1659), or Woorth, was a noted English actor in the Jacobean and Caroline eras. He was a leading member of two important companies, Queen Anne's Men and Prince Charles's Men.Edwin Nunzeger, A Dictionary of Actors and of Others Associated with the Representation of Plays in England Before 1642, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1929; pp. 401-2. ==Biography== Nothing is known of Worth's origins or early life, or the start of his career; he was with the Queen Anne's company by 1615, and continued with the troupe until it dissolved in 1623. The paucity of the extant historical record means that little is known of the roles he played; he was most likely the \\"Ellis\\" who played a Lord in Robert Daborne's The Poor Man's Comfort around 1617. After 1623, Worth was a member of what is usually called the Company of the Revels at the Red Bull Theatre, and sometimes simply the Red Bull company; little is known of their activities. When Richard Gunnell built his Salisbury Court Theatre in 1629, he needed a company to act there. He brought in the new or second version of Prince Charles's Men. Worth was an original member and a \\"sharer\\" (partner) in this organization from 1631 to at least 1638, and probably until the theatres were closed in 1642 at the start of the English Civil War. He played Ardelio in the troupe's December 1631 production of Marmion's Holland's Leaguer. Much of what is known of Worth's career comes from legal documents that pertain to the various controversies in which his companies were involved. The long legal battle between Susan Baskervile and Queen Anne's Men is one obvious example; that lawsuit is often known as the Worth/Baskervile suit, or Worth v. Baskervile, since Worth, due to his leading position in the troupe, was listed first among the roster of actors Baskervile sued.C. J. Sisson, \\"The Red Bull Company and the Importunate Widow,\\" Shakespeare Survey, Vol. 7 (1954); Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2002; pp. 57-68. [See: Susan Baskervile.] Worth also testified in the Keep the Widow Waking suit in 1624 (though he testified that he had nothing to do with the play). The second Prince Charles's company also had a tempestuous and litigious career, and Worth was deeply enmeshed in its controversies. Worth and Andrew Cane, the troupe's leaders, were sued by fellow actor William Bankes in 1635.G. E. Bentley, \\"The Troubles of a Caroline Acting Troupe: Prince Charles's Company,\\" Huntington Library Quarterly, Vol. 41 No. 3 (May, 1978), pp. 217-49. Bankes invested ¬£100 to become an actor/sharer in the company, but was unhappy with the results. Even after the theatres were closed, the litigation continued; Worth gave a deposition in a Chancery suit in February 1654, in which, coincidentally, he identifies himself as \\"of the age of 67 or thereabouts.\\"Bentley, \\"Troubles,\\" p. 220 n. 4; Sisson, pp. 59, 67. Worth's daughter Jane was christened in July 1613. The girl's mother died sometime before 1626, when Worth married the widow of Thomas Holcombe. Their son Elizeus was christened in March 1629.G E. Bentley, \\"Records of Players in the Parish of St. Giles, Cripplegate,\\" Papers of the Modern Language Association, Vol. 44 No. 3 (September 1929), pp. 789-826; see pp. 825-6. For a couple of centuries, nothing was known about Worth's later years; even the year of his death was mysterious. The discovery of his last will and testament provided some valuable data on his family and surviving descendants.S. P. Cerasano, \\"New Renaissance Players' Wills,\\" Modern Philology, Vol. 82 No. 3 (February 1985), pp. 299-304. Regrettably, the will contains no mention of actors; Worth's colleagues had largely passed from the scene by 1659. ==References== Category:17th-century English male actors Category:English male stage actors Category:1659 deaths Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Ellis Worth"},{"id":"19295937","text":"Frank Osborne Cameron (17 April 1892 ‚Äì 6 February 1986) was an Australian rules footballer who played with University in the Victorian Football League. ==Sources== *Holmesby, Russell & Main, Jim (2007).

Indianapolis was founded on the White River under an incorrect assumption that it would serve as a major transportation artery, but the river proved difficult to navigate and too shallow during much of the year.Baer, p. 11, and Hyman, p. 34. After the steamboat Robert Hanna ran aground along the river in 1831, no steamboat successfully returned to Indianapolis. Flatboats continued to transport goods along a portion of the river until new dams impeded their ability to navigate its waters.Brown, p. 20, and The first major federally funded highway in the U.S., the National Road, reached Indianapolis in 1836, followed by the railroad in 1847. By 1850, eight railroads converged in the city, ending its isolation from the rest of the country and ushering in a new era of growth.Bodenhamer and Barrows, p. 1480; Brown, pp. 34 and 52‚Äì53; Hale, p. 21; and Indianapolis, A Walk Through Time, p. 13. Indianapolis Union Station opened in the Wholesale District on September 20, 1853 as the world's first union station. Citizen's Street and Railway Company was established in 1864, operating the city's first mule-drawn streetcar line.Brown, p. 50.Sulgrove, pp. 134, 424‚Äì26. By 1890, electric-powered streetcars began running.Hale, p. 54. Opened in 1904, the Indianapolis Traction Terminal was the largest interurban station in the world, handling 500 trains daily and 7 million passengers annually. Ultimately doomed by the automobile, the terminal closed in 1941, followed by the streetcar system in 1957. Indianapolis was home to the first electric carsharing service in the U.S., Bollor√© Bluecar's BlueIndy. Operations launched in September 2015 and ceased in May 2020. At the height of service, BlueIndy provided 200 electric cars and 92 charging stations throughout the city. ==Air transportIndianapolis International Airport=== Col. H. Weir Cook Terminal shortly before opening in 2008. Indianapolis International Airport, identified as IND, is the largest airport in Indiana and serves the Indianapolis Metropolitan Area. A new midfield terminal was built in 2008, with 40 gates and two concourses. There are also future plans for a third parallel runway south of I-70. ===Other area air transport facilities=== * Eagle Creek Airpark * Indianapolis Downtown Heliport * Indianapolis Regional Airport * Indianapolis Metropolitan Airport ===Cargo operations=== FedEx Express, a cargo airline, operates its national hub out of IND and is its second largest hub behind only its Superhub in Memphis. FedEx has continued expanding the hub along Interstate 70, which has created additional ramp space for more wide-body aircraft and facilitated more direct flights between IND to FedEx hubs in Europe and Asia. Cargolux, which flies to Chicago O'Hare, Los Angeles, and Luxembourg, also operates out of IND. ==HighwaysInterstate highways=== Several interstates serve the Indianapolis area: *25px Interstate 65 routes north to the Chicago area and runs south to Louisville. *25px Interstate 69 routes north to Fort Wayne, and ends at the I-465 Beltway. Future interstate plans include extending I-69 southwest to Bloomington and Evansville, continuing through Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana through Texas to the Mexico border. *25px Interstate 70 with transportation to St. Louis and Columbus. *25px Interstate 74 to Cincinnati and Danville. *31px Interstate 465 serves as a beltway routing around the city and connects to all of the interstate highways. *31px Interstate 865 serves as connector to I-65 to I-465, on the northwest side of Indianapolis. ===U.S. highways=== *25px US 31 *25px US 36 *25px US 40 *25px US 52 *28px US 136 *28px US 421 ===State roads=== *25px State Road 37 *25px State Road 67 *25px State Road 134 *25px State Road 135 Among urbanized areas with 1,000,000 population or greater in the United States, Indianapolis ranked tenth in freeway lane miles per 1,000 population and eighth in freeway-equivalent miles per 1,000 population, according to 1999 data. ==Mass transit== Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in 1907. The Indianapolis Public Transportation Corporation, known locally as IndyGo, provides public transportation for the city. IndyGo was established in 1975 after the city of Indianapolis took over privately owned Indianapolis Transit Systems, Inc. Prior to 1997, IndyGo was called Metro. Central Indiana Commuter Services (CICS), funded by IndyGo to reduce pollution, serves Indianapolis and surrounding counties. Historically, Indianapolis had an extensive network of streetcar routes. In 1953, the last streetcars ran in the city. Trolleybuses made their last run in the city four years later in 1957, leaving the city with an all-bus transit system. The Downtown Indianapolis Streetcar Corp., a not-for-profit organization, is investigating the feasibility of a streetcar line to serve various downtown destinations. A report prepared by Purdue University indicated that buses running on a fuel containing 10 percent biodiesel are likely to help Indianapolis mass transit reduce pollution without compromising fuel economy. The report also suggests introducing more hybrid diesel-electric buses and a fuel containing 20 percent biodiesel (BD20) would further reduce emissions and petroleum consumption. IndyGo's Red Line is a bus rapid transit line running from Broad Ripple Village on the north side to the University of Indianapolis on the south side. Construction started in May 2018 and the line opened for service on September 1, 2019, using all electric buses. It is part of a larger plan known as the Marion County Transit plan. ==People mover== The Indiana University Health People Mover in 2007. The Indiana University Health People Mover formerly linked the Indiana University School of Medicine with the medical centers of University Hospital, Riley Hospital for Children, Methodist Hospital, and related facilities on the campus of Indiana University ‚Äì Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). It was shut down in February 2019. The people mover was sometimes inaccurately described as a monorail, but in fact rode on dual concrete beams with the guideway as wide as the vehicle. ==Intercity transportation== Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Indianapolis at the Indianapolis Union Station. Amtrak provides the tri-weekly service of the Cardinal to Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. The Hoosier State provided service to Chicago on days the Cardinal does not operate. That service stopped on June 30, 2019, because funding for the service was not included in the state‚Äôs 2019‚Äì2020 budget. Greyhound Lines operates a bus terminal at Union Station downtown and at Indianapolis International Airport's Ground Transportation Center. Megabus also runs from downtown Indianapolis, stopping on North Alabama Street adjacent to the Indianapolis City Market. ==References== Indianapolis, Indiana ","title":"Transportation in Indianapolis"},{"id":"19296058","text":"Henry Cordner (17 June 1885 ‚Äì 14 November 1943) was an Australian rules footballer who played with both the Melbourne Football Club and the Melbourne University Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL). == Family == The son of Edward James Cordner, and Helen Cordner, n√©e Rae, Henry Cordner was born in Bendigo on 17 June 1885.Birth: Cordner, The Bendigo Advertiser, (Thursday, 18 June 1885), p.2.

In 1997, it was placed in its own, monotypic family, Acanthomeridiidae. It is known from eight specimens, all found in China. == Morphology == Acanthomeridion was a 35 mm-long animal, with 11 segments ending in rear-facing spines. The head features free cheeks separated from the rest of the head by sutures. This is analogous with trilobites. Otherwise, affinities are mainly unclear. More recently discovered specimens of the species Acanthomeridion anacanthus have paired gut diverticula as have been seen in artiopods. No fossils exposing the limbs have yet been found, but they are thought to be biramous with the upper section of the limb holding the gills. As limbs have not been found, it is uncertain whether Acanthomeridion was a seafloor-dweller or a swimmer. The streamlining suggests that it swam, but is inconclusive. == Taxonomy == Acanthomeridion is considered a primitive member of Artiopoda. Some studies have put it as having affinities with petalopleurans or xandarellids, but a more recent study by Hou, Williams et al. including the more recently discovered specimens suggest that it is the most basal member of the clade. ==References== Category:Maotianshan shales fossils Category:Prehistoric arthropod genera Category:Monotypic arthropod genera Category:Arthropod incertae sedis ","title":"Acanthomeridion"},{"id":"19296109","text":"Actaeus is a Cambrian organism with a resemblance to the great appendage arthropods.

The name of the tumour comes from the similarity (under the microscope) between the small cells of the tumour and secondary spermatocytes. ==Signs and symptoms== Spermatocytic tumor is a rare tumour, making up only one to two percent of all testicular germ cell tumours. Men presenting with this tumour are generally 50 to 60 years old, and its occurrence is rare in men under 30 years old. Most present with slow, painless testicular enlargement, which may involve both testes. ==Diagnosis== Spermatocytic tumors are diagnosed based on tissue from orchiectomy (or partial orchiectomy), done for a lesion suspicious for cancer on medical imaging. The macroscopic appearance of the tumour is of a mutinodular grey-white to tan coloured mass with gelatinous, haemorrhagic and necrotic areas. The tumour may extend beyond the testis. ===Histologic appearance=== Histologically, spermatocytic tumors consist of three cell populations: *small cells with a large nuclear-to- cytoplasmic ratio (6-8 ¬µm), *medium-sized cells with prominent nucleoli (15-18 ¬µm) and, *large cells (50-100 ¬µm). The cells are generally packed into nodules, and have a loose, sheet-like arrangement that is commonly interrupted by interstitial oedema. Unlike classical seminoma, fibrous septation and lymphocytic infiltrates are not seen. Cells undergoing mitosis are common, as are cells undergoing apoptosis. Intratubular growth of spermatocytic tumor can be seen, however there is no intratubular germ cell neoplasia of unspecified type (IGCNU). The intratubular growth probably accounts for the appearance of separate tumour nodules within the testis. Immunostaining for most of the usual testicular germ cell tumour markers is negative (i.e. placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), vimentin, actin, desmin, alpha fetoprotein (AFP), OCT4, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)). Rarely, spermatocytic tumors may show sarcomatoid differentiation, most commonly as undifferentiated spindled cells intermingled within the typical- appearing spermatocytic tumor cells. Rhabdomyosarcomatous differention has also been described. Image:Spermatocytic seminoma intermed mag.jpgMicrograph of a spermatocytic tumor. H&E; stain. ===Relation to seminoma=== Spermatocytic tumor is not considered a subtype of seminoma and, unlike seminoma and most other germ cell tumours, it does not arise from intratubular germ cell neoplasia. It has not been described as arising in locations outside the testis, and does not occur in association with other germ cell tumours.Mills, S (ed.) 2009.Sternberg's Diagnostic Pathology. 5th Edition. ==Treatment== Unlike classical seminoma, spermatocytic tumors rarely metastasise, so radical orchidectomy alone is sufficient treatment, and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy are generally not required. ==References External links == * Spermatocytic seminoma micrograph - webpathology.com.

The raid was the culmination of an investigation that began in Arizona, where a package containing of marijuana was intercepted in a warehouse, addressed to the mayor's residence. Instead of confiscating the package, police allowed it to be delivered. Upon arrival, a SWAT team raided the house and held Calvo and his mother-in-law at gunpoint, and shot and killed his two dogs, one as it attempted to run away. The event gained national and international media attention. While the Calvos were cleared of wrongdoing, the police were accused by the Calvo family and civil rights groups of lacking a proper search warrant, using excessive force, and failure to conduct a proper background investigation of the home being raided--the investigation was so cursory that the sheriff's office was unaware that Calvo was the mayor. Despite the criticisms, no action has been taken against the officers or their respective police departments. In August 2010, Sheriff Michael A. Jackson stated that: \\"We've apologized for the incident, but we will never apologize for taking drugs off our streets. Quite frankly, we'd do it again. Tonight.\\" ==Raid== On July 29, 2008, a SWAT team from the Sheriff's Office, agents of the State of Maryland, executing a search warrant and assisting the separate County Police, conducted a raid on the home of Berwyn Heights Mayor Cheye Calvo. The raid was initiated after the Mayor brought a package delivered by the SWAT team into his home. A drug-sniffing dog in Arizona had determined that the package‚Äîaddressed to the Mayor's wife‚Äîcontained of marijuana. While taking control of the residence, Sheriff's deputies shot Calvo's two pet Labrador retrievers, including one who was cited by Calvo to be running away from officers. Calvo and his mother-in-law were handcuffed and questioned for several hours, with Calvo wearing just underwear. ==Response of law enforcement agencies== The incident received wide coverage in the United States and abroad. Immediately following the raid, both the Sheriff's Office and County Police stated that the Berwyn Heights raid was proper because of the large quantity of drugs involved. On August 7, 2008, Mayor Calvo called for a federal investigation of the incident by the U.S. Department of Justice. The local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) also requested an investigation. In early August, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began a civil rights investigation into the incident. On August 8, 2008, the County Police cleared the Calvos of any wrongdoing relating to the drug shipment. Chief of Police Melvin High called the Calvos \\"innocent victims\\" who were caught up in the drug trafficking ring. While High said he regretted the loss of the Calvo's dogs, he did not apologize for the actions taken by his officers. In a press conference on the same day as High's exoneration, Sheriff Michael A. Jackson defended the conduct of the deputies who conducted the raid. However, an internal investigation was launched as with any incident involving the discharge of a deputy's weapon. The results of the investigation, released on September 4, 2008, concluded the conduct of the deputies was appropriate and no wrongdoing was committed. According to the report, the first dog was shot after \\"engaging an officer\\" and the second was seen \\"running towards a second officer\\" and shot as well. As of December 2008, the county police has indicated their investigation is not complete. The FBI is still monitoring the situation. In August 2010 while campaigning to be elected county executive, Sheriff Jackson stated, \\"We've apologized for the incident, but we will never apologize for taking drugs off our streets....Quite frankly, we'd do it again. Tonight.\\" ==Criticism of police actionsImproper search warrant=== During the interrogation, Calvo repeatedly requested to see the search warrant, but his lawyer stated no copy was provided until three days later. A County Police spokesman initially stated that a no-knock warrant had been issued for Calvo's home. However, after Calvo's lawyer challenged that statement and media published copies of the warrant, the commander of the county's narcotics enforcement division stated that no-knock warrants do not exist in the county. However, no-knock warrants were clarified in a 2005 law, sponsored by Baltimore Delegate Curt Anderson, that limits their use to suspects fleeing into a house, or if a suspect is considered armed or is attempting to destroy evidence. ===Lack of a background investigation=== During interrogation, Calvo stated that officers did not believe he was the Mayor and for a time refused his request that they contact the Berwyn Heights Police Department (which was unaware of the raid) to confirm his identity. Police Chief High stated his department did not know the home was owned by the mayor and his wife. Patrick Murphy, chief of police for the Berwyn Heights Police Department, was especially critical of the county police. Murphy argued that the raid could have been prevented if his department had handled the situation, stating \\"you can't tell me the chief of police of a municipality wouldn't have been able to knock on the door of the mayor of that municipality, gain his confidence and enter the residence\\". Furthermore, according to Mayor Calvo, a memorandum of understanding between the county and the city requires county police to inform the city if an operation is being conducted within their jurisdiction. ===Use of excessive force=== In an editorial a week after the shooting, The Washington Post criticized the actions of police officers as \\"a Keystone Cops operation from start to finish\\", alluding to the lack of proper execution by the sheriff's office's SWAT team. Additionally, groups such as the Cato Institute were critical of the operation and used it as an example of the dangers of the War on Drugs and the militarization of local police departments in the United States. Marc Fisher of the Post also related this incident to the growing prevalence of SWAT units, even in small jurisdictions, noting a massive increase in the amount of SWAT deployments since the mid-1980s. Further criticism was leveled against the sheriff's office's deputies for the shooting of Calvo's two dogs. Contrary to the official internal investigations conducted by the sheriff's office and the county, Calvo stated his dogs were not a threat to the deputies. To support his claims, Calvo paid for a necropsy to be conducted on each dog by the Maryland Department of Agriculture. According to the results, one dog was shot four times, including twice in the head and chest. The other dog was shot twice, including once in the back of the leg which bolsters Calvo's argument that the dog was fleeing and that the force used was \\"unbelievably excessive\\". This version of events was also confirmed by the later testimony of a law enforcement officer present at the raid. ==AftermathLater arrests=== Prince George's County Police later arrested two men in a drug trafficking plan involving the shipment of large parcels of marijuana to addresses of uninvolved residents. After each parcel was delivered outside the addressee's home, another individual would retrieve the drugs. Police seized six packages containing of marijuana. ===Internal investigation=== On June 19, 2009, the Prince George's County Sheriff's Office issued a report of an internal investigation that cleared its deputies of any wrongdoing in the Berwyn Heights raid. Prince George's County Sheriff Michael Jackson said during a press conference that the findings of the report \\"are consistent with what I've felt all along: My deputies did their job to the fullest extent of their abilities....In the sense that we kept these drugs from reaching our streets, this operation was a success.\\" Jackson's explanation did not address the fact that the package was intercepted in the FedEx warehouse and delivered under police supervision. During the press conference, Jackson gave the first apology for the raid by a county official. \\"I am sorry for the impact this has had on Mayor Calvo, Ms. Tomsic and Ms. Porter and for the loss of their family pets,\\" Jackson said. \\"It is extremely unfortunate that a felonious drug trafficker involved this family in his criminal enterprise.\\" In response to the report, Cheye Calvo issued the following statement: \\"By commending his deputies for their actions, the Sheriff is placing other innocent families and innocent family pets at risk. There is no excuse for the no-knock entry into our home, the killing of Payton and Chase, and the prolonged handcuffing of my mother-in-law and myself.\\" ===Lawsuit=== A lawsuit was filed in June 2009 against Prince George's County Sheriff Michael Jackson; Detective Shawn Scarlata; the state of Maryland; Prince George's County; and two \\"John Doe\\" deputy sheriffs, whose names were not immediately released. In depositions, law enforcement personnel admitted that at least one of the dogs was running away when shot. In January 2011, the suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount of money and various SWAT reforms. ===Legislation=== In 2009, Mayor Cheye Calvo proposed a measure that would require every Maryland police department that operates a SWAT team to submit biannual reports on its activities, including where and when it was deployed and whether an operation resulted in arrests, evidence seizures, or injuries. The bill passed that same year, despite strong opposition from Maryland's police agencies. Maryland was the first state to adopt such legislation; Utah became the second when it passed a similar bill in March 2014. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:Animal cruelty incidents Category:Berwyn Heights, Maryland Category:Cannabis in Maryland Category:Crimes in Maryland Category:Drug raids Category:History of drug control Category:No-knock warrant Category:Police brutality in the United States Category:Prince George's County, Maryland ","title":"Berwyn Heights, Maryland mayor's residence drug raid"},{"id":"19296194","text":"Melrose High School is a public high school located in Memphis, Tennessee, in the Orange Mound area, serving 1557 students in grades 9‚Äì12.

Its body was divided into three sections. The anterior section had five equally sized pairs of appendages with two setal rows along the margins. The middle section was elongate and five times longer than the anterior or posterior. The posterior section was pear-shaped and had three rows of hooks surrounding the anus. ==Classification== Facivermis was considered by its describers to be a polychaete worm. An affinity to the unusual crustacean lineage Pentastomida has also been proposed, but is seen as unlikely. Since its discovery, however, most evidence has supported its being a lobopodian. Liu et al. draw a comparison to the known lobopodian Miraluolishania. Liu et al. also note that the pear-shaped end bears a close resemblance to the proboscis of priapulid worms if it is interpreted as being the anterior end. The possible priapulid \\"Xishania\\" longiusula's fragmentary remains closely resembles the pear-shaped end of Facivermis, so Huang et al. assigned \\"X\\". longiusula to Facivermis as a second species. In 2020, new specimens of the organism were found with a preserved tube, showing that it was a sessile tube worm like lobopodian belonging to Luolishaniidae, with a bulbous posterior. ==Ecology== Facivermis was previously interpreted as a predator that anchored itself into sediment with its hooked posterior end and used its anterior appendages to catch prey. One fossil has a possible bradoriid preserved in its gut. The new specimens suggest a lifestyle similar to feather duster worms, with the anterior hooks used to anchor itself into sediment. ==References== Category:Cambrian life Category:Lobopodia ","title":"Facivermis"},{"id":"19296206","text":"High Hopes is the third EP by Australian metalcore band the Amity Affliction.

The conjecture was posed by Hanna Neumann in 1957.Hanna Neumann. On the intersection of finitely generated free groups. Addendum. Publicationes Mathematicae Debrecen, vol. 5 (1957), p. 128 In 2011, a strengthened version of the conjecture (see below) was proved independently by Joel FriedmanJoel Friedman, \\"Sheaves on Graphs, Their Homological Invariants, and a Proof of the Hanna Neumann Conjecture\\" American Mathematical Soc., 2014 and by Igor Mineyev.Igor Minevev, \\"Submultiplicativity and the Hanna Neumann Conjecture.\\" Ann. of Math., 175 (2012), no. 1, 393-414. In 2017, a third proof of the Strengthened Hanna Neumann conjecture, based on homological arguments inspired by pro-p-group considerations, was published by Andrei Jaikin-Zapirain. Andrei Jaikin-Zapirain, Approximation by subgroups of finite index and the Hanna Neumann conjecture, Duke Mathematical Journal, 166 (2017), no. 10, pp. 1955-1987 ==History== The subject of the conjecture was originally motivated by a 1954 theorem of HowsonA. G. Howson. On the intersection of finitely generated free groups. Journal of the London Mathematical Society, vol. 29 (1954), pp. 428-434 who proved that the intersection of any two finitely generated subgroups of a free group is always finitely generated, that is, has finite rank. In this paper Howson proved that if H and K are subgroups of a free group F(X) of finite ranks n ‚â• 1 and m ‚â• 1 then the rank s of H ‚à© K satisfies: :s ‚àí 1 ‚â§ 2mn ‚àí m ‚àí n. In a 1956 paperHanna Neumann. On the intersection of finitely generated free groups. Publicationes Mathematicae Debrecen, vol. 4 (1956), 186-189. Hanna Neumann improved this bound by showing that : :s ‚àí 1 ‚â§ 2mn ‚àí 2m ‚àí n. In a 1957 addendum, Hanna Neumann further improved this bound to show that under the above assumptions :s ‚àí 1 ‚â§ 2(m ‚àí 1)(n ‚àí 1). She also conjectured that the factor of 2 in the above inequality is not necessary and that one always has :s ‚àí 1 ‚â§ (m ‚àí 1)(n ‚àí 1). This statement became known as the Hanna Neumann conjecture. ==Formal statement== Let H, K ‚â§ F(X) be two nontrivial finitely generated subgroups of a free group F(X) and let L = H ‚à© K be the intersection of H and K. The conjecture says that in this case :rank(L) ‚àí 1 ‚â§ (rank(H) ‚àí 1)(rank(K) ‚àí 1). Here for a group G the quantity rank(G) is the rank of G, that is, the smallest size of a generating set for G. Every subgroup of a free group is known to be free itself and the rank of a free group is equal to the size of any free basis of that free group. ==Strengthened Hanna Neumann conjecture== If H, K ‚â§ G are two subgroups of a group G and if a, b ‚àà G define the same double coset HaK = HbK then the subgroups H ‚à© aKa‚àí1 and H ‚à© bKb‚àí1 are conjugate in G and thus have the same rank. It is known that if H, K ‚â§ F(X) are finitely generated subgroups of a finitely generated free group F(X) then there exist at most finitely many double coset classes HaK in F(X) such that H ‚à© aKa‚àí1 ‚â† {1}. Suppose that at least one such double coset exists and let a1,...,an be all the distinct representatives of such double cosets.

Built in 1901, it is a Mission Revival structure featuring covered terraces and a covered porch with a three-story bell tower at the southeast corner. The building was listed as Ventura Historic Landmark No. 19 in 1976 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. After being operated as a hospital for nearly 30 years, the building was sold to the County of Ventura in 1932. It was used by the County for 44 years as offices for county officials and as a detention facility. In 1982, after being sold to a private investment group, the building was extensively renovated. The building was substantially expanded at the rear of the property, but the historic front and side facades were preserved. ==Planning and construction== Cephas Bard, c. 1901 In 1900, Dr. Cephas L. Bard, with backing from his brother Thomas R. Bard, purchased for $3,000 a quarter of a block at the corner of Fir and Poli streets in Ventura. The land was acquired for the purpose of building a large hospital in memory of their mother, Elizabeth Bard. Cephas Bard had been practicing medicine in Ventura since 1868 and was the first president of the Ventura County Medical Association and a past president of the California State Medical Society. Thomas Bard was one of the founders of Unocal Corporation who also served as a U.S. Senator from 1900 to 1905. Construction of the hospital continued throughout 1901. Dr. Bard traveled to the east in June 1901 to acquire furniture and equipment for the hospital. The hospital opened in January 1902. Dr. Bard became seriously ill in February 1902 and died at the new hospital in April 1902 at age 56. ==Operation as a hospital== Bard Hospital, c. 1910 Following the death of Cephas Bard, members of the Bard family continued to operate the hospital for more than 20 years. In 1923, the building was donated to the Big Sisters League. For approximately eight years, the League continued to operate the hospital. During the latter years, the hospital was known as the Big Sisters Hospital. ==Use by County of Ventura== When the new Hospital de Buenaventura (later renamed Community Memorial Hospital) was under construction, the Big Sisters League agreed to sell the building to the City of Ventura for $60,000. However, a city bond measure to pay for the purchase was defeated by voters. In August 1931, the County of Ventura stepped in and agreed to purchase the building for $25,000. The sale closed in March 1932. The County owned and used the building for 44 years from 1932 to 1976. In the early years after the purchase by the County, the western portion of the building became a detention facility, and other parts of the building were used as office space for the county welfare department and county statistician. In later years, it provided offices for the County's human relations commission, farm advisor, and agricultural bureau. By 1975, the building had fallen into disrepair with peeling paint, broken windows, holes in the ceiling, and some parts deemed unsafe and used only for storage. An analyst for the County of Ventura at that time stated that the building was beyond rehabilitation, too expensive to bring up to code, would probably be demolished, and \\"would make a good place for some apartment.\\" ==Historic designation and renovation== The City of Ventura designated the building as Ventura Historic Landmark No. 19 on March 8, 1976. In September 1976, the County sold the building to Inventors Workshop International (IWI) for $91,500. IWI stated that it intended to renovate the building and to use a portion of the building as an exhibit center for inventions and the remainder of the building as the company's headquarters. IWI owned the building for five years and undertook only limited renovation work. The main portion of the building was declared unsafe, and IWI used only a rear annex of the building to conduct its operations. At IWI's request, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in November 1977. In late 1981, IWI sold the building for $500,000 to an investment group in Woodland Hills. In 1982, the new ownership group extensively renovated the building at a cost of $1.3 million. Architect David Osborne finalized the plans for the work. The renovation included the following elements: * An addition variously stated to be 2,800, 5,000, or 7,000 square feet, extending the second floor north to Buena Vista Street; * Creation of eight office suites ranging from 1,087 to 2,620 square feet; * Demolition of a small building in the rear, which was found to be infested with termites; * Reinforcement of the main supporting columns which were found to stand on unreinforced beach rocks. * Enclosure of the bell tower at the building's southeast corner; and * Removal of a large concrete slab laid in front of the hospital in 1906; * Replacement of roof tiles with the exception of the bell tower where the original tiles were retained. The renovated building was opened for leasing in February 1983. ==See also== * City of Ventura Historic Landmarks and Districts * National Register of Historic Places listings in Ventura County, California * Reportedly haunted locations in California ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Ventura, California Category:Defunct hospitals in California Category:Hospitals in Ventura County, California Category:Hospital buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ventura, California Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1902 Category:Mission Revival architecture in California ","title":"Elizabeth Bard Memorial Hospital"},{"id":"19296276","text":"Sarotrocercus (meaning \\"long-tailed sweeper\\") is a small Cambrian organism known from Burgess shale-type localities, reaching a centimetre or two in length (). It was pelagic and swam on its back. It may lie in the arthropod crown group, and a recent study has revised some points of its original description. == Morphology == It had a head shield followed by a body of nine segments and a caudal tip featuring a series of spines on the end. A pair of big eyes at the end of stalks emerged from the front of the shield. The head bore a pair of sturdy appendages that ended in a bidentate segment. Ten pairs of appendages with an elongated structure of comb-shaped, probably gill branches, are attached to the at the head segment (one pair) and the body segments (nine pairs). == Ecology == This small animal was a creature that swam freely on its back, moving perhaps through movements of the gills and the action of its long tail tuft. The Burgess Shale contains few swimming organisms; the submarine landslides that buried organisms mainly smothered benthic and nektobenthic organisms. Organisms living in the water column above this habitat were able to escape and above the 'danger zone' and are therefore much rarer.

The term \\"Christian rock\\" had not yet been coined in 1968 and these compositions can be considered the missing link between secular and Christian rock music. ==History== The group's purpose was to make a demonstration record to interest a recording company in signing the group. Seven of the songs were recorded at Glen Campbell Studio in Pittsburgh, Pa.

One of the demos accomplished the purpose of getting the band signed to RCA and commercially packaged records of the session were never ordered. The Master Tape was used again and recorded over as was the custom in many small studios in the 60s. Except for a brief appearance in 1983, when five cassette tapes were made from the only known remaining acetate, the acetate and the cassettes remained out of sight, and out of mind.

The seminary is located at 1300 South Steele Street in the Cory-Merrill neighborhood of Denver, on the campus of the St. John Paul II Center for the New Evangelization. ==History== St. John Vianney Theological Seminary was constituted on March 17, 1999 to replace the former Saint Thomas Seminary that had been operating at the same site since 1907. Since its founding, the seminary has been dedicated to forming priests for the new millennium and offering programs for the formation of permanent deacons and lay faithful. The groundwork for St. John Vianney Seminary was laid by Cardinal James Stafford, then the Archbishop of Denver, who purchased the site of the former St. Thomas Seminary from the Congregation of the Mission in 1995. The facility was remodeled and the grounds were renamed the St. John Paul II Center for the New Evangelization in order to also serve as a campus for the Archdiocesan Chancery.Archdiocese of Denver Archives Archbishop Charles J. Chaput, O.F.M. Cap., the successor to J. Francis Cardinal Stafford, completed a study in order to determine the feasibility of establishing an educational institution on the site. After consulting with priests and the people of the Archdiocese, he formulated a plan to open a theological institute to serve the formation needs of clergy and laity. These plans resulted in St. John Vianney Theological Seminary, a free-standing diocesan seminary with a spirituality year, pre-theologate and theologate for priestly formation. The plans also called for the establishment of the St. Francis School of Theology for Deacons, the Catechetical School, and Denver Catholic Biblical School for lay formation. ==Academics== St. John Vianney offers programs in the formation of candidates to the Roman Catholic priesthood, formation for Roman Catholic permanent deacon candidates, and lay formation programs.St. John Vianney Theological Seminary Catalog ===Seminary=== From its founding, St. John Vianney has been committed to the four pillars of formation which are found in Pope John Paul II's Pastores Dabo Vobis: Human Formation, Spiritual Formation, Pastoral Formation and Intellectual Formation. The programs for study in seminary formation at St. John Vianney include a Spirituality Year, which is a non-academic year for discernment; a Pre- Theology Cycle which includes a study of philosophy as well as language study and introductory courses in theology; and a Theology Cycle which is a four- year program of study theological and pastoral disciplines required for ordination. Spirituality Year House at St. John Vianney. Spirituality Year St. John Vianney's Spirituality Year was the first in the United States and it aims to develop the four pillars of formation in each man and gives each seminarian the opportunity to lay a strong spiritual foundation for his priestly life and for the remainder of his seminary training. SY is marked by a commitment to prayer and has 3 retreats throughout the year with the capstone experience of a 30-day silent Ignatian retreat. Of special note in the Spirituality Year is the media fast, in which the men turn from the world and toward Christ by giving up the use of phones, television, computers, and popular media. The seminarians in SY live in a separate community on the seminary grounds and pray, study, work and recreate together. This allows them to grow in self-knowledge, form friendships, and grow in the mutual sense of being called to share in Christ's call and mission. In addition to community life, the men spend 2 hours a day in the classroom where Sacred Scripture, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, and spiritual classics are studied. Finally, the men go out into the community on apostolic assignments to teach young people, visit the elderly, or minister to the sick. In January of their Spirituality Year, the seminarians are sent out ‚Äútwo-by-two‚Äù for a whole month to be immersed in the lives and service to the poor. Some go to live and serve at a homeless shelter, others to an Indian reservation, others to the homes of the extremely poor. They go to bring Jesus to the poor and discover him waiting for them in the presence of the poor. Pre-Theology Cycle The Pre-Theology Cycle at St. John Vianney is a two- or three-year cycle of courses which covers three essential components: philosophy, introductory courses in theology, and languages. The seminarian's Diocese may choose between degree and non-degree programs in philosophy to meet the entrance requirements for the four-year Theology Program. The study of philosophy is central to the Pre-Theology Program. The goal of the philosophy curriculum is \\"to develop a reflective awareness of the fundamental relationship that exists between the human spirit and truth, that truth which is revealed to us fully in Jesus Christ.\\" St. John Vianney offers three undergraduate programs of philosophical study: the Standard Program in Pre-Theology; the Bachelor of Philosophy (B.Phil.) Degree; and the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) Degree with Philosophy Major. Theology Cycle The Theology Cycle at St. John Vianney is a four-year program of study in theological and pastoral disciplines which meet all of the requirements for priestly formation specified by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The program of studies integrates various areas of theology to form seminarians in the wisdom of the Church. Each seminarian is enrolled in a graduate level program that enables him to earn both a Sacred Theology Baccalaureate Degree (S.T.B.) and a Master of Divinity Degree (M.Div.) prior to ordination. ===Diaconate formation=== St Francis School of Theology for Deacons, (SFSTD), is a division of St John Vianney Seminary. This school provides for the Archdiocese of Denver a specific place for the training and formation of permanent deacons while utilizing the same professors as the seminary. The men who are ordained to Holy Orders provide service of Liturgy, Word, and Sacrament to the Church of Northern Colorado. Admission to study is limited to men under the age of 60. ===Lay formation=== The Catechetical School and the Denver Catholic Biblical School are divisions of St. John Vianney Seminary for laypeople. The Catechetical School offers small group dynamics, independent study, personal application, and lectures. The Denver Catholic Biblical School offers lectures, small-group discussions and weekly coursework on the Bible.The Biblical School holds prayer days and retreats throughout the year, pilgrimages to the Holy Land, Greece, and Rome, and continuing education for graduates of the School. Christ the King Chapel located at St. John Vianney Theological Seminary ==Accreditation & Affiliations== St. John Vianney is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools and enjoys affiliation with the Angelicum in Rome and Regis University in Denver. ==Administration== Previous Rectors of St. John Vianney include Denver's current Archbishop Samuel J. Aquila, Msgr. Michael Glenn, Rev. Scott Traynor. the Rector was Fr.

Feraud moved to Ventura in 1875, became a partner in the Ventura Bakery on Main Street, and eventually bought out his partner. By 1890, Feraud had moved his bakery, which by then also included a grocery store and saloon, to a wood-frame structure on the southwest corner of Main Street and Ventura Avenue. In 1903, Feraud built a new and larger brick structure on the site. In the new building, Feraud operated a grocery, bakery, feed and hay warehouse.

A richly productive field in the 1930s, the Ellwood Oil Field was important to the economic development of the Santa Barbara area. The Japanese submarine I-17 shelled the area during World War II, the first direct naval bombardment of the U.S. continent of the war, causing an invasion scare on the West Coast. ==Setting== Aerial: Ellwood Oil Field from West Sandpiper Golf Course with derricks in background, 1975. Photo by Charles O'Rear. The Ellwood Oil Field is located approximately west of the city of Santa Barbara, beginning at the western boundary of the city of Goleta, proceeding west into the Pacific and then back onshore near Dos Pueblos Ranch. The onshore portions of the field include beach, coastal bluffs, blufftop grasslands, and eucalyptus groves. Some of the former oil field is now part of the Ellwood-Devereux Open Space, maintained by the city of Goleta, and the Bacara Resort, Sandpiper Golf Course, and new Goleta housing developments sit on areas formerly occupied by pump-jacks, derricks, and oil storage tanks. The climate is Mediterranean, with an equable temperature regime year-round, and most of the precipitation falling between October and April in the form of rain. Freezes are rare. Runoff is towards the ocean, and to a few vernal pools on the bluffs. The offshore portions of the Ellwood oil field are in relatively shallow water, and were drilled from piers. The South Ellwood Offshore field is entirely beneath the Pacific Ocean, about from the main onshore oil field. It is entirely within the State Tidelands zone, which encompasses areas within of shore. These regions are subject to state, rather than Federal regulation. Currently the only production from this field is from Platform Holly, which is in of water, about from the coast at Coal Oil Point. Numerous directionally-drilled oil wells originate at the platform, and several pipelines connect the platform to an onshore oil processing facility adjacent to the Sandpiper Golf Course. ==Geology== Goleta Oil Field Geologic map Elwood Oil Field Structure Map The Ellwood Oil Field is roughly five miles long and up to a mile wide, with both its eastern and western extremity onshore. It is an anticlinal structure, with oil trapped stratigraphically by the anticline. The More Ranch Fault provides an impermeable barrier on the northeast. Oil occurs in several pools, with the largest being in the Vaqueros Sandstone, approximately below ground surface. Other significant pools occur in the Rincon Formation at a depth of , and in the Upper Sespe Formation at below ground surface. The Ellwood Oil Field contained approximately of oil, almost all of which has been removed, to the degree possible with the technology available until the early 1970s. The field now has been abandoned. The South Ellwood Offshore field has been estimated by the US Department of Energy to hold over one billion barrels of oil Department of Energy description of Venoco operations and approximately , most of which is in the undeveloped portion of the field. In 1995, the Oil and Gas Journal reported of proven reserves.article on Mobil's Clearview project Oil from the Ellwood field was generally light and sweet, with an API gravity averaging 38 and low sulfur content (making it \\"sweet\\" in petroleum parlance). Oil from the offshore field is medium-grade, ranging from API gravity 25 to 34, and has a higher sulfur content, requiring more processing than the oil from the decommissioned onshore field. Several pools have been identified in the South Ellwood Offshore field, in three major vertical zones. The upper Monterey Formation contains a large pool in a zone of fractured shale at an average depth of below the ocean floor. Beneath that, a separate pool exists in the Rincon Sand, below the ocean floor, and yet another in the Vaqueros Formation at a depth of . The deepest well drilled to date is into the Rincon Formation. ==History and productionGoleta Oil Field=== This was a short-lived oil field which produced for only 13 months before water appeared in the wells. Production ceased by Feb. 1928. Miley Oil Company drilled the No. Goleta 1 discovery well, with oil shows at 613 and 1,527 feet. ===Ellwood Oil Field=== Barnsdall-Rio Grande gas station, built in 1929 next to the Ellwood Oil Field The field is named for Ellwood Cooper (1829-1918), who owned the large Ellwood Ranch in what is now Goleta and the adjacent hills. His first name lingers in several local place names including the oil fields, Ellwood Canyon, Ellwood School, Ellwood Station Road, and the Goleta neighborhood \\"Ellwood\\". The first oil discovery in the area was in July 1928, by Barnsdall Oil Co. of California and the Rio Grande Company, who drilled their Luton-Bell Well No. 1 to a depth of into the Vaqueros Sandstone. After almost giving up they not only struck oil, but had a significant gusher, initially producing . This discovery touched off a period of oil leasing and wildcat well drilling on the Santa Barbara south coast, from Carpinteria to Gaviota. During this period, the Mesa Oil Field was discovered, within the Santa Barbara city limits, about east of the Ellwood field.Schmitt, R. J., Dugan, J. E., and M. R. Adamson. \\"Industrial Activity and Its Socioeconomic Impacts: Oil and Three Coastal California Counties.\\" MMS OCS Study 2002-049.

The \\"cactus patch\\" incident occurred about 300 meters west of the damaged well. A consequential visit by a foreigner occurred in the late 1930s. Kozo Nishino, the skipper of a Japanese oil tanker, visited the field to load oil. While walking with his crew to a formal welcoming ceremony onshore, he tripped and fell into a patch of prickly pear cactus (now below Fairway 11 of the Sandpiper Golf Course). The sight of the proud Japanese commander having cactus spines pulled from his buttocks provoked laughter from a group of nearby oil workers.California State Military Department description of the Ellwood shelling Kozo came back a few years later, possibly for revenge. During World War II‚Äînow captain of Japanese submarine I-17‚Äîhe surfaced just off of Coal Oil Point on the evening of February 23, 1942. His crew emerged and manned the sub's 5.5\\" deck gun. They fired between 16 and 25 rounds at a pair of oil storage tanks near where he had fallen into the cactus. His gunners were poor shots, and most of the shells went wild, exploding either miles inland on Tecolote Ranch, or splashing in the water. One of the explosions damaged well Luton-Bell 17, on the beach just below Fairway 14 of the present-day golf course, causing about $500 in damage to a catwalk and some pumping equipment. Kozo radioed Tokyo that he had \\"left Santa Barbara in flames.\\" This incident was the first direct naval bombardment by an enemy power on the U.S. continent since the bombardment of Orleans in World War I.German U-Boat Attacks Cape CodMcKinney, John. California's Coastal Parks. Wilderness Press, 2005. p. 101. Tompkins, Walker A. It Happened in Old Santa Barbara. Sandollar Press, 1976. p. 306. The Ellwood field reached peak production in 1930, but it remained productive through the 1960s. The onshore portion was abandoned in 1972. Today the site of the oilfield equipment damaged by the Japanese is now Santa Barbara County property, which may be traversed by the public, on the beach below the Sandpiper Golf Course. A historical marker on a rock on the Golf Course grounds recounts the Japanese attack. ===South Ellwood Offshore field=== All oil drilling into the South Ellwood Offshore field took place from Platform Holly, located about offshore The existence of an offshore field was suspected for a long time, largely due to the persistent natural seepage of oil from the sea floor. The Coal Oil Point seep field is now one of the most actively studied seep zones in the world. In 1966, ARCO built Platform Holly, in of water approximately southwest of Coal Oil Point, and began drilling wells into the various zones in the South Ellwood Offshore field. Peak production from the field was in 1984. Mobil operated Platform Holly until 1997, when Venoco acquired all rights to the field. Three pipelines ‚Äì one oil, one gas, and one for utilities ‚Äì connected the platform to the processing plant on the mainland. In addition, an oil pipeline transported oil from \\"tents\\" constructed over some of the natural seeps on the ocean floor to the processing plant. Leakage from the natural seeps near Platform Holly decreased substantially, probably from the decrease in reservoir pressure from the oil and gas produced at the platform.Emission estimates for the Coal Oil Point Seep Field , August 2000, UCSB Hydrocarbon Seeps project Away from Platform Holly, much of the field is still not fully explored and developed. Mobil's 1995 proposal to drill from the shore (the \\"Clearview\\" project, dubbed \\"Drillview\\" by opponents) was rejected, and a proposal to drill into the more distant parts of the field from the existing Platform Holly was under consideration in 2009. The proposal involved directionally drilling 40 new wells from the existing platform, potentially tripling its production. Platform Holly has been inactive since the Refugio Oil Spill in May 2015 ruptured the pipeline it relies on to transport oil to market. Venoco has since filed bankruptcy, and the platform is being decommissioned. Ownership of the platform has been transferred to the state, which is now responsible for removal of the structure. The California State Lands Commission says the work to plug and abandon the wells will begin in 2019, with an estimated two to three years until completion. ==See also== *Coal Oil Point seep field, large natural oil/gas leak in the Ellwood offshore oilfield. *Asphalt volcano, includes recent underwater discoveries here. *LA Basin *La Goleta Gas Field ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * ==External links== * California Department of ConservationCalifornia DOGGR Online Mapping System Category:Oil fields in Santa Barbara County, California Category:Geography of Santa Barbara County, California ","title":"Ellwood Oil Field"},{"id":"19296865","text":"\\"Dangerous Type\\" is a 1979 song by the Cars from their second studio album, Candy-O.

Her time of 4:06.03 in the 1500 metres at the 2002 Asian Games is the current national record. She was awarded Arjuna Award in 1999 and Padma Shri for her achievements. == Career == Sunita hails from Sunam, Punjab and is best known for her performance at the 2002 Asian games, where she won a gold medal in the 1500 m and a bronze medal in the 5000 m races. Sunita has spoken out about the need for better facilities in order to motivate athletes. She was also working as an Superintendent of Police in Pathankot, Punjab. == Controversy == Sunita Rani was hit with controversy about her performance at the 2002 Asian games, where she won a gold medal in the 1500m and a bronze medal in 5000m, after she tested positive for nandrolone, a banned substance that aids recovery, strength and endurance, in the dope tests. Both her medals were revoked. However, the Indian Olympic Association fought to prove that the doping tests had major procedural irregularities, and that the results were not valid. Rani has categorically maintained that she had not taken any banned substances. She had also cleared the dope test in Delhi, on the eve of the Indian team's departure to Busan. The Olympic Council of Asia later officially admitted that there had been discrepancies in her dope test. On January 3, 2003, the International Association of Athletics Federations officially cleared her off her doping charges, and reinstated her medals. The Amateur Athletic Federation of India held a 'Restoration of Medals' ceremony on February 4, 2003, to officially return her medals to her. == References Category:Living people Category:Sportswomen from Punjab, India Category:Indian female long-distance runners Category:20th- century Indian women Category:Indian female middle-distance runners Category:Indian police officers Category:Asian Games gold medalists for India Category:Asian Games silver medalists for India Category:Asian Games bronze medalists for India Category:Asian Games medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1998 Asian Games Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2002 Asian Games Category:World Athletics Championships athletes for India Category:Recipients of the Arjuna Award Category:Recipients of the Padma Shri in sports Category:1979 births Category:Indian women police officers Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Medalists at the 1998 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 2002 Asian Games ","title":"Sunita Rani"},{"id":"19297379","text":"Walter George \\"Wally\\" Don (25 September 1891 ‚Äì 1 June 1957) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Carlton and University.

The school serves about 800 students in grades 9 to 12. The towns of Eaton, Albany, DeSoto and Royerton are also serviced by Delta High School. ==History== Delta High School was created in June 1967 when DeSoto, Eaton, and Royerton High Schools consolidated to form Delaware Metropolitan School District. A committee of students from each school met to decide the school's name, colors, mascot, and to write the school's song. Several names were discussed, including Nor-Del, Grissom, and Apollo. Nor-Del was rejected because there already was a Wes-Del nearby. Grissom, in honor of Hoosier astronaut Gus Grissom who had died in a fire, was given strong consideration, but the committee then learned there already was another Grissom in Indiana. Apollo was another idea to honor the burgeoning space program. One of the 24 committee members, Dale DeHaven, a freshman from DeSoto, then suggested Delta. DeHaven said he came up with Delta by playing around with letters that were common to the three consolidating schools, Eaton, DeSoto, Royerton, and the word Delaware. The Eagle mascot was also chosen following the Greek motif by choosing Zeus's symbol of power and strength. Navy blue and gold were chosen for the school colors. An original school song written by Mary Jolliffe Kraack, 1968, was selected by the committee. Albany High School joined the Delaware Metropolitan School District in 1968 and the school district's name was changed to Delaware Community School Corporation. In 1968, the DARE Eagle was designed and became the official mascot for Delta because the students of Delta High School DARE to be outstanding in all areas. The letters in the word DARE were from the first letter in each of the four consolidated schools. D for DeSoto, A for Albany, R for Royerton, and E for Eaton. The ground was broken for the new school building in March 1972. In September 1974 the new Delta High School was opened. Delta High School was remodeled in 1992. It was once again remodeled in 2007 due to a mold problem.Delta's History Page . Delta High School. Retrieved on 15 September 2008. It also had many structural issues (leaks in the ceilings, etc.) and mold problems circa 2004-2007, but recent remodeling has hopefully helped to remedy this issue.

The department maintains its own greenhouse, which helps with the flowers and landscaping of the school. ===Dual Credit Classes=== Delta High School offers 25 hours of dual credit classes. Dual credit classes are courses that give students a credit for both high school and college. The dual credit classes that will be offered in Fall 2008 are Anatomy 201, Biology 100, Math 165, Physics 110, English 103, History 150. In the Spring 2009, the classes will include Physics 112 and English 104. The college credits are for Ball State University, and the credits can be transferred to most other colleges in Indiana, with the exception of the University of Notre Dame and Wabash College. A typical college class is one semester long, but three of the dual classes (English 103 and 104, Physics 110 and 112, and History 150) actually follow that protocol. Others are full-year courses. ===Student Publications=== The Eagle's Eye Magazine The Eagle's Eye newsmagazine is the Delta High School newspaper. It has a full- color cover and 28+ pages, including sections of color. The magazine includes stories on students and about topics that appeal to students. The staff makes 5 to 6 magazines a year. Delta is one of the only schools in East Central Indiana to produce a magazine. The Eagle's Eye staff also often writes the news for the school's webpage. WWDS and Eagle Zone News WWDS is the name of the former radio station of Delta High School.

He played for the school's senior cricket team for five seasons, and captained it to victory in the Battle of the Saints against St Joseph's College in his final season, 1954-55. Inman made his first-class debut in 1956, representing Ceylon against India at the P Saravanamuttu Stadium. Although Inman didn't make an impact with the bat, he claimed the wicket of opener Nari Contractor. He would go on to play another 254 first- class matches but it would remain his only wicket. A left-handed middle-order batsman, Inman made sporadic appearances for Ceylon in the Gopalan Trophy during the remainder of the decade before moving to England and joining his countryman Stanley Jayasinghe at Leicestershire. His first match for the English club came against the touring Australian side in 1961 when he contributed 30 and 45 not out. He had to wait until 1963 to make his County Championship debut and a few days later he scored his maiden first-class century against Cambridge University. Inman was selected to tour England with the Ceylon team in 1968, but the tour was cancelled just before it was due to begin.S. S.

Despite the high tally of runs he only scored one century that season. Only in his final county season, 1971, did he score four hundreds in a year. One of those came in his final ever first-class match, played against Northamptonshire at Grace Road. Inman also played some List A cricket with Derbyshire in 1973.

This event was the heaviest of the women's judo weight classes, allowing competitors with over 70 kilograms of body mass. Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five-minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts. A total of seven judokas competed in the event. An eighth competitor, Anayasi Hernandez of Cuba, was disqualified for failing a pre-match medical exam.

He was known for his contributions to Tang during the Anshi Rebellion and for his subsequent defense of the western border against Tufan. == Background == An Chongzhang was born in 703, during the reign of Wu Zetian. His family was originally from ParthiaNew Book of Tang, vol. 75. but had lived for generations in the Hexi region, and his great-grandfather An Xinggui () was a contributor to Tang Dynasty's establishment, having overthrown one of the contenders for supremacy during the transition from Sui to Tang, Li Gui the Emperor of Liang and united Li Gui's Liang state to Tang. The An family was known for its capability in tending horses, and a number of An family members moved to the region around the Tang capital Chang'an and became students of literature, having intermarried with scholar-bureaucratic families. An Chongzhang, however, grew up in the western regions and was capable in horsemanship and archery. He started serving in the military early in his life, and was said to be full of tactics, careful, and faithful. Toward the end of the Tianbao era (742-756) of Wu Zetian's grandson Emperor Xuanzong, for An Chongzhang's accomplishments in the army, Emperor Xuanzong bestowed on him a new name‚ÄîBaoyu (meaning, \\"one who holds jade\\"). At the time that the general An Lushan rebelled at Fanyang (ËåÉÈôΩ, in modern Beijing) in 755 and soon established a new state of Yan, An Baoyu was defending Nanyang (). When An Lushan sent messengers to try to persuade him to submit to Yan, he killed An Lushan's messengers. == During Emperor Suzong's reign == In 756, Yan forces approached Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xuanzong to flee to Chengdu. Emperor Xuanzong's son and crown prince Li Heng did not follow him to Chengdu, but instead fled to Lingwu, where he was declared emperor (as Emperor Suzong)‚Äîan act that Emperor Xuanzong later recognized. One of the major generals that Emperor Suzong employed in the war against Yan was Li Guangbi, and Li Guangbi invited An Baoyu to serve under him. In 757, An Baoyu petitioned Emperor Suzong for a name change‚Äîstating, \\"Your subject has lived in Liang Prefecture for generations. I am ashamed to bear the same surname as the rebellious subject.\\" Emperor Suzong granted him the imperial surname of Li, and also permitted him to change his designated home to Chang'an‚Äîconsidered a substantial honor at the time.New Book of Tang, vol. 138 . This was applied retroactively to his Sogdian ancestors as well, all of whom would be referred with the surname Li instead of An. Li Baoyu was also made the military governor (Jiedushi) of Chenzheng Circuit (Èô≥ÈÑ≠, headquartered in modern Zhengzhou, Henan). Later in the year, when the new Yan emperor Shi Siming captured Luoyang (which, along with Chang'an, had been recaptured by Tang forces in 757), at Li Guangbi's request, Li Baoyu defended the southern fort at the important strategic position Heyang (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, near Luoyang) while Li Guangbi himself defended the central fort. Li Baoyu defended the southern fort despite an overwhelming Yan siege and eventually, Tang forces were able to stop the Yan advance. For Li Baoyu's contributions, he was created the Duke of Lecheng. In 761, however, when the eunuch official Yu Chao'en pressured Li Guangbi into trying to recapture Luoyang - which ended in spectacular failure‚ÄîLi Baoyu was also forced to abandon Heyang and flee, apparently to Ze Prefecture (Êæ§Â∑û, in modern Jincheng, Shanxi), for in 762, that was the location that Shi Siming's son and successor Shi Chaoyi put Li Baoyu under siege, which was lifted when the major general Guo Ziyi sent the Dingguo Army () to aid him, allowing Li Baoyu to turn the tables on the Yan forces and defeat them.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 222. == During Emperor Daizong's reign == Emperor Suzong died later in 762 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Daizong. Emperor Daizong made Li Baoyu, in addition to Chenzheng Circuit, the military governor of Zelu Circuit (Êæ§ÊΩû, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), where Li Baoyu was at the time. He also wanted to create Li Baoyu the Prince of Wuwei, but Li Baoyu earnestly declined the princely title; instead, Emperor Daizong created him the Duke of Liang and gave him the honorific title of Sikong ()‚Äîone of the Three Excellencies. Later in 762, Li Baoyu participated in the joint Tang and Huige campaign to recapture Luoyang, and after Luoyang fell and Shi Chaoyi fled, a number of Yan generals submitted to Tang‚Äîbut then were permitted to remain at their posts by the major Tang general Pugu Huai'en. Li Baoyu and another Tang general, Xin Yunjing (), thus suspected Pugu of planning to rebel and warned Emperor Daizong of such. (Pugu was in fact fearful that the imperial government would no longer consider him important and therefore planned an alliance with these former Yan generals, and did eventually rebel in 763. His rebellion would not dissipate until his death in 765.) In 763, Tufan forces made a surprise attack on Chang'an and captured it, forcing Emperor Daizong to flee to Shan Prefecture (ÈôùÂ∑û, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan). Although Emperor Daizong was able to return to Chang'an soon thereafter, in the aftermaths, absconding Tang soldiers and local bandits grouped together in the five valleys to the south of Chang'an and engaged in banditry that Tang local governments were unable to deal with. Emperor Daizong initially put the official Xue Jingxian () in charge of suppressing the bandits, but Xue was unable to successfully do so even after several months. In 764, Emperor Daizong gave Li Baoyu the additional responsibility of being the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) and put him in charge of the operations against the bandits. Li Baoyu used scouts to first discover the hidden headquarters of the bandits' leader Gao Yu () and was thereafter able to capture Gao by a surprise attack commanded by his subordinate Li Chongke (). It was said that within days, the banditry ceased. Also in 764, with another Tufan attack appearing to be looming, Emperor Daizong put Li Baoyu, along with Guo, in charge of defending against the Tufan forces. In light of Li Baoyu's being stationed at Fengxiang, Emperor Daizong made Li Baoyu's cousin Li Baozhen the deputy military governor of Zelu, and thereafter, while Li Baoyu was still titularly the military governor of Zelu, Li Baozhen was in actual command. In 765, when, near the end of Pugu's rebellion, a joint Huige and Tufan force that was intending to aid Pugu approached Chang'an, Li Baoyu was one of the generals who were summoned to defend Chang'an. (After Pugu died of illness around that time, Guo was able to persuade Huige forces to withdraw, and once Huige forces did so, so did Tufan forces.) In 767, Li Baoyu went to Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Daizong. He offered to resign one of his honorary titles‚ÄîZuo Pushe (Â∑¶ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ, which, if not honorary, would be one of the heads of the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng)). Emperor Daizong agreed, although when Li Baoyu then also offered to resign the command of Fengxiang Circuit, Emperor Daizong refused. In 770, as part of Emperor Daizong's plot with the chancellor Yuan Zai to kill Yu Chao'en, who had by then become overbearingly powerful, Yuan's ally Huangfu Wen () was moved from Shan Circuit (headquartered in modern Sanmenxia) to Fengxiang, while Li Baoyu was moved from Fengxiang to Shannan West Circuit (Â±±ÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi, to the southwest of Chang'an). When Li Baoyu was embarking from Fengxiang, heading for Shannan West's capital Zhouzhi (), it was said that his soldiers were so angry about the movement that they pillaged Fengxiang for several days. After Emperor Daizong and Yuan killed Yu soon thereafter, Huangfu was moved back to Shan and it appeared that Fengxiang was given back to Li Baoyu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 224. Later in the year, when Ma Lin () the military governor of Jingyuan Circuit (Ê∂áÂéü, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu) complained that his circuit was too poor to support his army, Emperor Daizong hinted to Li Baoyu that he should yield two prefectures out of his command‚ÄîZheng Prefecture (ÈÑ≠Â∑û, in modern Zhengzhou) and Ying Prefecture (ÊΩÅÂ∑û, in modern Xuchang, Henan)‚Äîand Li Baoyu did so; those prefectures were thereafter transferred to Ma. In 771, Li Baoyu submitted a petition to Emperor Daizong, asking for part of his responsibility area to be given to another general‚Äîpointing out that given how much of the Tufan frontier was in his responsibility area, if Tufan attacked multiple places, he would not be able to defend against all of the Tufan attacks. He offered to yield the command of Shannan West. Emperor Daizong was appreciative of Li Baoyu's willingness to yield, and agreed to do so, although there was no subsequent records of Emperor Daizong giving Shannan West to another general. In 775, when Tufan made further incursions, Li Baoyu defended against the attack. He died in 777. He was much mourned by Emperor Daizong and given posthumous honors.

By impounding water and allowing it to be released on the log drive's schedule, these dams allowed many more logs to be brought to market than the natural flow of the creek allowed. Water releases from multiple splash dams on tributaries were also often combined to maximize the number of logs floated throughout a given watershed. ==Construction== Splash dams were typically constructed of logs or boards, which formed cribs that were then filled with stones and earth. They could be anywhere from to several hundred feet wide, and were used from one to several years. A splash dam had to be sited on a section of the stream that allowed as large a body of water to accumulate behind the dam as possible. Behind the dam logs were transported to the creek and its banks, often along log slides. (No ISBN) The splash dam was equipped with a chute to allow water and logs to escape. When the chute was closed, water collected behind the dam. Construction work also extended to the stream below the splash dam, which had to be cleared of obstacles and often had its banks cleared for some distance above the waterline. This was an effort to prevent as many logs as possible from becoming stuck on the banks of the creek. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a law on March 28, 1871 allowing splash dam construction and clearing of creeks to allow loose logs to float better. ==Use== Pine Creek lumber drive, with arks for kitchen and dining (left), sleeping (center), and horses (right): the railroad is on the shore behind. Originally lumber was only floated downstream using seasonal high water, typically in spring following snowmelt. Loggers found that by constructing a dam to impound water they could control the level of water and float more logs, which improved conditions for log drivers. In addition to the annual early spring log drive in March, splash dams frequently allowed smaller drives anytime there was sufficient water: in Pennsylvania rains could lead to drives in May or June, and small drives in September or October were also possible. To give some idea of the scale of the log drives, Pennsylvania's Pine Creek, the largest tributary of the West Branch Susquehanna River, had produced rafts of pine spars for decades, ending in 1865. The earliest spring log drives there floated up to of logs in the creek at one time. In 1908, a single splash dam in northcentral Pennsylvania floated in one log drive. Log drives lasted four to six days in northern Pennsylvania. A series of arks, boats specially built for the drive, floated down the creek behind the logs. Typically one boat was the kitchen and dining area, one served as sleeping quarters for the men, and one provided shelter for the horses. The men and horses worked in the creek all day getting logs stranded on the banks back in the water. Log jams were a problem as well and required careful removal of one or more key logs to break the jam and allow the logs to again flow freely. Breaking a logjam might involve one or more men working with hand tools, or it might involve explosives. By impounding water and allowing it to be released on the log drive's schedule, these dams allowed many more logs to be brought to market than the natural flow of the creek allowed. Water releases from multiple splash dams on tributaries were also often combined to maximize the number of logs floated throughout a given watershed. On the Red River in eastern Kentucky, a series of carefully timed releases of water from splash dams allowed log drives to travel downstream. These drives had between 35,000 and 50,000 logs in them and one produced a log jam long. ==Legacy== Dam for Making Freshet for Floating Logs in Northern Michigan Dam for flooding logs, Michigan, 1870s Splash dams operated across the United States, from about 1860 to 1930. As of 2008, the United States Geological Survey Geographic Names Information System shows thirteen place names in the United States containing the words \\"splash dam\\".

Around 8:00 a.m. on September 8, 2008, the retaining wall of a waste iron ore reservoir collapsed after torrential rain, causing a major mudslide which inundated a village and crowded marketplace. The unlicensed Tashan Mine was operated by the Tashan Mining Company. ==History== The ore reservoir was built in the 1980s, halfway up a mountain, about 50 meters above an office building, marketplace and some residences. It was built only 100 meters away from the nearest residence. The reservoir was supposedly decommissioned a few years later, but its new owner, Zhang Peiliang, put it back into use when he took over the company in 2005. In 2006, the Tashan Mining Company did not renew its safety production license, and in 2007, the mining license of Zhang also expired. ==Damages and casualties== The entire village of Yunhe was inundated by the mudslide, including an outdoor market crowded with customers. As of September 24, the Chinese state media reported that the death toll was 267, and the number of injuries 34. Only 128 bodies, mostly of locals, have been identified. Some 268,000 cubic meters of mudslide sludge flooded over an area of 30.2 hectares in the disaster, and the mud was up to six meters deep in some parts. The final official count is: 277 dead, 4 missing and 33 injured. A worker had said \\"It's not because of the rain. It wasn't a natural disaster, it was man-made.\\" Up to 500 people may still be buried, according to the Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy. ==Rescue efforts== 5,300 police and rescuers, using more than 110 excavators, were looking for survivors. The rescuers covered about 90% of the mudslide zone so far. In addition, 2,100 medical workers were at the site to provide medical care. ==Aftermath== 1,047 people are displaced because of the mudslide. The provincial level government says relatives of the dead will receive 200,000 yuan (US$ 29,215). The Communist Party chief, the head of Taosi township, work safety bureau director, and chief engineer in Xiangfen county were dismissed for neglect of duty. Thirteen mine executives, including Zhang Peiliang, were detained by Chinese authorities, and four other local officials were also dismissed. The State Administration of Work Safety (SAWS) said that an investigation is pending, and that the people responsible will be \\"punished in line with the relevant laws.\\" Wang Jun, the director of SAWS said, \\"It is the most grave accident that involves the largest death toll so far this year. The rising accidents disclose local governments' poor supervision on work safety. Those responsible must be dealt with seriously.\\" Meng Xuenong, Governor of Shanxi, resigned a day after the event, on September 14. Wang Jun was subsequently transferred to become Governor of Shanxi. In September 2010, 58 people, including 34 former government officials, were handed out sentences in relation to the collapse. ==References== Category:2008 mining disasters Category:2008 industrial disasters Category:2008 disasters in China Category:Mining disasters in China Category:History of Shanxi Category:Landslides in China Category:Landslides in 2008 Category:September 2008 events in Asia ","title":"2008 Shanxi mudslide"},{"id":"19297781","text":"Versailles The Doge of Genoa at Versailles on the 15 May 1685 Reparation faite √† Louis XIV par le Doge de G√™nes by Claude Guy Halle, Palace of Versailles.

Leonard Lackman House is located on Imperial Avenue in Cohoes, New York, United States. Lackman was a local gunsmith and locksmith. His descendants still own and reside in the house as of 2009. It was built in the late 19th century in the then-popular Queen Anne architectural style. In 1998 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. ==Building== The house is a two-story, two-bay wood frame dwelling on a stone foundation. The first story is sided in clapboard; the second in imbricate shingle, flaring out at the floor line slightly. Both are currently painted different colors. The roof is steeply pitched and gabled. The mass of the house is broken up on every side in different ways, most noticeably at the front. The facade there, facing the street to the west, features the entrance's double wooden doors inside an enclosed porch on the north bay. It in turn has a pedimented roof. Above it rises a small turret with a window in the chamfered north and west and columns that rise to support a steep conical spirelet. To the south of the porch is a large, projecting bay window. This is topped with an overhanging bay on the second story and then the overhanging gabled dormer above it, bracketed by carved swags. On the north, the profile is broken by a projecting bay as well, on both stories, supporting another gable with carved swag brackets. A nearby stair bay is lit by a round-topped stained glass window. The south elevation features an enclosed brick porch with corbeled columns supporting a frieze at the flared roofline. Another porch, this time wooden, is on the east (rear) facade, which offers a view over downtown Cohoes and the Hudson River. The interior has seen little change. Many of its decorative features survive, such as the wall plaster, door surrounds, architraves, patterned metal ceilings and mantels. The entry hall, its newel-posted stairway lit by the stained-glass window on the north profile, has an inlaid parquet floor, delicate fireplace and mantel. ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:Houses completed in 1895 Category:Cohoes, New York Category:Houses in Albany County, New York Category:National Register of Historic Places in Albany County, New York ","title":"J.

He was the highest scoring Scotsman in the Royal Flying Corps, with 39 victories. Gilmour began his military career in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, but was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps. Gaining his wings on 17 March 1916, Gilmour was assigned to pilot the Martinsyde Elephant on the Western Front. He was one of the few successful scorers with the clumsy craft, downing three German opponents. He went on to establish a reputation as a crack bomber formation leader. In late 1917, he advanced to flying a Sopwith Camel fighter as a Flight Commander for No. 65 Squadron. Beginning on 18 December 1916, he reeled off a further 36 victories by 3 July 1918. That included five separate victories on 1 July 1918. He was then promoted to major and sent to command No. 28 Squadron in Italy. Post war, Gilmour was the air attache in Rome, then was posted to No. 216 Squadron in the Middle East. ==Early life== Gilmour was born in Helensburgh, Dumbartonshire, Scotland, the son of John James Gilmour, a tobacco merchant, and Isabella Inglis. He was educated at the Loretto School in Musselburgh, Edinburgh, and represented the school in rugby and fives. He was also a member of Officers' Training Corps, with the rank of sergeant. In December 1914, aged 18, Gilmour left school and joined the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders regiment with the rank of second lieutenant. ==Military service== Martinsyde Elephant, as flown by Gilmour. Gilmour transferred the Royal Flying Corps in December 1915, and was awarded the Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate No. 2888 after soloing in a Maurice Farman biplane at the military flying school at Farnborough on 17 March 1916. He was assigned to No. 27 Squadron. They were the sole squadron equipped with the Martinsyde G.100, commonly called the Elephant. This aircraft was nicknamed for being large and ungainly. A single seater, it was too big, slow, and manoeuvrable to be a successful fighter, and without a rear gunner, too defenceless to survive well in a ground attack or bombing role. It was equipped with a Lewis machine gun mounted on the upper wing firing over the propeller, and a second one on the fuselage pointed toward the rear. Nevertheless, before the Elephants were withdrawn from service, Gilmour scored three victories flying one, though his primary duty was bombing. On 15 September 1916, in conjunction with several other pilots, he destroyed an Albatros D.I. On the 24th, he destroyed a Fokker Eindekker; on the 26th, he drove another down out of control. On 26 May 1917, Gilmour received the Military Cross (MC) for his prowess as a bombing formation leader. At this point, he was almost certainly still flying the Martinsyde. Late in 1917, Gilmour was assigned to No. 65 Squadron RAF as a flight commander.Franks, p. 61. After a fourteen-month gap in his aerial victory list, he scored flying a Sopwith Camel, on 18 December 1917. His two triumphs that day made him an ace. He shot a triple on 4 January 1918, including one down in flames, and followed it up with number eight on 9 January. He then began to run up his score by single and double victories‚Äîtwo in February, one in March, seven in April, eight in May, four in June. By 29 June, his total was 31. On 1 July 1918, Gilmour capped his career with a performance that earned him a Distinguished Service Order (DSO). On that evening, within 45 minutes, he burned two Fokker D.VIIs and knocked another down out of control, set an Albatros D.V afire, and drove a Pfalz D.III out of the air. The times on his combat reports make it clear these were five separate engagements; many times, aces reporting multiple victories scored in a single engagement. Gilmour destroyed a Pfalz the next day, and two the day after, for his final successes. In the end, his victory record showed that he had 1 balloon destroyed, 1 enemy aircraft captured, 24 aircraft destroyed (and 3 shared destroyed) and 10 claimed 'out of control'. Eight of the destroyed craft had gone down in flames, as had the balloon.Shores, et. al, pp. 168-169. He was promoted to major and transferred to Italy to command No. 28 Squadron, but added no further victories to his record. His victory list made him the leading ace of the 13 aces in 65 Squadron. On 3 August 1918, Gilmour was awarded the DSO; on 16 September, he was gazetted for his second Bar to his MC. ==Postwar career== After the war, he had a brief tenure as air attach√© in Rome in July 1919. He then transferred to the Middle East to join No. 216 Squadron RAF. John Gilmour died in St James's Street, London, on 25 February 1928. A verdict of suicide while of unsound mind was returned at an inquest. Gilmour's medals were auctioned on 13 September 2012, and sold for ¬£40,000. ==Awards and honours== ;Military Cross :Second Lieutenant (Temporary Lieutenant) John Gilmour, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and RFC. ::For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in carrying out long-distance bomb raids.

Water gushing from the three spring outlets The Baotu Spring is the most renowned among the more than 70 named artesian springs in the downtown area of the city of Jinan. The water of all these springs originates from an Ordovician karst aquifer under the city. As the terrain around Jinan slopes from the south down to the north, the recharge area for the aquifer is located in the mountainous area to the south of the city. The recharge area of the springs covers 1,500 square kilometres, out of which 550 km2 provide direct recharge and 950 km2 indirect recharge.Q. Wu and H.

The spring pool is surrounded by historical structures such as the Leyuan (or Luoyuan) Hall (Song dynasty, to the north of the spring), the Guanlan Pavilion (Ming dynasty, west of the spring), and the Laihe Bridge (built during the Wanli era in the Ming dynasty, east of the spring). Close by, on the shore of the spring's runoff stands the Wangheting Teahouse. Other noteworthy structures are the Banbi Corridor and the Waterside Chamber. The largest architectural ensemble is the 10,000 Bamboo Garden (). It comprises 186 buildings arranged around 13 courtyards as well as four pavilions and five bridges. Originally built during the Yuan dynasty, it served as the residence of the governor of Shandong during the Ming dynasty. Later, it was the home of the poet Wang Ping, who purchased it during the Qing dynasty in 1692. In 1912, Zhang Huaizhi, a commander of the local army who later became governor of Shandong Province, bought the garden and kept enlarging it from 1912 to 1927.

He is the fourth person to hold that position during the presidency of Donald Trump. ==Education and early career== O'Brien was born in Los Angeles and raised in Santa Rosa, California, where he attended Cardinal Newman High School. He received a B.A. in political science from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1988, and a J.D. from the UC Berkeley School of Law in 1991. He won a Rotary scholarship to study at the University of the Free State in South Africa in 1987. From 1996 to 1998, O'Brien was a legal officer with the United Nations Compensation Commission in Geneva, Switzerland, which reviewed and processed claims resulting from Iraq's 1990‚Äì91 invasion and occupation of Kuwait. The amounts of compensation ranged into hundreds of millions of dollars, and were sourced from a 30% take from Iraq's oil revenues. O'Brien served as a Major in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the US Army Reserve. While in private practice he also served in appointive positions for the Bush, Obama, and Trump administrations. ==Private practice== O'Brien was the California managing partner of Arent Fox LLP, a national law firm, for seven years. During that time he grew the California offices from 10 attorneys to more than 110. He represented Buzz Aldrin in a number of high-profile cases, and also represented the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste in proceedings initiated by ConocoPhillips. O'Brien was the federal court- appointed Discovery Master in the MGA v. Mattel (\\"Barbie v. Bratz\\") case. O'Brien also serves as the federal court appointed Discovery Master on the recently settled United States of America v. McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Financial Services Inc.. O'Brien was a civilian observer for the Pacific Council on International Policy at the pre-trial hearings for alleged September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, in June 2014. He served on the International Republican Institute's delegations observing the Republic of Georgia's 2013 presidential election and Ukraine's 2014 parliamentary election. O'Brien was a founding partner, along with former federal judge Stephen Larson, of the Los Angeles boutique law firm Larson O'Brien LLP, which they established in January 2016. O'Brien retired from the firm when he was appointed National Security Advisor. ==Political careerGeorge W. Bush and Obama administrations=== O'Brien with Condoleezza Rice in 2007 O'Brien was nominated by President George W. Bush as the U.S. Alternate Representative to the 60th session of the United Nations General Assembly during 2005‚Äì06. He addressed the General Assembly on the question of Palestine, and represented the United States in the General Assembly's Sixth Committee, which considered the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism. O'Brien served as Co-Chairman of the U.S. Department of State's Public-Private Partnership for Justice Reform in Afghanistan, launched in December 2007, which \\"promoted the rule of law\\" in Afghanistan by training judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys. He continued this role during the first term of the Obama administration. On July 31, 2008, President Bush announced his intention to appoint O'Brien to serve in his administration as a member of the Cultural Property Advisory Committee, an advisory committee on issues involving antiquities and cultural matters, for the remainder of a three-year term which expired on April 25, 2011. === Mitt Romney 2012 campaign === In October 2011, O'Brien was named to Mitt Romney's advisory team as Co- Chair of the International Organizations Work Group. === 2016 presidential election === Later, in May 2015, he became an adviser on foreign policy and national security affairs for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's presidential campaign. After Walker left the race, O'Brien advised Ted Cruz's campaign. During the time he advised Ted Cruz's presidential campaign, he claimed: \\"It's clear that Vladimir Putin just doesn't like [Hillary Clinton], and is going to do what he can to help Donald Trump.\\" ===Trump administration=== O'Brien sworn in as Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs in 2018 White House Situation Room during the U.S. military raid on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2019 In 2017, O'Brien was under consideration by the Donald Trump administration to serve as Secretary of the Navy. The Orange County Register editorial board endorsed O'Brien to serve in this position, stating, \\"He is the ideal candidate to ensure American global dominance continues‚Äîin a way that fits both the present national mood and our enduring national values.\\" From May 25, 2018 to October 3, 2019, O'Brien served as the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs. He was given the rank of ambassador one year after his appointment. He attended the trial of the American rapper ASAP Rocky in Stockholm, Sweden and told reporters \\"The president sent me here, so it's totally appropriate. I also help free people that are held by governments, so unjustly detained Americans.\\" O'Brien had written the Swedish government warning of \\"negative consequences\\" if the case was not resolved. He \\"helped secure the 2018 release of American pastor Andrew Brunson, whose two-year imprisonment in Turkey heightened tensions between Washington and Ankara.\\" O'Brien was also involved in obtaining the release of Danny Burch, an American oil worker held in Yemen for a year, and who ultimately received an Oval Office meeting with President Trump. O'Brien took office as the 28th United States National Security Advisor on September 18, 2019. President Trump appointed O'Brien to succeed John Bolton, who resigned earlier that month. A few days later, O'Brien announced that Matthew Pottinger would become the deputy national security advisor, replacing Charles Kupperman in that role. O'Brien was seen as a traditional foreign policy conservative rather than a firebrand. Early in his tenure, O'Brien accompanied Vice President Mike Pence to meet Turkish President Recep Erdogan in efforts to achieve a ceasefire between Turkey and Kurdish forces in Syria after the U.S. abruptly withdrew military forces that stood between Turkish and Kurdish forces. In December 2019, O'Brien defended Trump's decision to pardon Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, a convicted war criminal who was alleged by multiple fellow Navy SEALs of shooting innocent civilians and of murdering a sedated injured teenage ISIS fighter. After the Trump administration's strike against Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and commander of its Quds Force, O'Brien defended the intelligence the administration used to justify the killing, arguing that Soleimani had been planning attacks on U.S. military and diplomatic installations in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East. O'Brien prays at the Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City O'Brien was named to the White House Coronavirus Task Force when it was established on January 29, 2020. He took a low profile in responding to the pandemic. In July 2020, he was reported to have contracted the virus. The National Security Council under O'Brien took a greater focus on China, and he aligned himself with Peter Navarro, a fellow hardliner on China. He threatened sanctions against China if it moved to pass a national security law that pro-democracy activists believed would undermine freedom in Hong Kong. O'Brien also criticized China for its actions amid territorial disputes in the South China Sea, and oversaw an increase in U.S. and allied military activity intended to guarantee freedom of navigation. O'Brien criticized China's government, saying in a speech that \\"The Chinese Communist Party is Marxist-Leninist,\\" and \\"The party General Secretary Xi Jinping sees himself as Josef Stalin‚Äôs successor.\\" In the same speech, he asserted: \\"Together with our allies and partners, we will resist the Chinese Communist Party's efforts to manipulate our people and our governments, damage our economies, and undermine our sovereignty.\\" O'Brien, Trump and Mike Pompeo with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan in November 2019 As plans emerged to reduce the number of U.S. military forces stationed in Europe, O'Brien defended the move, arguing, \\"The Cold War practice of garrisoning large numbers of troops with their families on massive bases in places like Germany is now, in part, obsolete.\\" When many other intelligence officials who had been involved in briefing Trump on national security characterized Trump as inattentive, O'Brien disputed the characterization, saying Trump was \\"laser-focused on the issues at hand and asks probing questions throughout the briefings ‚Äî it reminds me of appearing before a well-prepared appellate judge and defending the case.\\" Trump, O'Brien and Jared Kushner with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Ahmedabad, India, February 2020 O'Brien cut the National Security Council staff, with a plan to limit its size to 105 professionals. It had grown from 110 staff members in the Bush administration to over 240 under the Obama administration. He argued the purpose was to restore the coordinating function of the organization: \\"Under previous administrations, the NSC more than doubled in size and duplicated many of the functions of DoD, State and the intelligence community. Under President Trump, we have brought the NSC back to its proper size and role as a coordinating body.\\" For the first time, half of the senior directors at the NSC were women under O'Brien's management. In May 2020, after the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, O'Brien rejected that there was systemic racism in U.S. police forces. In an article published on July 12, 2020, three weeks after the release of his predecessor's book The Room Where It Happened, O'Brien defended Trump's record on China, stating that \\"the United States continues to stand against [the Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs coercive population-control policies] policies, especially as they are aimed at the Uighurs.\\" Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, it was announced on July 27, 2020, that O'Brien had been diagnosed with COVID-19. White House officials announced that O'Brien was experiencing \\"mild symptoms\\" and is \\"self-isolating and working from a secure location off site\\". A summit at the White House between Kosovo and Serbia was organized by Richard Grenell and scheduled for September 3 and 4, 2020. Grenell, along with O'Brien, cohosted the talks. On September 4, the agreements were signed by Serbian President Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá and Kosovo Prime Minister Avdullah Hoti. The signing ceremony took place in the Oval Office at the White House in the presence of US President Donald Trump on September 4, 2020.Ministry of Economy of Serbia (sitting left), Richard Grenell, Special US Presidential Envoy for Serbia and Kosovo Peace Negotiations (standing right), Eset Berisha, Director of the Civil Aviation Authority of Kosovo (sitting right) In August 2020, O'Brien said that President Trump should be eligible for the Nobel Peace Prize after the \\"historic\\" peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. O'Brien served as part of a U.S.-Israeli delegation on the first commercial flight from Israel to the UAE on August 31, 2020. The UAE and Israel moved to establish full diplomatic ties after Israel agreed to suspend a plan to annex parts of the occupied West Bank. On September 11 a new peace agreement was by the administration between Bahrain and Israel. Some commentators have speculated about O'Brien's future in politics after the Trump administration, including speculation he could be a candidate for president in 2024. ==Personal life== Raised a Catholic, O'Brien converted to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in his twenties. He is married to Lo-Mari O'Brien, and the couple raised three children: Margaret, Robert and Lauren. His son Robert died in an accidental drowning in 2015. ==Books== O'Brien is the author of the 2016 book While America Slept: Restoring American Leadership to a World in Crisis. Writing in Foreign Policy, Daniel Runde said, \\"While America Slept is the 2016 equivalent of Richard Nixon's The Real War.\\" A former colleague from the George W. Bush administration, Runde summarized O'Brien's views as follows: In The Hill, Bart Marcois, a retired foreign service officer, wrote, \\"If you're wondering what trends and events will drive President-elect Donald Trump's foreign policy, you need to read While America Slept, by Robert O'Brien.\\" Other reviews were more critical. Alex Ward, the associate director in the Atlantic Council's Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security, noted that \\"O'Brien's book is frustrating because it starts with the assumption that all of Obama's foreign policy choices are bad and assumes the reader believes this as well...[H]is analysis, while passionately and decently argued, missed the bigger picture through the partisan fog.\\" The book is broadly critical of the Obama administration's security and foreign policies. ==See also== * ==References *State Department Cultural Property Advisory Committee *Arent Fox listing for O'Brien * Category:1966 births Category:20th- century American lawyers Category:21st-century American lawyers Category:California Republicans Category:Converts to Mormonism Category:Former Roman Catholics Category:Latter Day Saints from California Category:Lawyers from Los Angeles Category:Living people Category:Military personnel from California Category:People from Santa Rosa, California Category:UC Berkeley School of Law alumni Category:United States National Security Advisors Category:United States Special Envoys Category:University of California, Los Angeles alumni Category:White House Coronavirus Task Force ","title":"Robert C.

It was probably composed in the third quarter of the twelfth century (1150-71) by a Tuscan poet. It is the earliest surviving piece of poetry in an unmistakably Italian dialect. Salv'a lo vescovo senato comprises twenty monorhyming ottonari. In the same manuscript is found a martyrology. Two internal references in the poem constrain its dating: a mention of Galgano Inghirami, Bishop of Volterra from 1150 to 1157, and of Grimaldo, Bishop of Osimo from 1151 to 1157. Bruno Migliorini describes the poem: > Il giullare si rivolge a un vescovo (Villano, arcivescovo di Pisa, secondo > l'ipotesi del Cesareo, accolta dal Mazzoni) facendone lodi sperticate e > pronosticandogli nientemeno che il pontificato, con la speranza di ottenere > in dono un cavallo: se lo ottiene, lo mostrer√† al vescovo di Volterra, > Galgano.Bruno Migliorini (1971), Storia della lingua italiana (Florence: > Sansoni), p. 104. > The jongleur addresses a bishop (Villano, Archbishop of Pisa, according to > the hypothesis of Cesareo, following Mazzoni) making drawn-out praises and > go so far as to predict for him a pontificate, in the hopes of obtaining a > horse: if he obtains it, he will show it to the bishop of Volterra, Galgano. ==External links== *Giuseppe Bonghi, Introduzione ai Ritmi delle Origini della Letteratura italiana (Duecento) *Text at Bibliotheca Augustana ==Notes== Category:Italian poems Category:Medieval poetry ","title":"Salv'a lo vescovo senato"},{"id":"19297947","text":"Spanish Formosa () was a small colony of the Spanish Empire established in the northern tip of the island known to Europeans at the time as Formosa (now Taiwan) from 1626 to 1642. It was ceded to the Dutch Republic during the Eighty Years' War. The Portuguese were the first Europeans to reach the island off the southern coast of China in 1544, and named it Formosa (Portuguese for \\"beautiful\\") due to the beautiful landscape as seen from the sea. Northern Taiwan became a Spanish colony in 1626 and part of the Manila-based Spanish East Indies. As a Spanish colony, it was meant to protect the regional trade with the Philippines from interference by the Dutch base in the south of the island. The colony was short-lived due to the loss of its strategic importance and unwillingness by Spanish authorities in Manila to commit more resources to its defense. After seventeen years, the last fortress of the Spanish was besieged by Dutch forces and eventually fell, giving the Dutch control over much of the island. ==Background== In 1566, the Dutch rebels rose against King Philip II in Hapsburg Netherlands. The Dutch Republic and its allies, England and France attacked and looted some of Spain's overseas territories, as part of the Eighty Years' War. The Spanish cut the Dutch rebels off from the spice trade based in Lisbon, making it necessary for the Dutch to send their own expeditions to the sources of these commodities to take control of the much desired spice trade in the East Indies. As a result of the Iberian Union of Portugal and Spain in 1580, the Dutch of the Seventeen Provinces fought the Dutch‚ÄìPortuguese War. Allies England and France became enemies of both Portugal and Spain. The Dutch colonization of Formosa was part of the unsuccessful campaign to seize the possessions of the Spanish Habsburgs in Asia, including the Philippines. The Dutch began to attack a string of often undermanned coastal fortresses that comprised the Habsburg's Portuguese African and Asian possessions. The settlements were sometimes isolated, difficult to reinforce if attacked, and prone to being picked off one by one. However, the Dutch were mostly unsuccessful in these attempts. Pursuing their quest for alternative routes to Asia for trade, the first Dutch privateer squadron to reach the Philippines on 14 December 1600 was led by pirate Olivier van Noort. The Dutch sought to dominate the commercial sea trade in Southeast Asia, often engaging in piracy and privateering. They attempted to disrupt trade by harassing the coasts of Manila Bay and its environs, and preyed on sampans and junks from China and Japan trading at Manila. In the context of this competition for trade, the Dutch established a colony at Tayouan, present-day Anping, in the south of Formosa. From there they tried threaten Spain's trade in the region. As a counter to this threat, the Spanish colonial authorities in Manila decided to establish their own colony in the north of the island. ==The early years (1626‚Äì1629)== Map of Spanish Empire (and Portuguese Empire) including Spanish Formosa Spanish Map of Keelung and Tamsui Harbor, 1626 Landing at Cape Santiago in the north-east of Formosa but finding it unsuitable for defensive purposes, the Spanish continued westwards along the coast until they arrived at Keelung. A deep and well-protected harbour plus a small island in the mouth of the harbour made it the ideal spot to build the first settlement, which they named Santissima Trinidad. Forts were built, both on the island and in the harbour itself. In 1629 the Spanish erected a second base, centered on Fort San Domingo, in Tamsui. ==First battle with the Dutch== In 1641, the Spanish colony in the north had become such an irritant to the Dutch in the south that they decided to take northern Formosa by force. This attempt would prove a failure. In courteous terms, the Dutch Governor Paulus Traudenius informed the Spanish governor of their intentions. The Spanish governor was not inclined to give in so easily and replied in kind. Subsequently, the Dutch launched an assault on the northern regions held by the Spanish, but the positions were well-defended and the attacking troops were not able to breach the walls of the fortresses. They returned, thwarted and humiliated, to the Dutch base at Fort Zeelandia. ==Second Battle with the Dutch== In 1642, the Spanish Governor of Manila recalled most of his Formosa troops for an expedition in the Philippines. In August that year, to profit from the relatively undefended Spanish position, the Dutch returned to Keelung with four large ships, several smaller ships, and approximately 369 Dutch soldiers. A combination of Spaniards, aboriginals, and Kapampangan from the Philippines held off the Dutch for six days. They eventually surrendered and were returned to Manila defeated, and giving up their flags and what little artillery remained with them. Sebasti√°n Hurtado de Corcuera, governor of the Philippines, was blamed for the loss of Formosa and was eventually tried in court for his actions. Upon conviction, he was imprisoned for five years in the Philippines. Historians since Corcuera's time have chastised him for the loss of the settlement in Formosa but other factors, such as limited resources in what was then a huge empire, were contributing factors. ==See also== *Dutch Formosa *Kingdom of Middag *Kingdom of Tungning *Spanish expedition to Formosa ==ReferencesBibliography== * Category:Spanish East Indies Category:Former colonies in Asia Category:Former Spanish colonies Spanish Formosa Category:1620s in the Spanish East Indies Category:1630s in the Spanish East Indies Category:1640s in the Spanish East Indies Category:New Spain Category:States and territories established in 1626 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1642 Category:1626 establishments in the Spanish East Indies Category:1626 establishments in New Spain Category:1642 disestablishments in New Spain Category:1626 establishments in Asia Category:1642 disestablishments in Asia ","title":"Spanish Formosa"},{"id":"19298003","text":"AudioFile may refer to: *AudioFile (company), a software company purchased by Delrina *AudioFile (magazine), a magazine that reviews audiobooks ==See also== *Audio file, format for storing digital audio content *Audiophile ","title":"AudioFile"},{"id":"19298040","text":"William Pattenden (31 October 1747 at East Peckham, Kent - 1817 at Hadlow, buried 2 April 1817 at East Peckham) was an English professional cricketer who played for Kent.

As a renowned advocate, he represented the interests of the preeminent Catalan families and served on the boards of many academic and commercial institutions.

From March 4 to October 25, 1899, he served as Minister of Justice in the cabinet of Francisco Silvela. ==Impact on Spanish law== Dur√°n y Bas adhered to Savigny's \\"historical\\" school of thought, maintaining that law ought to be a reflection of the \\"national spirit\\" as established in local customary law. Accordingly, he opposed the \\"philosophical\\" school dominant in 19th century Spain which sought to unify and codify the national law based on the principles of rationalism and natural law.

This is a fundamental result in absolute geometry because its proof does not depend upon the parallel postulate. In several high school treatments of geometry, the term \\"exterior angle theorem\\" has been applied to a different result, namely the portion of Proposition 1.32 which states that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the remote interior angles. This result, which depends upon Euclid's parallel postulate will be referred to as the \\"High school exterior angle theorem\\" (HSEAT) to distinguish it from Euclid's exterior angle theorem. Some authors refer to the \\"High school exterior angle theorem\\" as the strong form of the exterior angle theorem and \\"Euclid's exterior angle theorem\\" as the weak form. ==Exterior angles== A triangle has three corners, called vertices. The sides of a triangle (line segments) that come together at a vertex form two angles (four angles if you consider the sides of the triangle to be lines instead of line segments).One line segment is considered the initial side and the other the terminal side. The angle is formed by going counterclockwise from the initial side to the terminal side. The choice of which line segment is the initial side is arbitrary, so there are two possibilities for the angle determined by the line segments. Only one of these angles contains the third side of the triangle in its interior, and this angle is called an interior angle of the triangle.This way of defining interior angles does not presuppose that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. In the picture below, the angles ‚à†ABC, ‚à†BCA and ‚à†CAB are the three interior angles of the triangle. An exterior angle is formed by extending one of the sides of the triangle; the angle between the extended side and the other side is the exterior angle. In the picture, angle ‚à†ACD is an exterior angle. 465px ==Euclid's exterior angle theorem== The proof of Proposition 1.16 given by Euclid is often cited as one place where Euclid gives a flawed proof. Euclid proves the exterior angle theorem by: * construct the midpoint E of segment AC, * draw the ray BE, * construct the point F on ray BE so that E is (also) the midpoint of B and F, * draw the segment FC. By congruent triangles we can conclude that ‚à† BAC = ‚à† ECF and ‚à† ECF is smaller than ‚à† ECD, ‚à† ECD = ‚à† ACD therefore ‚à† BAC is smaller than ‚à† ACD and the same can be done for the angle ‚à† CBA by bisecting BC. The flaw lies in the assumption that a point (F, above) lies \\"inside\\" angle (‚à† ACD). No reason is given for this assertion, but the accompanying diagram makes it look like a true statement. When a complete set of axioms for Euclidean geometry is used (see Foundations of geometry) this assertion of Euclid can be proved. ===Invalid in Spherical geometry === Small triangles may behave in a nearly Euclidean manner, but the exterior angles at the base of the large triangle are 90¬∞, a contradiction to the Euclid's exterior angle theorem. The exterior angle theorem is not valid in spherical geometry nor in the related elliptical geometry. Consider a spherical triangle one of whose vertices is the North Pole and the other two lie on the equator. The sides of the triangle emanating from the North Pole (great circles of the sphere) both meet the equator at right angles, so this triangle has an exterior angle that is equal to a remote interior angle. The other interior angle (at the North Pole) can be made larger than 90¬∞, further emphasizing the failure of this statement. However, since the Euclid's exterior angle theorem is a theorem in absolute geometry it is automatically valid in hyperbolic geometry. == High school exterior angle theorem == The high school exterior angle theorem (HSEAT) says that the size of an exterior angle at a vertex of a triangle equals the sum of the sizes of the interior angles at the other two vertices of the triangle (remote interior angles). So, in the picture, the size of angle ACD equals the size of angle ABC plus the size of angle CAB. The HSEAT is logically equivalent to the Euclidean statement that the sum of angles of a triangle is 180¬∞. If it is known that the sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle is 180¬∞, then the HSEAT is proved as follows: :b + d = 180^\\\\circ :b + d = b + a + c :\\\\therefore d = a + c. On the other hand, if the HSEAT is taken as a true statement then: : d = a + c : b + d = 180^\\\\circ : \\\\therefore b + a + c = 180^\\\\circ. Illustration of proof of the HSEAT Proving that the sum of the measures of the angles of a triangle is 180¬∞. The Euclidean proof of the HSEAT (and simultaneously the result on the sum of the angles of a triangle) starts by constructing the line parallel to side AB passing through point C and then using the properties of corresponding angles and alternate interior angles of parallel lines to get the conclusion as in the illustration. The HSEAT can be extremely useful when trying to calculate the measures of unknown angles in a triangle. ==Notes References == * * * : (3 vols.): (vol. 1), (vol. 2), (vol. 3). * * * HSEAT references * Geometry Textbook - Standard IX, Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, Pune - 411 005, India. * Geometry Common Core, 'Pearson Education: Upper Saddle River, ¬©2010, pages 171-173  United States. * .

He was the eldest son of Henrietta Brocas and William Cary. Henrietta was the daughter of Theophilus Brocas, Dean of Killala and William, at the time, was a captain of the First Regiment of Foot. His grandfather, Henry Cary was archdeacon, and his great grandfather, Mordecai Cary, bishop of that diocese.Henry Cary, Memoir of the Rev. Henry Francis Cary M.A. (1847) Edward Moxon, Dover St, London. The Dante translation with Gustave Dor√© illustrations He was educated at Rugby School and at the grammar schools of Sutton Coldfield and Birmingham, as well as at Christ Church, Oxford, which he entered in 1790 and studied French and Italian literature. While at school he regularly contributed to the Gentleman's Magazine, and published a volume of Sonnets and Odes. He took holy orders and in 1797 and became vicar of Abbots Bromley in Staffordshire. He held this benefice until his death. In 1800 he also became vicar of Kingsbury in Warwickshire. At Christ Church he studied French and Italian literature, his command of which is evidenced in his notes to his translation of Dante. The version of the Inferno was published in 1805 together with the original text. Cary moved to London in 1808, where he became reader at the Berkeley Chapel and subsequently, lecturer at Chiswick and curate of the Savoy Chapel. His version of the whole Divina Commedia in blank verse appeared in 1814. It was published at Cary's own expense, as the publisher refused to undertake the risk, owing to the failure incurred over the Inferno. The translation was brought to the notice of Samuel Rogers by Thomas Moore. Rogers made some additions to an article on it by Ugo Foscolo in the Edinburgh Review. This article, and praise bestowed on the work by Coleridge in a lecture at the Royal Institution, led to a general acknowledgment of its merit. Cary's Dante gradually took its place among standard works, passing through four editions in his lifetime. In 1833, Cary was granted six months' leave of absence because of illness and travelled with his manservant and his son, Francis, to Italy visiting Amiens, Paris, Lyons, Aix, Nice, Mentone, Genoa, Pisa, Florence, Sienna, Rome (a month), Naples, Bologna, Verona, Venice (a month), Innsbruck, Munich, Nuremberg, Frankfurt, Cologne, Rotterdam, The Hague, Amsterdam, Brussels, Ghent, and Bruges. In 1824, Cary published a translation of The Birds of Aristophanes, and, about 1834, he published his translation of the Odes of Pindar. In 1826 he was appointed assistant-librarian in the British Museum, a post that he held for about eleven years. He resigned because the appointment of keeper of the printed books, which should have been his in the ordinary course of promotion, was refused to him when it fell vacant. In 1841 a crown pension of ¬£200 a year, obtained through the efforts of Samuel Rogers, was conferred on him. Cary's Lives of the early French Poets, and Lives of English Poets (from Samuel Johnson to Henry Kirke White), intended as a continuation of Johnson's Lives of the Poets, were published in collected form in 1846. He died in Charlotte St., St. George's, Bloomsbury, London, in 1844 and was buried in Poets' Corner, Westminster Abbey. A memoir was published by his son, Judge Henry Cary, in 1847. Another son, Francis Stephen Cary, became a well-known art teacher, succeeding Henry Sass as the head of his art academy in London. ==See also== * English translations of Homer: Henry Francis Cary * List of Gibraltarians ==References External links == * * * Cary's translation of Dante side by side with those of Longfellow and Norton Category:1772 births Category:1844 deaths Category:Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford Category:Italian‚ÄìEnglish translators Category:Translators of Dante Alighieri Category:English essayists Category:English translators Category:People educated at Rugby School Category:Burials at Westminster Abbey Category:Gibraltarians Category:Employees of the British Museum Category:Male essayists Category:English male poets ","title":"Henry Francis Cary"},{"id":"19298419","text":"Kalinikos Kreanga (born March 8, 1972) is a Greek (formerly Romanian) table tennis player.

In 1919, she was sold to Belgium and renamed Persier. Between 1934 and 1941 she also held a passenger certificate. She was driven ashore on the Icelandic coast in a storm in February 1941 which put her out of action for two years. Returned to service in February 1943, she served until 11 February 1945, when she was torpedoed and sunk by with the loss of 20 crew. ==Description== The ship was built as yard number 248 in 1918 by Northumberland Shipbuilding Ltd, Newcastle-on-Tyne, Northumberland. She was completed in June 1918. The ship was long, with a beam of . She had a depth of and a draught of . She was assessed at , . The ship was propelled by a triple expansion steam engine, which had cylinders of , and diameter by stroke. The engine was built by North East Marine Engine Co (1938) Ltd, Newcastle upon Tyne. It produced 517nhp. It could propel the ship at . ==History== War Buffalo was built for the British Shipping Controller. Her port of registry was London and she was operated under the management of Ranking, Gilmour & Co Ltd. In 1919, she was sold to Lloyd Royal Belge SA, Antwerp and renamed Persier, The Code Letters MPDI were allocated. She was the second Lloyd Royal Belge ship to bear that name. On 19 January 1922, Persier rescued five crew from the Newfoundland-registered schooner Eileen Lake, which foundered in the Atlantic Ocean west of Newfoundland. In 1930, Lloyd Royal Belge was merged with the Compagnie Maritime Belge du Congo to form Compagnie Maritime Belge SA. Persier was operated under the management of Agence Maritime Internationale. In 1934, her Code letters were changed to OOZA. Lloyd's Register shows that the ship held a passenger certificate from that date. In May 1940, Persier took part in Operation Dynamo. On 28 October 1940, Persier departed Halifax, Nova Scotia as a member of Convoy HX 84. She was carrying a cargo of steel destined of Hull. In December 1940, she was anchored at Oban, Argyllshire when an air raid was carried out by Heinkel He 111 bombers based at Stavanger, Norway. Two bombs fell astern of Persia. A Dutch ship, the was sunk. Although it was not realised at the time, Persier had been damaged in the raid, and some leaks were discovered during her next voyage, which was across the Atlantic. Her destination was Baltimore, Maryland. Once she was fully loaded, further damage was discovered and repairs had to be made, which left her straggling behind her convoy. On 28 February 1941, Persier was battered by a storm, with a hatch cover being ripped off and the steering and electrical systems failing. She was stranded east off Vik in Myrdalur, Iceland and was severely damaged. Persier was refloated in April, and towed to Reykjav√≠k by the tug Aegir for initial repairs to be made. On 9 June, Persier was taken to the Kleppsvik Strand, but broke her back as she was insufficiently supported, and was subsequently beached. On 8 February 1942, she was refloated and re-beached, finally being refloated on 20 May. She was towed by the tugs Empire Bascobel and Empire Larch to a Tyneside shipyard for repairs, which were completed in February 1943. Persiers first voyage on return to service was from Liverpool to New York, United States as a member of Convoy ON 169. Departing on 22 February, the convoy arrived on 21 March. In September 1943, Persier was a member of Convoy SC 141, which departed Halifax, Nova Scotia on 3 September, and arrived at Liverpool on 17 September. She was carrying a cargo of steel and woodpulp and was bound for London. In 1944, Persier was selected to be one of the blockships when Operation Overlord, the invasion of France took place. Although she was prepared for scuttling, the decision was later reversed and she was refitted and returned to service. On 8 February 1945 Persier began her final voyage as part of Convoy BTC 65, setting off from Cardiff to take food to the liberated but starving people of Belgium. Carrying the convoy's Commodore, Persier was carrying a cargo consisting 2,400 tons soup, 1,400 tons dried eggs, 1,000 tons meat and 20 tons of general cargo. On 11 February 1945 Persier was off the Eddystone Lighthouse when she was hit by one of three torpedoes fired by . The ship developed a list to port and began to sink by the bows. One of the lifeboats was swamped and another was driven into the propeller, which was still turning. Twenty of the 51 crew, 8 naval personnel and four stowaways were killed. The British coasters Birker Force and Gem rescued seven and 20 people respectively. rescued 16 people.

Supervised by Howard Lentner, his doctoral dissertation was on \\"State-Building and Regime Security: A Study of Iraq's Decision-Making Process during the 1991 Second Gulf War\\". In 1997, he was a Post-doctoral Scholar at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies of Harvard University working with Roger Owen, and in 1998 was appointed Research Associate at the Ralph Bunche Institute on the United Nations in New York, then directed by Benjamin Rivlin.

An expanded and revised version retitled Understanding Al Qaeda: Changing War and Global Politics was released in 2011. Reviews of the book highlighted its innovative nature, \\"refreshing and rational\\" approach, and sharp language reminiscent of critical theorist Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek. Columbia University's Mahmood Mamdani has noted that \\"Mohamedou provides a much-needed secular understanding of Al Qaeda. Unlike most writers, he insists on understanding the changing significance of Al Qaeda's discourse against a historical backdrop\\", while Emory University's Abdullahi An-Naim pointed out Mohamedou's \\"sober analysis\\" as \\"essential reading\\". One reviewer noted that: \\"[Mohamedou] has presented an entirely new perspective on the subject. This makes the book a must read, for scholars as well as students of international politics.\\" Indeed, Mohamedou's insistence on treating Al Qaeda as a political rather than religious group has led to his characterization as \\"perhaps the first liberal to attempt a fully secular understanding of Al Qaeda\\". In 2017, Mohamedou expanded his analysis of Al Qaeda by examining the case of the Islamic State in A Theory of ISIS: Political Violence and the Transformation of the Global Order. Published by Pluto Press in the United Kingdom and by the University of Chicago Press in the United States, this book offered the first full academic conceptualization and historicization of ISIS. Professor Hamid Dabashi of Columbia University called it \\"a ground-breaking work of political theory.\\" {{cite webhttps://www.plutobooks.com/9781786801708/a-theory-of-isis/ Reviews of the book noted that \\"Mohamedou's work fills a gap... [and] his critical outlook on the existent literature on IS provides a novel take on the emergence and decline of the group. Mohamedou provides a unique, historically contextualized vantage point from which to understand the reasons for the rise of IS... a significant contribution to terrorism research.\\",{{cite webhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17539153.2018.1492187. Others pointed out the book as a \\"refreshingly nuanced text...[an] essential reading to anyone who wishes to understand the ISIS phenomenon beyond the day-to-day military and national security thinking which has come to dominate much discussion regarding the group...This forcing of thought and reflection is Mohamedou‚Äôs greatest strength\\" {{cite weburl=http://middleeastreviewsonline.com/membr_review/theory-isis-political- violence-transformation-global-order/. Mohamedou \\"offers a convincing take on the genesis, nature, and trajectory of what was for a time the most powerful terrorist group in the world. In doing so, [he] brings the social sciences into a conceptualization of the so-called Islamic State, beyond its specific geopolitical and radical Islamist nature.\\"{{cite webhttps://carnegie- mec.org/diwan/76391?lang=en. Mohamedou is also the author of Iraq and the Second Gulf War: State-Building and Regime Security. Originally published in 1998 by Austin & Winfeld in San Francisco and reprinted in 2002, that book has been considered \\"a model for further studies on the Gulf War\\". In French, Mohamedou wrote Contre-Croisade: Origines et Cons√©quences du 11 Septembre, an in-depth investigation of the events leading up to and after the September 11 attacks, which was published by l'Harmattan in Paris in 2004 and reissued in 2011 under the title Contre-Croisade: Le 11 Septembre et le Retournement du Monde. An Arabic version was published in 2010. He has contributed chapters to other books, notably The Handbook of Political Science: A Global Perspective (Sage, 2020) The Routledge Handbook of South-South Relations (Routledge, 2019), Orientalismes/Occidentalismes: A Propos de L'Oeuvre d'Edward Said (Hermann, 2018), The UN and the Global South, 1945 and 2015 (Routledge, 2017), Minding the Gap: African Conflict Management in a Time of Change (CIGI, 2016), La Guerre au Mali (La D√©couverte, 2013), The Role of the Arab-Islamic World in the Rise of the West (Palgrave, 2012), Violent Non-State Actors in Contemporary World Politics (Columbia University Press, 2010), Rethinking the Foreign Policies of the Global South ‚Äì Seeking Conceptual Frameworks (Lynne Reinner, 2003), and Governance, and Democratization in the Middle East (Avebury Press, 1998). He has published journal articles in the Third World Quarterly, the Harvard Human Rights Journal, Relations Internationales, La Revue Internationale et Strategique, Esprit, The Muslim World, Europe's World, and The Buffalo Human Rights Review, Among his most influential works is a study on the mutation of the modern forms of war and the rise of transnational terrorism published by Harvard University in 2005 entitled \\"Non-Linearity of Engagement\\", from which an op-ed was derived and published in The New York Times and The Boston Globe. Updating Martin Van Creveld's 1991 \\"The Transformation of War\\" and Herfried Munkler's 2005 \\"The New Wars\\", Mohamedou's work has been hailed as one of the latter-day most insightful and detached scientific analysis of Al Qaeda, examining in particular the mechanics of its regionalization, franchising, away of what he termed a 'mother Al Qaeda' (Al Qaeda al Oum), and assessing the long-term impact of the new forms of terrorism, 'the militarization of Islamism', and the post-modern and post- colonial nature of ISIS. Mohamedou has also written on democratization issues in other media including Le Monde Le Monde Diplomatique; and Lib√©ration appeared on BBC World News, BBC2, Al Jazeera, Al Jazeera English, Voice of America, Radio France Internationale, France 2, France3, France 24 Deutsche Welle, VPRO, Swiss television, Swiss Radio, NECN and ABC News, and has been a guest-blogger on \\"The Washington Note\\" writing on post-9/11 US policy and American society, and the Arab Spring. A regular public speaker,http://www.culture-rencontre.ch/conferences/actu0411.pdf Mohamedou served on the advisory council of the Dart Center for Journalism and Adviser to the Small Arms Survey. ==Awards== In May 2016, New African magazine named Mohamedou among the 50 influential African intellectuals. In November 2017, the College de France awarded Mohamedou its recognition prize at the occasion of a lecture he delivered at the Amphith√©√¢tre Marguerite de Navarre-Marcelin Berthelot in Paris, France. ==Documentary== In December 2018, the television news channel Al Jazeera premiered a documentary entitled Rethinking Extremism{{cite webhttps://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/radicalised- youth/radicalised-youth.html. in which the work of Mohamedou is showcased. Directed by Dan Davies of Blackleaf Films, the 26-minute documentary travels around the world with Mohamedou as he meets with scholars, experts, and students to discuss the question of violent extremism. In the documentary, Mohamedou offers a critical look at the securitizing logic at play globally since 9/11, and specifically the police state surveillance architecture and construction of terrorism/violent extremism.{{cite webhttps://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/deciphering-extremism- narrative-181218142318869.html ==Notable works== *A Theory of ISIS: Political Violence and the Transformation of the Global Order (University of Chicago Press and Pluto Press, 2017)http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/T/bo27405381.html *Understanding Al Qaeda: Changing War and Global Politics (Pluto Press, London 2011) *Iraq and the Second Gulf War: State-Building and Regime Security (Austin and Winfeld, San Francisco 2002) *Democratisation in the 21st Century (Routledge, London 2016) *Contre-Croisade: Le 11 Septembre et le Retournement du Monde (L'Harmattan, Paris 2011) *The Rise and Fall of Al Qaeda (2011) *Non- Linearity of Engagement (Harvard University 2005)http://www.hpcrresearch.org/sites/default/files/publications/Non- Linearity_of_Engagement.pdf *The Challenge of Transnational Non-State Armed Groups (Harvard University 2007) ==Other articles== *Harvard Human Rights Journal 20th anniversary special issue *Harvard Human Rights Journal *Harvard Gazette *The Muslim Word *Le Monde *Lib√©ration *Terrorism.net ==References== Category:Living people Category:Mauritanian diplomats Category:Mauritanian political scientists Category:Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies faculty Category:Harvard University faculty Category:1968 births Category:Foreign ministers of Mauritania Category:People from Adrar Region ","title":"Mohamed Mahmoud Ould Mohamedou"},{"id":"19298510","text":"Thomas Oswald Graham (12 May 1886 ‚Äì 29 April 1933) was an Australian rules footballer who played with University in the Victorian Football League (VFL). ==ReferencesSources== *Holmesby, Russell & Main, Jim (2007).

It was held on 26 October 2008 on the Surfers Paradise Street Circuit in Queensland, Australia. It was the first time the race was held for the Indy Racing League after 17 years as a Champ Car race. The race did not count towards the 2008 IndyCar season points as the race date was held after the Chicagoland Speedway 300, which was preset as the season finale prior to the merger of Champ Car and IRL. The previous non-points race had been the 1992 Marlboro Challenge, a CART all-star race. The race was won by an Australian driver for the first time in the 18-year history of the event with Ryan Briscoe winning for Team Penske after leading much of the race, while pushed hard by the near-local, New Zealander Scott Dixon. Ryan Hunter-Reay emerged from an entertaining dice to complete the podium in third position. ==Team changes== With the championship decided, some teams used the race as a prelude to the 2009 season. Dario Franchitti made his return to IndyCar after a failed attempt at breaking into NASCAR, taking Dan Wheldon's seat at Chip Ganassi Racing, with Wheldon moving on to his 2009 team, Panther Racing, replacing V√≠tor Meira. Meira moved to his new team, A. J. Foyt Enterprises. ==Qualifying== Rain fell on early parts of qualifying which caught several cars out, most notably Danica Patrick who hit the wall on her out lap wrecking the nose of the car and putting her out of qualifying without a lap recorded. The rain stopped fairly early and Ryan Hunter-Reay made best fist of the conditions, topping Group 1 two and a half tenths of a second clear of Alex Tagliani. The group was well spaced with V√≠tor Meira and E. J. Viso almost a second behind the top two and well clear of the final two cars to advance, Mario Moraes and Ryan Briscoe. Graham Rahal missed the cut by less than two- tenths of a second with Oriol Servi√† the other car unlucky to miss out. Will Power continued to show the pace he hadd shown through practice to top the second group, almost four second faster the Group 1 as the track dried. Tony Kanaan shadowed the local hero with Justin Wilson within a tenth of Kanaan. Scott Dixon and returning teammate Dario Franchitti progressed while again a Penske car sat on the bubble, H√©lio Castroneves the last car to make it into Group 2. Marco Andretti was well down on Castroneves while Dan Wheldon made a troubled debut for his new team, missing the cut by almost two seconds. Dixon topped Section 2 track times improving from over 1:50 to 1:39.2049 for Dixon's best lap. Castroneves improved to second ahead of Kanaan, who would subsequently lose his bets lap and drop out of the top six, Franchitti and Briscoe. Power having led much of the session stopped early and had a nervous wait as his time was rapidly bettered, but made it through with Hunter-Reay joining the Firestone Fast Six. Dixon, Power and Briscoe swapped top times early until Power started to dominate. With time running out Dixon recorded a 1:35.7672, the fastest lap time recorded in all of qualifying with Briscoe and Franchitti filling the top three when on his last lap Power backed off and found something for a last charge, recording a 1:34.9451, smashing the Fast Six field by eight-tenths of a second. ===Qualifying results=== {  style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" - !

Will Power immediately dominated the start, pulling a two-second lead on the first lap. Scott Dixon started second but after being forced to cut the first chicane was relegated behind Ryan Briscoe by the officials. Mario Moraes and V√≠tor Meira clashed at the second chicane with Meira spinning without hitting anyone. A few lap later Moraes caused the first safety car, clipping the turn 2 chicane, breaking the right rear corner of the car. Townsend Bell was eliminated after a clash with Helio Castroneves which wrecked Bell's steering. Later the same lap Castroneves had a right rear puncture caused by Danica Patrick's front wing while passing the Andretti Green Racing driver. Lap 17 saw the end of Power's dominance of the meeting as he crashed at the Bartercard chicane, which put Briscoe into the lead ahead of Dixon. Briscoe pitted for fuel immediately upon catching backmarker Patrick, but Dixon waited another lap and was held up behind her. At the same time Graham Rahal touched the rear of Car 20, spinning the Vision Racing car at the bottom corner and Ed Carpenter stopped as well, almost blocking the track. The emerging safety car almost hit Dixon as he completed his stop. Behind the safety car Patrick stopped and stalled, almost hitting the stationary car of Carpenter. Dario Franchitti clipped the tyre bundle on the inside of the same chicane and spun and stalled bringing out the safety car. After the restart Tony Kanaan had the right rear suspension break without apparent reason. After the second round of pitstops the battle for third between Alex Tagliani and Ryan Hunter-Reay was interrupted by Dario Franchitti as poor pitstop and a poor pit position for Conquest Racing saw Tagliani drop several position behind EJ Viso. Viso later would twice have to give up spots for cutting chicanes, first to Tagliani, then Castroneves. Lap 48 saw Jaime Camara go straight on and stalled the car attempting to recover. In the races closing stages Dixon closed in on Briscoe, the two remaining local drivers lapping significantly faster than the rest of the field. Ed Carpenter hit the wall at turn 3 on the last lap but it did not affect the lead battle and Briscoe won his home race ahead of Dixon. Ryan Hunter-Reay finished third. ===Race result=== Final results sourced from:. {  style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" - ! Pos !! No !! Driver !! Team !! Laps !! Time/Retired !!

Early people believed this creature is so big that it can swallow (or cover) the sun to explain the occurrence of eclipses. It is even described as a giant bird named Minokawa that lives in outer space which can devour the sun and the moon, and would try to do the same with the earth. In a Bagobo tale, the Minokawa is a bird as large as an island. Its feathers are those of sharp swords, the eyes reflect like mirrors, its beak and legs are like steel. It lives \\"outside the sky, at the eastern horizon\\". While the Baua lived \\"above the sky\\" because the Visayans believe that there is a cave called \\"calulundan\\" above the sky, the entrance covered by blue smoke. ==Basic Legend== Before time began, very long ago, a great bird called Minokawa swallowed the moon. Seized with fear, all the people began to scream and made great noises. Then the bird peeped down to see what the matter was, and opened his mouth. But as soon as he opened his mouth, the moon sprang out and ran away. The Minokawa-bird is as large as the Island of Negros or Bohol. It has a beak of steel, and his claws too are of steel. His eyes are mirrors, and each single feather is a sharp sword. He lives outside the sky, at the eastern horizon, ready to seize the moon and after the unsuccessful attempt of swallowing the satellite, it journeys and haunts again lurking under the earth. The moon makes eight holes in the eastern horizon to come out of, and eight holes in the western horizon to go into, because every day the big bird tries to catch her, and she is afraid. The exact moment he tries to swallow her is just when she is about to come in through one of the holes in the east to shine on us again. If the Minokawa should swallow the moon, and the sun too, he would then come down to earth and gulp down men also. But when the moon is in the belly of the big bird, and the sky is dark, then all the Bagobo people will scream and cry, and beat gongs, because they fear they will all be eaten. Soon this racket makes the Minokawa- bird look down and \\"open his mouth to hear the sound.\\" Then the moon jumps out of the bird's mouth and runs away. ==Popular culture== In the Bagani (TV series), Minokawa is one of Apo's creatures. Later, it was under Lakas' control, which it merged with his sword. He uses the bird for flight or fighting. ==References== Category:Visayan mythology Category:Philippine legendary creatures Category:Legendary birds Category:Austronesian spirituality ","title":"Minokawa"},{"id":"19298611","text":"Northern Subdivision may refer to: *Northern Subdivision (Pennsylvania), formerly B&O; *Northern Subdivision (CSX), formerly C&O;, connecting Kentucky to Columbus, Ohio ","title":"Northern Subdivision"},{"id":"19298614","text":"Thea Stabell (born 4 July 1939), n√©e Dorothea Jessie Pierstorff, is a Norwegian actress.

It also had several branches to the coal mines of the Hocking Valley near Athens. The company became part of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway system in 1910, and the line between Toledo and Columbus continues to see trains as CSX Transportation's Columbus Subdivision. Portions of the main line south of Columbus are now operated by the Indiana and Ohio Railway and Hocking Valley Scenic Railway. At the end of 1925, HV operated 349 miles of road on 881 miles of track; that year it reported 2614 million ton-miles of revenue freight and 25 million passenger-miles. ==History== The earliest predecessor of the Hocking Valley was the Mineral Railroad, incorporated in April 1864 to build from Athens in the rich Hocking Valley to Columbus. The company changed its name to the Columbus and Hocking Valley Railroad in June 1867, shortly after construction began at Columbus, and the line opened for business from Columbus to Lancaster on January 20, 1869, Logan on August 28, 1869, Nelsonville on September 17, 1869, and Athens on July 25, 1870. The first branch, from Logan east to New Straitsville, was completed in January 1871, and the railroad completed a cutoff from Nelsonville north alongside Monday Creek to the Straitsville Branch in 1880. Several more branches reached additional mines in the Logan- Nelsonville area, including along Snow Fork (initially incorporated in July 1875 as the Snow Fork Valley Railroad) to Orbiston (1877), Murray City (1882), and Coalgate (1893), and along Brush Fork to New Pittsburg (1877-78).Interstate Commerce Commission, 29 Val. Rep. 321 (1929), Valuation Docket No. 904: Hocking Valley Railway Company et al. The Columbus and Toledo Railroad was incorporated in May 1872 to connect its namesake cities on an eastern route through Delaware, Marion, Upper Sandusky, and Fostoria. Construction, delayed by the Panic of 1873, began in August 1875, and the line was opened from Columbus to Marion on November 1, 1876, and the rest of the way to Walbridge, outside Toledo, on January 11, 1877. Trackage rights were acquired over the Toledo and Woodville Railroad (a Pennsylvania Railroad subsidiary) to reach Toledo, including a dock on the Maumee River to handle Hocking Valley coal and iron ore. The final piece of the system was incorporated in March 1870 as the Gallipolis, McArthur and Columbus Railroad, which would build from Gallipolis on the Ohio River to Logan. It acquired part of an incomplete roadbed graded in the 1850s by the Scioto and Hocking Valley Railroad between Hamden and Logan, but was unable to survive the Panic of 1873. The Columbus and Gallipolis Railway, incorporated in July 1876, tried to complete the line on an extended route to Columbus, but ran out of funds, and yet another company, the Ohio and West Virginia Railway, was incorporated in May 1878 to continue construction. The north end was moved back to Logan a year later, and construction began in July 1879, now allied with the Columbus and Hocking Valley. Operation over the full route commenced on October 15, 1880, and a branch alongside the river to Pomeroy was completed in January 1881. The three companies merged in August 1881 to form the Columbus, Hocking Valley and Toledo Railway, which stretched across the state from Toledo to Pomeroy. A short extension near Toledo was built in 1890, connecting to the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway (a New York Central Railroad subsidiary) at Rockwell Junction. The new company entered receivership in February 1897 and was reorganized in February 1899 as the Hocking Valley Railway, which came under the control of a syndicate in December 1902. The stock was distributed among several railroad companies in June 1903, with one- third going to the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Pennsylvania Railroad) and one-sixth each to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;), Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway (New York Central Railroad), and Erie Railroad. The C&O; gained control in March 1910, and initially used the Kanawha and Michigan Railway to make the connection from Charleston, but in 1917 it opened the first piece of the Northern Subdivision, which joined the main line at Limeville with Norfolk and Western Railway trackage rights to Columbus, and in 1927 a separate line to Columbus was completed. When the C&O; acquired control of the Pere Marquette Railway in 1929, the Hocking Valley served as its connection to the rest of the system. Finally, the Hocking Valley was merged into the C&O; in April 1930. A small branch railroad was organized in 1903 as the Athens, Amesville and Chauncey Railway. Its trackage was 3.65 miles in 1907, and 5.99 miles in 1908. It was built expressly to service coal mines in the Sugar Creek valley north of Athens, Ohio, and connected to the Hocking Valley Railway mainline just northwest of Athens. It was built by coal interests, but operated by the Hocking Valley Railway, and was merged into it in 1911. This line never ventured anywhere near Amesville or Chauncey, and did not even technically connect to Athens. After the merger, it was known as the Sugar Creek Branch. ==See also== *Crush, Texas ==References== * Category:Defunct Ohio railroads Category:Former Class I railroads in the United States Category:Predecessors of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Category:Railway companies established in 1899 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1930 Category:1899 establishments in Ohio ","title":"Hocking Valley Railway"},{"id":"19298700","text":"Concordia Lutheran High School is a private Christian high school located in Tomball, Texas, in Northwest Houston.

An expansion began construction in late March 2015, and was scheduled for completion in March 2016. In addition to classroom space this wing was to have classrooms, an art room, a green room, and four science laboratories. As of January 2017 the school had about 600 students. Around that month a 13 classroom wing was completed for $5.9 million, expanding the school's capacity. ==Campuses== The school has two campuses, a main campus and a south campus.

It was released on Mint Records in 2005. ==Critical reception== David Bernard of PopMatters said, \\"The hooks are plentiful, the arrangements are varied, the melodies are memorable and immediate, and the horns are tastefully implemented... With so many highlights, it remains difficult to criticize the more mediocre tracks because they would sound amazing on other releases when sandwiched between other mediocre tracks. An album rich with perfection can have a minor slip-up every once and a while.

Corr (born 25 January 1934) is an Irish former Fine Gael politician and retired secondary school teacher and former principal of South Presentation school. Corr was a member of Cork City Council from 1973 to 2014. He was first co-opted to the council (then called Cork Corporation) in 1973, and elected at the 1974 local elections. He was Lord Mayor of Cork in 1979 and 1996. When the five-seat Cork South-Central constituency was created in 1980, Fine Gael's support was sufficient for two seats. Peter Barry was the party's senior Teachta D√°la (TD); Corr had a rivalry with Hugh Coveney for the second Fine Gael seat. Coveney narrowly beat Corr at the 1981 general election, but Corr won by a larger margin in February 1982. Becoming disillusioned with D√°il politics, Corr stood aside in November 1982, with Coveney regaining the seat. Corr was to stand as a third Fine Gael candidate at the 1987 general election, but stood aside to avoid splitting the Fine Gael vote, though Coveney lost his seat in any event. Corr was unsuccessful at the 1989 and 1992 general elections. Corr was unhappy that John Cushnahan was selected ahead of him as Fine Gael candidate in Munster at the 1989 European Parliament election. Corr stood unsuccessfully in Munster at the 1999 European Parliament election. Corr taught geography, and wrote a school textbook in 1972. He spent six years working in Africa. He was a trade union activist, and considered on the left wing of Fine Gael in the early 1980s. He was appointed to the Board of Bord G√°is in 1997.

The real transliterated surname is \\"Ng\\" ===  Xiao Gu *Portrayed by Chen Liping *Occupation: Food Restaurant Operator *Appeared in: Episode 1-30 Xiao Gu, whose real name is Su Lifang (Ëãè‰∏ΩËä≥), is the matriarch of the family. A native of Kedah in Malaysia, she came to Singapore before the series started, and married Ah Shun. Together, they sold cooked foods for a living. Later, Ah Shun died of a grave, unspecified illness, and left Xiao Gu juggling with three small children, as well as the responsibility for their livelihood. Eventually, Xiao Gu expanded her food operation to a roadside stall. Xiao Gu, in accordance with her late husband's wishes, named the stall \\"Happy Restaurant\\" (Âπ∏Á¶èÈ£ØÂ∫ó). Xiao Gu eventually met her second husband, Ah Jin, after he saved her life in a dangerous situation. Xiao Gu and Ah Jin eventually grew close, and decides to get married. However, it was later revealed that Ah Jin, who claims to be a sailor, was a thief who, along with two other people, perpetrated the largest Jewelry Store robbery since Singaporean Independence. Ah Jin's whereabouts was eventually tipped off by Xiao Gu's son, Kaijie, and Ah Jin was surrounded by police on his wedding day with Xiao Gu. Ah Jin chose to commit suicide rather than be arrested. Xiao Gu eventually expanded her food business, and by 1995, Happy Restaurant became a moderately famous restaurant in Singapore. Xiao Gu also bought a food bazaar and a coffee shop to further expand her business empire. However, the money that was used to expand her empire was ill-gotten: they were the proceeds from Ah Jin's stolen jewelry. Moments before Ah Jin killed himself, he secretly told Xiao Gu where the jewelry was stashed, and Xiao Gu later stole the jewelry. Towards the end of the series, Xiao Gu realized that these ill-gotten wealth caused her sons and daughters untold misery, so she decided to sell off all her businesses, and restart her business elsewhere. Ah Shun *Portrayed by Yang Xinquan *Occupation: Food Business Operator *Appeared in: Episode 1 (Flashback) Ah Shun is only seen in flashbacks. He married Xiao Gu at an unspecified time, and together, they sold cooked foods for a living. Ah Shun suffered from a grave, but unspecified illness before the start of the series, and consequently died. He has connections to the local triads, as his friend, Ah Cheng, helped him out with medical costs. KaidaThe character's name is shown within the series to be transliterated in a dialect other than Mandarin. The real English name is shown to be \\"Kay Tuck\\" *Portrayed by Tan Yong Ming (Child), Chew Chor Meng (Adult) *Occupation: Student (Episode 1-6), Doctor (Episode 7-20), Mental Hospital Patient/Unemployed (Episode 21 onwards) *Appeared in: Episode 1-30 Kaida is one of the most academically inclined member of the family, eventually attending medical school and becoming a doctor. Personally, he was on good terms with Jinlong, who, since his father's suicide, harboured misgivings against the Huangs. Jinfeng's eventual murder by Kaijie, and Kaida's role in the eventual cover-up, caused him great emotional stress, and drove him to a mental breakdown, which cost Kaida his medical practice, and his girlfriend, Shimin. After his mental breakdown, Kaida helped out Xiao Gu with her restaurant operations, but he did little in his line of work, and spent much time watching television (just as Jinfeng did when she was helping out Xiao Gu). KaijieThe character's name is shown within the series to be transliterated in a dialect other than Mandarin. The real English name is shown to be \\"Kay Kiat\\" *Portrayed by Ma Weihan (Youth), Tay Ping Hui (Adult) *Occupation: Student (Episode 1-6), Lawyer (in internship) (Episode 7-??), Police Officer, Lawyer *Appeared in: Episode 1-30 Kaijie is the main villain in the series. Cunning but financially inclined, he became a lawyer, despite neglecting his academic studies during his youth. He despised the Jins, as he believed Ah Jin's criminal past brought shame to the Huangs. In the subsequent years, he made a small fortune in financial and property transactions, and eventually bought an apartment flat, which he used to house Jinfeng when she escaped from the Huangs. Jinfeng and Kaijie eventually developed an affair, and Jinfeng was made pregnant by Kaijie. Desperate to hide this hideous fact, and determined to gain the love and trust of Lin Fei (who comes from a wealthy family), he pushed Jinfeng overboard during a yacht trip. Jinfeng fell into a coma and eventually succumbed to her injuries. KaiqiThe character's name is shown within the series to be transliterated in a dialect other than Mandarin. The real English name is shown to be \\"Kiat Ghee\\" *Portrayed by Lao Yuting (Youth), Joanne Peh (Adult) *Occupation: Student (Episode 1-20), Broadcast Journalist (Episode 21 onwards) *Appeared in: Episode 1-30 Kaiqi is the youngest member of the Huang family. A justice-minded individual since her youth, she eventually became a broadcast journalist. She is the only person in her family (perhaps beside Kaida) who can get through to the hotheaded and stubborn Jinlong. Despite her unlucky streak in romance during her University days, she eventually married David (portrayed by Nat Ho), who is a dentist. ===Jin Family=== Ah Jin *Portrayed by Li Nanxing *Occupation: Sailor (claimed), Fugitive Robber (actual) *Appeared in: Episode 1-6 The personal history of Ah Jin is not well known, although he claims he is a sailor, which means he is away from his family for long periods of time. However, the claim is fake, as Ah Jin is actually a robber who participated in the largest jewelry store since Singaporean Independence. His accomplices also killed a few police officers, as well as a gravely injured accomplice. Ah Jin, as well as the surviving accomplice, buried the jewelry obtained from the heist in an undisclosed location and went into hiding, as arrest would almost certainly mean death (Singaporean law allows Death Penalty). He saved Xiao Gu from almost certain death, and the two grew close together after Ah Jin moved into Xiao Gu's apartment complex. When the two decided to get married, Kaijie, determined not to allow Ah Jin to do so, dug up Ah Jin's criminal past, and tipped off his whereabouts to police. When Ah Jin was surrounded by police, he committed suicide, rather than letting the police arrest him. However, before he died, he told Xiao Gu the whereabouts of the stashed jewelry, which allowed Xiao Gu to dig up the jewelry and eventually use them to finance her business.

The game was redesigned by Stephen Landrum. The trilogy was ported to 16-bit computers by Westwood Studios. These versions feature mouse controls and room descriptions within the game instead of the manual. ==Release== In 1985, Epyx published the remake Temple of Apshai Trilogy for Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit computers, Apple II, Thomson TO MO computers, and IBM PC, listed at a price of $29.95. The title contains an improved version of the original with Upper Reaches of Apshai and Curse of Ra on a single disk, featuring 12 dungeon levels and 568 rooms total. It was created by Stephen Landrum. A Macintosh version of Temple of Apshai Trilogy was also advertised a month later. In the following year, it appeared on Amiga and Atari ST. The Amiga, Atari ST and Macintosh versions were ported by Westwood Studios. Company co-founder Louis Castle stated in an interview with Computer & Video Games that his studio wanted to change the gameplay to real-time, but this was rejected by the publisher. The 16-bit versions introduced a new mouse-controlled interface where commands are selected from pull-down menus, but could also be controlled with the keyboard. The room descriptions are contained in the program here, and can also be accessed through a menu. In 1987, Temple of Apshai Trilogy was adapted to the Amstrad CPC and Thomson TO by d3M Software and published in France with the title La Trilogie Du Temple D'Apshai. ==Reception== Gregg Pearlman for Antic said \\"The Temple of Apshai Trilogy is essentially an enjoyable game, among the most popular of its genre. Many of the elements are interesting and imaginative.\\" Ervin Bobo for Commodore Power/Play said \\"good games never die. They either become classics as they are, or are improved upon at a later date. The Temple of Apshai Trilogy proves they can do both.\\" Patrick J. Kelley for ANALOG Computing said \\"So, if you're the armchair- barbarian type, come on in. You have nothing to lose but . . .\\" Compute!'s Gazette in 1986 called Temple of Apshai Trilogy for the Commodore 64 \\"a classic series of computer games made even better\\", stating that improved graphics and game play made it worthwhile even for those who had played them before. Amiga World criticized the Amiga version of Trilogys repetitiveness, stating that \\"unless you are very easily amused you will probably lose interest fairly soon\\". Bill Kunkel, Arnie Katz and Joyce Worley for Analog Computing, on the other hand, listed Trilogy as one of the best Atari ST games of 1986, lauded the improved graphics and interface, while asserting that \\"the actual content is timeless\\". In Dragon #114's \\"The Role of Computers\\" column in 1986, reviewers Hartley and Pattie Lesser also stated that the game was \\"well-worth your interest.\\" Info gave the Amiga version four-plus stars out of five, stating that the trilogy \\"has been admirably Amiga-tized\\". The magazine approved of the graphics, sound, and user interface and concluded that the game would be \\"more likely to appeal to novices than Ultima\\". Roy Wagner reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\" For simple exploring adventure and mapping this fills the need. It is a good introduction for beginning or younger players. There are no puzzles to solve.\\" Lee Hutchinson writing for Ars Technica recalled of the Trilogy set that \\"It seems like rather a thin experience, but I spent hours wandering through the three Temple adventures as a ludicrously overpowered adventurer.

This type of equipment is mostly used in electronics and electrical engineering. Soldering station consists of one or more soldering tools connected to the main unit, which includes the controls (temperature adjustment), means of indication, and may be equipped with an electric transformer. Soldering stations may include some accessories ‚Äì holders and stands, soldering tip cleaners, etc. Soldering stations are widely used in electronics repair workshops, electronic laboratories, in industry. Sometimes simple soldering stations are used for household applications and for hobbies. == Soldering Station Components == The main soldering station elements which determine its compatibilities are soldering tools. Different tools are used for different applications and soldering stations may be equipped with more than one of them at a time. The main tools for soldering are: * contact soldering irons; * desoldering tweezers or SMD hot tweezers; * desoldering gun; * hot air gun; * infrared heater. Soldering iron is the most common working tool of a soldering station. Some stations may use simultaneously several soldering irons to make the process quicker and more convenient, as there is no need to change the soldering tips or readjust the station or the soldering temperature. Some stations may use some specialized soldering irons, such as ultrasonic soldering irons or induction soldering irons. === Soldering Irons === Soldering iron as a part of soldering station has a number of advantages.  Increased operability  * The operator may set the temperature according to the solder alloy in use * Stability of the preset temperature. * Operation mode indication, including temperature display.  Better heating element quality   Main unit with power supply  * Galvanic isolation of the heating element from the electricity network. This increases your own safety and protects the components you are soldering. * Heating element operates under low voltage (10-30 V). It is good for safety. It prolongs the heating element lifetime as well. * Grounding of the whole unit. * The station has a fuse.  Increased user comfort  * The working part has smaller size and weight. * Station design integrates soldering aid accessories: soldering iron stands, soldering tip cleaners, etc. * Some stations have auto switch-off function. However, most soldering stations can only be used on your desktop. Also, it costs more than just a separate soldering iron. === Desoldering Tools === Desoldering is a very important stage in PCB repair. It is often needed to disassemble some components just to make sure they work or check their condition. That is why it is important to detach the elements without any possible damage to them. The means that may be integrated in soldering stations are: SMD hot tweezers heat up and may not only melt the solder alloy but grab the needed component as well. They may have different types of tips for different applications. Desoldering iron is usually made in a shape of a gun. It is capable of taking in the air (vacuum pickup) and solder alloy. Non-contact heating tools include hot air and infrared heaters. They are used for SMT disassembling. === Hot Air Guns === Accta 301 soldering station with hot air gun and soldering iron They use a hot air stream for heating up the components. Hot air is focused on the certain area using special hot air nozzles. Usually soldering hot air guns are capable of providing temperatures from 100 to 480 ¬∞C. === Infrared Heaters === Soldering stations with infrared (IR) heaters are a separate type of soldering stations and differ a lot. Such stations provide high-precision soldering and the process is more like that in electronics industry. The temperature profile may be set based on the components being soldered. This minimizes the risk of components deformation or damage due to the temperature difference. == Soldering Station Classification  Contact Soldering Stations === This type reminds a soldering iron equipped with an electronic temperature adjustment unit. The main technical parameter of the contact soldering station is the power. The power determines the operation convenience and soldering effectiveness. The modern stations have power from 10 to 200 W and more. The most common are the models with 50-80 W power. The higher is the power the more amount of heat you may transmit for the same time. It allows reducing the temperature on the heating element to the minimal possible value for melting the solder alloy. And vice versa ‚Äì the lower is the power the higher temperature you need to melt the solder. High temperature means a risk of a component overheating. Especially it concerns semiconductor components or electrolytic conductors. According to the solder alloy used these soldering stations may be divided into two subtypes:  Tin/lead soldering stations   Lead-free soldering stations  This type of stations is characterized by heating element with a power up to 160 W. Lead-free solder alloys need higher temperatures to be melted, so the station needs more power. If the station is equipped with a temperature regulator, it may be used for operation with a traditional lead-containing solder. === Digital and analogue soldering stations === The stations may be divided into digital and analogue according to the control unit operation method. Analogue stations have a temperature stabilization that operates as follows: * The heating element is working till the soldering tip reaches certain temperature, then the power switches off. * When the temperature becomes lower than a certain level the heating element is on again and the soldering tip is being heated. The operation is ensured by the magnetoelectric relay. It is controlled by electronics and a temperature sensor. Analogue control system has an advantage ‚Äì it is the cost. The disadvantage is a low operation precision that results in soldering tip overheating. This leads to problems like: electronic components overheating, often tip change. Digital soldering station is operating using a PID regulator that is controlled by a microprocessor. Digital control method is more precise. === Induction soldering stations === Induction soldering stations are characterized by high power and excellent thermal stability. They use the technology of heating and thermal stabilization based on Curie temperature. American manufacturer Metcal is a leader in this market segment, however there are other brands. === Non-contact soldering stations ===  Infrared soldering stations   Hot air soldering stations  Stations with hot air guns are used in cases when just a soldering iron is not enough. Disassembling microchips requires a hot air gun. SMD components soldering with hot air is much more convenient. Hot air guns usually come with special nozzles for hot air stream regulation. Popular manufacturers: Hakko, Quick, Accta, Goot, etc.  Rework systems  For professional laptop, game console and other electronics repair, special repair systems are used. These repair systems usually combine several components: hot air gun, soldering iron, desoldering gun, etc. This equipment allows effective desoldering and soldering large BGAs. These operations require special approach and certain amount of process automation. The most popular manufacturers: Ersa, Martin, Jovy Systems, Quick, Scotle. == External links == * How to Use a Soldering Station * Everything about Soldering Station an Article by TMS Virdi * Types of Smd Rework Station == See also == * Soldering * Soldering iron * Soldering gun * Solder Category:Soldering Category:Power tools ","title":"Soldering station"},{"id":"19298933","text":"Links of Noltland is an archaeological site near Grobust Bay on the north coast of Westray in Orkney, Scotland. The site contains the remains of both a Neolithic village and later Bronze Age dwellings.Orkneyjar ‚Äì The Links of Noltland. Accessed 28 July 2013 Links of Noltland Excavations at the site () in the 1980s found a Neolithic building, which is now in the care of Historic Scotland who are funding further excavation. In 2009 the Westray Wife was discovered, a lozenge-shaped figurine that is believed to be the earliest representation of a human face ever found in Scotland. The face has two dots for eyes, heavy brows and an oblong nose and a pattern of hatches on the body could represent clothing. Archaeologist Richard Strachan described it at the time as a find of \\"astonishing rarity\\". Two further figurines were subsequently found at the site, one in 2010 and the other in 2012, a situation described as \\"unprecedented\\" by Culture Minister Fiona Hyslop. There may have been several phases of occupation, as the first figurine was probably carved 2500 ‚Äì 3000 BCE and one structure has been dated to c. 2000 BCE. Other finds include polished bone beads, tools, and grooved ware pottery. The full extent of the site is believed to exceed the size of Skara Brae on the Orkney mainland. The ruins are being backfilled to protect them from winter storms. Another 2009 discovery is that of a large building for collective use described as a \\"village hall\\". The structure overlooks the main settlement and would have been about wide and had walls thick. Other finds are revealing a remarkably detailed picture of life in the settlement over a long period of time spanning the Neolithic and early Bronze Age. It is clear that the residents farmed crops such as barley, kept livestock such as cattle and sheep and were partial to venison. Nearby are Queen o' Howe broch, The Lum Head chambered tomb and the ruins of Noltland Castle. ==See also== *Timeline of prehistoric Scotland ==Footnotes== Category:3rd-millennium BC architecture in Scotland Category:Archaeological sites in Orkney Category:Stone Age sites in Scotland Category:Bronze Age sites in Scotland Category:Prehistoric Orkney Category:Former populated places in Scotland Category:Historic Scotland properties in Orkney Category:Scheduled monuments in Scotland Category:Neolithic Scotland Category:Westray ","title":"Links of Noltland"},{"id":"19298959","text":"Sarangay is a creature resembling a minotaur with a jewel or gemstone attached to its ears.

He was the fifth son of William Waddington of Walkeringham, Nottinghamshire, by his wife, Grace Valentine, daughter of Henry Sykes of London. He was educated at the East India Company's Addiscombe Military Seminary from 1811 to 1812.Vibart 1894, p. 662. ==Career== Waddington received his commission as a second lieutenant in the Bombay Engineers on 3 April 1813, and arrived in India on 22 May 1814. He accompanied Colonel Kennedy‚Äôs force to the Concan, and his services at the assaults of Madanghar (eighty miles south-east of Bombay) and of Jamba were favourably mentioned.General orders, 15 February 1818 Towards the end of 1819 he went home on leave, was promoted to be lieutenant on 16 November 1820, married in 1822, and on his return to India in 1823 acted as executive engineer at Baroda. He was promoted to captain on 29 July 1825, and appointed in October executive engineer of the Baroda subsidiary force. In November 1827 he was moved to Bombay as civil engineer at the presidency, and in August 1828 acted also as superintending engineer. He was appointed to the command of the engineer corps and to take charge of the Engineer Institution in October 1830. In September 1834 he commanded the engineers at Sirur, returning to the presidency as superintending engineer in January 1835. On 28 June 1838 Waddington was promoted to be major, and in May of the following year was appointed superintending engineer of the southern provinces. In September 1841 he went to Sind as commanding engineer. He accompanied Major-General Richard England in his march through the Bolan Pass in the autumn of 1842, and was mentioned in England's dispatch of 10 October 1842 for his services at Haikalzai. On 4 November 1842 he was appointed command engineer in Baluchistan as well as Sind. He accompanied Sir Charles Napier as commanding engineer of his force in the celebrated march of eighty-two miles from Dijikote on 6 January 1843 to Imamghar, where they arrived on 12 January. Instructed to demolish the fort, Wadding fired his mines on 15 January. He himself lit the fuses of three mines, and was bending over the train of one when his assistant called upon him to run as the other mines were about to explode. Waddington took part in the Battle of Miani on 17 February 1843, where he acted as aide- de-camp to Napier and was mentioned in dispatches. He was also at the Battle of Hyderabad, or Dubba, on 24 March, when Napier again mentioned him as having \\"rendered the most important aid in examining the enemy's position with that cool courage which he possesses in so eminent degree\\". On 4 July he received the medal for Miani and Hyderabad and was appointed a Commander of the military division of the Order of the Bath and also promoted to lieutenant- colonel. After a period of leave in England, Waddington was employed in special duty at Puna until October 1847, where he was appointed superintending and executive engineer at Aden, altered to chief engineer in April 1851, the court of directors desiring that 'their high approbation of his valuable services be conveyed to this zealous and able officer' (30 July 1851). He was promoted to colonel on 24 Nov. 1853 and major-general on 28 November 1854. On 4 May 1854 he was appointed chief engineer in the public works department, Bombay, and his services in making the preparation for the Persian expedition received official acknowledgement on 3 Dec. 1856. In November 1857 Waddington was appointed to the command in Sind. In September 1858 he was compelled by ill-health to leave India, and he died in London on 22 November of that year. ==Personal life== In 1822 Waddington married Anne Rebecca, daughter of John Pinchard of Taunton, Somerset; and by her he left a family of six sons and two daughters. His eldest son, William (b. 1823), colonel Bombay Staff Corps, served in Persia (medal and clasp) 1856-1857, and became J.P. for Wiltshire. Another son, Thomas (b. 1827), became major-general of the Bombay Staff Corps. He married in 1862 Emilie Helena Willoughby, daughter of Major-General Michael Francklin Willoughby. ==Publications== Waddington contributed several papers to the Professional Papers of the Corps of Royal Engineers, including: *\\"Account of the Battle of Meanee\\" (vol. 9) *\\"Doctrines of Carpentry in their Application to the Construction of Roofs\\" (vol. 10) ==ReferencesReferred works=== * * *India Office Records *Despatches *Kelly's Handbook *Royal Engineers' Records ;Attribution Category:1796 births Category:1858 deaths Category:Alumni of Addiscombe Military Seminary Category:Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:British East India Company Army generals Category:English civil engineers Category:People from Bassetlaw District ","title":"Charles Waddington (East India Company officer)"},{"id":"19299021","text":"G63 may refer to : * Mercedes-Benz G-Class flagman 4x4 produced by Mercedes- Benz. * Mercedes-Benz G63 AMG 6x6 limited production AMG version of G-Class with six wheels * HMCS Haida (G63), a 1943 Royal Canadian Navy Tribal-class destroyer * HMS Gurkha (G63), a 1940 British Royal Navy L class destroyer and also : * Polyneuropathy in diseases classified elsewhere ICD-10 code ","title":"G63"},{"id":"19299044","text":"Thrasyvoulos Tsakalotos (; 3 April 1897 - 15 August 1989) was a distinguished Greek army Lieutenant General who served in World War I, the Greco-Turkish War of 1919‚Äì1922, World War II and the Greek Civil War, rising to become Chief of the Hellenic Army General Staff.

He led his brigade during the Gothic Line offensive in Italy, including the Battle of Rimini. After the liberation of Greece from the Axis, he was transferred with the 3rd Greek Mountain Brigade in Athens. A strong anticommunist, he did not obey to orders by the pro-EAM minister Ptolemaios Sarigiannis to leave the center of the city with his men and disagreed with the British General Ronald Scobie on a possible evacuation of the city. With his men he participated in the Dekemvriana clashes against the pro-communist EAM-ELAS in Athens during December 1944. ===Greek Civil War=== On 24 March 1945 he was appointed commander of the 2nd Infantry Division. In the next year he was placed as the head of the Superior War Academy and promoted to Major General. An able officer, he rose quickly: commander of III Army Corps in 1946, he was appointed Assistant Deputy Chief of the Army General Staff in 1947, then promoted to Lieutenant General and given command of I Army Corps and then II Army Corps in 1948. He played a major role in the victory of the Hellenic Army in the Greek Civil War,leading the pacification of western Epirus in July‚ÄìAugust 1948, and helped stabilize the situation at the Battle of Vitsi in October, before initiating the operations for the final suppression of Communist guerrilla activity in the Peloponnese in December. After the Communists captured Karpenisi, Tsakalotos led the task force sent to pursue them; and he defended Arta from capture. Finally, he led the final charge against the communist stronghold at Mount Grammos during the decisive Operation Pyrsos in 1949. His personality led to strained relations with his superior, Alexander Papagos; the British officer Christopher Woodhouse, who had been active in the Greek Resistance and knew both, wrote of the relationship between Papagos and Tsakalotos: \\"The disharmony between Papagos and Tsakalotos was rather like that between Eisenhower and Montgomery in the Second World War. [...] Tsakalotos was a brilliant field commander, egoistic and impetuous, always convinced that the crux of any strategic problem was where he happened to be in command. Papagos was a superlative staff officer, impeccable in logistic planning and exact calculation, a master of the politics and diplomacy of war, with little experience of high command in battle.\\" ===Later career=== From 31 May 1951 until 20 November 1952, he served as Chief of the Army General Staff. Shortly before, Papagos had announced that he was resigning to pursue politics after a clash with King Paul. The king directed Tsakalotos to arrest Papagos, but Tsakalotos refused to carry out the order. ==Diplomatic career== In 1957‚Äì1960, Tsakalotos also served as Greece's ambassador to Yugoslavia. In April 1967, following the fall of Ioannis Paraskevopoulos' government, Tsakalotos was suggested to Andreas Papandreou as the possible head of a national unity government. Papandreou suspected the proposal had come from the King, but he dismissed the idea as Tsakalotos did not have the support of the \\"democratic camp\\" and because he believed a national unity government at that time was unacceptable. Following the Metapolitefsi of 1974, Tsakalotos became a supporter of Andreas Papandreou and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK); in the elections of 1985 he published a statement encouraging people to vote for PASOK and saying that he felt Andreas was like a brother to him. On 23 March 1984, as a symbolic gesture of reconciliation and healing of the divisions caused by the Civil War, Tsakalotos publicly met and shook hands with his erstwhile adversary, Markos Vafiades, the commander of the Communist forces. Thrasyvoulos Tsakalotos died in Athens on 15 August 1989. ==Personal life== Tsakalotos's first cousin's grandson, or first cousin twice-removed, Euclid Tsakalotos, is a Syriza MP and served as Minister of Finance in Alex Tsipras's second cabinet. ==Works== *TŒ± ŒìŒπŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒµŒΩŒ± œâœÇ Œ±Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ¨Œ≤ŒªŒ∑œÑŒøœÇ Œ¥œçŒΩŒ±ŒºŒπœÇ ŒµŒπœÇ œÑœÅŒµŒπœÇ ŒπœÉœÑŒøœÅŒπŒ∫ŒøœçœÇ œÉœÑŒ±Œ∏ŒºŒøœçœÇ œÑoœÖ Œ±Œ≥œéŒΩŒøœÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œøœç 'EŒ∏ŒΩŒøœÖœÇ, œÑœÖœÄ.

He was a professor of civil law at the University of St Andrews until 1611, when he resigned his chair and moved to England. ==Works== Welwod is primarily known for his writings opposing Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius' concept of Mare Liberum (the freedom of the seas), the idea that the seas and oceans were free for all to use and not the property of anyone. Welwod used Biblical texts to argue that in some cases nations could claim exclusive national rights over territorial waters. Welwod wrote a Scots language treatise on the law of the sea, The sea-law of Scotland, published in 1590 by Robert Waldegrave ‚Äî 'the earliest book of maritime jurisprudence'.. Welwod stated in the preface that the book was aimed at Scottish mariners and merchants. It was written in a vernacular style, and presented the sea law in the form of simple rules. Welwod later reworked The sea-law of Scotland into An Abridgement of All Sea- Lawes (1613), which included a chapter arguing against Hugo Grotius' Mare Liberum. He later expanded this chapter, \\"Of the Community and Propriety of the Seas\\", into a full work entitled De dominio maris (1615). Welwod's main concern was that Grotius' theories could be used to justify the large-scale herring fishing in Scottish waters by Dutch fleets which, according to Welwod, had caused a collapse in the fishing industry along the Scottish east coast. Hugo Grotius responded to Welwod's critique by writing Defensio capitis quinti Maris Liberi oppugnati a Gulielmo Welwodo (\\"Defense of the fifth chapter of Mare Liberum, opposed by William Welwod\\"). The work was written around 1615 but not published until 1872. In this work, Grotius complained that Welwod had misunderstood his treatise as an attempt to justify Dutch fishing in Scottish waters, when it was in fact primarily intended to argue for the Dutch right to trade with the East Indies. ==NotesReferences== * * T.

His three brothers also served in the Navy; Reginald Friend Hannam Henderson became an Admiral, Frank Hannam Henderson a Vice- Admiral, and John Hannam Henderson, retired as a Commander. (John's son Sir Reginald G. H. Henderson also became an Admiral.) ==Naval career== Henderson entered the Navy in 1859, aged 14, as a cadet aboard . From 1860 to 1864 he served aboard the 90-gun second rate ship of the line , flagship of Rear Admiral Sir Alexander Milne, and also the steam sloop Styx, on the North America and West Indies Station, receiving promotion to sub-lieutenant in 1864. He then served aboard in the Channel Squadron. He was promoted to lieutenant on 11 September 1866, and served aboard the troopship at Portsmouth from 1867, until taking part in the voyage around the world of the Flying Squadron in 1869‚Äì1870, serving aboard , flagship of Rear Admiral Sir Geoffrey Hornby. From 1872 to 1875 Henderson served aboard the screw sloop on the Pacific Station, then the sloop Eclipse on the North America and West Indies Station in 1877, and was on 'particular service' aboard the breastwork monitor in 1878. He was promoted to commander on 1 January 1880, with seniority from 31 December 1879, and served aboard the armoured cruiser , flagship of Commodore Sir James Erskine, on the Australia Station from 1881 to 1885. On 1 January 1886 he was promoted to captain, and was sent to study at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, where he was appalled to discover that apart from a few lectures on international law and naval history, studies were confined purely to technical matters, resulting in a total lack of knowledge of, and preparation for, war. He wrote a strongly worded letter, which he took personally to the Admiralty, and was permitted to read it to the Sea Lords in which he urged that naval officers should be instructed in naval history, strategy and tactics. Only Lord Charles Beresford was in any way interested in Henderson's ideas, which in the end came to nothing. In May 1888 Henderson received a letter from Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan, commenting on Henderson's remarks on a paper by Rear-Admiral Colomb on the naval defences of the United Kingdom. The two men became regular correspondents thereafter, but did not meet in person for several years. Undeterred by lack of official support, Henderson became a firm believer in value of a free debate, despite having taken part in a discussion on a paper by Sir Edward Reed at the United Service Institute, in which he criticised the s. A few days later Henderson received a message from the First Sea Lord stating that his remarks had harmed his prospects of obtaining a command. Again, when commanding Edgar in the Mediterranean, he attempted to initiate a discussion on the strategy of possible operations in the event of war, which was attended by the Commander- in-Chief, who brought the debate to an abrupt halt by saying, Well, gentlemen, you may be sure that when war comes the Commander-in-Chief will know how to act and to make all necessary arrangements. Good morning. Henderson returned to sea in 1889, commanding the screw corvette until 1892, and seeing action serving in the Naval Brigade under Admiral Sir Edmund Fremantle, Commander-in- Chief of the East Indies Station, in the punitive expedition against the Sultan of Vitu in East Africa in October 1890. For this service he was mentioned in dispatches and received the East and West Africa Medal with \\"Vitu\\" clasp. He subsequently commanded the second class cruisers and , then the first class protected cruiser , on the Mediterranean and later China Stations from 1894 to 1896. He returned to England to serve as the Captain of the Fleet Reserve at Devonport in 1896‚Äì1897, flying his flag in and successively. From 1898 he served as commodore and naval officer-in-command at Jamaica, receiving promotion to rear admiral on 20 November 1899. He remained in Jamaica after the end of his appointment, being appointed a Member of the Privy Council and the Legislative Council on 28 March 1900. Henderson then returned to England to serve as Admiral Superintendent of Devonport Dockyard from 1902 until 1906, receiving promotion to vice admiral on 28 November 1904. On 22 August 1906 Henderson was appointed a member of a Royal Commission, led by Gerald William Balfour, alongside Frank Forbes Adam and Ivor John Caradoc Herbert, and with Charles Clive Bigham as Secretary, to inquire into management of navigational aids of the coast of the United Kingdom by the three General Lighthouse Authorities, and into the workings of these Authorities, and to report what changes, if any, were desirable. On 30 June 1908 Henderson was promoted to admiral, but was placed on the Retired List at his own request, two days later, on 2 July. ==Post-naval career== In retirement Henderson served as a member of the Metropolitan Asylums Board from 1909 to 1921. Known as an ardent advocate of the reform of naval education, in 1912 he was approached by a group of young officers who asked him to act as treasurer and secretary of a correspondence society, which the following year began to publish the journal The Naval Review, of which Henderson served as editor until 1931. On 24 March 1914 he was appointed to the board of the Royal Patriotic Fund Corporation. On 3 June 1924, in the King's Birthday Honours, Henderson was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (Military Division). Admiral Henderson died in April 1931, aged 85. ==Personal life== Henderson was married to Sarah MacCabe, of New South Wales, and they had one daughter. ==References== Category:1845 births Category:1931 deaths Category:People from Dover District Category:Royal Navy admirals Category:Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire ","title":"William Hannam Henderson"},{"id":"19299248","text":"airchair. The stab is a breakdance technique necessary to perform many downrock and power moves. It is not a distinct move, but is incorporated into many breakdance moves including the turtle, cricket, jackhammer, crab-walk, hand glide, some versions of the windmill, and many other floats and freezes. It allows the breakdancer's entire weight to be supported by bony structures while expending minimal muscular energy to maintain balance. The stab is accomplished by placing the olecranon process of the elbow firmly against the bones or tensed muscles of the abdomen, side, or back. Perhaps the most basic stab places the elbow against the anterior superior iliac spine. Meanwhile, the hand is placed against the ground. The radius and ulna are held perpendicular to the ground with the weight of the body on either side of the point of contact kept in perfect balance.

Plants in this genus are shrubs or bushes with simple leaves and tube-shaped flowers with the petals forming two \\"lips\\" - the upper one with two lobes and the lower one with three. ==Description== Plants in the genus Hemigenia are shrubs or bushes with simple leaves which are arranged either in opposite pairs or in whorls. The flowers are arranged singly or in groups in upper leaf axils, often appearing to form a spike of flowers. There are five sepals which are joined at their base to form a tube. The five petals form a tube with two \\"lips\\" - an upper lip with two lobes and a lower one with three. There are four stamens. Plants in this genus can be distinguished from those in the similar and closely related Hemiandra by their less strongly odoriferous leaves and from Prostanthera, Microcorys and Westringia by technical differences in their stamens. ==Taxonomy== The genus Hemigenia was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae. Brown nominated Hemigenia purpurea the type species. The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek words hemi and genias meaning \\"a beard\\" referring to a part of the anthers. ==Distribution== Hemigenia species are mostly endemic to Western Australia, but H. cuneifolia occurs in New South Wales and Queensland, H. biddulphiana grows in Queensland and H. purpurea in New South Wales. ===Species=== *Hemigenia appressa G.R.Guerin *Hemigenia argentea Bartl. *Hemigenia barbata Bartl. *Hemigenia benthamii G.R.Guerin *Hemigenia biddulphiana F.Muell. *Hemigenia botryphylla G.R.Guerin *Hemigenia brachyphylla F.Muell. *Hemigenia bracteosa G.R.Guerin *Hemigenia buccinata G.R.Guerin *Hemigenia canescens (Bartl.)

He wrote over 200 songs in a variety of styles ranging from canci√≥n and bolero to guajira and bambuco. Although he was a popular performer, founding several successful groups, he made very few recordings. He lived for almost a century, having a great influence on the music of his country. == Career == Rosendo Ruiz Su√°rez was born in Santiago de Cuba on 1 March 1885. He became a tailor, but soon became interested in music. Like Sindo Garay, Ruiz had a humble background and he taught himself the guitar. Pepe S√°nchez gave him lessons to improve his guitar technique and took him into a group of musicians who were brightening up fiestas for wealthy whites in the environs of Santiago de Cuba.Ca√±izares, Dulcila (1995). La trova tradicional. 2nd ed, La Habana. p. 40 Short of money, he moved first to Cienfuegos, then to Havana. His first composition was \\"Venganza de amor\\", written in 1902. He later composed \\"Mares y arenas\\", with lyrics by Francisco V√©lez Alvarado. The song became a success in 1911 when it was premiered by Jos√© \\"Galleguito\\" Parapar at Havana's Teatro Mart√≠ in his first professional performance. The first recording of a composition by Ruiz was Maria Teresa Vera's and Rafael Zequeira's 1914 rendition of \\"Tere y Gela\\". The duo would go on to record many of Ruiz's songs, sometimes accompanied by Manuel Corona on guitar: \\"Rosina y Virginia\\" (also known as \\"Dos lindas rosas\\"), \\"Confesi√≥n\\", \\"Naturaleza\\", \\"Encanto de Estela\\", \\"Patria y honor\\", \\"Violeta\\", \\"Mi Cuba bella\\", \\"Llanto del coraz√≥n\\" and \\"Cuba aliada\\". In 1917 he composed his socialist anthem, \\"Redenci√≥n\\", which premiered on 1 May 1919 (International Workers' Day) at the Teatro Payret in Havana. In 1918, Jos√© Castillo and Manuel Luna recorded one of his most famous songs, \\"Falso juramento\\". In 1926 he founded the Cuarteto Cuba with Vitaliano Matas (lead guitar), Eusebio Corzo (vocals) and Rafael Ruiz (lead vocals). In 1929 he founded the Tr√≠o Habana with Emilio Betancourt and Enrique Hern√°ndez, making several recordings for Brunswick Records the same year. In 1929 he was bestowed an honorary award at Seville's Ibero-American Exposition. In 1932, the Cuarteto Mach√≠n recorded in New York City his famous guajira \\"Junto a un ca√±averal\\", and Julio Cueva's orchestra recorded his preg√≥n \\"Se va el dulcerito\\" in Paris. In 1936 he formed the Tr√≠o Azul in Havana with Guillermo Rodr√≠guez Fiffe and Enrique Valls, who came as a duo from Santiago. They had a hit with \\"Bilongo\\" (also known as \\"La negra Tomasa\\"), a composition by Rodr√≠guez Fiffe. In 1937 they recorded a single for Victor: \\"La comparsa Malaco\\" / \\"Solavaya\\". He wrote a guitar manual which ran into several editions, and was a president of the Forum de la Trova (1967).

After trying unsuccessfully to sell their babies to some traveling gypsies, Mary shows up and tells them that her little sister just won a prize at the baby show. The boys decide to enter their babies in the show, only to discover that all the prizes are gone except the one for the fattest baby. Mickey comes up with the idea to enter Joe as a baby. After Joe escapes, the gang decides to make their own baby show. When the parents discover their babies are missing they assume that the gypsies stole them. When the gang finds out that their parents are after them, they hide in the gypsy wagon, which drives off. As the police and parents chase the wagon down the street, the babies start falling off the wagon and the parents stop and pick them up as they continue running. The adults finally catch up with the wagon, the gypsy is arrested, and the kids reunited with their parents. ==Production notes== Cradle Robbers marked the final appearance of Ernie Morrison as \\"Sunshine Sammy.\\" It also marked the first appearance of Peggy Ahern.

He played ten internationals for Wales, and was selected for the British Lions playing in all six tests of the 1950 tour of Australia and New Zealand. Evans was a hard tackling flanker, but his skill was seen in his intelligent defensive positioning. He would often sit behind the three midfield players in offence to ensure that if passing movements broke down the opposition could not counterattack. He specialised in subduing fly-half play and would often disrupt opposing midfield trios into poor positions causing errors in play without even engaging them. ==Rugby career== Evans won a Welsh Secondary Schools cap while at Rhymney Secondary School, and after leaving school joined the Monmouthsire Police. In 1943 he joined the Royal Air Force and played rugby for several unit teams. After he was demobbed, he rejoined the police force and was elected captain of his local rugby club at Rhymney.

The carvings depict at the base the sleeping Roman soldiers guarding the tomb of Christ, at the top are the apostles gazing heavenward at his ascending feet. In between is the risen Christ, the graveclothes draped over his shoulder.

After the Surrender of Japan, the teacher is forced to return home as Taiwan was placed under the administrative control of the Republic of China. On his trip home, he pens seven love letters to express his regret for leaving Kojima Tomoko, who originally planned to elope with him to Japan. More than 60 years later, Aga (Fan), a struggling young rock band singer leaves Taipei to return to his hometown of Hengchun. There, his step father (Ma), the Town Council Representative, arranges a position for him as a postman, replacing the aging Old Mao (C. Lin), on leave after a motorcycle accident broke his leg. One day, Aga comes across an undeliverable piece of mail that was supposed to be returned to the sender in Japan; the daughter of the now deceased Japanese teacher had decided to mail the unsent love letters to Taiwan after discovering them. Aga unlawfully keeps and opens the package to discover its contents, but the old Japanese-style address \\"Cape No. 7, K≈çshun District, Takao Prefecture\\" can no longer be found. Meanwhile, a local resort hotel in nearby Kenting National Park is organizing a beach concert featuring Japanese pop singer Kousuke Atari, but Aga's step father makes use of his official position to insist that the opening band be composed of locals. Tomoko (Tanaka), an over-the-hill Mandarin-speaking Japanese fashion model dispatched to Hengchun, is assigned the difficult task of managing this hastily assembled band, led by Aga along with six other locals of rather particular backgrounds. After a frustrating trial period, Aga and Tomoko unexpectedly begin a relationship. With some assistance from hotel maid Mingchu (S. Lin), who is revealed to be Kojima Tomoko's granddaughter, Tomoko helps Aga find the rightful recipient of the seven love letters. Tomoko then tells Aga that she plans on returning to Japan after the concert because of a job offer. After returning the seven love letters, a heartbroken but determined Aga returns to the beach resort and performs a highly successful concert with his local band alongside Kousuke Atari while Kojima Tomoko reads the letters. ==Cast== {  style=\\"text-align: left\\" - !width=\\"120\\"Actor !width=\\"240\\"Role !width=\\"500\\"Note(s) -  Van Fan  Aga  The band's lead singer.

Wei believed that such a setting would provide the ideal backdrop for the \\"harmony in diversity\\" theme of Cape No. 7. The film was shot between September and November 2007 in Hengchun and its neighboring Checheng and Manjhou Townships, located on the Hengchun Peninsula of Pingtung County. The set for the 'Hotel Chateau' (where the concert is held and at which model Tomoko stays) was the real life Ch√¢teau Beach ResortCh√¢teau Resort hotel's Website at Kenting.

Cast members Pei-Chen Lee and Chang Hsin-yan revealed that during filming Wei could barely afford the film rolls and lodging for the crew.ÂºµÊ≤ÅÂ¶çÊµ∑Ëßí‰∏ÉËôüËÉåÂæå ‰∏çÁÇ∫‰∫∫Áü•ÁöÑËæõÈÖ∏ Wei later said this film's zealous reception should help him manage his debts.„ÄäÊµ∑Ëßí‰∏ÉËôü„ÄãÁ•®ÊàøÈÄ≤ÈÄº6ÂçÉËê¨ 3ÂçÉËê¨ÂÇµÂãôËß£Â•ó Wei believed \\"that the films that hit the screens before the end of summer vacation in 2007 were all 'safe bets'\\", because they avoided competition from Hollywood blockbusters. Wei followed this theory when he released Cape No. 7 in 2008. Besides, Wei focused on the promotion of the film. The film was premiered in July, 2008, and attracted the interest of Buena Vista International, which made 50 copies of the film and distributed them nationally in August. The film's 133 minute theatrical version was edited from the first cut of 160 minutes. Aga and Tomoko's love scene was shortened, and some of their dialog before the love scene was cut as well.„ÄäÊµ∑Ëßí‰∏ÉËôü„ÄãÂèØ‰ª•Ë™™ÁöÑ‚ÄßÁßòÂØÜ The final version was shortened in Mainland China after the government film agency snipped out over half an hour of the film for political purposes. Nevertheless, rampant piracy in Mainland China saw the unedited version mass distributed via street stalls and the internet. The film's marketing is combined with extensive merchandise, including original soundtrack CD, books, novelization, accessories, tours and musical concerts. The film contributed tourism for Hengchun, and especially boosted 'Hotel Chateau'. A televised concert was held with actors performing some numbers in the film. ==Music== A soundtrack album was released on 24 October 2008 by Forward Music. # \\"The First Letter: \\"Tomoko, Are You Still Waiting for Me?\\" (Yukihiko Kageyama) # \\"Don't Wanna\\" (Van Fan) # \\"The Second Letter: Destiny Is this Era's Sin\\" (Yukihiko Kageyama) # \\"Love You to Death\\" (Joanne Yang, etc.) # \\"The Third Letter: Tomoko, I Fell in Love with You at that Moment\\" (Yukihiko Kageyama) # \\"Where to Go\\" (Bjanav Zenror) # \\"The Fourth Letter: Why the Sea Breeze Always Brings Weep\\" (Yukihiko Kageyama) # \\"To Daughter\\" (Patricia Ho) # \\"The Fifth Letter: Tomoko, I Really Miss You: Ah!

It centers on the complex relationship between two sisters, Pearl and May, as they go through great pain and suffering in leaving war-torn Shanghai, and try to adjust to the difficult roles of wives in arranged marriages and of Chinese immigrants to the U.S. This work marks a return to many of the themes the author addressed in her first major work, On Gold Mountain, a memoir of her family's history. The novel is set between 1937‚Äì57 and matches Parts IV and V of the memoir. The novel received an Honorable Mention from the Asian/Pacific American Awards for Literature. The sequel, Dreams of Joy, was released May 31, 2011. ==Plot summary== Shanghai Girls is divided into three parts: Fate, Fortune, and Destiny. Here See treats Chinese immigration from a personal view through Pearl's narration. In On Gold Mountain she objectively placed 100 years of her Chinese family history in the context of the daunting challenges Chinese immigrants faced in coming to America in search of Gold Mountain. America's mistreatment of Chinese immigrants is stressed in both memoir and novel. The sisters' story is interrelated with critical historical events, famous people, and important places‚Äîthe Second Sino-Japanese War, the Battle of Shanghai, internment at Angel Island, Los Angeles Chinatown, Hollywood, World War II, the Chinese Exclusion Act, McCarthyism, etc. Historically significant people appearing in the novel include Madame Chiang Kai-shek, actress Anna May Wong, film personality Tom Gubbins, and Christine Sterling, the \\"Mother of Olvera Street.\\"William D. Estrada, \\"Los Angeles' Old Plaza and Olvera Street: Imagined and Contested Space\\", Western Folklore, Vol. 58, No. 2 (Winter 1999), 112ff., 121-122 Snow Flower and the Secret Fan explores the complex relationship between two intimate friends. In Shanghai Girls See treats the loving yet conflicted relationship between two best friends who also happen to be sisters, especially in the context of their relationship to Pearl's daughter Joy. In speaking of Shanghai Girls, See has commented: \\"Your sister is the one person who should stick by you and love you no matter what, but she‚Äôs also the one person who knows exactly where to drive the knife to hurt you the most.\\" That being said, in Shanghai Girls it is the love of Pearl and May for each other that survives. ===Characters=== *Pearl Chin The protagonist in the story. Her Zodiac sign is the Dragon. The elder of two sisters, she always thought that she was less loved by their parents because of her looks. She is in love with Z.G. Li, a painter/photographer who takes pictures of and paints Pearl and May. Although belonging to a wealthy family, she earns a small amount modelling with her sister, however, this is easily squandered off in her nightlife. She later marries Sam Louie to help pay off her father's debt to the Louies. She and Sam raise Joy, May's child as their own daughter. Later on she becomes pregnant with Sam's baby. She carries the baby to term, but the child is a stillborn boy. *May Chin Younger sister of Pearl. Her Zodiac sign is the Sheep. Flirtatious and haughty, she is jealous of her sister who went to college and who she thought was favored by their parents. She has a secret romantic relationship with Z.G. Li. Later it is discovered that she became pregnant by him, resulting in a daughter, Joy. May gives Joy to Pearl to raise as her own daughter because on the night of her wedding to Vern, Sam's brother, she could not bring herself to sleep with him. Father Louie (Vern and Sam's father) might suspect she is pregnant by someone else, so both she and Pearl pretend that Pearl was the one pregnant all along. ==NotesReferences== *Dong, Stella.

He also won European titles in 1974, 1976 and 1978. ==Biography and awards== Tediashvili was born to a Georgian father, invalid of World War II, and a Russian mother, who moved to Georgia with her other son Herman after her husband was killed in World War II. Herman also became wrestler and then worked as wrestling coach in Chi»ôinƒÉu. Tediashvili was selected among the Soviet Union top ten athletes of the year in 1973 by the Federation of Sports Journalists of the USSR. In 1976, he was awarded the Order of Lenin. In 1987, he and Georgian Olympic cyclist Omar Pkhakadze played two heroes in the historical Georgian film Khareba da Gogia. The film director Georgiy Shengelaya chose them instead of professional actors for their athletism, charisma and energy required for these roles; their assistants in the film were also played by sportsmen, world champions in wrestling. Tediashvili fought in the Abkhazian War, along with his son, who was killed in the conflict. From 1995 to 2003, he was a parliamentary deputy from a district of Kakheti. ==References * Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:People from Kakheti Category:Soviet male sport wrestlers Category:Olympic wrestlers of the Soviet Union Category:Wrestlers at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:Wrestlers at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Male sport wrestlers from Georgia (country) Category:Olympic gold medalists for the Soviet Union Category:Olympic medalists in wrestling Category:World Wrestling Championships medalists Category:Medalists at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:Communist Party of the Soviet Union members Category:Recipients of the Presidential Order of Excellence Category:Military personnel from Georgia (country) Category:Members of the Parliament of Georgia Georgia Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin Category:Honoured Masters of Sport of the USSR ","title":"Levan Tediashvili"},{"id":"19300377","text":"Polat Kocaoƒülu (born 3 May 1979) is a Turkish professional basketball player, currently plays for Gamateks Pamukkale √úniversitesi. ==External links== *Profile at tblstat.net *Profile at tbl.org.tr Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Dar√º≈ü≈üafaka SK players Category:Galatasaray S.K.

It has two or three grass-like leaves and up to ten yellow flowers with reddish-brown marks and blotches. ==Description== Diuris pardina is a tuberous, perennial herb with two or three linear leaves long, wide and folded lengthwise. Between two and ten flowers wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The flowers are yellow and heavily blotched with dark reddish-brown. The dorsal sepal is erect, long and wide. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, wide, turned downwards and usually strongly crossed. The petals are erect to curved backwards, with an egg-shaped blade long and wide on a reddish-brown stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is wedge-shaped, long and wide and the side lobes are oval, long and about wide. There are two raised, fleshy calli long in the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from August to October. ==Taxonomy and naming== Diuris pardina was first formally described in 1840 by John Lindley and the description was published in his book, The Genera and Species of Orchidaceous Plants. The specific epithet (pardina) is derived from the Ancient Greek word pardos meaning \\"leopard\\". ==Distribution and habitat== The leopard orchid is found in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. It grows in well-drained soils in heath and forest and there is considerable variation in the colouration of the flowers. In New South Wales in occurs south from Mudgee and in Victoria it is widespread and common in the southern half of the state.

The species is endemic to the eastern Indian Ocean, ranging from Dampier, Western Australia to Gulf St Vincent in South Australia, with an apparent division in the populations of the two states. Yellowfin whiting inhabit relatively shallow waters for their entire life, often found on tidal flats and creeks, as well as large estuaries. It is one of the largest members of the smelt-whiting family, growing to 42 cm, and can be distinguished by a number of anatomical and colour related features. Yellowfin whiting are benthic carnivores, preying predominantly on polychaete worms, with minor amounts of copepods, amphipods and bivalves also commonly taken. The species shows a change in diet with age, and also dietary differences with other sillaginids presumably to minimize competition. Reproduction occurs at different times throughout its range, generally focused around summer, with up to 217,000 eggs produced per season. Yellowfin whiting reach sexual maturity at around 20 cm, with each individual spawning more than once. The species forms the basis of major fisheries in both Shark Bay, Western Australia and the two Gulfs of South Australia, with around 260 tonnes of fish taken each year. They are also a popular target for shore based anglers, with a reputation as a very good table fish. ==Taxonomy and naming== The yellowfin whiting is one of 29 species in the genus Sillago, which is one of three divisions of the smelt whiting family Sillaginidae. The smelt- whitings are Perciformes in the suborder Percoidei. The species was first recognised and scientifically described by the German naturalist Wilhelm Peters in 1864 based on the holotype collected from the waters near Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia. Peters assigned the species name schomburgkii in honor of the German explorer and botanist Moritz Richard Schomburgk, who became the second Director of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens. Schomburgk collected the specimen and sent it to Peters, who was by then the curator of the Berlin Zoological Museum (in the present day the Berlin's Natural History Museum), an institution for which Schomburgk had collected extensively before in the past during expeditions to British Guiana. Prior to Peter's description, the yellowfin whiting was at first confused with the similar Sillago bassensis, which also occurs within the same range. The species was also independently renamed twice after the initial naming, first by Francis de Castelnau in 1873 as Sillago bostockii, and then Gilbert Percy Whitley in 1944 who named the species Sillago frazeri (or S. fraseri). These two names are considered to be junior synonyms under the ICZN naming rules, and are considered invalid. The species is known primarily as the 'yellowfin whiting' or 'yellow-finned whiting' in reference to the yellow pectoral, anal and caudal fins, and is recognised as such by the Australian Government. In Western Australia, the species is usually referred to as the 'western sand whiting' due to its close similarity with the sand whiting (Sillago ciliata) of Eastern Australia, with the name 'fine-scaled whiting' rarely used. ==Description== The yellowfin whiting has a similar body profile to most other Australian sillaginids, with colour and swimbladder morphology the simplest identifying features. It is one of the largest members of the Sillaginidae, growing to a known maximum known length of 42 cm and a weight of 860 g. The body is elongate and compressed, with the dorsal profile more arched than the ventral. The mouth is small and oblique, having a broad band of villiform teeth in each jaw. There are two slightly separated dorsal fins, the first consisting of 10 to 12 spines and the second of 1 spine followed by 19 to 22 soft rays. The anal fin consists of 2 spines followed by 17 to 20 soft rays, the ventral of 1 spine and 5 soft rays and the pectoral of 15 to 16 rays. The caudal fin is emarginate, and is made up of 17 rays. The body is covered in small ctenoid scales extending to the upper head and nostrils of the fish, also present behind each ray of the dorsal and anal fins. The lateral line has 66 to 76 scales, and the cheek has 4 or 5 rows of scales, all of which are ctenoid. There is a total of 37 vertebrae in the species. The swimbladder has an incised anterior margin with no median or anterolateral projections and there is a single tapering posterior extension which rapidly narrows to a slender tube. A duct like process is present on the ventral surface of the swimbladder. The yellowfin whiting is a sandy brown to pale silvery grey colour, with a darker dorsal surface and paler underside. There is a narrow silver mid-lateral band with a brownish band above, although these bands may be pale or indistinct. The dorsal fins are both hyaline with rows of small brown spots and the anal fins are pale yellow with a cream margin. The ventral fins are also yellowish, and the pectoral fin is pale yellow to hyaline with a fine dusting and lacks a dark spot at the base. As yellowfin whiting grow, the yellow colour of the fins often fades and in large specimens may be completely absent. The caudal fin is greyish. ==Distribution and habitat== The yellowfin whiting is endemic to the waters of the eastern Indian Ocean off south west Australia, and is believed to exist as two separate populations, one in Western Australia and the other in South Australia. The western population extends from Dampier, south to Albany, with no records of the species between Albany and Spencer Gulf further west. The southern population occurs in Spencer Gulf and Gulf St Vincent, extending eastward to the Fleurieu Peninsula. Tagging studies have found that the populations in each of South Australia's Gulfs are isolated from each others, but no genetics studies have been undertaken to clarify this. Yellowfin whiting primarily inhabit shallow protected inshore waters in depths of less than 10 m, often moving across tidal flats less than a meter deep. They are commonly found on sand flats, bars and spits, as well as mangrove lined tidal creeks, mud flats, seagrass beds and estuaries. Yellowfin whiting move with the tide, pushing into the shallows of creeks and flats to forage at high tide and moving back to the sandy hollows of deeper slopes of channels and banks as the tide falls. In Western Australia, they often enter large, sandy estuaries such as the Swan and Leschenault Estuary where they many penetrate the limits of brackish water, indicating they can survive in low salinity environments. Conversely, they have been recorded in the extremely saline waters of upper Spencer Gulf and Shark Bay, suggesting a wide tolerance to salinity. Juveniles inhabit the same environments as adults in South Australia, but in Western Australia adults move from the tidal creeks and seagrass beds to more sand dominated environments including high energy beaches. ==Biology== The yellowfin whiting is a schools species, with its movements highly controlled by tidal phases, with the species often moving over shallow sand banks with the rising tide. Where it occurs with other species of sillaginids, it is unique in that it remains in the shallow protected inshore waters, while other species move offshore as they grow. This is likely a response to reduce interspecific competition between sillaginids. The dietary and reproductive biology of the yellowfin whiting has been extensively studied in Western and South Australia, where it comprises a major part of the fishery. As with a number of other sillaginids, the species has been recorded 'burrowing' in the substrate to avoid predators. ===Diet and feeding=== The yellowfin whiting is a benthic predator, using its well developed eyesight and a downward pointing jaws that can be protruded to 'suck up' and capture its prey from the seafloor. Studies on the mouth morphology of a range of sillaginids concluded that the mouth morphology of most species has little influence on the type of prey caught, with differences in diet more likely due to variations in the foraging behavior. Studies conducted in southwest Western Australia found the species predominantly takes polychaetes as its main prey item, although crustaceans, particularly amphipods and penaeids also make up a large portion of its diet. Items taken infrequently or in lesser amounts include small teleost fish, bivalve molluscs, marine plant material and other crustaceans such as tanaids, decapods and cumaceans. Modeling with the stable isotopes 13C and 15N indicate that seagrass and epiphytic algae were the primary initial sources of energy and nutrition that flow into the fish via detritivores which the species preys on, with salt marsh plants and macroalgae contributing in some settings. The species is known to undergo a dietary shift as it grows to adulthood. Young individuals less than 10 cm in length consume considerable volumes of copepods and minor amounts of polychaetes, but once they reach around 10 cm, the diet shifts to a polychaete-dominated one. Further growth sees an increase in the volume of amphipods, small fish and oligochaetes taken. These changes appear to be unrelated to mouth morphology, instead the fish becomes more mobile and possesses a larger mouth to be able to take these prey. The yellowfin whitings' diet also varies spatially and temporally, which appears to be a function of prey availability at different sites and periods of the year. There is little resource partitioning between the small individuals of sillaginids which inhabit shallow inshore habitats, with Sillago vittata, S. burrus and Sillaginodes punctatus also taking copepods as their primary prey in southwest Western Australia. This changes as each species grows, with S. vittata and S burrus moving to deeper waters to avoid interspecific competition, whilst the remaining S. schomburgkii and Sillaginodes punctatus partition the resources, with S. punctatus consuming more decapods and shrimps. ===Reproduction and growth=== Yellowfin whiting reach sexual maturity at a length of 200 mm in males and 230 mm in females, with the majority of both sexes reaching this length by the end of their second year of life. The timing of spawning varies over the species range, a trait found in a number of other sillaginids. In the northernmost part of its range in Shark Bay, spawning occurs between August and December, while further south off southern Western Australia, spawning occurs between December and February. The South Australian population also spawns between December and February, with this event preceded by the movement of fish into shallow tidal and estuarine regions where spawning occurs. Ripe fish then break off the main schooling body to form smaller spawning schools, where the eggs are shed. There is conflicting data concerning the pattern of spawning in yellowfin whiting, with an earlier Shark Bay study finding the species to be a single spawner, whilst recent studies in the south indicate they are multiple spawners. In South Australia, once spawning has occurred the fish disperse and move further offshore once again. Females release between 170,000 and 217,000 eggs per season, with these eggs being pelagic and spherical, with a diameter of 0.6 mm. The development and morphology of the newly hatched larvae has been extensively described in the ichthyological literature. By the time they reach 2.7 mm, the mouth and gut are functional, the eyes are pigmented, a gas bladder is present, and yolk absorption is complete. The larvae are elongate, having 36 to 38 myomeres, with flexion occurring by 4.8 mm. The juveniles appear in Western Australian estuaries during March, with subsequent growth being fairly rapid. However, the yellowfin whiting is one of the slower growing sillaginids, but reaches a much larger maximum size than most of its relatives, with a known maximum length of 42 cm. On average, individuals measure 8 cm after their first year and weigh between 60 and 190 g, while by the end of their second year they have attained 24 cm, with females thought to grow slightly faster than males. The oldest known individual taken was a 12-year-old female that measured 35 cm, while the oldest known male was at least 7 years old and measured 34.8 mm. ==Relationship to humans== The yellowfin whiting is a highly rated table fish, but often considered slightly inferior to the King George whiting, which often occurs in similar areas. Due to its popularity and abundance in both South and Western Australia, it has become a major target for commercial and recreational fishermen, although major declines in population numbers have limited the resources. Roland McKay has also suggested the species has aquaculture potential, especially with its high tolerance to varying salinity levels. ===Commercial fishery=== There are two major fisheries in operation for yellowfin whiting; one in the Gulfs of South Australia and another in Shark Bay, Western Australia. There are also up to four minor fisheries in Western Australia, centered in the Blackwood River estuary, Geographe Bay, the Leschenault Estuary and Cockburn Sound. Fishing methods employed commonly include beach seines, bottom set gill nets along creek edges, ring nets, and long gill nets set on sand banks. Nets are usually set in the mornings in South Australia, when fish often move from the tidal flats back into the deeper channels. The two major fishery areas have produced very large numbers of fish in the past, with the South Australian catch representing up to 65% of the entire catch from the gulfs in the late 1970s. In Shark Bay, the largest known annual catch was 204 tonnes during 1961. This has dropped substantially, and current Shark Bay catches have fluctuated between 100 and 130 tonnes per year since 1990, with the 2003 catch around 110 tonnes. Including the minor fisheries catches of Western Australia, the total WA yellowfin whiting catch was 131.4 tonnes, and made up over 95% of the total whiting catch in the state. South Australia has similar modern catch numbers, with the fishery recovering from a major downturn in the late 1980s, when the catch dropped below 20 tonnes per year for an unknown reason. Concerns were raised about previous over-exploitation, but catch numbers have since recovered to levels of around 150‚Äì170 tonnes per year. ===Recreational fishery=== Yellowfin whiting have become a major target for anglers in both South and Western Australia for a number of reasons: they are very good table fish, they provide good sport on light line, and are easily accessible from beaches and jetties, with a boat not necessary for their capture. Yellowfin whiting are actually most commonly targeted from beaches, estuaries and jetties constructed over shallow waters, with good catches often made on the ingoing and outgoing period of the tide. Due to their easily spooked nature, tackle used to capture the fish is usually very light, with lines kept below 6 kg, hooks below size 4, and sinkers to an absolute minimum as heavy lines and sinkers often scare away the fish. Specialist whiting fishermen often attach a red bead or piece of tubing directly above the hook to attract the fish, although the usefulness of this is debated. The most common bait used is 'beach worms', which may be from a variety of families, with prawns, cockles and squid occasionally taking good catches also. Lure and fly fishing for the species is poorly developed, with their shy nature preventing these methods from being effectively used. The recreational catch often is greater than the commercial catch in some areas, with a survey carried out in Blackwood River indicating 120 700 fish were taken in a year by anglers. A similar survey conducted in the South Australian Gulfs found recreational fishermen accounted for 28% of the entire yellowfin whiting taken during the 2000/2001 period, representing over 50 tonnes of fish. Recreational bag limits have been put in place to prevent over-exploitation by anglers in both states, with South Australia imposing a minimum size limit of 24 cm and a bag limit of 20 fish on anglers. In Western Australia, there is no minimum size limit, but a bag limit of 40 fish in combination with school whitings (Sillago bassensis and Sillago vittata). ==References *Fishbase page for yellowfin whiting *Encyclopedia of life page *Western Angler page (Yellowfin and school whiting) *Fishing WA: Fishing methods for whiting Category:Sillaginidae Category:Fish of Australia Category:Fish described in 1864 ","title":"Yellowfin whiting"},{"id":"19300497","text":"Teoman √ñrge (born March 27, 1990) is a Turkish professional basketball player of Geli≈üim Koleji. ==External links== *Profile at tblstat.net *Profile at tbl.org.tr Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:Alpella basketball players Category:Galatasaray S.K.

It has up to two or three folded leaves and a flowering stem with up to eight yellow flowers with brown to blackish markings. It is similar to D. pardina which has darker flowers with larger brown markings. ==Description== Diuris maculata is a tuberous, perennial herb with two or three linear leaves long, wide and folded lengthwise. Between two and eight flowers wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The flowers are yellow with dark brown to blackish spots on all flower parts, sometimes on the reverse side. The dorsal sepal is erect or curved forwards, long and wide. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, about wide, turned downwards and crossed. The petals are erect to curved backwards, with an egg-shaped blade long and wide on a blackish stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is wedge-shaped, long and wide and the side lobes are long and wide. There are two ridged calli about long in the mid-line of the labellum. The species is similar to D. pardina but has lighter coloured flowers with smaller brown markings. Flowering occurs from July to November. ==Taxonomy and naming== Diuris maculata was first formally described in 1805 by James Edward Smith and the description was published in Volume 1 of his book, Exotic Botany. The specific epithet (maculata) is a Latin word meaning \\"spot\\", \\"stain\\" or \\"speckle\\". ==Distribution and habitat== The spotted doubletail grows in shrubby forest and heath between Taree and Eden, mainly in coastal and near-coastal areas. ==Ecology== This orchid has been shown to mimic the flowers of several native peas, including Hardenbergia violacea and Daviesia ulicifolia. The native bee Trichocolletes venustus visits both orchid and peas flowers and obtains food from the pea but not from the orchid, which even has a UV nectar guide similar to that on the peas. ==References== maculata Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Plants described in 1805 ","title":"Diuris maculata"},{"id":"19300579","text":"Ramnagar is a village of Feni District in the Chittagong Division of Bangladesh.

The Siege of Saigon, a two-year siege of the city by the Vietnamese after its capture on 17 February 1859 by a Franco-Spanish flotilla under the command of the French admiral Charles Rigault de Genouilly, was one of the major events of the Conquest of Cochinchina (1858‚Äì62). Saigon was of great strategic importance, both as the key food-producing area of Vietnam and as the gateway to Cochinchina.Goldstein, 95 ==Background== In 1858, Admiral Charles Rigault de Genouilly attacked Vietnam under the orders of Napoleon III following the failed mission of diplomat Charles de Montigny. His stated mission was to stop the persecution of Catholic missionaries in the country and assure the unimpeded propagation of the faith.Tucker, 29 For his descent on Vietnam, Rigault de Genouilly had a force of 14 warships, 1,000 French marine infantry, and 1,000 troops from the Spanish garrisons of the Philippines (550 Spanish infantry and 450 Filipino light infantry).Gundry, 6 ; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 29 The allied force landed at the port of Tourane in September 1858 and occupied the city after a brief bombardment. However, the allies were soon placed under siege by the Vietnamese and, unable to advance inland beyond the protection of the squadron's guns, were effectively immobilised at Tourane.Tucker, 29Chapuis, 48 ==Capture of Saigon, 17 February 1859== Admiral Charles Rigault de Genouilly (1807‚Äì73) French capture of Saigon in 1859. Realising that the French garrison at Tourane could achieve nothing useful, Rigault de Genouilly decided to strike elsewhere against the Vietnamese. He considered and rejected the possibility of an expedition to Tonkin, and in January 1859 proposed to the navy ministry an expedition against Saigon in Cochinchina, a city of considerable strategic significance as a source of food for the Vietnamese army. The expedition was approved, and on 2 February, leaving capitaine de vaisseau Thoyon at Tourane with a small French garrison and two gunboats, Rigault de Genouilly sailed south for Saigon. His naval force consisted of the corvettes Phl√©g√©ton and Primauguet, the gunboats Alarme, Avalanche and Dragonne, the Spanish despatch vessel El Cano and the transports Sa√¥ne, Durance and Meurthe.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 33 Rigault de Genouilly halted for five days in Cam Ranh Bay for four supply ships to join him with food for the expedition. On 9 February he again got underway. On 10 February the allied flotilla bombarded the forts that defended the interior harbour of Cape Saint-Jacques and soon reduced their cannon to silence. The landing companies, a mixed force of French and Spanish soldiers under the command of capitaine de vaisseau Reynaud, then went ashore and stormed the forts.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 33‚Äì4 On 11 February the five-day voyage upriver began. The transports and the baggage were left at Cap Saint-Jacques. The gunboat Dragonne scouted ahead, followed by the two other gunboats, the two corvettes and the Spanish despatch vessel. Three companies of marine infantry and two Spanish companies, 2,000 men in all, were distributed among the vessels which towed the launches of the naval force. The allied flotilla advanced cautiously as the currents were unknown, and anchored each night in the river. During their passage the French and Spanish vessels halted to reduced six riverside forts, and squads of engineers under the command of capitaine de g√©nie Gallimard were put ashore to burn the wooden stockades that linked the forts. The Vietnamese defended themselves vigorously: Dragonne was hit with three cannonballs, and Avalanche by seven. The invaders took care to ensure that the river could not be closed behind them. After each fort was taken its cannon were either spiked or taken aboard the ships.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 34 The Citadel of Saigon, built by the French in 1790 On the evening of 15 February the naval division (which had been joined in the river by the despatch vessel Pr√©gent) arrived in view of the two forts built by Gia Long's French engineers, which defended Saigon from the south. During the night two armed launches were sent forward to destroy a barrage made of boats lashed together and filled with explosives. At dawn on 16 February Phl√©g√©ton, Primauguet, Alarme and Avalanche anchored 800 metres from the forts. The channel was so narrow that Admiral Charner, on Phl√©g√©ton's bridge, was able to shout his orders to the captains of the other vessels. Pr√©gent, Dragonne and Elcano were a little further back.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 34‚Äì5 The allied flotilla opened fire on the Vietnamese forts and soon found the range. Marine infantry snipers, firing from the mastheads of the French and Spanish ships, picked off the Vietnamese gunners. The Vietnamese responded vigorously, but their aim was uncertain, and the French and Spanish soon beat down their fire. The landing companies were sent ashore to assault the forts, and by 8 a.m. both forts were in Spanish hands.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 35 Later the same day capitaine de fr√©gate Bernard Jaur√©guiberry, the future French admiral and navy minister, scouted the Citadel of Saigon aboard Avalanche. On the morning of 17 February the French and Spanish went ashore and assaulted the citadel. Sergeant des Palli√®res of the marine infantry was the first to enter the citadel, and once the allies were inside the Vietnamese garrison retreated. A force of around 1,000 Vietnamese soldiers attempted to counterattack. Admiral Charner, who was personally directing the action, threw back their attack with Colonel Lanzarote's Filipino troops. At 10 a.m. the French and Spanish flags flew above the citadel.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 35‚Äì6 == Allied occupation of Saigon, February 1859‚ÄìFebruary 1860 == The citadel of Saigon was enormous, and the allies did not have enough men to hold it securely. Rigault de Genouilly therefore decided to blow it up. Thirty-two mines were prepared, and on 8 March 1859 the citadel was wrecked. The rice magazines were also set alight, and burned for several months.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 36 In April 1859 Rigault de Genouilly returned to Tourane with the bulk of his forces, leaving only a small garrison under the command of capitaine de fr√©gate Bernard Jaur√©guiberry to hold Saigon. Jaur√©guiberry's force consisted of a company of French marine infantry, a company of Filipino light infantry under Spanish command, and 400 sailors to work the French artillery. Rigault also left the corvette Primauguet, the gunboats Avalanche and Dragonne and the transport Durance at Saigon. The French repaired the Southern Fort, captured from the Vietnamese in February, and converted it into a stronghold for the garrison.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 37; Histoire militaire, 26 On 21 April 1859 Jaur√©guiberry launched a surprise attack on a Vietnamese fortification that had been built to the west of the town. The allied attack succeeded and the Vietnamese position was burnt down, but allied casualties were 14 dead and 31 wounded out of a total of 800 men engaged. This was such a heavy loss, given the limited allied numbers, that Jaur√©guiberry made no further attacks. The Franco-Spanish garrison of Saigon withdrew to the Southern Fort and bided its time.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 39; Histoire militaire, 28 == Siege of Saigon, March 1860 to February 1861 == The capture of Saigon proved to be as hollow a victory for the French and Spanish as their earlier capture of Da Nang. Jaur√©guiberry's force at Saigon was too small to venture out of its defences, while Captain Thoyon's small French garrison in Da Nang had been placed under siege by the Vietnamese. Meanwhile, the French government was distracted from its Far Eastern ambitions by the outbreak of the Austro-Sardinian War, which tied down large numbers of French troops in Italy. In November 1859 Rigault de Genouilly, whose actions in Cochinchina had come under severe criticism in France, was replaced by Admiral Fran√ßois Page, who was instructed to obtain a treaty protecting the Catholic faith in Vietnam but not to seek any territorial gains.Tucker, 29 The Vietnamese, aware of France's distraction in Italy, refused these moderate terms and spun out the negotiations in the hope that the allies would cut their losses and abandon the campaign altogether. Meanwhile, the French were unable to reinforce the garrisons of Da Nang and Saigon. Although the Austro- Sardinian War soon ended, by early 1860 the French were again at war with China, and Page had to divert most of his forces to support Admiral L√©onard Charner's China expedition. In April 1860 Page left Cochinchina to join Charner at Canton, and the defence of Saigon and the neighbouring Chinese town of Cholon, an important commercial centre, was entrusted to capitaine de vaisseau Jules d'Ari√®s. To garrison these two towns d'Ari√®s had a mere 600 marine infantrymen and 200 Spanish troops under the command of Colonel Palanca y Guttierez, supported by the corvettes Primauguet, Norzagaray and Laplace. To augment this modest force the French armed a number of junks to patrol the rivers, and also recruited Annamese and Chinese auxiliaries to take part in the patrols and man the advanced posts.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 41 In March 1860 the Franco-Spanish force in Saigon, only 1,000 men strong, was placed under siege by a Vietnamese army of about 10,000 men, and had to support an eleven-month siege by greatly superior numbers.Thomazi, La conqu√™te de l'Indochine, 37‚Äì43 At the same time, French strength was also being drained by the Siege of ƒê√† N·∫µng (September 1858 to March 1860), and in March 1860 the French evacuated Da Nang. == End of the siege == Finally, in the wake of the Anglo-French victory at the Battle of Palikao on 21 September 1860, which ended the war in China, reinforcements of 70 ships under Admiral Charner and 3,500 soldiers under General de Vassoigne were dispatched to Saigon. Charner's squadron, the most powerful French naval force seen in Vietnamese waters before the creation of the French Far East Squadron on the eve of the Sino-French War (August 1884‚ÄìApril 1885), included the steam frigates Imp√©ratrice Eug√©nie and Renomm√©e (Charner and Page's respective flagships), the corvettes Primauguet, Laplace and Duchayla, eleven screw-driven despatch vessels, five first-class gunboats, seventeen transports and a hospital ship. The squadron was accompanied by half a dozen armed lorchas purchased in Macao.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 45 After the arrival of these massive reinforcements, the French were able to defeat the besieging Vietnamese at the Battle of K·ª≥ H√≤a on 25 February 1861 and raise the siege.Goldstein, 95 ==See also== *Colonization of Cochinchina *France-Vietnam relations ==NotesReferences== * \\"Charles Rigault de Genouilly\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online * Chapuis, O., The Last Emperors of Vietnam: From Tu Duc to Bao Dai (Westport, Connecticut, 2000) * Goldstein, E., Wars and Peace Treaties, 1816‚Äì1991 (Routledge, 1992) * Gundry, R.

The H8 was similar to the S-100 bus computers of the era, and like those machines was often used with the CP/M operating system on floppy disk. The main difference between the H8 and S-100 machines was the bus; the H8 used a 50-pin bus design that was smaller, more robust and better engineered electrically. The machine also included a bootstrap ROM that made it easier to start up, including code for running basic input/output and allowing input through a front-mounted octal keypad and front panel display instead of the binary switches and lights used on machines like the Altair 8800. The H8 required a separate terminal to be truly useful; Heathkit introduced several terminals as well. A successor model, the \\"All-in-One\\" Heathkit H89, combined a Z-80 processor board and a floppy disk drive into the cabinet of an Heathkit H19 terminal. This model also was sold in fully assembled form as the WH89. These were later sold by Zenith Electronics with their name on the front as the Zenith Z-89. Heathkit H8 (right) and H9 video terminal (left) ==HistoryBackground=== MITS announced the Altair 8800 in January 1975 and started selling kits soon after. Marketed to electronics hobbyists through trade magazines like Popular Electronics, the company founders felt there would be limited appeal and expected to sell only a few hundred systems. Instead, they received orders for thousands in the first month. Sales were so much greater than expected that MITS was unable to clear the order backlog for the better part of the year. \\"There was a subsequent article in February's Popular Electronics and the MITS people knew the Altair was here to stay. During that month alone, over 1,000 mainframes were sold. Datamation, March 1975.\\" \\"By the end of May, MITS had shipped over 2,500 Altair 8800's\\" The Altair sparked off such intense interest in the microcomputer world that a number of other companies jumped in to fill the sales backlog, building machines that were clones of the Altair. The primary component of this design was the S-100 bus, so named because it used a 100-pin edge connector that MITS found at bargain prices when they were designing the machine. Unfortunately, the pins were connected from the backplane with no real thought put into their layout, and it had a number of problems that made it unreliable. In spite of any design flaws, standardization led to a flourishing of companies selling into the S-100 market. The introduction of floppy disk controllers and the disk-based CP/M operating system dramatically improved the system's capabilities and started the process of turning them into practical small-business tools. By the late 1970s they were starting to displace minicomputers and other systems in a number of roles. ===H8=== Heathkit was a long-established player in the electronics market, making kits for products that had proven themselves in the market. Some of these were quite complex, including a color television.Joseph Arendt, \\"The Color Television That Dad Built\\" , 18 May 2008 In 1977 they decided to enter the microcomputer market, and designed the H8. The machine was announced in July 1977 and started selling that fall at a price of $379.Heathkit H8, Obsolete Technology Homepage, image of ad in Scientific American \\"Heathkit Computers\\". To be useful, the user also need to purchase a 4 kB SRAM card ($139) and some form of storage controller; at a minimum this would be the H10 paper tape punch/reader or the H8-5 Serial I/O card ($110) which controlled a cassette tape, using a 1200-baud variant of the Kansas City standard format. Another common accessory was the H9 video terminal, which was also driven by the H8-5 card; although any serial terminal would work. Unfortunately, the H9 was inexpensive but ugly in appearance, was limited to upper case characters and 12 display lines, and used a cheap array of switches for its keyboard. It was eventually superseded by the H19 terminal, a nicer design ergonomically and capable of lower-case and graphic-like characters. The H19 became a major product line of its own. The H17 floppy disk system became available in 1978, normally sold with one drive but expandable with a second (and later to three). Use of the H17 required at least 16 kB of RAM. The H8 could use CP/M, and often did, but early machines required either a special version of CP/M that was \\"org'd\\" at 8K instead of zero, or a small hardware modification and an updated ROM to do so. Heath also had its own DOS, unsurprisingly named HDOS, which was written by J. Gordon Letwin. Letwin later went to Microsoft to become the chief architect of OS/2. At the time the H8 was introduced, the computer market was in the midst of a shift from the hobby market that had spawned it to a \\"user\\" market that purchased pre-assembled machines. Heath followed this trend and introduced the WH8 in fully assembled form for $475. Like the H8, the WH8 would need to include several other cards to be useful. The disk drive system was also available fully assembled as the WH17. For the CP/M operating system, Heathkit provided the WH67, a 10 MB eight-inch hard drive and the H47 eight-inch floppy disk system. ===H89=== In 1978 Heath introduced the Heathkit H88 which combined the H19 terminal and a new Zilog Z80-based single-board processor into the case of the H19. A version with a disk drive incorporated to the right of the terminal screen became the H89. The machines bore a strong resemblance to the TRS-80 Model III and similar all-in-one computers. The H89 was available both in kit form for $1595, and fully assembled form as the WH89 for $2295. Soon after the introduction of the H89, Heathkit was purchased by Zenith to enter the microcomputer market.Sol Libes, \\"BYTE News...\\" in BYTE, Volume 4 Number 11, November 1979, pg. 81 They continued sales of the H89 with their own labeling on the front as the Zenith Z89. Eventually, Zenith Data Systems (Heathkit plus the computer division of Zenith) was purchased by Bull HN (CII Bull, Honeywell and Nippon Electric) because they needed a US maker of microcomputers to comply with government purchase requirements. Kit sales were ended soon after that purchase.Lawrence Fisher, \\"Plug Is Pulled on Heathkits, Ending a Do-It- Yourself Era\\", The New York Times, 30 March 1992 ==Description== Heath chose not to implement the S-100 bus and instead created their own, known as \\"Benton Harbor Bus\\" after their home town. The bus was based on a 50-pin connector and laid out to avoid the electrical problems of the S-100 system (like +5V and ground being placed beside each other). The H8 was packaged in a box-like chassis with pressboard sides and metal sheeting for the rest of the case. The top sheet was heavily perforated to form cooling vents. The machine was built up from the backplane mounted on the right-hand side panel of the case, with ten 50-pin card slots. \\"Dinosaur Sightings: Computers from the 1970s: Heathkit H8\\" , zdnet photo gallery The first and last slots were spaced differently from the rest, and the power supplies occupied some of the space needed for the last card. This meant that the last card not only had to accommodate the narrow spacing but also could not be full-length, leaving eight \\"standard\\" slots available for full-length cards. The front panel plugged into the first slot and the CPU plugged into the second, leaving seven for further expansion. The card slots were arranged on an angle, which allowed the case to be reduced in height. Each card contained its own voltage regulators, using the Z-shaped mounting bracket as a heat-sink. (Power distribution on the backplane was unregulated +8V and +/-18V; the cards regulated these to their requirements, typically +5V and +/-12V.) Another notable change was the replacement of the front-panel toggle switches and lights of a standard early-model S-100 system with a keypad and seven-segment LED display (early S-100 machines like the Altair or IMSAI 8080 contained no ROM and when they were started the user had to \\"key in\\" a program via the toggle switches to read a paper tape. Once this \\"loader\\" program was ready, a paper tape containing a more complete loader would be read in, allowing the user to load programs from cassette or floppy disk). On the H8 all of this code was already pre-installed in a 1 kB ROM in a monitor program known as \\"PAM8\\", occupying locations 0 through 3FF16 and the H17 disk I/O drivers used for booting, occupying a 2 kB ROM occupying locations 180016 through 1FFF16Dave Wallace, \\"The basic H-8: A Backplane, a CPU Card and a Front Panel\\" , 16 June 2001 The ROM contained code to control the keypad and display,\\"H-8 Technical details\\" , 29 September 2001 booting it directly into an operable state. Several versions of the PAM-8 ROM were sold as upgrades; at one point Heathkit switched to using 2 kB ROMs, occupying through 7FF16 and subsequently to a 4 kB ROM occupying through FFF16. The ROMs interfered with the operation of standard CP/M, which assumed it could write the memory near location 0, in particular the interrupt handler pointers. PAM8 and portions of HDOS used an unusual address notation called \\"split octal\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200727003857/https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13140527 where 16-bit numbers were split into two 8-bit numbers printed in octal: the first location was \\"000.000\\" and the location after \\"000.377\\" was \\"001.000\\". In order to distinguish numbers in split-octal notation from 16-bit octal numbers, the two digit groups were often separated by a special symbol. Most mini- and micro-computers used either straight octal (377 was followed by 400) or hexadecimal.) With the introduction of the optional HA8-6 Z-80 processor replacement for the 8080 board, the front-panel keyboard got a new set of labels and hexadecimal notation was used instead of octal.Dave Wallace, , 29 September 2001 == Benton Harbor Bus == The 50-pin \\"Benton Harbor Bus\\" was considered an improvement on the S-100 bus. \\"Heathkit H8\\". \\"Heathkit H8\\". The 50-pin bus of the H8 contains sixteen address lines, eight data lines, 5 interrupt lines, and the system control lines. The bus does *not* supply +5V -- each card is expected to have its own local +5V regulator powered from \\"unregulated\\" +8V on the bus. \\"Heathkit Manual\\". 1977\\\\. p. 32; p. 38; p. 57. ==See also== * Heathkit H11 * Zenith Z89 ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * ==External links== * \\"Heathkit Manual for the Digital Computer Model H8\\", Heath Company, 1977 * \\"In your Free Heathkit Catalog\\", early Heathkit computer advertisement * \\"Introduction of the Personal Computer\\", Heathkit brochure for the H8 and H11 Category:Early microcomputers ","title":"Heathkit H8"},{"id":"19300661","text":"The Heathkit H11 Computer was an early kit-format personal computer introduced in 1978.

A Txoko () is a typically Basque type of closed gastronomical society where people come together to cook, experiment with new ways of cooking, eat and socialize. The most traditional ones are only open to male members. They are very popular institutions; the town of Gernika, Spain, for example, has approximately 15,000 inhabitants and nine txokos with some 700 members in total.Plaza, Joseba Txoko in Wandler, R. (ed) Euskadi Walter Frey 1999 ==Name== Txoko, a diminutive form of zoko,Trask, Larry The History of Basque Routledge 1997 literally means nook, cosy corner in Basque. In some regions, the variant xoko is used. In Spanish, they are called sociedades gastron√≥micas, in French soci√©t√©s gastronomiques. ==History== The first record of a txoko goes back to 1870 in San Sebasti√°n, Spain, from where they spread outwards geographically in all directions. They are a modern development of originally informal groups of friends who would regularly meet to eat, drink, sing, and talk. During the Franco years, txokos became increasingly popular as they were one of the few places where Basques could legally meet without state control, speak Basque and sing Basque songs as the constitution of the txokos prohibited the discussion of politics on the premises. ==Setting up a txoko== Sociedad Celed√≥n, a txoko in Vitoria-Gasteiz Normally, a txoko is set up by a group of friends who decide to set up a society. Once enough founding members have been found, they rent a local restaurant or in some cases, buy an appropriate location and equipment. Normally these are premises in a basement with a kitchen or, in more affluent societies, at ground level. They are funded communally from the outset. Members pay a monthly membership fee which varies from society to society and the exact setup. A treasurer, administrator and buyer are usually nominated who oversee the administration of the txoko. Usually, someone outside the society is hired to deal with the cleaning. Each txoko has a society constitution that sets out things like the maximum number of members, administration issues and so on. Curiously, most traditional txokos have a clause in their constitution that prohibits the discussion of politics on the premises. Some very conservative txokos have clauses that do not permit women access to the txoko at all such as the Sociedad Gaztelubide in San Sebasti√°n which goes back to 1933. However, most txokos today allow women access to enter the txoko to eat, drink and socialize, but not to cook. Because the number of members is fixed, there are usually long waiting lists, and vacancies in existing txokos become available only sporadically. ==Running a txoko== Since a txoko typically can have up to 80 members but space for less than that, usually not all members use the txoko at the same time. Someone will normally arrange for a smaller group of friends to get together to cook dinner for themselves, their families or guests. Such a group then \\"books\\" the txoko, buys, collects, harvests, hunts, or fishes for fresh ingredients and gets together to prepare the meal. Each member has free access to the txoko's communal stocks. Every individual is responsible to record items such as food and drink that have been used from the communal stocks for themselves or their personal guests and pay for them. This system is fully self-regulated. A few times a year, all txoko members are invited to get together which occasionally leads to space problems, but it is rare for all members of a txoko to meet at the same time. The ratio between txoko members and guests can vary greatly. At the very least, one txoko member must be present at a dinner but since members are free to invite as many guests as they wish, they may on occasion be the only member present if they are holding a dinner for their football club, extended family, a business dinner, etc. ==Impact on Basque cuisine== The development of txokos has had a significant impact on Basque cuisine. Many traditional dishes have been rescued or resurrected by txokos which would have otherwise died out. They have also influenced the development of new dishes as txoko members frequently experiment with new dishes, ingredients and methods, or variations of existing dishes. They are also places where information on the best and cheapest ingredients available is exchanged. This in turn has led to Basque cuisine being both highly refined and affordable. ==Txokos outside the Basque Country== In the recent years, txokos have started to appear outside the Basque County or even Spain, including one in the Slovenian town of Medvode.https://www.facebook.com/Txoko-Club-Slovenija-657431397635776/ ==References *Sociedad Gaztelubide *Sociedades Gastronomicas Category:Basque cuisine Category:Gastronomical societies ","title":"Txoko"},{"id":"19300856","text":"The Sun Down Limited is a 1924 American short silent comedy film directed by Robert F.

Light gray is oil, dark gray is seawater. The Coulombi Egg Tanker is a design that is aimed at reducing oil spills. It was approved by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) as an alternative to the double hull concept. The United States Coast Guard does not allow this design to enter US waters, effectively preventing it from being built.. == Concept == The design is an enhanced Mid-Deck Tanker and consists of a series of centre and wing tanks that are divided by horizontal bulkheads. The upper wing tanks form ballast tanks and act as emergency receiver tanks for cargo should the lower tanks be fractured. The lower tanks are connected to these ballast tanks by non-return valves. When a lower tank is damaged, the incoming sea water pushes the oil in the damaged tank up into the ballast tank. Because of the hydrostatic pressure, there is an automatic transfer out of the damaged tank. == Advantages == The double-hull design is aimed at the probability of zero outflow. In low energy collisions where only the outside hull is penetrated, this will be the case. However, in high energy collisions both hulls are penetrated. As the tanks of a double hull tanker are larger than those of MARPOL tankers and pre-MARPOL tankers and the height of the cargo above the water line is higher, the resulting spill can be much larger than these single hull designs. In the Coulombi Egg design spillage is greatly reduced, possibly to zero. Where a double hull VLCC has a ballast tank coated area of about 225,000 m¬≥, in a Coulombi Egg tanker this area is reduced to 66,000 m¬≥. This reduces maintenance and corrosion risks, which otherwise may result in structural failure, as was the case with the Erika and Prestige. == References Bibliography== * ==External links== * \\\\+ \\\\+ Category:Ship types Category:Ship design Category:Shipbuilding ","title":"Coulombi Egg Tanker"},{"id":"19301040","text":"Amsterdam Amstel (; abbreviation: Asa) is a railway station in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The station opened in 1939. It is located to the southeast of Amsterdam Centraal in the borough of Amsterdam-Oost, near the Amstel river. Amsterdam Amstel is used daily by 50,000 train and metro passengers. Rail services at the station are provided by NS, the principal railway operator in the Netherlands. Metro, tram and city bus services are provided by municipal operator GVB. Regional buses are operated by Connexxion. Amstel station is situated in the Omval business district which includes the Rembrandt Tower, the tallest skyscraper in the city, and the Leeuwenburg campus of the Hogeschool van Amsterdam. ==History== Queen Wilhelmina (1939). Mural by Peter Alma (1939).Sculpture Terugblik (Retrospect, 1939) by Theo van Reijn.The station was built under the direction of architects H.G.J. Schelling of NS, the principal railway operator in the Netherlands, and John Leupen of the City of Amsterdam. The railway station was opened on 15 October 1939, by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. It is part of the Spoorwegwerken Oost (Eastern Railway Works), in which the railway lines between the Amsterdam Centraal and Amstel were placed on embankments and streets were bridged with viaducts. By eliminating the many level crossings in this part of the city, the project made an end to the many delays on these lines. Amstel replaced the Weesperpoortstation (1843), the terminus station on the Amsterdam‚ÄìArnhem railway which was situated near the present-day Weesperplein metro station. By replacing this terminus station, trains between Utrecht Centraal and Amsterdam Centraal no longer needed to reverse when leaving the station, leading to additional time savings on this route. As Amstel station is situated southeast of the former Weesperpoortstation, it has become a major transport hub for the eastern and southern boroughs of Amsterdam. In 1977, when the Amsterdam Metro was opened, Amstel station also became a metro station. The station hall has been decorated with several murals (1939) created by Dutch artist Peter Alma (1868-1969). The murals reflect the importance of technological advancement, in particular of the railroads. Images of the murals are also used on the window film decorating the outer windows of the platform roof. The station hall also features a 1958 ceramic tile panel, also designed by Peter Alma and manufactured by H. Rijneveld. Until 2003, it was placed in the former Marnixbad swimming pool. Both outside and inside the building are two sculptures (1939) by Theo van Reijn, which are called 'Terugblik and Toekomst der Spoorwegen' (Translated: 'Retrospect and Future of the Railways\\") together. In 1977, at the opening of the metro station, an artwork by Rudi van de Wint entitled Ruimtediagonaal ('Space Diagonal') was placed in the station hall. The work featured a tube hanging diagonally from the ceiling. This artwork has since been removed.W.R.F. VAN LEEUWEN & H. ROMERS Een spoor van verbeelding. 150 jaar monumentale kunst en decoratie aan Nederlandse stationsgebouwen. Zutphen, De Walburg Pers, 1988 In 2006, the engineering building at the southern end of track 4 was decorated with a number of panels designed by Serge Verheugen. In 2001, the station underwent major renovation works, which included an expansion of the number of shops and food outlets in the station hall. ==Station layout== The station has two island platforms and four tracks. Tracks 1 and 4 are used for rail services. The two middle tracks, numbers 2 and 3, are in use by the Amsterdam metro since 1977, allowing for cross-platform transfers between train and metro. Originally, Amstel station was a terminus station for car-sleeper trains. Therefore, the western island platform had a ramp allowing cars to access the platform. With the arrival of the metro in the 1970s, the car-sleeper service moved to 's-Hertogenbosch. The platforms at Amstel station are closed off by ticket barriers, only accessible with an OV-chipkaart smart card, with separate access points for NS train and GVB metro services. The NS ticket barriers, however, remain opened permanently until the OV-chipkaart system is fully implemented in the rail network. The tunnel underneath the station has been designated a joint NS and GVB OV- chipkaart area. Passengers transferring between trains and metros can use each operator's card readers on the platforms to check in and check out. == Services  Trains === , the following train services call at this station: *Express **Intercity: (Schagen‚Äì)Alkmaar‚ÄìAmsterdam‚ÄìUtrecht‚ÄìEindhoven‚ÄìMaastricht **Intercity: Den Helder‚ÄìAmsterdam‚ÄìUtrecht‚ÄìArnhem‚ÄìNijmegen **Intercity: Enkhuizen‚ÄìAmsterdam‚ÄìUtrecht‚ÄìEindhoven‚ÄìHeerlen **Intercity: Enkhuizen‚ÄìAmsterdam‚ÄìUtrecht‚ÄìEindhoven‚ÄìMaastricht *Local **Sprinter: Uitgeest‚ÄìAmsterdam‚ÄìBreukelen‚ÄìWoerden‚ÄìRotterdam **Sprinter: Amsterdam‚ÄìUtrecht‚ÄìRhenen === Metros === Amsterdam Metro routes 51, 53 and 54 call at Amsterdam Amstel (called Amstelstation on the metro system). *51 Central Station - Amstel - Overamstel - RAI - Zuid - Buitenveldert - Amstelveen *53 Central Station - Amstel - Van der Madeweg - Diemen-Zuid - Bijlmer East - Gaasperplas *54 Central Station - Amstel - Van der Madeweg - Duivendrecht - Bijlmer ArenA - Holendrecht - Gein === Trams === GVB operates one tram service from Amstel: *12 Amsterdam Amstel - De Pijp - Museumplein - Leidseplein - Dam - Central Station === Buses ===  City buses  These services are operated by GVB. *37 Station Amstel - Muiderpoort - Flevopark - Zuiderzeeweg - Nieuwendam - Buiksloot - Station Noord *40 Station Amstel - Watergraafsmeer - Science Park - Muiderpoort *46 Station Amstel - Watergraafsmeer - Diemen - Diemen-Zuid - Duivendrecht - Bijlmer ArenA *62 Station Amstel - RAI - Buitenveldert - VU - Stadionplein - Haarlemmermeer - Hoofddorpplein - Sloten - Station Lelylaan *65 Station Zuid - Rivierenbuurt - Station Amstel - Watergraafsmeer - KNSM Island  Regional buses  These services are operated by Connexxion and Keolis, as part of the R-Net network. *320 Amsterdam Amstel - Muiden P&R; \\\\- Gooimeer P&R; Blaricum Hospital - Huizen - Blaricum P&R; \\\\- Hilversum *322 Amsterdam Amstel - Muiden P&R; \\\\- Almere Poort - Gooisekant - Almere Parkwijk *327 Amsterdam Amstel - Muiden P&R; \\\\- Almere 't Oor Bus Station - Almere Haven  International buses  Until December 2014, the Amsterdam Eurolines coach terminal was located at Amstel station.

He completed a Senior Cambridge certificate as a cub reporter at the daily newspaper, Utusan Melayu, where he began his career in journalism in 1940. Samad's family is \\"very conscious\\" of their Javanese heritage, and Samad himself spoke English with thick Javanese accent. == Career == During the Japanese occupation of Malaya during World War II, Samad worked for the Japanese-supported newspaper, Berita Malai. He became editor of Berita Malai when he was just 21 years old. The British, who controlled Malaysia during the colonial era, returned following the Japanese defeat and briefly imprisoned Samad. He was released after a short time and returned to work at the Utusan Melayu. Samad wrote extensively in support of Malaysian independence from the United Kingdom. He often met with the Malay supporters of independence, as well as the separatists who were against Dutch rule in nearby Indonesia. For his actions, Samad was arrested by the British authorities again in 1951. He was released from prison in 1953 and again returned to work at Utusan Melayu. Samad founded the People's Action Party (PAP) with Lee Kuan Yew, the future Prime Minister of Singapore. However, disagreements between Samad and both Lee and the Utusan Melayu resulted in his move to the city of Kuala Lumpur. While in Kuala Lumpur, Samad became the head of the Berita Harian newspaper and the managing editor of the New Straits Times Press (NSTP) group. Samad promoted several social causes within his writing in post-independence Malaysia. He drew attention to social inequalities within Malaysian society, called for the national standardisation of the Malay language and reported on the sometimes complex relationship between race and Malaysian politics. For his writings on social issues, which were popular with the public, Samad was arrested in 1976 under the Internal Security Act. He was finally released from prison five years later in 1981. Samad rejoined the New Straits Times Press group following his release from prison as an editorial adviser. He retired from full-time journalism in 1988. == Awards == He was honoured for his contribution in 1992 by the King of Malaysia, who at the time was Sultan Azlan Shah of Perak. Samad also separately received the Pejuang Sastera (Literature Champion) for literature and journalism. He was also awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Journalism, Literature and Creative Communications Arts in 1994 for his efforts in support of Malaysian independence, democratic nation building and Malay cultural revival in Malaysia. == Death == Samad died quietly on the evening 4 September 2008, at Pantai Medical Centre in Kuala Lumpur. He succumbed from a severe lung infection and kidney failure at the age of 84. Prior to this, he had been hospitalised in the intensive care unit since 24 August 2008, due to breathing difficulties. Lee Kuan Yew sent his condolences to Samad's son, describing him as able and shrewd though with an innate ability to accept changed realities. In the condolence letter, Lee said that they were friends even though they had parted company politically. When Samad wanted to visit his family in Singapore, Lee had recommended that the entry ban on Samad be lifted.http://www.channelnewsasia.com/palmnews/singaporelocalnews/view/374318/1/.html Samad was survived by his children (whom he had with his first wife, Hamidah Hassan), as well as his grandchildren & great grandchildren. He had ten children during his life, eight of whom are still living. He had two sons, Hamed and Kamal, and daughters Maria, Norlin, Nuraina, Norazah, Nurazlin and Nurazrina. Maria and Nuraina (http://nursamad.blogspot.com) are former journalists and are active bloggers. Samad's first wife, Hamidah Hassan, had died in 1990. He was buried at the Muslim cemetery in Bukit Kiara, where Hamidah was also buried. ==HonourHonour of Malaysia=== * : Commander of the Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia (P.S.M.)

It lies along the Nabesna Road, a gravel road that connects it to the Tok Cut-Off at Slana.Rand McNally. The Road Atlas '08. Chicago: Rand McNally, 2008, p. 6. Its elevation is 2,979 feet (908 m). Founded by and named for the Nabesna Mining Company, the community received a post office in 1909. Located at the base of White Mountain in the Wrangell Mountains, it lies west of the Nabesna River. According to the 2010 Census, there were five people residing at this location. Gold was discovered at White Mountain in 1891, and the site was first developed in the early 20th century. Through the efforts of Carl Whitham, the Nabesna Mining Company was formed in 1929, resulting in an expansion of the camp and the construction of Nabesna Road. The mine was closed during World War II, and only briefly reopened afterward, closing permanently after Whitham died in 1947. The location was used as a secret supply cache by the United States Army during the Cold War. The mine produced of gold during its active period, as well as many tons of silver, copper, and lead. The old mining camp, now a ghost town, and the mine were listed as the Nabesna Gold Mine Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. ==Demographics== Nabesna first appeared on the 1930 U.S. Census as an unincorporated mining village. It appeared again in 1940 and 1950. It did not appear again until 2010, when it was made a census-designated place (CDP). The Nabesna mining community is not to be confused with Nabesna native village, which was located west across the Nabesna River from present-day Northway Village (CDP). It also appeared on the 1940 U.S. Census showing 85 residents. There is some confusion as to which Nabesna appeared on the 1960 U.S. Census (showing 41 residents).

His professional career began onstage at Sadler's Wells Opera, London, with appearances on BBC and at Wigmore Hall. His performing activity then widened to include musical theatre, recording, television and cabaret. In 1969 a Hollywood agency contracted him for ten years as an entertainer, leading to 15 tours of the United States, appearing in San Francisco, Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles and Las Vegas.

Apple hardware normally has a one-year limited warranty and includes 90 days of technical support by telephone. Customers can obtain extended warranty coverage and technical support, which extends the length and expands the scope of coverage and includes two instances of accidental damage repair at discounted prices in most regions by purchasing AppleCare+. The AppleCare Protection Plan is available for many Apple products including Mac computers and displays, iPhones and iPads, Apple Watches, and Apple TV. AppleCare plans include Apple software associated with the covered hardware. Customers can also buy additional support and training through AppleCare. ==AppleCare+ and AppleCare protection plans== Every AirPort, Apple Display, Apple TV, Apple Watch, iPad, iPod, iPhone, HomePod, Mac, and AirPods comes with complimentary telephone technical support and a limited warranty from Apple. The AppleCare Protection Plan and AppleCare+ extends the service coverage and provides one-stop service and support from Apple experts. The AppleCare Protection Plan is sold by Apple and its authorized resellers for Apple TV and AirPort exclusively and must be phrased at the time of purchase or AppleCare Protection Plan must be purchased within 30 days in Japan and within 60 days where available. AppleCare+ is available as an add-on purchase with every Apple Display, Apple Watch, iPad, iPod, iPhone, HomePod, Mac, and AirPods at the time of purchase; otherwise AppleCare+ or AppleCare Protection Plan must be purchased within 30 days in Japan and within 60 days where available. For all hardware devices, following the included 90-day telephone/Internet support and one-year hardware warranty, buying the AppleCare Protection Plan for a MacBook computer or a separate AppleCare Protection Plan for Apple displays extends both support and hardware to three years. Additionally, buying AppleCare+ for iPods and other iOS devices can extend both support and hardware to two years. Extended coverage under the Protection Plan is available for the Apple Watch for either two or three years, depending on the particular model of the device. The AppleCare Protection Plan extends the complimentary 90-day coverage to three years from the original device purchase date for Mac or Apple displays and two years from the given device's purchase date for iPads, iPhones, iPods, or Apple TV devices. === AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss coverage === Theft and loss coverage is only provided in Japan and the United States of America. AppleCare+ with theft and loss includes up to two incidences of accidental damage, theft or loss coverage at a reduced cost to the end consumer. Currently Theft and Loss coverage is unavailable in Europe, South America, Asia Pacific, Africa North America (Canada) or Antartica. ===Included Mac accessory coverage=== Users who purchase an AppleCare Protection Plan with any Mac computer are also automatically entitled to receive coverage for some other related Apple accessories. Along with coverage for the MacBook, any additional Apple display purchased at the same time as a Macbook device and/or any Apple AirPort device (e.g., AirPort Express Base Station, AirPort Extreme Base Station, or Time Capsule) is covered. (Note: Although the AirPort device or Time Capsule must be purchased up to two years before the MacBook purchase or during the term of the AppleCare Protection Plan coverage). ===Competition=== Today, there are several third-party warranty providers and traditional insurance providers that will also cover Apple products. Some may include accident, loss, and theft coverage as well as hardware failure warranties. Some major retailers that sell Apple products sell their own extended service plans as well. ==AppleCare Extended Service== In some countries or territories where there are no local Apple offices, such as parts of Latin America, the \\"AppleCare Extended Service\\" product is available in place of the AppleCare product. This offers the same hardware warranty without phone/Internet support. ==AppleCare and EU legislation== In some parts of European countries a part of the European Union (EU), local regulations gives consumers a minimum of two years warranty on hardware defects that existed at time of purchase, which overlaps the benefits of AppleCare. This effectively means that, in certain countries in the EU, an AppleCare Protection Plan still extends phone/Internet support from 90 days on all devices. In most countries the onus under the EU law is on the merchant to establish that a hardware defect did not exist at time of purchase for the first six months after purchase. After the six-month-period this is reversed, meaning that the customer may need to establish that a hardware defect did exist when they received the product. Unlike the statutory guarantee AppleCare also covers defects that appeared after purchase, if the device was handled correctly. AppleCare also includes an express replacement service for iPad and iPhone. AppleCare+ insures against accidental damage, unlike the statutory warranty. For Mac computers with or without any additional included covered Mac accessories, (or separately purchased Apple monitors with their own purchased Apple Protection Plan) this still extends cover to a third year from the statutory two years. ==References External links == *Apple - AppleCare products and services *Apple Products and Statutory Warranty Category:Apple Inc. services ","title":"AppleCare"},{"id":"19301368","text":"The 13 September 2008 Delhi bombings were a series of five synchronised bomb blasts that took place within a span of few minutes on Saturday, 13 September 2008 at various locations in Delhi, India.

The Indian Mujahideen claimed responsibility for the Jaipur bombings through an email sent to Indian media\\"Indian Mujahideen sends pre-blast video footage\\", India Today, 14 May 2008. and declared \\"open war\\" against India in retaliation for what it said were 60 years of Muslim persecution and the country's support of United States' policies, most notably the war in Afghanistan. The Times of India has reported that either the banned organisation Students Islamic Movement of India or the militant organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba could be behind the blasts in Bangalore. Similar to the Jaipur case, after the Ahmedabad blasts, several TV channels reported that they received e-mails from the Indian Mujahideen claiming responsibility for the terror attacks. Police say the Indian Mujahideen is an offshoot of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India, but allege that local Muslims are given training and backing from militant groups in neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh. ==Details== A map of Delhi showing the blast locationsWhere the terrorists struck in Delhi (Rediff, 14 September 2008) Five blasts took place within a span of 31 minutes from 18:07 to 18:38 ISTHT (12:37 to 13:08 UTC) in busy markets or commercial localities.

They were rushed to nearby RML hospital. The explosive was kept near a car, and resulted in a cylinder blast in an auto rickshaw, which was subsequently thrown up several feet into the air. Immediately after, two explosions took place in Connaught Place in which at least 10 people were injured. Police and witnesses said that the bombs went off in dustbins in and around Connaught Place, a shopping and dining area popular with tourists and locals in the centre of the city. The first of these blasts occurred on Barakhamba Road, near Nirmal Tower and Gopal Das Bhavan at 18:34. A minute later, the second bomb exploded in the newly constructed Central Park in the centre of the Connaught Place roundabout, built above one of the main stations of the Delhi Metro. An eyewitness reportedly saw two men place the bomb in a dustbin at Central Park. Subsequently, two explosions rocked M-Block market in Greater Kailash-I at 18:37 and 18:38 ‚Äì the first near the popular Prince Paan Corner, and the other near a Levi's store. The latter damaged 10 shops. Preliminary examination of the blast site said that low intensity ammonium nitrate tied to integrated circuits with timer devices had been used in almost all the serial blasts. Four bombs were also defused ‚Äì the first one at India Gate, the second outside Regal Cinema in Connaught Place, the third in Connaught Place, and the fourth on Parliament Street. On the evening of 13 September 2008, IBN reported at least 30 deaths and over 100 injured. AFP reported that \\"Indian police (New Delhi police spokesman Rajan Bhagat) said Sunday that 20 people were killed and close to 100 injured.\\" afp.google.com/article, 20 killed, 98 injured in Delhi bomb attacks ==ResponsePolice and security=== Security was tightened across the national capital, with police personnel fanning out to railway and Metro stations, hospitals, bus terminals, the airport and other sensitive points like cinema halls, shopping malls and religious places. Barricades were put up on most city roads to check traffic. Several major markets, including the Sarojini Nagar market, which was targeted in the previous Diwali-eve blasts in 2005, were shut down and evacuated. Cyber-caf√© owners were asked to keep a tab on customers. A Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) spokesperson state that \\"security has already been strengthened and frisking and checking of the commuters have been stepped up. The Metro is under constant vigil\\". He added that extra personnel had been pressed into service to keep an eye on commuters. ===Press confusion=== The confusion in the aftermath of the blasts was evident in the press reports immediately following. The general consensus was that the blasts had claimed 18 lives. However, there was some disparity, with CNN claiming as low as 15, to NDTV claiming as high as 30. Even after some time had passed, the numbers of people killed and injured reported by various sources varied. At the lower end, The New York Times in 2011 reported the death toll as \\"more than 20 people\\", and The Hindu noted that number of deaths as \\"at least 25\\". Meanwhile, a 2010 report by the Centre for Land Warfare Studies indicates 26 dead and 100 injured, and a 2009 article by the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses claims 30 dead and nearly 90 injured. In 2018, NDTV was still reporting 30 dead and 100 injured, but The Times of India was putting the number of injuries at 135. There was also some controversy over blast sites and the sites where bombs were defused, most notably Zee News reporting a bomb being defused at Central Park, while the Outlook Magazine stated that the park itself was a bomb site. == Responsibility == The Islamist \\"Indian Mujahideen\\" sent an e-mail to all major TV channels, informing them of the blasts just after the first one occurred. In the case of the bomb blasts in Jaipur, and Ahmedabad, e-mails were sent before the blasts. The email was sent from Arbi Hindi. The email threatened nine blasts. A 13-page attached document depicts photographs of the previous blasts under the caption \\"our jihad\\". The Delhi blasts are, according to the email, a direct reaction to the raids carried on and after the Ahmedabad blasts, and \\"harassments imposed by your (Indian) ATS and the police on the innocent Muslims\\". The document also mentions Amarnath dispute, violence against Christians in Orissa, Babri Masjid demolition and Gujarat riots. The email was traced to Chembur, an eastern suburb of Mumbai. Mumbai's anti- Terrorism squad (ATS) confirmed that WiFi of the owner firm \\"Kamran Power\\" was hacked and used for sending the mail. Reports claim that the Indian Mujahideen called this operation \\"Operation B-A-D\\", encompassing the Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Delhi Bombings. Intelligence officials had intercepted a call made \\"from the across the border\\" claiming \\"Operation BAD is successful\\", after the Ahmedabad blasts, which the Gujarat police that interpreted as Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Delhi, though the dates and specific places were not known. ==Investigation== Two persons were detained from Connaught Place area soon after the blasts. Delhi Police said an 11-year-old boy had claimed to have seen the perpetrators; he informed police that the suspects, clad in black kurta-pyjamas, were seen placing bags in a dustbin. The Delhi Police soon, within three hours of the blast, arrested another person who the police suspect to be the mastermind of the blast. Preliminary investigation by police reveal Indian Mujahideen-SIMI cell led by Abdul Subhan Qureshi alias Tauqir, having information technology background from Mumbai, to be involved. Another person named Qayamuddin is also under investigation. Four more people have also been detained and questioned. In the morning of 19 September, the Batla House encounter took place, in which Delhi Police shot down two persons, thought to be suspects, hiding in L-18 block of Jamia Nagar, Delhi. Two others suspects were arrested while one managed to escape. Bashir alias Atif, believed to be the mastermind was one of the two killed. Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma, who was injured in the encounter, died in a hospital. He was credited with helping to have killed 35 terror suspects, 85 arrests and also the winner of 75-odd encounters, 150 medals and seven gallantry awards. Later, the intelligence team said that the arrested allegedly had links with Dubai and further questioned if they had any link with Dawood Ibrahim. On 23 September, the police arrested five more people from Mumbai and Uttar Pradesh. All five are suspected to be part of the Indian Mujahadeen's think tank. The men were: *Sadiq Sheikh, 31, software engineer from Mumbai *Afzal Usmani, 32, hotelier in western suburbs of Mumbai *Arif Sheikh, 38, electrician from Mumbra, Mumbai *Mohammed Zakir Sheikh, 38, scrap dealer from Mumbra, Mumbai *Mohammed Ansar Sheikh, 31, software Engineer from Mumbai On 4 October they were sent by the judicial Chief Metropolitan Magistrate to 12 days' policy custody. The crime branch has claimed that these are the operatives who had introduced themselves as Pakistanis to perpetrators of 11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings. After the 2006 bombings, police had claimed that a group of SIMI terrorists along with five Pakistan nationals had planted bombs in seven trains. On 11 November, the Madhya Pradesh Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) arrested Qayamuddin Kapadia, a top- ranking member of SIMI and a key conspirator and executor of the Ahmedabad attack. Police claimed that Kapadia admitted his involvement in the Ahmedabad blasts, and that he, along with Abdul Subhan Qureshi alias Tauqeer of Mumbai and Riaz Bhatkal of Karnataka, collaborated with the SIMI cell led by Atif to carry out the Delhi blasts. Atif was later killed in an encounter with Delhi Police. In January 2018, Delhi police arrested Qureshi after a gun battle. ==See also== *List of terrorist incidents, 2008 ==References== Category:21st- century mass murder in India Category:Mass murder in 2008 Category:Terrorist incidents in India in 2008 Category:Improvised explosive device bombings in India Category:Islamic terrorism in India Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in 2008 Category:2010s in Delhi Category:Filmed improvised explosive device bombings Category:2000s in Delhi Category:Crime in Delhi Category:Indian Mujahideen attacks ","title":"13 September 2008 Delhi bombings"},{"id":"19301376","text":"Charles McCoy may refer to: * Charlie McCoy (born 1941), American harmonica player * Papa Charlie McCoy (1909‚Äì1950), American blues musician * Charlie McCoy (cyclist) (born 1937), British Olympic cyclist * C.

Other common names include cat's foot and mountain everlasting. It is widespread across much of Canada including all three Arctic territories, as well as Greenland, the western and north-central United States, and the Mexican State of Baja California.Biota of North America Program 2014 state-level distribution mapTropicos, specimen listing for Antennaria rosea Greene Antennaria rosea is a plant of many habitats, from dry to wet climates and low elevation to very high. It is a very morphologically diverse species; individuals can look very different. It is polyploid and exhibits apomixis; most all the plants are female and they reproduce asexually.Bayer, R. J. (1989). A taxonomic revision of the Antennaria rosea (Asteraceae: Inuleae: Gnaphaliinae) polyploid complex. Brittonia 41:1 53-60. This herbaceous perennial grows to a height of 10 and 40 centimeters. It has a network of short stolons by which it spreads, its method of vegetative reproduction. It forms a basal patch of woolly grayish leaves 1 to 4 centimeters long. The inflorescence contains several flower heads in a cluster. Each head is lined with wide, pointed phyllaries which are often rose in color, the trait that gives the species its name, but they may also be white, yellowish, or brownish. The species is dioecious, but since most of the individuals are female, most bear flower heads containing pistillate flowers. The fruit is an achene with a body less than 2 millimeters long and a pappus which may be 6 or 7 millimeters long. The plant often produces fertile seeds, but most individuals in most populations are clones.Bayer, R. J. (1990) Patterns of clonal diversity in the Antennaria rosea (Asteraceae) polyploid agamic complex. American Journal of Botany 77:10 1313-19. Plants are sometimes fertilized with pollen from other Antennaria species, which may bring new genes into an A. rosea population, increasing the genetic diversity amongst the clones.Flora of North America, Antennaria rosea In the UK Antennaria rosea has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. ;Subspecies *Antennaria rosea subsp. arida (E.E.Nelson) R.J.Bayer *Antennaria rosea subsp. confinis (Greene) R.J.Bayer *Antennaria rosea subsp. pulvinata (Greene) R.J.Bayer *Antennaria rosea subsp. rosea ==References *Jepson Manual Treatment *United States Department of Agriculture Plants Profile *Calphotos Photo gallery, University of California *Calflora taxon report, University of California, Antennaria rosea E.

The Contents of this book include four parts entitled \\"Anancy Stories\\", \\"Digging Sings\\", \\"Ring Tunes\\", and \\"Dancing Tunes\\". Each part has an introduction, songs, stories, and melodies. ==Part 1: Anancy stories== Includes 51 items, such as the story and melody \\"Leah and Tiger\\" (item 36, pages 108‚Äì9). The heading refers to a legendary figure, Anancy, or Anansi, the Ashanti word for \\"spider\\" and the name of a folktale character. Anancy stories and certain musical characteristics originated in West Africa. ==Part 2: Digging sings== Includes 37 items, such as \\"The one shirt I have\\" (item 58, page 164). The heading refers to the digging of holes for the planting of yams. \\"Nothing more joyous can be imagined,\\" writes Jekyll, \\"than a good 'digging-sing' from twenty throats, with the pickers‚Äîso they call their pickaxes‚Äîfalling in regular beat.\\" Digging sings included songs sung during many kinds of labour. A feature of several digging sings is the bobbin. Jekyll explains, \\"One man starts or 'raises' the tune and the others come in with the 'bobbin,' the short refrain...\\" In the song \\"Miss Nancy Ray\\", for example, the bobbin is: \\"Oh hurrah, boys!\\" Bobbins resemble and perhaps stemmed from a common manner of singing of work songs in Africa. ==Part 3: Ring tunes== Includes 28 items, such as \\"Ring a number \\" (item 92, page 194). These tunes were sung by boys and girls holding hands to form a ring. ==Part 4: Dancing tunes== Includes 80 items, such as \\"Fan me, soldierman\\" (item 125, pae 223), and Carry me Ackee go Linstead market\\" (item 121, pages 219‚Äì220). During the 1970s, Oxford University Press published six collections of Jamaican folks songs arranged and annotated by Dr. Olive Lewin. Her book, Rock It Come Over: the Folk Music of Jamaica, describes Jekyll's 1907 book as \\"very well researched,\\" but she gives examples of occasional errors. She concludes that \\"although Jekyll's interest extended beyond music to Jamaican folklore, it was by his considerable knowledge as a musician that he made the most valuable contribution to this all too neglected field of scholarship.\\" In her book Forty Folk Songs of Jamaica, Lewin classifies the songs into 11 groups: Bruckins, Jankunnu, Kumina, Maroon, Mento, Nagos, Rasta (Rastafarian), Revival, (Set-Up; Gerreh), Tambo, and Worksongs. Of these, mento is by far the most common. However, much of mento is of relatively recent origin and should be classified as popular music rather than folk. Linkages from folk music to mento are described in Daniel T. Neely's dissertation, Mento, Jamaica's Original Music: Development, Tourism and the Nationalist Frame (New York University, 2007). Among the best known Jamaican folk songs are \\"Day-O (Banana Boat Song)\\", \\"Jamaica Farewell\\" (Iron Bar), and \\"Linstead Market\\". The first two of these were popularized by Harry Belafonte. The third has come a long way since its appearance among Jekyll's 108 Jamaican folk songs. Not only has \\"Linstead Market\\" been arranged for solo voice and piano and for performance by choirs, but also, it was arranged for congregational singing in 1975 and now appears in at least five hymnals. == References == * Leroy M.

Rumiko Takahashi's manga series Ranma ¬Ω was adapted into two anime series: Ranma ¬Ω which ran on Fuji TV for 18 episodes and Ranma ¬Ω Nett≈çhen which ran for 143. The first TV series was canceled due to low ratings in September 1989 (despite its low ratings, the first 18-episode series is considered by some Western fans to be the franchise's creative high point), but was then brought back in December as the much more popular and much longer-running Ranma ¬Ω Nett≈çhen. Viz Media licensed both anime for English dubs and labeled them as one. They released them in North America in seven DVD collections they call \\"seasons\\". The first 22 episodes of Nett≈çhen are season 2, which was given the titled \\"Anything-Goes Martial Arts\\". The ordering of several episodes was also re-arranged, effectively putting them closer to the order they appear in the original manga. The introductory piece \\"Ranma You Pervert\\" is the lone opening theme for the first 6 episodes and for episodes 14 to 22.

He represented the school in the first XI for four years, was captain in 1916 & 1917, adjudged best fielder in 1915 & 1916 and topped the batting average in 1917. He rowed in the first VIII for three years, played tennis, won at athletics and was school swimming champion and school captain in 1917. He played in the school's rugby first XV for three years and was the best back in 1916 and 1917. ==The Great War & university== In 1918 he was a gunner in France with the 12th Field Artillery Brigade of the AIF. After the war he commenced a science degree at the University of Queensland. He represented Queensland in rugby union in 1919 the final year before the sport massively lost its popularity to rugby league prompting the Queensland Rugby Union hiatus that lasted until 1929. In 1920 he transferred to Sydney University to pursue his medical studies at St. Andrew's College. He played rugby at the Sydney University club. He won a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford University in 1922 residing at New College. He played sixty games in 1922-23 for Oxford, Blackheath, New College and the Barbarians. In 1924 he became the first capped Australian to play for Leicester Tigers, he played one game for the club at home against Bristol. He was selected to captain the Oxford side but was challenged for having played rugby league in his career. He represented Oxford in athletics, swimming and water polo. ==Representative career== Tom Lawton in action against England at Twickenham, 7 Jan 1928 His representative debut was in 1920 when selected for the New South Wales Waratahs to appear against the All Blacks. He scored a try and kicked three goals in his representative debut. With no Queensland Rugby Union competition in place at that time the New South Wales Waratahs were the top Australian representative rugby union side of the period and a number of Waratah matches of the 1920s played against full international opponents were in 1986 decreed by the Australian Rugby Union as Test matches. After returning to Sydney from Oxford in 1925 he was immediately given the captaincy of New South Wales for the 1925 tour to New Zealand. He played as captain in nine of the eleven games and top scored with 49 points. Lawton spent 1926 in the New South Wales, Southern Riverina district on business and played Australian Rules Football in the Deniliquin Football Association with the East End Football Club that lost the grand final to the Colts Football Club. Lawton was selected for the 1927-28 Waratahs tour of Britain, France and Canada. He played in 27 matches of the tour exceeded only by Wylie Breckenbridge (29), and Alex Ross (29). He was the top point scorer (124 points) and played in all five Test matches of the tour. In 1929 the All Blacks toured Australia, Lawton captained the first truly national Wallabies side fielded since 1914 which was the first national side in history to beat the All Blacks 3-0 in a series whitewash. When the British and Irish Lions toured Australia in 1930 he captained the Wallabies, Queensland and an invitational XV against them. His representative career ended in 1932 aged 33 years after he led Australia and Queensland against the touring All Blacks. ==Rugby lineage== In 2007 Lawton was honoured in the third tranche of inductees into the Australian Rugby Union Hall of Fame. His grandsons Tom Jnr and Rob also both became Wallabies - Rob as a Prop forward made four test appearances from 1988 to 1989, Tom Jnr a Hooker earned 41 caps between 1983 and 1989. In 2007 he was honoured in the third set of inductees into the Australian Rugby Union Hall of Fame, and in 2013 he was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame. ==ReferencesSources=== * Collection (1995) Gordon Bray presents The Spirit of Rugby, Harper Collins Publishers Sydney * Howell, Max (2005) Born to Lead - Wallaby Test Captains, Celebrity Books, Auckland NZ * Lawton Family History from original source records. ===Footnotes=== Category:1899 births Category:1978 deaths Category:Australian rugby union players Category:Australia international rugby union players Category:Australian rugby union captains Category:Barbarian F.C. players Category:Leicester Tigers players Category:World Rugby Hall of Fame inductees Category:Oxford University RFC players Category:Alumni of New College, Oxford ","title":"Tom Lawton Snr"},{"id":"19301492","text":"Zoran Jelikiƒá (; born August 4, 1954) is a former Serbian football player.

B√ºrgenstock is also a resort located at 874 m a.s.l. on the same mountain. The lookout point at the summit of the B√ºrgenstock, the Hammetschwand, offers an extensive view, for the mountain is almost entirely surrounded by Lake Lucerne. The small resort B√ºrgenstock can be reached by a road as well as with the B√ºrgenstock Funicular which starts from the boat landing pier at Kehrsiten-B√ºrgenstock on Lake Lucerne. The highest summit of the B√ºrgenstock can be reached from the resort by foot and by means of a cliff-side path followed by the Hammetschwand Elevator. The new B√ºrgenstock resort featuring 30 buildings, including three hotels with around 400 rooms (800 beds), 68 Residence Suites and 12 restaurants and bars is under construction. Of the total investment of CHF 485 million, CHF 320 million has already been expended. It reopens 2017. == Description == When looked at from Lucerne, the B√ºrgenstock has the typical mountain shape of a \\"stock\\".:de:Stock (Geologie) Wikipedia German: \\"Stock\\" Especially in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, the term \\"Stock\\" is used for a number of mountains whose shape of summits is clearly set off from the bulk. A good example is Stockh√ºtte :de:Massiv Wikipedia German: \\"Massiv\\" The term B√ºrgenstock, composed of the descriptive words \\"B√ºrgen\\" and \\"Stock\\", has evolved since the mid-19th century into the geographical name for the distinctive mountain on the \\"B√ºrgen\\" peninsula as seen from Lucerne. From the early Middle Ages on, the mountain on this peninsula was called B√ºrgenberg; an arbitral settlement from the year 1378, putting an end to over 38 years of dispute between the estates Lucerne and Nidwalden about the affiliation of the region extending from Kehrsiten to Mattgrat, uses the name B√ºrgenberg in its records. Old maps and frontier records of the Corporation of Lucerne which mention the ‚Äì in those times ‚Äì disputed forest call it the Stadtwald am B√ºrgenberg (forest on the B√ºrgenberg) or B√ºrgenbergwald (B√ºrgen mountain forest).Odermatt, Frey-F√ºrst: Das Buch vom B√ºrgenstock, 1948, S. 113 On the Dufourkarte (Dufour Map), the topographic map of Switzerland from 1844 to 1864,:de:Topographische Karte der Schweiz Topographic map of Switzerland the mountain ridge as a whole had no name. The highest crest was referred to as Hametschwand. The geographical name B√ºrgenstock was first documented in the year 1836 by Aloys Businger in his book ‚ÄúDer Kanton Unterwalden‚Äù. Businger calls the entire B√ºrgen peninsula the B√ºrgenberg; however, he refers to the highest elevation both as Hammetschwand and B√ºrgenstock.Aloys Businger: Der Kanton Unterwalden, 1836, S. 29 und S. 154Odermatt, Frey-F√ºrst: Das Buch vom B√ºrgenstock, 1948, S. 115 In addition, in the year 1850, the Director of the Lucerne Teacher's Training College Niklaus Rietschi published a private map, in which the terms B√ºrgenstock together with the term Hammetschwand are recorded for the summit.Odermatt, Frey-F√ºrst: Das Buch vom B√ºrgenstock, 1948, S. 115 In 1872, the company Bucher & Durrer laid the foundation for the hotel complex on the Alp Tritt. For this purpose, it chose the already existing geographical name of B√ºrgenstock, also documented in 1836 by Aloys Businger in his book ‚ÄúDer Kanton Unterwalden‚Äù.Aloys Businger: Der Kanton Unterwalden, 1836, S. 29 und S. 154 The first official map to use the geographical name B√ºrgenstock was the so- called ‚ÄúSiegfriedkarte‚Äù Siegfried Map, whose publication, started by the Federal Topographic Bureau under Hermann Siegfried,:de:Hermann Siegfried Wikipedia German: \\"Hermann Siegfried\\" continued from 1870 until 1926. The name B√ºrgenstock appears on sheet 377 of the Siegfried Map and dates back to 1896. Siegfriedkarte: Blatt 377, 1896, in der Kartensammlung des Schweizerischen Bundesamtes f√ºr Landestopografie, besucht am 09. Dezember 2012 Around 1900, the designation B√ºrgenstock established itself as a general colloquial term for the entire mountain ridge, from Stansstad in the West to \\"Untere Nase\\" in the East. A corresponding entry in the \\"Geographischen Lexikon der Schweiz\\" (Geographical Dictionary of Switzerland) can be found in 1910.B√ºrgenstock in: Geographisches Lexikon der SCHWEIZ, 1902-1910 In the Swiss maps of our days, the name B√ºrgenstock designates the mountain ridge ‚Äì with the term Hammetschwand as alternative ‚Äì as well as the location of the hotel and residential complex. B√ºrgenstock as a geographical name can be found twice in the official Swiss index of cities and towns.Ortschaftenverzeichnis der Schweiz S. 79 und 80, heruntergeladen am 5. Februar 2010 The locality B√ºrgenstock is listed in the postal code listing of Switzerland under the postal code 6363.PLZ-Verzeichnis der Schweiz und des F√ºrstentums Liechtenstein Today, the residential streets of the valley communities Stansstad and Ennetb√ºrgen, connecting the entire mountain ridge, carry the name B√ºrgenstockstrasse. The almost vertical north face of the B√ºrgenstock with Hammetschwand Elevator visible on the top == Geographical situation == The B√ºrgenstock is a mountain ridge that stretches over 10 km and is surrounded to the north, east and southeast by Lake Lucerne. The northern slope drops very steeply into the lake. On and at the bottom of the southern slope is the township of Ennetb√ºrgen; Stansstad is situated at the bottom of the western end. For the most part, the mountain belongs to the municipality of Ennetb√ºrgen in the canton of Nidwalden. The western part belongs to the municipality of Stansstad. A part of the northern steep drop into the lake is an exclave of the city of Lucerne and is called B√ºrgenberg (aka citizen's mountain).:de:Exklave B√ºrgenstock \\"Wikipedia Deutsch: \\"Exklave B√ºrgenstock\\" == Geology == Geologically, the B√ºrgenstock belongs to the foothills of the Pilatus and the Helvetic border chain. The rocks are from the Cretaceous and Tertiary. Below the Hammetschwand, the following layers can be distinguished on the north side: siliceous limestone, Drusberg layers (forming a forest belt), bright Schrattenkalk limestone with orbitolina layers overlaid by Seewerkalk limestone. Above this there is a transgression of Assilina Greensand and Nummulitic limestone of the Lutetian age, which is found mainly on the southern downward slope with its gentler incline.Hantke Ren√©, Geologischer F√ºhrer der Schweiz, Exkursion 32, Basel 1967. During the last ice age, the B√ºrgenstock was completely covered by an ice stream flowing from the Gotthard into the foothills of the Alps. Abrasion marks left by the ice on the limestone are found including in the highest altitudes. Large granite boulders which were transported by the ice from the Gotthard, are distributed over the whole mountain, as for example an 18 m3 large, round specimen on a steep slope on the Allw√§gli land reserve, which in 1949 was placed under protection. After the regression of the ice, the B√ºrgenstock was at first an island in Lake Lucerne. In the course of a few thousand years, however, the Engelberger Aa River filled up the area between the Engelberger valley entrance and the B√ºrgenstock with sediments, creating today's flat valley between the townships Ennetb√ºrgen, Buochs, Stans and Stansstad. == Tourism == Home to a number of luxury hotels and a conference centre, the B√ºrgenstock has been a popular holiday and conferencing destination since 1872. Also located on the B√ºrgenstock is Europe's tallest outdoor lift: the Hammetschwand Lift connects the beautiful scenic cliff path with the Hammetschwand vantage point, from where extensive views of Lake Lucerne and the surrounding mountains are to be had. A protection plan is in place for the B√ºrgenstock to safeguard its testimony to Switzerland's post-Second World War tourism heritage. Alongside the Grand Hotel and Palace Hotel, this comprises numerous smaller buildings erected in the 1950s and 1960s. The Office of Historical Monuments of the canton of Nidwalden, the owners, Nidwalden's cantonal council (in NW: ) and the municipality's government sought successfully to preserve the historical buildings by establishing a committee mandated with developing a master plan to place the buildings under heritage protection. The historical weather station has since been relocated to a different site. The Grand Hotel, the oldest establishment in the B√ºrgenstock Resort, has undergone partial demolition, although its facade is now being rebuilt to match the original and the interior features a new, up-to-date room layout. From a historical perspective, it was deemed important that the B√ºrgenstock resort should continue to make its presence felt within the Lake Lucerne region through its distinctive silhouette, and be kept as an ensemble of buildings.Gerettete Kleinode auf dem B√ºrgenstock. In: Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, 26 July 2014. Retrieved on 7 August 2014. == History of the hotel complex == In 1871 the Bucher & Durrer Company, domiciled in Kerns, bought Alp Tritt on Mount B√ºrgenberg. The company named its new hotel venture \\"B√ºrgenstock\\". The Hotel Kurhaus, later called the Grand Hotel, opened on 23 June 1873. A small hydroelectric power plant on the Engelberger Aa river was built in Buochs in 1886/7 to power the B√ºrgenstock funicular railway and the Stanserhorn aerial cableway. The railway commenced operations in 1888, as did the hotel's own water supply. That same year saw the opening of the Park Hotel. The B√ºrgenstock Chapel dates from 1897. The Palace Hotel opened in 1904, and a number of villas emerged east of it between 1900 and 1905. The Hammetschwand Lift was inaugurated in 1905. Friedrich Frey-F√ºrst bought the B√ºrgenstock hotels in 1925. The period 1925 to 1948 saw the three hotels subjected to thoroughgoing renovations and the golf course opened in 1928. Friedrich Frey- F√ºrst died in 1953, at which point his son Fritz Frey took charge under whose direction various structural and infrastructural changes were made. During his tenure and that of his family, celebrities including actors Sophia Loren, Audrey Hepburn and Sean Connery and politicians such as Jimmy Carter and Henry Kissinger stayed as guests at the hotels. The family sold the B√ºrgenstock Resort to the UBS in 1996. It was acquired in 2000 by Richemont H√©ritage SA of Vich, Canton Vaud together with five other five-star hotels indebted to the UBS to the tune of some CHF 115 million. The company changed its name to Rosebud Hotels Holding SA in 2003 after disposing of its eponymous Hotel Richemont. The Barwa Real Estate Company, domiciled in the Emirate of Qatar, took up a 50% holding in the company's assets in 2007 which, alongside the B√ºrgenstock hotels, comprised the Schweizerhof in Bern and the Royal-Savoy in Lausanne. On separating from Rosebud Hotels Holding SA in 2008, the Barwa Real Estate Company became sole proprietor of the B√ºrgenstock Resort. There followed a new concept under manager Bruno H. Sch√∂pfer. In 2009 the Barwa Real Estate Company transferred its Swiss hotel portfolio to the Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company, which is wholly owned by the State of Qatar; its subsidiary, QDHP Swiss Management AG, became responsible for managing the hotel projects. Katara Hospitality, a subsidiary of the Qatar Investment Authority ‚Äì the State of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund ‚Äì became the new investor in 2011.Ein Berg erwacht. In: Bilanz (magazine), 30 August 2013. Retrieved on 18 August 2014. The same year saw the launch of the B√ºrgenstock Selection brand identity, which incorporates the new B√ºrgenstock Resort, the Hotel Royal-Savoy in Lausanne and the Hotel Schweizerhof in Bern. The Swiss activities were transferred in 2012 to Katara Hospitality Switzerland AG; domiciled in Zug, the company operates the hotels in Switzerland. Since 2013, 72 of the 74 building licences applied for have been issued and more than CHF 120 million invested. The Hotel Honegg has been renovated and reopened in 2011.Die Legende wird wiederbelebt.

In spring 2004, B√ºrgenstock was site to negotiations between Turkish and Greek Cypriots on the issue of accession to the EU. == Culture == The 19th century B√ºrgenstock Chapel is located in immediate vicinity of the hotels and at the beginning of the cliff path on the B√ºrgenstock. It is still owned by the former hotelier family Frey who left their mark on the B√ºrgenstock hotels from 1925 to 1997, as well as the non-profit Frey-F√ºrst Foundation. The B√ºrgenstock Chapel is a replica of the chapel of St. Jost which lies on the slopes of the B√ºrgenstock Mountain on the territory of the township of Ennetb√ºrgen and is the oldest Gothic sanctuary in the Swiss canton of Nidwaldens. The B√ºrgenstock Chapel was built in 1897 under the orders of Countess Tancr√®de de la Baume, n√©e Pozzo di Borgo, who had set up her summer residence in the hotel village on the B√ºrgenstock. Among other things, she had an ornate wooden, polychrome Gothic ceiling reproduced in detail in the chapel. Further elements of interior design and decoration are also replicas from the 17th century and are from different churches in Switzerland. The sculpture \\"Dance of Death\\" by the Swiss sculptor Hans J√∂rg Limbach (1928-1990) is located directly next to the chapel. The B√ºrgenstock Chapel also became famous because of the wedding of actress Audrey Hepburn with Mel Ferrer in 1954. The rich cultural tradition established in the 19th and 20th centuries on the B√ºrgenstock is continued today by several private and independent cultural organisations: On 13 November 2009, the \\"B√ºrgenstock Kunst- und Kulturstiftung\\" (B√ºrgenstock Foundation of Art and Culture) - located in Ennetb√ºrgen - was founded to preserve historical furniture and antiques from the hotels built in the 19th century on the B√ºrgenstock. in: Nidwaldner Zeitung, July 17th, 2012 Around 8000 people visited the special exhibition Artikel Erfolgreiche Ausstellung.

Following financial difficulties and several changes of ownership, the company was dissolved in 2015. ==History== Allied Carpets, Crown Point Retail Park, Leeds. (2009) It was formed by Harold Plotnek on market stalls in Birmingham in the 1950s. In the end of the 1950s, a warehouse was opened in Birmingham. In the beginning of the 1970s, he joined with Leon Fisher George Morris and Mayer Myers each of whom operated independent carpet stores and they came together under the name Allied Carpets. The company floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1971. It was the first carpet retailer to open very large stores on busy main roads, often after redeveloping former car showrooms. Previously carpet stores were small and only had sample books to show. Allied's difference was that they were large, with rolls of carpet stocked in the stores and large stocks at a central warehouse, enabling them to supply almost instantly. Beds were introduced in 1972, with a dedicated bedding store in Birmingham. In 1973, with over twenty large stores throughout the country, Allied took over Williams Furniture, a high street chain with over eighty stores. To facilitate rapid expansion, in 1974, a head office and major distribution centre was opened in West Bromwich. In 1978, it was bought by the Asda Group. In 1980, curtains were introduced. In 1985, the company was rebranded as just Allied. A Contracts Division and an Insurance Replacement Division were started in that year, and upholstery products were first sold. By 1989, the company had over 180 shops, and the company officially changed its name to the Allied Maples Group Ltd. At the height of its powers, the chain had a large cultural currency in Great Britain. It was alluded to in Reeves and Mortimer's comedy song 'My Rose Has Left Me' and in One Foot in the Grave, in which the protagonist expressed his desire to have his ashes scattered in a branch of Allied Carpets to register his dissatisfaction with its customer service. A customer's attempt to enact a similar request was dismissed by the High Court in 1997. ===Sale to Carpetland=== In December 1993, it was sold by the Asda Group to Carpetland. Carpetland traded as Carpetland Carpet Centres Ltd, and had financially collapsed in 1990, resulting in a management buyout in August 1991, which resulted in the company having eighty five stores. At the time of the Allied sale, it had about half as many stores as Allied. The company, after the sale, had about 250 stores. The Allied head office in West Bromwich was closed in March 1994. The company's name was changed from Carpetland to Allied Carpets. The upholstery part of the company was closed and it just sold carpets. ===Public offering=== In July 1996, it was listed on the London Stock Exchange. At this point, the company was valued at about ¬£200m. The company also owned Carpetland. ===Financial irregularities=== In July 1998, the company had its shares suspended when financial irregularities were recorded in some of the sales figures from its stores. This came from the practice of recording sales when they had been made, instead of after the carpets had been fitted. The managing director, Ray Nethercott, resigned in April 1999. Twenty-seven stores, including some of Carpetland, were bought by Carpetright in November 1998 for ¬£12m. ===Sale to Tapis Saint-Maclou=== In September 1999, it was bought for ¬£84m by Tapis Saint-Maclou of Wattrelos, France; they are France's largest carpet retailer. At the same time, TS-M bought of Aachen, Germany, who also own Ihr Teppichfreund. In 2001, it opened thirty more out of town retail warehouse stores. ===Media Agency=== Allied appointed the7stars as their media planning and buying agency in January 2010. ==Administration== Harrogate (2008) In December 2008, it appointed Lazard, the investment bank, to find a buyer for its stores. On 17 July 2009, it was announced that the company (Allied Carpets Properties) had entered administration. Allied was one of several high-profile chains to fall into receivership during the recession of this time. The administrators BDO Stoy Hayward immediately sold 51 of the company's 217 stores, and the insurance part of the business to Allied Carpets Retail Limited. This secured four hundred jobs, and saving the company from going the same way as other retail giants, including MFI, Woolworths and Zavvi. Among the casualties was the store at Merry Hill Shopping Centre in the West Midlands, which closed over that summer after twenty three years in operation ‚Äì having been one of the first retailers to take advantage of the Enterprise Zone, that was designated in the area to relieve high unemployment, when it opened that store in 1986. The store has since been taken over by HomeSense. On 21 April 2012, it was announced that the company had entered administration again. On 24 April 2012, it announced that the company had been sold, to a company affiliated with Floors-2-Go. This was in a pre pack administration deal. ==Structure== The company was based at Allied House, 76 High Street, Orpington in the London Borough of Bromley, near the junction of the A208 and A224. In Scotland, it ran the General George brand of shops. ==See also== * Carpetright * Floors-2-Go ==ReferencesFinancial scandal in April 1999 * Shares suspended in July 1998 * Competition Commission (PDF) Category:Carpet retailers of the United Kingdom Category:Companies based in the London Borough of Bromley Category:Retail companies based in London Category:Defunct retail companies of the United Kingdom Category:British companies disestablished in 2015 ","title":"Allied Carpets"},{"id":"19301628","text":"Adam Grad (10 September 1969 ‚Äì 7 February 2015) was a Polish professional footballer who played as a striker for many clubs in Poland, playing in the Ekstraklasa for ≈ÅKS ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Olimpia Pozna≈Ñ and Lechia Gda≈Ñsk, and played in the Turkish S√ºper Lig for Kayserispor. ==External links== * * * Profile at Kayserispor.org Category:1969 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Polish footballers Category:Polish expatriate footballers Category:Ekstraklasa players Category:S√ºper Lig players Category:Kayserispor footballers Category:≈ÅKS ≈Å√≥d≈∫ players Category:Lechia Gda≈Ñsk players Category:Jagiellonia Bia≈Çystok players Category:Aluminium Konin players Category:M≈Çawianka M≈Çawa players Category:Korona Kielce players Category:Pogo≈Ñ Stasz√≥w players Category:Siarka Tarnobrzeg players Category:Association football forwards Category:Sportspeople from ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Category:Expatriate footballers in Turkey Category:Polish expatriate sportspeople in Turkey ","title":"Adam Grad"},{"id":"19301635","text":"H12, H-12 or H.12 may refer to: ; In military: * Bell H-12, a 1946 American military utility helicopter * HMS Achates (H12), a 1929 United Kingdom Royal Navy A-class destroyer * HMS H12, a 1915 United Kingdom Royal Navy H class submarine ; In transportation: * Curtiss H.12, a 1916 American Curtiss Model H flying boat variant * London Buses route H12, a Transport for London contracted bus route * Highway H12 (Ukraine), a road in Ukraine * LSWR H12 class, a British LSWR Locomotive model ","title":"H12"},{"id":"19301636","text":"John Palm (13 June 1885 - 24 February 1925) was a Cura√ßao-born composer. ==Biography== Johan Antoine Palm‚Äîbetter known as John Palm‚Äîwas a grandson of Jan Gerard Palm (1831-1906), who is often referred to as the \\"father of Cura√ßao classical music\\".

Lloyd played well and gave the Springbok halves, Freddie Luyt and Uncle Dobbin a difficult match, though the tourists class shone through to win the game comfortably.Billot (1974), pg 76. A scrum-half, Lloyd was first capped for Wales in a winning game against Scotland on 1 February 1913. The game was played at Inverleith and both sides had a sparsity of international experience; though Wales were captained by the veteran Billy Trew. Lloyd played in the next six consecutive games in the 1913 and 1914 Five Nations Championships, which saw Wales finish second to England in both tournaments.

Milin finished secondary school in Leningrad and matriculated at the Faculty for Mathematics and Mechanics in Leningrad State University. In 1941, because of the outbreak of the war with Germany, he was transferred to continue his studies at the Red Army Air Force Academy in Leningrad, which he graduated from in 1944 with distinction with qualifications of a mathematician and mechanical engineer and in a military rank of an Air Force officer. From this moment and his entire life Milin had been successfully working in various educational and research institutions. Under the scientific supervision of G.M. Goluzin (1906‚Äì-1952), Milin wrote a Candidate of Science Dissertation (Ph.D. thesis) that he successfully defended in 1950. In 1964 I.M. Milin defended his Doctoral Dissertation (habilitation). Both his dissertations dealt with development and applications of methods of the Geometric Theory of Functions of Complex Variable. In 1976 after his honorable discharge from the Soviet Air Force I.M. Milin became the head of the laboratory of algorithmization and automation of technological processes at a Leningrad Research Institute ‚ÄúMECHANOBR‚Äù. ==Scientific results== Milin‚Äôs research mostly deals with an important part of complex analysis: theory of regular and meromorphic univalent functions including problems for Taylor and Loran coefficients. Milin's area theorem and coefficient estimates, as well as Milin‚Äôs functionals, Milin‚Äôs Tauberian theorem, Milin‚Äôs constant, Lebedev‚ÄìMilin inequalities are widely known. In 1949 I.M. Milin and Nikolai Andreevich Lebedev proved a notable Rogozinskij's conjecture (1939) on coefficients of Bieberbach-Eilenberg functions. In 1964 exploring the famous Bieberbach conjecture (1916) Milin seriously improved the known coefficient estimate for univalent functions. Milin‚Äôs monograph ‚ÄúUnivalent functions and orthonormal systems‚Äù (1971) includes the author‚Äôs results and thoroughly covers all the achievements on systems of regular functions orthonormal with respect to area obtained by then. There Milin also constructed a sequence of logarithmic functionals (Milin‚Äôs functionals) on the basic class of univalent functions S, conjecturing them to be non-positive for any function of this class and showed that his conjecture implied Bieberbach‚Äôs. In 1984 Louis de Branges proved Milin‚Äôs conjecture and, therefore, the Bieberbach conjecture. The second Milin‚Äôs conjecture on logarithmic coefficients published in 1983 is still an open problem. I.M. Milin devoted many years of his scientific life for active research, development, and applications of methods of analysis and optimization for solving engineering problems. He made important contributions to practical applications of mathematical methods for solving problems of automatization of processes of ore enrichment. He authored several text-books for engineers. ==Medals and awards== I.M. Milin was honored by fourteen Government awards including the medals ‚ÄúFor Fighting Merit‚Äù and ‚ÄúFor the Victory over Germany in the Great Patriotic War of 1941 -1945.‚Äù ==Selected works== *Milin I.M., Lebedev N.A.

This was one of three episodes (along with \\"Road to Germany\\" and \\"Family Gay\\") submitted the year Family Guy was nominated for the \\"Outstanding Comedy Series\\". ==Plot== The family goes to Nifty Fifties Diner, a 1950s-themed restaurant, and they see waiters dressed up as celebrities from the 1950s, including James Dean, Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley. Peter hears his favourite song The Trashmen's \\"Surfin' Bird\\" on the jukebox. He obtains a record of it from the restaurant upon a restaurant worker's realisation that the song actually came out in the 1960s, and is therefore inappropriate for a 1950s diner. Peter repeats the song over and over on the way home in bed and even when waking up Lois in order to annoy his family. He asks Brian for the news paper and reads it and says that he thought that it will be big news. Afterward, he sings the song again and falls to the ground. However, the final straw of the family's hatred of Surfin' Bird is when Peter foolishly spends over six thousand dollars of the family fortune to buy himself a two-minute clip on TV saying that \\"I dream of an America where everybody knows that the bird is the word\\" and singing the song again. Stewie and Brian steal the record while Peter is asleep one night and destroy it. In a fit of rage, Peter accuses the others, saying they had a motive as he changed his will and left everything to the record. Oblivious to the fact that Lois, Chris and Meg have evidence to prove they did not take it he accuses them of conspiring to destroy his record, and suspects his kids for possible motives. He then furiously goes to the town's only record shop the next morning to buy another copy, but it turns out the stores had already been visited by \\"a dog\\" and \\"a baby\\" (Brian and Stewie) who bought all the copies. Peter is frustrated, but gets distracted as he recognizes the record sales clerk to be Jesus Christ. Christ reveals he goes to Earth every 100 years or so to check on the world, and since his father had become highly irritable after giving up smoking, he needed some time away. He and Peter become friends, and Peter invites him to dinner, along with Brian. Brian asks for proof that Jesus is who he claims to be, so he turns everyone's dinner into sundaes and, on Peter's request, makes Lois' breasts enlarge to massive proportions. Peter convinces him to make his second coming public. Christ walks on water to retrieve a dollar bill that blew out of Peter's hand. Consequently, he becomes famous and makes celebrity appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and the MTV Movie Awards, and his growing popularity leads him to neglect his friendship with Peter. The next day, Peter watches the news, where Tom Tucker reports that Jesus was found in Mary-Kate Olsen's apartment that morning face down and unconscious. Tucker reports that police have revived and arrested the disoriented Jesus, who quoted \\"Jews are responsible for all the world's wars\\". Jesus is arrested for his illegal prank and sent to jail. Jesus asks Peter to bail him out, but now in disrepute, Jesus decides that maybe he was not mature enough to return to the world yet and bids farewell to the family. Before he leaves, Jesus gives Peter a gift, another record of \\"Surfin' Bird\\", and Peter once again annoys his family with the song. \\"Surfin' Bird\\" then plays as the credits roll. ==Production== Co- executive producer, Steve Callaghan, made a minor appearance. The episode was written by one of this season's co-executive producers Brian Scully, on his first writing job for the show. It was directed by Mike Kim, who had been with the show since its fifth season when he directed the episode \\"Stewie Loves Lois\\". Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum served as supervising directors for the episode. The episode's music was composed by Walter Murphy. Actors Chris Cox, Ike Barinholtz, Amanda MacDonald, Niecy Nash, Paris Hilton and Perez Hilton guest starred. Recurring voice actors for the show, including Patrick Warburton, Adam West, Johnny Brennan, writer Alec Sulkin, writer John Viener, writer Kirker Butler, co-executive producer Steve Callaghan, co- executive producer Mark Hentemann and executive producer Danny Smith also made minor appearances. \\"I Dream of Jesus\\", along with the first eight episodes of the seventh season were released on DVD by 20th Century Fox in the United States and Canada on June 16, 2009, one month after it had completed broadcast on television. The \\"Volume 7\\" DVD release features bonus material including deleted scenes, animatics, and commentaries for every episode. ==Cultural references== The episode's name is a play of the title of the NBC sitcom, I Dream of Jeannie. The scene in which Stewie and Brian destroy the record is nearly identical to a scene in the movie Office Space in which the characters destroy a printer, including use of the same song (Geto Boys' Still). Peter makes Jesus admit that he is the messiah by threatening to urinate over albums of Christian artist Amy Grant. Peter attempts to top Jesus' story about his crucifixion during a dinner conversation with a story about how he and his friends \\"got wrecked on Southern Comfort\\" before going to see The Chronicles of Riddick. George W. Bush explains to the American people that going to war was correct because he answers to Jesus Christ, then Peter and Jesus interrupt him to disagree with him, similar to a scene in Woody Allen's Annie Hall. Jesus is invited to the Tonight Show, hosted by Jay Leno. Jesus assists the MTV Movie Awards, which is being hosted by Dane Cook, to present an award alongside The Pussycat Dolls. Jesus is found in Mary-Kate Olsen's apartment. While at the MTV Movie Awards, Jesus says \\"I used to hang around with only one whore\\". When Jesus is arrested, he rants saying that \\"Jews are responsible for all the world's wars\\", a reference to a similar outburst during Mel Gibson's DUI arrest. Lindsay Lohan is lampooned in the episode. In the record store Peter meets Jesus, some of the posters featured on the wall include the cover artwork for Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, Nirvana's In Utero and R.E.M.'s Automatic for the People. ==Reception== According to Nielsen ratings, \\"I Dream of Jesus\\" was the most-watched program on Fox the night it originally aired. It was watched by 8.4 million viewers, and earned a 4.3/10 ratings share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Richard Keller of TV Squad praised the \\"Surfing Bird\\" and Office Space parody segments. Ahsan Haque of IGN rated the episode a 7/10, claiming the episode had entertaining moments, but was not one of the show's strongest efforts. Haque wrote, \\"Jesus on Family Guy should have been a big deal and featured far more laughs than it did.\\" Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club praised the \\"Surfin Bird\\" plot, but stated that the Jesus story was abrupt, adding, \\"There was a lot of ground Family Guy didn't tread that they wanted to\\". L. Brent Bozell III of the Parents Television Council, a common critic of the show, took offense at this episode's portrayal of Jesus. Bozell said \\"this lying, slacker Jesus is even dumber than Peter, the greatest idiot on animated television today.\\" Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number nine on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of \\"yukyukyuks\\" due its use of the 'Sufin Bird' song and quipped that \\"you never know when it might strike again.\\" Seth MacFarlane was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice- Over Performance for his role as Peter Griffin in this episode, MacFarlane was also nominated for the Annie Award for Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production or Short Form for his work in I Dream of Jesus, but lost to Ahmed Best for his role as Jar Jar Binks in Robot Chicken: Star Wars Episode II. According to Seth MacFarlane, \\"I Dream of Jesus\\" was one of three episodes (along with \\"Road to Germany\\" and \\"Family Gay\\") submitted for consideration for \\"Outstanding Comedy Series\\" in the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards in 2009. He explained, \\"We picked three of our edgier shows as a choice. We figured if we are going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are.\\" The series was ultimately nominated for the award, the first time an animated series was nominated for the same category since the ABC sitcom The Flintstones in 1961. ==ReferencesCategory:Family Guy (season 7) episodes Category:2008 American television episodes Category:Portrayals of Jesus on television ","title":"I Dream of Jesus"},{"id":"19301897","text":"McAuley High School can refer to: *McAuley High School (Cincinnati, Ohio), USA *McAuley High School (Toledo, Ohio), USA *McAuley High School (New Zealand) ","title":"McAuley High School"},{"id":"19301913","text":"Flamingo Entertainment Centre is the biggest entertainment centre in the Nordic countries.

Since 1995, his work has appeared in publications including ELLE, Lib√©ration, Le Monde, Geo France, Marie-Claire, National Geographic France, Paris Match and VSD, and was awarded a \\"special mention\\" award in the 2005 Prix Nadar competition, along with other co-authors, for his work 'Photojournalism at the crossroads'. Based on a philosophy of bearing witness and of inquiry, his photographic work concentrates on conflict zones and areas of breaking news, in (West Africa, Europe, and the Middle East). He is simultaneously pursuing a project of documenting immigration in France. In 2005, he developed and directed a multidisciplinary project \\"Territories of fiction\\". In 2006 he co-founded the Hans Lucas audiovisual studio. In 2008, he became co-director of the photo agency MYOP, and also participated in the creation of Photojournalism.fr, dedicated to news photography and photojournalism. ==MYOP== Since June 2008, Wilfrid Est√®ve has shared the management of MYOP with Guillaume Binet and Lionel Charrier. The photo agency was created in 2005 and consists of 12 independent photographers. Its originality lies in its ability to show diverse points of view. The members of the agency come from various backgrounds, including conceptual photography, photojournalism and documentary. Anchored in the political photography of the newspaper Lib√©ration, where most of the members of the agency do freelance work, the photographers of MYOP have done assignments for the most famous French and international newspapers such as Le Monde and magazines such as Elle, G√©o, Marie Claire, National Geographic, Newsweek, Paris Match and The Times. MYOP photographers have received awards for their work, including the W. Eugene Smith grant (Alain Keler in 1997), the Agena best humanitarian reportage prize (Alexis Cordesse in 1992), the Bourse 3P de Yann Arthus Bertrand (Alain Keler in 2004), two Bourses FIACR (Oan Kim in 2008), the Prix Nadar (Wilfrid Est√®ve in 2005), the Paris Match prize (Alain Keler in 1986), World Press Photo (Alain Keler in the nature section, 1986), World Press Photo Joop Swart Masterclass (Alexis Cordesse in 1993), third prize Observer Hodge Award (Alexis Cordesse in 1995), Prix des Voies Off des rencontres photographiques d'Arles (Wilfrid Est√®ve in 2000). M.Y.O.P stands for \\"Mind Your Own Photography\\" (although it has also been said to mean \\"Mes Yeux Objets Patients\\" (\\"my eyes are patient objects\\"), a reference to Paul Eluard. Esteve left M.Y.O.P. in 2010 after a disagreement on the organization's goals and development with the other members. ==Freelens-France== Since 2004, Wilfrid Est√®ve has led Freelens-France, formerly known as The National Association of FreeLens Journalist Reporters, Photographers and Filmmakers. Freelens-France's objective is to assert the role and importance of photography in democratic debate. Founded in 1962, in the last five decades it has brought together some of the major figures of photojournalism, such as Henri Cartier-Bresson, Raymond Depardon, Gis√®le Freund, Marc Riboud, Sebasti√£o Salgado. In earlier years, the organization was led by Robert Doisneau, Roger Pic, Patrick Bard and Lorenzo Virgili. In July 2008, FreeLens-France launched the website Photojournalisme.fr, dedicated to news photography and photojournalists. ==Teaching== Since 1996, Wilfrid Est√®ve has taught photojournalism at several well-known schools (l'√âcole sup√©rieure de journalisme de Lille), and specialized training centers (CFPJ or l'√âcole des M√©tiers de l'Information, in Paris) as well as conducting workshops at festivals. In 2006, he became the educational director of the photographic division of l'√âcole des M√©tiers de l'Information. In 2007, he put together the Prix Tremplin Photo, a scholarship awarded during the festival \\"Visa pour l'image\\" and dedicated to photojournalism. A qualifying course in photojournalism, which Esteve co- manages with Mat Jacob of the collective Tendance floue and Lorenzo Virgili, counts among its former students the 2008 recipient of the prix Mark Grosset (Elisabeth Schneider), the 2007 recipient of the award Visa d'or Magazin au Festival International du Photojournalism Visa pour l'image and the Festival du scoop et du journalism d'Angers' Prix Special du Jury (Lizzie Sadin), the recipients in 2002 and 2004 of the Prix Kodak de la critique (Julien Daniel and J√©r√¥mine Derigny), the 2005 recipient of the grand Prix Calderon (J√©r√¥me Sessini) of the festival du Scoop et du journalisme d'Angers, two recipients of the 3P scholarship (Lizzie Sadin and Frederique Jouval), the 2003 recipient of the grand Prix International du Reportage Humanitaire CARE (Florence Gaty), the recipient of the Prix Fnac Attention Talents 2002 and the Prix Fuji 2002 (Julien Daniel) and two recipients of the World Press Photo (Julien Daniel). ==Territories of fiction== In 2005, Wilfrid Est√®ve launched the multimedia project \\"Territories of fiction,\\" with Virginie Terrasse and Benjamin Boccas acting as artistic editors. The resulting exhibition, which included photography and video, examined France through the work of one hundred artists, 13 sound designers, 2 graphic designers, 28 filmmakers and 57 photographers. The project developed a concept called POM, Petite Oeuvre Multim√©dia (Small Works of Multimedia). \\"Territories of fiction\\" toured France, Belgium, Italy and Poland, and has had approximately one million visitors since 2006. The project made its 2006 debut at the Galerie du Ch√¢teau d'eau, as well as on the walls of the Toulouse subway (usually dedicated to advertisements). Marta Eloy Cichocka, journalist and university professor, writes of \\"Territories of fiction\\": \\"[In] this bridge between information and art...the artists confront social frustration, the lack of confidence in politics and democracy, the revival of radical political parties, as well as problems linked to immigration and integration\\".Marta Eloy Cichocka, ¬´ Fin de saison : Transfotografia w Tr√≥jmiescie ¬ª, POZYTYW, 08-09/2006 ==Oeil Public== In 1995, Esteve was a co-founder of the photo agency Oeil Public ('The Public Eye') which he left in 2004. The agency closed its doors in 2009. The agency won many prestigious photography awards (including the World Press Photo and Prix Kodak de la critique) and contributed to renowned international publications. According to Michel Guerrin, \\"Oeil Public takes its rightful place as a descendant of the Magnum agency...for its independence and aesthetic, but also of the Viva agency, a superb team of rabble-rousers created in the aftermath of May 68...\\"Michel Guerrin, \\"L'Oeil Public tourne son regard social vers le festival Visa pour l'image\\", Le Monde, 02/09/2001 ==Quotes== \\"For the past ten years the photographic world has been destabilized. New technologies have redefined the performance of our profession. Major changes have taken places in the fields of production, distribution and consumption. A new electronic economy has emerged. It upsets our ways of thinking, of working, of seeing the world, without having given us time to prepare for it. Now that photography has become a consumer good, it is necessary to act. Are we to encourage the bulimic consumption of information in an atmosphere of urgency? Should we be satisfied with feeding those illusion making machines, the stock agencies, and thus submerge and intoxicate the public with photographs? Doesn't the current approach to news lead us to a condition of \\"junk media\\"? In this market of over-consumption, it is necessary to take a step back, to analyze, and not to lose the thread of our history. Try not to focus on the events while forgetting the profound conditions that created them. Try to understand the way in which the public builds its vision of the world. Fight against the rise of ignorance, of intolerance and the fear of the other. Fear kills the spirit. The curiosity that comes with taking a picture is a necessary bridge to other cultures. Let us prevent the reader from being swallowed by the sensational and the author from turning into a voyeur. The media imposes its reality on us, and those responsible are assuring us an 'information spectacle'. Contemporary photography is at a crossroads. Preceding generations were focused around a journalistic approach based on eyewitness reports. Where does it stand today? It is unusual in France that a young photographer claims to be a photojournalist, that he develops a point of view, a relevant angle. However, trying to erase any trace of a political viewpoint from reporting contradicts its very meaning. It disinherits the dream and the revolt. By entering into history, photography loses its desire to reshape the world. We do not have the desire to mold a culture of consensus. Today, we no longer know how to show, we don't even know how to see. The threat lies in the fact that financial results take the place of testimony and emotion. And that the mandate of a subculture replaces a unified world vision. Let's not forget that to exclude, also means to be deprived of the vision of the other, and that the way through which we inform and get information, is a major aspect of democracy.\\" Wilfrid Est√®ve during the conference \\"Is photojournalism a political action?\\" organized in 2005 by Visa pour l'image. \\"Actes du colloque Visa pour l'Image du 1er et 2 septembre 2005\\" ed.

The libretto, by Claudio Guastalla, is based on a Medieval life of Saint Mary of Egypt, contained in the translation into the vernacular of the Vitae Patrum written by Domenico Cavalca. The work was originally intended as a concert piece although it has been fully staged in some revivals. It was first performed at Carnegie Hall, New York City on 16 March 1932. The first stage performance was at the Teatro Goldoni in Venice on 10 August 1932. Both the language of the libretto and the music employ archaism; Respighi's score contains stylistic echoes of Gregorian chant, Renaissance music and Monteverdi. ==Roles== {  !Role !Voice type !Premiere cast - Maria soprano Charlotte B√∂rner - Abbate Zosimo (Abbot Zosima)/Pilgrim baritone Nelson Eddy - Sailor tenor Alfredo Tedeschi - The leper tenor  - Second companion/Poor man contralto Myrtle Leonard - First companion/Blind woman/Voice of an angel soprano Helen Gleason - } ==Instrumentation== Maria egiziaca is scored for the following instruments: flute , oboe, 2 clarinets, bassoon, 2 horns, trumpet, 2 trombones, harpsichord (or piano), strings. ==Synopsis== The prostitute Mary suddenly feels an overwhelming longing to travel to Jerusalem.

Galenskaparna firar 30 √•r med show Dagens Nyheter 5 December 2011, retrieved 11 April 2013 Since the early 1980s, Galenskaparna och After Shave have produced nearly 28 revues, restaurant shows, and tours, as well as 8 movies, 5 television series and 30 studio albums. Galenskaparna och After Shave has made some of the biggest movie, TV, song and revue successes in Swedish history, including TV series Macken (The Petrol Station), the movie Hajen som visste f√∂r mycket (The Shark that Knew Too Much) and the revue Stinsen brinner (The Station Master is on Fire). ==Members== Galenskaparna is a comedy troupe which was formed in 1978. Members of the group are Anders Eriksson, his older brother Claes Eriksson and Kerstin Granlund. Granlund and Claes Eriksson had previously appeared together in a popular student comedy group called Utan Lots, 1972‚Äì77, at university. After Shave formed in 1979 as a barbershop quartet at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg. Its members are Jan Rippe (bass), Knut Agnred (solo/tenor) and Per Fritzell (tenor). Peter Rangmar (baritone) was the fourth member, but he died in 1997 of melanoma. Most of the original members of the two groups are still members of Galenskaparna & After Shave; the exceptions are Rangmar, who was a member until his death, and Granlund, who left the group in the early 2000s. The motor and key person of the group is often said to be Claes Eriksson, as he generally is the writer and director of the group's various productions, and also the person writing the songs for the productions. The group is influenced a lot by the humour of both Monty Python and Hasse√•tage, as well as Povel Ramel (in terms of his musical humour and playfulness with texts and lyrics), and also the physical comedy of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Claes Eriksson is also a sharp political critic, and uses humour to comment on Swedish society and politics. ==ProductionsRevues, musical theatre=== *1982 Skruven √§r l√∂s (\\"The Screw is Loose\\") *1983 Tr√§smak (\\"Taste of Wood\\") *1985 Cyklar (\\"Bikes\\") *1987 Stinsen brinner (\\"The Station Master is on Fire\\") *1991 Grisen i s√§cken (\\"The Pig in the Bag\\") *1992 Skruven √§r l√∂s *1994 Lyckad nedfrysning av herr Moro (\\"Successful Freezing of Mr. Moro\\") *1996 Kanske R√∂dluvan (\\"Maybe Little Red Riding Hood\\") *1997 Alla ska bada (\\"Everyone Will Bathe\\") *2000 Allt M√∂jligt (\\"Everything Possible\\") *2000 Jul Jul Jul (\\"Christmas Christmas Christmas\\") *2002 Kasinofeber (\\"Casino Fever\\") ===Innshows and shows=== *1987 Kabar√© Kumlin *1996 Kajskjul 8 *1996 √Öke fr√•n √Östol *1999 En himla helkul kv√§ll *2004 Falkes Fondue *2007 Familjen Falke *2007 Cabaret Cartwright ===Tours=== *1987 Norrlandsturn√© - a tour in Norrland. *1987 Slottsturn√© - a tour in different ch√¢teau ruins in Sweden. *1993 N√•'t nytt?

Its Chateauesque aspects, such as the stonework, irregular silhouette, conical-roofed towers, wall dormers and ornamental cresting with finials. The main entrance's rounded arch with support from thick, foliated columns is a distinct Romanesque touch, however. In recent years its age has made it a difficult building to keep warm in the wintertime. Even with the windows closed, City Hall has been drafty.

The base is located among hills close to the northern border with China. The spaceport was built on the site of the village Pongdong-ri which was displaced during construction. It was the site for the 13 April 2012 launch of the North Korean satellite Kwangmy≈èngs≈èng-3, which was launched to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il-Sung. The rocket launch failed, but on 12 December of the same year Kwangmy≈èngs≈èng-3 Unit 2 was successfully launched and brought into Earth orbit. The launches were controversial as they were dismissed by the US as tests of ballistic missile technology and hence of breach of an agreement made between North Korea and the US in February 2012. During the 2018 North Korea‚ÄìUnited States summit, Kim Jong-un promised that North Korea would destroy a missile engine test stand soon. The site was not initially named but was later identified to be the Sohae Satellite Launching Ground by US officials. This pledge was made official as part of the Pyongyang Declaration which Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-In signed at the September 2018 inter-Korean summit. On 31 October 2018, South Korean officials visited the site and confirmed it was being dismantled and ready for an upcoming inspection. But in early 2019, after a summit between North Korea and the U.S. ended without an agreement, North Korea began rebuilding of the site. A test took place in December 2019, which confirmed that the site was once again operational. ==History== Signs of construction were visible during the early 1990s and became more pronounced by the early 2000s. A major progress in the construction was discovered in 2008 by Jane's Information Group, which requested imagery from the satellite company DigitalGlobe. Movements from the Sanum‚Äôdong missile research factory with the erector transporter and railroad, road transportation to the space center of a prototype Unha-3 class booster first two stages initially took place over 29‚Äì31 May 2009 possibly for logistics testing as well as personnel facilities infrastructure testing training purposes. The results of those tests suggest that military and design specialists ultimately decided to build a facilities access railroad to cut down the 15 kilometer road access logistics issues to the space center. By early 2011 it was reported that the construction was completed and that it had been under construction for a decade. The first official mention of the site took place in March 2012 when North Korea announced it will launch from that site the satellite Kwangmy≈èngs≈èng-3. On April 2012, prior to the launch of the satellite, Jang Myong-jin, director of the Sohae, introduced the launching process of the Unha-3 rocket (Korean: ÏùÄÌïò-3Ìò∏, ÈäÄÊ≤≥-3) during a guided media tour. The first launch of Kwangmyongsong-3 on 12 April 2012 failed. On 1 December 2012, the Korean Central News Agency announced that a second version of Kwangmyongsong-3 was to be launched from Sohae between 10‚Äì22 December 2012. North Korea declared the launch successful, and the South Korean military and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) reported that initial indications suggested that an object had achieved orbit. North Korea had previously claimed the Kwangmy≈èngs≈èng-1 and Kwangmy≈èngs≈èng-2 launches successful, despite American military sources confirming that they failed to achieve orbit. On 7 February 2016, North Korea successfully launched a long- range rocket, carrying the satellite Kwangmyongsong-4, from the station. Critics suggest that the real purpose of the launch was test a ballistic missile. The launch was strongly condemned by the UN Security Council. A statement broadcast on Korean Central Television said that a new Earth observation satellite, Kwangmyongsong-4, had successfully been put into orbit less than 10 minutes after lift-off from the Sohae space centre in North Phyongan province. North Korea's National Aerospace Development Administration stated the launch was \\"an epochal event in developing the country's science, technology, economy and defence capability by legitimately exercising the right to use space for independent and peaceful purposes\\". The launch prompted South Korea and the United States to discuss the possibility of placing an advanced missile defence system in South Korea, a move strongly opposed by both China and Russia. ==Facilities== The entire facility occupies over six square kilometers, and consists of a launch site, a static rocket motor test stand, vehicle checkout and processing buildings, a launch control building, a large support area, a complex headquarters building and an entry control point. The site is five times larger than Tonghae Launch Site. There is much speculation about the functions of different parts of the site but the nuances of satellite photography based guesswork may not be communicated effectively in the mass media. Western sources identified a building as a \\"high bay processing facility\\" which turned out to be the launch control centre when the site was visited by journalists. The building previously identified as the control centre was actually an observation point. ==Dismantlement and International Inspection== In July 2018, North Korea began dismantling the Sohae Satellite Launching Station.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/07/23/north- korea-begins-dismantling-key-test-site-satellite-imagery-suggests/ Satellite images taken between 20 and 22 July showed the destruction of a rocket engine test stand used to develop liquid-fuel engines for ballistic missiles, space- launch vehicles and a rail-mounted processing building where space launch vehicles were assembled before being moved to the launch pad Commercial satellite imagery from 3 August 2018 confirmed that additional dismantlement activities were taking place at Sohae as well, including the destruction of facility's vertical engine test stand and fuel/oxidizer bunkers. In September 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jung-Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-In signed the \\"Pyongyang Joint Declaration of September 2018\\", which, among other things, pledged for North Korea to complete its dismantlement of Sohae and allow foreign experts to observe the dismantling of the missile engine testing site and a launch pad. By 10 October 2018, commercial satellite imagery confirmed that the site's legacy fuel/oxidizer bunker located at the launch pad had been largely removed. Officials from South Korea's National Intelligence Service who visited the site on 31 October 2018 stated that Sohae was in fact being dismantled and was ready for an upcoming international inspection. ==Reconstruction== After the U.S.-North Korea summit in February 2019 ended without an agreement, new open-source satellite images showed that the site was undergoing reconstruction and appeared operational. On 7 December 2019, a satellite image obtained by CNN showed activity and the presence of a large shipping container at the facility's engine test stand, which observers said could indicate plans to resume testing engines which are used to power satellite launchers and intercontinental ballistic missiles.New satellite image shows activity at previously dismantled North Korean test site The next day, North Korea announced that it had carried out a \\"very important test\\" at the site, and said it would play a \\"significant role\\" in changing the country's strategic position in the near future.N.

The concerts began with trial broadcasts in the New York area during 1925 and 1926. Graham McNamee was the announcer and the Goldman Band conducted by founder Edwin Franko Goldman performed when the hour-long program began February 18, 1927, on NBC; it changed to a symphonic sound with Rosario Bourdon conducting a 30-piece NBC house orchestra that summer along with the Cavaliers Quartet. On January 3, 1930, Jessica Dragonette brought her repertoire of 500 songs to the series, often doing duets with Frank Parker and generating top ratings during the 1930s. She was replaced by soprano Lucille Manners in 1937. Other performers during this period were Robert Simmons and James Melton. Along with the Cities Service Singers, baritone Ross Graham (1905-1986) arrived in 1939. Graham was also heard on Show Boat. Maestro Dr. Frank Black headed the show from at least 1938Advertisement on 1938 Cities Service Road map to 1942 along with Manners and Graham. The title changed to Highways in Melody in 1944 when Paul Lavalle was the orchestra leader.

It was originally known as the London Prison Farm. The original construction was the use of human waste to make bricks. From 1913 to 1925 it was a branch of the Ohio Penitentiary in Columbus. In 1925, it became a separate facility. The prison currently accommodates approximately: 2,500 adult males in three security levels: minimum, medium and close-security. == Construction and Ohio State inmates == When the London Prison Farm was first proposed, there were two possible locations, Plain City and London. The decision was made to build the prison in London and the land, most of which was swamp, was purchased from John Ellsworth. In 1910, honor inmates were transported from the Ohio Penitentiary to London by railway to construct the prison. === Facilities for the inmates === Originally, prisoners were housed in dormitories, each of which held around 300 men. There were isolation cells in case an inmate had to be punished. By March 1928, the prison housed 507 inmates. All the inmates were examined at the Ohio Penitentiary and if the men didn't have any diseases, they were shipped to the Farm. The London Prison Farm had different types of vocational training, but no educational program for the inmates. Today, London is one of the least costly institutions in Ohio's DR&C; to operate. == Present day == The London Correctional Institution now owns around . Over $30 million have been spent to renovate the prison. As of November 2013, the population was 2,283 inmates. The prison has a staff of 379 employees. === Programs for the inmates === The London Correctional Institution provides programs for the inmates, such as the Family Life Centers and The New Beginnings Unit. Now, the facility has a reading room for inmates and their children. Inmates are also able to earn their GEDs and other academic diplomas. Vocational programs include auto technology, barbering, dental lab, HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning), web based design, animal training, and culinary arts. == References == Category:Prisons in Ohio Category:Buildings and structures in Madison County, Ohio Category:London, Ohio Category:1924 establishments in Ohio ","title":"London Correctional Institution"},{"id":"19302495","text":"Lindiwe Benedicta Hendricks (born 29 July 1957 in Vryburg, Northern Cape) is a South African politician and a member of the National Assembly.

The group was such a hit that they started a weekly residency at the club. Their public prominence increased due to their extended residency at Nublu, where they came into contact with prominent New York influence David Byrne, who helped propel further recognition for the band when they collaborated on Forro in the Dark's 2006 album Bonfires of S√£o Jo√£o.http://journal.davidbyrne.com/2006/11/11906_forr_in_n.html In November 2006, Forro in the Dark released their debut album Bonfires of S√£o Jo√£o, which includes guest performances from Bebel Gilberto, David Byrne and Miho Hatori. In regards to the album, Allmusic noted that \\"Forro in the Dark hang on tightly to the danceability of the music but are keen to expand the music's sonic parameters. A reggae tune, 'Limoeiro do Norte,' spotlights a wobbly flute up front, while 'Que Que Tu Fez' crosses an insistent Afro-Caribbean rhythm with flamenco handclaps, a flighty flute, and a spry vocal. Guest stars liven up the proceedings: David Byrne vocalizes exuberantly on two tracks, including 'Asa Branca,' a forro standard, and the Brazilian diva Bebel Gilberto donates a rich, sultry lead vocal to the airy ballad 'Wandering Swallow.' Miho Hatori of the band Cibo Matto further blurs the lines by bringing a Japanese pop taste to Gonzaga's 'Paraiba'‚Ä¶\\" The group toured throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe in 2007 to promote the album. During this time they recorded the song \\"City of Immigrants\\" that was featured on \\"Steve Earle‚Äôs Grammy-winning album Washington Square Serenade\\". ===Light a Candle=== Following the 2008 release of their EP Dia de Roda, Forro in the Dark began work on their second full-length album Light a Candle. Guest artists on the LP include Sabina Sciubba of Brazilian Girls who appears on the track \\"Silence Is Golden\\" and singer-songwriter Jesse Harris who provides vocals for the song \\"Just Like Any Other Night\\". The album also features covers of forr√≥ classics like \\"Saudades de Manezinho Araujo\\" by Teo Azevedo and \\"Forro de Dois Amigos\\" by Edmilson do P√≠fano.

Refosco was also announced as the percussionist for Thom Yorke's new live band Atoms for Peace (which also includes Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Joey Waronker of Beck and Nigel Godrich). Refosco joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers touring lineup as a percussionist in 2011 and has been with them ever since. ==Musical style== As described by Refosco, forr√≥ \\"is a happy, danceable music based on four elements: simple melodies, basic harmonies, driving rhythms and funny lyrics. Those elements are traditionally performed by three instruments: a triangle, an accordion, and a zabumba, a drum pitched somewhere between a low snare and a small bass\\". The band alternates between these musical components as they include various guitars and other percussion instruments, such as a Bahian drum called the timbau, along with traditional forr√≥ components.

Venture Valuation - First Chicago Method. Venionaire Capital. The First Chicago Method was first developed by, and consequently named for, the venture capital arm of the First Chicago bank, the predecessor of private equity firms Madison Dearborn Partners and GTCR. How to value your deal like an investor. Global Entrepreneurship Institute. December 2007. It was first discussed academically in 1987. William A. Sahlman and Daniel R Scherlis (1987). A Method For Valuing High-Risk, Long-Term Investments: The \\"Venture Capital Method\\". Harvard Business School (Case Collection, 288-006) ==Method== The First Chicago Method takes account of payouts to the holder of specific investments in a company through the holding period under various scenarios; see Quantifying uncertainty under Corporate finance. Most often this methodology will involve the construction of: * An \\"upside case\\" or \\"best-case scenario\\" (often, the business plan submitted) * A \\"base case\\" * A \\"downside\\" or \\"worst-case scenario.\\" Once these have been constructed, the valuation proceeds as follows.See, for example, Schumann (2006). #First, for each of the three cases, a scenario specific, internally consistent forecast of cashflows - see discussion under Financial modeling - is constructed for the years leading up to the assumed divestment by the private equity investor. #Next, a divestment price - i.e. a Terminal value - is modelled by assuming an exit multiple consistent with the scenario in question. (Of course, the divestment may take various forms - see Private equity #Investments in private equity.) #The cash flows and exit price are then discounted using the investor‚Äôs required return, and the sum of these is the value of the business under the scenario in question. #Finally, each of the three scenario-values are multiplied through by a probability corresponding to each scenario (as estimated by the investor). The value of the investment is then the probability weighted sum of the three scenarios. ==Use== The method is used particularly in the valuation of growth companies which often do not have historical financial results that can be used for meaningful comparable company analysis. Multiplying actual financial results against a comparable valuation multiple often yields a value for the company that is objectively too low given the prospects for the business. Often the First Chicago Method may be preferable to a Discounted Cash Flow taken alone. This is because such income-based business value assessment may lack the support generally observable in the market place. Indeed, professionally performed business appraisals go further and use a set of methods under all three approaches to business valuation.Business valuation using the Market, Income and Asset Approaches. ValuAdder Variations of the First Chicago Method are employed in a number of markets, including the private equity secondary market where investors project outcomes for portfolios of private equity investments under various scenarios. ==See also== *rNPV: cash flows, as opposed to scenarios, are probability-weighted. *Valuation using discounted cash flows #Determine equity value ==NotesReferences== *Ann-Kristin Achleitner and Eva Lutz.

The song was written by Selena y Los Dinos band member Pete Astudillo and her brother, A.B. Quintanilla III, and produced by Quintanilla, and is a Spanish- language adaptation of \\"Is It the Beat?\\", an English song originally written by Quintanilla and Pamela Phillips Oland. \\"Enamorada de Ti\\" is a freestyle song, a musical genre popular during the late 1980s. The recording was remixed by Juan Magan for the eponymous album in 2012, a project headed by Humberto Gatica. Although the song was moderately successful during the early 1990s, it was exposed to a wider audience in the remix album Enamorada de Ti. Because of this, the song peaked at number 17 on the US Billboard Regional Mexican Digital Songs chart that year. In 1997, the posthumously-released remix version of \\"Is It the Beat?\\" adopted the rap verse found in \\"Enamorada de Ti\\". In the lyrics the protagonist sings to her love interest about his departure, which has saddened her; without him she cannot function normally, because she is in love with him. Selena performed the song during her Ven Conmigo Tour (1990‚Äì92) and at the 1990 Tejano Music Awards, where she received the Female Vocalist of the Year award. During the first season of Telemundo's La Voz Kids, a Spanish-language version of the US singing competition The Voice, Xairexis Garcia performed \\"Enamorada de Ti\\". == Background and development == In 1989, Selena was signed to EMI Latin and released her self-titled debut album that year. Around that time her brother, A.B. Quintanilla III, began producing and writing most of her songs. Selena had earlier recorded three demo songs for a potential English crossover album, one of these songs being \\"Is It the Beat?\\", written by Quintanilla III and Pamela Phillips Oland, but was told that she was not ready for an English debut. According to Quintanilla III in the 20 Years of Music series, his father (and band manager) Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. originated the idea of recording a \\"hip-hop\\"-type song for Selena's second studio album, Ven Conmigo. He said that Quintanilla Jr was told by Jose Behar, president of EMI Latin, that several pop-music executive producers were going to attend an upcoming performance by Selena and her band. The idea was that Quintanilla III could write a song which could attract a crossover deal from EMI Records. Upon listening to the original recording of \\"Is It the Beat?\\", the decision was made to write and record a Spanish- language adaptation of the song, called \\"Enamorada de Ti\\", for Ven Conmigo. During the interview, Quintanilla III said that the writing for \\"Enamorada de Ti\\" began in an Albuquerque, New Mexico Motel 6 with fellow band members Pete Astudillo and keyboardist Ricky Vela. In the same interview Selena's sister (and drummer) Suzette Quintanilla called the recording a \\"Top 40 song\\" and \\"fun, that was definitely one of the fun songs on the album\\", with the recording \\"bringing out Selena's soul side\\". The recording is a freestyle dance-pop songRichmond, p. 20\\"Wheeler, p. 40 in common time at a tempo of 112 beats per minute. In the lyrics, the singer is saddened and bewildered by the departure of her love interest. She tells him how much she is in love with him, and cannot live without him. The remix version featured on Enamorada de Ti (2012) is a merengue duet with Spanish singer Juan Magan. At the 1990 Tejano Music Awards Selena performed \\"Enamorada de Ti\\" with three backup dancers, emulating dance moves popularized by Michael and Janet Jackson. She won the Tejano Music Award for Female Vocalist of The Year. During the first season of Telemundo's La Voz Kids, a Spanish-language version of the US singing competition show The Voice, Xairexis Garcia performed \\"Enamorada de Ti\\". == Critical reception and legacy == Federico Martinez of La Prensa called \\"Enamorada de Ti\\" a \\"popular title track\\". In his review of the remix album Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that all its songs were \\"rooted in the '90s and sound that way\\", and altering the recordings to \\"update it\\" was unfeasible. Carlos Quintana, a Latin-music writer for About.com, called \\"Enamorada de Ti\\" one of the best tracks on the remix album. Enrique Lopetegui of the San Antonio Current called it a \\"crowd-pleasing\\" song with an \\"unbearable\\" merengue. Nilan Lovelace of Reporter Magazine Archives noted that although the original recording of \\"Enamorada de Ti\\" was a \\"slow tempo love song\\", the remix version had a \\"lively, tropical tone\\". \\"Enamorada de Ti\\" has been featured on several compilation albums since its debut on Ven Conmigo in 1990. A club-mix version of the song was featured on All My Hits/Todos Mis Exitos Vol. 2 (2000), and the original version was added to La Leyenda (2010). In 1997, \\"Is It the Beat?\\" was released posthumously on the soundtrack for Selena's biographical film and as a single; the soundtrack version included a rap verse taken directly from \\"Enamorada de Ti\\". The single also included two versions of \\"Enamorada de Ti\\": a Spanish radio edit and a Spanish club mix, as well as a Spanglish version which combined verses from both songs. In 2012, Humberto Gatica headed the production of Enamorada de Ti with the goal of rejuvenating several of Selena's songs in popular genres. Spanish singer Juan Magan remixed and sang a small part in \\"Enamorada de Ti\\" for the album. The recording peaked at number 17 on the US Billboard Regional Mexican Digital Songs chart that same year. == Chart performance == { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" !scope=\\"col\\"Chart (2012) !scope=\\"col\\"Peak position - !scope=\\"row\\"U.S. Billboard Regional Mexican Digital Songs  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"17 } == Personnel == Credits from the album's liner notes: *Selena ‚Äì vocals *Ricky Vela ‚Äì keyboards *Suzette Quintanilla ‚Äì drums *A.B.

Cuban music from A to Z. Revised by Sue Steward. A biographical dictionary of Cuban music, artists, composers, groups and terms. Duke University, Durham NC; Tumi, Bath. Alberto Villal√≥n He was the only one of the 'four greats' of the trova to come from a well-to-do family. Villal√≥n and his sister Am√©rica studied guitar with Pepe S√°nchez, the father of the trova movement. Later, he studied classical guitar to achieve a really excellent technique.Canizares, Dulcila 1995. La trova tradicional. 2nd ed, La Habana. He composed his first canciones and boleros at fourteen, and moved to Havana in 1900. In 1907 he recorded on Edison cylinders. In 1908 he formed the Cuarteto Villal√≥n with Adolfo Colombo (tenor), Claudio Garc√≠a (baritone), Emilio Reinoso (mandolin), and Alberto Villal√≥n (guitar). Colombo and Garc√≠a were regular members of the Teatro Alhambra company; Colombo was the most recorded singer of the age.D√≠az Ayala, Crist√≥bal 1994. Cuba canta y baila: discograf√≠a de la m√∫sica cubana 1898‚Äì1925. p193 et seq. A difference between Villal√≥n and the other early trovadors was in his guitar technique. With his training he preferred picking (punteado) instead of strumming (rasgueado), which had been the main technique previously. This gave him a wider range of harmonic possibilities and a characteristic style. He had a second career in 1927 when he became a founding member of the Septeto Nacional de Ignacio Pi√±eiro. Alberto brought into the septet Juan de la Cruz and Benvenido Le√≥n, who had been playing with him in a trio. The addition of the first really great sonero, Abelardo Barroso (1905 - 1972), made the Nacional the best group in Cuba for its time. Villal√≥n's career, then, connected the world of trova with the world of son which became central to Cuba's popular music for the rest of the century. == References == *Hermanas Mart√≠: M√∫sica de Alberto Villal√≥n.

He was born in Wandsworth, South London, where he was educated at Emanuel School. He joined the King's Royal Rifle Corps in 1943, to fight in World War II. After the war he entered the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. Together with his friend Eric James Mellon he then started a pottery workshop in Hillesden, Buckinghamshire. Later he left to work on his own, and moved to Arundel, West Sussex. Here he developed his ceramics further, coming up with several innovative techniques. An eye operation in 1994 left him unable to look through the hole in the pottery kiln, and after this he started focusing on painting instead. Davis's work is characteristic for breaking with the functionalistic style of Bernard Leach, which was prevalent in the post-war years. Davis was self-taught within the field of pottery, and his method has been described as \\"working as much by instinct as plan\\". His pottery was featured at several separate exhibitions, and he had commissions from the Barbican Centre and the British embassies in Brasilia, Rome, Warsaw, and Riyadh. Davis met his wife Ruth Lambert in Ventnor on the Isle of Wight, where he spent some time in a sanatorium after college, suffering from tuberculosis. Ruth, a patient at the same institution, was also a painter. The couple married in 1953, and they had one son.

He was the first person from his country to play for an English county, representing Middlesex from 1919 to 1922. He was widely regarded as the best fielder in county cricket at the time. Gunasekara was educated at Royal College in Colombo where he was captain of the cricket team and achieved colours in both athletics and football. He moved to England in order to study medicine at Cambridge University and excelled again at sports, only missing out on a Blue due to the outbreak of the War. In 1919 he made his first-class debut for Middlesex and went on to have a good all-round Championship season, with 36 wickets at 27.72 and 351 runs at 21.93. Despite batting at nine, he top scored for Middlesex in the first innings of their match against Surrey at Kennington Oval with 88 not out. His best performance with the ball came against Lancashire where he dismissed their last five batsmen to finish with 5/15. The following summer he was part of Middlesex's successful campaign for the 1920 County Championship. He didn't play at all in 1921 but returned in 1922 for one final season. Having completed his degree, Gunasekara returned to Ceylon and became captain of his country's cricket team. He captained Ceylon's first overseas touring team, to India in 1932-33, but was called back to Ceylon during the tour in his capacity as Chief Medical Officer of Health, Colombo Municipality, in order to deal with a smallpox outbreak, and was absent during the two matches against India, when Ed Kelaart captained the team in his absence.S.

In 1817 his father, a merchant shipowner and agent at Arichat, Nova Scotia, petitioned for land grants at Belle Vue on the Strait of Canso, where he built a stone house and had settled by 1822. Henry was educated in Guernsey and at the Wolfville Academy (today Acadia University), and served as a lieutenant-captain in the Canadian Militia during the Fenian raids. He spent his early life as an insurance agent in the City of Halifax. He was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in 1882 as a Member of the Conservative Party for Richmond, Nova Scotia. In Parliament, he was a strong supporter of Sir John A. Macdonald, the first prime minister of Canada, and he promoted a large number of public and infrastructure works for Cape Breton, including the first marine railway, the first steamers from Boston, numerous wharves and warehouses, as well as post offices and lighthouses, and the bridge and railroad to Arichat, and he was instrumental in negotiating favourable trading terms for the Dominion with Norway and the West Indies. He contested the three general elections of 1887, 1891 and 1904, but despite his successes for the community, he was defeated on each occasion. Henry was a progressive merchant and community leader. He owned extensive property on Cape Breton Island. Apart from the family estate of at Canso, in 1863 he acquired commercial property at Point Tupper, Nova Scotia, a few miles from Port Hawkesbury, on a site 'exceedingly well situated for trade' at the main entry point between mainland Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Island. Here he constructed wharves and laid out a new township, selling plots doggedly to the end of his life; today he is commemorated there by 'Henry Paint Street'. His other holdings included the 'Paint seam' in coal mines at Victoria County, Nova Scotia and gypsum options at Brierley Brook in Antigonish County. Henry Paint has a street, Paint Street, named after him in Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia. Henry Paint's long life is exceptionally well documented for the period, largely from letters written in his old age to his grandchildren, some of which were published in 2005. He died at his house at 3 Artillery Place, Halifax, aged 91. His younger daughter, Mary Le Mesurier, married Sir Charles Tertius Mander, first baronet, of the Mander family, industrialists and philanthropists dominant in the English Midlands. His elder daughter, Flora St Clair, married Sir Charles's first cousin, Theodore Mander, builder of Wightwick Manor, one of the most notable Arts and Crafts movement houses in England. ==Sources== *Nicholas Mander, Varnished leaves : a biography of the Mander family of Wolverhampton, 1750-1950.

Smith started his career in the youth teams of Partick Thistle and Rangers before making his first senior appearances in the Scottish Football League with Greenock Morton. He also played for Dumbarton, Ayr United, Falkirk, Stirling Albion and Clyde. ==CareerRangers=== Smith began his footballing career as a youth at Partick Thistle as a YTS, before moving on to SPL side Rangers. Chris was released by Rangers under-19s at the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season. ===Morton=== Smith went on trial at Greenock Morton and played in several trial matches, before he was eventually signed on 5 September 2008. Smith made his league debut against QOS on 13 September 2008, at Palmerston Park, Dumfries, and his full debut the week previously in the Challenge Cup quarter-final against the same opposition. In his first four league games, he played as the left-back in a back four, alongside Ryan Harding, Dominic Shimmin and Alex Walker. At the beginning of 2009, Smith was given a contract extension until the end the season. This was despite his howler against Airdrie United a few days earlier, which saw him axed from the first team squad against Partick Thistle on 30 December. Smith was released in May 2009, after being dropped for the last month of the season. After his release from Cappielow, Smith went on trial at Conference Premier club Wrexham. ===Dumbarton=== On 3 August 2009, Smith signed for Dumbarton. ===Ayr United=== In 2010, Chris Smith left Dumbarton, to join fellow Second Division club, Ayr United. In the 2010‚Äì11 season, Smith scored only once, away to Alloa Athletic, United lost 4‚Äì1. In the following season Smith scored two goals: The winner against St Mirren in the Quarter-Finals of the League Cup at St Mirren Park and the winner only four days later in a 3‚Äì2 victory for Ayr United against Hamilton Academical at New Douglas Park in the League. ===Falkirk=== In June 2012, Smith signed for Falkirk after Ayr United were relegated to the Second Division. In February 2013, Smith had re-signed for Ayr United on loan, after only featuring for Falkirk six times since joining in June, the last away to Dumbarton in October. ===Stirling Albion=== Smith first played 45 minutes for The Binos in a 2‚Äì0 friendly win against Airdrieonians. The following Saturday, he played the full game against former club Falkirk, a match which ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw.

Her sole defeat came in her final race, the 2010 Breeders' Cup Classic where she lost by a neck to Blame in an attempt to repeat her win in the 2009 event. Despite the loss, she was named the 2010 American Horse of the Year. She was also the American Champion Older Female Horse in 2008, 2009 and 2010. She was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 2016. Zenyatta was purchased as a yearling by record producer Jerry Moss and his wife Ann, who named her after the album Zenyatta Mondatta, by the Police, who were signed to A&M; Records by Moss. She went into training with John Shirreffs. A late-developing filly, she did not make her first start until late in her three-year-old year, winning a maiden race in November, 2007; this was followed by a win in an allowance race in December. From 2008 through 2010, she recorded seventeen consecutive graded stakes wins, 13 of them at the Grade I level. In 2009, she became the first mare to win the Breeders' Cup Classic. Her other major wins included the Breeders' Cup Ladies Classic in 2008, the Apple Blossom Handicap in 2008 and 2010, consecutive wins in the Vanity Stakes, the Clement L. Hirsch, and the Lady's Secret, all in 2008‚Äì2010. The Lady's Secret was subsequently renamed the Zenyatta Stakes in her honor. Zenyatta developed a passionate following, attracted by a combination of her athletic prowess and her personality. She was known for the \\"dance moves\\" she made while in the walking ring and post parade prior to her races, and her taste for Guinness Stout contributed to her popularity. She was known for her closing finishes, often spotting large leads to early front runners, then overtaking her opponents in the final strides. However, sportswriter Andrew Beyer questioned the quality of the opposition, and noted that the majority of her races were on artificial surfaces in California. ==Background== Zenyatta is a dark bay mare who was bred in Kentucky by Eric Kronfeld's Maverick Production, Limited. She was sired by Street Cry, who was the 2002 UAE Horse of the Year after winning that year's Dubai World Cup. In addition to Zenyatta, Street Cry also sired 2007 Kentucky Derby-winner Street Sense, Australian Horse of the Year Winx, Australian champion Whobegotyou, and 2009 Melbourne Cup winner Shocking. Zenyatta is out of Vertigineux, and thus is a half-sister to multiple Grade I winner Balance. Vertigineux, a winning daughter of Kris S., was named the 2008 Kentucky Broodmare of the Year. Zenyatta was sold as a yearling at the 2005 Keeneland September Sale for $60,000 to Jerry and Ann Moss. The relatively low price was the result of a skin disease that broke out a few days before the sale. She was named after the album Zenyatta Mondatta, by The Police, who were signed to A&M; Records by Jerry Moss.Miamiherald.com March 10, 2011 She was trained by John Shirreffs and guided by jockey Mike Smith for 17 of 20 starts. David Flores rode Zenyatta in her first three starts. At maturity, Zenyatta's height was reported by various sources at between and at the withers. Her stride was estimated at . Her conformation is generally good with a \\"tremendous\\" shoulder and hip, but \\"less than ideal\\" ankles. During her racing career, she reportedly weighed . Shirreffs was patient while she grew into her large frame. Soon after Zenyatta arrived at his stable, he commented to Dottie Ingordo-Shirreffs, his wife and stable manager, \\"If I can get her right, she'll be my Michael Jordan.\\" Behind the backstretch, Zenyatta was known as a kind and curious horse with a \\"Zen-like calm\\". Before races, she relaxed herself by walking or prancing with an elevated stride, leading to comparisons with dressage horses. \\"She stretches so much doing all that dancing that she's actually ready to go\\", said Smith. \\"You don't have to do a lot with her. She knows that people around her are watching. She knows that she not only has to go out there and compete, but she has the whole package. She's a great entertainer.\\" ==Racing career2007: three-year-old season=== On November 22, 2007, Zenyatta made her debut in a Maiden Special Weight at a distance of furlongs over Hollywood Park's artificial track surface. She broke last in a field of twelve and was still in tenth place after half a mile. She swung wide turning into the stretch and drew clear to win by three lengths. On December 15, Zenyatta made her next start in an allowance race at Hollywood Park over a distance of miles. She trailed the field for the first half mile then began to move into position while swinging wide on the final turn. In the stretch, she drew along the early leader and continued to draw off to win handily by lengths. ===2008: four-year-old season=== On January 13, 2008, Zenyatta made her four-year-old debut in the Grade II El Encino Stakes at Santa Anita Park. The field contained Grade I winners Tough Tiz's Sis and Romance is Diane, who both carried 122 pounds. Since Zenyatta had not yet won at the stakes level, she received a six-pound allowance. She broke last in the field of six but was only four lengths behind Tough Tiz's Sis, who set a moderate pace of 47.77 seconds for the first half mile. Zenyatta swung wide turning into the stretch and steadily made up ground, drawing clear in the final strides to win by lengths over Tough Tiz's Sis. \\"She could be anything, I mean really anything\\", said Jerry Moss. \\"We're just so proud of her and enjoying every day with her.\\" Zenyatta traveled to Oaklawn Park in Arkansas on April 5 for her first start on dirt and her first Grade 1 attempt. It was also the first time she was ridden by Hall of Fame jockey Mike Smith, who rode her thereafter for the remainder of her career. She faced champion Ginger Punch, who had won the 2007 Breeders' Cup Ladies Classic and was heavily favored at odds of 2‚Äì5. Ginger Punch went to the early lead and set a moderate pace with Zenyatta lengths back after half a mile. Zenyatta began her move midway on the final turn while swinging four wide. She reached the lead in mid stretch and won going away by lengths over Brownie Points, with Ginger Punch a further lengths back in third. Zenyatta returned to California for her next start at Hollywood Park on May 31 in the Milady Handicap. She broke poorly and was squeezed back but remained fairly closely bunched with the other four horses as Romance is Diane set \\"turtle-like fractions\\" of 24.74 seconds for the opening quarter mile and 48.19 for the half. Despite the slow pace, Zenyatta was able to close strongly down the stretch and drew clear by lengths under a hand ride. \\"She always makes everyone look like they stopped\\", said Ann Moss. \\"It's like she's out for a gallop and everyone else is stopping.\\" Zenyatta in the walking ring at the 2008 Breeders' Cup, doing her \\"dance\\" with a front leg On July 5, she was entered in the Vanity Handicap at Hollywood Park. She was assigned top weight of 124 pounds, while her main rivals Tough Tiz's Sis and Sealy Hill carried 121 and 118 pounds respectively. Zenyatta made an earlier move than usual and took the lead in mid-stretch, then held off Tough Tiz's Sis to win by half a length. Smith felt Zenyatta had not been at her best. \\"She was not tested at all, but I was tested\\", he said. \\"She was just pulling [herself] up the whole time. Around the turn, she was pricking her ears. She was not even running. She was basically galloping through the stretch. She made me work hard, but she was just loafing.\\" On August 2, she was entered in the Clement L. Hirsch Handicap at Del Mar. She again carried top weight of 124 pounds, spotting her seven rivals from five to twelve pounds. She trailed early behind a fast early pace and was eleven lengths behind after half a mile. She began making up ground around the far turn and moved to the lead in the final sixteenth of a mile to win by a length. She set a new track record of 1:41.48 for miles. On September 27, Zenyatta entered the Lady's Secret Stakes at Santa Anita Park. Her main rival in the four-horse field was Grade I winner Hystericalady, who came into the race off an eight-length win in the Molly Pitcher. Hystericalady went to the early lead and set a slow early pace. Zenyatta relaxed in fourth place just a few lengths behind, then swung wide turning into the stretch. She gained the lead in midstretch and drew off under moderate urging to win by lengths. She clocked negative splits throughout the race, running each quarter faster than the one before it. Her splits were :24 4/5, :23 4/5, :23 1/5, :22 3/5, with a final sixteenth in :06 flat. She finished the miles in a stakes- record 1:40.30 and established herself as the heavy favorite for the Breeders' Cup Ladies' Classic in October. On October 24, 2008, Zenyatta was sent off as the 1‚Äì2 favorite for the Breeders' Cup Ladies' Classic, held during the Oak Tree meeting at Santa Anita. The field included four other horses who had won at the Grade I level in 2008: Ginger Punch, who had won the Ogden Phipps and Go For Wand Handicaps since losing to Zenyatta in the Apple Blossom, Carriage Trail (Spinster Stakes), Cocoa Beach (Beldame) and Music Note (Gazelle Stakes). Zenyatta dropped back at the start behind a moderate pace set by Bear Now. Still lengths behind after three-quarters of a mile, she started to make up ground on the final turn. She circled the field at the top of the stretch and won by lengths over Cocoa Beach. Her time of 1:46.85 for miles was the second-fastest in the race's history. \\"Today, she was just showing off\\", said Smith. \\"Used to be, she'd get nervous and sweaty when the people were hollering at her. Today, she just started dancing when they did that. She's just figured it out.\\" With a perfect record of seven wins in 2008, all at the Grade I or II level, Zenyatta was the easy winner of the Eclipse Award for Champion Older Female Horse. She finished second in the voting for Horse of the Year to Curlin, who had won five of his seven starts. Her win in the Ladies Classic was named the NTRA Moment of the Year. ===2009: five-year-old season=== Zenyatta was given a layoff after the Breeders' Cup, then resumed training in February. She was expected to make her four-year-old debut on May 1, 2009 in the Louisville Distaff at Churchill Downs. However, she was scratched from the race after heavy rains made the track sloppy. Instead, she made her first start of the year on May 23, 2009 in the Milady Handicap at Hollywood Park. She was assigned the top weight of 126 lbs, conceding four pounds to stablemate Life is Sweet, who was also a Grade I winner, and up to 14 pounds to the other horses in the field of six. Behind a moderate pace, Zenyatta dropped to the back of the pack, trailing by twelve lengths after half a mile. She started her move on the far turn and was forced to briefly check. Smith swung Zenyatta wide and she took the lead with a sixteenth of a mile remaining to win by lengths over Life Is Sweet. Smith explained that he and Garrett Gomez, the jockey of Life is Sweet, \\"played some games\\" while battling for position on the turn. \\"It was all clean and fair. She's so handy that when I eased up on the pedal, she backed up for me, came around and it was over.\\" On June 27, Zenyatta faced five rivals in the Vanity Handicap at Hollywood Park. She carried 129 lbs, while Grade II winners Dawn After Dawn and Briecat carried 114 and 116 pounds respectively. Briecat went to the early lead and set moderate fractions. Zenyatta rated lengths behind down the backstretch, then moved wide to take the lead in the stretch. She won by lengths over Briecat in a time of 1:48.15 for miles. \\"It was a short field and she had a lot of weight on her and I didn't want her to have so much to do, so I stayed a little closer than normal\\", said Smith. \\"But when I asked her, she lengthened her stride and it was pretty much over then.\\" On August 9, Zenyatta faced a field of six in the Clement L. Hirsch, now run as a stakes race under allowance weight conditions. She and Life is Sweet both carried 123 pounds, with the other fillies and mares carrying 119 pounds. Lethal Heat went to the early lead and set a very slow pace of :48.84 for the half mile and 1:13.64 for the three-quarters. Zenyatta was still last at that point with lengths to make up on the relatively fresh front runners. With a furlong left to run, she still had lengths to make up, but closed to win by a head over Anabaa's Creation. Because of the slow early pace, she completed the miles in 1:43.24, nearly two seconds slower than her time in the previous year's race. However, she had run the final quarter in an excellent 22.49 seconds, hitting a speed of roughly 40 miles per hour. Smith admitted that he had underestimated the rest of the field while focused on tracking Life is Sweet, who finished fourth. \\"But then I looked up and the competition had gotten away from both of us. I just kind of flagged (Zenyatta) with the stick and she started hitting that stride.\\" On October 10, Zenyatta again faced off with Life is Sweet, Lethal Heat and Cocoa's Beach in the Lady's Secret Stakes at Oak Tree at Santa Anita. Behind another slow early place, she stayed closer to the early leaders this time. She took the lead in deep stretch and pulled clear to win by lengths under a hand ride. This extended her winning streak to thirteen, tying her with Personal Ensign for the longest undefeated record at the elite level in North American racing history. Smith said she had several gears to spare despite the ease of her victory. \\"She has an amazing turn of foot\\", said Smith, \\"one that I've never seen before. No disrespect to the other horses today, but she only ran about four jumps when we turned for home and then she shut it down.\\" Breeders' Cup Classic On November 7, Zenyatta's connections opted to enter her against male horses in the 2009 Breeders' Cup Classic at Santa Anita Park instead of trying to defend her title in the Ladies' Classic. Life is Sweet confirmed the quality of Zenyatta's west coast opposition by winning the latter race by lengths. Meanwhile, Zenyatta faced a deep field of twelve in the Classic. The Polytrack racing surface was a factor in the betting on the race: some horses that ran well on natural dirt did not adapt well to the \\"plastics\\", whereas some turf-based horses handled it very well. European-based horses had run one-two in the 2008 Classic and two Group One winners, Rip Van Winkle and Twice Over, were among the favorites in the 2009 version. The North America contenders included three-year olds Mine That Bird (Kentucky Derby) and Summer Bird (Belmont Stakes, Travers and Jockey Club Gold Cup). Among the older horses in the race, Gio Ponti, who had won the Arlington Million and Man o' War, was highly regarded, as were Einstein (Santa Anita Handicap), Colonel John (a Grade I winner who was second in the Goodwood Stakes in his previous start) and Richard's Kid (Pacific Classic). Zenyatta caused a brief delay before allowing herself to be loaded in the starting gate. As she started to settle, Quality Road started to create problems of his own, bucking and rearing up in the outside stall before breaking through the barrier. Quality Road was scratched while all the other horses were unloaded and reloaded. When the race finally began, Zenyatta was flat footed and trailed the field by lengths after the first quarter, run by pacesetter Regal Ransom in a leisurely 24.16 seconds. She was still 9 lengths behind after three-quarters of a mile, but began making up position while racing just off the rail around the final turn. Still in ninth and lengths back with a quarter mile remaining, Smith swung her to the outside for racing room. Zenyatta accelerated and began to rapidly gain ground, then pulled clear to win by a length over Gio Ponti. Track announcer Trevor Denman had kept an eye on the mare throughout the race, noting she had a lot of work to do at the top of the stretch. As she moved to the lead, he exclaimed, \\"Zenyatta is flying on the grandstand side. This, is, un-be-lievable! What a performance! We will never see another like this.\\" Zenyatta was given a hero's welcome on her return to the winner's circle, with many fans holding signs honoring \\"Queen Z.\\" Ann Moss said, \\"Every moment with her is just a pleasure. And she's so feminine. She's just dancing and strutting and enjoying her beautiful, majestic self. And that's a gift.\\" Zenyatta became the first mare to win the Breeders' Cup Classic, and also the first horse to win two different Breeders' Cup races. \\"She's a freak, what can I say?\\" said Gio Ponti's trainer, Christophe Clement. \\"My horse ran a great race, but he couldn't beat her.\\" \\"I believe if there was another horse ahead of [Gio Ponti]\\", said Smith, \\"she would have caught him, too. She still had run left.\\" The win set up a spirited debate over who should be Horse of the Year: Zenyatta or the equally brilliant three-year-old filly Rachel Alexandra. Both were undefeated over the course of 2009. Zenyatta had won the Classic while beating the strongest field of the year. However, Rachel Alexandra had dominated the field in the Kentucky Oaks, the filly equivalent of the Kentucky Derby, then beat the colts in the Preakness Stakes, becoming the first filly to win that race since 1924. She finished her year with wins in the Haskell against colts and the Woodward Stakes against older male horses. Rachel Alexandra ultimately won the balloting by 130 votes to 99. On December 22, Zenyatta was runner-up to tennis player Serena Williams for 2009 Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year. The Oak Tree racing association announced that they would rename the Lady's Secret stake in her honor. On December 26, opening day of the 75th year of the Santa Anita meet, Zenyatta jogged around the grandstand in what was then thought to be the final racetrack appearance of her career. ===2010: six-year-old season=== The Mosses initially had intended to retire Zenyatta after the Classic, but announced on January 16, 2010, that she would remain in training. On January 18, Zenyatta won her second Eclipse Award as American Champion Older Female Horse of the 2009 season. Since the middle of 2009, attempts had been made to have Rachel Alexandra and Zenyatta face each other directly on the racetrack. On February 5, Oaklawn Park announced that it would increase the purse of the Apple Blossom to $5 million if both horses entered the race. Oaklawn also changed the distance of the race to miles and made it an invitational event for the 2010 running. Both sets of connections indicated their intention to attend if their horses were in top form. On March 13, Zenyatta made her six-year-old debut in the Santa Margarita Invitational Handicap at Santa Anita Park. She was assigned 127 lbs and spotted her seven rivals 11 to 16 pounds. She wove through traffic mid-stretch to get clear and won under a hand ride, eased before the wire. She completed the miles in 1:48.20 and won by lengths. On the same day though, Rachel Alexandra, who had not run since September 2009, was defeated in the New Orleans Ladies Stakes at Fair Grounds Race Course. It was later announced that she would not run in the Apple Blossom. The two horses would never meet. With the purse reverting to $500,000, the Apple Blossom attracted a field of just five, with Zenyatta the overwhelming favorite at 1-20. She made her usual move on the final turn and coasted to a -length win. She completed the miles in 1:50.71. Her record of sixteen consecutive wins matched Cigar, Mister Frisky and Citation for the longest winning streak for North American horses in races not restricted to state-breds. On June 13, 2010, Zenyatta won her 17th straight race in the Vanity Handicap at Hollywood Park by half a length under 129 pounds. Still in last place at the head of the stretch, she was at first unable to close ground on St. Trinians, to whom she conceded 9 pounds. Smith noted that although Zenyatta had \\"hit a real big gear\\" in the stretch, St. Trinians had responded in kind. \\"I said, Whoa, [St. Trinians] is serious. She's going to make me run. I was working at it until the last 100 yards and then I knew I'd outgrind her.\\" With the win, Zenyatta surpassed the records of Citation and Cigar for consecutive victories in unrestricted races. She also tied the world record set by Rock of Gibraltar for consecutive Grade/Group I victories. On August 7, Zenyatta was the 1-10 favorite in the Clement L. Hirsch at Del Mar. The pace was very slow ‚Äì :25.41 for the first quarter-mile and :50.61 for the half. Zenyatta started her move on the turn and hit the lead earlier than usual. Although she was never hard pressed, she won by only a neck. \\"She was literally playing\\", said Smith. \\"I hit the button a little too soon. When she gets in front, she thinks its over. She wants to salute the fans.\\" The win broke the world record set by Rock of Gibraltar for consecutive Grade/Group I victories. It also tied Eclipse for consecutive victories without a defeat. With the win, Zenyatta captured her 12th Grade I race and tied the All-time North American record (set by two-time champion Bayakoa) for Grade I victories by a filly/mare. Shirreffs had considered sending Zenyatta to the east coast for her final prep for the Breeders' Cup. However, he ultimately decided to keep her at home and entered her in the Lady's Secret on October 2 instead (the name change for the race to the Zenyatta Stakes was deferred for a year). The race was held at Hollywood Park because of concerns over the Santa Anita racing surface. Zenyatta broke slowly and took her normal place at the back of the pack but was only lengths behind after half a mile. She swung to the outside coming off the final turn and gradually took the lead and drew off to win by half a length. Zenyatta broke the North American record for Grade I victories by a filly/mare with her 13th Grade I win. It was also her ninth consecutive Grade I victory (then a world record, since tied by Frankel, then broken by Winx). In addition, she broke the all-time North American female earnings record (formerly held by Ouija Board). On November 6, Zenyatta attempted to become the first North American horse to retire undefeated with 20 wins and the second horse to repeat in the Breeders' Cup Classic after Tiznow. She faced one of the strongest fields in the history of the race, including Blame (Stephen Foster Handicap and Whitney Handicap); Lookin at Lucky (Preakness and Haskell Invitational); Quality Road (Metropolitan Handicap, Donn Handicap and Woodward Stakes); Paddy O'Prado (Secretariat Stakes); First Dude (runner-up in the Preakness); Espoir City(Japan Cup Dirt); and Haynesfield (Jockey Club Gold Cup). \\"I would imagine that when this race was designed, when they came up with the concept in 1982, this is what they had in mind\\", said trainer Todd Pletcher. \\"It brings the best horses in the world together, on a neutral playing field, on a traditional dirt surface. We'll see what happens.\\" Zenyatta had a sluggish start and seemed to struggle with the surface ‚Äî‚Äì looking \\"like a rocking horse\\", according to The New York Times. After half a mile, she trailed the early leaders by 15 lengths. Around the far turn, she started to make up ground. Blame had also started his move and reached the lead by mid-stretch. Zenyatta was moving fast but faced a wall of horses in front of her. Smith moved her out wide then made several more adjustments before the mare was able to find running room. In deep stretch, she started to close ground rapidly but came up a neck short. After the race, Smith was in tears, blaming himself for the defeat. \\"I got away slow and got squeezed out of there\\", he said. \\"I couldn't level her off. If you have to blame anyone today, it would be me.\\" \\"In defeat she didn't lose anything\\", said Al Stall Jr, the trainer of Blame. \\"I don't think you'll find anybody criticizing anything she's ever done, much less today. We were fortunate to have the right horse on the right day at the right time.\\" With her second-place earnings of $900,000, Zenyatta surpassed Tiznow, John Henry, and Alysheba in all-time North American earnings (male or female) with earnings in excess of $7,304,580. She also broke the all-time Breeders Cup earnings record (previously held by American Horse of the Year and two-time Breeders Cup Classic champion Tiznow). At the time, the top-five Breeders Cup earners were: Zenyatta: $4,680,000, Tiznow: $4,560,400, Goldikova (IRE): $3,508,200, Conduit (IRE): $3,240,000, and Curlin: $2,955,000. With three Grade I wins in 2010 and the head-to-head victory over Zenyatta, Blame's connections believed he deserved to be named Horse of the Year. Ultimately however that honor went to Zenyatta, with five Grade I wins in 2010. She was also named Champion Older Female Horse while Blame was unanimously named the Champion Older Male Horse. On December 18, 2010, Zenyatta was runner-up to skier Lindsey Vonn for 2010 Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year. On January 20, 2011, Penny Chenery announced that Zenyatta was named the 2010 recipient of the Secretariat Vox Populi Award. On March 23, 2011, Zenyatta became the first horse to win the William H. May Award. The award honors an individual or group that has provided \\"meritorious service\\" to the industry. Past recipients include racing industry greats such as John R. Gaines (Breeders' Cup founder), Joe Hirsch (founder of the National Turf Writers Association), Bob and Beverly Lewis, Stanley Bergstein, and Richard Duchossois. ===Competition=== Prior to the 2010 Breeders' Cup, noted handicapper Andrew Beyer wrote that he doubted that Zenyatta ranked among the greatest horses in American racing history because she had faced weaker competition in the majority of her races. All but three of her starts were in California and only two starts were against male horses. In particular, Beyer felt that the California's move to artificial \\"all weather\\" track surfaces during her racing career deprived some of her rivals of one of the historical strengths of California-based horses: early speed. In her narrow defeat to Blame at Churchill Downs on a traditional dirt surface, she overcame many of those doubts as the 2010 Classic was considered one of the deepest fields in its history with seven Grade I winners. Zenyatta defeated two champions in the 2009 Breeders' Cup Classic (Gio Ponti and Summer Bird), champion Ginger Punch in the 2008 Breeders' Cup Ladies Classic, and Canadian champion Sealy Hill in the 2008 Vanity. Other Grade I/Group One winners that she defeated included: Colonel John; Richard's Kid; Einstein; Tough Tiz's Sis; Cocoa Beach; Music Note; Life Is Sweet; Switch; Rip Van Winkle; Twice Over; Awesome Gem; Girolamo; Mine That Bird; Hystericalady; Romance Is Diane; Double Trouble; Santa Teresita; and Carriage Trail. ==Racing Statistics== { class = \\" sortable\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:90%\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Date ! scope=\\"col\\"  Age ! scope=\\"col\\"  Distance ! scope=\\"col\\"  Race ! scope=\\"col\\"  Grade ! scope=\\"col\\"  Track ! scope=\\"col\\"  Surface ! scope=\\"col\\"  Odds ! scope=\\"col\\"  Field ! scope=\\"col\\"  Finish ! scope=\\"col\\"  Winning Time ! scope=\\"col\\"  Winning (Losing) Margin ! scope=\\"col\\"  Jockey ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" Ref -   3  furlongs  Maiden Special Weight   Hollywood Park  All weather  5.50  12  1  1:15.22  3 lengths   -   3  miles  Allowance   Hollywood Park  All weather  1.20*  7  1  1:40.97  lengths   -   4  miles  El Encino Stakes  II  Santa Anita Park  All weather  1.20*  6  1  1:40.61  lengths   -   4  miles  Apple Blossom Handicap  I  Oaklawn Park  Dirt  1.80  6  1  1:42.64  lengths   -   4  miles  Milady Handicap  II  Hollywood Park  All weather  0.30*  5  1  1:41.17  lengths   -   4  miles  Vanity Handicap  I  Hollywood Park  All weather  0.30*  7  1  1:49.51  length   -   4  miles  Clement L.

She finished second in the voting for AP Female Athlete of the Year in both 2009 and 2010. She was featured in Ohttp://www.oprah.com/world/The-2010-O-Power-List/20 and W Magazine and in a profile on 60 Minutes in 2010 prior to her historic attempt at 20 consecutive victories in the 2010 Breeders Cup Classic. In a public opinion poll by the Daily Racing Form, 87% of people voted for her to be the 2010 Eclipse Horse of the Year. Thousands appeared for her retirement ceremonies at Hollywood Park and Keeneland Race Track despite frigid 18-degree temperatures at Keeneland. ==Retirement== On November 17, 2010, Zenyatta was slated to be retired. She arrived at Lane's End Farm in Versailles, Kentucky, on December 6, 2010.Guardian News Retrieved November 18, 2010 On February 23, 2011, she traveled by van to Darley Stud, where she was bred to Bernardini.Bloodhorse.com February 23, 2011 On March 29, after coming up negative on a 45-day pregnancy checkup, Zenyatta was bred again to Bernardini.Bloodhorse.com March 29, 2011 She was announced to be in foal 60 days later. Zenyatta later give birth to a dark bay colt, eventually named Cozmic One, on March 8, 2012. Cozmic One had two starts in 2015 and performed poorly at the track. He was subsequently retired and in 2018 became an ambassador for the Retired Racehorse Project after training at De Sousa Stables. On May 8, 2012, she was confirmed in foal to Tapit. She delivered a chestnut colt, Ziconic, on April 1, 2013, her 9th birthday. Ziconic began his racing career in 2016, and, like his dam, demonstrated a come from behind running style. Ziconic was winless in twelve starts, though did run second twice and third an additional three times, making him more successful than his older half brother. On June 12, 2019, it was announced that Ziconic was retired from racing and would retrain as an eventer. On June 14, 2013, she was confirmed in foal to Claiborne Farm stallion War Front. She delivered a dark bay filly, nicknamed \\"Z Princess\\", on Easter, April 20, 2014, at 12:03 am. The filly was euthanized as a weanling on October 28, 2014 at Rood & Riddle Equine Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky, after an accident in the paddock. On May 27, 2015, Zenyatta was confirmed to be in foal, again bred to War Front, after receiving a year off from breeding. She gave birth to a dark bay colt with a blaze on April 10, 2016. The colt died two days later due to complications from meconium aspiration syndrome. Zenyatta was bred to Medaglia d'Oro on May 2, 2016, and delivered a bay filly on May 9, 2017, at 8:50 pm. The filly was named Zellda, and is in training with Shirreffs. She was next bred to Into Mischief on June 3, 2017, and confirmed in foal in July, but lost the pregnancy in April 2018 following a placental abruption. She was not bred in 2018 to give her time to recover.http://www.zenyatta.com/news/zenyattas-2018-pregnancy Zenyatta's 2018 Pregnancyhttp://www.zenyatta.com/news/taking-time-off Taking Time Off Zenyatta was bred for the 2019 breeding season to Candy Ride and produced a filly on May 17, 2020. ==PedigreeSee also== *List of leading Thoroughbred racehorses *Repeat winners of horse races ==References== * Zenyatta's pedigree and racing stats * Biography for Zenyatta at the official Breeders Cup website ==External links== * Official Zenyatta website Category:2004 racehorse births Category:Breeders' Cup Classic winners Category:Breeders' Cup Distaff winners Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Horse racing track record setters Category:Eclipse Award winners Category:American Thoroughbred Horse of the Year Category:Thoroughbred family 4-r Category:United States Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame inductees Category:Horse monuments ","title":"Zenyatta"},{"id":"19302863","text":"The Canton of La Souterraine is a canton situated in the Creuse d√©partement and in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of central France. == Geography == An area of farming and forestry in the arrondissement of Gu√©ret, centred on the town of La Souterraine.

Soleilmont Abbey () is an abbey of Trappistine nuns (O.C.S.O., or Order of Cistercians of the Strict Obervance) situated in the forest and commune of Fleurus, at Gilly near Charleroi, Belgium, founded, according to tradition, in the 11th century, which became Cistercian in 1237. The nuns were expelled as a consequence of the French Revolution in 1796, but soon re-established themselves in 1802. The community became Bernardine in 1837, and Trappist in 1919. ==HistoryFoundation=== According to the foundation tradition, of which there is no confirmation, Soleilmont Abbey was founded in 1088 by Albert III, Count of Namur, and the earliest community supposedly consisted of women whose husbands had joined Godfrey of Bouillon on the First Crusade. It was possibly founded as a Benedictine monastery, but the women might simply have lived as secular canonesses and thus been free to resume their married lives, upon the safe return of their husbands. The first recorded reference to a religious house here, however, is in a charter of 1185. ===Cistercians=== In a document dated 11 January 1237, Baldwin II of Courtenay, Count of Namur, requested that the Cistercian Order accept Soleilmont Abbey, which they duly did,after inspection and a favorable report from the abbots of Villers, Val-Saint-Lambert and Grandpr√© as a dependency of Aulne Abbey. On 23 March 1238 Pope Gregory IX placed the abbey under papal protection, and, at the same time, confirmed the deed of transfer of the abbey to the Cistercians. To support his request Baldwin confirmed the gift made by his mother, Yolande of Hainaut, to the abbey of a fishpond,the abbey was later famous for its enormous fishpond, but it is not clear whether or not that was the same as that in the original gift a mill and a meadow, and although some further gifts later increased the monastic endowments, the abbey never became wealthy. On account of their lack of resources the nuns were exempted in 1640, for example, from their dues to the Cistercian Order, and their poverty was often mentioned in the assessments of goods that were customarily made at the elections of an abbess. Soleilmont was affected by the general decadence of monastic life that took place throughout the 14th century, to the extent that by 1414 it had been decided that the only option was to close the monastery. As a final resort before closure, however, a new abbess, Marie de Senzeille, was sent to Soleilmont from , another monastery in the County of Namur, to attempt to re-establish order, which she did so successfully that Soleilmont was not only reprieved but became a model for other communities of nuns in the monastic revival of the 15th century. The 15th century Margot of Hainaut, celebrated for her abilities as a player of jeu de paume, a precursor of tennis, spent her later years as a nun in Soleilmont. Abbaye Notre-Dame de Soleilmont √† Gilly (1604). Albums de Cro√ø, Biblioth√®que Nationale, Paris. Prominent abbesses of the 16th century were Oda de Virsel and Madeleine Bulteau (resigned 1603), whose successor, Jacqueline Colnet (d. 1639), was a friend of Albert VII, Archduke of Austria and his consort, the Infanta Isabel of Spain, to whom she gave, from the relics of the abbey, a Holy Nail. She was principally remembered in the region however for twice ending attacks of the Black Death in the town of Ch√¢telet, in 1628 and again in 1636, by having the abbey's famous image of Our Lady of Rome carried through the streets. During the wars later in the 17th century, the nuns of Soleilmont, as a poor community of unprotected women, suffered particularly from harassment and theft by the soldiery. ===French Revolution=== In 1775, Scholastique Daivier (d. 1805) succeeded as abbess, the last abbess of the ancien r√©gime. In 1790, fearing the arrival of the revolutionary armies, she moved the community from Soleilmont, along with the abbey's relics and the image of Our Lady of Rome, first to and later to Li√®ge. However, in the belief that they had moved for no good reason, they then returned to Soleilmont in 1794, just in time to be caught up in the Battle of Fleurus of 26 June 1794, which was fought literally beneath the abbey walls. In January 1797 the nuns were expelled from the abbey, but were given the use of a ch√¢teau at Farciennes by its owner, and were thus enabled to remain together as a community. Their benefactor also kept watch over the fate of the abbey buildings, which were nevertheless looted and burnt, and he acquired them on behalf of the community, who were thus able to return to them, as tenants, in 1802. ===Bernardines=== The next three decades were very difficult times: the community was penniless, demoralized and aging, and soon numbered only four. In 1837, however, with the help of the Cistercian nuns of at Borgloon, they were able to buy back the premises, and, in order to generate income, opened a girls' boarding school. At the same time, under the influence of the nearby Aum√¥niers du Travail, they became a Bernardine community.The Bernardines originated as a reform movement of Cistercian nuns, with an emphasis on practical good works such as teaching and running hospitals, but they had become fragmented over time, and those of Belgium were not at this period officially attached to the Cistercian Order This was a new dawn for Soleilmont, both spiritually and economically: they attracted many new vocations, and were able to refurbish and reconstruct the abbey buildings. The times of plenty continued up to World War I, during which, in 1916, the school had to close. ===Trappistines=== Ruins of Soleilmont abbey church, destroyed in a 1963 fire. In 1919 the remaining nuns returned to the mainstream Cistercian mode of life, and were incorporated into the Trappist Order in 1922, under the supervision of Westmalle Abbey, as their original supervisory community of monks, Aulne Abbey, had ceased to function. Under this new direction Soleilmont again flourished, to the extent that in 1950 they were able to provide the 13 nuns needed to establish the new foundation of Brecht Abbey. On Christmas Eve 1963 the abbey was completely burnt down, just after the night offices. A completely new monastery was built a few hundred yards from the ruins of the old one, in the woods of Soleilmont, in a totally modern style, which was finished in 1973. ==Today== The present community of about thirty run a farm and a bakery, and make liturgical vestments. A dozen or so rooms are available in their guesthouse for the accommodation of women on retreat. Every year, on the last Sunday of August, the image of Our Lady of Rome is carried in procession round Ch√¢telineau nearby in memory of the protection received by that town in 1628 and 1636 against the outbreaks of the plague. Soleilmont Abbey has a daughter foundation in Kerala, India. ==NotesSources== *Fleurus: Soleilmont *Philagodu.be: brief history of Soleilmont Abbey *Photographs of Soleilmont Abbey *OCSO official directory: Soleilmont Abbey, Fleurus ==References== * Canivez, Joseph-Marie, 1926: L'Ordre de Citeaux en Belgique.

Mainly a central defender, he could operate on the left flank on occasion. During a 17-year professional career he appeared in seven La Liga seasons for a total of 127 games, with Racing de Santander (six years) and Sporting de Gij√≥n (one). ==Football career== Neru was born in Laredo, Cantabria. A product of hometown club Racing de Santander's youth system, he first appeared with the main squad during the 1998‚Äì99 season, already aged 24. During the following years (which included a second division stint), he would be relatively put to use in various defensive positions. In 2004‚Äì05, Neru was loaned to Segunda Divisi√≥n side Sporting de Gij√≥n, being an undisputed first-choice throughout the campaign and scoring a rare goal on 1 May 2005, in a 3‚Äì2 home win against Pontevedra CF. He returned to Santander for a further 15 La Liga games, in 2005‚Äì06. After becoming a free agent in January 2007 and an uneventful six-month stint with another second level team, C√°diz CF, Neru rejoined Gij√≥n in the ensuing summer, playing only four matches during the season as the Asturians returned to the top flight after a 10-year hiatus. In August 2009 the 35-year-old moved Deportivo Alav√©s, now in division three. However, after a run-in with the board of directors, he became surplus to requirements and, in late January 2010, moved up a tier as he signed with SD Huesca until the end of the campaign; he replaced Daniel Mustaf√°, who was released. ==Personal life== In 2011, Neru ran for office in the municipality of Laredo for the People's Party. ==References * Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:People from Laredo, Cantabria Category:Spanish footballers Category:Cantabrian footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi√≥n players Category:Segunda Divisi√≥n B players Category:Tercera Divisi√≥n players Category:Rayo Cantabria players Category:Racing de Santander players Category:Sporting de Gij√≥n players Category:C√°diz CF players Category:Deportivo Alav√©s players Category:SD Huesca footballers Category:Pontevedra CF footballers Category:Spanish football managers ","title":"Neru"},{"id":"19302891","text":"TSV Buchbach is a German association football club from the village of Buchbach, Bavaria. The team is part of a larger sports club that also has departments for curling, gymnastics, skiing, and tennis. The footballers are distinguished as former holders of the German record for the longest undefeated streak, a string of 75 matches from 19 August 1995 to 23 May 1998. ==History== TSV was founded in 1913 as a gymnastics club. Football was soon introduced to the club by students who brought the game back from Munich. A football department was established within the association on 11 January 1930. Following World War II, Buchbach played in local A-Class competition until slipping to B-Class play in 1960, where they would remain until returning to A ball in 1980. In the mid-1990s, with solid sponsorship in place, they began their record making unbeaten run.

It was assembled in response to the solid organisation of the Labor Party and had the aim of assisting Ministerial members in winning seats and retaining power in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly. The Party did not involve itself in Federal politics, although many of its members were also associated with the Commonwealth Liberal Party and assisted Liberal candidates and members from Western Australia in that capacity. The massive defeat of the Ministerial faction by Labor in that election resulted in what remained of the faction formally joining the Liberal Party, which became the first organised non-Labor movement in the State and was a precursor to the Nationalist Party and, later, the modern Liberal Party of Australia (Western Australian Division). ==Leadership== The party was led for its entire duration in Parliament by Frank Wilson, who served as Opposition Leader until 27 July 1916, and Premier thereafter. By June 1917, the party had been disbanded and fully subsumed into the Nationalist Party. ==References== * Western Australia 1901 Category:Defunct political parties in Western Australia Category:Political parties established in 1911 Category:Political parties disestablished in 1917 Category:1911 establishments in Australia Category:1917 disestablishments in Australia ","title":"Western Australian Liberal Party (1911‚Äì1917)"},{"id":"19302923","text":"\\"Ministry of State for Federal National Council Affairs, United Arab Emirates\\" As part of a multi-phased and gradual political reform process envisaged by the Government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the Presidential Federal Decree No. (10)/2006, amending Federal Law No.1/1972, created the Ministry of State for Federal National Council Affairs, headed by Dr Anwar Mohammed Gargash Al Awadhi, in early 2006. In fact, the ministry‚Äôs genesis could be traced to the National Action Program announced by UAE President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al-Nahyan in December 2005 to mark the 34th anniversary of the establishment of the UAE Federation. The plan included empowering the FNC in order to support the executive body. The strategic plan of the ministry also emanates from UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum‚Äôs push for achieving sustainable and balanced development, as well as securing prosperity for the people of the country.Ministries MOCA.President okays new cabinet Khaleej Times. (Abu Dhabi). 10 February 2006. Retrieved 10 September 2014. ==Responsibilities== According to the decree, the main responsibilities of the ministry are to: coordinate between the government and the Federal National Council (FNC), the official people‚Äôs representative body, as well as the execution of its responsibilities, participate in the preparation of legislation concerning the role of the FNC, supervise dissemination of information pertaining to parliamentary activities, and carry out other responsibilities assigned to the minister by virtue of laws, bills, federal decisions or resolutions. In view of these responsibilities, the ministry seeks to promote a participatory culture in the UAE and develop parliamentary practices in a tolerant and cohesive manner. Consequently, it works towards creating a society that genuinely participates in public life, through coordination between the government, FNC and people, as well as develop a partnership between the institutions of the state, using the best of its human and material resources to achieve the set goal.MFNCA ==Committees== Apart from these issues, the ministry also coordinates the activities a number of national committees headed by Dr. Gargash, including the National Committee to Combat Human Trafficking, Committee to Prepare the UAE‚Äôs Periodic Report on Human Rights and Committee for Monitoring Developments that Impact the Reputation of the UAE.Combating Human Trafficking UAE Interact.Gargash chairs human rights national report committee meeting UAE Interact. ==Impact== Since the ministry began to serve as a channel between the Cabinet and the FNC, it has contributed to a healthy discussion on a range of nationally relevant issues and solutions in the Council. The successful deliberations point to the evolution of strong policy-making mechanisms in the country supported by a parliamentary system built on the premises of dialogue, cooperation and action. The FNC‚Äôs recommendations on key national issues are being given increasing government priority, highlighting the strong link between the legislative and executive branches. The FNC covered topics of national interest such as policies to support the industrial sector and the economy at large in the wake of global inflationary trends, as well as matters pertaining to further improving educational standards. The ‚Äúhigh level of synergy between the government and the FNC in dealing with national issues has set the foundations for a new political culture.‚ÄùKhaleej Times ==Elections== One of the earliest tasks of the ministry was coordinating the activities of the National Election Committee, which was responsible for conducting the entire process involving the first-ever FNC polls in the country ‚Äì from the time the elections were announced till the declaration of results. The landmark elections were held on 16, 18 and 20 December 2006. Some of the highlights of the indirect election process are listed below. *Half the members of the FNC were indirectly elected by a college of councilors; and rest appointed by the rulers of the seven emirates. *Each ruler constituted a local council which had 100 times the number of FNC representatives ‚Äì for example, Abu Dhabi and Dubai, which are each entitled to eight seats on the FNC, nominated 800 electors each to their respective electoral colleges. Similarly, Sharjah and Ras Al-Khaimah are entitled to six each, while Umm Al-Qaiwain, Ajman and Fujairah are entitled to four seats each on the FNC, and were able to nominate members in multiples of 100. *All these representatives combined then elected half the members of each emirate to the FNC, with the ruler appointing the other half *The final approved Election Commission list had 6,595 members, including about 1,162 women, to be members of seven local assemblies that would vote. *In all, 452 candidates, 63 of them women, contested the elections. *While one woman was directly elected to the FNC, the government nominated eight others to the 40-member Council, which translates into 22.5 percent share of the seats. The UAE government hopes to expand the political participation and reform process in the following way. *The next stage could include an expansion of the number of members serving in the FNC, as well as increasing the FNC‚Äôs scope of authority and responsibility *The final and most advanced stage could encompass actual comprehensive and direct elections of half the FNC members.

Co. v. Barney, 113 U.S. 618 (1885) Justia.com By the Act of March 3, 1857, the United States Congress granted to the then Territory of Minnesota, in aid of the construction of certain railroads, certain alternate sections of lands along the lines of the roads, and further provided: The reservation of the lands previously granted to Minnesota from the grant of the additional four sections‚Äîthat is, from the extension of the original grant of 1857‚Äîwas only a legislative declaration of that which the law would have pronounced independently of it. Previous grants of the same property would necessarily be excluded from subsequent ones. The only embarrassment in the construction of the section arises from the inapt words used to describe the land from which the previous grant is to be deducted. The language of the section is The only lands granted by the act of 1865 were the four sections for each mile additional to the original six, accompanied with a right to select indemnity lands within twenty miles of the road. The words \\"the full quantity granted\\" only denote the entire extension. To the extent of the previous grant that extension must be reduced, even if the whole be taken. Those words did not transfer the loss from the ten sections within which the grant falls to other sections along the line. The sections in which such grant falls are correspondingly reduced. It followed that where the grant previously made to Minnesota to aid in the construction of the Minnesota and Cedar Valley Railroad interferes with the extension of the grant to the defendant by the act of 1865, the extension must be abandoned. The earlier grant takes the land which would otherwise be added to the original six sections. The court below therefore erred in holding that the Winona and St. Peter Railroad was entitled to ten full sections where such interference occurred, without deducting the lands previously granted to the state. The cause must therefore go back that the proper deduction may be made by reason of this interference of the two grants, and the elder grant be deducted from the extension made by the act of 1865. The decree was reversed and the cause remanded with directions to take further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. ==See also== *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 113 *Winona and St. Peter Railroad ==References * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Waite Court Category:1885 in United States case law Category:Railway litigation in 1885 Category:Chicago and North Western Railway ","title":"Winona &amp; St. Peter Railroad Co. v.

The label was founded in 2008 by South Australian hip hop trio Hilltop Hoods. ==History2009‚Äì2011: State Of The Art, The Blacklist, The Quickening, Marked For Death=== On 12 June 2009, in the year following the label's inception, the label's founder, the Hilltop Hoods, released its fifth album, State of the Art, through Golden Era. In November 2009, Golden Era Records signed a deal with the Funkoars, a hip hop group from South Australia‚Äîas part of the deal, the Funkoars re-released its album, The Hangover, as The Hangover: Premium Edition. Also in 2009, Aboriginal Australian MC, Briggs, released his debut EP, Homemade Bombs, with a financial loan that he received from Suffa of the Hilltop Hoods (Suffa explained in a 2012 television interview that Briggs repaid the loan in full)‚Äîthe label then signed Briggs and released his debut album, The Blacklist, in 2010. Pressure, also of the Hilltop Hoods, explained, in a 2012 television interview, the rationale behind Briggs' signing: > And one of the reasons we signed Briggs to the Golden Era label was... > because he's just got this presence. You know, he's everywhere. He's > probably the hardest-working individual in Australian hip-hop, if not one > of. He's the most self-motivated dude I've ever met ... everywhere he goes, > you know, everyone remembers Briggs. On 28 July 2010, Hilltop Hoods completed work on a \\"zombie flick\\", Parade of the Dead, which they wrote, filmed and starred in. Using the title from a State of the Art track, it was released on 22 October with the eponymous single. Filmed mostly in Adelaide, the former Adelaide Gaol was used as a \\"key location\\". Adelaide MC Vents signed to Golden Era Records before releasing his second album Marked for Death, which was created over a four-year period, in May 2011. Vents collaborated with Adfu, a Palestinian-born producer/DJ, who also signed with the label. The album's first single, \\"History of the World\\", was released on 8 April 2011 and the corresponding music video was published on the Golden Era YouTube channel on 11 April. A music video for the second single \\"Rollin' Balls\\" was published on YouTube on 2 June 2011. Marked for Death debuted at number 25 on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart and was later nominated for an ARIA Music Award in the \\"Best Urban Album\\" category.Aria Awards / 2011 Best Urban Album - 27th ARIA Awards 2013 ===2011‚Äì2013: Drinking From The Sun, Kid Sinatra EP=== In the second half of 2011, Adfu explained the significance of Golden Era from his perspective: > Golden Era is amazing because we all go way, way back ... We all live pretty > much with a 20-minute drive radius of each other and we're good friends. > It's so much different when you're working in that kind of environment > because you get treated as an artist but you get treated as a friend first. > They're a lot easier to deal with and they're a lot more understanding and > there is no doubt in my mind that they will continue to push us a hundred > percent. In November 2011, Hilltop Hoods premiered the single, \\"I Love It\\", on the Triple J breakfast show. Featuring Sia, the song peaked at No. 6 on the ARIA chart and was the lead single from their sixth album, Drinking from the Sun, which was released on 9 March 2012. Drinking from the Sun became their third number-one album in Australia and also charted on the New Zealand top 40 album chart. In January 2012, Fontana‚Äîan independent marketing, sales and distribution company that is based within the corporate structure of the Universal Music Group‚Äîsigned an exclusive agreement with Golden Era Records for the American release of Drinking from the Sun and the label's back catalogue titles. Following their win at the 2012 ARIA Awards ceremony, the Hilltop Hoods mentioned the release and title of their seventh album, '‚ÄòWalking Under Stars‚Äô', in a Facebook post, suggesting that it would emerge in late 2013; however, an album was not released during this period. On 25 January 2013, the label announced the signing of another artist on the Golden Era Facebook fan page‚ÄîK21, an Adelaide, Australia artist discovered through the Hilltop Hoods' \\"Initiative\\" programme was welcomed to Golden Era with the statement, \\"Welcome to the squad K21!!\\". However, no further official public notification, such as a press release, was published. In late January/early February 2013, K21's artist profile was added to the label's website and he is described as \\"a powerful weapon for years to come\\". The Golden Era roster performed in a music video collaboration, entitled \\"Cypher\\", that was published on the label's YouTube channel on 24 January 2013. Set to the music of \\"Bloody Poetry\\" by Grieves (produced by Budo), the video features the entire Golden Era artist roster‚ÄîFunkoars, Vents, Hilltop Hoods, Adfu, K21 and Briggs‚Äîand was directed/filmed by Unity Sound and Visual. Together with the announcements that were published on the Internet, the video introduces K21 to Golden Era Records, with the artist delivering the concluding verse. In April 2013, K21 released his first recording with Golden Era, the free EP Kid Sinatra. The EP was uploaded onto the Golden Era Soundcloud page and, as of 11 April 2013, is available as a free download (together with the cover art) on the Acclaim Magazine website. A music video for the opening song \\"Long Time\\" was published on the Golden Era YouTube channel and the video, filmed at Disk Edits and DJ Debris's Take Away Studios, was filmed by Eightlimb Films and edited by K21. Also in April 2013, the Hilltop Hoods stated that the development of Walking Under Stars was ‚Äúwell underway‚Äù, with the trio calling the album Drinking from the Sun \\"part two\\"‚Äîthe latter received a double platinum sales certification in the same month. Additionally, American clothing company Zoo York announced a partnership with the Hilltop Hoods in April 2013, in preparation for the brand's 20th anniversary celebrations in 2014. By September 2013, a release date for Walking Under Stars was not announced and a minor indication of the album's status was included in an Australian media article on the sale of band member Daniel Smith (Pressure)'s Adelaide home in the Flagstaff Hill area. The September article simply stated that Smith was \\"currently writing\\" for the album and, as of April 2014, further news had not been published. ===2014‚Äìpresent: Dawn Of The Head EP, Sheplife, Walking Under Stars=== The Funkoars released the Dawn Of The Head EP in February 2014 to build momentum for the release of their fifth studio album, In Case of Emergency. In an interview in March 2014, Sesta explained that the forthcoming album \\"is like an aggressive foot rub from your neighbour, you‚Äôre kinda familiar with how it‚Äôs going to go down, but the closeness of it makes everyone a bit uncomfortable.\\" However, Sesta did not confirm a release date for the album, stating: > Things have never felt better in the Oars camp, not just at home in the > studio, but the last few tours we have done it has been really cool getting > to meet all the people who come to our shows, both veteran fans and a stack > of people who only know us from our last album. There always seems to be a > real positive vibe at our shows, which has got us super keen to finish more > music and just get back out there touring. After its Australian release on 8 August 2014, Walking Under Stars debuted in the number-one position of the ARIA album charts during the week beginning 11 August 2014, providing the Hilltop Hoods with their fourth chart-topping album since The Hard Road in April 2006. As of 16 August 2014, the Hilltop Hoods have garnered a total of six weeks at the top of the ARIA charts from four number-one albums, three of which are Golden Era Records releases. The label was invited by Rolling Stone Australia magazine to curate the inaugural \\"Live Lounge\\" event, held in Melbourne, Australia, on 29 September 2014. Apart from the Hilltop Hoods, who were touring in North America at the time, the entire Golden Era roster performed at the event. \\"Change My Way\\", the first single from K21's debut Golden Era album, Any Given D-Day, was published as a streamable audio file on the Rolling Stone Australia website on 3 October 2014. The accompanying text said that the album will be released on Golden Era Records \\"towards the end of the year [2014]\\". Suffa was responsible for the production of the single and it also features Joy Sparkes. During the \\"Cosby Sweater\\" Australian tour, Suffa explained in a television interview that K21 is the \\"whole package\\", due to his proficient capacity in all aspects of hip hop music production. ==Golden Era mixtapes== The label released its first ever \\"mixtape\\", entitled Golden Era Mixtape 2011, on 17 January 2011, as a free download‚Äîit contains musical contributions from Hilltop Hoods, Funkoars, Briggs and Vents.

He is the son of renowned painter Martiros Saryan and the grandson of the prominent writer Ghazaros Aghayan. Musically gifted, Ghazaros attended the Yerevan State Conservatory from 1934 to 1938, where he studied composition with Sargis Barkhudaryan and Vardges Talyan. Afterwards, he travelled to Moscow and enrolled in the composition class of Vissarion Shebalin at the Gnessin State Musical College. With the outbreak of World War II in 1941, Ghazaros was drafted into the Soviet army and served actively until 1945. Subsequently, he entered the Moscow Conservatory. Among his composition teachers were Dmitri Kabalevsky, Dmitri Shostakovich and Anatoly Nikolayevich Alexandrov. Saryan graduated in 1950.Soviet Armenian Encyclopedia, vol 10, p 238. Upon his return to Armenia, Saryan joined the faculty of the Yerevan Komitas State Conservatory where he taught orchestration. During 1955-56, he was chairman of the Armenian Composers' Union. In 1960, he was appointed rector of the Conservatory, a position he retained until 1986. Saryan taught composition as well, training such Armenian composers as Tigran Mansurian, Rober Altunyan, Vardan Adjemyan and Ruben Sargsyan. Ghazaros Saryan was essentially a composer of symphonic oeuvre. He also wrote works for chamber music, as well as several film scores. Saryan received many awards, including the People's Artist of the Armenian SSR (1983) and the People's Artist of the USSR (1991). For his military service he was decorated with the Red Star Medal. Saryan's Armenia: Symphonic Panels was performed in 1991 at the Pierre Boulez Contemporary Music Center in Metz, France, and his Passacaglia was presented in 1995 during the Athens Music Festival. Ghazaros Saryan's manuscripts are deposited at the Martiros Saryan Museum, in Yerevan, Armenia. ==CompositionsOrchestra=== *Symphonic Poem, 1950 *Symphonic Images, 1956 *’Ä’°’∂’§’´’Ω’°’æ’∏÷Ä ’∂’°’≠’•÷Ä’£’°’∂÷Ñ [Festive Overture], 1957 *Adagio and Dance, string orch, 1957 *Serenade, 1959 *Armenia: Symphonic Panels on motifs by Martiros Saryan, 1966 *Vn Concerto, 1972 *Symphony, 1980 *Choreographic Composition, 1987 *Passacaglia, 1994 *Fanfares, 1996 *Andante and Presto, vn, chm orch, 1997 ===Vocal=== *’ç’∏’æ’•’ø’°’Ø’°’∂ ’Ä’°’µ’°’Ω’ø’°’∂ [Soviet Armenia], vocal soloists and chorus, 1950 *‘µ÷Ä’£ ’≠’°’≤’°’≤’∏÷Ç’©’µ’°’∂ [Peace Song], voice, pf, 1951 *‘Ω’°’≤’°’≤’∏÷Ç’©’µ’°’∂ ÷Ö÷Ä’® [Day of Peace] (vocal-symphonic suite), chorus and orch, 1953 *’î’•’¶ ’•’¥ ’•÷Ä’£’∏÷Ç’¥, ’Ä’°’µ÷Ä’•’∂’´÷Ñ [Fatherland, I Am Singing of You], voice, pf, 1955 ===Instrumental=== *Theme with Variations, pf, 1947 *Sonata no. 1, vc, pf, 1948 *String Quartet no. 1, 1949 *Dance, pf, 1955 *Concert Piece, trp, pf, 1962 *Aria and Toccata, vn, pf, 1966 *’ä’°’∫’´’Ø’´ ’™’°’¥’°÷Å’∏÷Ç’µ÷Å’® [Grandfather's Clock], pf, 1970 *String Quartet no. 2, 1986 *Sonata no. 2, vc, pf, 1989 *3 Postludes, pf, 1990 ===Romances=== *‘ª’∂’π’∏÷Ç’û ’∏÷Ç’∑’°÷Å’°÷Ä [Why Are You Late?], 1956 *’Ä’´’∂’£ ÷Ñ’∂’°÷Ä’°’Ø’°’∂ ’•÷Ä’£’•÷Ä [Five Lyrical Songs], 1960 ===Film Scores=== *’ì’•’Ω’°’ø’•’Ω [Visiting the Groom], 1953 *’Ñ’°’∂÷Ä’∏÷Ç’∂÷Ñ [Small Change], 1954 *’Ä’∏’æ’°’¶’°’±’∏÷Ä’´ ’£’•÷Ä’´’∂’•÷Ä’® [The Captives of Hovazadzor], 1956 *‘±’º’°’ª’´’∂ ’Ω’´÷Ä’∏ ’•÷Ä’£’® [The Song of First Love] (composed with Arno Babadjanian), 1958 *01-99, 1959 *’Ü÷Ä’° ’•÷Ä’°’¶’°’∂÷Ñ’® [Her Fantasy], 1959 *’Ñ’•÷Ä ’©’°’≤’´ ’±’°’µ’∂’•÷Ä’® [The Voices of Our Neighborhood], 1960 *’Ñ’°÷Ä’ø’´÷Ä’∏’Ω ’ç’°÷Ä’µ’°’∂ [Martiros Saryan], 1965 *‘±÷Ä÷á’°’µ’´’∂ ’£’∏÷Ç’µ’∂’•÷Ä’´ ’¥’•’≤’•’§’´’∂ [Melodies of Sunshine], 1979 ==ReferencesFurther reading=== ‘±÷Ä’°÷Ñ’Ω’´ ’ç’°÷Ä’µ’°’∂, ’Ç’°’¶’°÷Ä’∏’Ω ’ç’°÷Ä’µ’°’∂’® ’•’æ ’∂÷Ä’° ’™’°’¥’°’∂’°’Ø’®, –ê—Ä–∞–∫—Å–∏ –°–∞—Ä—å—è–Ω, –õ–∞–∑–∞—Ä—å –°–∞—Ä—å—è–Ω –∏ –ï–≥–æ –í—Ä–µ–º—è. ¬´‘±÷Ä’≥’•’∑¬ª ’∞÷Ä’°’ø’°÷Ä’°’Ø’π’∏÷Ç’©’µ’∏÷Ç’∂, Yerevan 2001. ==Recordings== *http://cdbaby.com/cd/lazarsaryan (Chamber Music) *http://cdbaby.com/cd/lazarsaryan2 (Symphonic Music) ==External links== *Lazar Saryan (in Russian) * Category:1920 births Category:1998 deaths Category:People from Rostov-on-Don Category:Armenian composers Category:Soviet composers Category:Soviet male composers Category:People's Artists of the USSR Category:Armenian academics Category:People's Artists of Armenia Category:Russian Armenians Category:Komitas State Conservatory of Yerevan alumni Category:Gnessin School of Music alumni Category:Moscow Conservatory alumni Category:Komitas State Conservatory of Yerevan faculty Category:Armenian people of World War II Category:Soviet military personnel of World War II Category:20th-century classical musicians Category:20th-century composers Category:20th-century male musicians ","title":"Ghazaros Saryan"},{"id":"19303007","text":"Your Own Back Yard is a 1925 American short silent comedy film directed by Robert F.

C. Knights and F. R. Leavis, who remained its principal editor until the final issue in 1953. Other editors included D. W. Harding and Harold Andrew Mason. An additional volume, number 20, is often included in this series, including \\"A Retrospect\\" by Leavis, indexes, and errata. ==Background== Literary critic and historian Boris Ford has stated that it was L. C. Knights \\"who had the idea of creating such a literary quarterly, and took steps to bring it into being on 15 May 1932 - Knights's 26th birthday. Knights was the only one of Scrutiny's editors who served in that role for every one of its 76 issues.\\"The Independent, 15 March 1997. The first issue appeared early in May 1932, with 100 copies sold in the first week, with subscribers including T.S. Eliot, George Santayana, R. H. Tawney and Aldous Huxley. The circulation rose slowly, with 750 copies being printed later in the 1930s, and 1000 copies in the 1940s. At its height in the 1950s, Scrutiny only printed 1,500 copies, but most of these were held by colleges and academic libraries for circulation. As such, Scrutiny was widely read, and Leavis became very influential in 20th century literary criticism in part because he was editor of the journal. After writing many articles for the journal, music critic Wilfrid Mellers appeared on the editorial board of the January 1942 issue, and continued in that position until the December 1948 issue. Besides its editorial staff, Scrutiny was able to have a contributing body of many important literary critics, including: Q.D. Leavis, Marius Bewley, William Empson, L.C. Knights, Michael Oakeshott, Herbert Read, I. A. Richards, George Santayana, Derek A. Traversi, and Martin Turnell. Some of the contributors to Scrutiny were also contributors to Left Review. Many contributors focused on the topics of education and politics, but, according to Richard Poirier, \\"its most important achievement was a nearly complete revaluation of English literature\\". That is not to say that they always supported these critics; according to John Grant, Scrutiny denounced \\"the later work of Empson and Richards\\" and disregarded \\"critics in the colonies such as Blackmur, Burke, and Frye\\". ==Critical response== Poirier claims that \\"Scrutiny had earned more respect and more denunciation than any other quarterly in English\\". Grant, in responding to Poirier's review of Scrutiny, found that \\"Scrutiny specialized in being right‚Äîhalf the time. In order to praise, it felt compelled also to damn, and then found it easy to do so because it possessed \\"standards\\" against which all works could be judged.\\" There were other detractors, including T. S. Eliot; \\"'I so strongly disagreed with Dr Leavis during the last days of [Scrutiny],' Eliot wrote, 'and objected to his attacks and innuendoes about people I knew and respected. I think it is a pity he became so intemperate in his views and was extravagant in his admirations, as I had, in the earlier stages of the magazine, felt great sympathy for its editor.'\\" == Collections == Articles from Scrutiny have been separately republished in collections. *. *. ** Review: == References Further reading== * * ** Review: ==External links== * Scrutiny: Wilfrid Mellers' early writings * Digital files of 77 issues of Scrutiny containing 1,044 articles from 1932 to 1953 and the 1963 Retrospective are hosted by The UNZ Review.

The PLA was founded in 2002, in the midst of the Nepal Civil War initiated by the Maoists in 1996. The chief commander of the PLA during the war was Prachanda (Pushpa Kamal Dahal). On September 12, 2008, Nanda Kishor Pun was appointed new chief commander of the PLA, as Prachanda had become Prime Minister of Nepal. This move was in line with a pledge issued by the CPN(M), issued prior to the 2008 Constituent Assembly election, that their members elected to the Assembly would leave their PLA positions.Nepali Times Xinhuanet Following the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the PLA soldiers stay in cantonments. The CPA stipulates that PLA and the Royal Nepal Army should be integrated. The government of Dahal claims the PLA-NA integrations will be completed by six months.Kantipuronline ==Change of military tactics== After the negotiations with the Government of the king broke down, CPN(M) decided to change their strategy. Meanwhile, Maoist senior leader C.P. Gajurel was arrested on August 20, 2003, at Chennai International Airport. In January and February, 2004 CPN(M) suffered a big setback and lost more than 80 armies attacking different regions of Nepal. There was pressure from the international side, the human rights organization for the brutal killings and kidnappings of civil countrymen during the insurgency. Issuing a press statement on March 16, 2004, Chairman Prachanda said, \\"Our party has been committed to the fundamental norms of human rights and the Geneva convention since the start of the people‚Äôs war. Anyone who without prejudice judges the facts of the eight years can find our People‚Äôs Liberation Army has been showing respectful behaviour, treatment to the injured and releasing the prisoners of the war in good condition.\\" During this period the party changed its military tactics, strategic offence. The PLA was immediately instructed to converge at Thawang in Rolpa to prepare for a major offensive. The foremost responsibility was provided to the Western Command of the PLA. The People's Liberation Army from the brigades at Mangalsen, Gorahi-Satbaria, Lise-Gam and Basu Memorial were in Thawang by 8 March. All the PLA men were introduced with the war strategy and instructed for a major attack, the one in the last years of history of the people's war. The responsibility of executing the plan was entitled to Diwakar, a senior Maoist leader which was believed to be worked out by chairman Prachanda. Between March 8 and 11, PLA commanders Diwakar and Pasang (current commander-in-chief of PLA) built sand models to illustrate the war strategy. On March 12, the armed forces began moving towards the east with nearly about 3000 combatants. With a heavy preparation of arms, lodging, medicine, the PLA was into their destination. From Rolpa, the PLA made their way to Baglung through Rukum. Commander Pasang was in regular contact with the chairman Prachanda. Before reaching Beni, the headquarters of Myagdi district, the PLA was given a final briefing about the war operation. The PLA attacked at 11 pm, March 20. The battle lasted throughout the night till 10 am, the next day. The Royal Nepal Army claimed the killing of about 500 Maoist combatants. But opposing the claim, a statement released by Comrade Biplav claimed the killing of about 120 RNA and 26 policemen. 33 people include RNA soldiers, policemen and CDO with Deputy Superintendent of Police was taken prisoners by the PLA. CPN(M) proposed the releasing of their senior leaders Matrika Yadav, Suresh Ale Magar, Tilak Sharma, and others on account of releasing the prisoners. Chairman Prachanda vowed to continue the people's war. He highlighted the attack of PLA to the army barracks. Describing that the attack as a successful operation, chairman Prachanda claimed that it had blown away the myths about the RNA being trained with foreign forces was invincible. ==Size== According to UNMIN, the PLA has around 19,600 confirmed fighters residing in different cantonments over the past 3 years. The ones who were found to be unqualified during the verification process have been removed from the cantonments recently under an agreement of UNMIN (United Nations Mission in Nepal) personnel, the Nepalese government and the party. ==Legal provision for PLA, Nepal== #As per the commitments expressed in the joint letter sent to the UN by the Government of Nepal and CPN(M) on August 9, the PLA would remain in the temporary camps. The United Nations would monitor and verify them. #All arms and munitions would be securely stored in the camps except those needed for providing security of the camp after the PLA are in cantonments. #Once the PLA are in the camps, the Government of Nepal will take responsibility of providing ration and other facilities to them. #The interim cabinet will form a special committee to carry out monitoring, integration and rehabilitation of the Maoist insurgents. #Efforts will be made to make arrangements for the security of the Maoist leaders as per the agreement with the government of Nepal.nepalitimes ==Barrier in the integration== The Nepali Maoist party's ambitious plan to fuse its People's Liberation Army with the latter's arch-enemy, the Nepal Army, has come unstuck yet again with the opposition party refusing to toe the former rebels' line. Prime Minister Prachanda, who till two months ago was also the supreme commander of the guerrilla People's Liberation Army, had announced that a special committee would be formed to begin the controversial reintegration process. However, the panel could not be formed as the opposition, former Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala's Nepali Congress, raised dissent against the meeting of four major parties shooting down the Maoist proposal that the committee should be headed by a Maoist representative. NC leaders have also begun protests against what they say is a move by the Maoists to appoint Nanda Kishor Pun 'Pasang', the chief of PLA after Prachanda stepped down, as the chief of the re-shuffled army. Due to the infighting among the two biggest parties, Prachanda, for the second time Thursday, put off the scheduled cabinet meeting that was to have announced the formation of the committee. More homework and parleys among the parties need to be done, the embattled Maoist chief told the news media. The merger of the PLA with the Nepal Army remains one of the biggest blocks in the ongoing peace process in Nepal. Over 15,000 PLA fighters are leading a grim life in cantonments for nearly two years, hoping for eventual state recognition by being included in the state army. The merger was a key condition of the peace pact signed by the Maoists in 2006, which paved the way for their relinquishing [arms and the restoration of peace in insurgency- racked Nepal. The NC, which was the ruling party in 2006, had agreed to the condition. Now, however, smarting under a poll defeat, it has begun opposing the integration, saying the PLA was politically motivated that could not be trusted to be non-partisan. The army is also opposing the merger. The army chief, Gen. Rukmangud Katawal, has said that the army would accept only those who met international recruitment norms. The Nepalese army showed a disagreement to the Maoist proposal since long back when this issue of the merger was put forward. CPN(M) clearly denies a complete peace process without the integration of the two forces and creating a ‚Äònew‚Äô national army. The integration process was started in November 2011.Subedi, DB.

In the early 1960s he began studying philosophy at the Free University of Berlin. Afterwards he worked as editor of lexica, as copywriter and editor for publishing houses. In the 1970s he started translating texts, initially focusing on non-fiction. ===Tolkien literature=== He gained a greater readership by his translation of J. R. R. Tolkien's book The Silmarillion. In the 1990s he retranslated The Hobbit; compared to the earlier translation by Walter Scherf, who had left out or shortened most of the poems and songs embedded into the plot, and which moreover contained illustrations by children's books illustrator Klaus Ensikat, Krege's version rather appeals to a more grown-up readership. Another difference is made by a lack of adherence to the original: Krege has a tendency to write a funnier and fancier book than the original Hobbit. Thereby various sentences are interpreted in a way which cannot any more be regarded as translation but is clearly new script. Additionally, Krege's version features a number of modern words like \\"Hurricane\\" which can easily be seen atypical for the medievally and European inspired Middle-earth (although Tolkien's original as well does contain words like \\"football\\" or \\"express train\\"). Krege's translation of place names though is closer to the original script. Where \\"Rivendell\\" remained untranslated by Scherf, Krege used Bruchtal and standardised the place names according to the German translation of The Lord of the Rings by Margaret Carroux and E.-M. von Freymann (Klett-Cotta 1969/1970). He also eradicated earlier misinterpretations of English \\"Elf\\" to German \\"Fee\\" (fairy), where Tolkien explicitly wished to distinguish his elves from the diminutive airy-winged fairies.Tolkien, J.R.R. (1964). ‚ÄúOn Fairy-Stories‚Äù. Tree and Leaf. George Allen and Unwin Ltd. Reprinted in Tolkien, J.R.R. (1966). The Tolkien Reader. Ballantine Books: New York Krege's retranslation of The Lord of the Rings (Ger.: Der Herr der Ringe) is highly disputed among fans. The new German interpretation of 2002 tries stronger than the old Carroux version to reflect the different style of speech employed by the various characters in the book. In the old German translation the speech is quite uniform throughout the plot ‚Äì moderately old-fashioned and according to some critics even artificially folksy. The English original though features various layers of speech, from a 16th-century Bible style to the rustic and urban, sometimes gross, common British English of the 1940s, i.e. the time of its being written. Krege tries to imitate this in German, but used the German language of the 1990s as a reference rather than the 1940s. For example, he translated Samwise Gamgee's often-employed phrase \\"Master Frodo\\" to \\"Chef\\" (German (and French): boss; not to be confused with English \\"master cook\\") - a term which many fans of classic fantasy literature in German-speaking countries think of as totally improper. In Wolfgang Krege's translation, the appendices to The Lord of the Rings are for the first time completely translated to German, save for one part. ===Other translations=== Krege wrote also an (equally disputed) retranslation of Anthony Burgess' A Clockwork Orange as well as other works by Burgess. In addition, Krege was the standard translator to German for works by Am√©lie Nothomb. ==Selected worksAs an author=== * Begriffe der Gruppendynamik (Terms of Group Dynamics), Konzepte der Humanwissenschaften, Stuttgart 1977 () * Handbuch der Weisen von Mittelerde (Handbook of Middle-earth Scholars), Stuttgart 2001 () * Elbisches W√∂rterbuch Quenya und Sindarin.

Between 1970 and 1980 he won all his major international competitions, except for the 1970 and 1974 European championships where he placed second. Yarygin was an Olympic champion in 1972 and 1976, being the first wrestler to go through an Olympic competition with straight pin victories and no foul points, a world champion in 1973, a World Cup winner five times, has never lost a single match in World Cup competition, and a European champion in 1972 and 1975‚Äì76, and won a world cup in 1973, 1976‚Äì77 and 1979‚Äì80. He also set a record for the fastest pin victory in the World Cup history at 27 seconds.The record later was beaten by Jim Jackson, who pinned Japanese heavyweight Yasuori Ominato in 17 seconds, April 1, 1978. See: After retiring in 1980, he headed the Soviet freestyle wrestling team from 1982 to 1992 and the Russian Wrestling Federation from 1993 until his untimely death in a car crash in 1997. An exceptional upper-body wrestler, Yarygin was widely regarded for his tremendous physique and high-strength aggressive style, always aiming to pin down his opponents, with most of his stoppage wins came by way of fall achieved through rapid fireman's lift and slamming the opponent to the mat. One of the most prestigious tournaments in the World was put together in his honor - The Golden Grand Prix Ivan Yarygin Tournament is held annually in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, and has the reputation of being one hardest tournaments in the World. The Yarygin Memorial annually sees the world's best wrestlers come to Siberia, with the added element that Russia's autonomous oblasts and republics such as Dagestan and Chechnya field independent teams alongside an All-Russia selection. ==BiographyChildhood and early career=== Yarygin was born as the sixth child in a family of ten siblings. Most members of his family were heavily built and physically active people. Since early age Yarygin helped his father at his blacksmith workshop. As a teenager he wanted to become a football goalkeeper, and took up wrestling only in 1966, aged 18. He then was drafted and went on to win the Soviet Armed Forces heavyweight championships in Sambo wrestling, gaining the Master of Sports degree in Sambo. He then switched to freestyle wrestling, and won 1968 RSFSR national youth championships and 1969 Soviet youth championships. ===Prime years=== In 1970 he won the Soviet title competing in senior division, beating his main rival Vladimir Gulyutkin; he lost to Gulyutkin in 1971, but beat him again at the 1972 Olympic Trials and was selected for the Munich Olympics. At the Olympics he won all five bouts by fall, spending on the mat a little more than 7 minutes instead of 45. Three months prior to the Olympics, he won the 1972 European Championships, winning all bouts by fall. When first appeared in the United States for the 1973 World Cup and the subsequent wrestling tour, the U.S.‚ÄîSoviet Olympic freestyle wrestling exhibition, where he and the USSR National Wrestling Team met the United States National Team (composed of both National AAU, Athletes in Action and NCAA Wrestling Team Championship winners,) the American press described him as \\"a blue-eyed, red-haired, 24-year-old wrestler from the Soviet Union who spreads 220 pounds over an awesome, statuesque frame that might have been hammered and chiseled out of a granite block cornerstone from the Tomb of Lenin.\\" He was a flagbearer for the Soviet wrestling team while on the U.S. tour. When Yarygin wrestled Russell Hellickson (whom he had his shoulder disclocated at their previous match-up at the Olympics,) at Hellickson's hometown of Madison, Wisconsin, Yarygin let him up to prevent further injury, and wrestled just hard enough to protect himself until Hellickson finally fainted to pain. After the Olympics, he won the 1973 World Championships, again all bouts by fall. Thus Yarygin became the only wrestler to win three consecutive major competitions, scoring only fall victories. He then lost several minor contests, and decided to retire from competition, settled in his native village of Sizaya, where he worked as a lumberjack in Taiga forest. Outdoor activity helped him to regain his strength and confidence, and he came back in 1974 to continue his victorious streak. His next Olympic victory in 1976 was less spectacular because he wrestled the whole tournament with two broken ribs. After that Yarygin was selected as the Soviet Olympic flag bearer at the closing ceremony. Coming to the Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania for the match-up versus the American National Wrestling Team, Soviet wrestlers were welcomed officially by Mayor Walter Lisman, and were given a key to Wilkes- Barre by the mayor. ===Wrestling style=Retirement=== While preparing for the Moscow Olympics Yarygin realized that the young Soviet wrestler Ilya Mate has a better chance for the gold medal (which he indeed won). Yarygin retired from competition permanently in 1980 and became a wrestling coach. In 1982‚Äì92, he trained the Soviet freestyle wrestling team, and in 1993‚Äì1997 headed the Russian Wrestling Federation. He was a key organizer of the 1997 World Wrestling Championships in Krasnoyarsk. ==International competition record== - ! style=background:white colspan=8 International competition record (incomplete)Details of Ivan Yarygin profile available at the United World Wrestling Database. - !

It was the subject of an investigation by Walter Hubbell, an actor with an interest in psychic phenomena, who kept what he claimed was a diary of events in the house, later expanded into a popular book. ==Events== The Amherst Mystery centred on Esther Cox, who lived in a house with her married sister Olive Teed, Olive's husband Daniel and their two young children. A brother and sister of Esther and Olive also lived in the house, as did Daniel's brother John Teed. According to Hubbell's account, events began at the end of August 1878, after Esther Cox, then aged 18, was subjected to an attempted sexual assault by a male friend. This left her in great distress, and shortly after this the physical phenomena began. There were knockings, bangings and rustlings in the night, and Esther herself began to suffer seizures in which her body visibly swelled and she was feverish and chilled by turns. Then objects in the house took flight. The frightened family called in a doctor. During his visit, bedclothes moved, scratching noises were heard and the words \\"Esther Cox, you are mine to kill\\" appeared on the wall by the head of Esther's bed. The following day the doctor administered sedatives to Esther to calm her and help her sleep, whereupon more noises and flying objects manifested themselves. Attempts to communicate with the \\"spirit\\" resulted in tapped responses to questions. Walter Hubbell The phenomena continued for some months, and became well known locally. Visitors to the cottage, including clergymen, heard banging and knocking and witnessed moving objects, often when Esther herself was under close observation. In December Esther fell ill with diphtheria. No phenomena were observed during the two weeks she spent in bed, nor during the time she spent recuperating afterwards at the home of a married sister in Sackville, New Brunswick. However, when she returned to Amherst the mysterious events began again, this time involving the outbreak of fires in various places in the house. Esther herself now claimed to see the \\"ghost\\", which threatened to burn the house down unless she left. In January 1879 Esther moved in with another local family, but the manifestations around her continued and were witnessed by many people, some of whom conversed with the \\"ghost\\" by questioning and rapped answers. Some were curious and sympathetic; others believed Esther herself to be responsible for the phenomena, and she met with some hostility locally. Esther was frequently slapped, pricked and scratched by the \\"ghost\\", and on one occasion was stabbed in the back with a clasp knife. Interest in the case grew as the news spread, and in late March Esther spent some time in Saint John, New Brunswick, where she was investigated by some local gentlemen with an interest in science. By now, several distinct \\"spirits\\" were apparently associated with Esther and communicating with onlookers via knocks and rappings. \\"Bob Nickle\\", the original \\"ghost\\", claimed to have been a shoemaker in life, and others identified themselves as \\"Peter Cox\\", a relative of Esther's, and \\"Maggie Fisher\\". After the visit to Saint John, Esther spent some time with the Van Amberghs, friends with a peaceful farm near Amherst and then returned to the Teeds' cottage in the summer of 1879, whereupon the phenomena broke out again. It was at this point that Walter Hubbell arrived, attracted by the publicity surrounding the case, and moved into the Teed cottage as a lodger to investigate the phenomena. Hubbell spent some weeks with Esther and her family, and reported having personally witnessed moving objects, fires and items appearing from nowhere and claimed that he saw phenomena occur even when Esther herself was in full view and obviously unconnected with them.Hubbell, chapter V He also claimed to have witnessed attacks on Esther with pins and other sharp objects, and to have seen her in several of her fits of extreme swelling and pain. He communicated with the various named \\"spirits\\" by rapping, and listed three others: \\"Mary Fisher\\", \\"Jane Nickle\\" and \\"Eliza McNeal\\", who were also manifesting themselves as part of events. With Hubbell's professional help, Esther Cox embarked on a speaking tour, attracting audiences who paid to see her and hear her story. However, she met with some hostile reactions and, after she was heckled one night and a disturbance broke out, the attempt was abandoned. She returned to Amherst once more, working for a man named Arthur Davison, but after his barn burned down he accused her of arson and she was convicted and sentenced to four months in prison, although she was released after only one. After this, the phenomena gradually ceased for good. Esther Cox subsequently married twice, having a son by each of her husbands. She moved to Brockton, Massachusetts with her second husband and died on 8 November 1912, aged 52. ==Aftermath== Hubbell's book was published in 1879 and proved popular, selling at least 55,000 copies. The Amherst case was also investigated by the British paranormal researcher Hereward Carrington, who took statements from surviving witnesses of the events in 1907 and published them, along with a detailed account of the case, in 1913. Other researchers looked at the case more critically than Hubbell: in particular, Dr. Walter F. Prince in the Proceedings of the American Society for Psychical Research (Vol XIII, 1919) made a detailed case for trickery by Esther Cox while in a dissociative state.Larsen, Egon. (1966). The Deceivers: Lives of the Great Imposters. Roy Publishers. pp. 130-132 In 2012, former Cumberland County Museum Curator Laurie Glenn Norris authored a book further investigating the mystery entitled Haunted Girl: Esther Cox and the Great Amherst Mystery. In 2015, the book's publisher announced that it had sold the film rights for the book to a project led by Larysa Kondracki, a director of popular TV shows such as The Walking Dead and Better Call Saul. In 2019, the mystery was featured on the Dark Poutine podcast, which explores true crime and dark history. It has been suggested that certain aspects of the alleged paranormal events at Borley Rectory, sometimes dubbed \\"the most haunted house in England,\\" may be linked to the Amherst case. The experiences of the Foyster family there in the early 1930s ‚Äì in particular claims that writing appeared mysteriously on the wall ‚Äì resemble events in the Teed household. Rev. Foyster had previously lived at Sackville, New Brunswick and may well have been aware of the case of Esther Cox. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Hereward Carrington. (1913).

Most of the slang are common across all dialects. However certain slang are restricted to certain social classes or groups. Sinhalese is an Indo-Aryan language and exhibits a marked diglossia between the spoken and written forms. As such, it is also difficult to find instances of colloquial slang in any form of formal literature. Also certain slang (specially sexual slang and swear words) are considered to be so taboo that definitions of those words are not found in any public domain literature. If you take a language such as English, most of its profanity has gotten less taboo over time. If you take USA or UK for example, most English profanities are broadcast uncensored on cable channels like HBO. This is not the case with Sinhalese profanities. They are not found in any form of media, publications; not even popular websites show them, apart from unmoderated blogs and talk pages. Having said that, most of the non-taboo slang given as examples below are in widespread and frequent use even in popular media - especially in various FM radio channels and popular TV channels. ==Swear words and vulgarities== Each dialect and within each dialect; regional, class, age and gender differences would lead to unique slang, vulgarisms, profanities and swear words. Following is a list of potential slang by different categories as of 2007. Certain slang carry covert prestige and are used only within certain social groups and thus not often understood outside of that group. For example, ƒÄyis AmmƒÅ (‡∂Ü‡∂∫‡∑í‡∑É‡∑ä ‡∂Ö‡∂∏‡∑ä‡∂∏‡∑è) is a slang term used by certain parts of Sri Lankan society to express pleasurable surprise (similar to wow!). This slang is not picked up by most of the social classes who may regard themselves as \\"more refined\\". Instead these people might use ShƒÅ (‡∑Ç‡∑è) to express the same feeling. Within Sri Lankan universities, diverse slang exists, which is only used and understood by the university students and the alumni. For example Kuppiy…ô (‡∂ö‡∑î‡∂¥‡∑ä‡∂¥‡∑í‡∂∫) which literally means 'small bottle' or 'small lamp' is used to refer to an informal tuition class conducted by a student, who better knows the subject area for a small study group for free of charge. Within the Army, the term ƒÄti (‡∂Ü‡∂ß‡∑í) is used to refer to artillery shells so that ƒÄti gahan…ôvƒÅ (‡∂Ü‡∂ß‡∑í ‡∂ú‡∑Ñ‡∂±‡∑Ä‡∑è) means shelling. These terms such as Kuppiy…ô (‡∂ö‡∑î‡∂¥‡∑ä‡∂¥‡∑í‡∂∫) and ƒÄti (‡∂Ü‡∂ß‡∑í) are mostly not understood outside of the demographic group that uses them. ===Use of (kƒÅr…ôyƒÅ)=== Sinhalese has an all-purpose suffix (kƒÅr…ôyƒÅ) which when suffixed to a regular noun (which denotes a demographic group, etc.), creates an informal and (sometimes) disrespectful reference to a person of that demographic group. Most native speakers of Sinhalese liberally use this suffix when they chat informally. However they also make great effort to avoid kƒÅr…ôyƒÅ when they speak in a formal venue. e.g. polis-kƒÅr…ôyƒÅ (‡∂¥‡∑ú‡∂Ω‡∑í‡∑É‡∑ä‡∂ö‡∑è‡∂ª‡∂∫‡∑è) ‚Äì policeman th√¶p√¶l-kƒÅr…ôyƒÅ (‡∂≠‡∑ê‡∂¥‡∑ê‡∂Ω‡∑ä‡∂ö‡∑è‡∂ª‡∂∫‡∑è) ‚Äì postman mura-kƒÅr…ôyƒÅ (‡∂∏‡∑î‡∂ª‡∂ö‡∑è‡∂ª‡∂∫‡∑è) - watchman √¶merikan-kƒÅr…ôyƒÅ (‡∂á‡∂∏‡∑ô‡∂ª‡∑í‡∂ö‡∂±‡∑ä‡∂ö‡∑è‡∂ª‡∂∫‡∑è) - an American ===Use of (thuma)=== Sinhalese has an all-purpose odd suffix (thuma) which when suffixed to a pronoun creates a formal and respectful tone in reference to a person. Most native speakers of Sinhalese rarely use this suffix in conversation due to its nascency. e.g. Mama-Thuma (‡∂∏‡∂∏‡∂≠‡∑î‡∂∏‡∑è) - (Formal) Myself Blasphemy Buddhism being the primary religious tradition in Sinhalese culture, blasphemy in the Sinhalese language primarily refers to Buddhism. However, there exists only a very few instances of Sinhalese slang which can be categorised as blasphemy on Buddhism. Similarly the term \\"GanayƒÅ\\" (‡∂ú‡∂´‡∂∫‡∑è) is blasphemous; it is a very disrespectful reference to a Buddhist Monk. The term \\"Rahath UnƒÅ\\"(‡∂ª‡∑Ñ‡∂≠‡∑ä ‡∂ã‡∂±‡∑è) can also be treated as blasphemy, due to the fact that the religious term \\"attaining arahath (enlightened) state\\" is used here to mean something non-religious and mundane. The slang \\"'Rahath UnƒÅ'\\" usually refers to the situation where someone sneaks out from somewhere, without telling anyone. This slang, however is well accepted in the mainstream diglossia, unlike other blasphemy terms discussed above. \\"Erdhi UnƒÅ\\"(‡∂ë‡∂ª‡∑ä‡∂Ø‡∑í ‡∂ã‡∂±‡∑è) is a similar term which can be treated as blasphemy on the same grounds. The term \\"(Himin S√¶rƒì) MƒÅru UnƒÅ\\" ((‡∑Ñ‡∑í‡∂∏‡∑í‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∑É‡∑ê‡∂ª‡∑ö) ‡∂∏‡∑è‡∂ª‡∑î ‡∂ã‡∂±‡∑è) gives the same meaning without blasphemy. ===Equating people with animals=== For the purpose of swearing (for fun, and as nicknames), it is a common practice in many languages/cultures to equate people with animals; and Sinhalese is no exception. Most languages/cultures have a popular set of such animals references used for this purpose. Each animal represents a particular set of characteristics which can be positive or negative. Referencing people with the word for a \\"dirty\\" animal like a pig has negative connotation; likewise, a reference to a strong animal like \\"lion\\" has a positive one. Cow or bull (\\"GonƒÅ\\"[‡∂ú‡∑ú‡∂±‡∑è]/\\"HarakƒÅ\\"[‡∑Ñ‡∂ª‡∂ö‡∑è]) is an animal reference frequently used in Sinhala. For example, \\"Gon V√¶dak\\" (‡∂ú‡∑ú‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∑Ä‡∑ê‡∂©‡∂ö‡∑ä) means a \\"stupid deed\\". ===Taboo sexual slang and Euphemisms=== Most of the sexual slang, euphemisms and sexual innuendo in Sinhalese discourse has a strong male perspective. Irreverence and disrespect is a common trait in sexual slang (due to its very nature of being \\"sexual\\"). Some of the slang can be offensive to both genders, but in general, more sexual slang is used to refer to females than males. An otherwise well- meaning Sri Lankan male may resort to sexual slang when describing a situation of sexual nature to his peers, and that does not necessarily indicate that he has any disrespectful intent. This type of sexual slang ranges from \\"mild\\" to \\"severe\\" and sometimes borders the \\"extreme taboo\\". It is advisable to avoid slang of this nature in decent company. ===Sexual profanity=== Sexual profanity in Sinhalese is regarded highly taboo in Sinhalese speaking society, and are not supposed to be written down in any form, in any venue. These terms are collectively called (ku·πáu harupa) in Sinhalese which literally means 'dirty/rotten utterings'. It is difficult and nearly impossible to find references to Sinhalese profanity. Definitions of such are not found in any public domain literature in the Internet or outside of Internet, apart from occasional un-moderated talk page or a blog in the internet, or graffiti and scribbles found in public toilets. ==See also== * Neologism ==Further reading== * Disanayaka, J.B, 1998, Understanding the Sinhalese, * Gair, J.

In 1930, the privately held Tsugaru Railway began operations on the western side of Tsugaru Peninsula, and surveying work was completed by the Japanese Government Railways (JGR) to build a government-operated line on the eastern side of Tsugaru Peninsula. These plans were postponed by the outbreak of World War II, and were only resumed in the 1950s under the Japanese National Railways (JNR). On December 5, 1951, the first segment of the Tsugaru Line was completed from to . This was extended by October 21, 1958 to the present northern terminus at . Additional intermediate stations were added in 1959 and 1960. All scheduled freight operations were suspended on December 10, 1984. With the privatization of the JNR on April 1, 1987, the line came under the operational control of JR East. From March 13, 1988, the tracks between Aomori Station and the Shin Naka-Oguni Signal are jointly used by JR East, JR Hokkaido's Tsugaru-Kaiky≈ç Line and Japan Freight Railway Company (JR Freight). In 1988 the Aomori - Shin Naka-Oguni section was electrified in conjunction with the opening of the Seikan Tunnel and associated Tsugaru-Kaiky≈ç Line. ==See also== * List of railway lines in Japan ==References== This article incorporates material from the corresponding article in the Japanese Wikipedia. * Harris, Ken and Clarke, Jackie.

His family initially lived there on social benefits until his father found work. Rod completed his Abitur (school-leaving exams) at the Gymnasium Langenhorn. Rod has an older sister, Claudia, who also works as a musician (Universal Gonz√°lez). As a teenager, Gonz√°lez was a member of the band Die Erben. From 1986 to 1988 he played banjo in the Hamburg punk band Die Goldenen Zitronen, and from 1988 to 1989 he was the guitarist in the Rainbirds. ===Career with Depp Jones and Die √Ñrzte=== Gonz√°lez became friends with the Die √Ñrzte drummer, Bela B., when they sang a Kiss song together in a bar while drunk. Gonz√°lez was also a member of the so-called ‚ÄòKISS Army‚Äô. Bela B. quickly began to value Rodrigo Gonz√°lez' musical talent. They played together in the band S.U.M.P., which later changed its name to Depp Jones, following the (temporary) break-up of Die √Ñrzte in 1988. After failing to achieve commercial success, Depp Jones split up in 1992. When Die √Ñrzte got back together in 1993, Gonz√°lez became their new band member. Although he had been the guitarist in Depp Jones, he became the bassist in Die √Ñrzte. While the last Die √Ñrzte bassist prior to the break-up, Hagen Liebing, had only been a hired band member, Gonz√°lez has been a full-fledged member of Die √Ñrzte since joining the band. He has penned the Die √Ñrzte singles 1/2 Lovesong and Dinge von denen, among others. Alongside bass and guitar, Gonz√°lez has also taught himself to play the drums, keyboard and piano. The other members of Die √Ñrzte therefore jokingly refer to him as ‚Äúover-qualified‚Äù. During the MTV Unplugged concert Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll Realschule, which took place in 2002 in the Albert- Schweitzer-Gymnasium in Hamburg, Gonz√°lez was the musical director and arranger for most of the songs performed. ===Other musical projects=== Rodrigo Gonz√°lez works as a producer for various bands and other artists, such as Lucilectric, Knorkator and Panda. He is also the co-owner of Rodrec, a record company, through which both of the Depp Jones albums were re-released and to which the artists Rantanplan, Church Of Confidence und Abw√§rts are signed. Rod has also played guitar with Abw√§rts since 2004. During the live concert Fu√üballfans gegen Rechts (meaning football fans against right-wing extremism) on 30 January 1993 in the Zakk Club, D√ºsseldorf, Gonz√°lez played in the punk band Slime as a stand-in. He covered the Kiss song I'll Fight Hell to Hold You in 2001, turning it into a disco track and singing in the Bee Gees style. In 2005 Gonz√°lez and Bela B. (as Zwei Fickende Hunde) recorded the song Meister aller Fotzen by Die Kassierer for the CD Kunst to celebrate 20 years of the Wattenscheid punk band. ==ReferencesRod Army (only available in German) * RodRec record label (only available in German) Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Chilean male singers Category:Chilean rock singers Category:People from Valpara√≠so Category:Musicians from Hamburg Category:Chilean emigrants to Germany ","title":"Rodrigo Andr√©s Gonz√°lez Esp√≠ndola"},{"id":"19303707","text":"George Treby may refer to: *Sir George Treby (judge) (1643‚Äì1700), British judge and Member of Parliament *George Treby (politician) (1684‚Äì1742), British politician and Secretary at War, eldest son of the above *George Treby (younger) (c.1726‚Äì1761), MP for Plympton Erle, son of the above *George Hele Treby (c.1727‚Äì1763), MP for Plympton Erle, younger brother of the above *George Treby (British Army officer) (168c. 5‚Äì?), British Army officer and politician ","title":"George Treby"},{"id":"19303717","text":"A furrow is Furrow may also refer to: * The Furrow, an Irish Roman Catholic theological periodical * Furrows (film), a 1951 Spanish film ==People with the surname== * Buford O.

He previously served as an assistant coach for the Philadelphia Eagles and Carolina Panthers. ==Early years== Born in Omaha, Nebraska, McDermott later grew up in Pennsylvania. His family lived in West Chester and Paoli before settling in Lansdale when McDermott was in second grade. McDermott first attended North Penn High School before transferring to La Salle College High School, where he was named All-Southeastern Pennsylvania at defensive back in 1992 and graduated in 1993. He was also a national prep champion wrestler in 1992 and 1993. He received a bachelor's degree in finance while at the College of William and Mary, where he was an all-conference safety (1997). He was teammates with Mike Tomlin, who was a wide receiver and faced McDermott constantly.https://billswire.usatoday.com/2019/12/15/buffalo-bills-pittsburgh- steelers-mike-tomlin-sean-mcdermott/ He also received Academic all-conference honors in 1996 and 1997 and NSCA Strength and Conditioning All-America accolades. ==Coaching careerPhiladelphia Eagles=== McDermott originally joined the Philadelphia Eagles in 1998 as a scouting administrative coordinator, a position he held until being promoted to assistant to the head coach in 1999. He then became defensive quality control coach and later assistant defensive backs coach. In 2003, he replaced Steve Spagnuolo as defensive backs coach, as Spagnuolo was assigned linebackers coach. In 2004, McDermott saw both of his starting safeties (Brian Dawkins and Michael Lewis) earn Pro Bowl berths for the first time in team history. McDermott and the Eagles appeared in Super Bowl XXXIX that season but had lost to the New England Patriots who had won their 2nd straight Super Bowl title. Under McDermott's watch, Dawkins went on to earn two more Pro Bowl berths following the 2005 and 2006 seasons. In 2007, McDermott was assigned linebackers coach, after Spagnuolo had left to take the defensive coordinator job for the New York Giants. On January 28, 2008, Eagles head coach Andy Reid named McDermott as the secondary coach again. On May 18, 2009, McDermott was named the interim defensive coordinator as a result of defensive coordinator Jim Johnson's medical leave of absence. On July 24, of that same year, due to the continuing decline of Johnson, the Eagles announced McDermott would take over as full- time defensive coordinator. Johnson died four days later. McDermott implemented a variety of blitzes in his defense, thanks in part to his mentor, former Eagles defensive coordinator Jim Johnson. McDermott was fired as the defensive coordinator on January 15, 2011. ===Carolina Panthers=== McDermott was hired as the defensive coordinator of the Carolina Panthers on January 17, 2011. He was Pro Football Focus's second runner up to their Defensive Coordinator of the Year award in 2015. As the Panthers' defensive coordinator, McDermott led the team to finishes in the top ten in overall defense from 2012‚Äì2015. In the 2015 season, McDermott and the Panthers reached Super Bowl 50, which was played on February 7, 2016. His defense only gave up one offensive touchdown in the game, but the Panthers fell to the Denver Broncos by a score of 24‚Äì10. ===Buffalo Bills=== On January 11, 2017, McDermott was hired by the Buffalo Bills as the 22nd head coach in franchise history. On September 10, 2017, McDermott won his NFL head coaching debut in the season opening 21‚Äì12 victory over the New York Jets, becoming just the third Bills head coach to win his first game with the team after Marv Levy and Rex Ryan. After Buffalo lost in Week 2 to the Carolina Panthers, McDermott led the Bills to 4 more wins in the next 5 games, including a win against the reigning NFC champion Atlanta Falcons. However, they lost the next two games, including a 47‚Äì10 loss to the New Orleans Saints, which prompted him to make the controversial decision to bench starting quarterback Tyrod Taylor in favor of rookie backup Nathan Peterman. Peterman played poorly against the Los Angeles Chargers in his first career start, throwing 5 interceptions in the first half. He was benched for Taylor during the second half of the 54‚Äì24 loss, which dropped the Bills to 5‚Äì5. Despite the string of losses, the Bills then went on a 4‚Äì2 run to finish the season at 9‚Äì7, clinching the AFC's 6th seed and their first playoff appearance in 18 years, thus ending both the NFL's and the North American professional sports franchise's longest active playoff droughts during McDermott's first year as head coach. The Bills would go on to lose to the Jacksonville Jaguars 10‚Äì3 in the AFC Wild Card Game. The following season, McDermott's Bills finished 6‚Äì10 and missed the playoffs, but had a strong finish to the season after a 2‚Äì7 start. After suffering blowout losses in four of the first nine games, partly caused by a lack of offensive talent, the Bills adjusted their roster, allowing them to stay competitive in each of the last seven games. Buffalo's defense improved in 2018. McDermott was nominated for NFL Head Coach of the Year for the 2019 season after leading the Bills to a 10-6 record, receiving their second playoff berth in three seasons as the AFC's #5 seed. The Bills would lose 22-19 to the Houston Texans in overtime during the Wild Card round. On August 12, 2020, McDermott signed a contract extension through 2025. ==Head coaching record== {  style=\\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Team !! rowspan=\\"2\\"Year !! colspan=\\"5\\"Regular season !! colspan=\\"4\\"Postseason - !Won !!

During his legal studies at the University of St. Petersburg, Dmitriy discovered the writings of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin and joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Party. After serving a prison term, he openly ceased all anti-Tsarist activity and received a position with the Department of State Properties at the Ministry of Agriculture. == Conversion == In 1913, Dmitriy purchased a copy of the New Testament from a woman peddling the scriptures on a train from Tambov to St. Petersburg. \\"I did it,\\" he wrote, \\"partly out of compassion and partly out of snobbery.\\" When his mother later put his briefcase in order, she was overjoyed to see his latest purchase.

It is also known officially as Carlos P. Garcia Avenue, and as National Route 11 (N11), National Route 128 (N128), National Route 129 (N129), and National Route 128 (N141) in the National Route Numbering System implemented in 2014. Expressway portions, part of the North Luzon Expressway Mindanao Avenue and Karuhatan Links, are designated components of Expressway 5 (E5). The road serves as a beltway around Metro Manila, spanning some as it transverses through the cities of Valenzuela, Quezon City, Pasig, Makati, Taguig, Pasay, Para√±aque, and Las Pi√±as. It runs parallel to the four other beltways around Metro Manila, and is also known for being the second most important transportation corridor, after Circumferential Road 4, better known as EDSA. The road is not yet complete to date, because of certain controversies regarding right of way, but portions of the road are already open for public use. On July 23, 2019, the two segments of the road has been connected together with the completion of the C-5 South Link Expressway, through a flyover over the Skyway and SLEX, in 2019. ==Route description== The C-5 road lies parallel to other circumferential roads around Metro Manila, most notably Epifanio de los Santos Avenue of C-4, passing through the cities of Valenzuela, Quezon City, Pasig, Makati, Taguig, Pasay, Para√±aque, and Las Pi√±as. The road is divided into segments. ===NLEX Karuhatan Link=== From MacArthur Highway in Karuhatan, Valenzuela to Smart Connect Interchange, a cloverleaf interchange with the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX), C-5 is known as NLEX Karuhatan Link, also named as NLEX Segment 9. It is also the first segment of the NLEX Harbor Link project, which connects NLEX with Port of Manila. The entire toll road is designated as part of a C-5 Road. ===NLEX Mindanao Avenue Link=== From the Smart Connect Interchange to a 3-way signalized junction with Mindanao Avenue, C-5 is known as NLEX Mindanao Avenue Link or NLEX Segment 8.1. The entire toll road is designated as part of a C-5 Road. ===Mindanao Avenue=== Mindanao Avenue in Barangay Tandang Sora, Quezon City At the eastern end of NLEX Mindanao Avenue Link, C-5 turns southeast and becomes Mindanao Avenue. With the entire avenue spanning , it is a 10-lane divided carriageway that serves as the main transportation corridor of Barangays Talipapa and Tandang Sora in Quezon City. The portion of this road from NLEX Mindanao Avenue Link to Congressional Avenue is designated as a portion of the C-5 Road. ===Congressional Avenue=== At the signaled junction with Mindanao Avenue, C-5 turns northeast as the Congressional Avenue, a 6-lane divided carriageway that serves as the main east to west transportation corridor of Barangays Bahay Toro, Culiat, Pasong Tamo, and Tandang Sora in Quezon City. It then continues east for up to Luzon Avenue. ===Luzon Avenue=== Luzon Avenue Flyover At the end of Congressional Avenue Extension, C-5 turns south as Luzon Avenue, a 4-lane divided city road between Barangays Culiat and Matandang Balara in Quezon City, for up to Commonwealth Avenue. The 6-lane Luzon Avenue Flyover carries C-5 across Commonwealth Avenue to connect it with Tandang Sora Avenue. ===Tandang Sora Avenue=== Southeast of Commonwealth Avenue, C-5 is known as Tandang Sora Avenue. It runs for from Barangay Matandang Balara, going around the University of the Philippines Diliman campus, up to the junction with Magsaysay Avenue. The original planned route of C-5 included the entire road; however, due to the incapacity of the road to carry a large amount of vehicular traffic, only the portion of the road from the Luzon Avenue Flyover to Magsaysay Avenue was designated as a portion of C-5 Road. Furthermore, Tandang Sora Avenue becomes a 6-lane divided carriageway shortly after crossing Capitol Hills Drive, south of the flyover. ===Katipunan Avenue=== Katipunan Avenue After crossing Magsaysay Avenue, C-5 turns south and becomes Katipunan Avenue, a 10-lane divided carriageway that serves as the main transportation corridor of Matandang Balara, Pansol, Loyola Heights, and Project 4 in Quezon City. It heads south for until its junction with Bonny Serrano Avenue. Shortly before crossing Bonny Serrano Avenue, a 4-lane divided underpass descends from Katipunan Avenue and traverses underneath Col. Bonny Serrano Avenue and ascends into Libis Flyover, which immediately connects it to E. Rodriguez Jr. Avenue. ===Bonny Serrano Avenue=== C-5 then turns east as Col. Bonny Serrano Avenue, 4-lane undivided avenue, for from Katipunan Avenue to Eulogio Rodriguez Jr. Avenue. A four-lane divided underpass descends from Katipunan Avenue and traverses underneath Col. Bonny Serrano Avenue as Libis Underpass and ascends into Libis Flyover, which immediately connects it to E. Rodriguez Jr. Avenue. ===Eulogio Rodriguez Jr. Avenue=== Eulogio Rodriguez Jr. Avenue At its junction with Bonny Serrano Avenue, C-5 then turns south as Eulogio Rodriguez Jr. Avenue, a , 10-lane divided road that serves as the main thoroughfare between Quezon City and Pasig. The entire road, from Katipunan Avenue to Pasig Boulevard is designated as a portion of C-5 Road. The road ends in a junction with Pasig Boulevard and continues onto Bagong Ilog Bridge that crosses the Pasig River and eventually becomes Carlos P. Garcia Avenue shortly afterwards. The avenue is named after Eulogio Rodriguez, Jr., a former representative and governor of Rizal. ===Carlos P. Garcia Avenue=== Past the Bagong Ilog Bridge over the Pasig River, C-5 comes Carlos P. Garcia Avenue. It is a , 14-lane divided road that serves as the main thoroughfare between Pasig and Pasay, passing a small portion in Makati and continuously passing Taguig. It then meets the exit ramps to the C-5 South Link Expressway and South Luzon Expressway, before ending at the intersection with East Service Road. ===C-5 Road Extension=== Across South Luzon Expressway, C-5 continues as C-5 Road Extension from West Service Road near Merville Exit in Pasay to Manila‚ÄìCavite Expressway in Las Pi√±as, traversing south of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport and through Para√±aque. ==History== The unfinished northern section of the C-5 Kalayaan elevated U-turn slot in March 2009, about two months before its completion. The proposal for the Metro Manila Arterial Road System was done in the late 1960s. The proposal states of building 10 Radial Roads and 6 Circumferential Roads to support the growing vehicular population of the Metropolitan Manila. The 5th Circumferential Road began construction in 1986. Under the power of Republic Act 8224, which was passed on November 6, 1996, the C-5 road was legally known as President Carlos P. Garcia Avenue, honoring the eighth president of the Republic of the Philippines, Carlos P. Garcia. ===Extensions=== On July 23, 2007, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo announced on her State of the Nation Address that C-5 Road will be extended to the north of Metro Manila, from North Luzon Expressway in Quezon City to Navotas and will be extended in the south from South Luzon Expressway in Taguig-Para√±aque boundary to Coastal Road in Las Pi√±as in the southern part of Ninoy Aquino International Airport. As of June 2010, the NLEx Mindanao Avenue Link (Segment 8.1) in Valenzuela City and Congressional Avenue Extension from Tandang Sora to Luzon Avenues in Quezon City have been opened to all motorists in the North Extension. SLEx-Sucat Link or Carlos P. Garcia Avenue Extension in the South Extension located in Para√±aque were also opened. As of March 2015, the NLEX Karuhatan Link (Segment 9) has been opened to all motorists. The opening of the Segment 9 from NLEx to MacArthur Highway in Karuhatan, Valenzuela served as a preparation for the Holy Week season. At present, the New Luzon Avenue Flyover connecting Tandang Sora and Luzon Avenues across Commonwealth Avenue was opened to all motorists. Prior to the opening of the flyover, the Congressional Avenue Extension from Visayas to Luzon Avenue was opened in 2010 to decongest heavy traffic in Visayas-Tandang Sora Avenue Intersection. ==FutureC5 Southlink Expressway=== The C5 Southlink Expressway, or the CAVITEX - C-5 Link Expressway, is a toll expressway that will connect Manila- Cavite Expressway (CAVITEX) with the main route of C-5 in Taguig. The project costs at (), and is a joint project of the Philippine Reclamation Authority, Toll Regulatory Board, and CAVITEX Infrastructure, Inc. The expressway is built in two phases, with the first phase that fills the gap between the C-5 main route and the C-5 Extension in Merville by constructing a flyover over SLEX and Skyway, and the second phase involving construction of the Merville- CAVITEX segment. Construction of the new expressway started on May 8, 2016. Phase 1 was opened to traffic on July 23, 2019 and completion of the project is expected in 2021. ===C-5 Expressway=== NLEX Corporation (formerly Manila North Tollways Corporation) and CAVITEX Infrastructure Inc., submitted a proposal for C-5 Expressway, a fully elevated expressway that will further decongest the existing C-5 and provide a fully controlled-access route between CAVITEX-C5 South Link and NLEX Segment 8.2. The proposed expressway will utilize portions of the existing C-5 right of way between SLEX and Pasig Boulevard, and run above Marikina River from Pasig Boulevard to Luzon Avenue. ==Controversy== The Senate of the Philippines investigated the South Extension where it passes many of Sen. Manny Villar's properties such as Camella. The original C5 South Extension was called MCTEP, and was already approved by the Senate. MCTEP was a road that would be made as a toll expressway and resurrected as CAVITEX-C5 Link. ==Location on the West Valley Fault== Studies by the PHIVOLCS reveal that a large portion of the C-5 road is built on top of the West Valley Fault. A map of the fault line released on May 18, 2015 shows the C-5 road in Taguig beside the fault line. The C-5 road is prone to liquefaction. ==LandmarksBusiness Districts and Commercial Areas=== *Bonifacio Global City (Taguig) **McKinley Hill **Market!

The attack came at the same time as American and international troops was fighting Taliban and al-Qaeda militants close by in neighboring Afghanistan. The upsurge in strikes alarmed Pakistani military and government officials, who said it seriously undermined their counter-insurgency operations.

Previously Koroma played for Swedish Superettan club Varbergs BoIS and the Sierra Leone national football team. He plays both as a defensive midfielder and central defender. Koroma is commonly known by his nickname \\"Marcel\\", which is taken from former French footballer Marcel Desailly. ==CareerFC Kallon=== Born in Freetown, Sierra Leone, Koroma played for Sierra Leone National Premier League side FC Kallon until 2008. He scored 13 goals in 83 caps during his four-year stay at the club. Koroma also helped FC Kallon win the Sierra Leonean FA Cup in 2007 as well as reach the first round of the CAF Champions League in that same year. ===D.C. United=== American Major League Soccer club D.C. United signed Koroma in September 2008. However, he was waived at the end of the season as D.C. United failed to buy out his transfer rights from FC Kallon. This was caused by the roster changes in MLS from 28 to 24 players which meant that Koroma was surplus to requirement since they wanted to use their funds to give development contracts to SuperDraft players for the 2009 Major League Soccer season. ===Motala AIF=== At the start of the 2009 season Koroma was brought in on loan by Swedish third tier club Motala AIF. Even though the club was relegated at the end of the season Koroma returned again for the first half of the following year where he vas voted best defender of all six fourth tier leagues. ===Trelleborg=== After his success at Motala he was signed by Allsvenskan club Trelleborgs FF in July 2010. During his time at the club Trelleborg suffered two consecutive relegations and found themselves in the third tier at the start of 2013. This caused Koroma to declare that he wanted to leave the club. ===Varbergs BoIS=== In February 2013 Koroma was signed by Superettan club Varbergs BoIS. ==International career== Koroma represented Sierra Leone as part of the U-17, U-20 and U-23 National Teams, before making his senior team debut in 2007. Since then, he has represented his country on 14 occasions and was selected to play for the National Team in its CAF Cup of Nations and 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign, playing as a starter in Sierra Leone's matches against Nigeria, South Africa and Equatorial Guinea.

It was built for Leeds Corporation between 1853 and 1858 The architecture of Leeds, a city and metropolitan borough in West Yorkshire, England, encompasses a wide range of architectural styles and notable buildings. As with most northern industrial centres, much of Leeds' prominent architecture is of the Victorian era. However, the City of Leeds also contains buildings from as early as the Middle Ages such as Kirkstall Abbey, one of Britain's best preserved ruined Cistercian monasteries, as well as examples of 20th century industrial architecture, particularly in the districts of Hunslet and Holbeck. Most of the current buildings in Leeds are the product of the Industrial Revolution and post war regeneration in the 20th century, as many new buildings were provided in the city's commuter towns and villages to house the increasing suburban population. Leeds city centre is currently undergoing much redevelopment, with a number of skyscrapers such as Bridgewater Place. Many buildings in Leeds have won awards for their architecture: examples are the renovation projects for the Corn Exchange and the Henry Moore Institute, which have won RIBA awards. ==Materials of construction== The Nook, Oulton LS26 Before modern times, buildings were usually constructed of local materials, including wood, thatch etc. The Nook in Oulton (dated 1611) is a rare example of an original half-timbered house. Of the more durable materials, there are three rocks which have been substantially used. These are gritstone (a sort of sandstone) found to the north and west (e.g. Kirkstall Abbey, Leeds Town Hall or Harewood House), different sandstones in the Yorkshire Coal Measures, and limestone to the north and east, as is shown in older villages (now suburbs) in these directions. To the south of the city are substantial clay deposits, so that red brick has been the predominant building material for the extensive nineteenth century housing. The particularly fine clay found in Burmantofts led to a decorative covering of terracotta or glazed Architectural Faience being used on both interior and exterior walls of important buildings. In the twentieth century, new building methods, particularly concrete and steel were used, and the exterior was essentially facing. Thus materials from further away could be used, such as the Portland Stone used on the Leeds Civic Hall, the Parkinson Building of the University of Leeds and the Queens Hotel. ==Pre 1600== Adel Church The earliest evidence of civilisation in the area of Leeds is at Seacroft and dates to 3500 BC. The oldest existent man-made structure in the Leeds metropolitan district is the earthworks of the Iron Age fort at Barwick in Elmet. Leeds is thought to have been the site of the Roman town of Cambodunum, abandoned when the Romans left Britain in around 400 AD. The first church in Leeds is thought to have been built around 600 AD. Leeds, like many industrial cities, has little remaining medieval architecture. The lack of Medieval architecture in central Leeds may be attributed to the small size of the town during the majority of the period, the population usually being around 1,000. At the time there were several larger settlements in Yorkshire such as Wakefield and York. The Church of St John the Baptist at Adel is one of the earliest remaining buildings in Leeds. It was built of gritstone with slate roofs between 1150 and 1170. It has been described as \\"one of the best and most complete Norman village churches in Yorkshire\\". Kirkstall Abbey Kirkstall Abbey is the most noteworthy piece of architecture from this period in Leeds. The abbey, which is a Cistercian foundation, was begun on the banks of the River Aire in 1152. The abbey was disbanded and the buildings ruined during the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII. Although Cistercian abbeys were numerous in England, many were located in remote areas and, unlike several Benedictine and Augustinian abbeys, did not survive the Dissolution by being reused as parish churches. At Kirkstall Abbey, the ruins are particularly well preserved and show an austere form of Norman architecture with some later Gothic additions and embellishments. The remnants of most of the monastic buildings are sufficiently intact to display the domestic arrangement and function of the monastery. The Abbey House Museum keeps records and displays artefacts from the abbey as well as from other eras across Leeds. Paintings of the Abbey have come from artists as renowned as J. M. W. Turner and Thomas Girtin. In 1889 the abbey was purchased by Colonel John North and presented to Leeds City Council. The council restored parts of the abbey and made it safe for public enjoyment before opening it in 1895. Although central Leeds has few buildings from the Middle Ages, there are examples within the City of Leeds boundaries, including two at Wetherby. Wetherby Bridge dates from the Medieval period, but has been considerably altered, the pointed Gothic arches of different heights being replaced by semi-circular arches. It is said that the Bishop of York granted absolution of sins to local residents in return for building the bridge. The building of a castle was commenced in Wetherby in 1140, but it was demolished in 1155, because it was the King had not granted permission for its construction. The remains of its foundations can still be seen, and it is remembered in the street name \\"Castle Gate\\". Harewood Castle is a 14th-century stone hall house and courtyard fortress, in the grounds of Harewood House. It is a Grade I listed and is currently undergoing conservation. ==1600 to 1800== Lambert's Yard, the oldest building in the city centre By Tudor times, Leeds had become a market town of about 3,000 people, which grew to about 6,000 by the mid-17th century, however successive redevelopments of the city centre in the following centuries have destroyed almost all visible evidence of this period. The earliest building remaining in the city centre is a late 16th- or early 17th- century house in Lambert's Yard, off Briggate. It is a timber framed building with a gable and three jettied storeys, \\"possibly the cross-wing of a larger hall house\\". It is in a state of disrepair and is not generally accessible to the public. St John's church in c.1919 The church of St John the Evangelist, New Briggate, is the oldest church in central Leeds, consecrated in 1634. It was founded by John Harrison. It is described as \\"something of an architectural rarity: a virtually intact 17th century church\\". In 1865 there were plans to demolish it, but Norman Shaw came to its defence and argued successfully for its restoration. Its interior is unusual in having two naves, and it has a large amount of Jacobean woodwork. It is no longer used for regular services but is in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust and is regularly open for visitors and also used for occasional public events. Harewood House A major example of 18th century architecture lies just outside the city (although within the City of Leeds boundaries) in the Grade I listed Harewood House. This was built between 1759 and 1771 and funded from the proceeds of the West Indian Slave Trade. The architect was John Carr of York, with extensions by Robert Adam who also designed the interiors. The opening of a trade hall in Wetherby in 1710 brought about further industrial development, most of this was still on a small scale until the 19th century, but Leeds like Manchester began to show growing industrialisation before many other towns and cities across the industrial belts of Yorkshire and Lancashire did, providing Leeds with a few rare examples of industry from before the period that is generally accepted as the beginning of the industrial revolution (late 18th century) had begun. Armley Mills was built in 1788 and is currently the largest woollen mill museum. There are several examples of industrial architecture from the latter part of this era in Holbeck, Hunslet, Armley and areas surrounding Leeds city centre. The Granary Buildings date from the same period. The main infirmary was originally on Infirmary Street (near City Square and Quebec Street). Designed by John Carr, it was built in 1768‚Äì1771 and demolished in 1893 to make way for the Yorkshire Penny Bank. Holy Trinity Church on Boar Lane was constructed between 1721 and 1727, built to a design by William Etty. It is a Grade I listed building. The building has not changed much (although a new steeple was built in 1839 by R D Chantrell), but developments such as the Burton Arcade and the Leeds Shopping Plaza have been built so close that it is difficult to see the full exterior of the building as was once possible. In 2007 it was reported in the Yorkshire Evening Post that the remains of a 17th-century cottage in Alwoodley had been demolished after controversial approval from Leeds City Council. ==Nineteenth century== The Vicar Lane entrance to Leeds Kirkgate Market Leeds Corn Exchange It was in the 19th century that Leeds began to grow into one of Britain's largest cities. This led to widespread building across the city. Leeds' wool and cloth trades resulted in the building of many industrial buildings during this era. The resulting workforce which migrated to the city from rural areas brought about the building of many houses. Leeds has perhaps the most surviving examples of back-to-back terrace housing in the UK, particularly in Holbeck and Harehills. Headingley Castle, also known for a good deal of the 19th century as The Elms, was designed in about 1841 on land that had been owned by Barbara Marshall. It was built between 1843 and 1846 by the local architect John Child for the corn merchant Thomas England. The estate was originally 22 acres. While the exterior of Headingley Castle is Victorian Gothic in style, the architect employed modern building techniques and materials including cast iron in its construction. Leeds city centre has many examples from this era, such as Leeds Town Hall, the Leeds Kirkgate Market, the Hotel Metropole, the Leeds City Varieties, the Central Post Office, Calls Landings and the Corn Exchange to name a few. Leeds Town Hall (pictured top) was designed by Cuthbert Brodrick and was opened by Queen Victoria in 1858. The Hotel Metropole was built in the 1890s and was inspired by French architecture of the time. The Leeds Corn Exchange was also designed by Cuthbert Brodrick and was built between 1861 and 1864. The building lay derelict for many years until 1985 when it was converted into a shopping centre. Harehills, Burley, Holbeck, Chapeltown, Woodhouse and East End Park contain many houses from this era, while Cross Gates has a column guided gasholder from this era. The 19th century saw the construction of most of Leeds' railway infrastructure, including architecturally notable viaducts in Holbeck and Leeds city centre. None of the major railway stations from this era have survived, in fact most of Leeds railway station was rebuilt as recently as 2002. As well as industrial architecture Hunslet has a history for some notable churches. The main steeple on Church Lane was once part of a large church. All but the steeple were demolished in the 1970s and a smaller church building attached. Meadow Lane in Hunslet was also home to Christ Church, an architecturally notable Gothic church, which has since been demolished. Leeds Parish Church was constructed in 1841 and at tall it held the record as Leeds' tallest building until the building of the town hall in 1858. ===Housing=== 1800s through terraced houses in Harehills. Back to back houses in Autumn Place, Burley Leeds' growth in the 19th century led to mass migration to the city; this resulted in many areas of the city becoming overcrowded and many new houses being built. The industrial revolution led to the increase in both working and middle classes, leading to the building of many new houses, aimed at both classes. The most common form of housing to be built for the working classes was the 'back to back'. Back to back terrace houses were built in the largely working class districts of Harehills, Holbeck, Hunslet, Beeston and Armley, whilst larger through terrace houses were built for the middle classes in Headingley and Kirkstall. Chapeltown developed as an affluent district of Leeds, and boasts many large Victorian villas, however the popularity of outer suburbs such as Roundhay towards the late 20th century brought land values down in Chapeltown and the area fell into decline. In 1830 the cost of building a small back to back house in Leeds was between seventy and eighty pounds. The average weekly rent was between two and four shillings, which was about a fifth of the average wages at the time. ==Twentieth century== Hyde Park Picture House Millennium Square Poulson's Leeds International Swimming Pool, opened in 1966, demolished 2009 Parkinson Building at the University of Leeds Quarry Hill is often cited as an example of poor architecture, and is nicknamed 'The Kremlin' or 'The Ministry of Truth' Leeds has a wide variety of buildings from this era. Chapel Allerton has many art deco semi detached houses from the 1930s while large parts of the city centre contain many commercial buildings from this era. Seacroft has many examples of 20th century residential architecture. ===Early era=== For the first decade of the 20th century many areas of Leeds saw a continuation of Victorian style architecture, particularly in areas like Beeston. The Hyde Park Picture House, Hyde Park was originally built in 1908 as a hotel and in 1914 it was converted into a picture house. The cinema has gas lighting, the original organ and piano. It is a grade II listed building and one of the few surviving picture palaces in the UK. The picture house is regarded by many to be one of the finest examples of Edwardian architecture in Leeds. ===1920s to 1940s=== Quarry Hill Flats, June 1967 Hunslet Grange (Leek Street) flats, Hunslet, 1973 Fashionable styles and materials in this era brought Portland stone buildings to Leeds. Major examples include Leeds Civic Hall, designed by E. Vincent Harris in 1930 and built between 1930 and 1933 to provide the unemployed with work during the Great Depression, the Queens Hotel on City Square (1937), the Brotherton Wing of Leeds General Infirmary (1940) and the Elinor Lupton Centre, Headingley (1934). The Quarry Hill Estate was designed in 1933 but not completed until 1941 They were designed by Leeds Director of Housing R. A. H. Livett (1898‚Äì1959) and utilised a monolithic modernist design based on European examples, in particular the Karl Marx-Hof in Vienna. This was revolutionary at a time when most mass Council housing was based on a weak Neo-Georgian design. They were demolished throughout the 1970s and 80s after poor maintenance. It provided the backdrop for Yorkshire Television sitcom, Queenie's Castle. The following year, Shaftesbury House, a large five-storey brick hostel for working men and woman opened. It was designed in 1936 by George Clark Robb, senior architectural assistant to Livett, and after its closure, was converted in 2006-7 to the sustainable Green House. ===Art Deco=== Chapel Allerton and to a lesser extent Headingley boast many Art Deco houses. Parts of the Leeds General Infirmary were built in Art Deco style. Chapel Allerton also boasted the former Dominion Cinema, which was built in Art Deco style, however this closed in the late 1960s and became a bingo hall, which was demolished in the 1990s. A Fish and chip shop in Oakwood retains its Art Deco front from the 1930s. ===1960s to 1980s=== Many areas of Leeds such as Seacroft were almost entirely built in this era. There are many high-rise council flats in Leeds as well as office buildings such as West Riding House. Many Victorian slums were demolished during this era and replaced with council housing. There was also widespread private residential developments. Holt Park was a joint effort between the Leeds City Council and Norman Ashton. There were many Ashtons homes built during this time, particularly in Holt Park and Wetherby. West Riding House was completed in 1973 and was the tallest building in Leeds until the completion of Bridgewater Place in 2007. In 2008 it was knocked into third position with the opening of Opal Tower. The Inner Ring Road was constructed over the course of the 1960s. This was the most ambitious scheme of its kind in the UK with Leeds City Council subsequently promoting the city with the slogan Motorway City of the Seventies. The works involved the construction of many flyovers and tunnels and the Motorway construction is notable in itself. Another council plan during the 1960s was to separate pedestrians and traffic, and it was proposed that any new buildings in City Square would be built with an overhead walkway ‚Äì this never came to fruition, with only a short section ever being built. The growth of the financial and business services sector from the mid-1980s onwards resulted in a boom in office developments in the city centre. Many of the buildings constructed at this time are in the style known as the \\"Leeds Look\\", which is typified by the use of dark red brickwork and steeply pitched grey slate roofs. ===Brutalism=== Leeds has limited examples of Brutalism, one such being the Leeds International Swimming Pool (designed by disgraced architect John Poulson). until the commencement of its demolition in Autumn 2009, following its closure in October 2007. The Leeds International Pool was not without its design flaws, the pool size was miscalculated and was less than an inch too narrow to qualify for Olympic Standard meaning that it never held the competitions the council had hoped for and it spent much of the 1960s closed while problems with its construction were rectified. Parts of the Merrion Centre have brutalist undertones, particularly around the office blocks constructed as part of it and the former outdoor escalators to the rear. Hunslet Grange Flats (more commonly known as the Leek Street Flats) displayed brutalism. They replaced run down back to back houses. It is unusual that Leek Street was chosen as their informal name as they replaced many other streets, including longer streets such as Alton Street. The flats were popular at first; however, they were so poorly designed and constructed that in 1983 they were demolished only thirteen years after being constructed. Smaller shops on the site had been demolished even earlier. For a picture of the flats see the Leodis Database:(picture in 1975) and a (picture in 1973). Often unseen parts of the University of Leeds display elements of brutalism, with large areas of exposed concrete. From the A660 however, only older parts of the university are visible. To view these parts of the university it is necessary to walk through the main campus. ===1990s=== The 1990s saw further residential development, such as that around Colton. Schofields Department Store was demolished and replaced by the Schofield Centre (later the Headrow Centre and now The Core) and the White Rose Centre was constructed. The 1990s also saw Tesco redevelop Seacroft town centre, which had previously been architecturally notable for 1960s architecture. Quarry House was constructed on the site of the former Quarry Hill Flats (see 1920s and 1930s) at Quarry Hill. The building houses the Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions and is their main regional offices. The building is controversial. Its imposing design has often been regarded as being domineering and self-important and has led the building to be nicknamed The Kremlin and The Ministry of Truth. ===Housing=== Private housing built by Ashtons in Holt Park Boarded prefabricated housing in Seacroft As in much of the UK, Leeds' housing stock had fallen into disrepair by the middle of the 20th century. The city was overcrowded, and the Victorian terraces were unsuitable for modern inhabitation. Leeds had one of the most Labour orientated councils and in the 1930s pledged to replace 30,000 slums. The older houses relied mainly on heating from open coal fires, which led to problems with smog (in 1962, 24 deaths in Leeds were attributed to this), although this problem was partially relieved in the 1950s with the introduction of the Clean Air Act 1956. Although a slum clearance scheme was under way in the 1930s, it took until after the Second World War, for the scheme to get well under way. In the 1950s, the largest social housing project began with the building of the Seacroft Estate. Seacroft was planned at the time to be a 'Satellite town within the city limits'. The building of new council estates was most prevalent in the city's east end and because of this the city expanded much further East in the latter part of the 20th century then it did any other direction. The Langbar Gardens Estate (completed 1966) in Swarcliffe lay right on the eastern fringes of the city sprawl until it was demolished in the early 21st century, including the high-profile implosions of Langbar Towers, Langbar Grange and Ash Tree Grange. By the 1960s and 1970s land for social housing was becoming scarcer and the council started looking towards building 'high rise', with such estates as Cottingley sporting prominent tower blocks. By the 1970s less land was available for such developments and the particularly large estates were becoming unpopular, however faced with a need for a larger social housing stock, Leeds City Council built smaller estates such as Holt Park (in partnership with Norman Ashton), replaced the prefabricated 'war houses' in Cottingley with newer prefabs and redeveloped areas such as Beckhill in Meanwood. Perhaps the most obvious housing incarnation of this era has been the council house. These have been a subject of some controversy since they were built. On the one hand some people argue they vastly improved Britain's housing stock, and provided their occupants with modern luxuries such as central heating, an inside lavatory and a modern kitchen, while others criticise the way they were built, the disruption to communities, the build quality of certain batches of houses and the policy of housing problem tenants in them. Certain estates in Leeds have suffered from high crime and poverty (such as Seacroft, Gipton, Belle Isle and Halton Moor), Concrete Council-built houses in Seacroft ==Twenty-first century== Bridgewater Place So far during this period, Leeds has seen much development, particularly in the city centre, most notably the highrise developments such as Bridgewater Place, the developments around Clarence Dock, K2 (albeit a conversion from an older building) as well as many developments incorporating student accommodation. The 2002 redevelopment of Leeds railway station incorporated a notable steel and glass roof covering the main platform hall and providing panoramic views to the south west from the mezzanine level. ===Bridgewater Place=== Bridgewater Place is currently the tallest building in Leeds and the second tallest structure in Yorkshire after the Emley Moor Television Transmitter (near Huddersfield). The building comprises offices, flats, shops and restaurants. Bridgewater Place is tall and has 32 storeys. The original design included a spire, but this was never added. In 2008, Building Design, the architectural journal, shortlisted Bridgewater Place for the Carbuncle Cup, which is awarded to 'buildings so ugly they freeze the heart'. ===Plaza Tower=== The Plaza Tower is a skyscraper in the city centre. On completion in 2009, the Plaza overtook Opal 3 as Leeds' second tallest building. The tower contains 572 student flats and stands at . It has 37 storeys (making it the building with the most storeys in Leeds, as the Bridgewater Place has commercial height ceilings. These are particularly high for the first eight storeys). ===Opal 3=== Opal 3 is a skyscraper in Leeds situated to the north of the city centre on Wade Lane, adjacent to the Merrion Centre and Tower House. The building was officially completed in September 2008 and at with 27 storeys Opal 3 is Leeds' third tallest building after Bridgewater Place and Sky Plaza. The building consists solely of student accommodation for the University of Leeds and Leeds Metropolitan University as well as Leeds' other further education institutions. The building was built on the former site of the Little Londoner (later The Londoner) public house, as well as some former car parking in the Lovell Park area of the city. Opal 3 was fully booked for the 2008 academic year. It contains 542 students flats (all which are en-suite) as well as a gym for student use. ===Leeds Dock=== Leeds Dock, looking southeast Leeds Dock was originally a large timber dock, situated between the city centre and Hunslet. Decades of industrial decline left the dock obsolete. The opening of the Royal Armouries Museum in 1996 began the regeneration of the area, however little else was undertaken, until the wider redevelopment began in 2001. This was completed in 2007 (at a cost of ¬£260 million ) and includes flats, offices, bars, restaurants, a hotel and a casino. The development centres on the dock itself as well as around 'Armouries Boulevard' and 'Armouries Square', two pedestrianised thoroughfares. The main office block on the development is Livingston House which has not yet attracted a tenant. The smaller dock incorporates six residential berths for house boats, while a passenger boat service to Granary Wharf runs from here. Knights Way Bridge at Leeds Dock over The River Aire, linking Leeds Dock with the East Bank The development has not been without criticism, with many people in the city commenting on the lack of people in the area, while architect Maxwell Hutchinson described them as the \\"slums of the future\\". and described the development as a \\"mundane collection\\" of buildings and an \\"incredibly soulless place\\" and claimed that \\"in two or three decades these shiny new buildings will be following Quarry Hill down the spiral of decay\\". These claims were explored on the BBC television programme Inside Out. While at a fashion show at Leeds Dock, Gok Wan claimed he thought the development would be a huge success. Leeds Arena under construction in December 2012 ===Leeds Arena=== Leeds Arena is a 13,500 seat 'super-theatre' style venue, the first in the UK to be built in a 'fan' orientation. Construction began in 2011 after decades of calls for a venue to replace the Queens Hall, which was demolished in 1989 and represented the city's only large concert hall. In the intervening period Leeds was the only major city in the UK without such a venue. The building itself is based around a striking honeycomb frontage, modelled on close-up images of an insect's eye, and is illuminated at night in a variety of colours that reflect the mood of whichever show is playing at the time. ==Future== Comparative height of the tallest buildings in Leeds. Two major developments in Leeds city centre were planned for completion around the beginning of the new decade, but were put on hold due to the prevailing economic conditions and subsequently cancelled. These buildings were Criterion Place and Lumiere, both of which would have been the tallest residential buildings in the UK at the time of their completion. A number of investments and proposed activities are aimed at regenerating 253 hectares of land that lies south of the River Aire in Leeds. The regeneration of this area of Leeds, referred to as the South Bank, will be the biggest change the city has seen in more than a hundred years. It currently houses old warehouses and abandoned buildings. Among the projects are plans for Leeds' tallest building. Commercial Estates Group (CEG) are leading a project on patches of land around Globe Road and Water Lane, Holbeck, including a 40-storey, 142 metre tall structure. ==Critical reception on Leeds' architecture== In 1968 John Betjeman made a television film called A Poet Goes North, in which he gave his opinion on the changing architecture of Leeds. Betjeman described the constant sound of falling Victorian architecture. Betjeman also lambasted British Railways House (now City House) saying it blocked all the light out to City Square and was only a testament to money and had no architectural merit of its own. Betjeman also praised Leeds Town Hall in the film. The film, which was never broadcast at the time, was preserved by Leeds Civic Trust and has been restored by the Yorkshire Film Archive. It was screened as part of the Leeds International Film Festival in 2008. Architect and critic Maxwell Hutchinson has attracted controversy in his criticism of recent architectural developments in Leeds, most notably Clarence Dock. In referring to Leeds' plans for the future, Hutchinson said \\"there are worrying signs that Yorkshire is about to make the same mistakes that we have made in London over 20 years ago\\". Hutchinson also criticised the dearth of services in the city centre, referring to its lack of schools and health-care facilities. Hutchinson also described the Clarence Dock development as \\"the slums of the future\\". These claims were explored on the BBC television programme, Inside Out. Hutchinson claimed that Leeds needed an iconic building like Manchester's The Lowry or Gateshead's The Sage. However he claimed that the redevelopment of older buildings around The Calls \\"could compete with anywhere in Europe for the quality and sensitivity of its design.\\" The Guardian architecture critic Owen Hatherley lamented post-millennium architecture in Leeds and bemoaned the weak planning system for allowing a wave of \\"astoundingly cheap-looking architecture\\" in the city. Hatherley points to Sky Plaza as a prime example. ==Public space== Millennium Square Leeds city centre has four main public squares being Park Square, City Square, Armouries Square and Millennium Square. Smaller squares do exist, including Dortmund Square, St Peters Square, Queen Square, Woodhouse Square and Hanover Square. In recent years there have been a number of concerted efforts to add to the public space within the city centre, including the development of Sovereign Square, Granary Wharf, and Bond Court, as well as ambitious plans for a large city centre park on the South Bank. Since 2000, both City Square and Millennium Square have been redeveloped with hard landscaping. In an interview with Martin Wainwright, the northern editor of The Guardian, architect Irena Bauman, praised City Square for being a well designed and well used public space, however she criticised The Plaza Tower development for its lack of public space, stating that the only space made available was for service vehicles. In 2018 Leeds City Council launched its new strategy for improving public spaces in the city centre. This incorporates a number of key projects for development or redesign of new public space, and included a strong consultative element. ==Awards== Many buildings in Leeds have been shortlisted for or won architecture awards. === Council for Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) === Broadcasting Tower, Woodhouse Lane, was voted the best tall building in Europe in June 2010 by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, and went on to be voted the best tall building in the world in October 2010, fending off competition from the Burj Khalifa. ===RIBA=== The following buildings have a RIBA award: *The Corn Exchange *The Henry Moore Institute Granary Wharf ‚Äì Waterman's Place, Mint Hotel and Candle House ===The People's Award=== The short listed buildings for the People's Award of the Leeds Architecture Awards in 2003 were: *The School of Music, Cavendish Road, Leeds city centre *House Extension, 31 Westgate, Wetherby *The BT Headquarters, Neville Street, Leeds city centre *Ask, formerly the Rendezvous Caf√©, Market Place, Wetherby *The Chapel, Martin House, Boston Spa *K2 Development, Albion Street, Leeds city centre *Foxwood Flats, West Avenue, Roundhay *Mixed Development, 1 Dock Street, Leeds city centre *BBC Headquarters, Quarry Hill Leeds Civic Trust Blue Plaque ==Leeds Civic Trust== Leeds Civic Trust is a voluntary, non-profit body whose aims and objectives are to: *Stimulate interest in and care for the history and character of the city. *Encourage high standards of design, architecture and town planning. *Encourage the improvement of features of public amenity. *Promote co- operation in the achievement of these objectives. 17-19 Wharf Street: the shop and offices of Leeds Civic Trust The Trust works to preserve Leeds' architectural heritage and to ensure that new developments are of suitable quality for the city. It also organises the local Heritage Open Days in conjunction with the Civic Trust. The first blue plaque ===Blue Plaque Scheme=== In 1987 the Trust started putting up Blue plaques to honour notable buildings, objects and people in Leeds. The first was the Burley Bar Stone plaque marking one of the medieval gates of Leeds, the stone itself surviving within the building of the Leeds Building Society on Albion Street. The West Bar and East Bar were also marked, and in 2017 the 164th plaque marked the North Bar. ===Rainbow Plaques=== In association with the 2018 Leeds Pride event, the Trust announced that it would be creating a trail of Rainbow Plaques to commemorate those who have contributed to the LGBT+ story of Leeds. A map has been published showing the location of 15 plaques. ==See also== *Leeds *History of Leeds *List of tallest buildings in Leeds *Listed buildings in Leeds *:Category:Listed buildings in Leeds *List of Grade I listed buildings in Leeds *Brudenell School Leeds *List of council high-rise apartment buildings in the City of Leeds ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * ==External links== *Archiseek: Architecture of Leeds *Leeds Civic Trust *Leeds City Council Listed Buildings with link to current version of complete list, as Listed building gazetteer *Leeds Society of Architects Leeds Category:Leeds Blue Plaques ","title":"Architecture of Leeds"},{"id":"19304302","text":"Patle Pani is a village development committee in Bhojpur District in the Kosi Zone of eastern Nepal.

Built in 1908 during the booming lumbering era in Michigan, the State Theatre was originally known as the Bijou, and was one of the many vaudeville and burlesque houses in Bay City. In 1930 the theater was renovated and reopened as the \\"Bay\\". The ownership and the name of the theater changed over the years until July 2000, when the theater was purchased by the Bay City Downtown Development Authority who restored the Mayan motif marquee. ==History== In September 1908, the Bijou vaudeville theatre opened on Washington Avenue in Downtown Bay City. In August 1920 the theatre's name was changed to the \\"Orpheum\\". The theater was renovated in 1930 to resemble a Mayan pyramid by renowned architect C. Howard Crane whose impressive body of work includes the twin Fox Theatres in Detroit and St. Louis, Missouri.The Bay City Times, Volume 134, Number 256 Among the theater owners over the years were the Butterfield family who also owned theaters throughout the Flint/Great Lakes Bay region and the Ashman Brothers. ==Restoration== Renovations to the theater began in 2000 with the replacement of the roof, carpet, and stage curtains, and seating. The hardwood floors were refinished, and the lighting and sound systems were updated. A new stage was created in front of the existing screen which enabled the theatre to be used for small productions. The elaborate internal paint theme was restored in 2005. ===Digital projector=== In August 2008, The State Theatre became the first single-screen theater with a digital projection system in the United States. ===New marquee=== On September 11, 2008 a new marquee was unveiled. The new design was created and built by Eric E. Larsen in the spirit of the theater from the time of the Mayan redesign of 1930. The $220,000 marquee, with its retro Mayan Indian headdress, digital display, and colorful lighting, is part of a multi- phase project to renovate the theater. ==ReferencesCategory:Cinemas and movie theaters in Michigan Category:Buildings and structures in Bay County, Michigan Category:Bay City, Michigan Category:Event venues established in 1908 Category:1908 establishments in Michigan ","title":"State Theatre (Bay City, Michigan)"},{"id":"19304348","text":"Kayamozhi is a village which is situated 9 km in west of Thiruchendur in Thoothukudi district, Tamil Nadu, India.

The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 was an act of the United States Congress, signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, that created the Federal Aviation Agency (later the Federal Aviation Administration or the FAA) and abolished its predecessor, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA).Federal Aviation Act, P.L. 85-726, 72 Stat. 731. Approved 1958-08-23.Travel Industry Dictionary. \\"Federal Aviation Act of 1958.\\" The act empowered the FAA to oversee and regulate safety in the airline industry and the use of American airspace by both military aircraft and civilian aircraft. ==Background== Aviation in the United States was unregulated until the Air Commerce Act became law in 1926.Air Commerce Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 568. Approved 1926-05-20. The Act created an Aeronautic Branch within the United States Department of Commerce with regulatory powers over civil aviation. Among the functions the Aeronautic Branch performed were pilot testing and licensing, issuing aircraft airworthiness certificates, establishing and enforcing safety regulations. The agency was also responsible for establishing airways and operating and maintaining aids to air navigation, in addition to investigating accidents and incidents. In 1934, the Aeronautics Branch was renamed the Bureau of Air Commerce. In 1936 the Bureau took over air traffic control centers previously operated by commercial airlines, and began to expand the air traffic control system. In 1938, the Civil Aeronautics Act moved oversight of non-military aviation into a new, independent agency, the Civil Aeronautics Authority.Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, P.L. 75-706, 52 Stat. 973. Approved 1938-06-23. The new agency gained the authority the power to regulate fares and routes for commercial airlines. Another change followed in 1940, with CAA's authority being split. The CAA continued to have authority for air traffic control, safety, and promotion of civil aviation. The new Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) was established and had responsibility for accident investigation, as well as regulation of safety of civil aviation and pricing of commercial aviation. A boom in the 1950s of aircraft technology and the airline industry crowded American airspace, and the regulation of air traffic was considered antiquated. In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Edward Peck Curtis as Special Assistant for Aviation. Later that year, Curtis was named by Eisenhower to head a commission to study the dramatic increase in airline traffic and to propose ways to deal with airplane traffic jams at airports. From that commission came a proposal to create a new Federal aviation agency that would replace the Civil Aeronautics Administration and the Civil Aeronautics Board to consolidate air operations, modernize the airways and to make and enforce safety rules. An ensuing series of plane accidents prompted the creation of the Federal Aviation Agency, later to be known as the Federal Aviation Administration. ==Mid-air collisions spur change== On the morning of June 30, 1956, United Flight 718 collided with TWA Flight 2 over the Grand Canyon, resulting in 128 deaths, which was at the time the largest loss of life in an aviation accident. This high-profile accident, which took place in uncontrolled airspace, raised public concern for airline safety.Around Arizona Index. \\"Grand Canyon Collision.\\" Revised 2007-10-16. In 1957 Congress passed the Airways Modernization Act that established the Airways Modernization Board (AMB) headed by General Elwood Quesada. Two subsequent mid-air collisions between military aircraft and commercial airliners, one near Las Vegas, Nevada (United Airlines Flight 736) on April 21, 1958, where 49 died, and one involving Capital Airlines (Capital Airlines Flight 300) over Brunswick, Maryland a month later on May 20 that cost 11 lives, showed further imperfections in the regulation of air traffic, particularly the need for unified control of airspace for civil and military flights. The day after the Brunswick collision, Senator Mike Monroney and Representative Oren Harris introduced the Federal Aviation Act. Two days after the Capital Airlines mid-air, a stopgap presidential proclamation was issued that 1) required military jet aircraft to fly by Instrument Flight Rules while in the civil airways below 25,000 ft. (later reduced to 20,000 ft.); 2) prohibited jet penetration swoops from high to low altitudes through civil airways. An exception was made for emergency jet-bomber and fighter \\"scrambles,\\" which would be continued whenever necessary for the national defense. Citing \\"recent midair collisions of aircraft occasioning tragic losses of human life,\\" President Eisenhower announced the White House's support of the legislation on June 13. The legislation passed Congress and was signed into law by Eisenhower on August 23, 1958. Eisenhower appointed AMB Chairman Quesada the first FAA Administrator. A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the DoD and FAA on the Future of Radar Approach Controls in the National Airspace System, 14 December 1988, states that the FAA \\"determines the standard for NAS equipment and ATC facilities\\" and that the \\"DoD will equip facilities providing services to civil users so that the ATC service is transparent to the user.\\" U.S. Department of Defense. \\"Operational Requirements Document II: DoD Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems in the National Airspace System.\\" ==Codification and repeal== In 1994 Congress recodified existing aviation legislation and the 1958 Aviation Act was repealed.An Act to revise, codify, and enact without substantive change certain general and permanent laws, related to transportation, as subtitles II, III, and V‚ÄìX of title 49, United States Code, \\"Transportation\\", and to make other technical improvements in the Code.

While the term eventually came to refer to a territorial unit, the royal domain originally referred to the network of \\"castles, villages and estates, forests, towns, religious houses and bishoprics, and the rights of justice, tolls and taxes\\" effectively held by the king or under his domination.Hallam, 80‚Äì82. In terms of territory, before the reign of Henry IV, the domaine royal did not encompass the entirety of the territory of the kingdom of France and for much of the Middle Ages significant portions of the kingdom were the direct possessions of other feudal lords. In the tenth and eleventh centuries, the first Capetians‚Äîwhile being the kings of France‚Äîwere among the least powerful of the great feudal lords of France in terms of territory possessed. Patiently, through the use of feudal law (and, in particular, the confiscation of fiefs from rebellious vassals), conquest, annexation, skillful marriages with heiresses of large fiefs, and even by purchase, the kings of France were able to increase the royal domain. By the time of Philip IV, the meaning of \\"royal domain\\" began to shift from a mere collection of lands and rights to a fixed territorial unit,Hallam, 247. and by the sixteenth century the \\"royal domain\\" began to coincide with the entire kingdom. However, the medieval system of appanage (a concession of a fief with its land rights by the sovereign to his younger sons, which reverts to the crown upon the extinction of the male line of the original holder) alienated large territories from the royal domain and sometimes created dangerous rivals (especially the Duchy of Burgundy from the 14th to the 15th centuries). During the Wars of Religion, the alienation of lands and fiefs from the royal domain was frequently criticized. The Edict of Moulins (1566) declared that the royal domain (defined in the second article as all the land controlled by the crown for more than ten years) could not be alienated, except in two cases: by interlocking, in the case of financial emergency, with a perpetual option to repurchase the land; and to form an appanage, which must return to the crown in its original state on the extinction of the male line. Traditionally, the king was expected to survive from the revenues generated from the royal domain, but fiscal necessity, especially in times of war, led the kings to enact \\"exceptional\\" taxes, like the taille, upon the whole of the kingdom (the taille became permanent in 1439). ==Chronology of the formation of the royal domain== The Kingdom of France at the time of Hugh Capet. French royal domain in blue. ===House of Capet=== Reign of Hugh Capet At the beginning of Hugh Capet's reign, the crown estate was extremely small and consisted essentially of scattered possessions in the √éle-de-France and Orl√©anais regions (Senlis, Poissy, Orl√©ans), with several other isolated pockets, such as Attigny. These lands were largely the inheritance of the Robertians, the direct ancestors of the Capetians. * 988: Montreuil-sur-Mer, the first port held by the Capetians, is acquired through the marriage of the crown prince Robert (future Robert II the Pious) with Rozala, the widow of the Arnulf II, Count of Flanders.

ONTC operates freight and passenger services in northern Ontario through its Ontario Northland Railway and Ontario Northland Motor Coach services. It previously operated an airline, NorOntair (shut down in 1996), and a telecommunications company, Ontera (sold to Bell Aliant in 2014). ==HistoryEarly history=== ONTC traces its history to 1902 with the passage of the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway Act, which received Royal Assent on March 17. The Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway Commission (TNORC) would oversee the construction and operation of the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway (T&NO;). The sod was turned less than two months later by Ontario's Commissioner of Public Works, the Honourable Francis Robert Latchford, at Trout Lake on the outskirts of North Bay; North Bay also being the site of the \\"first spike\\" driven in construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) 20 years previous. Building the 253 mile T&NO; main line from North Bay to Cochrane was instrumental in opening this region of the province for development and settlement, with its construction being cited as the reason for the discovery of a massive silver deposit at Cobalt, as well as gold at Porcupine and Kirkland Lake. Six years after construction started, the federal government's National Transcontinental Railway (NTR) main line from Winnipeg, Manitoba to Moncton, New Brunswick crossed the T&NO; at Cochrane. In subsequent years, the TNORC authorized extending the railway first into western Quebec's gold and copper fields at Rouyn-Noranda and, following World War I, in 1921, the TONRC began extending the T&NO; northward from Cochrane to the shores of James Bay at Moosonee, where the T&NO; \\"Last Spike\\" was driven by the Honourable Justice Francis Robert Latchford in 1932. The Commission also worked closely with sister provincial Crown agency, the Ontario Hydro- Electric Commission, in developing hydroelectric generating stations on rivers in the region, such as at Island Falls and Fraserdale. ===New mandate=== In 1937, the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway Act was amended, enabling the TNORC to operate buses, trucks, and aircraft in order to transport passengers and freight. By 1938 the Commission had acquired 11 buses. In 1945, the Commission acquired the Temagami and the Nipissing Navigation Companies. The railway changed its name in 1946 to the present Ontario Northland Transportation Commission. The use of the word \\"transportation\\" instead of \\"railway\\" in the commission's new name reflected an expanded mandate for the organization. Enabling legislation in 1946 allowed the ONTC to acquire, construct, and operate boats, as well as hotels, tourist resorts, and restaurants. In 1960 it purchased a trucking firm, Star Transfer. In 1974 ONTC acquired Owen Sound Transportation Company and their ferry operations. It was spun off in 2002 as a separate operational enterprise agency.http://www.ontarioferries.com/en/history/ The railway is still operated today by the commission, which also operates other transport modes, including bus motor coach services along the Toronto-North Bay-Timmins-Hearst and Toronto-Sudbury-Timmins highway corridors. In 2016 Motor Coach started operating between Sudbury and Ottawa. In 2018, motor coach service was expanded between Manitoulin Island and Sudbury as well as a new Sudbury-Sault Ste. Marie-White River-Hearst route along Highway 17. It formerly operated a regional airline named NorOntair and a telecommunications company named Ontera. ===Proposed divestment=== On March 23, 2012, the Ontario Government announced that it would begin to wind down the ONTC, citing increased costs to the government and stagnant ridership. Passenger train service between Toronto and Cochrane (the Northlander) was terminated and replaced with additional bus service, and all assets of the corporation were to be sold off.Ministry of Northern Development and Mines press release, March 23, 2012Message from ONTC Chair Ted Hargreaves, March 23, 2012 ==Restructuring== Northern Ontario municipal leaders had continued to express their fears regarding the divestment. They indicated that the ONR provides a fundamental link to many remote and rural communities and provides freight transport to many companies, including mining and forestry, allowing them to thrive. They indicate that the government maintained its funding to the GO Transit network in Southern Ontario and it is important not forget about the important service the ONR provides to Northern Ontario residents. February 2014, the new premier of Ontario Kathleen Wynne met with northern community leaders and the head of the company and union to discuss the future of the company. They decided the union and management would present a reconstruction plan to the government for consideration. In late February, 2014 a report to restructure the ONTC was delivered to the Minister of Northern Development and Mines.

The report was well received by the minister who appreciated how management and labour come together to explore options for the corporation. In April 2014 the provincial government concluded the company would remain in public hands. However, the telecommunications division Ontera would be sold to Bell Aliant. The government would reinvest in the company to purchase new coaches and refurbish rolling stock for the Polar Bear Express. This decision was supported by other members of Provincial Parliament after the auditor general's review cited that it would have cost the taxpayer $820 million instead of saving $265.9 million over three years had the divestment proceeded. ==Transportation servicesRail=== ONTC operates freight and season train service in Northern Ontario.

After an acknowledgement of paternity by justice, his name was Kaden - that of his father. He was a painter of Polish origin who gained international attention in the 1960s for his powerful abstract compositions made of plaster and resin on board, with strips and rounds of rusted tin cans embedded on the surface. Later in the 60s, Tad√© expanded his work by wooden sculptures looking like insects or Mars people. In addition, he started his typical design of Mediterranean houses. Fuss-Kaden was born 15 September 1914 in Krakow, Poland, and was educated at Krakow University, the Institute of Plastic Arts, Warsaw, and the Academy of Fine Arts, Florence. After fleeing Poland in 1939, he lived in Switzerland, in Nice and in Paris. In Nice he won first prizes in 1951 and 1952 from the Mediterranean Union for Modern Art. In Paris he studied architecture and went on to design distinguished Mediterranean-Modern residences in Puerto de Andratx on Mallorca. He died 16 November 1985 and is buried in Andratx. In 1941 together with other Polish painters he renovated a ceiling painting of a chapel in Zuchwil, Switzerland and in 1942 delivered a design for glass windows of a church in Canton of Solothurn.

Welles Wilder as an indicator of trend strength in a series of prices of a financial instrument. ADX has become a widely used indicator for technical analysts, and is provided as a standard in collections of indicators offered by various trading platforms. ==Calculations== The ADX is a combination of two other indicators developed by Wilder, the positive directional indicator (abbreviated +DI) and negative directional indicator (-DI). The ADX combines them and smooths the result with a smoothed moving average. To calculate +DI and -DI, one needs price data consisting of high, low, and closing prices each period (typically each day). One first calculates the directional movement (+DM and -DM): :UpMove = today's high ‚àí yesterday's high :DownMove = yesterday's low ‚àí today's low :if UpMove > DownMove and UpMove > 0, then +DM = UpMove, else +DM = 0 :if DownMove > UpMove and DownMove > 0, then -DM = DownMove, else -DM = 0 After selecting the number of periods (Wilder used 14 days originally), +DI and -DI are: :+DI = 100 times the smoothed moving average of (+DM) divided by average true range :-DI = 100 times the smoothed moving average of (-DM) divided by average true range The smoothed moving average is calculated over the number of periods selected, and the average true range is a smoothed average of the true ranges. Then: :ADX = 100 times the smoothed moving average of the absolute value of (+DI ‚àí -DI) divided by (+DI + -DI) Variations of this calculation typically involve using different types of moving averages, such as an exponential moving average, a weighted moving average or an adaptive moving average. Do Adaptive Moving Averages Lead To Better Results? By Michael Carr ==Interpretation== The ADX does not indicate trend direction or momentum, only trend strength. It is a lagging indicator; that is, a trend must have established itself before the ADX will generate a signal that a trend is under way. ADX will range between 0 and 100. Generally, ADX readings below 20 indicate trend weakness, and readings above 40 indicate trend strength. An extremely strong trend is indicated by readings above 50. Alternative interpretations have also been proposed and accepted among technical analysts. For example it has been shown how ADX is a reliable coincident indicator of classical chart pattern development, whereby ADX readings below 20 occur just prior to pattern breakouts. The value of the ADX is proportional to the slope of the trend. The slope of the ADX line is proportional to the acceleration of the price movement (changing trend slope). If the trend is a constant slope then the ADX value tends to flatten out. ==Timing== Various market timing methods have been devised using ADX. One of these methods is discussed by Alexander Elder in his book Trading for a Living. One of the best buy signals is when ADX turns up when below both Directional Lines and +DI is above -DI. You would sell when ADX turns back down. == References == Category:Technical indicators ","title":"Average directional movement index"},{"id":"19304777","text":"Christmas with Glen Campbell is the fifty-fifth album by American singer/guitarist Glen Campbell, released in 1995 (see 1995 in music). ==Track listing== # \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\\" (J.

Coach service began in 1937 following the amendments to the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway Act that allowed the then Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway to operate buses in Northern Ontario. Ontario Northland Motor Coach Services operates passenger and parcel transportation service between Greater Toronto (from the Toronto Coach Terminal, Yorkdale Bus Terminal and Bus Terminal) and locations in Central and Northern Ontario. There are two scheduled routes running north‚Äìsouth between Toronto and Hearst; the Highway 11 corridor, through North Bay and Cochrane, and the Highway 400/69/144 corridor, through Parry Sound, Sudbury and Timmins. There are also routes running east‚Äìwest between Sudbury and Ottawa and between White River and North Bay.Ontario Northland, Motor Coach Services, Route Map All buses have complimentary WiFi for passengers which is available wherever a cellphone signal exists. There are scheduled rest stops for passengers every hour and a half or so. The bus service was suspended when a drivers' strike began on September 29, 2007. The strike left the train as the only public transportation available for many communities; bus service did not resume until December 11, 2007. ==Divestment== In 2012 the provincial government announced the divestment of the crown corporation citing it could no longer subsidize the money-losing operation. The government then cancelled the Northlander passenger train service from Toronto to Cochrane. Then premier Dalton McGuinty vowed to keep the coaches running after the Crown agency is sold off (the number of coaches in service has increased to compensate for the lack of the passenger train service) to continue to provide transit to remote Northern Ontario. ==Restructuring== Northern Ontario municipal leaders had continued to express their fears regarding the divestment. They indicated that the ONR provides a fundamental link to many remote and rural communities and provides freight transport to many companies, including mining and forestry, allowing them to thrive. They indicate that the government maintained its funding to the GO Transit network in Southern Ontario and it is important not forget about the important service the ONR provides to Northern Ontario residents. February 2014, the new premier of Ontario Kathleen Wynne met with northern community leaders and the head of the company and union to discuss the future of the company. They decided the union and management would present a reconstruction plan to the government for consideration. In late February 2014, a report to restructure the ONTC was delivered to the Minister of Northern Development and Mines. The proposal detailed how the organization could be modernized both culturally and in job reductions through attrition. The report was well received by the minister who appreciated how management and labour come together to explore options for the corporation. In April 2014, the provincial government concluded the company would remain in public hands. However, Ontera (its telecommunication division) was sold off to Bell Aliant. The government reinvested in the company to purchase new coaches and refurbish rolling stock for the Polar Bear Express. This decision was supported by other members of Provincial Parliament after the auditor general's review cited that it would have cost the taxpayer $820 million instead of saving $265.9 million over three years had the divestment proceeded. As per recent restructuring efforts, the ONTC closed the bus station in Englehart and Matheson which were replaced by an agency (as in other smaller locations) and with online solutions such as e-ticketing. New Liskeard, Kirkland Lake and Sudbury also had their hours reduced and will be closed on weekends (instead functioning as stops). The bus schedules themselves are not affected. In January 2016, the ONTC announced a route running east‚Äìwest, between Sudbury and Ottawa (Eastbound - Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays and Westbound - Fridays, Saturdays and Mondays). While historically serviced by Greyhound, that company recently reduced its service along this corridor with only a night bus remaining. In this case Ontario Northland has provided daytime service with a bus leaving Ottawa at 7 AM and from Sudbury at 2:05 PM. This marked the first time in the company's history that they have serviced Highway 17. , new funding from the provincial government allowed for further expansion Westward covering an additional 750 km and 20 communities West of Sudbury to White River. Feasibility studies are underway to determine whether service expansion would include other communities currently not serviced, including Hornepayne and servicing a number of communities on Manitoulin Island. Based on these studies, Ontario Northland initiated weekday bus service to Manitoulin Island including 15 different stops. , Ontario Northland initiated new service between Sault Ste.

It is based on The Mole franchise of programs that have aired in numerous countries. The sub-title for the Australian version of the show was a simple question: \\"Who is the traitor?\\" Its most recent season aired in 2013. The series is a reality competition in which the contestants work as a group to add money to a kitty that only one of them will win. Among the contestants is one person who has been designated \\"the Mole\\" by the producers and is tasked with sabotaging the group's money-making efforts. His or her identity is unknown until the end of the series, when two genuine contestants take a final quiz in the final episode regarding details of the Mole. At the end of each episode, the contestant who knows the least about who the mole is, as decided by the results of a quiz, is eliminated from the game. The series was hosted by actor Grant Bowler in its first four seasons, and subsequently by Tom Williams, who filled in for Bowler in the fifth season due to a prior commitment on Bowler's part, and Shura Taft. The first three seasons, as well as the sixth, all took place in Australia, but the fourth and fifth were set in New Caledonia and New Zealand respectively. The first season was produced by Mason Media Group. Seasons two to five were produced within Seven and executive produced by David Mason. The sixth season was produced by FremantleMedia Australia. ==FormatContestants=== Contestants typically meet each other very shortly before shooting begins. However, in season six, contestants only met each other as a whole group for the first time upon completion of the very first assignment of the game, which saw them split into three groups of four, blindfolded and left at an unknown destination. Unlike in the American version of the show, player alliances are quite rare and are considered, by many players in fact, cheating. Only the most informal, friendship-based groups ever took shape, and only in Seasons 2 and 5. Season 6 had many alliances formed, in part due to the fact that exemptions were now tangible items that could be traded freely and the introduction of freebies saw players using them as currency or bribes. However, in season 2, it was revealed that after the Robbery Game in episode 4, three of the contestants had entered into an agreement that if one of them won the group kitty, $20,000 would be given to each of the other two, as long as none of them was the Mole. ===Assignments=== Each episode features multiple assignments (called \\"challenges\\" in season one, and occasionally in the later seasons), of varying size and value, that are worth money to the group kitty (or \\"pot\\" in season six) if successfully completed. Some assignments have penalties associated with them if they are failed. The assignments will alternatively require physical skill, mental acuity, keen strategy, or all three from the players for them to be successfully completed. In some cases, however, an assignment was not fully explained to all contestants, increasing its difficulty. In those cases, perhaps only selected contestants were informed of the full nature of the challenge, and must work towards a different goal than the rest. There were often assignments that were based on extreme sports or otherwise appeared dangerous. Overcoming fears was often a theme behind some of these challenges. Some of the challenges from season four in French-speaking New Caledonia were also based on having the language barrier as a hurdle, and others in Australia and New Zealand in the other seasons involved the players needing the assistance of unsuspecting citizens in the cities where they were based in order to be completed (such as in the third season, in which there were no local contestants mainly due to the season being based in Queensland, an assignment required them to search for their luggage at an unknown location). Some assignments require every member of the team to successfully complete their part for money to be won, while others will assign a value for each individual player to finish. The players are commonly told to separate into several groups, such as \\"leaders\\" and \\"followers,\\" which determines particular roles for an assignment. Assignments often have explicit rules designed to increase their difficulty attached to them, with monetary penalties from the pot assessed if they are violated. Rule violations outside the boundaries of an assignment can also cost the team money from the pot, though this is less common. ===Quizzes and elimination=== At the end of each episode, the players take a computer test based on the identity of the Mole, asking questions such as \\"Who is the Mole?\\" or \\"What did the Mole eat for breakfast?\\" The player who scored the lowest on the quiz each time was eliminated (or, in season six, \\"terminated\\") from the game and immediately sent away. The length of the computer test varied by season; in season one the quiz was twenty questions, in seasons two and three it was ten questions in length, and in season four it was reduced further to six questions. Season five changed the elimination format slightly ‚Äì the players would spend a weekend in New Zealand completing assignments and then return to the Seven Network studio in Sydney to take a live quiz and face a live elimination. Five questions were part of the live broadcast, such as \\"Who is the Mole?\\" and \\"What group was the Mole in for the first challenge?\\" while before the live portion of the show, five questions based on profiles, such as \\"How many brothers and sisters does the Mole have?\\" and \\"What city does the Mole live in?\\" were asked. Season 6 returned to a quiz of twenty questions similar to season 1. The final quiz is normally double the number of questions from the earlier quizzes (for example, in season six, the final quiz was 40 questions, the first ten of which were asked by Shura Taft, that season's host, and then the nine eliminated contestants in the order of their departure from the game). Players can sometimes earn freebies (corrects a wrong answer) or free passes (sometimes known as \\"exemptions\\" or \\"immunity\\") through to the next round. In contrast to the American series, these are usually quite rare (they increased in number in season five), and the exempted player does not take the quiz. However, in season six, players who won exemptions would have to defend them in later assignments, or risk losing them. If there was a tie for the lowest score, the player in the tie who took the longest time to take the quiz would be eliminated. Sometimes, contestants are offered the chance to give up their free pass in exchange for a particular amount of money to be added to the kitty; however, he or she must still take the quiz. A host can reveal who is exempt from elimination before the process begins, as by then he or she would have completed the quiz by then (this happened in seasons 3 and 5). In this case, a contestant would have had to have bid money from the kitty to buy the free pass, with the highest bidder being awarded the exemption. As he or she has already taken the quiz, they can opt out of being eliminated by keeping the free pass and not adding money to the kitty, or take the risk of being eliminated by giving up the free pass and adding money to the kitty. In this case, that amount of money is therefore doubled and added to the kitty (e.g. a contestant who has bid $24,000 for a free pass could give it up and therefore add $48,000 to the kitty), with that contestant being put back into the elimination pool. In both seasons 3 and 5, the contestant has given up his or her free pass, and both succeeded. In season 6 players can also earn \\"Freebies\\". If a player chooses to use, then a question that was answered incorrectly on the quiz will be counted as a correct answer. Similar to Big Brother, eliminated contestants are immediately isolated from the group, and then driven by car to a separate hotel that night, before flying home to their native states the following morning. ==Season overview== {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !Series !Premiere !Finale !Host !The Mole !Winner !Runner-up !Amount won !Location - 1 27 February 2000 24 April 2000 rowspan=\\"4\\" Grant Bowler Alan Mason Jan Moody Abby Coleman $115,000  (Tasmania) - 2 21 February 2001 25 April 2001 Michael Laffy Brooke Marshall Hal Pritchard $100,000  (Victoria) - 3 20 February 2002 24 April 2002 Alaina Taylor Crystal-Rose Cluff Marc Jongebloed $108,000  (Gold Coast) - 4 27 July 2003 28 September 2003 Petrina Edge Shaun Faulkner Nathan Beves $104,000  - 5 25 August 2005 28 October 2005 Tom Williams John Whitehall Liz Cantor Craig Murell $203,000  - 6 2 July 2013 16 October 2013 Shura Taft Erin Dooley Hillal Kara-Ali Aisha Jefcoate $180,000  } ===Locations map=Awards== Logie Awards: *2001 Most Popular Reality Program (won) *2002 Most Popular Reality Program (lost to Big Brother) *2003 Most Popular Reality Program (lost to RPA) *2004 Most Popular Reality Program (lost to Australian Idol) *2006 Most Popular Reality Program (lost to Australian Idol) ==Notable contestants and statistics== *Alan Mason, the first season's Mole, was the adjudicator on The Weakest Link throughout that show's entire run. *Abby Coleman, the runner-up of the first season, is now a presenter on Brisbane's HIT 105.

Burnetia is known so far from a single holotype skull lacking the lower jaws described by South African paleontologist Robert Broom in 1923. Due to erosion and dorsoventral crushing, features of the skull are hard to interpret. Stutural lines are further distorted by the unusual shape of the skull roof, including many bosses and protuberances. == Description == When broadly looking at the skull, there are well developed ‚Äúcheeks‚Äù, bosses, and pits that resemble Pareiasaurians. However, the small temporal fossa distinguishes it from the Cotylosaur. The overall shape resembles a triangle. In the nasals, there is a bulging expansion of bone. Unlike proburnetia‚Äôs median nasal bridge being long, narrow, and raised, Burnetia is splindle-shaped. The median nasal boss is spindle-shaped The snout is wide and blunt. The large preorbital pits on the lachrymal are significant. Over the orbit there are notable ridges on the prefrontal and frontal. The supra-orbital ridges make the orbits face distally and posteriorly. The suborbital eminence is subdivided into distinguished portions. The small pineal foramen sits dorsally on a boss. Burnetia‚Äôs palate is similar to Gorgonopsians. Anteriorly, the internal nares have the lower canines. The maxilla is adjacent to the palatine, and posterior to the palatine is the long prevomer that meets the premaxilla. The palatine is tooth bearing, as well as the pterygoid that is just posterior to the palatine. The vomer is held by the surrounding vomerine processes that form the choanae‚Äôs middle border. Unlike the rest of burnetiamorphs, Burnetia‚Äôs interchoanal part of the vomer is not narrow. The concave occiput is tilted up, which is shown when it is aligned vertically, the snout faces downward. The supraoccipital sits anterior to the paraoccipital. The size of the basioccipital is considered to be small. The majority of the occipital surface, posterior ‚Äúhorn‚Äù, and posterior lateral margins are made from the squamosal. The basisphenoid in Burnetia differs from Gorgonopsians. In Burnetia, their basisphenoid is round and shallow. In the middle of the basisphenoid, it is separated by a groove. Gorgonopsians‚Äô basisphenoid contrasts Burnetia‚Äôs by having a ‚Äúsingle sharp median keel‚Äù. == Discovery == Broom found Burnetia mirabilis in the Dicynodon Assemblage Zone near Graaff-Reinet, South Africa. Broom concluded that Burnetia was related closest to the group of Gorgonopsians. However Broom made observations based on the skull when it was covered by matrix and no underlying bone was visible. Lieuwe Boonstra removed this matrix and found that Burnetia and Gorgonopsians differed mainly by the thickening of dermal bones, bosses, and their basisphenoids. == Paleoenvironment == Phylogenetic analysis done by Ashley Kruger suggests that a likely origin for burnetiamorphs could be southern Africa. The base and oldest burnetiamorphs are found in South Africa. == Classification and related taxa == The family Burnetiidae came from the discovery of Burnetia, but new discoveries led to the studies of burnetiamorphs. Burnetiamorphs only have about two taxa that represent each genus. It was previously believed that the Burnetiidae clade only contained two taxa, Burnetia mirabilis and Proburnetia viatkensis, but later Pachydectes and Bullacephalus were found to be included in the clade, as well. It was unable to be confirmed if Pachydectes shared the feature of nasal the nasal supporting a middle boss like Burnetia. However, like Burnetia, above the postrbital bar they have a significant boss. Lycaenodon longiceps is in the clade Biarmosuchia and has some similarities to Burnetia. Both Lycaenodon and Burnetia likely had a large formamen, surrounded by the vomer and vomerine process. This foramen implies that in biamosuchians, the vomeronasal organ may have communicated with the oral cavity. They also share the trait of having a long vomerine process. The first burnetiid therapsid found in Tanzania‚Äôs Usili Formation was found to most resemble Burnetia. The Usili burnetiid and Burnetia both had bosses above their orbits that were ‚ÄùS‚Äù-like. ==References== Category:Biarmosuchian genera Category:Lopingian synapsids of Africa Category:Fossil taxa described in 1923 Category:Taxa named by Robert Broom Category:Lopingian genus first appearances Category:Lopingian genus extinctions ","title":"Burnetia"},{"id":"19304815","text":"Tsakalotos is a Greek surname.

Fossils of Tetracynodon have been found in the Karoo Basin of South Africa. Two species are known: the type species T. tenuis from the Late Permian and the species T. darti from the Early Triassic. Both species were small-bodied and probably fed on insects and small vertebrates. Although Tetracynodon is more closely related to mammals than it is to reptiles, its braincase is very primitive and shares more in common with modern amphibians and reptiles than it does with mammals. ==Permo- Triassic survivorship== Tetracynodon was one of the few therapsid genera known to have survived the Permo-Triassic extinction event. Aside from Tetracynodon, the only therocephalian genera known from both sides of the Permo-Triassic boundary are Moschorhinus and Promoschorhynchus. The Triassic species Tetracynodon darti would have been part of the extinction's survivor fauna, a low-diversity community of therapsids and other land vertebrates. The Triassic species Tetracynodon darti is relatively small compared to Permian baurioids. This may be a possible example of the Lilliput effect in which small species are more common immediately after a mass extinction. ==Phylogeny== Tetracynodon was once classified among a group of therocephalians called scaloposaurids, all characterized by their very small size. Scaloposauridae is no longer recognized as a valid group because many scaloposaurid features are now thought to be characteristics of juvenile individuals rather than evidence of close evolutionary relationships. In 2008, Tetracynodon tenuis was proposed to be a juvenile of the larger therocephalian Lycideops, which is known from the same Late Permian strata. Since T. tenuis is the type species of Tetracynodon and the type species of Lycideops, L. longiceps, was named earlier than T. tenuis, the species would be a synonym of Lycideops longiceps and the genus Tetracynodon would be invalid. Moreover, since the study found that Lycideops was not directly related to the Early Triassic Tetracynodon darti, it suggested that this lineage of therocephalians did not survive uninterrupted past the Permo-Triassic extinction event. Tetracynodon was included in a phylogenetic analysis of therocephalians in 2012 and was placed in clade Baurioidea along with many other prior scaloposaurids. It was found to nest in a smaller clade with Lycideops and Choerosaurus, designated as the family Lycideopidae. Tetracynodon tenuis and T. darti were found to be sister taxa, meaning that they were a valid phylogenetic grouping and T. tenuis could not be a juvenile of Lycideops.

It follows \\"Art and Revolution\\" and precedes \\"Jewishness in Music\\", developing the ideas of the one and prefiguring some of the issues of the other. Wagner wrote the whole essay over about two months in Z√ºrich. He wrote to his friend Uhlig on November 1849, 'This will be the last of my literary works'. On this, as on many other matters in his life, Wagner was to change his mind. The essay is dedicated to the philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach, whose works (perhaps particularly Principles of the Philosophy of the Future), inspired some of its ideas.Millington (1992), p. 231; Wagner (1993), pp. ix, 69. All translations of Wagner's texts in this article are taken from this edition. In September and October 1849, Wagner had read both Feuerbach's Reflections on Death and Immortality and his The Essence of Christianity.Gregor-Dellin (1976), 85‚Äì86 Wagner's biographer Ernest Newman opined that Wagner's prose style in this essay and others was also heavily influenced by Feuerbach, who was 'constitutionally prone to the antithetical'; whilst noting that within a few years Wagner rejected Feuerbach's philosophy for that of Schopenhauer.Newman (1976), p. 431 The title of the essay was to haunt Wagner; thereafter his opponents were to taunt him as a self-appointed prophet of 'the music of the future'. Immediately following the essay Wagner dashed off a draft libretto, mostly in prose, Wieland der Schmied (Wieland the Smith), outlined at the close of the essay itself, which he thought appropriate as material for his ideal music-drama, and originally intended to develop for production in Paris. However he abandoned this plan, and the draft eventually became the basis for the first Slovak opera, Kovac Wiland, by J√°n Levoslav Bella, (produced in Bratislava in 1924). ==Content== Wagner begins, 'As Man stands to Nature, so stands Art to Man.'Wagner (1993), p. 69 Man, or more particularly the Volk (the community of 'men who feel a common and collective want') creates Art to fill that want. Those who feel no want are outsiders to the Volk and crave only pointless luxury ‚Äì true Art thus comes only from the atavistic needs of the Volk. When luxury (by which Wagner implies base entertainment posing as true art ‚Äì i.e. Grand Opera and its like) has been abolished by the Volk they will be able to join to create the Artwork of the Future.Wagner (1993), p. 77 Wagner goes on to talk of the three basic elements of art, which he lists as 'Dance, Tone [i.e. music] and Poetry' which were originally united in ancient Greek drama (as extolled by Wagner in Art and Revolution). Modern attempts to unite these give rise to the 'unnatural abortion, the Oratorio', and to the 'shameless insolence' of contemporary operaWagner (1993), p. 151 Only when these and other tawdry entertainments are swept aside will the Artwork of the Future arise. This artwork will command all the arts ‚Äì 'Architecture can set before herself no higher task than to frame' it,Wagner (1993), p. 184 (an early prefiguring of the Bayreuth Festspielhaus). The Artwork of the Future will of course bring forth the Artist of the Future who will be 'without a doubt the Poet.' Wagner points out that it is a matter of indifference whether this be a word-poet or a tone-poet, perhaps hinting at exactly what sort of a fellow this Artist must be. However the Darsteller (translated by Ellis as 'performer' but perhaps meaning rather the 'purveyor') of the Artwork will be a communal matter, a 'fellowship of all artists'.Wagner (1993), pp. 195‚Äì96 In this communal aspect of the Artwork of the Future, Newman sees an anticipation of the Bayreuth Festival concept.Newman (1976) pp. 253‚Äì54 The essay closes with a pr√©cis of Wieland the Smith. ==NotesBibliography== * M.

Founded in 1934, the school is governed by the Society of the Brothers of St. Patrick (Ireland). It is located in the heart of the city of Dehradun on the main thoroughfare Rajpur Road. St. Joseph's Academy, Dehradun celebrated the bicentenary of the Patrician Society and the school's 75th anniversary in 2009. ==History== St. Joseph's Academy was formally opened and blessed on 2 March 1934 by Rev. Fr. Antanasius. Rev. Bro. A.M. Keogh was the first principal of SJA. When it opened its doors the roll-call was 21; in 1959, over a thousand students were attending the school. At present, the school has a student strength of 3400 and 120 teachers. St. Joseph's Academy has an auditorium, built in 1984 and inaugurated by Mother Teresa. The auditorium has a sitting capacity of nearly 1300 people. In 2004 St. Joseph's completed 70 years, to commemorate the occasion, the play ‚ÄòPeter Pan‚Äô was staged. The musical 'Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat' was staged in 2006 and on the 80th anniversary the musical 'Anandsagar' was staged. ==Motto== The school motto (Latin) is \\"Laborare Est Orare\\", which means \\"Work is Worship\\". ==School song== How fair is the far spreading vale of the Doon In clear sparkling sunshine or darkling monsoon, But the spot we love best of the beauty spots there Is St. Joseph‚Äôs the pride of the valley so fair? She calls us to loyalty, honour and truth, To wear Joseph‚Äôs lily in bright blameless youth, And e‚Äôen to old age may her lessons remain, To live our lives bravely and die without stain Let our voices ring out o‚Äôer the Doon‚Äôs verdant vale, In a jubilant shout, as we tell the proud tale Of the name and the fame of the best school of all, Of our dear Alma Mater and answer her call, So Academicians in work and in play, You‚Äôll swiftly and happily pass each glad day, Of the years bright and brief that will end all too soon In St. Joseph‚Äôs the pearl of the vale of the Doon. ==Academics== The school is affiliated to the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations. The school conducts the standard 10th ICSE and the standard 12th ISC examinations. SJA offers education from Kindergarten to Class 12th, with five to six sections in each class. Students have a choice to study Science or Commerce after Class 10th. Most recently, Bhuvanya Vijay was the all India ISC topper in 2013 with 99.99% marks. ==House system== The student body is divided into four different houses. This is done to cultivate in the students a sense of competitiveness, dedication and teamwork. Events such as Cultural Week(CONFLUENCE), the Sports-Day and the House Cup are held in the year. The four houses of the school are: * BERGIN (Blue) * DONOVAN (Yellow) * DOOLEY (Green) * DUFFY(Red) The houses have been named after the former Principals of the school. ==Cultural week== Cultural Week was first a non-competitive show wherein students performed in events such music, dramatics, dance, debate, and G.K. Quizzes. It was changed to a 3‚Äì4 days, Inter-House competitive event in 1996. Discontinued for a few years, a Cultural Week was organized on the 75th anniversary of the school, in 2009. Bro. A.J. George restarted the cultural week and now it is a biennial event. It was renamed 'CONFLUENCE' in 2017. Since the last 2 years, i.e. 2019 and 2020, the 'CONFLUENCE' or the Cultural week has not been organized. ==Sports== It has teams for cricket, football, basketball, hockey, lawn tennis, table tennis, badminton, volleyball and chess. Students compete in inter-house events as well as inter-school events. The school teams have won various Inter-school competitions hosted by the CISCE Board as well as many district tournaments. ===Sports Day=== The Annual Athletics Meet events are short races (100m, 200m, 400m), long races (800m, 1500m), javelin, short-put, long-jump, high jump and relay races. Students participate in the categories of Sub- juniors, Juniors, and Seniors. The final event of the day is the cycle race. The school awards trophies for individual performance followed by the inter- house shield; awarded to the house with maximum points on the day. ==Student Council== The Student Council comprises 38 members. Council members are chosen by the faculty and Principal. Members lead their houses in inter-house and inter-school events throughout the year. The breakdown is as follows: * 2 House Captains (1 male, 1 female). Appointed in class 12, on basis of academic achievements. * 2 Sports Captains (1 male, 1 female). Appointed in class 12, on basis of athletic performance in the Sports Day, or any other sports- related achievements such as being a national- or international-level player. * 1 Cultural prefect (Male or Female). Appointed in class 12, on basis of cultural contributions to the house, such as representing the school in inter- school events, or the Cultural Week * 2 Vice prefects (1 male, 1 female). Appointed in class 11, if he has shown to have potential to be a prefect or head boy/girl in the future. Usually on basis of academic achievement. * 2 Special Prefects (Both Males or Females or 1 male and 1 female) In addition to these, there is a Head Boy and Head Girl. ==Notable alumni== The school has an official alumni association that has its own website. * Prahlad Kakkar - Founder and key Directors for Genesis Film Productions, an Indian production houses, established in 1977. * Vijai Singh Shekhawat - Chief of Naval Staff of the Indian Navy. * Nitin Sahrawat - Actor, environmentalist. * Jubin Nautiyal - Indian playback singer * Abhimanyu Easwaran-First class cricketer * Anirudh Thapa-India under 19 football team captain * Pranati Rai Prakash-Winner of India's next top model. * Prem Rawat-Spiritual Leader. * Navtej Sarna-Indian ambassador to the United States, Author-columnist(former Ambassador to United States, High Commissioner to UK and Ambassador to Israel) ==References * School website * Alumni website Category:Patrician Brothers schools Category:Catholic schools in India Category:Boarding schools in Uttarakhand Category:Christian schools in Uttarakhand Category:Schools in Dehradun Category:Educational institutions established in 1934 Category:1934 establishments in India ","title":"St Joseph's Academy, Dehradun"},{"id":"19304902","text":"Fred Parkinson Holliday DSO, MC, AFC (20 February 1888 ‚Äì 5 March 1980), was an Australian-born fighter pilot and ace of the First World War.

Multiple tooth-rowed captorhinids from the Early Permian fissure fills of the Bally Mountain Locality of Oklahoma. Vertebrate Anatomy Morphology Palaeontology, 1, pp.35-49. This is a characteristic it does not share with its name-sake Labidosaurus hamatus whose dentition resembles more basal, mainly single- tooth-rowed forms Dodick, J.T. and Modesto, S.P., 1995. The cranial anatomy of the captorhinid reptile Labidosaurikos meachami from the Lower Permian of Oklahoma. Palaeontology, 38(3), p.687. . The first fossils of Labidosaurikos came from Oklahoma and latter finds were discovered in Texas. Most information attributed to Labidosaurikos is based on the cranial anatomy of the only well supported species type Labidosaurikos meachami as there are no collections of the appendicular skeleton. Captorhinid anatomy and interrelationships are known primarily from other lower Permian genera such as Romeria, Protocaptorhinus, Rhiodenticulatus, Captorhinus and Labidosaurus. Labidosaurikos is a part of a less well known collection captorhinids from younger Permian deposits, Moradisaurus is an example.Modesto, S.P., Flear, V.J., Dilney, M.M. and Reisz, R.R., 2016. A large moradisaurine tooth plate from the Lower Permian of Texas and its biostratigraphic implications. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 36(6), p.e1221832. ==Description== Labidosaurikos were large herbivorous anapsid reptiles with heavily ornamented skull and had a hooked snout characteristic of all captorhinids. The consensus on representative species of the genus Labidosaurikos is Labidosaurikos meachami as this is the proposed species type with the most complete fossil skull and jaw. Estimations of body length come in at about 1.3 meters based on ratios of body length to skull length in other large herbivorous captorhinids like Captorhinus aguti. However most anatomical descriptions are limited by the fact that only skulls and cranial and mandible fragments make up the fossil record. Without appendicular skeleton or fragments there cannot be evidence- based description of more morphology aside from the skull. ===Skull=== Of the Labidosaurikos fossil collection the largest adult skull specimen was 280mm making it the second largest captorhinid compared to Moradisaurus gandis, a fellow member of the multiple rowed tooth plate captorhinid subfamily Moradisaurinae. Labidosaurikos skull has broadly flared posterior cheeks that are seen in all other multitoothed taxa as well as its Labidosaurus name sake. The foramens present on the skull include a pineal foramen on dorsal plane and the orbits and external naires that are elliptical in appearance. On the skull roof the frontal bones are little more than a third of the total length of the skull and have parallel sided that terminate posteriorly on a connection perpendicular to the antero-posterior axis. In addition Labidosaurikos characteristically long and slender Prefrontals with lacrimals that are wide and narrow moving anteriorly towards the nares are key characters for which the initial resemblance to Labidosaurus was noted. A captorhinid feature, the long hooked snout consists of a long overlapping junction between nasal and lacrimal bonesKissel, R.A., Dilkes, D.W. and Reisz, R.R., 2002. Captorhinus magnus, a new captorhinid (Amniota: Eureptilia) from the Lower Permian of Oklahoma, with new evidence on the homology of the astragalus. Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, 39(9), pp.1363-1372. although the nasal is slightly broader than those of most other captorhinids and extends ventrolaterally slightly more than half-way down the snout. More posterior features includes post frontals and post orbitals that are comparatively short and differ only slightly in size. The parietals are described as arched and the pair of parietals give the skull roof a slightly domed appearance unlike the parietals of other captorhinids.Olson, E.C., 1951. Vertebrates from the Choza formation, Permian of Texas. The Journal of Geology, 59(2), pp.178-181. Each one of the parietals is bowed parasaggitally and overlaps sutures of several skull roof elements. When examining these overlapping skull roof elements and the dorsal portion of the skull as a whole there is significant dermal sculpturing. Large pits surround the post parietal suture and are deeper than all other pits that occur on the skull. ===Palate and Dentition=== The palate of Labidosaurikos shares a general resemblance to the captorhinid pattern however; there are some specializations that come with the presence of multiple rows of teeth. Some of these features include transverse constriction of the palate by medially expanding tooth laminae of the maxillae and the loss of teeth from the palatine and anterior process of the pterygoid. The vomer is exceptionally slender, long and smoothly convex anteriorly which is a trait shared by Moradisaurus. The anteroventrally directed premaxillae which contain five long premaxillary teeth that decrease in size posteriorly as is the case in other captorhinids. The maxilla is greatly enlarged medially this constricts the palate and forms a tooth plate that accommodates the 6 parallel rows of teeth. Teeth that occur in the maxilla have been considered isodonts. The lateral surface of the maxilla presents a lateral flexion that is a characteristic cheek swelling seen in the single rowed Labidosaurus, Captorhinus aguti and other multi rowed genus. In addition the septomaxilla is characteristic of the family group, however it sports a sculptured postero- dorsal process extending onto the skull roof to insert between lacrimal and nasal. Much like expansion in the maxillae the dentaries expand transversely on the alveolar accommodate multiple rows of teeth. These 6 rows conical peg like teeth occur on medially expanded on both maxillae and dentaries. ==Paeloenviornmental Information and PaleobiologyEnvironment=== Labidosaurikos specimens have been found in Permian red beds of North American. Specimens have been found within Hennessey shale in Crescent, Oklahoma as well as the Lower Vale, Choza, and Arroyo Formations in northern central Texas. These locations have yielded critical information about early tetrapod evolution and Captorhinids are extremely common in these deposits. All locations have been correlated with each other to be formed in the Lower Permian sometime within the Kungurian. The colored beds with alternating distinctive red-green margins are formed by nonmarine and marine series of sediments that were deposited contemporaneously over time.Anderson, G.E., 1941. Origin of line of color change in Red Bed deposition. Geological Society of America Bulletin, 52(2), pp.211-218. The alternative sedimentation indicates the environment Labidosaurikos inhabited were the margins of the aquatic reservoirs that were plentiful in these areas during early Permian time and were able support substantial flora. ===Feeding/Diet=== One of the few aspects of Labidosaurikos biology and behavior that can be inferred from the limited fossil record is the diet. Morphology of the multi rowed dentition and aspects of the skull support the hypothesis of herbivorous diet.Modesto, S.P., Lamb, A.J. and Reisz, R.R., 2014. The captorhinid reptile Captorhinikos valensis from the lower Permian Vale Formation of Texas, and the evolution of herbivory in eureptiles. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 34(2), pp.291-302. Morphology of the dentition shows the tooth plate teeth are relatively small isodonts and have wear facets usually characteristic of grinding. Mandibular tooth rows rest between the maxillary tooth rows and have multiple contact points that could in motion pass one another which is necessary characteristic to shred fibrous plant material.Throckmorton, G.S., Hopson, J.A. and Parks, P., 1981. A redescription of Toxolophosaurus cloudi Olson, a Lower Cretaceous herbivorous sphenodontid reptile. Journal of Paleontology, pp.586-597. However this would require propalinal jaw motion. Striations on the wear facets of the teeth can normally be used to determine jaw motion however they are not present on Labidosaurikos was secondary non- dental evidence is required. The ability of the quadrate to slide antero- posteriorly over the articular propaliny however the holotype skull provided by Stovall had damaged the articulating surface. Propaliny is evident two other captorhinids, one called Moradisaurus shares membership in the subfamily Moradisaurinae with Labidosaurikos. The morphology of the articular for Moradisaurus does indicate Labidosaurikos may have been capable of propaliny because articular fragments show great similarity to Moradisaurus than more basal captorhinids. Other osteological evidence for herbivorous feeding via propaliny in Labidosaurikos is vaulted skull roof, a feature that is significantly different from Labidosaurus, Captorhinus, and other more basal captorhinids. This feature is reflected by a posterior expansion of the occipital flange of the squamosal, suggesting muscle fibers originate in the mandible. These muscle fibers would insert into the coronoid process at an angle of 45 degrees to horizontal forming an arrangement that supports the lower jaw being drawn posteriorly thus enabling propaliny. ==Discovery and Classification== The first Labidosaurikos skull was discovered around 1939 in Hennessey shale in Crescent Oklahoma and was presented to John. W Stovall, however he did not name or introduce it to paleontology until 1950 due to his own sickness. To this day this first skull is one of the best-preserved specimens of Labidosaurikos. This initial specimen and species type introduced and named by Stovall was Labidosaurikos meachami for its likeness to Labidosaurus and the species name was a tribute to a Dean at the University of Oklahoma named E.D Meacham. Everett Claire Olson was believed to have discovered a second species of Labidosaurikos, L. barkeri, in 1949 in the upper layer of the Clear Fork Group or the \\"Choza Formation\\" in North Texas. L. barkeri differs from L. meachami in having one less row of teeth in both maxillary and dentary, however, the validity of its classification critiqued in 1959 by R. J. Seltin who thought the size difference between specimens may indicate that the tooth row disparity was an age related developmental difference.R. J. Seltin.1959. A review of the family Captorhinidae. Fieldiana Geology, 10, pp.461-509. In 1988 R.L Carol designated parent taxa as identified as Captorhinidae.Carroll, R.L., 1988. Vertebrate paleontology and evolution. Freeman. The classification of Labidosaurikos has had some discrepancy based on the debate of multiple rowed teeth having evolved twice or once independently. Cladistics analysis of the relationships of Captorhinids originally placed all the large multi-row toothed members in a monophyletic group with Captorhinus aguti based solely on dentition as it also shared multi-rowed teeth ideal for herbivory.Gaffney, E.S. and McKenna, M.C., 1979. A late Permian captorhinid from Rhodesia. American Museum Novitates; no. 2688. More derived captorhinids are usually larger than the more basal groups and this drove the hypothesis that multi row captorhinids were monophyletic group. However more recent complete analysis of cranial anatomy of Labidosaurikos in 1995 revealed that in addition to being more similar in size to Labidosaurus than Captorhinus, there was striking cranial similarity including but not limited to synapomorphies such as the narrow snout, long and narrow anterior process of the frontal. In combination with another single rowed Captorhinus, Eocaptorhinus that was only distinguishable from Captorhinus aguti by the presence single row of teeth.Heaton, M.J. and Reisz, R.R., 1980. A skeletal reconstruction of the Early Permian captorhinid reptile Eocaptorhinus laticeps (Williston). Journal of Paleontology, pp.136-143. New cladistics analysis given this information supported the hypothesis that origin of multiple-tooth-rows in Captorhinidae is diphyletic and that Labidosaurikos is more closely related to single row Labidosaurus than Captorhinus aguti. ==References== Category:Captorhinids Category:Prehistoric reptile genera Category:Permian reptiles of North America Category:Fossils of the United States Category:Fossil taxa described in 1950 ","title":"Labidosaurikos"},{"id":"19304953","text":"The League for Democracy Party (LDP; ) is a Cambodian political party which was formed on 15 July 2005.

Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 32, 449. Descending from one of the first therapsids, biarmosuchus, Paraburnetia evolved prominent canine teeth, a long zygomatic process that extends under the orbit, and shorter phalanges with fewer joints that the lizard-like pelycosaurs. They were small to medium in sized carnivores. Burnetiamorphs distinguished themselves from the basal forms of Biarmosuchians by developing bumpy knobs on their skulls, specifically towards the posterior of the skull and on the nasal. ==History and discovery== Paraburnetia was first discovered by a team from the South African Museum working in the southern Karoo Basin during July 2000. The specimen had been separated into two large portions. The first of which was originally identified due to the 'knob' on the synapsid skull. The snout was found downstream in the lower Beau-fort Group.

Paraburnetia and Proburnetia share features indicating a sister-taxon relationship, including the presence of a well-developed median nasal crest and tall superior orbital bosses Distinctive characteristics that characterize it as a Burnetiamorph are its: \\"triangular supraorbital bosses; ridgelike nasal and frontal crests; bosses on the suborbital bar;swollen knob on the squamosal lateral to the quadrate;small incisors; and thickened rim along the posterior margin of the squamosal\\". ===Skull=== In dorsal view, size of the skull is more similar to those of Bullacephalus, Burnetia, and Proburnetia, than the slightly smaller skull size of Lemurosaurus or Lobalopex. The skull roof is triangular in dorsal view, with the width of the skull roof being narrower than its length. The specimen's skull measures a length of 175 mm. Additionally, the skull appears higher than the skull of Burnetia or Lobalopexdue due to the level of its preservation lacking dorsalventral compression. As shared by many basal therapsids (e.g., dinocephalians, anomodonts), the maxilla in Paraburnetia contacts the prefrontal. In Paraburnetia, the maxilla stretches posterioraly and extends to meet the squamosal. This is different from the situation reported by for Proburnetia, sister taxa to Paraburnetia,Rubidge, B.

There are four postcaniniforms in the left maxilla and five postcaniniforms in the right maxilla. This differs from the seven postcaniniforms that probernetia have. The premaxilla, that make up the tip of the snout, is relatively short and has five small teeth. Additionally, the nasal dorsal surface is a thickened, median boss. This is similarly present in Proburnetia, but more pronounced. All burnetiamorphs except Lemurosaurus possess a median nasal boss. In dorsal view, the frontal crest is prominent in Paraburnetia more so than in Proburnetia. It flattens and broadens until it reaches the interorbital region. The squamosal appears thickened along the posterior border with the tabular.Day, M. O., Smith, R. M., Benoit, J., Fernandez, V., & Rubidge, B. S. (2018). A new species of burnetiid (Therapsida, Burnetiamorpha) from the early Wuchiapingian of South Africa and implications for the evolutionary ecology of the family Burnetiidae. Papers in Palaeontology, 4(3), 453-475. The supraorbital boss shape varies among burnetiamorphs. Basal forms such as Lemurosaurus and Lobalopex have the primitive condition of having a single supraorbital boss. Paraburnetia and Proburnetia have this variation. Whereas Bullacephalus and Burnetia show the derived variation in which the supraorbital boss comprises two separate swellings and a valley between. Sidor, C. A., Hopson, J. A., & Keyser, A. W. (2004). A new burnetiamorph therapsid from the Teekloof Formation, Permian, of South Africa. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 24(4), 938-950. Paraburnetia lack the prominent anterior dorsal orbital depression in the fossa as seen in Bullacephalus, Burnetia, and Proburnetia. The prominent 'knobs' that are supratemporal are created primarily by squamosal and parietal. Unique among burnetiamorphs, the supratemporal 'knob' extends dorsally. The Parietal foramen is thickened to crease a large swelling bump. ===Palate=== The most notable and distinct characteristic of the palate is that the elongated palatine part of the palatinepterygoidis relative to Proburnetia. In Bullacephalus, the pterygoid and palatine flare combined together is very wide. This is in contrast to the narrow flare shown by Burnetia and Proburnetia. As shared by burnetia, labalopex, and proburnetia, paraburnetia lack teeth on the pterygoid that has expanded laterally. ===Lower Jaw=== In lateral view, the lower jaw has a long, dentary that provides most of the lateral surface. Near the coronoid, the dorsal rim swells and thickens, as in other biarmosuchians. Four large incisiform teeth are present on either side of the lower jaw, while an additional small one is present adjacent to the midline. This small incisiform is much shorter than the rest and appears to be a replacement tooth that is not yet fully erupted. The coronoid element is a flat, triangular element, which differs from other biarmosuchians coronoid element shape. Paraburnetia have large reflected lamina and the angular has the same ridge structure as Lemurosaurus and Lobalopex. ==Biostratigraphic History== A simplified geological map of the outcrops of Karoo Supergroup rocks in Southern Africa. The Beaufort Group is represented by the yellow key on the map. Burnetiamorph biostratigraphic overlap in Beaufort Group of South Africa is extremely rare.Sidor, C. A. (2015). The first biarmosuchian from the upper Madumabisa Mudstone Formation (Luangwa Basin) of Zambia. Palaeontologia africana, 49, 1-7. The single event of overlap was the discovory of Lemurosaurus and Paraburnetia. The Beaufort Group is mudrock, with thick layers of multiculored siltstone underneath. Smith, R. M. H. 1987. Morphology and depositional history of exhumed Permian point-bars in the southwestern Karoo, South Africa. Journal Sedimentary Petrology 57:19‚Äì29. Floodplains are connected with rivers. Although the Beaufort Group is now semi-desert, it has been hypothesized to have had forests historically and been cold since it was near the arctic in the time of Pangea. The Beaufort group is known for dicynodontia fossils and there are many co-occurrences of burnetiamorphs found near other dicynodonts. The co-occurrence of the two burnetiamorphs appeared in the Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone. In 1838, Andrew Geddes Bain was first to discover fossil reptiles in the Beaufort Zone.Rubidge, B. S. (1990). A new vertebrate biozone at the base of the Beaufort Group, Karoo Sequence (South Africa). The Beaufort Group has become famous for Permian and Triassic fossils found and has since been subdivided into sub-zones based on biostratigraphy. The third zone, of six zones, suggested by Broom BROOM, R. 1907. On some new fossil reptiles from the Karoo beds of the Victoria West, South Africa. Trans. S. Afr. Phil. Soc.,18: 31-42. being Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone. Biarmosuchian fossils are rare, with only thirty specimens currently discovered. Of 3,755 fossils found from the Cistecephalus AZ, only four are biarmosuchians. Due to the lack of stratigraphic co-occurrence, burnetiamorphs most likely have a wide distribution on Pangea. Evidence of this wide distribution is supported by the findings in collecting areas in Russia and South Africa. Despite burnetiid species occurrences being rare and discovered from different zones, the family was species-rich, with one specimen per genus, suggesting that they had high rates of speciation and extinction.

D., & Schmitz, L. (2014). Nocturnality in synapsids predates the origin of mammals by. Biarmosuchians are typically considered the most basal major lineage of therapsids. Biarmosuchia consists of a paraphyletic series of basal biarmosuchians that are fairly typical early therapsids, and the derived clade Burnetiamorpha, characterized by skulls ornamented by horns and bosses. The close morphological similarity between Paraburnetia and Proburnetia indicates that there was faunal interaction between their zones in early Wuchiapingian. On the geological timescale, Wuchiapingian was a stage of the Permian. Gradstein, F. M.; Ogg, J. G. & Smith, A. G.; 2004: A Geologic Time Scale 2004, Cambridge University Press Additionally, an analysis of the phylogenetic relationships showed that Burnetia, Bullacephalus, Niuksenitia, Paraburnetia, and Proburnetia are within clade Burnetiidae. Within Burnetiidae, Proburnetia and Paraburnetia are sister taxa and Lemurosaurus is the most basal burnetiamorph. Lobalopex (fourth) and relatives ==Paleobiology== Due to retrieving only the skull of the paraburnetia specimen and the other Burnetiidae, there is little information on their entire body morphology. However, knowledge of carnivorous traits and widespread dispersal of burnetiidae occurrences follows the pattern that carnivore species decrease in density near the edge of their ranges as a result of their environment resources not being able to support as many. BROWN, J. H. 1984. On the relationship between abundance and distribution of species. The American Naturalist, 124, 255‚Äì279 Therefore, burnetiamorphs populations for a given area were inevitably lower than for herbivores living in the same region.P ET ERS, R. H. and WASS EN B ERG, K. 1983. The effect of body size on animal abundance. Oecologia, 60 (1), 89‚Äì96. This indicates that burnetiamorph species in the Karoo Basin were a result of the land being on the edge of their territory range, in which case same species should be found in adjacent regions, but not the same regions. == Recent Discoveries and Implications == The new finding of sister taxa Lende chiweta indicates that Africa may have been a migration corridor between the southern and northern parts of Pangea during the late Permian.

It was originally built as a Byzantine church and was converted into a mosque during the early Islamic era. The Crusaders transformed it into a church in the 11th century, but it was reconsecrated as a mosque by the Ayyubids in the 12th century. The mosque is located at the intersection of the main streets of the Old City, along the district's eastern edges.Places to Visit General Mission of Palestine-Tokyo. It has a long, narrow, rectangular floor plan and a silver dome.Semplici, Andrea and Boccia, Mario. - Nablus, At the Foot of the Holy Mountain Med Cooperation, pp.15-16. Inside the mosque ==History== Local legend in Nablus claims that mosque was the site where Jacob's sons handed Jacob the blood-stained coat of their brother Joseph as evidence that his favorite son was dead. This tradition is more associated with the nearby al-Khadra Mosque, however. The site of the Great Mosque was originally a basilica built during the reign of Philip the Arab in 244-249 CE. The Byzantines later constructed a cathedral on the basilica's ruins and this cathedral is depicted in the mosaic Map of Madaba in 600 CE.Pringle, 1998, p. 97 It was likely damaged or destroyed by the Samaritans during their raids in 484 and 529, but Emperor Justinian I (reigned from 483-565) had the cathedral restored.Pringle, 1998, p. 98 The cathedral was transformed into the Great Mosque of Nablus in the early period of Islamic Arab rule in Palestine, in the 10th-century.Dumper, Stanley and Abu-Lughod, 2007, p.266. Arab geographer al- Muqaddasi wrote that the Great Mosque was in the ‚Äúmidst‚Äù of Nablus, and ‚Äúis very finely paved.‚Äùal-Muqaddasi quoted in le Strange, 1890, p.511. The Crusaders reconverted the mosque into a church, but made only few alterations including the construction of an apse. In 1187, the Ayyubids led by Saladin converted the building as a mosque again. The building was burned down by the Knights Templar in the sack of the city of 30 October 1242. A new building was present by the end of the 13th century, as evidenced by Arab chronicler al- Dimashqi who, in 1300, mentions the Great Mosque as ‚Äúa fine mosque, in which is prayer is said, and the Qur'an recited day and night, men being appointed thereto.‚Äùal-Dimashqi quoted in le Strange, 1890, p.513. In 1335, Western traveler James of Verona recorded that the mosque had been ‚Äúa church of the Christians but now is a mosque of the Saracens.‚Äù Twenty years later, Ibn Batuta visited it and noted that in the middle of the mosque was a ‚Äútank of sweet water.‚ÄùIbn Batuta quoted in le Strange, 1890, p.514.

She claimed that her adoptive parents, Edwin and Nancy Johnson, physically abused her as a child and that she made a suicidal gesture during puberty. At age 17, Johnson became pregnant and gave birth to twins, Jennifer and Kristina, with first husband Craig Bratcher. After their divorce, she lost custody of her daughters. Johnson married twice more before meeting Steven Beard while she was a waitress at a country club in Austin, Texas. Beard, a retired Fox Broadcasting executive and self-made multi-millionaire more than twice her age, was a widower whose wife had died of cancer. Johnson moved in with Beard after he convinced her that he would help her regain custody of her daughters. After winning the case, they began dating in secret (with Johnson pretending to be Beard's housekeeper) until his daughter discovered them in a hotel room during the 1993 Super Bowl. They were married on February 18, 1995, with Beard's family and friends suspicious that Johnson had married him for his money. ==Crime== On October 2, 1999, Beard was shot in the stomach while he was asleep, at his home near Jollyville. Beard was later released from the hospital, but succumbed to a blood clot on January 22, 2000. Local police tied the shooting to Tracey Tarlton, who Johnson had met at Saint David‚Äôs Pavilion, a mental health facility, after Johnson threatened to commit suicide when she began fighting with Beard over her lavish spending. Tarlton, arrested at home six days after the shooting, was charged with assault. The police began to hear that Johnson had spoken negatively about Beard. She refused to let them interview him while he was hospitalized, behaved inappropriately after his death, and had slept in a different room the night he was shot. Despite mounting suspicion of a lesbian relationship between Johnson and Tarlton, the latter remained silent until July 2000, when she read in a local newspaper that Johnson had remarried six months after Beard‚Äôs death and realized that their relationship was a sham. Shortly before her murder trial began in March 2002, Tarlton told police that Johnson had persuaded her to shoot Beard; Johnson claimed that Beard had emotionally abused her to the point of suicide, and getting rid of him was the only way the women could be together. ==Trial== Based on Tarlton's statement, Johnson was arrested on March 28, 2002. At Johnson's trial, prosecutors charged that she had married Beard for his money and wanted him dead because he was tired of her extravagant spending and was considering divorce. According to Beard's accountant, Johnson spent $321,000 in October and November 1999, an additional $249,000 by December 10 and another $100,000 in the six weeks ending March 31, 2000. Prosecutors alleged that Johnson had never loved Beard because of their age difference and his obesity. She had a hostile relationship with her daughters, who claimed to have heard their mother make threats against Beard. A friend of Johnson claimed that she had hired her a month after Beard's death to kill Tarlton and cover up her crime. Other witnesses testified that they saw Tarlton and Johnson flirting and behaving affectionately, demonstrating Johnson's manipulative personality. Johnson's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, alleged that she had nothing to do with the shooting and that Tarlton (whom he dismissed as an unreliable witness due to mental instability) acted alone; Tarlton was obsessed with Johnson, who denied making sexual advances toward her. According to Johnson, Tarlton tried to kiss her after she had passed out during her daughters' 1999 high school graduation. When Tarlton was arrested for drunk driving and Johnson bailed her out, Beard (angered by photos of Johnson and Tarlton together) demanded that Tarlton stop contacting the couple. Several witnesses saw no problems in Johnson and Beard's marriage, and DeGuerin alleged that Johnson's daughters lied on the witness stand because they would inherit less money if their mother was acquitted. In 2003, Johnson was convicted of capital murder, receiving a mandatory life sentence. She will be eligible for parole on April 1, 2042. Johnson continues to maintain her innocence and , is imprisoned at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Christina Melton Crain Unit in Gatesville.\\"Johnson, Celeste Beard \\" (Archive).

Abrikosov graduated from the 5th Moscow Gymnasium and historical-philological faculty of Moscow University, and also studied at Oxford. In 1905, he married his cousin Anna Abrikosova. For five years the couple traveled in Europe, where they became seriously interested in Catholicism. ==Conversion to Catholicism== In 1908, Anna Abrikosova converted to Catholicism and a year later, Vladimir. In 1910, Abrikosov returned to Russia. In his apartment in Moscow, they organized meetings of intellectuals, speaking to them on religious subjects and material support for poor Catholic children. Abrikosov's apartment was at that time one of the main centers for the dissemination of Catholic ideas in Moscow. In 1913, the couple were accepted into the novitiate of the Third Order of the Dominicans, in the same year, during a trip to Rome, they took vows and became members of the Order, and had an audience with Pope Pius X. In Russia Abrikosov practised in the Latin rite, intending to revert to the Byzantine rite when it had developed sufficiently in Russia. ==Ordination as a Catholic priest== On 29 May 1917, Vladimir Abrikosov took part in the Council of the Russian Greek Catholic Church and was ordained a Catholic priest of the Byzantine rite by Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. In the same year Sheptytsky appointed him rector of the Moscow Greek Catholic parish and head of the Moscow Dominicans. ==Arrest and expulsion from Russia== In 1920‚Äì1922 in the Abrikosovs' house dialogue took place between representatives of the Catholic and Orthodox churches, which was attended by Moscow intellectuals. Under the influence of Abrikosov in particular, Dmitriy Kuz'min-Karavaev converted to Catholicism. Such activity was considered counterrevolutionary and on 17 August 1922, Vladimir Abrikosov was arrested and sentenced to death, but the punishment was subsequently commuted to perpetual exile. On 29 September of the same year, Abrikosov was expelled from Russia by philosophers' ship, together with the 150 of the most prominent Russian intellectuals. ==Exile== Abrikosov built up contacts with various representatives of the Russian emigre community, organized in Rome a Committee of Russian Catholics, and kept the Holy See constantly informed as to the persecution of Catholics in Soviet Russia, among whom was his wife. In 1922 Abrikosov obtained an audience with Pope Pius XI to discuss the situation of the Russian Catholic Church. Soon after, Abrikosov was named Procurator of the Russian Exarchate by Mgr. Jules Tibirghien, an official of the Congregation for Eastern Churches. However, Abrikosov faced accusations of being a Russian spy by a Russian officer, Baron Igor von der Launitz. He also faced strong opposition from Bishop Michel d'Herbigny who wanted Abrikosov to resign his position as Procurator, and conflicts with the Jesuits. Abrikosov left Rome to establish himself in Paris, when it was rumoured that D'Herbigny intended to abolish the Exarchate. ==Death== In the last years of his life, Abrikosov withdrew from contacts with the Russian √©migr√© community, and lived in solitude. He died on 22 July 1966. ==References * http://rumkatkilise.org/necplus.htm * https://web.archive.org/web/20091226165817/http://vselenstvo.narod.ru/library/histdest.htm Category:1880 births Category:Converts to Eastern Catholicism from Eastern Orthodoxy Category:Former Russian Orthodox Christians Category:Russian Eastern Catholics Category:1966 deaths Category:White Russian emigrants to Italy Category:White Russian emigrants to France Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to Italy Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to France Category:Imperial Moscow University alumni ","title":"Vladimir Abrikosov"},{"id":"19305104","text":"The village of Iroul√©guy and vineyards Iroul√©guy AOC wines (, ) come from Lower Navarre in the Northern Basque Country, France and are usually considered as part of the wine region of South West France (Sud-Ouest).

Currently about 550,000 litres are produced annually, with about 70% of production being red wines, 20% ros√© and 10% white. ==History== The history of wine-making in the area goes back to at least the 3rd century when the Romans commented on wine-making in the area. It was boosted by monks of the Abbey of Roncesvalles in the 11th century who planted the first large scale vineyards to provide wine for pilgrims travelling along the Way of St James.Facaros, D & Pauls, M Bilbao and the Basque Lands Cadoganguides 2003 Following the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, the monks had to give up wine-making and the vineyards which were taken over by the local villagers. During its peak in the 17th century, the Iroul√©guy vineyards comprised some 500 ha of cultivated land. The production of wine had been boosted considerably by the then Viscount of Urdos who encouraged the locals to grow grapes even on the steep slopes. The 18th century saw relatively high levels of employment in the area due to increased mining activity, further boosting the consumption and thus production of local wine. But the following period was marked by constant decline and the vineyards were hit hard by the Great French Wine Blight in 1912 and by the 1980s, only some 70ha were still in cultivation. A cooperative was formed in 1952 under the lead of Alexander Bergouignan to rescue the situation and to work towards certification. The wines of Baigorri, Anhauze and Iroul√©guy were awarded AOVDQS certification in 1953 and Iroul√©guy was granted AOC status in October 1970. Today, some 210ha of land are cultivated again in the area. Prior to AOC certification, a much larger number of varieties were grown, including Kroxenta, Pikapota, Kamalua, Mantzinga, Bordalesa, Erre Mantxaua and Pino beltza.Arbelbide, X. Ikasbil. Retrieved 13 September 2008. ==Location== Of the 15 wine-growing municipalities in the Iroul√©guy region, only the following nine grow Iroul√©guy vines on a total of 210ha: Anhaux, Saint-√âtienne-de- Ba√Øgorry, Ascarat, Iroul√©guy, Bidarrai, Ispoure, Jaxu and Saint- Martin-d'Arrossa. The other municipalities (Aincille, Bussunarits- Sarrasquette, Bustince-Iriberry, Lasse, Lecumberry, Oss√®s, Saint-Jean-le- Vieux) grow other vines. The vineyards are often located on extremely steep slopes with inclines of up to 60¬∞. This has led to the development of special growing and terracing techniques by Basque wine-growers to enable the cultivation of vines on these slopes. ==Wine== Basque Country Red grape varieties include Bordelesa Beltza (Tannat), Axeria (Cabernet Franc) and Axeria Handia (Cabernet Sauvignon), while white wines are made from Xuri Zerratia (Courbu), Izkiriota Ttipia (Petit Manseng) and Izkiriota (Gros Manseng).Stevenson, Tom, The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia, Dorling Kindersley 2005 Garaizabal Pildain, M.

He was also a competent musician (trombone), author of an history of American jazz, and long-time contributor to Saturday Review (1940s, 1950s, 1960s) magazine. Also, he served on the planning committee of the Institute of Jazz Studies. ==LifeEarly years=== Born in 1906, Hobson attended Yale University. There, he was a roommate of Dwight Macdonald, with whom he produced campus humor magazine The Yale Record.Osborn, Robert C. (1982). Osborn on Osborn. New York. Ticknor & Fields. p. 44. He was a 1928 member of Scroll and Key. Famed American documentary photographer Walker Evans captured Hobson and Agee on a Long Island beach during the summer of 1937, when Evans and Agee were visiting Hobson and his first wife Peggy. (The Metropolitan Museum of Art houses those photos, which are also available online‚Äîsee \\"Images,\\" below.) ===Magazines=== Hobson wrote for Time in the 1930s and 1940s. After covering a coal strike during the 1930s, he helped lead unionization at Time and became the first head of Time's Newspaper Guild branch. In October 1942, Hobson succeeded the late Calvin Fixx as assistant editor to Whittaker Chambers, then editor of Arts & Entertainment. Other writers working for Chambers included: novelist Nigel Dennis, future New York Times Book Review editor Harvey Breit, and poets Howard Moss and Weldon Kees. Hobson worked amidst the struggle between Soviet-sympathizing and anti- Communist staffers at Time. Chambers and Willi Schlamm led the anti-Communist camp (and both later joined the founding editorial board of William F. Buckley, Jr.'s National Review). Theodore H. White and Richard Lauterbach led the pro-Soviet camp. Time founder Henry R. Luce came to support the anti- Communist camp before the end of World War II in 1945. Hobson, however, rode out the storm and even managed to write two books at Time: a historical study called American Jazz Music (1939‚Äîsee \\"Music,\\" below) and a novel called All Summer Long (1945). When Chambers received a promotion to senior editor in September 1943 and then joined Time's senior editorial group in December 1932, Hobson succeeded to the Arts & Entertainment section. He hired friend Walker Evans to write reviews first on Film and then on Art (1943‚Äì1945). In 1946, Hobson moved to editorial board of Fortune, where he worked until severe writer's block caused him to resign. In November 1950, Hobson became managing editor of Harper's Bazaar (then with a circulation of 340,605), replacing Frances MacFadden, who retired after 18 years in that position. Later, Hobson joined Newsweek, where he worked for a decade. Hobson become a contributor to the (now defunct) Saturday Review during the late 1940s, the 1950s, and into the 1960s. ===Later life with Verna Hobson=== Hobson was a heavy alcoholic and died at the age of 58 in 1964 of gastrointestinal hemorrhage in Princeton, New Jersey. Hobson married his second wife, Verna Harrison (1923‚Äì2004), in the mid-1940s after meeting at Time. At first they lived in Manhattan but moved to Princeton. Each year, they summered on Squirrel Island, Maine while playing in the Hennessy Five Star Orchestra. Mrs. Hobson worked 1954-1966 as secretary to Robert Oppenheimer, then director of the Institute for Advanced Study. After her husband's death in 1964, she moved to London and worked first for the American Association of University Women and then for the London branch of Robert Matthew, Johnson-Marshall, architects. In 1976, she returned to America and settled in New Gloucester, Maine, working for the independent weekly New Gloucester News and also helping to re-establish The Squirrel Island Squid. In 1998, she became a photographic stringer for The Lewiston Sun. In 2001, she moved to New Rochelle, New York, to live with her son Archie's family. Verna Harrison Hobson died on April 13, 2004. ===Music=== In 1939, Hobson became the second American to write a major book on jazz, American Jazz Music ( A year earlier, colleague Winthrop Sargeant, a staff writer at Life, had published Jazz‚ÄîHot and Hybrid). Sargeant believed that the \\"swing\\" in jazz derived from complex African multi-rhythms adapted to relatively simple Western music. Hobson and Sargeant‚Äîboth amateur, though well informed, jazz enthusiasts‚Äîbelieved that jazz came from New Orleans bordellos, whereas in the 1930s European scholars like Robert Goffin of Belgium and Hugues Panassi√© of France had already ascribed (correctly) that jazz was a \\"vernacular-based art.\\" Wilder's close ancestors were Maine \\"Downeasters\\" and he played summers on Squirrel Island in Southport with the Hennessy Five-Star Orchestra, which slide-trombonist Wilder joined in 1921 at age 15. Wilder's second wife Verna later became a tuba player. Family members still return, where, as of 2001, the Hennessy band was \\"still alive and well.\\" Daughter Eliza Hobson became a jazz disc jockey and broadcast journalist as well as playing piano and guitar. A biography of Time colleague Weldon Kees includes a reminiscence of Kees on piano and Hobson on trombone in the Greenwich Village home of James Agee's sister. ==PublicationsBooks=== * American Jazz Music.

Base running is a tactical part of the game with the goal of eventually reaching home base (home plate) to score a run. Batters strive to become base runners, and to enable existing base runners to move to a subsequent base or to score. ==Becoming a runner== A batter becomes a base runner when one of the following happens: * He hits the baseball into fair territory and is not put out, * He hits into a fielder's choice, * The defensive team commits an error that allows him to reach base, * There is an uncaught third strike, * He receives a base on balls, * He is hit by a pitch, or * A fielder (typically, the catcher) interferes with him. ===The batter- runner=== The Official Baseball Rules uses the term batter-runner to identify the batter from the time he becomes a base runner until the end of the same play, whether he is successful at legally attaining first base or any subsequent base. The term is not applied if the batter is awarded first base (the last three items in the above list). ===Ceasing to be a runner=== A player ceases to be a base runner when: * He scores a run, * He is put out in any way, or * A teammate is put out for the third out of the inning. If a base runner's teammate is put out for the third out of the inning, the base runner is said to be left on base (LOB). ==Running the bases== Pick-off attempt on runner (in red) at first base A runner who is touching a base which he is entitled to occupy may not be tagged out. Runners may attempt to advance from base to base on any fair ball that touches the ground. When a ball is hit in the air (i.e., a fly ball) and caught by the defending team, runners must return and touch the base they occupy--called tagging up--after the ball is first touched by a fielder. Once they do this, they may attempt to advance at their own risk. On a ball that touches the ground in fair territory, if there is a force, runners are required to run. Base runners may attempt to advance at any time while the ball is alive, even before or while the pitcher is throwing a pitch. The catcher--or pitcher, in lieu of delivering the pitch-- often tries to prevent this by throwing the ball to one of the infielders in order to tag the runner. This pick-off attempt is usually unsuccessful in tagging out the runner but is effective in keeping the runner closer to the base. If the runner is tagged out while diving back to the base, it is called a pickoff. If the runner attempts to advance to the next base but is tagged out before reaching it safely, he is caught stealing. A successful attempt by the runner is called a stolen base. If a pitch gets away from the catcher, runners may also try to advance. This may be a wild pitch, if the pitcher is held responsible for the ball getting away, or a passed ball if the catcher is deemed to be at fault. Sometimes the defending team will ignore a runner who is trying to steal a base; in this case a runner is not credited with a steal, and the base is attributed to defensive indifference. ==Strategy== An infielder who cleanly fields a ball hit on the ground, then throws it quickly and accurately, will usually get the ball to a base before the runner runs the . However, any hesitation or mistake on the part of the fielder may allow the runner to reach the base safely. Teams scout the opposition and take advantage of players who are poor at defense. For example, on a deep fly ball to center field with a man on second base, if the center fielder has a weak arm, the runner on second base may tag the base and attempt to reach third despite the risks of being tagged out. Base running and hitting are coordinated to produce better results in the squeeze play and the hit and run play. When the count is full and there are two outs, any runners forced to advance begin running as soon as the pitcher's motion obliges him to complete his pitch, as their distance from the base will not be the cause of any third out. Good runners also try to get extra bases when a play is being made at a different base. For example, a batter who hits a single should determine whether the defense's focus on another runner gives the batter a chance to reach second base. Sliding into a base is an important part of base running. The pop-up slide both ensures that the runner touches the base and elevates him to an upright posture to help him take additional bases if the defense misperforms. A take- out slide tries to use a collision with a fielder to keep him from taking additional action, such as throwing to achieve a double play. However, this move, when made independently of the attempt to reach the base, has been illegal since 2016 because of the potential for injury. The base coach at third base, and any batter still at home plate, may watch the ball approaching the base and may signal the base runner on the optimum slide to avoid being tagged out. ==See also== *Scoring position ==External links== *Official Rules of Major League Baseball \\"The Runner\\" ==References== Category:Baseball rules Category:Baseball terminology ","title":"Base running"},{"id":"19305201","text":"Khmer Neutral Party is a pluralistic political party in Cambodia ==Political ideology== It believes in promoting a ‚Äúpluralistic political system‚Äù which is a centrist political position where there‚Äôs democracy for people to express their own political views equally.

Lalbai leads the bride to the Shaitani Ilaaka (devil's domain), where she is roused from her spell. The bride is sacrificed, screaming and kicking, at the altar of her aka Shaitan, an ancient and fearsome demon. Years ago, he roamed free and indiscriminately terrorized the local townsfolk. But he was ultimately defeated, reduced to a formless soul, and held, by a magic charm, to remain imprisoned forever within the Shaitani Ilaaka. Lalbai brings him a fresh bride every Amavasya night. Shaitan consumes the blood of this bride, and grows stronger with each offering, until he can break the charm, restore all his evil powers and ravage the world again. A few years later, Anju grows up into a beautiful young girl and is in the final year of her university. Roma notices her girl in love with a decent guy Deepak. He is the only son of an industrialist and is a well-cultured young man. Deepak gets to know of Anju's problem and contacts a tantrik through his parents. The tantrik is none other that yogi baba, dr. Yograj's guru from Tibet. He visits the thakur palace and instantly spots the root of the problem. He asks deepak to remove Anju from there and take her to the famous Pavankhind mandir beyond a mountainous region in the city. He also insists that they leave during the bramhakaal, during which all evil beings are powerless. It lasts for 9 minutes at the break of dawn. All friends come together and hiring a bus, help Anju to wear the bramhakaal taaveez, which tantrik baba himself has purified with the most powerful prayers. Baba warns Anju that she should not remove the taaveez from her neck under any circumstances. Roma leads the kids outside. But Shalaka arrives just then and is outraged at Anju's removal. She steps way out of line and demands to know Anju's whereabouts. Roma refuses and puts her in her place, whereupon Shalaka transforms into a hideous witch, Lalbai, and reveals she has served Shaitan for ages, and when Thakur's ancestors used various magic incantations to defeat Shaitan, she infiltrated Thakur's household as a governess. She hopes to use Anju, the living descendant of Shaitan's enemies, as the final sacrifice to liberate Shaitan. Roma is shocked to find her maid in such a ferocious form and shoots her with a gun. But Lalbai, who is already a possessing evil spirit, pounces on Thakurain and murders her brutally. Deepak and Anju are just crossing the backyard when Lalbai again comes there and tries to stop them. She tells them her real identity and attacks Anju, who falls in the swimming pool. Deepak tries to free her and gets wounded. Just then baba arrives there and imprisons Lalbai, helping them to escape. Deepak and his friends successfully remove Anju to a safe haven away from the city. They take the opportunity for some rest and relaxation. But in the old cafe, local ruffians find the girls at a table and start harassing them. A guy then reaches there and pounds the goons along with Deepak and Abdul, making them flee. He introduces himself as Kamal and befriends the whole group. Reaching the old fortress, they light the diya there and Anju feels a strange peace surrounding her. She gains her happiness back for some time. Baba asks Deepak and Anju to get married there, as Lalbai won't be able to harm Anju after they consummate their pious union. Baba tracks Lalbai to the Shaitani Ilaaka. She now transforms herself into a wild eagle, to protect her remaining powers. He uses his spiritual powers to summon her. When he discovers her intentions with Anju, he swiftly realizes Deepak and Anju must marry and consummate their matrimony as quickly as possible. Deepak and Anju are deeply in love and would marry anyway, they hasten the event and obtain a marriage license with Baba and others as witnesses. But while Deepak's sister is alone in the mandir preparing the flower baskets, the local goons reach there and try to molest her. Just then, the boys reach there and send them packing after breaking their bones. But while they reach the mandir and camp there, many untoward events happen and many of their friends are ruthlessly killed by the Shaitaan. It happens as mostly the boys and girls venture into his lair in the dark, quite unwittingly losing their way. Once the devil even kidnaps Anju on her wedding night as she is bathing, and Lalbai wounds her with a metal pole. Shaitaan gets some of Anju's blood. As Deepak and friends reach there and rescue Anju, they even realise that for now thanks to Lalbai, Shaitaan has become strong enough to be able to leave his lair for a short time. Shaitaan even tracks them down to the stone fortress and attacks the girls there, but is unable to harm them as baba again saves them in the nick of time. Kanwaljit, whose only sister also became one of Lalbai's sacrifice victims, helps them in all ways, but is later killed by Lalbai. Even when baba goes to fight with Lalbai, she weakens his powers by harming his body with a poison and he succumbs to the attack. Due to the chaos in the village, the townsfolk and few eve teasers realise that the girl who got married in the mandir must be offered to the devil in order to quieten him and stop all the carnage. The final confrontation occurs near the village square. People surround the mandir and after taking Anju hostage, tie her to a pillar, to be used as bait for Shaitan. As the growling Shaitan gleefully steps up to exact his vengeance, Deepak breaks free and attacks Shaitan. Shaitan fends him off with a powerful blow that pitches Deepak away. Deepak snatches a trishul (holy trident of Kali), which he finds at the altar. He discovers it repels Shaitan, and ultimately drives it into Shaitan. The powers of Kali, channeled through the trishul, destroy Shaitan and bury him deep into the ground forever. The entire village is relieved by the devil's destruction and is blessed with Matarani's power for ever. ==Cast== *Sri Pradha as Anjali/Anju *Neelam Mehra as Lalbai/Shalaka *Deepak Parashar as Deepak *Surendra Pal as Tantrik Baba *Shamshuddin as Shaithan *Asha Lata as Anju's mother, Roma *Satish Shah as Funtoosh *Kanwaljit Singh as friend *Shehnaz Kudia as Sweety *Sunil Dhawan as Anju's Father ,Thakur ==Music== #\\"Aaj Kahin Door Na Ja\\" - Shobha Joshi, Udit Narayan #\\"Mera Haule Haule\\" - Mohammed Aziz, Anupama Deshpande #\\"Dooba Dooba\\" - Sudesh Bhosle, Udit Narayan, Alka Yagnik #\\"Tanna Na\\" - Bappi Lahiri == External links == * Category:1990 films Category:1990s Hindi-language films Category:Indian films Category:Films scored by Bappi Lahiri Category:Indian horror films ","title":"Shaitani Ilaaka"},{"id":"19305216","text":"James Herbert \\"Jimmie Red\\" Jones (March 14, 1920 - September 1, 2008) was the Arkansas State Auditor from 1956 to 1980 the Adjutant General of the Arkansas National Guard from 1979 to 1981 and 1983 to 1984. ==Early life== Jones was born in Magnolia, Arkansas, where he grew up and attended high school.

After college, Jones attended the University of Arkansas School of Law, and Keegan's School of Radio and Television in Memphis, Tennessee.http://www.guardonline.com/?q=node/47599 Jones had a varied early work career, working as a store clerk, gas station attendant, and a \\"roughnecker\\" and \\"switcher\\" in the oil fields, before moving on to his long career in the military and public service. He was a very devoted son to his mother and during his late 1950ss when she was sick in a nursing home in Magnolia would drive each week the three hours from Little Rock to bring her her favorite dinner and sit with her for an hour or two and then make the long drive home to Little Rock. He developed a reputation for honesty and kindness, part of his political success. While he was State Auditor he drove older cars to conserve state funds and was always humble about his duties as a public servant. ==Military service== Jones first joined the Arkansas National Guard in 1938, but did not enter active service until October 1942. After entering active service he was trained as a bombardier and, at the end of 1943, was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Army Air Corps. He commanded the 93 Bomb Group, and flew thirty combat missions with this group. In 1944 he was promoted to First Lieutenant, and in 1945 he was removed from active duty and put in the Officers Reserve Corps. For his combat service and valor he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross with Oak Leaf Cluster, Air Medal with four Oak Leaf Clusters, Joint Service Medal, European-African Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, five Bronze Stars and the World War II Victory Medal. He served as Commander of The American Legion Department of Arkansas. ===Arkansas National Guard=== Jones joined the Arkansas National Guard at age 18, and remained a member for the rest of his life. He was made Adjutant General of the State National Guard twice after the end of his tenure as State Auditor. The first tenure was from 1979 to 1981, and the second was from 1983 to 1984. His path to becoming the State Commander of the National Guard was long and steady. In 1951, he was promoted to Captain and given responsibilities as the adjutant, communications, and motor officer of the 206 Tank Battalion. He was transferred to the National Guard state headquarters in 1961, where he was promoted to Major and given new duties. In 1967, he was again promoted, this time to Lieutenant Colonel, in which authority he served as State Inspector and Director of Supply and Maintenance, and, in 1971, he was promoted to Colonel. After his promotion to Colonel he transferred to the U.S. Army Reserve Control, where he served until being made Adjutant General. He reached the rank of Major General in this capacity before his retirement. He received the Legion of Merit and the Armed Forces Reserve Medal as awards for his service. ==Political career== Jones's political career began in 1950, with his election to the first of two terms as Columbia County, Arkansas Tax Collector. In the same time period he was a leading organizer in the Magnolia chapters of the Chamber of Commerce, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. During this time he also served as the Southern State College Alumni Association President and other community organizations. Arkansas Governor Francis Cherry appointed Jones as State Lands Commissioner in 1955, a position he served for just over a year, before being elected Arkansas State Auditor in 1956. He was then reelected to 11 two-year terms before retiring in 1978. Jones served as Governor Bill Clinton's campaign manager in his 1982 reelection campaign, and remained a Democratic Activist, including serving as a major fundraiser for Clinton and the State Party. He died in Hot Springs, Arkansas at age 88. ==References== Category:1920 births Category:2008 deaths Category:American football quarterbacks Category:American football linebackers Category:Arkansas Democrats Category:Southern Arkansas Muleriders football players Category:State Auditors of Arkansas Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:United States Army Air Forces officers Category:University of Arkansas School of Law alumni Category:Recipients of the Legion of Merit Category:People from Magnolia, Arkansas Category:Recipients of the Air Medal Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Category:20th-century American politicians Category:Players of American football from Arkansas ","title":"James Herbert Jones"},{"id":"19305218","text":"Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque () is a mosque located in the city of Sayyidah Zaynab, in the southern suburbs of Damascus, Syria.

The Lebanese Hezbollah displays several posters and sets at the shrine. The shrine is dominated by pilgrims until it is closed at 9 pm after the Isha prayer. The majority of the pilgrims are Iranians, Indians, Pakistanis, as well as Kuwaiti, Bahraini, Lebanese, and Iraqi (Shia) Arabs. A community of Afghan refugees who fled from violence in their country now live in the area surrounding the shrine. Sufis also visit the shrine. Prayers are led by Ayatullah Mujtaba Hussaini and Muslims from all ethnic backgrounds can be found praying there. The shrine also has a separate prayer hall for Sunni men where they hold separate Friday prayers.

On 14 June 2012, the town became the target of a suicide car bomb attack where around 14 people were heavily wounded. Since mid-summer 2012, the town has been under attack from armed militants in neighbouring Sunni towns. Many Shia and pro government families were driven out of their homes in southern Damascus and sought refuge in Sayyidah Zaynab. Constant shelling became more frequent in this predominantly Shia town, and rockets landing on random places in the town became common. On 31 January 2016, at least 60 people were killed in three bomb blasts in the Koa sodhda area, near the shrine. At least another 110 people were also wounded in the blasts, caused car bombs. ==See also== * Al- Sayeda Zainab Mosque - A mosque in Cairo, Egypt where is also considered as the place of burial of Sayyida Zainab according to Sunni and Ismaili Shia tradition. * Bab Saghir * Holiest sites in Islam (Shia) * Jannat al-Baqi' * Jannat al-Mu'alla * Sayyidah Ruqayya Mosque ==References External links == * Category:20th-century mosques Category:Architecture of Syria Category:Family of Muhammad Category:Islamic holy places Category:Mausoleums in Syria Category:Shia mosques in Syria Category:Twelvers Category:Tourist attractions in Syria Category:Shia shrines Category:Mosques completed in 1990 ","title":"Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque"},{"id":"19305228","text":"Lestes vigilax, the swamp spreadwing, is a damselfly of the genus Lestes.

Dale Ewell was a United States Air Force veteran turned multi-millionaire businessman who specialized in the sale of small airplanes with his company, Western Piper Sales, Inc. Glee had devoted much of her life to philanthropy and public service, briefly acting as a Spanish translator for the CIA in the 1950s and later holding a seat at the State Bar of California committee that evaluated prospective judges. Ewell's sister Tiffany Ann (b. 1967), a few weeks shy of her 25th birthday at the time of her death, was a graduate student, while Ewell himself had earned a finance degree from Santa Clara University (SCU). Ewell's parents had substantial investments in the stock market and local farmland. Although the family was financially well off, the elder Ewells lived a relatively modest lifestyle and avoided flaunting their wealth, which was estimated at $7‚Äì‚Å†8 million (equivalent to about $12.5 to $14 million in 2017). During Ewell's time at college, he had been attributing his father's accomplishments to himself and was posing as a wealthy entrepreneur when he actually had no such experience. A Santa Clara newspaper and SCU's yearbook both had printed stories on Ewell in 1990, depicting him as \\"a self-made millionaire\\" who was enjoying the luxuries afforded by his nonexistent business success. After learning about Ewell's lies, his parents modified their estate plan. Extended family believed that Dale Ewell planned on ending his financial support for his son after his college graduation, a possible motive for the murders. ==Murder and investigation== Dale, Glee and Tiffany Ewell were murdered on Sunday, April 19, 1992 in their home near Fresno. At the time of the murders, Ewell lived at the family home but was away with his girlfriend for the Easter weekend. The bodies were discovered two days after the murders, when Ewell notified family friends in Sunnyside that he was unable to contact his parents. After the murders, police spent four days at the Ewell home investigating the crime scene. The case was investigated by Fresno County Sheriff's Office homicide detectives John Souza and Chris Curtice. They suspected the killer was hiding in the house waiting for the family to return. Glee Ewell was shot four times while Tiffany and Dale Ewell were each shot once. The murders had seemingly been planned and executed with care, such as when the shooter took discarded shell casings after firing the fatal gunshots. The shooter's aim was good, missing only once while firing multiple shots. A box of 9mm shells, purchased by Dale Ewell in the early 1970s, was found in the home and were believed to have been used to kill the family. The bullets recovered from the victims' bodies showed signs of the gun having been fitted with a homemade silencer.Vincent J. Schodolski. 2 Cops Work 5 Years To Prove Son Had Family Killed. The Chicago Tribune, May 19, 1997. Accessed 10 October 2017 While the home appeared to have been searched for valuables, Souza (with extensive experience investigating burglaries) concluded the scene was staged in an attempt to make the murders appear as if the family had interrupted a thief. Police looked into the victims' background and found possible motives for the crime. In the 1970s, Dale Ewell had sold airplanes for a California man named Frank Lambe who had been convicted for drug smuggling, after which Dale took over the business. Dale Ewell had also been involved in a troubled real estate development deal with his brother Ben, which threatened to cost investors millions in losses. Investigation ruled out these factors as possible motives for the murders. Although Dana Ewell's alibi for his whereabouts at the time of the murders included having spent the Easter weekend with his girlfriend and her family in San Francisco, some 200 miles away, authorities came to focus on him after eliminating other possible culprits. Extended family members, like Ewell's uncle, reported that he was inordinately fixated in the details of his parents' will and testament, and was \\"visibly shaken and angry\\" upon learning he would be unable to access most of his family's wealth until his thirties. His parents' estate plan created a legal trust that locked up most of their assets upon their death. A trustee was required to pay for Ewell's care and expenses until the age of 25, while from 25 to 30 he was to receive dividends from investments, but had no access to the principal. Ewell would receive half the principal at age 30, and the remainder at age 35. However, Ewell was the beneficiary of over $300,000 in life insurance payments which were not subject to trust restrictions or probate court oversight. Joel Patrick Radovcich, a college friend of Ewell, abruptly dropped out of school shortly after the murders and came under suspicion. Ewell was described as being obsessed with money and social status, and Radovcich was preoccupied with guns and explosives. Ewell had come under suspicion only days after the murders when Curtice had walked him through the crime scene and thought his reactions highly unusual, later recalling his impressions as \\"that kid's dirty.\\" Dana and Radovcich attracted additional suspicion by both occupying the Ewell family home only a few weeks after the murders. The pair were reported making many cash purchases such as helicopter flight lessons (despite Radovcich being unemployed) and communicating via a complex system of pagers and pay telephone calls, seemingly designed to avoid being overheard. The police kept Ewell and Radovcich under close surveillance for several months. In one instance, a detective wore a recording device and stood close to Radovcich at a pay phone in May 1993, overhearing him make comments such as \\"they don't have evidence. They will try to catch you in a lie.\\" Forensic analysis found the murder weapon was a high-end 9mm specialty rifle manufactured by Feather Industries in Trinidad, Colorado. Company records showed one such rifle had been purchased by Ernest Jack Ponce, a friend of the Radovcich family, shortly before the murders. Ponce admitted buying the rifle for Radovcich, but denied knowing it would be used for a crime.Crime and Punishment: Millions of Reasons to Kill, narrated by Bill Kurtis, accessed 14 October 2017 Ponce had further concealed evidence after the murders, making him an accessory. He was granted immunity from prosecution and agreed to testify against Ewell and Radovcich, who were arrested in early 1995. ==Trial and afterwards== Fresno County Assistant District Attorneys James Oppliger and Jeffrey Hammerschmidt prosecuted Ewell and Radovcich in a jury trial which lasted over eight months. Prosecutors argued that Ewell was motivated by greed, and that he promised Radovcich a share of his family's wealth. Ewell and Radovcich were represented by separate attorneys who took different strategies: Ewell's insisting his client was innocent, while Radovcich's believed the evidence was so overwhelming that a guilty verdict was probable and thus his main goal should be avoiding the death penalty. Jurors deliberated for 11 days. Although they considered Ponce's testimony unreliable and suspected he was more involved with the murders than he admitted, they found Ewell and Radovcich both guilty of three counts of first degree murder. The murderers were subject to stricter sentencing due to aggravating circumstances: multiple victims, murder for profit, and lying in wait. Although facing a potential death sentence, both avoided that fate. They were sentenced on July 20, 1998 to life sentences without the possibility of parole. All appeals have been denied. Ewell is in the Protective Housing Unit of California State Prison, Corcoran with other murderers requiring isolation from the general prison population. ==On television== The case is covered in the Forensic Files episode \\"Two in a Million\\" (season 11, episode 40, aired April 18, 2007), The New Detectives episode \\"Family Plots\\" (season 5, episode 9, aired January 25, 2000) and the Dominick Dunne's Power, Privilege, and Justice episode \\"Tailspin\\" (season 3, episode 5, aired September 5, 2003).

Located in the historical region of Southern Dobruja, Durankulak is the north-easternmost inhabited place in Bulgaria and the northernmost village of the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, although the village itself is slightly inland. Durankulak lies north of the town of Shabla, with the only places to the north along the coast being the formerly exclusively Czechoslovak camping site Kosmos and the Kartalburun and Sivriburun headlands. Durankulak is also the name of the nearby border checkpoint on the Bulgarian-Romanian border; just north of the border is the Romanian seaside resort Vama Veche. As of 2008, Durankulak has a population of 471 and the mayor is Zyumbyul Medarov. The village lies at an elevation of 26 metres above mean sea level, on the E87 littoral road, 6 kilometres south of the Romanian border. Durankulak lies 100 km from Varna, 68 km from Dobrich and 60 km from Constan≈£a. The coastal Lake Durankulak is located to the southeast and the Durankulak Swamp or Eagles' Swamp (–û—Ä–ª–æ–≤–æ –±–ª–∞—Ç–æ, Orlovo blato) is to the northeast, towards the Black Sea the two are connected by an artificial but overgrown marshy canal. To the northeast of the village is also the Anna Maria beach that continues up to Sivriburun and the border. There is another beach south of the village which extends to Krapets. The village has a cultural centre (chitalishte) with a big hall and a small hall, a museum of local history, a small art gallery and a library. There are several monuments dedicated to the peasant revolt of 1900 dating to the 1970s and 1980s. The local Bulgarian Orthodox church was built in 1942. ==History== The Durankulak settlement commenced on a small island, approximately 7000 BC and lasted for thousand years. The first inhabitants were the Hamangia culture, dated from the middle of the 6th millennium to the middle of 5th millennium BC, and were the first manifestation of the Neolithic life in Dobruzha. Hamangia people were small-scale cultivators and plant collectors who built houses, made pottery, herded and hunted animals. Around 4700/4600 BC the stone architecture was already in general use and became a characteristic phenomenon that was unique in Europe. The settlement in Durankulak was a well-organized aggregation of buildings of substantial size with several rooms. They were coherently laid out according to a plan that was repeated over successive generations of house reconstructions. Buildings were rectilinear and large, narrow paths separated individual houses, which stood alone or abutted by other buildings. The structures were robust and made of large wooden posts sunk into foundation trenches and joined together with wooden planks or branches covered with mud or clay. In all building horizons, except for in the earliest ones, buildings were internally divided into separate, mainly rectilinear, rooms. Stone structures and bases from the houses are well preserved and there is a cave and some cisterns to see. Durankulak is one of few monuments left from early farming societies in Europe and tell us about daily life. The excavation in Durankulak took part between 1974 and 1997 when 1204 prehistoric burials were carefully recorded and the remains of 17 houses were found.Todorova, H. 2002a.

Durankulak, Band II, die pr√§historischen gr√§berfelder von Durankulak, Teil 2. Berlin-Sofia: Publ. House Anubis. The oldest village at this place was the small village of Kartalii to the northeast of modern Durankulak. It was abandoned in the middle of the 19th century and had around 200‚Äì300 residents, but its location meant the danger of malaria made it unsuitable for living in the summer. Some of the population of Kartalii founded Durankulak, which used to be an Ottoman farm inhabited by a few Bulgarians. The bulk of Durankulak's residents were, however, settlers from the eastern Balkan Mountains who arrived in the early 19th century. After the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, it became part of the Principality of Bulgaria and, as the largest village in the region, was a municipal centre of 12 villages. On 1 June 1900, the village was the centre of an economic revolt against the government of Todor Ivanchov and as a result 40 people (none of them locals) were killed by the national cavalry. Between 1913 and 1940, it was under Romanian rule along with all of Southern Dobruja and was renamed to RƒÉcari, but it was returned to Bulgaria according to the Treaty of Craiova. According to the terms of that treaty, the native Bulgarian population of Northern Dobruja was exchanged with the Romanian and Aromanian colonists sent in the south during the period of Romanian rule. As a result, some Northern Dobrujan Bulgarian refugees (–ø—Ä–µ—Å–µ–ª—Ü–∏, preseltsi) settled in Durankulak. Most of them were from Nunta≈üi not far from the Danube Delta and today form around half of the village's population. From its return to Bulgaria to 1963, the village was known as Blatnitsa (–ë–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–∏—Ü–∞, \\"marshy place\\"), but its historic name was reinstated to commemorate the revolt of 1900. The name is of ancient origin meaning the place where the taurus knocked with his fist (hoof) and gushed water surrounded the two isles in the lake. Its like a legend of the chosen land for ever giving life and prosperity. The barelefs and golden ornamentations of tauruses were found in tracian tombs, romans burial barelefs and in Varna Necropolishttps://www.google.com/search?q=%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8+%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB&client;=firefox-a&hs;=LYd&rls;=org.mozilla:bg:official&channel;=fflb&tbm;=isch&tbo;=u&source;=univ&sa;=X&ei;=XX4GU9SxNaHsywP_n4DQCQ&ved;=0CDAQsAQ&biw;=1366&bih;=638#facrc=_&imgdii;=_&imgrc;=u8t1sUOJzX5BjM%253A%3BCF9asp1G6kok4M%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fvarna.info.bg%252Fnekropol1.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fvarna.info.bg%252Fnekropolis.htm%3B375%3B254 ==Lake Durankulak== The freshwater Lake Durankulak is separated from the Black Sea by sand dunes and a beach strip, it has an area of around 4 square kilometres and features two islands in its western part, the Big Island (0.02 km2) and the Small Island (0.0053 km2). As the habitat of 260 rare and endangered species, the lake is one of the most important and well-preserved coastal wetlands in Bulgaria. Among the important birds in the area are the little bittern, ferruginous duck, mute swan, western marsh harrier, paddyfield warbler. The greater white-fronted goose, red-breasted goose and mallard spend the winter there, and there are large populations of the pygmy cormorant and great white pelican. The lake is also an archaeologically important area. Pithouses of the oldest known inhabitants of Dobruja, dating to 5100‚Äì4700 BC, have been unearthed near the west shore, as well as 3500‚Äì3400 BC mound burials and a Sarmatian necropolis from Late Antiquity. The Big Island of Lake Durankulak is particularly important, as it is the site of an Eneolithic settlement of 4600‚Äì4200 BC, a cultural monument of national importance. The island also features a 1300‚Äì1200 BC fortified settlement, a Hellenistic rock- hewn cave sanctuary of Cybele (3rd century BC) and a Bulgar settlement from the 9th‚Äì10th century AD. Because of its age and importance, the archaeological complex has been dubbed the \\"Bulgarian Troy\\". ==References== * This article is based on a translation of the article \\"–î—É—Ä–∞–Ω–∫—É–ª–∞–∫\\" from the Bulgarian Wikipedia. * * * Category:Villages in Dobrich Province Category:Seaside resorts in Bulgaria Category:Bulgaria‚ÄìRomania border crossings Category:Populated coastal places in Bulgaria Category:Populated places established in the 6th millennium BC Category:Populated places disestablished in the 5th millennium BC Category:Prehistoric sites in Bulgaria Category:History of Dobrich Province ","title":"Durankulak"},{"id":"19305378","text":"A Spin up () is a Ditangquan technique of Wushu similar to the kip up, where the body is lifted from a lying position to a standing position.

Initially, Maynard Mathews wanted to erect a plaque in honour of his son at the Roman Catholic Church in Ladysmith, but could not secure permission to do so. Determined that a memorial to his son should be placed in a church, Maynard decided to build his own, have it consecrated a Catholic church and become a priest himself (he was ordained in the Dominicans on 7 May 1926). The oratory seats just eight people, apparently the same number of people Llandaff saved in the mine accident, and is architecturally based on a wing of Cardiff Cathedral in Wales.

Only a single KZ I was constructed, and it disappeared during the course of World War II. During the 1970s, a flying replica was built, with work started by Gunnar Fjord Christensen in 1972 and sold to the Danmarks Flymuseum in 1977.

For her scientific work, Karle received the Garvan‚ÄìOlin Medal, Gregori Aminoff Prize, Bower Award, National Medal of Science, and the Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Award (which is the Navy's highest form of recognition to civilian employees). ==Early life== Isabella (seated) and Jerome Karle at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, where they worked for many years.Isabella (seated center) and Jerome Karle (left foreground) at their 2009 retirement ceremony She was born as Isabella Helen Lugoski in Detroit, Michigan on December 2, 1921, the daughter of immigrants from Poland. She attended the local public schools, while at school, a female chemistry teacher led her to her pursuit of the field as a career.Staff. \\" profile\\", Journal of Chemical Education. Accessed September 22, 2009. She attended the University of Michigan on full scholarship, where she majored in physical chemistry and received a Bachelor of Science at age 19, followed by Master of Science and Ph.D. degrees in the field. During her graduate work she met her future husband and scientific collaborator Jerome Karle; the two were both advised in their Ph.D. studies by Lawrence Brockway. ==Career== Karle worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II, where she developed techniques to extract plutonium chloride from a mixture containing plutonium oxide. She joined the United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) after the end of the war. At the NRL, her husband Jerome developed \\"direct methods\\" for analyzing structure of crystals. However, for many years the crystallographic community remained skeptical about their utility. Isabella Karle was the first person to apply the method. She developed the symbolic addition procedure that connects the theoretical \\"direct method\\" apparatus and actual X-ray diffraction data. These contributions advanced the field of X-ray crystallography by enabling determination of the structure of crystals. This technique has played a major role in the development of new pharmaceutical products and other synthesized materials. In 1985, Jerome Karle was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, together with mathematician Herbert A. Hauptman, for developing direct methods for analyzing X-ray diffraction data. Jerome Karle and many other members of the crystallography community strongly believed that Isabella Karle should have shared the prize. Karle received many honors. She was elected a Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences (1978) and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1993). In addition, she received the National Medal of Science (1995), various awards, and eight honorary doctorates. On July 31, 2009, Karle and her husband retired from the Naval Research Laboratory, after a combined 127 years of service to the United States Government, with Karle joining the NRL in 1946, two years after her husband. Retirement ceremonies for the Karles were attended by United States Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, who presented the couple with the Department of the Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Award, the Navy's highest form of recognition to civilian employees.McKinney, Donna. \\"Jerome and Isabella Karle Retire from NRL Following Six Decades of Scientific Exploration\\" , United States Naval Research Laboratory press release dated July 21, 2009.

Fletcher was born and raised in Birkenhead, England, and attended St Hughes Roman Catholic secondary school. As he was about to escape to a sixth-form place at St Anselm's college, owned and run by the Irish Christian Brothers, he lost his best childhood friend, Dessie, to a drug overdose. He felt the event marked a transition from boy to adult, and announced his intention to become a monk. In 1988, while still a Christian Brother, he went to study theology at Durham University. He left the order shortly before taking his final vows, disillusioned by the restrictions increasingly placed upon the social work of the Brothers in Liverpool. Later, he returned to Durham University for a Masters in systematic philosophy and subsequently a PhD. In 1997, he was appointed as a lecturer in religious studies at Lancaster University, where he remained until his death in 2008. Fletcher's influence in modern philosophy has been affirmed by some of the top speakers in British philosophy and his controversial ideas in applied ethics have been cited as having influenced some of the more radical modern philosophical approaches. ==References== *Obituary at The Guardian Category:Alumni of Durham University Category:1965 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Academics of Lancaster University ","title":"Paul Fletcher (theologian)"},{"id":"19305504","text":"Waldemar Kita (born 1953 in Szczecin, Poland) is a Polish millionaire businessman residing in France.Waldemar Kita s'offre le FC Nantes, Boursier.com et Reuters, published 28 July 2007, retrieved on 10 June 2009. ==Optics== Kita made his fortune by establishing Corn√©al in 1986.

The loss of the aircraft along with that of BSAA Avro Tudor Star Ariel in 1949 remains unsolved, with the resulting speculation helping to develop the Bermuda Triangle legend. ==Background== British South American Airways (BSAA) was an airline created by former World War II pilots in an effort to provide service on the previously untapped South American trade and passenger routes. Originally named British Latin American Air Lines (BLAIR) it was split off from the British Overseas Airways Corporation to operate its South Atlantic routes. It commenced transatlantic services in March 1946, with a BSAA Avro Lancastrian making the first operational flight from London's Heathrow Airport. The airline operated mostly Avro aircraft: Yorks, Lancastrians and Tudors, and flew to Bermuda, the West Indies and the western coast of South America. ==Flight== Star Tiger was one of three enlarged and improved versions of the Avro Tudor, designated Tudor IV; it had made 11 transatlantic flights, a total of 575 hours flying time, since its initial test flight on 4 November 1947. On the morning of 28 January 1948, the crew and passengers boarded Star Tiger at Lisbon only to be forced to return to the airport waiting room when the pilot, Captain Brian W. McMillan, told them that the port inner engine needed some attention. The aircraft took off 2 hours later, and made what was intended to be a 75-minute refuelling stop at Santa Maria in the Azores. However, the reported weather was so poor that Captain McMillan decided they should stop over until the next day. The following day, 29 January, Star Tiger took off for the next leg of its flight to Bermuda despite strong winds. McMillan had decided to fly at no more than so as to avoid the worst winds. An Avro Lancastrian belonging to BSAA piloted by Frank Griffin took off an hour ahead of the Star Tiger, and Griffin had agreed to radio weather information back to Star Tiger. Star Tiger took off at 15:34 and soon after takeoff was lashed by heavy rain and strong winds. At first some 200 miles behind the Lancastrian, McMillan slowly closed the distance between them and both aircraft remained in radio contact with each other and Bermuda. Second pilot aboard the Star Tiger was David Colby DFC, like McMillan a highly experienced pilot and ex-RAF Pathfinder Force squadron leader. By 01:26 on 30 January, after 10 hours in the air, Star Tiger was only behind the Lancastrian. The navigator of the Lancastrian managed to fix their position using celestial navigation and found that the winds had blown the aircraft off-track in the previous hour. By this time, Star Tiger had passed its Point of No Alternative, at which it could have diverted to Newfoundland, and was committed to remaining on course for Bermuda. At about 02:00 Cyril Ellison, Star Tiger's navigator,Ottaway and Ottaway, 143, 151 fixed the aircraft's position and learned that they too had been blown off course and were crabbing away from Bermuda. He gave McMillan a new course which turned the aircraft directly into a gale. However, McMillan still expected to reach Bermuda with at least an hour's worth of fuel remaining upon landing. At 03:00 Captain Griffin aboard the Lancastrian amended his ETA from 03:56 to 05:00, and called Star Tiger to say that he was switching to voice telephony to contact Bermuda Approach Control. Griffin later testified that he heard nothing from Star Tiger to indicate that it was in trouble and that from then until he touched down at 04:11 his own aircraft encountered no turbulence, icing, fog or electrical storms.Orange, p. 252 A merchant ship, SS Troubadour, had reported seeing a low flying aircraft with lights blinking about halfway between Bermuda and the entrance to Delaware Bay, which meant that if the aircraft was Star Tiger, then it had gone well off-course from Bermuda. This alleged sighting occurred about 2 o'clock [Eastern Standard Time] in the morning ==Loss== At 03:04 Radio Officer Robert Tuck aboard Star Tiger requested a radio bearing from Bermuda, but the signal was not strong enough to obtain an accurate reading. Tuck repeated the request 11 minutes later, and this time the Bermuda radio operator was able to obtain a bearing of 72 degrees, accurate to within 2 degrees. The Bermuda operator transmitted this information, and Tuck acknowledged receipt at 03:17. This was the last communication with the aircraft.Ottaway and Ottaway, 153 The Bermuda operator tried to contact Star Tiger at 03:50 and receiving no reply, thought that it had gone over to direct radio contact with Bermuda Approach Control. However, Approach Control reported that this was not the case. The Bermuda radio operator tried at 04:05 to contact Star Tiger, again without success, and after trying again at 04:40 he declared a state of emergency. He had heard no distress message, and neither had anyone else, even though many receiving stations were listening on Star Tiger's frequency. On January 30, 1948 a press dispatch reported the planes loss at 440 miles northeast of Bermuda.A Bermuda Dispatch gave the planes loss at 440 miles northeast of Bermuda. Evening Star Washington DC 30 January 1948 Chronicling America Library of Congress accessed 4 December 2018 ===Search attempts=== The U.S. Air Force personnel operating the airfield immediately organised a rescue effort that lasted for five days despite worsening weather. Twenty-six aircraft flew 882 hours in total and surface craft also conducted a search, but no signs of Star Tiger or her 31 passengers and crew were ever found; on 1 February 1948 a B-17 search plane reported sighting several boxes and an oil drum 325 miles northwest of Bermuda; it is unknown if this flotsam was connected to the missing plane or not. Glasgow Herald 2 February 1948 ==Investigation== As soon as it was learned that the Star Tiger had been lost, BSAA's remaining Avro Tudors were grounded by Britain's Minister of Civil Aviation. They were permitted to carry cargo rather than passengers a few weeks later, but had to fly from Santa Maria to Bermuda via Newfoundland, a diversion that reduced the longest overwater leg by .Orange, p. 254 Although Avro's managing director, Sir Roy Dobson, and Don Bennett of BSAA both publicly rejected any implication that the aircraft had been faulty, the minister decided that a judicial investigation (\\"Court of Investigation\\"\\"The Star Tiger Mystery\\" Flight 7 October 1948 p433) into the cause of the incident was necessary, the first such since the loss of the airship R101 in 1930. Bennett objected so strongly to this that BSAA fired him. Lord Macmillan was appointed to head the investigation, assisted by two assessors in the form of a professor of aviation from the University of London and the chief pilot of British European Airways. Professor Arnold Hall of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) was appointed as an assessor. Other persons at the inquiry included Quentin Hogg QC, John Donaldson QC, and Joseph Orrell. The investigation, which was held in public at Church House, Westminster, opened on 12 April 1948 and lasted 11 days. On 21 August it presented its report to Lord Pakenham, who had succeeded Lord Nathan of Churt as Minister of Civil Aviation. The report emphasised that the crew of the Star Tiger were highly experienced, and found \\"want of care and attention to detail\\" in the flight plan, but nothing serious enough to explain the accident. The inquiry reported in conclusion: Among the passengers was Air Marshal Sir Arthur Coningham, a hero of World War II, formerly Air Officer Commander-in-Chief, 2nd Tactical Air Force during the Battle of Normandy. Coningham's death appeared on the front page of The New York Times on 31 January along with the news of the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi and the death of Orville Wright. ==Possible causes== If the Star Tiger's radio had failed shortly after 03:15, her captain and navigator would have been faced with the task of locating a small group of islands, measuring from northeast to southwest covering a total area of , and equipped with powerful lights that were visible from about at the aircraft's assumed altitude. It was at that time about from the islands with enough fuel for 3 hours' flying time. Having received an accurate bearing, McMillan's task of making landfall was not in itself difficult, except that he was acutely aware of the fact that there was no alternative airport: the nearest point on the American mainland was Cape Hatteras, to the west, and well beyond the Star Tiger's range. However, there was no evidence to suggest that radio failure or navigational error were responsible for the disaster.Orange, p. 253 As for engine failure, the aircraft could easily have reached Bermuda on two engines. Its lack of altitude, however, would have made any handling problem more dangerous. The altitude chosen by the Star Tiger and the Lancastrian was much lower than usual, and no previous BSAA flight had flown so low for so long. Wind forecasts were unreliable throughout the journey, especially lower; consequently, a sudden strong gust could have abruptly plunged the aircraft into the sea, or inattention on the part of the crew coupled with a faulty altimeter could have allowed it to dive gently into the sea, giving the radio operator no chance to transmit a distress signal. One notable discrepancy was that although the planned cruising altitude was 2,000 feet, every position report transmitted by Star Tiger gave the height as 20,000 feet. Since 20,000 feet was a more typical cruising altitude for this route, it is possible the crew forgot they were flying at only 2,000 feet and simply flew the aircraft into the sea during the descent phase. The crew may have been fatigued after the long flight, and contemporary altimeters were prone to misreading of the thousand-foot level.Brookes, 40, 44 The aircraft was however also fitted with a radio altimeter. Twice before on similar flights the Star Tiger had been forced to divert to Gander, Newfoundland and just two months previously another Tudor IV had found itself landing with less than of fuel left; less than the amount by which the Star Tiger was overloaded.Orange, p. 250 The fuel cocks for the reserve tanks were in the passenger compartment and, if they were not already on, to switch to reserve one of the crew would have to go aft. There might have been insufficient time given the height at which they were flying.Tom Mangold Inside the Bermuda Triangle: the Mysteries Solved Ladbroke Radio.

Born in Williams, Oklahoma, Martin threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed during his active playing career. ==CareerDefected to Mexican League=== Martin was one of a handful Major League Baseball players who \\"jumped\\" to the then- outlaw Mexican League during the 1946 season. With the reserve clause then binding players permanently to the U.S. teams who held their contracts, the insurgent Mexican League induced players such as Martin, Sal Maglie, Mickey Owen, Lou Klein, Max Lanier, Danny Gardella and others to leave their clubs ‚Äî in Martin's (and Lanier's and Klein's) case, the pennant-contending but notoriously low-paying St. Louis Cardinals ‚Äî for greater riches south of the border. Martin, then almost 31, was in his first MLB campaign after seven years of toiling in the minors and four years of World War II service in the United States Army. He had appeared in six games for the 1946, title-bound Cards, winning two of three decisions and compiling an earned run average of 4.08 in 28 innings pitched. He, along with the other \\"jumpers,\\" was then suspended from organized baseball by Commissioner of Baseball Albert B. Chandler. While the Mexican League raids of MLB stopped, and most of the American players soon attempted to rejoin organized baseball in the U.S., the bans remained in force. In 1949, Martin and Lanier filed a $2.5 million lawsuit against baseball in an attempt to have the five-year bans lifted. The case in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was officially named \\"MARTIN et al. v. NATIONAL LEAGUE BASEBALL CLUB\\" and was argued in front of Chief Judge Learned Hand. As part of the lawsuit, Martin and Lanier had requested a preliminary injunction allowing the \\"jumpers\\" to immediately return to their former major league teams, per the reserve clause. A district judge had denied the injunction on the grounds that it would \\"disturb the status quo\\" by restoring the plaintiffs to positions which they had voluntarily resigned three years before. Also, the judge ruled that the players' rights depended upon disputed questions of fact and law, and that they had an adequate legal remedy in the recovery of damages. Hand and the appeals court affirmed the denial of the injunction but, with respect to the disputed questions of fact and law, added \\"that the cause should be preferred, and that it should be brought to trial as soon as possible.\\" On June 5, 1949, Chandler lifted the ban, and so Martin and Lanier dropped the suit. ===Reinstatement to U.S. pro baseball=== Martin, nearly 34 at that point, returned to the Cardinals upon his reinstatement and posted a 6‚Äì0 mark with a 2.44 ERA in 70 innings for the remainder of 1949. He then spent one final season in the National League with the 1950 Cards, winning four of six decisions and posting a 5.12 ERA. Overall, Martin appeared in 57 career MLB games, won 12 games and lost only three, with an ERA of 3.78 in 162 innings pitched. Martin pitched in the minor leagues through the 1950s; his last pitching appearance came as the 45-year-old playing manager of the Class C St. Cloud Rox. Martin appeared in 618 minor league games between 1935 and 1960, and won 169 of 304 decisions. ===Taught 'split-finger fastball'=== In addition, he would have a long post-playing career as a scout, minor league manager and pitching coach, largely in the Chicago Cubs organization. He was a member of the Cubs' infamous College of Coaches from 1961 to 1965 and served as a minor league instructor for the Cubs (1966‚Äì1975; 1977‚Äì1978) and Detroit Tigers (1976). He became especially famous as a proponent of the split-finger fastball, which he taught to Cub farmhand Bruce Sutter, who mastered it, became a dominant relief pitcher in the 1970s and 1980s, and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006. Sutter's success focused industry-wide attention on Martin's expertise. In 1979, former Cub shortstop Don Kessinger, named the playing manager of the Chicago White Sox, asked him to be the Chisox' pitching coach, but Martin was fatally ill with cancer, began treatments in March, and served only a few weeks in the job. He died June 11, 1979, in Chicago, at the age of 63. ==References * Coach's page from Retrosheet * Bruce Sutter's Hall of Fame induction speech : Category:1915 births Category:1979 deaths Category:American expatriate baseball players in Mexico Category:Austin Senators players Category:Baseball coaches from Oklahoma Category:Baseball players from Oklahoma Category:Chicago Cubs coaches Category:Chicago Cubs scouts Category:Chicago White Sox coaches Category:Columbus Red Birds players Category:Dallas Rangers players Category:Deaths from cancer in Illinois Category:Diablos Rojos del M√©xico players Category:Duluth Dukes players Category:Houston Buffaloes managers Category:Houston Buffaloes players Category:Houston Buffs players Category:Major League Baseball coaches Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Major League Baseball pitching coaches Category:Mexican League baseball pitchers Category:Portsmouth Red Birds players Category:Rochester Red Wings players Category:St. Cloud Rox players Category:St. Louis Cardinals players Category:Sherbrooke Athletics players Category:Shreveport Sports players Category:Siloam Springs Travelers players Category:Temple Eagles players Category:Union City Greyhounds players ","title":"Fred Martin (baseball)"},{"id":"19305802","text":"lion rampant argent in chief three bezants George III Treby (c.1726 ‚Äì 5 November 1761) of Plympton House, Plympton St Maurice, Devon, was a British politician. ==Origins== Plympton House He was the eldest son of George II Treby (c.1684‚Äì1742), of Plympton House, Plympton St Maurice, MP for the family's Rotten Borough of Plympton Erle.

Her work launched a decade long campaign to improve healthcare services and awareness of cystic fibrosis in Ireland. The campaign spanned several years and became a nationwide community effort sustained by Tinsley's articles in The Irish Times about lack of facilities, the deaths of her friends and the stories and energy of people with CF and their families and communities around Ireland. When Orla Tinsley was 10 she returned to school after a prolonged hospitalization into a lesson on Seamus Heaney's poem Mid- Term Break. She has cited this poem as having a profound effect on helping her understand death in a way that could not be communicated otherwise. She began writing poetry. Two years later she won the Holy Family Secondary School Junior Poetry Cup and joined Kildare Youth Theatre. In September 2008 for her work she was named Rehab Young Person of the Yearhttp://www.peopleoftheyear.com/Gallery/Video/2008-Videos/Orla-Tinsley- named-as-Joint-Young-Person-of-the-Ye.asporla In April 2009 she appeared on Late Late Show after writing several pieces in The Irish Times holding government to account on broken promises to build an adult cystic fibrosis unit in Dublin.http://www.rte.ie/tv/latelate/20090403.html In 2009 she began an internship in The Irish Times. That same year the promised government funding for the cystic fibrosis unit was pulled and the campaign reprised. Several campaigners from the previous had died. Ms Tinsley and other new campaigners featured on RTE Liveline Show which played an important role in the campaign. Tinsley was named Irish Tatler Magazine's Woman of the Year http://www.irishtimes.com/news/woman-of-year-cystic-fibrosis-campaigner- honoured-1.771509 in 2009. In 2010 she was awarded the Young Medical Journalist of the Year award. == Producer and Writer == In April 2011 Ms Tinsley presented, co-wrote and researched a special documentary for RT√â's flagship current affairs programme Prime Time to apply pressure for building to begin at St Vincent's Hospital in Dublin. In June 2011 an extract from Ms. Tinsley's book Salty Baby appeared on the Junior Cert exams. In 2015 extracts form Ms. Tinsley's non-fiction book Salty Baby were included in an English Junior Cert curriculum book. In September 2018 Ms. Tinsley co-produced a documentary about her transplant for RTE Television and in the following ten days over 9,000 people registered to be organ donors in Ireland. The organization that promotes organ donation awareness in Ireland said the response said \\"The public's interest in organ donation has dramatically spiked since cf campaigner Orla Tinsley's documentary was aired... such a level of public interest has not been seen for almost a decade\\" The Irish Broadcaster RTE coined the response \\"The Tinsley Effect\\" because of the strong and policy changing work Tinsley consistently creates. == Author == In September 2011 her best-selling memoir Salty Baby : A memoir was published by Hachette. The Sunday Times described the book as \\"gonzo journalism\\" It was shortlisted for Best Newcomer at the B√≥rd G√°is Irish Book Awards.http://www.rte.ie/tv/latelate/20110916.html Siobh√°n Parkinson, the first Laureate na n√ìg in Ireland, was inspired to write her book Miraculous Miranda after hearing Tinsley on the radio. == The Adult Cystic Fibrosis Unit Campaign == The idea of an Adult Cystic Fibrosis practice was conceived at St. Vincent's Hospital in the late 1970s by Professor MX Fitzgerald. CF was one of the first conditions to be treated by a multidisciplinary team comprising doctors, dietitians, physiotherapists, psychologists and nurse specialists but there was no adult treatment centre that had dedicated isolation rooms for people with cf. Huge improvements in life expectancy were achieved in this period but when advances in microbial genetics revealed how highly-resistant and life-threatening bacteria could spread through the CF patient population, it became clear that a dedicated space was vital to treat CF patients in isolation from one another. Ms Tinsley first wrote about the need for a dedicated CF centre in The Irish Times when she was 18 and the words she wrote and subsequent interviews and writing over the next decade drove awareness to a new level. In July 2012, after campaign work over numerous years, a dedicated Cystic Fibrosis Unit opened. The ward block has an outpatient and inpatient facility for people with cystic fibrosis. It also has a floor of isolation rooms for people with cancer and another floor for those with infectious diseases who need isolation. Similar units have opened in Cork University Hospital and University Hospital Limerick.http://www.clare.fm/news/new-adult-cystic-fibrosis-unit-be-opened- regions-main-hospital-today == Transgender rights == In 2012 and 2013 Ms Tinsley focused on the rights of transgender people to attain gender recognition in Ireland. She was named Broadcaster / Journalist of the Year by the Gay and Lesbian Association in 2013. == New Cystic fibrosis Drug == In late 2012 she launched a campaign to get Kalydeco into Ireland after experts rejected making the drug available because it was too expensive. The drug is the first to treat the cause of cystic fibrosis and not just the symptoms.http://www.rte.ie/news/player/2013/0201/3479561-cf-campaigner-orla- tinsley-discusses-the-approval-of-new-cf-drug/ In February 2013 the Minister for Health announced that the drug would be made available.http://health.gov.ie/blog/press-release/new-cystic-fibrosis-drug- ivacaftor-kalydeco-to-be-made-available-for-irish-patients/ Since late 2013 Ms Tinsley is one of the first people in the world to be treated by the second new cystic fibrosis drug lumacaftor/ivacaftor which treats the most common mutation of CF. The drug has proven to improve lung function and health for people with CF. == Columbia University == In 2014 Ms Tinsley announced on the Irish talk-show Saturday Night with Miriam that she had been awarded a scholarship to Columbia University. She now lives in New York City. ==Double lung transplant== Tinsley received a double lung transplant in December 2017.

Merrie Melodies cartoon animated short directed by Friz Freleng and Hawley Pratt. The short was released on December 2, 1961, and stars Tweety and Sylvester. == Plot == The short opens with a shadow of a bear walking up to an outline silhouette of himself and, speaking in a quasi-Hitchcockian accent, announcing, \\"Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, we bring you a story about...murder.\\" The story opens with Sylvester waiting outside Granny's apartment as she puts Tweety to bed and goes to visit a neighbor. He then sneaks into the apartment and stacks a bunch of furniture to reach the bird cage, but the stack collapses and the fall knocks him out long enough for Tweety to escape. When he comes to, he finds one of Tweety's feathers in his mouth and mistakenly believes that he has eaten him. Hearing Granny returning, Sylvester runs out of the apartment and hides in a nearby alley. The Hitchcock-bear (off-screen) taunts Sylvester's success in finally eating Tweety, stating that he had to commit murder to do it, but Sylvester, breaking the fourth wall, laughs off the Hitchcock-bear's suggestion. But the Hitchcock-bear begins to play on Sylvester's nerves, suggesting that there is a good chance that nobody will ever find out about it; then, when Sylvester sees a newspaper headline saying \\"Police Hunt The Cat\\", he hides in a nearby house and attempts to get what he did off his mind, but to no avail. He tries to get some sleep but, after staying awake all night haunted by his guilt, jumps up screaming, runs into the bathroom and both swallows, and showers himself with, multiple sleeping pills, which also fail to help. As Sylvester lies on the bathroom floor sobbing, the Hitchcock-bear suggests that he give himself up and accept the consequences; Sylvester agrees and runs through the alleys yelling \\"I did it! I'm guilty!\\" all the way back to Granny's apartment where he finds Tweety asleep in his cage, safe and sound. Overjoyed, Sylvester grabs the bird, kissing him over and over again, but when he is tempted and again tries to eat the bird, he is attacked by Granny, who chases him out of the apartment while hitting him with a broom. Tweety comments, \\"That puddy tat's gonna have an awful headache in da morning.\\" At the end, the Hitchcock- bear attempts to relate the moral of the story quoting Shakespeare, saying, \\"In the words of the Bard, 'conscience makes cowards of us all.'\\" Sylvester (off-screen) shouts \\"Ahhh, shaddup!\\" and hits him on the head with a brick. The Hitchcock-bear says \\"Good evening,\\" then walks off with a lump on his head, the lump also having grown on his outline. ==Production notes== The Last Hungry Cat is a parody of Alfred Hitchcock Presents and contains a plot similar to both Hitchcock's movie Blackmail and the previous cartoon short Birds Anonymous.

It was later converted back to a merchantman but subsequently recommissioned back into the Royal Navy as an infantry landing and headquarters ship. At the end of the war in 1945 it was returned to civilian service, and scrapped at Thos W Ward Inverkeithing in 1959. ==History== The ship was constructed to carry 80 first class and 250 second class passengers between the United Kingdom and South America, but was requisitioned in 1940 and refitted in South Shields as an Ocean Boarding Vessel.

On 10 May Hilary successfully captured the Italian tanker . The ship was returned to civilian service, and acted as a convoy commodore vessel in the North Atlantic. In October 1942 it was torpedoed amidships but the torpedo failed to explode. The following year it was recommissioned as a combined infantry landing ship and headquarters vessel (a Landing Ship Infantry (Headquarters), HMS Hilary, following work at Birkenhead to equip it with six landing craft and accommodation for 313 crew and 378 soldiers.

The duo are best known for their 26-year run at WBBM-FM, known on-air as B96, for 24 years from 1984 to 2008. They were fired from B96 in 2008 and were hired by WLS-AM as Saturday night talk show hosts in 2010. On March 10, 2011, it was announced that the duo would be returning to the CBS Radio Chicago cluster as the morning show on the new 104.3 K-HITS starting March 14, 2011. It was announced on December 6, 2012 Eddie & JoBo had their last day on 104.3 KHiTs. Subsequently, the two enjoyed a brief stint at WLS-AM as weekend hosts, but have not worked together on-air since 2012. Eddie currently serves as the afternoon drive host on WSSR while JoBo has since retired from radio. ==History== Joe Bohannon first signed on at WBBM-FM, known on-air as B96, in 1984 hosting an evening show as \\"JoBo In Chicago\\". Ed Volkman started at B96 in 1986 hosting the morning show along with Karen Hand and Mike Elston. Elston left B96 in 1988 and Bohannon was moved to mornings along with Volkman and Hand; the creation of \\"Eddie & JoBo\\". The duo enjoyed success in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They invited their listeners, who they dubbed \\"The Worlds Most Dangerous Audience\\", to assist in pranks such as cold water wake- up calls, the daily Twinkie check, and mattress attacks. Eddie & JoBo rode a wave of success, but on May 10, 1994, they were fired in the aftermath of a multimillion-dollar defamation lawsuit filed against them by former WMAQ-TV News anchor Joan Esposito. Esposito sued Eddie & JoBo in 1993 after JoBo falsely aired a statement that she had been impregnated by a member of the Chicago Bulls. Esposito eventually won a public apology and $1 million. It was then that B96 decided to move the morning drive in a new direction, asking the listeners to ‚Äúchoose‚Äù the new morning drive in what was known as ‚ÄúThe B96 Morning Show Open Auditions‚Äù which ran through the summer of 1994. Terry Jacobs and Bill Cody were chosen by the listeners to be the successors of Eddie & JoBo. However, very few people warmed up to ‚ÄúT.J. & Wild Bill‚Äù and the number of listeners dropped when compared to Eddie & JoBo's show. Caving in to pressure from a campaign led by former co-workers and former on-air host Karen Hand, plus many phone calls and letters sent by Eddie & JoBo loyalists, B96 announced on December 12, 1996, that Eddie & JoBo had been re-hired, and would be returning to host the morning drive along with Frankie ‚ÄúHollywood‚Äù Rodriguez starting January 13, 1997, from 5‚Äì8 am. B96 began to see significant improvements in their morning drive ratings as the combo ‚ÄúEddie & JoBo And Frankie‚Äù show and ‚ÄúPrivate Lives‚Äù slowly crept its way up the ratings. Afraid of another possible lawsuit, station management stepped in to exert more control over the show. They made on-air staff changes and imposed a taped delay, at times as long as 20 minutes. Every word spoken by the duo was closely monitored and had to be approved by a member of management prior to airing. In addition, a member of management had to be in the studio with Eddie & JoBo at all times or they could not broadcast. Eddie & JoBo adapted to the changes, and ratings continued to climb back to their former glory. Private Lives was dropped from morning drive in 1999 and Eddie & JoBo hosted from 5‚Äì10am under tight restrictions until May 29, 2002. Rival station WKSC-FM 103.5 made an offer to them to do morning drive unrestricted on their station. B96 pulled the show as a negotiation tactic in the hopes of keeping the show. Negotiations continued until July when B96 announced that Eddie & JoBo signed on with the station in a 7-year, $21 million deal that began immediately. Also, B96 agreed to drop all restrictions on the show. Eddie & JoBo resumed a live show on July 22, 2002. However, the show began to see a marked decline in ratings. Many attributed this to the station's overall severe decline in ratings ever since dropping its heavy dance music format for an all hip-hop & rap format in the late 1990s. Ever since abandoning dance music, B96 witnessed a steady decline from #1 in 1998, all the way down to #9, and even lower in recent years. On November 21, 2008, Eddie, JoBo and Erica were relieved of their morning show duties. Following Eddie and JoBo's yearlong stint at WJMK- FM in Chicago, following the station's revamped \\"K-HITS\\" branding, the two's career remained dormant for several years before a possible resurgence in 2014. In June 2014, it was announced that a deal at WLS-FM for the two DJs was in the works, with the final stages of the contract being laid out and possibilities being up in the air. However, at the last minute, JoBo opted out of the contract, resulting in the station not wanting just Eddie to hold the position and the offer was terminated. The two assured the split was amicable and both remained friends. Both Eddie and JoBo served as the spokesmen for United Auto Insurance, a Chicago-based insurance company and have yet to reunite on the air in any form. As of 2019, Eddie currently hosts the afternoon drive on WSSR, and hosted the morning show on WFXF from 2018 to 2019, while JoBo has since retired from radio and currently resides in Freeport, IL. ==Career at WLS AM== After being fired in November 2008, Facebook groups were made petitioning for Eddie & JoBo to be put back on the air. B96 still aired the United Auto Insurance radio commercials until their contract expired. Months later, they served as fill-in personalities on the WLS-AM weekday talk show The Roe Conn Show. This led to their hiring by WLS as Saturday night hosts. Their show aired every Saturday night from 7-9pm, occasionally 9:30pm-Midnight. The show was dubbed \\"Eddie and Jobo's Saturday Night Talk Party,\\" but was cancelled in 2012. ==CDs== B96 has released CDs from its many DJs and \\"mixmasters\\", the most notable being Too Kool Kris. Eddie, JoBo, and B96 released 2 CDs titled Eddie & JoBo Funny Songs Vol. 1 and Eddie & JoBo Funny Songs Vol. 2. However, these CDs did not contain just songs, regardless of the fact that Eddie & JoBo had made enough songs to do so. Funny Songs Vol. 1 came out in 2001, in the Chicago area stores. It was released by MCA Records and sold at area stores. It was an enhanced computer CD and included parodies of songs by Backstreet Boys, Enrique Iglesias, The Outhere Brothers, Ohio Players, Reality and others. == Funny Songs Vol. 1 Track Listing == # Intro # Sammy Sosa # Psycho Shower # Jazz Boys # Mrs. Pillafuff's Answering Machine Message # Boom Boom Valpo # Mrs. Pillafuff Searches For NSYNC Tickets # Another Bite # Marge McDouche's Answering Machine Message # Tonya # Marge McDouche's Crab Love Test! # Buy More Clothes # Quit Blowing Fumes From Cigars # Backstreet Boys Interview (Part 1) # Backstreet Boys Interview (Part 2) # Backstreet Boys Interview (Part 3) # Backstreet Boys Interview (Part 4) # Eddie & JoBo's Christmas Song Other songs by Eddie & JoBo \\"Ken Doll\\" (parody of \\"Barbie Girl\\" by Aqua), \\"Dumber Girls\\" (parody of \\"Summer Girls\\" by LFO) and \\"Man, I Feel Like a Man!\\" (parody of \\"Man, I feel like a Woman\\" by Shania Twain). == References == Category:Radio in Chicago Category:American talk radio hosts Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Eddie &amp; JoBo"},{"id":"19306623","text":"Jack Endino is an influential audio engineer and musician particularly associated with Seattle label Sub Pop and the grunge movement.

The genus was named in 1937, and the type species, Benthosuchus sushkini, was named in 1940. Benthosuchus has traditionally been considered a member of the temnospondyl superfamily Trematosauroidea, and the family Benthosuchidae was established in 1940 to include Benthosuchus and the related trematosauroid Thoosuchus. Some recent phylogenetic studies have removed Benthosuchus from Trematosauroidea entirely, placing it as a closer relative of Mastodonsauroidea, another group of Triassic temnospondyls. Other studies retain Benthosuchus within Trematosauroidea, but since Benthosuchus and Thoosuchus have successively basal positions on these trees they form a paraphyletic grouping, not a valid clade. In either case, Benthosuchidae is a monotypic family containing only Benthosuchus. ==Description== Benthosuchus skull is about 0.75 m long (it is comparatively short in young individuals but lengthens with age), and the overall body length is about 2.5 m. It existed in widely overflowing rivers of the East Russian Depression. ==Phylogeny== Benthosuchus is traditionally considered a close relative of a group of temnospondyls called capitosaurids. In particular, it bears a close resemblance to the capitosaurid Wetlugasaurus. Many of the early large-scale phylogenetic analyses of temnospondyls place Benthosuchus within a clade called Capitosauria. However, more recent analyses such as that of Fortuny et al. (2011) recover Benthosuchus within another clade called Trematosauria. Occasionally it is grouped near the trematosaurid family Trematosauridae as a basal member of the group Trematosauroidea. Fortuny et al. found that Benthosuchus positioned outside Trematosauroidea as a more basal trematosaurian. Below is a cladogram from Fortuny et al. (2011) showing the phylogenetic placement of Benthosuchus: ==References== Category:Triassic temnospondyls Category:Extinct animals of Russia Category:Capitosaurs Category:Fossil taxa described in 1937 Category:Taxa named by Ivan Yefremov ","title":"Benthosuchus"},{"id":"19306666","text":"This type of political party was constructed in June 2004 and sees itself as a \\"true opposition party.\\" Its leader is a Cambodian-American called Sum Sitha which is its party chairman. ==Political ideology== This political party promotes some political ideologies.

In about 1890 it was bought by the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Co. which operated it to bottle and distribute beer, up to the Prohibition. It was built as a four-story building with sandstone block walls thick. In 1890 the fourth floor and the gable roof were removed and a two-story brick section was added at the front. A one-story extension to the rear was added in 1927.

Founded in 1991, its stated goals are to \\"raise awareness of the critical need for timely immunizations and to foster a systematic way to immunize all of America's children by age two.\\" ECBT was founded by former First Lady of the United States, Rosalynn Carter, and former First Lady of Arkansas, Betty Bumpers. ==Background== In 1991, Rosalynn Carter and Betty Bumpers founded Every Child By Two (ECBT) in response to a measles outbreak in which around 150 people, including young children, died as a result of contracting the disease. At the time, Carter said, \\"It is imperative that we move quickly to increase our capacity to vaccinate children who are at risk for measles and other diseases, such as mumps, rubella and polio.\\" Carter and Bumpers started the national immunization awareness project by enlisting the help of governors' spouses to advocate for vaccinations with the goal of immunizing 95% of U.S. children against diseases like diphtheria, measles, and rubella by the year 2000. The group also expanded their educational outreach to include information about other vaccine preventable diseases, including chickenpox, whooping cough, and HPV. ECBT has partnered with such groups as the American Nurses Association, Parents of Kids with Infectious Diseases (PKIDs), rotary clubs, state health departments, schools and universities. ECBT is also part of the Immunization Advocacy Coalition. ==Immunize On Time, Every Time== ECBT supports the use of immunization registries through which health care providers can track children's immunization histories for the purpose of reducing the number of missed immunizations. ==Criticism== In 2008, ECBT was criticized in a CBS News feature by reporter Sharyl Atkisson in a feature called \\"How Independent Are Vaccine Defenders?\\" that questioned the group's link with pharmaceutical companies and a possible risk for conflict of interest. The report stated that it was not illegal for the group to receive funds from the vaccine industry.

The garden moved to its current site in Stoke Bishop having previously been at two other sites in the city. The 4,500 species of plants are displayed in collections relating to evolution, Mediterranean, local flora and rare natives and finally useful plants. ==History== The pool in front of the Holmes The University of Bristol established a botanic garden in 1882 at Royal Fort House adjacent to Tyndall Avenue. It was laid out by Adolf Leipner. This site was later known as the Hiatt Baker Garden. In 1959 the site of the Botanic Garden was used to build the university's Senate House. The botanic collection was moved to the spacious gardens of Bracken Hill beside North Road, Leigh Woods, near the Clifton Suspension Bridge. The Bracken Hill house and gardens had been established in 1886 by Melville Wills, a noted benefactor to Bristol University. Bracken Hill house and some of the gardens continued to be used by the plant pathology and other services of the government's National Agricultural Advisory Service (NAAS), advising farmers and growers from Herefordshire and Dorset to Lands End during and after World War II when UK- grown crops were vital to minimise rationing. See, for instance, the cereal and vegetable diseases work of Lawrence Ogilvie at Bracken Hill. The NAAS staff, laboratories and offices had moved there from the Long Ashton Research Station also to the west of Bristol. In 2005 the botanic collections were relocated to The Holmes, a site in Stoke Bishop opposite Churchill Hall. The Holmes had been built in 1879 and had a ornamental garden. It had been used by United States Army staff during the preparations for the Normandy landings during World War II. The new garden designed by Land Use Consultants advised by Peter Crane, was the first University Botanic Garden built in the UK in the 21st century. Various organised tours and visits are available along with some horticultural talks and courses. ==Displays== Victoria cruziana in the tropical zone greenhouse The garden has of greenhouses divided into cool, warm-temperate, sub-tropic and tropical zones which house plants from the evolution collection. The tropical zone includes a raised pool with aquatic plants including the water lily Victoria cruziana. The displays include 4500 plant species. These are divided into collections of evolution, Mediterranean, local-flora, rare-native, and finally useful plants. The useful-plant displays include herb gardens with western, Chinese and herbal medicine, including species used in Ayurvedic and Southern African medicine. Displays of plants from the Mediterranean climate region include those from several continents. Plant evolution is illustrated by several displays. The local-flora and rare- native collection includes the unusual species found in the Avon Gorge, Mendip Hills, Somerset Levels and surrounding areas. These plants include the Bristol Onion, Cheddar Pink and various species of Whitebeam. The Botanic Garden, in partnership with the Arnolfini gallery, has created a floating ballast-seed garden on an old barge in Bristol Harbour. ==References *The University of Bristol botanic garden Bristol University Botanic Garden Category:University of Bristol Category:Gardens in Bristol Category:1882 establishments in England ","title":"University of Bristol Botanic Garden"},{"id":"19306820","text":"The Sanctuary of Minerva is a temple of the Roman era, situated at Breno, in locality Spinera. It rises to a rocky outcrop on the banks of the river Oglio, faced with a natural cave within which flowed a spring. The sanctuary and the statue of Minerva. ==History== The site was already a place of worship since the Iron Age and had a shrine (which were found a few yards of stone and a brandopferplatz) that is a paved area that housed the burning rituals. Following the Romanization of the camunian territory, on the former sanctuary was built, in the early first century, a Roman temple dedicated to the goddess Minerva. The Roman final structure, built next to the indigenous, consisted of a row of rooms assigned to the rock and the sides by two wings that porticoed heading for the river delimiting the courtyard of the temple. The main hall housed in an elevated niche, the statue of Minerva, Roman copy of a Greek statue of the fifth century BC In the fourth century started the process of Christianization of Valle Camonica that imposed the end of the cult of Minerva during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. Into the fifth century the sanctuary was destroyed by a violent fire, and the statue of Minerva was beheaded with force. Later, during the thirteenth century, a flood of the Oglio river covered the area in debris and the site was finally abandoned. ==Discovery== The existence of the temple was largely forgotten with time following the Christianization of Valcamonica, although some collective memory of the temple survived among locals, with a nearby bridge being referred to as ponte di Minerva (the bridge of Minerva) and a nearby church, although dedicated to Virgin Mary, being colloquially referred to by locals as \\"The Church of Minerva.\\" However, the temple's existence and the roots of the local nicknames for the nearby bridge and church were officially forgotten. The temple was rediscovered by chance in 1986 during an excavation for the laying of pipes. Starting in 2004, it was the subject of a restoration which, together with the laying of coverage and implementation of information pathways, have turned into a museum that was opened to the public on 29 September 2007. In particular, for illustrative purposes, there was placed a copy of the statue of Minerva Hygeia, whose original is exhibited at the National Museum of Valcamonica of Cividate Camuno. ==Gallery== File:Santuario_di_Minerva_-_statua_nell'aula_centrale_- _Spinera_di_Breno_(Foto_Luca_Giarelli).jpgThe main hall of the temple File:Statua_di_Minerva_-_Museo_Nazionale_di_Valle_Camonica_- _Cividate_Camuno_(Foto_Luca_Giarelli).jpgThe statue of Minerva Hygeia, preserved in the National Museum of Valcamonica of Cividate Camuno File:Sacello laterale della chiesa di S.

After having finished the 2010-11 season with Timr√•, Klingberg joined the Thrashers' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate the Chicago Wolves. He made his AHL debut on 19 March in a 3‚Äì4 loss against the Oklahoma City Barons, and scored his first goal on 27 March in a 2‚Äì3 loss against the Rockford Icehogs.

From 1751 until 1807 he was Reigning prince of the Principality of Anhalt-Dessau and from 1807 the first Duke of the Duchy of Anhalt-Dessau. A strong supporter of the Enlightenment, Leopold undertook numerous reforms in his principality and made Anhalt-Dessau one of the most modern and prosperous of the small German states. An Anglophile, Leopold also extended and altered the old gardens of Oranienbaum that were laid out in Dutch style to create the first and largest of the English parks of his time, renamed the Dessau-W√∂rlitz Garden Realm. ==Early life== Leopold was born at Dessau as the eldest son of the later Leopold II, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, by his wife Gisela Agnes, daughter of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-K√∂then. After having lost both parents in 1751 (his mother on 20 April and his father on 16 December), the eleven-year-old Leopold inherited Anhalt-Dessau under the regency of his uncle, Prince Dietrich. Following in the footsteps of his grandfather and father, Leopold joined the Prussian army. After the Battle of Kol√≠n (18 June 1757), he was impressed so negatively by the spectacle of warfare that he resigned from the army and declared the neutrality of Anhalt- Dessau. ==Rule== Portrait of Leopold III in 1762In 1758 he was declared of age and assumed the government of his lands. An Anglophile and strong supporter of the Enlightenment, Leopold took special interest in the education of the population of his principality in science and nature. His numerous reforms in the areas of education, health care, social services, roads, agriculture, forestry, and industry made Anhalt-Dessau one of the most modern and prosperous of the small German states. The most conspicuous of his improvements included planting fruit trees along dykes and the construction of beautiful buildings.J.

However his reforms included public works programs repairing dykes destroyed by flooding, providing social housing, education, sanitation, the first public parks, burial grounds irrespective of social rank, as well as liberal policies towards the Jewish community, including allowing for the founding of a Jewish school and the first Jewish newspaper in Germany.Morley, \\"The Bauhaus Effect,\\" 11. He engaged Friedrich Wilhelm von Erdmannsdorff to build W√∂rlitz Palace (1769‚Äì1773), the first Neoclassical building in Germany. In 1774 Leopold engaged von Erdmannsdorff to construct a small residence with a small English park as a gift to his wife; in her honor, the castle took the name Schloss Luisium. Leopold also extended and altered the old gardens of Oranienbaum that were laid out in Dutch style to create the first and largest of the English parks of his time, renamed the Dessau-W√∂rlitz Garden Realm. In 1782 Leopold was tried by the F√ºrstenbund for his opposition to Prussian hegemony. In 1806 he was invited to Paris by Napoleon, who was impressed by his reputation. Leopold was one of the last princes to join the Confederation of the Rhine on 18 April 1807. On the other hand, despite his differences with the Prussian crown, he offered the Prussian official Ferdinand von Schill an honorable reception in Dessau in 1809. Leopold was elevated to the rank of duke in 1807. As the head of the senior Anhalt branch, he could not earlier by etiquette receive his kinsmen, the Princes of Anhalt-K√∂then and Anhalt-Bernburg, who were raised to that rank before him. He received the title by paying a considerable sum of money to the Emperor shortly before the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, just as the prince of Anhalt-Bernburg had done before him. In 1812 Leopold became regent of the duchy of Anhalt-K√∂then during the minority of Duke Louis Augustus Karl Frederick Emil. Leopold died after a fall from his horse at Schloss Luisium, near Dessau, in 1817. He was succeeded by his eldest grandson Leopold IV, because his son, the Hereditary Prince Frederick, had predeceased him. ==Marriage and issue== Princess Louise of Brandenburg-Schwedt In Charlottenburg on 25 July 1767 Leopold married his cousin Louise Henriette Wilhelmine (b.

R. Ry. Ananda Ranga Pillai (; 30 March 1709 - 16 January 1761) (often pronounced as ƒÄna√±tara√±kam Pillai) was a dubash in the service of the French East India Company. He is mainly famous for his set of private diaries from the years 1736 to 1761 which portray life in 18th century India. He is also remembered for developing the Tiruvengadam courtage strategy, a new method of courtage in India that is popularly described in several Indian economic books. As described in his journals, it consists in developing a strategy of making new fraud coins in a parallel economy. Ananda Ranga Pillai was born in Madras in a well-to-do family. At a very early age, Ananda Ranga Pillai emigrated with his father to Pondicherry where the family pursued their business interests. On his father's death in 1726, Ananda Ranga was made dubash and served in his capacity until his removal on grounds of ill-health and deteriorating performance. Ananda Ranga died in 1761 at the age of 51. Ananda Ranga was especially known for his proximity to the French Governor Joseph Fran√ßois Dupleix, who favored him in various appointments. Ananda Ranga Pillai's diaries were translated in the early 20th century and bring to light life in the mid-18th century and the Anglo-French Carnatic wars. His mansion in Pondicherry has been recognized as a heritage monument. C. S. Srinivasachari, a prominent Indian historian, described Ananda Ranga Pillai as the \\"Samuel Pepys of French India\\". == Early life == Ananda Ranga Pillai was born to a merchant named Tiruvengada Pillai on 30 March 1709 in the village of Perambur on the outskirts of Madras.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, Introduction, p. vii Madras was, then, the center of Tiruvengada Pillai's business activities. In 1716, at the behest of Nainiya Pillai, brother-in-law of Tiruvengada Pillai, who then functioned as the chief Indian agent of French Pondicherry, Guillaume Andr√© d'H√©bert, the territory's French Governor invited Tiruvengada Pillai and other important Indian merchants of Madras, to his city. Relying on Nainiya Pillai's advice, Tiruvengada moved with his family and businesses to Pondicherry and settled there. Soon afterwards, Nainiya Pillai fell out of favor with the Governor and was imprisoned and later died. In contrast, Tiruvengada rapidly rose in favor with the French rulers and attained a respectable position in the city. On the arrest of Nainiya Pillai, Tiruvengada Pillai had fled to Madras fearing arrest and ill-treatment.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, Introduction, p. viii However, De La Pr√©vosti√®re who succeeded D‚ÄôH√©bert induced Tiruvengada to return. Meanwhile, Nainiya Pillai's son Guruva Pillai escaped to France via Madras. His charges against D‚ÄôH√©bert before the Duke of Orl√©ans were responsible for the removal and replacement of Governor D‚ÄôH√©bert. Guruva Pillai later adopted Christianity and settled down in France, where he was admitted to the Order of Saint Michael as a chevalier. Guruva Pillai died in 1724 followed by Tiruvengada Pillai in June 1726. His name is mentioned in the history of 8th class. == Early career == Kanakaraya Mudali at the church he built Pierre Christoph Le Noir who succeeded De La Pr√©vosti√®re had great regard for Tiruvengada Pillai and his family. Hence on Tiruvengada Pillai's death in 1726, he gave employment to his son Ananda Ranga Pillai in the French East India Company and made him the chief of the Indian employees at the Company's factory at Porto Novo. Soon, Ananda Ranga proved his worth. Large quantities of blue cloth were manufactured at Porto Novo. This was made possible mainly due to the efforts of Ananda Ranga Pillai who also established trading posts at Lalapettai and Arcot for trading Indian merchandise for European manufactures. Ananda's fortune reached greater heights during the tenure of Le Noir's successor Pierre Beno√Æt Dumas who, too, seemed to have had a favorable opinion of him.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, Introduction, p. ix Until his death, Guruva Pillai had functioned as the chief dubash of Pondicherry. A dubash was a merchant in service of the company who roughly performed the task of a translator and intermediary between Indian and European merchants. On Guruva's death, the chief dubashposition passed into the hands of another family as Guruva Pillai's children had been raised as Hindus and the Chief Ecclesiastes of the Colony strongly desired that the holders of the particular office needed to be a Christian. When Dupleix became the Governor, the chief dubash was one Kanakaraya Mudali with whom Ananda Ranga Pillai had a bitter rivalry.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, Introduction, p. x However, Kanakaraya Mudali died in the year 1746 and in 1747, after many consultations and decision-making, Ananda Ranga Pillai was made chief dubash. == Rise to power == { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  \\"On considering this transaction, it appears to me that our lordly Governor was bereft of sense; and it was in this wise\\". -  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  - Ananda Ranga Pillai on Governor Dupleix, regarding Dupleix's decision over a minor local dispute.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 392 } In November 1738, the bitter rivalry that had existed between Ananda Ranga Pillai and the chief dubash Kanakaraya Mudali flared up into a conflagration. Observing that Ananda Ranga Pillai had not remitted the interest for the loan he had borrowed to pay coral merchants, Kanakaraya Mudali reported the same to the Governor.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 66 Initially, the Governor Dumas insisted upon the dubash paying the interest but later, on learning of the heavy losses that had befallen the dubash that year, he concededThe Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 69 and even offered to pay off Ananda Ranga Pillai's debts.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 71 But Ananda Ranga Pillai refused. The matter was raised before the Council where Ananda Ranga had to answer for the charges brought out against him.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 75 Ananda Ranga pleaded with Mr. Golard a member of the Council explaining that he had never paid interest before.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 76 At length, the Council decided in favor of Ananda Ranga Pillai and his debt was waived.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 77 On 22 October 1739, Kanakaraya Mudali's son, Velvendra Mudali died at the age of 21.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 102 Velvendra's mother committed suicide on hearing the news.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 103 On 19 October 1741, Dumas left Pondicherry leaving charge to the Deputy GovernorThe Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 182. who ruled Pondicherry until 14 January 1742 when Joseph Fran√ßois Dupleix arrived from Chandannagar.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 184 During Dupleix's tenure, Ananda Ranga rose to the zenith of power and prominence in French India and exercised firm control over the internal affairs of the territory. Carnatic in Ananda Ranga Pillai's time From 1743 onwards, Ananda Ranga won the confidence of the Governor of Pondicherry and rose up the ranks. when the suburban villages of Pondicherry were leased for five years to Kumara Pillai, Vira Nayakkan, Chandramadi Pillai, and Ella Pillai, Ananda Ranga Pillai was able to offer surety for the renters for a period of five years.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 227 Nevertheless, when Kesava Aiyan died, Ananda Ranga was not able to prevent Kanakaraya Mudali from nominating his brother-in-law Gavinivasa Mudali as dubash in Kesava Aiyan's place.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 251The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 252 Kanakaraya Mudali secured his objective despite the vehement protests of Ananda Ranga Pillai. On 29 June 1744, the marriage of Ananda Ranga Pillai's daughter Papal was conducted in regal splendor.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 256 Ananda Ranga further solidified his position by mediating in disputes such as those between Prakasa Mudali and Tiruvengada Pillai,The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 284 etc. Not to be left behind, on 30 November 1745, Ananda Ranga's great rival Kanakaraya Mudali constructed a church at Ozhukkarai and celebrated its consecration by providing a great feast.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 293 Ananda Ranga Pillai, however, reported heavy criticism from guests for inviting people of non-Christian faiths for the feast celebrating the consecration of a church. On 12 February 1746, Kanakaraya Mudali diedThe Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 311 and on his death, there was an inheritance dispute between his heirs.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 314 A Committee of 20 officials were appointed to arbitrate and Ananda Ranga Pillai led the Committee.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 315 The Committee decided that Chinna Mudali, the brother of the deceased Kanakaraya Mudali was the rightful heir to his estate.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 320 However, Chinna Mudali was not satisfiedThe Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 346The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 363 and the matter dragged on until April 1746, when Ananda Ranga's diplomacy finally sealed the matter.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 380 Apart from pleasing the Governor through his service, Ananda Ranga Pillai also incurred the Governor's wrath on certain occasions. There was at least one occasion during the period when Ananda Ranga was questioned by Dupleix regarding payment of the large sum of money he owed to the Company.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 326 Ananda Ranga Pillai, however, soon cleared off his debts by paying one Suga Singh the money the Company owed him.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1907, Volume II, p. 79 However, still, Dupleix demanded 1,000 pagodas that Ananda Ranga Pillai owed the Company.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1907, Volume II, p. 86 It was evident that much more than the service Ananda Ranga Pillai had rendered to the Company, it was Ananda Ranga Pillai's position as Dupleix's favorite that had helped him scale the ladder. Ananda Ranga Pillai was questioned by the Governor regarding the ill-treatment of a prisoner called Mari Chetti.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 396The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 398 Chinna Mudali was deputed to interrogate two eyewitnesses Tandavarayan and Rangan and they swore that Ananda Ranga's conduct towards Mari Chetty was, in no way, objectionable. Based on this evidence, Ananda Ranga was acquitted.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 399 Throughout Dupleix's tenure, Ananda Ranga Pillai entertained dignitaries as the dubash of Fort St David, Indian merchants, and even Mahe de la Bordannais.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1907, Volume II, p. 115 He also supervised the regular payment of revenue. Official communications to the Governor, too, was handled by him.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1907, Volume II, p. 72The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1907, Volume II, p. 139The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1907, Volume II, p. 140The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1907, Volume II, p. 144 He performed errands for the Governor and adjudicated on criminal cases.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1907, Volume II, p. 182The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1907, Volume II, p. 183The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1907, Volume II, p. 197 In May 1746, he interceded on behalf of one Karaikal Tiruvengadam who had been imprisoned and obtained his release.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1907, Volume II, p. 35 Soon after Kanakaraya Mudali's death in February 1746, his younger brother Chinna Mudali started making efforts to obtain the post of Chief Dubash which his brother had previously held.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 406 However, the property dispute he had with Kanakaraya Mudali's wife and his own lack of competence and skill soon saw him out of the race. On 12 June 1746, de Bausset, a longtime companion of Ananda Ranga Pillai urged him to campaign for Chief Dubash-ship.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1907, Volume II, p. 61The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1907, Volume II, p. 62 However, Ananda Ranga Pillai seems to have been reluctant to accept the post initially when the Governor nominated Ananda Ranga Pillai for the post. 193 194 However, on the insistence of Mrs. Dupleix he accepted.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1907, Volume II, p. 198The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1907, Volume II, p. 199The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1907, Volume II, p. 200 At that time, he came to know that another aspirant Annapurna Aiyan had bribed the Governor and his wife for the post.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1907, Volume II, p. 245 However, this attempt failed as Ananda Ranga Pillai was eventually appointed chief dubash. Mrs. Dupleix allegedly demanded exorbitant bribes in order to support his candidature. == As chief dubash == Joseph Fran√ßois Dupleix, who is alleged to have shown an unusual amount of liking and patronization for Ananda Ranga Pillai The official appointment of Ananda Ranga Pillai was delayed by a couple of years due to the stoppage of trade arising out of the outbreak of hostilities between the French and the British.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1917, Volume V, p. iv The British retaliated the French occupation of Madras by an invasion of Pondicherry in July 1747.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1917, Volume V, p. ix This invasion launched by Admiral Boscawen ultimately failed to capture Pondicherry but hostilities soon came to an end by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chappelle.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1917, Volume V, p. xiv In 1748, Ananda Ranga Pillai was officially designated chief dubash of French India. Soon afterwards, hostilities with the British broke out once again.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1922, Volume VIII, p. v The French waged a proxy war on behalf of Chanda Sahib supporting his claim in the war of succession to the throne of Carnatic. The British felt compelled to intervene and support Muhammad Ali in order to check the rise of French influence in the Deccan. In the early stages of the war, the French gained the upper hand and by May 1751, French power in India was at its zenith. However, the arrival of Robert Clive thwarted the French attempts to win the battle for Chanda Sahib and the French eventually lost.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1922, Volume VIII, p. ixThe Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1922, Volume VIII, p. x During the later stages of the war, Pillai notes, Dupleix's temperament grew highly irritable and officers, including himself, feared to approach him.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1922, Volume VIII, p. xxiii The lavishly constructed palace at Pondicherry, the Gouvernement was completed during this period.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1922, Volume VIII, p. xxiv Pillai also expressed strong disapproval of some of the allegedly corrupt measures of Governor Dupleix's wife Madame Dupleix.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1917, Volume V, p. iii The bitterness led to open hostilities between them. Pillai was given the charge of collecting the revenue of a few villages in Karaikal and he performed his duties satisfactorily despite the prevalence of inconsistencies and unreliability of the records kept by his subordinate agents. Following the unsuccessful bid at territorial expansion, Dupleix's fortunes declined rapidly. He fell out of favour and was replaced as Governor-General with Charles Godeheu in the year 1754. With Dupleix's departure for France, Pillai's influence in the colony began to decline. To make matters worse, he was frequently troubled by poor health. By 1756, his health had deteriorated to such an extent that the Governor-General Georges Duval de Leyrit was obliged to remove him from service. == Death and legacy == Pillai's health worsened with the passage of time. However, he notes in his diary, the corruption and intrigues which allegedly plagued the French colony on Dupleix's departure. Pillai died on 12 January 1761 at the age of 51, just four days before Pondicherry surrendered to the troops of Colonel Coote. Pillai left behind three daughters. He also had two sons Annasamy and Ayyasamy who predeceased him.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, p. 11 Since the discovery and translation of his diaries during the 19th and early 20th centuries, Ananda Ranga Pillai has accumulated a great deal of posthumous fame and recognition for his depiction of 18th century South India, the intrigues and deals in French Pondicherry and his description of the French conquest of Madras and the Carnatic Wars. His set of diaries have emerged as one of our primary sources of reference on the Carnatic Wars. Ananda Ranga Pillai has been referred to by V. V. S. Aiyar in his journal Balabharati and had attracted the curiosity of Subrahmanya Bharati, Aurobindo Ghosh and Mandyam Srinivasa Iyengar. C. S. Srinivasachari, a prominent Indian historian, described Ananda Ranga Pillai as \\"the Samuel Pepys of French India\\". Ananda Ranga Pillai traded in cloth, yarn, indigo and arecanut with Manila, Mocha and Mascareigne. He had his own ship, Anandappuravi, which sailed on long trading voyages on high seas. Ananda Ranga Pillai's house in Pondicherry, which is located in a street named after the dubash, was one of the few buildings to survive the British invasion of the city in 1761. It was recently recognized as a heritage monument by the Government of Puducherry. The mansion is known for its unique blend of Indian and French architecture: the ground floor being built in Indian fashion, while the columns which supported the terrace followed the French architectural style. A diary maintained by Muthu Vijaya Tiruvengadam Pillai, grandson of Ananda Ranga Pillai, related the period from 1794 to 1796 was translated and published on 30 March 2000. == Patronage of arts == Ananda Ranga Pillai patronized the Hindu religion, arts and poetry. And in return, poets praised Pillai in their works. Tamil poet Namasivaya Pulavar, who also wrote a verse in praise of Ananda Ranga's father, Tiruvenkadam Pillai, wrote that Ananda Ranga was as learned as the thousand-headed Adisesha serpent. Madurakkavirayar wrote that when he saw Ananda Ranga Pillai, he beheld the whole town of Pondicherry in him who was generous enough to offer him all the wealth that he wanted. Kasturi Rangaiyan wrote an ode composed in Telugu. Tyagaraja Desikar wrote Ananda Rangan Kovai, a poem of 400 lines in praise of Ananda Ranga Pillai. This work, it is believed, took 16 years to complete and was presented to the dubash in the year 1755. In the poem, Tyagaraja venerated Ananda Ranga as the sovereign whose kingdom extended from Gingee to Vijayapuram and Delhi and praised him for the \\"conquest of Vanga, Kalinga and Telinga\\". Pillai, in turn, gifted Tyagaraja with costly ornaments, money and land. == Discovery and translation of the diaries == On Ananda Ranga Pillai's death, the diaries came into the possession of his nephew Tiruvengadam Pillai who appears to have maintained a series of records of his own until the beginning of 1770.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, Introduction, p. xiii Subsequent generations of the family had discarded it until the manuscript was recovered in a decrepit state by Gallois Montburn, the Mayor of Pondicherry, a scholar of Oriental languages, in 1846, who immediately set upon translating the manuscript to French. However, when the translated manuscript was being edited a number of gaps were discoveredThe Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, Introduction, p. xiv The gaps were supplemented when volumes one and two of Ananda Ranga Pillai's diary were found. These were subsequently translated into French in 1870 and 1889. In 1894, Julien Vinson, Professor of the Special School of Livino-Oriental Languages at Paris who had published the second translation (which was, obviously, incomplete) published a supposed full translation of Ananda Ranga Pillai's diaries titled Les Fran√ßais dans l'Inde, In 1892, the existence of the diary was brought to the notice of Lieutenant General H. Macleod, the British Consular Agent in Pondicherry.The Private Diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai 1904, Volume I, Introduction, p. xv At the direction of Lord Wenlock, the then Governor of Madras, an English translation of the diary from Montbrun's copy was attempted. This was completed in 1896. An Indian edition in 12 volumes was released by Agani Publishers of Puducherry on 05 January 2020. == See also == * Pachaiyappa Mudaliar * Pedro Kanakaraya Mudaliar * French India == Notes  References == * * * Category:1709 births Category:1761 deaths Category:History of Puducherry Category:French India Category:People from Chennai Category:18th century in French India Category:Diaries ","title":"Ananda Ranga Pillai"},{"id":"19307132","text":"Law Hiu Fung (, born 13 November 1983) is a rower from Hong Kong who competed at the 2004 and 2008 Olympic Games in the men's single sculls.

This platoon was made famous for its attack on Mt. Suribachi and for raising the first flag on the summit. ==Before Iwo Jima== Wells was born in 1922 and raised in north Texas. He attended Texas A&M; College from 1940 to 1942. He joined the Marine Corps in March 1942 and was selected for Officer Candidate School (OCS) shortly thereafter. Upon completion of OCS, Wells completed Marine Parachute Training School in August 1943. Lt. Wells was then deployed to Guadalcanal with the 1st Marine Regiment in December 1943. After his return from Guadalcanal, Wells was given command of 3rd Platoon, Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines, 5th Marine Division. He is quoted as saying \\"give me 50 Marines not afraid to die and I can take any position\\". ==Iwo Jima== Lt. Wells landed on the island of Iwo Jima and was quickly given the task of leading an assault at the base of Mt. Suribachi. It was during this attack that Wells was awarded the Navy Cross (the 2nd highest award for valor).

During this attack Wells was wounded and evacuated to a hospital ship. 1st Lt.

Once Wells reached the base of Mt. Suribachi he was helped to the summit by one of the flag raisers, Charles Lindberg. When his commanding officer (Lt. Col. Chandler Johnson) learned of this, he ordered Wells to relinquish command of the platoon and return to the aid station. Command was then passed to Sgt. Ernest \\"Boots\\" Thomas (KIA several days later). Wells remained on the island, although unable to lead his troops, until the island was declared secure. ==After World War II== After World War II, Wells returned to Texas and enrolled at Texas Tech College and obtained a degree in Petroleum Geology in the summer of 1948. In 1959, 1st Lt. Wells was honorarily retired as a Major in the Marine Reserves. He wrote a memoir about his command of and war time experiences with 3rd Platoon, 28th Marines, 5th Marine Division entitled \\"Give Me 50 Marines Not Afraid to Die: Iwo Jima\\".

Distinguishing it from other games in the genre, all players draw the same subject and advancement is effected by voting for the most appropriate drawing in various categories rather than guessing a subject. Because the categories are not directly related to artistic skill, players with advanced drawing ability are not favored. The game was conceptualized by Donald W. Scott and is produced under license by Gamewright. ==Components== Luck of the Draw includes: * 210 Subject cards * 105 Category cards * Hourglass style sand time (approximately 45 seconds) * 8 pads of paper * 8 Pencils * 8 Voting Wheels * 8 colored chips * 1 die showing numbers 1, 2, or 3 * rules of play ==Objective== The objective is to collect the most category cards. ==Gameplay== Gameplay consists of a drawing phase and a voting phase. ===Drawing phase=== One player selects a Subject card from the Subject box. Another player rolls the die and inverts the sand timer. Then all players have 45 seconds to draw the subject that matches the number rolled. As drawings are completed, they are placed face down in the center of the play surface. All remaining players must place their drawings face down on the play surface when the timer expires. ===Voting phase=== One player then mixes the drawings, arranges them face up such that each is visible to all players, and places a randomly selected colored chip on the corner of each. Another player rolls the die to determine how many category cards will be voted on for the round. One players draws the first Category card from the Categories box and reads it aloud. Examples of categories are: * squiggliest * ugliest * most likely to hang on a refrigerator * least realistic Using Voting Wheels, all players secretly vote for the drawing they feel best fits the category by turning the wheel to the color that matches the chip on their chosen drawing. When all players have finished voting, the Voting Wheels are revealed simultaneously. The player whose drawing receives the majority of the votes keeps the Category card. Mechanics are included in the rules of play to account for tie votes. The voting process is repeated the number of times shown on the die. ==Winning== The number of Category cards required to win a game of Luck of the Draw is dependent on the number of players; with fewer players more rounds will be played in a given time period and thus more points are required to win. The game can be played with as few as 4 players and as many as 8 or more. ==Awards== Luck of the Draw has been the recipient of numerous awards since its introduction.

In September 2007 a private investigator was hired to investigate Diaz, exposing her real identity as well as publishing numerous photos demonstrating she was morbidly obese. ==Lawsuit== A class action lawsuit was launched against the website in March, 2008 after it was revealed that the diet's creator was a 300-pound woman named Heidi Diaz who was promoting the diet under the pseudonym Kim 'Kimmer' Drake. During investigations for the suit it was found that the website took in $1,200,000 during the month of June, 2007 alone.

Numerous testimonials on the website were falsified, and several of the website employees have been fired for questioning the safety of the diet. ==Consumer concerns== Members of the website were banned after they disagreed with Diaz online. People who failed to lose weight were quickly blamed for not adhering to the diet strictly enough. Diaz encouraged people to continue following the plan despite showing signs of eating disorders.

In a scene reminiscent of 1943's Wackiki Wabbit, the two hungry men start to hallucinate and see each other as food due to extreme starvation. Daffy Duck turns up as a door-to-door salesman. Upon realizing he is a duck, the two Sams chase Daffy all over the cabin, to try to turn him into a duck dinner. Eventually Daffy is able to explain that he is selling cookbooks, and happens to have a complimentary turkey dinner with all the trimmings in his sample case. He lays out the spread and makes a quick exit as the famished Sams sit down to eat. Before the two Sams can take a bite, a hoard of hungry mice dash from out of the woodwork and strip the turkey clean in a few seconds. At the point of despair, they hear another knock on the door. Daffy is there again, offering some after-dinner mints. The two Sams grab him and pull him inside. Daffy is able to stick his head out the door for a moment and tell the audience, \\"Well, here we go again!\\" He then gets yanked back inside and the door closes to a black-out that ends the cartoon. ==See also== *List of Daffy Duck cartoons *List of Yosemite Sam cartoons *Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography ==References== Category:1947 animated films Category:1947 films Category:Looney Tunes shorts Category:Warner Bros.

Carle‚Äôs goal was to bridge what he referred to as the 'divide between Geeks and Grans', in which technology companies were failing to consistently develop products of practical value to older adults, with older adults simultaneously unaware of technologies that did exist and could be helpful in their daily lives. Carle additionally felt governments were not paying enough attention to issues relevant to aging populations worldwide ‚Äì both in stresses on family caregivers struggling to allow aging parents to live independently for as long as possible, as well as on the critical shortage of long term care workers in both home and facility based environments. Andrew Carle with samples of \\"Nana\\" Technology. A word play on the scientific field of nanotechnology, ‚ÄúNana‚Äù technology is loosely directed to imply technologies for someone‚Äôs grandmother, or ‚ÄúNana‚Äù. Carle was the first person to advance the use of this phrase with a formal definition, and one focused exclusively on microchip technologies, with the end result of naming a new and distinct subset of the technology services industry. Carle‚Äôs term and specific application were first nationally published in a feature article in USA TODAY on August 9, 2006. Since that time Carle‚Äôs term and/or definition has been published, quoted, or featured in or on numerous media worldwide including but not limited to: CNN, CNBC, CBS News, Fox News, PBS, NPR, Forbes, Smart Money, BBC, Agence France-Presse, KYODO News Service, and the Australian Broadcast Corporation, among others. Since defining the sector, Carle has served as a consultant or adviser to a number of companies with an interest in developing technologies for older adults, including APPLE, Nintendo, Vigorous Mind, and GTX Corporation. With GTX, he helped develop the first GPS shoe for individuals with Alzheimer's and related dementia, who may be at risk of wandering and becoming lost. In 2012, the technology was recognized as one of the \\"100 Most Important Inventions of Mankind\\" by the National Museum of Science and Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.http://www.gtxcorp.com/GPS_Shoe_to_be_Featured_in_100_Most_Important_Inventions_of_Mankind_Exhibit ==Categories== In addition to the term and definition, Carle has established eight categories to date for ‚ÄúNana‚Äù technologies, and as they pertain to areas most relevant to individuals over the age of 65: Health and Wellness: Including technologies such as those for managing medications, monitoring vital signs, or treating medical conditions typically affecting older adults. Safety: Including technologies for preventing or reducing falls, monitoring for or requesting emergency assistance, or tracking or preventing wandering among individuals suffering from Alzheimer's related dementia. Cognition: Includes technologies intended to improve overall cognitive functioning as affected by normal aging, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's Disease or related dementia. Communication: Includes technologies that allow older adults to communicate electronically via phone, internet, video, or other forms of communication. Sensory: Includes technologies that assist older adults affected by reduction or loss of vision, hearing, taste, touch, or smell. Mobility: Includes technologies such as those that assist older adults in ambulation, transportation, or driving. Lifestyle: Includes technologies that assist older adults in day-to-day functioning including meal preparation, housekeeping/home maintenance, bathing, dressing, etc. Robotics/Whole Home Systems: Includes technologies that can self perform assistive tasks, and/or which combine two or more of the above categories into a single system. ==Examples of Current \\"Nana\\" Technologies== Carle has released or presented multiple Top \\"Nana\\" Technologies opinion lists, which have been published in numerous national and international media.

A shoe insole that includes GPS location technology. Additionally includes the ability to program a safety \\"geozone\\", outside of which authorized caregivers will receive email or text alerts providing satellite map location of the wearer. ;Philips Medication Dispensing System: A ‚Äúbubble gum‚Äù style table top dispenser that releases pills at pre-programmed times, while providing audio and visual reminders. If pills are not taken within a designated time, the machine automatically telephones up to five family members, friends, or a professional call center to report the missed dosage. ;Jitterbug Cell Phone: Designed with simple to see and use features, including oversized buttons, increased screen size and brightness, and a cushioned ear rest. ;GrandCare Systems: A sensor based system the remotely monitors motion and related activity in the home, providing alerts for activity detected as unusual or dangerous. The system additionally provides tele-health and communication capabilities. ==Future Technologies== Carle has repeatedly referenced ‚ÄúNana‚Äù Technologies being researched or developed for future application. Examples cited by Carle have included a medicine cabinet featuring both face recognition and voice communication capabilities, a ‚Äúsmart shirt‚Äù that can monitor vital signs and administer CPR in the event of an emergency, \\"sensory\\" shoe inserts that can provide older adults with the same balance as a 20-year- old, and a personal assistance robot that can hear, see, and smell. ==Trademark and Copyright== The trade name \\"Nana\\" Technology is trademarked to Carle and used commercially, among other uses, as a licensed designation for \\"best of show\\" winners of an annual, national competition of technologies for older adults.

Accessed 2008-09-13. Founded as a gold mining camp in 1905, it endured longer than similar communities in the area, having been constructed nearest to the source of the gold. It lies in the Kantishna Hills at the junction of Eureka Creek and Moose Creek, 3 mi (5 km) northwest of Wonder Lake, and near the mouth of the Kantishna River. Although the community was once also called \\"Eureka\\", the Board on Geographic Names officially ruled in favor of \\"Kantishna\\" in 1944, the name given to the post office that was built at the site in 1905. Its elevation is 1,696 feet (517 m). ==Transportation and lodging== There are several remote lodges in Kantishna. Guests may stay at the Denali Backcountry Lodge, Kantishna Roadhouse, or Camp Denali/North Face Lodge. The trip from the Denali Park Train Depot to the lodges, via lodge buses, takes more than six hours. Private vehicles are not permitted to enter the interior of Denali National Park. Kantishna Air Taxi service provides chartered flights to Kantishna Airport. ==Geology== Several thousand prospectors came to the Kantishna Hills region after placer gold was discovered in the summer of 1905 along Glacier Creek by Joe Quigley and Jack Horn. Almost simultaneously, Joe Dalton and his partner Stiles found gold along Friday Creek and staked a claim on 12 July. Claims on Eureka Creek soon followed as did mining towns. These included Glacier on Bearpaw River, Diamond on Moose Creek, plus Roosevelt and Square Deal on McKinley River. By 1906 the towns of Roosevelt, Square Deal and Diamond were mainly deserted. In 1916, the population of the region was 35, half of whom were men working claims. The placer gold originates from the Birch Creek schist, which is cut by quartz veins bearing gold, silver, and antimony in the form of stibnite. This schist is the oldest formation in the region and is bordered on the south by the Tonzona Group composed of black slates and argillites, and the Tatina Group composed on black slates, argillites, greywackes, and interbedded limestones and cherts. Mining ceased in 1985, after the district was incorporated into the national park.

They filed hard rock claims along this ridge, starting with the Silver Pick Claim in Nov. 1910, while Fannie filed placer claims on Friday and Eureka Creeks, and maintained their claims on Glacier Creek. Fannie acquired the Little Annie Claim in Jan. 1914. The main tunnel of Little Annie intersected a 3‚Äì4 foot thick quartz vein 90 feet from the entrance, which outcropped in an open-cut in the above hillside. A 42 foot drift followed the vein. By 1921, Joe Quigley was developing the Red Top Lode, using a 40 foot shaft and a 200 foot drift to follow a vein. Eventually, the mine included 500 feet of tunnel. Ernest R. Fransen and Clifton M. Hawkins then purchased 17 Quigley claims, from which Joe and Fannie received $100,000, and 10% of gross. Fransen and Hawkins formed the Red Top Mining Company, with A. Hjalmer Nordale, which operated from 1935 until 1942, when WWII suspended gold mining. Company operations included a 5 mile access road, an assay shop, bunkhouses, and a blacksmith shop. The ridge also became the site of the Quigley homestead and cabin, from about 1913 until 1939. By then, Joe and Fannie had separated, and Fannie moved closer to the Kantishna airstrip along Moose Creek. ==References * Kantishna Gold! * Going for the Gold in Kantishna Category:Mining communities in Alaska Category:Unincorporated communities in Alaska Category:Unincorporated communities in Denali Borough, Alaska ","title":"Kantishna, Alaska"},{"id":"19307356","text":"The launch of Discoverer 30 Discoverer 30, also known as Corona 9022, was an American optical reconnaissance satellite which was launched in 1961.

Similar to EMS-92 on which CSIS drew reference, seismic impacts are classified into 12 degrees of intensity, or liedu (, literally \\"degrees of violence\\") in Roman numerals from I for insensible to XII for landscape reshaping. The scale was initially formalized by the China Earthquake Administration (CEA) in 1980, therefore often referred to by its original title as \\"China Seismic Intensity Scale (1980)\\". It was later revised, and adopted as a national standard, or Guobiao, series GB/T 17742-1999 by then National Quality and Technology Supervision Administration (now General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection, and Quarantine of P.R.C., AQSIQ) in 1999. The standard was set for revision not long before the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. ==Liedu Scale== Unlike the magnitude scales that objectively estimate the released seismic energy, liedu denotes how strongly an earthquake affects a specific place. It is determined by a combination of subjective evaluations (such as human senses and building damages) and objective kinetic measures. Building damages are further refined with a combination of descriptive qualifiers and a numeric evaluation process.

Lambeth Palace, London. Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers (\\"The Sayings of the Philosophers\\") is an incunabulum, or early printed book. The Middle English work is a translation, by Anthony Woodville, of an original book written in Arabic by the medieval Arab scholar al-Mubashshir ibn Fatik', titled MukhtƒÅr al-·∏•ikam wa-ma·∏•ƒÅsin al- kalim (ŸÖÿÆÿ™ÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÉŸÖ ŸàŸÖÿ≠ÿßÿ≥ŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÉŸÑŸÖ)[waqfeya.com/book.php?bid=6216 Al-Mukhtar al- Hakim wa Muhasin al-Kalim] which had been translated into several languages. Woodville based his version on an earlier French translation. His translation would come to be printed by William Caxton in 1477 as either the first, or one of the earliest, books printed in the English language.DNB, p. 383 ==Description== The manuscript of the French translation Dits Moraulx des Philosophes describes itself as a compendium of the words of wisdom, or collected quotations, from biblical, classical, and legendary philosophers, written in prose form. Generally the chapters are introduced by some biographical notes on the philosopher, followed by passages of his attributed quotations, which vary in length from a few words to several pages. Colophon of William Caxton, 1477 ==History of original and earlier translations== The Arabic original is known as MukhtƒÅr al-·∏•ikam wa-ma·∏•ƒÅsin al-kalim ('Compendium of Maxims and Aphorisms'), and was written toward the middle of the eleventh century by a Syrian-born emir of the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt, Al-Mubashshir ibn Fatik. The earliest European translation was the Spanish Los Bocados de Oromade, made in the reign of Alfonso X of Castile (1252‚Äì1284). Wisdom literature became popular throughout medieval Europe and subsequently versions appeared in several languages, including Latin, Occitan, Old Spanish, and Old French. In 1450 Stephen Scrope produced a Middle English translation, titled Dicts and Sayings of the Philosophers.The Mirroure of the Worlde: A Middle English Translation of Le Miroir Du Monde At least three additional Middle English versions are extant; the Helmingham Hall MS (anonymous), William of Worcester's (reliant on Scrope's), and Anthony Woodville, Earl Rivers's translation (printed by William Caxton).Joseph Power‚Äôs Note Attached to Earl Rivers‚Äôs English Translation of The Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers by Yoko Iyeiri & Mitsumi Uchida (2017). ==Caxton's published translation== Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers's English translation of The Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers was printed at least three times by William Caxton and once by Wynkyn de Worde.

In 1473 the knight Lewis de Bretaylle had lent him a French manuscript called Les ditz moraulx des philosophes, by Guillaume de Tignonville. This turn-of-the-fifteenth-century French translation was based on a Latin version. Caxton reviewed Woodville's completed translation and added an epilogue. In this Caxton points to Woodville's omission of Socrates' remarks on women, which subsequently led to the inclusion of an additional chapter, titled \\"Touching Women\\". The first printing of the book is dated as 18 November 1477. In 1476 Caxton had travelled to Westminster from Bruges, where he had been running a successful printing business. He wanted to practise his new printing skills in his native country. He had perhaps learned printing technology in Cologne. The first book Caxton printed with a date was Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers, although it is not usually regarded as the first book he had printed in England. ==Notability== This is the first dated book printed in England.

It falls under Bihpuria constituency of Assam Legislative Assembly and under Narayanpur Police Station. Narayanpur is also the name of the development block. It is located between dholpur and bihpuria. Narayanpur is famous as birthplace of Madhabdev. ==Etymology== Some scholars believe that the name \\"Narayanpur\\" is derived from the Koch garrison set up by Naranarayan during the Ahom-Koch wars of the 16th century. But, this seems to be incorrect as there is mention of Narayanpur several times before this period. These include the Ahom Buranji(translated by G.C.Barua)Barua, Gopal Chandra, Ahom Buranji, 1930, p.62 and the Biography of Madhavdev.[Neog, Maheswar, Shankardeva and his times, 1998, p. 122] This shows that the name was actually derived from a previous dynasty of Narayan i.e. of Chutia kings. ==Geographic location== Narayanpur is a small town, situated at the coordinates 26¬∞59‚Ä≤47‚Ä≥N and 93¬∞53'49\\"E. It is about 54 km to the west of the district headquarters North Lakhimpur. Nearby towns are- Bihpuria to the east, Bandardewa to the north and Gohpur to the west. ==Transport== Narayanpur is connected by National Highway NH-52 to the district headquarters North Lakhimpur (about 54 km) and state capital Guwahati (about 337 km). It is also connected by North East Frontier Railway to North Lakhimpur and Guwahati. The nearest railway station is at Tatibahar (about 3 km). The nearest airport is Lilabari (about 58 km). ==History== Narayanpur was earlier known as Bor-Nararayanpur. It was extended up to the Kolabari region of Sonitpur district. Various history writers had different views regarding the origin of the place as well as the origin of its name. It was once the capital of the Chutiya King Satyanarayan. According to John Peter Wade, \\"Narayanpur is thirty miles in length and fifteen miles in breadth. This district is situated on the bank of Pichala river and Colabari of Zokai chook.\\" Some others have the view that Koch King Naranarayan used this place as a garrison, from where the name became Narayanpur. Many ancient idols of Hindu gods and goddesses were found in the different parts of Narayanpur. It proves the existence of highly civilized society in ancient times in this region. ==Places of interest== It is the birthplace of several Baishnava gurus like Madhabdev, Haridev, Anirudhadev, Badala Padma Atta etc., Belaguri Sattra, Badala Sattra, Phulani Thaan, Bishnubalikuchi, Dahgharia Sattra, Budha Bapuchang, Maghnowa Dol,Dongia noi, Gohaikamal Ali, Radhapukhuri, Burhaburhi Pukhuri, Rangati Pukhuri,Naga Pukhuri,Pichala Nadi,Tulugoni jaan are some of the important historical places situated at Narayanpur. Letekupukhuri/Ujiror Tol Rongajan - the birthplace of famous Vaishnav saint Mahapurush Madhabdev is about 15 km from Narayanpur. Maghnowa Doul- a temple dating back to Ahom kingdom era is about 7 km from Narayanpur in Maghnowa village. Petuwa Gosani Than, is a historical Than or place of worship during Chutia kingdom is at Dholpur, nearly 7 km from Narayanpur. [Phulani Than, a popular Namghar (Vaishnav temple of Krishna worship) is in the Narayanpur center. Popular believe is that people get their wishes fulfilled when pray in this temple. Panbari Bor Namghar is another important ancient Namghar situated in this region. * Badala and Belaguri Satras established by Sankardeva is about 0.5 km and 1.5 km respectively from Narayanpur. There are two big ancient ponds Radhapukhuri and Rangati pukhuri located near Narayanpur. * Madhabdev Thaan (Leteku Pukhuri/Ujiror Tol Rongajan) is located at the near Borbali. It is the birthplace of Madhabdev (1489 AD). There are two big thaans adjacent to each other one Letekupukhuri other at Rongajan. Followers of both these thaans demand it to be the birthplace of Madhabdev. The thaans have a huge collection of holy books, ancient manuscripts and cultural heritages. * Maghnoa Doul is located at the Phulbari village and also known as Phulbari Doul. This is situated at the East side of the Pichola River and at the bank of Maghnoa Beel. Once it was a major place of worshiping Kali (goddess of power) and a pilgrimage place. Several Ahom kings are also known to have visited the place. During the Maan invasion the idol was kept hidden but was never returned to the Doul. It was established at the present location at Bor Kalika Thaan near Dholpur. The Doul has a boundary wall of about 5 feet height. The main Doul is about 75 feet in height. Inside the Doul is the Bulani Ghar where the idol was used to be kept. The inside wall contains various sculptures. But due to the negligence of the government as well as the local people, most of the idols and valuable items had been stolen already. Recently the Archeological Department has done a repairing work to the Doul. ===Khamti Village and Bapuchang=== In 1843, the British controlled the Khamti Revolution in Sadia and settled few Khamti people at Narayanpur. They established this Buddha temple at Barkhamti. The Khamti village will be extensively discussed in the next section of this project. Its worthwhile to mention that this village contains some the Khamtis which are only left to a few thousand in number. The people are Buddhist by religion and have a rich cultural heritage. The religious temple of the Khamtis is called the Bapuchang. It is same as the Buddhist temple or Buddha Bihar found among the Buddhist communities around the world. It is somewhat different from the normal Khamti houses. The raised platform is made of wood and the roof is made of thresh. The outer architecture resembles to the Buddhist temples of Myanmar. Buddha idols are kept inside the Bapuchang and it is regarded as a very holy place. ===Deotola=== The ancient idol of the Maghnoa Doul was hidden in a pond during the Maan invasion. The idol was later recovered from Gavoru Beel of Kherajkhat. As the idol was later established at the Bor-Kalaika Thaan, this place become known as Deotola (Deo- God, Tola- to lift). This place is at 8 km distance from Narayanpur. ===Petua-Gosani Thaan=== It took a long time for the British to take the control of the Lakhimpur region after they invaded Assam. This than was an old place of worshiping Kaali Goddess and was discovered by the British. It is located near Dholpur at Ganakdalani. The goddess of this is called Kesai-khaiti. In earlier times the Daphala people from Arunachal Pradesh used to come here for pilgrimage. Still, Durga puja is celebrated at this than regularly. ===Belaguri Satra=== This Satra was established in 1618 originally in Majuli Island- where the two great guru and disciples Sri Sri Sankardev and Sri Sri Madhabdev met each other for the first time. This Satra was transferred to Narayanpur and settled at Jorabari revenue village in 1947 AD. This Satra is very well known among the people of Assam. The \\"Chaali\\" dance of form is a famous traditional dance of Assam. ===Bodula Satra and Phulani Than=== This satra was established in Narayanpur in 1636 AD by Badala Padma Ataa who was a great follower of Mahapurush Madhabdev. It is said that Padma Ataa got the responsibility of the upper Assam under Madhabdev and established the Satra at the land of Jamadagni. Once upon a time this Satra was the center for the Baishnavism. Badala Padma Ataa was next to Sankardev and Madhabdev who took the great responsibility after the demise of these two holy figures. The Satra has a rich collection of ancient manuscripts. The Phulani thaan was also established by Badala Atta in 1555 saka. This is an important religious place and a large no of followers visit this thaan annually. ===Bishnu Balikunchi Satra=== It is situated at the Dakua village, 8 km from Nagpur. The disciple of Kal Sanghati guru Bhabanipuria Atta, Sri Sri Anirudhadev was born at Dakua village near Narayanpur in 1553 AD. He established this Satra with the help of Bhabapuria Ataa in 1602 AD. Aniruddhadev died in this Satra. He was the holy person who turned the Moran and Motok people into Baishanivism. ===Radha Pukhuri=== Radhapukhuri Tank is situated at the Sawkuchi village near Narayanpur. It was constructed by the Chutia King Lakhminarayan in between 1400 and 1500 AD in the name of his wife ‚ÄòRadha‚Äô. Some scholars also argue that it was constructed by Queen Sarbeswari. But the construction work ended in halfway and hence it was named as Adhapukhuri (adha means half) which eventually changed to Radhapukhuri. Presently this tank is used for fish breeding and cultivation by the Fisheries Department, Government of Assam. ===Bhatoukuchi Thaan=== Bhatoukuci Thaan is located at Kathani village near Dholpur. This was established by Keshabsaran Bhatoukuchia Ataa. According to Kathagurucharit he was born in 1605 and died in 1665. This thaan is still functioning in full fledge. ===Akadohia Pukhuri=== This big pond is situated at the Kachua village near Dholpur. A holy Brahmin guru called Akadoshi used to live near the pond and hence this name became famous. Bhatoukuci Thaan is located at Kathani village near Dholpur. This was established by Keshabsaran Bhatoukuchia Ataa. According to Kathagurucharit he was born in 1605 and died in 1665. This thaan is still functioning in full fledge. ===Gohai-Kamal Ali=== The Koch Kingdom was established at the early part of the 16th century. This kingdom was extended from Kortuaa River to Bornodi. Kochbihar (now in West Bengal) was made the capital of the kingdom and this road was made to fight with the Ahoms. ===Ahotguri Satra=== This satra is situated at Borbali Samua Gaon. It was established by Sri Ram Ata in 1683. Most of the disciples are Brahmin. The ancient manuscript of this Satra got spoiled during the flood in 1987. At present it has a collection of manuscripts by Sankardev Thakur Ataa and Sri Ram Ataa. ===Other attractions=== Narayanpur is the birthplace of twelve holy gurus of Assam and hence regarded as a very holy place. It was the center of [Vaishnavism] during the era of [Madhabdev]. Apart from the religious and geographical attractions mentioned so far, it has an entire gamut of other attractions which have the full potential to become a tourist destination. Some of such attractions are Govind Mandir of Nepali people, Sakrahi Thaan, Dahgharia Satra, Sialmara Satra, Dharamgarh Ashram, Homora Thaan, Deberapar Satra etc. The government of Assam has announced in 2006 the construction of Sri Sri Madhabdev Kalakshetra at Badala Sattra at Narayanpur and the foundation stone has been laid down near Narayanpur. The Chief Minister of Assam, Tarun Gogoi, laid the foundation Stone of the Kalakshetra. This would become an important institution for the Assamese culture and tradition. This will be of same style like the Sankardev Kalakshetra at Guwahati. ==Economy== Greater Narayanpur area has very fertile land suitable for agricultural production- mainly Rice, Maah (Lentil), Potato, Onion, Garlic, Ginger, Tomatoes, Cauliflower, Cabbage, Brinjal and other vegetables. Different fruits like banana, berries, Mangoes, Coconuts, Tamol (Areca nuts) etc. are produced in abundance in the region. Fisheries play a significant role towards the socio-economic upliftment of the common people of Narayanpur development block. Till recent times, Muga (Assam silk) production was quite common rural cottage industry. Narayanpur has a Muga silkworm seed production unit under Central Silk Board, with its headquarters at Guwahati. However, the present condition of this seed farm does not seem to be very good. ==Education== Narayanpur has many reputed schools and educational institutes that have produced many successful personalities in various fields like education, media, medicine, engineering, administrative services, defence services etc. Madhabdev College and Narayanpur Higher Secondary school are situated near Narayanpur which caters for the higher education needs of the local population. Many professionals from Narayanpur are working in different fields all over India and many other countries. Writers and poets from Narayanpur have significant contribution to the Assamese literature. Some notable educational institutions are: Government institutes: * Madhabdev College * Narayanpur Higher Secondary School * Dhalpur Higher Secondary school * Harmoti Pichala High School * Pichalaguri Higher Secondary School (Jarabari) * Tatibahar High School * Namani Subansiri Higher Secondary School * Pichala National Academy Private institutes: * Sankardev Shishu Bidya Niketan * Jigyasha Jatiya Vidyalaya * Ekrit Academy * Gyanjyoti Academy Private Computer-Technology Training institutes: The first private computer training institute of the region was established in 1996. The name of this institute is \\"National Institute of Computer and Vocational Training Centre\\". There are a couple of IT institutes like CEC, EKRIT, APTECH in Narayanpur. ==References== Category:Cities and towns in Lakhimpur district Category:North Lakhimpur ","title":"Narayanpur, Assam"},{"id":"19307577","text":"Betula cordifolia (mountain paper birch, also known as mountain white birch or eastern paper birch) is a birch species native to Eastern Canada and the Northeastern United States.

New Brunswick Species of Concern: A field guide. p.17-19\\\\. Retrieved from Mature bark is white or bronze-white, peeling in thin layers. The inner surface of the bark is copper-coloured and the young bark is shiny brown with pale brown lenticels. The leaves are alternate, ovate, 6-12 cm long, and double-toothed. As the specific epithet suggests, the leaf base is generally cordate (heart- shaped), however this can be misleading as it is occasionally flat or rounded. The leaves are dotted with many resin glands and the buds are ovoid and blunt. The twigs are yellow-brown to dark-brown and are dotted with resin glands and gray lenticels. They lack the hairs found on Betula papyrifera.Ryan, A. G. (1978). Native Tres and Shrubs of Newfoundland and Labrador. St. John's: Parks Division, Government of Newfoundland and Labrador. The flowers are catkins, with pollen catkins 2-4 cm long and seed catkins 1-2 cm long. The seed catkins mature to about 3-5 cm long and bear winged nutlets about 2-3 mm long. ==Distribution== Betula cordifolia is found in Atlantic Canada, Quebec, northwestern Ontario, Northern New York State, and New England. It is generally found in northern habitats or high elevations, particularly on moist ground. ==Distinctions from Betula papyrifera== Betula cordifolia and Betula papyrifera are very similar species, indeed they were once considered the same species. The primary methods of distinguishing the one from the other include: * Betula cordifolia is only found in the Eastern part of North America * Its leaves are dotted with resin glands * The leaf base is cordate (heart-shaped) * Young shoots are not hairy. * It is generally diploid (28 chromosomes) Since many of these characteristics vary from tree to tree, ideally several of these characteristics should be noted before making a positive identification. It has been suggested that Betula cordifolia and Betula papyrifera hybridise, however this is unlikely given the more recent evidence of different chromosome numbers. The most conclusive method of identification is from chromosome analysis. ==References== cordifolia Category:Trees of Canada Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America) Category:Trees of Eastern Canada Category:Trees of the North-Central United States Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States Category:Trees of Ontario Category:Trees of Quebec Category:Plants described in 1861 ","title":"Betula cordifolia"},{"id":"19307601","text":"Malacca Botanical Garden The Malacca Botanical Garden (Malay: Taman Botanikal Melaka) is a botanical garden located in Ayer Keroh, Malacca, Malaysia.

These are phenomenological equations that were introduced by Felix Bloch in 1946.F. Bloch, \\"Nuclear Induction\\", Physical Review 70, 4604‚Äì73 (1946) Sometimes they are called the equations of motion of nuclear magnetization. They are analogous to the Maxwell‚ÄìBloch equations. ==In the laboratory (stationary) frame of reference== Let M(t) = (Mx(t), My(t), Mz(t)) be the nuclear magnetization. Then the Bloch equations read: :\\\\frac {d M_x(t)} {d t} = \\\\gamma ( \\\\mathbf {M} (t) \\\\times \\\\mathbf {B} (t) ) _x - \\\\frac {M_x(t)} {T_2} :\\\\frac {d M_y(t)} {d t} = \\\\gamma ( \\\\mathbf {M} (t) \\\\times \\\\mathbf {B} (t) ) _y - \\\\frac {M_y(t)} {T_2} :\\\\frac {d M_z(t)} {d t} = \\\\gamma ( \\\\mathbf {M} (t) \\\\times \\\\mathbf {B} (t) ) _z - \\\\frac {M_z(t) - M_0} {T_1} where Œ≥ is the gyromagnetic ratio and B(t) = (Bx(t), By(t), B0 \\\\+ ŒîBz(t)) is the magnetic field experienced by the nuclei. The z component of the magnetic field B is sometimes composed of two terms: *one, B0, is constant in time, *the other one, ŒîBz(t), may be time dependent. It is present in magnetic resonance imaging and helps with the spatial decoding of the NMR signal. M(t) √ó B(t) is the cross product of these two vectors. M0 is the steady state nuclear magnetization (that is, for example, when t ‚Üí ‚àû); it is in the z direction. ===Physical background=== With no relaxation (that is both T1 and T2 ‚Üí ‚àû) the above equations simplify to: :\\\\frac {d M_x(t)} {d t} = \\\\gamma ( \\\\mathbf {M} (t) \\\\times \\\\mathbf {B} (t) ) _x :\\\\frac {d M_y(t)} {d t} = \\\\gamma ( \\\\mathbf {M} (t) \\\\times \\\\mathbf {B} (t) ) _y :\\\\frac {d M_z(t)} {d t} = \\\\gamma ( \\\\mathbf {M} (t) \\\\times \\\\mathbf {B} (t) ) _z or, in vector notation: :\\\\frac {d \\\\mathbf {M}(t)} {d t} = \\\\gamma \\\\mathbf {M} (t) \\\\times \\\\mathbf {B} (t) This is the equation for Larmor precession of the nuclear magnetization M in an external magnetic field B. The relaxation terms, :\\\\left ( -\\\\frac {M_x} {T_2}, -\\\\frac {M_y} {T_2}, -\\\\frac {M_z - M_0} {T_1} \\\\right ) represent an established physical process of transverse and longitudinal relaxation of nuclear magnetization M. ===As macroscopic equations=== These equations are not microscopic: they do not describe the equation of motion of individual nuclear magnetic moments. These are governed and described by laws of quantum mechanics. Bloch equations are macroscopic: they describe the equations of motion of macroscopic nuclear magnetization that can be obtained by summing up all nuclear magnetic moment in the sample. ===Alternative forms=== Opening the vector product brackets in the Bloch equations leads to: :\\\\frac {d M_x(t)} {d t} = \\\\gamma \\\\left ( M_y (t) B_z (t) - M_z (t) B_y (t) \\\\right ) - \\\\frac {M_x(t)} {T_2} :\\\\frac {d M_y(t)} {d t} = \\\\gamma \\\\left ( M_z (t) B_x (t) - M_x (t) B_z (t) \\\\right ) - \\\\frac {M_y(t)} {T_2} :\\\\frac {d M_z(t)} {d t} = \\\\gamma \\\\left ( M_x (t) B_y (t) - M_y (t) B_x (t) \\\\right ) - \\\\frac {M_z(t) - M_0} {T_1} The above form is further simplified assuming :M_{xy} = M_x + iM_y \\\\text{ and } B_{xy} = B_x + iB_y\\\\, where i = . After some algebra one obtains: :\\\\frac {d M_{xy}(t)} {d t} = -i \\\\gamma \\\\left ( M_{xy} (t) B_z (t) - M_z (t) B_{xy} (t) \\\\right ) - \\\\frac {M_{xy} (t) } {T_2} . :\\\\frac {d M_z(t)} {d t} = i \\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{2} \\\\left ( M_{xy} (t) \\\\overline{B_{xy} (t)} - \\\\overline {M_{xy}} (t) B_{xy} (t) \\\\right ) \\\\- \\\\frac {M_z (t) - M_0} {T_1} where :\\\\overline {M_{xy}} = M_x - i M_y . is the complex conjugate of Mxy. The real and imaginary parts of Mxy correspond to Mx and My respectively. Mxy is sometimes called transverse nuclear magnetization. ===Matrix form=== The Bloch equations can be recast in matrix-vector notation: : \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{c} M_x\\\\\\\\\\\\ M_y\\\\\\\\\\\\ M_z \\\\end{array} \\\\right) = \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{ccc} -\\\\frac{1}{T_2}& \\\\gamma B_z & -\\\\gamma B_y \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\gamma B_z & -\\\\frac{1}{T_2}& \\\\gamma B_x \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\gamma B_y & -\\\\gamma B_x & -\\\\frac{1}{T_1} \\\\end{array} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{c} M_x\\\\\\\\\\\\ M_y\\\\\\\\\\\\ M_z \\\\end{array} \\\\right) \\\\+ \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{c} 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{M_0}{T_1} \\\\end{array} \\\\right) ==In a rotating frame of reference== In a rotating frame of reference, it is easier to understand the behaviour of the nuclear magnetization M. This is the motivation: ===Solution of Bloch equations with T1, T2 ‚Üí ‚àû=== Assume that: *at t = 0 the transverse nuclear magnetization Mxy(0) experiences a constant magnetic field B(t) = (0, 0, B0); *B0 is positive; *there are no longitudinal and transverse relaxations (that is T1 and T2 ‚Üí ‚àû). Then the Bloch equations are simplified to: :\\\\frac{d M_{xy}(t)} {d t} = -i \\\\gamma M_{xy} (t) B_{0}, :\\\\frac{d M_z(t)} {d t} = 0 . These are two (not coupled) linear differential equations. Their solution is: :M_{xy}(t) = M_{xy} (0) e^{-i \\\\gamma B_{0} t}, :M_z(t) = M_0 = \\\\text{const} \\\\,. Thus the transverse magnetization, Mxy, rotates around the z axis with angular frequency œâ0 = Œ≥B0 in clockwise direction (this is due to the negative sign in the exponent). The longitudinal magnetization, Mz remains constant in time. This is also how the transverse magnetization appears to an observer in the laboratory frame of reference (that is to a stationary observer). Mxy(t) is translated in the following way into observable quantities of Mx(t) and My(t): Since :M_{xy}(t) = M_{xy} (0) e^{-i \\\\gamma B_{z0} t} = M_{xy} (0) \\\\left [ \\\\cos (\\\\omega _0 t) - i \\\\sin (\\\\omega_0 t) \\\\right ] then :M_{x}(t) = \\\\text {Re} \\\\left (M_{xy} (t) \\\\right ) = M_{xy} (0) \\\\cos (\\\\omega _0 t), :M_{y}(t) = \\\\text {Im} \\\\left (M_{xy} (t) \\\\right ) = -M_{xy} (0) \\\\sin (\\\\omega _0 t), where Re(z) and Im(z) are functions that return the real and imaginary part of complex number z. In this calculation it was assumed that Mxy(0) is a real number. ===Transformation to rotating frame of reference=== This is the conclusion of the previous section: in a constant magnetic field B0 along z axis the transverse magnetization Mxy rotates around this axis in clockwise direction with angular frequency œâ0. If the observer were rotating around the same axis in clockwise direction with angular frequency Œ©, Mxy it would appear to her or him rotating with angular frequency œâ0 \\\\- Œ©. Specifically, if the observer were rotating around the same axis in clockwise direction with angular frequency œâ0, the transverse magnetization Mxy would appear to her or him stationary. This can be expressed mathematically in the following way: * Let (x, y, z) the Cartesian coordinate system of the laboratory (or stationary) frame of reference, and * (x‚Ä≤, y‚Ä≤, z‚Ä≤) = (x‚Ä≤, y‚Ä≤, z) be a Cartesian coordinate system that is rotating around the z axis of the laboratory frame of reference with angular frequency Œ©. This is called the rotating frame of reference. Physical variables in this frame of reference will be denoted by a prime. Obviously: :M_z' (t) = M_z(t)\\\\,. What is Mxy‚Ä≤(t)? Expressing the argument at the beginning of this section in a mathematical way: :M_{xy}'(t) = e^{+i \\\\Omega t} M_{xy}(t)\\\\,. ===Equation of motion of transverse magnetization in rotating frame of reference=== What is the equation of motion of Mxy‚Ä≤(t)? :\\\\frac {d M_{xy}'(t)} {d t} = \\\\frac {d \\\\left ( M_{xy}(t) e^{+i \\\\Omega t} \\\\right )} {d t} = e^{+i \\\\Omega t} \\\\frac {d M_{xy}(t) } {d t} + i \\\\Omega e^{+i \\\\Omega t} M_{xy}(t) = e^{+i \\\\Omega t} \\\\frac {d M_{xy}(t) } {d t} + i \\\\Omega M_{xy}'(t) Substitute from the Bloch equation in laboratory frame of reference: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac {d M_{xy}'(t)} {d t} & = e^{+i \\\\Omega t} \\\\left [-i \\\\gamma \\\\left ( M_{xy} (t) B_z (t) - M_z (t) B_{xy} (t) \\\\right ) - \\\\frac {M_{xy}(t)} {T_2} \\\\right ] + i \\\\Omega M_{xy}'(t) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\left [-i \\\\gamma \\\\left ( M_{xy} (t) e^{+i \\\\Omega t} B_z (t) - M_z (t) B_{xy} (t) e^{+i \\\\Omega t}\\\\right ) - \\\\frac {M_{xy}(t) e^{+i \\\\Omega t} } {T_2} \\\\right ] + i \\\\Omega M_{xy}'(t) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = -i \\\\gamma \\\\left ( M_{xy}' (t) B_z (t) - M_z (t) B_{xy}' (t) \\\\right ) + i \\\\Omega M_{xy}'(t) - \\\\frac {M_{xy}'(t)} {T_2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} But by assumption in the previous section: Bz‚Ä≤(t) = Bz(t) = B0 \\\\+ ŒîBz(t) and Mz(t) = Mz‚Ä≤(t). Substituting into the equation above: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac {d M_{xy}'(t)} {d t} & = -i \\\\gamma \\\\left ( M_{xy}' (t) (B_0 + \\\\Delta B_z(t)) - M_z' (t) B_{xy}' (t) \\\\right ) + i \\\\Omega M_{xy}'(t) - \\\\frac {M_{xy}'(t)} {T_2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = -i \\\\gamma B_0 M_{xy}'(t) - i \\\\gamma \\\\Delta B_z(t) M_{xy}'(t) + i \\\\gamma B_{xy}' (t) M_z' (t)+ i \\\\Omega M_{xy}'(t) - \\\\frac {M_{xy}'(t)} {T_2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = i (\\\\Omega - \\\\omega_0) M_{xy}'(t) - i \\\\gamma \\\\Delta B_z(t) M_{xy}'(t) + i \\\\gamma B_{xy}' (t) M_z' (t) - \\\\frac {M_{xy}'(t)} {T_2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} This is the meaning of terms on the right hand side of this equation: * i (Œ© - œâ0) Mxy‚Ä≤(t) is the Larmor term in the frame of reference rotating with angular frequency Œ©. Note that it becomes zero when Œ© = œâ0. * The -i Œ≥ ŒîBz(t) Mxy‚Ä≤(t) term describes the effect of magnetic field inhomogeneity (as expressed by ŒîBz(t)) on the transverse nuclear magnetization; it is used to explain T2*. It is also the term that is behind MRI: it is generated by the gradient coil system. * The i Œ≥ Bxy‚Ä≤(t) Mz(t) describes the effect of RF field (the Bxy‚Ä≤(t) factor) on nuclear magnetization. For an example see below. * - Mxy‚Ä≤(t) / T2 describes the loss of coherency of transverse magnetization. Similarly, the equation of motion of Mz in the rotating frame of reference is: :\\\\frac {d M_z'(t)} {d t} = i \\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{2} \\\\left ( M'_{xy} (t) \\\\overline{B'_{xy} (t)} - \\\\overline {M'_{xy}} (t) B'_{xy} (t) \\\\right ) \\\\- \\\\frac {M_z - M_0} {T_1} ===Time independent form of the equations in the rotating frame of reference=== When the external field has the form: :B_x(t) = B_1 \\\\cos \\\\omega t :B_y(t) = -B_1 \\\\sin \\\\omega t :B_z(t) = B_0 , We define: :\\\\epsilon=\\\\gamma B_1 and :\\\\Delta=\\\\gamma B_0-\\\\omega , and get (in the matrix-vector notation): : \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{c} M'_x\\\\\\\\\\\\ M'_y\\\\\\\\\\\\ M'_z \\\\end{array} \\\\right) = \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{ccc} -\\\\frac{1}{T_2}& \\\\Delta & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\Delta & -\\\\frac{1}{T_2}& \\\\epsilon\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -\\\\epsilon & -\\\\frac{1}{T_1} \\\\end{array} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{c} M'_x\\\\\\\\\\\\ M'_y\\\\\\\\\\\\ M'_z \\\\end{array} \\\\right) \\\\+ \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{c} 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{M_0}{T_1} \\\\end{array} \\\\right) ==Simple solutionsRelaxation of transverse nuclear magnetization Mxy=== Assume that: * The nuclear magnetization is exposed to constant external magnetic field in the z direction Bz‚Ä≤(t) = Bz(t) = B0. Thus œâ0 = Œ≥B0 and ŒîBz(t) = 0. * There is no RF, that is Bxy' = 0. * The rotating frame of reference rotates with an angular frequency Œ© = œâ0. Then in the rotating frame of reference, the equation of motion for the transverse nuclear magnetization, Mxy'(t) simplifies to: :\\\\frac {d M_{xy}'(t)} {d t} = - \\\\frac {M_{xy}'} {T_2} This is a linear ordinary differential equation and its solution is : M_{xy}'(t) = M_{xy}'(0) e^{-t / T_2}. where Mxy'(0) is the transverse nuclear magnetization in the rotating frame at time t = 0. This is the initial condition for the differential equation. Note that when the rotating frame of reference rotates exactly at the Larmor frequency (this is the physical meaning of the above assumption Œ© = œâ0), the vector of transverse nuclear magnetization, Mxy(t) appears to be stationary. ===Relaxation of longitudinal nuclear magnetization Mz=== Assume that: * The nuclear magnetization is exposed to constant external magnetic field in the z direction Bz‚Ä≤(t) = Bz(t) = B0. Thus œâ0 = Œ≥B0 and ŒîBz(t) = 0. * There is no RF, that is Bxy' = 0. * The rotating frame of reference rotates with an angular frequency Œ© = œâ0. Then in the rotating frame of reference, the equation of motion for the longitudinal nuclear magnetization, Mz(t) simplifies to: :\\\\frac {d M_{z}(t)} {d t} = - \\\\frac {M_{z}(t)-M_{z,\\\\mathrm{eq}}} {T_1} This is a linear ordinary differential equation and its solution is :M_z(t) = M_{z,\\\\mathrm{eq}} - [M_{z,\\\\mathrm{eq}} - M_z(0)]e^{-t/T_1} where Mz(0) is the longitudinal nuclear magnetization in the rotating frame at time t = 0. This is the initial condition for the differential equation. ===90 and 180¬∞ RF pulses=== Assume that: * Nuclear magnetization is exposed to constant external magnetic field in z direction Bz‚Ä≤(t) = Bz(t) = B0. Thus œâ0 = Œ≥B0 and ŒîBz(t) = 0. * At t = 0 an RF pulse of constant amplitude and frequency œâ0 is applied. That is B'xy(t) = B'xy is constant.

His work often involves collaboration with other individuals and site specific projects that respond to particular places. ==Life and work== Haeg's architecture projects have included the design for various residential and art projects including the contemporary art gallery peres projects and the Bernardi residence, both in Los Angeles, CA. He studied architecture in Italy at the Istituto Universitario di Architettura di Venezia and Carnegie Mellon University, where he received his B.Arch. He has variously taught in architecture, design, and fine art programs at California Institute of the Arts (CalArts), Art Center College of Design, Parsons School of Design, Princeton University, and the University of Southern California. Haeg was based in a geodesic dome in Los Angeles, California from 2000-2014 before moving to the Salmon Creek Farm, a 35-acre former hippie commune on the coast of Mendocino County, California.https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/t-magazine/design/fritz-haeg- salmon-creek-farm-commune.html ===Gardenlab (2000)=== In 2000 he established Gardenlab, a loose umbrella for his ecology related art and design projects. This initially included community gardens for Art Center College of Design and later California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) where he was an instructor. ===Sundown Salon (2001 - 2006)=== In 2000 Haeg moved into a geodesic dome in the hills of Los Angeles, California, where in 2001 he established Sundown Salon,indexmagazine.com a regular series of events, performances and happenings that attracted a diverse crowd, and galvanized a community of east side Los Angeles artists, designers, musicians, and performers. Those who presented work included artists Anna Sew Hoy, Yoshua Okon, Dean Sameshima, Alice Konitz, Pae White, Eve Fowler, Liz Larner, Christopher Peters, Pipilotti Rist, Katie Grinnan, and Jeff Burton; writers Slava Mogutin, Chris Abani, Trinie Dalton and Eileen Myles; and collectives My Barbarian, Los Super Elegantes, Assume Vivid Astro Focus, Lesbians to the Rescue (LTTR), Robbinschilds, and Janfamily. In 2006 the Sundown Salon events came to an end, to be replaced by Sundown Schoolhouse. First based in the geodesic dome as a seasonal self-organized educational environment spanning disciplines, it is now itinerant with programming connected to Haeg's various initiatives. ===Edible Estates (2005 - 2014)=== In 2005 he began planting a series of gardens called Edible Estates, a revival of the Victory garden movement. Starting in the geographic center of the United States, Salina, Kansas, he selected a local family of willing gardeners to have their lawn removed and replaced with a kitchen garden, of his design. The first garden was commissioned by the Salina Art Center, with later editions in Lakewood, California (2006),Patricia Leigh Brown, Redefining American Beauty, by the Yard, The New York Times, July 13, 2006. Maplewood, New Jersey (2007), London, England, (commissioned by Tate Modern in 2007), Austin, Texas, (commissioned by Arthouse in 2008), Baltimore, Maryland, (commissioned by Contemporary Museum Baltimore in 2008), and a public demonstration garden at Descanso Gardens in La Ca√±ada Flintridge, California. The fifteenth and final Edible Estate was commissioned by the Walker Art Center and created in the front lawn of Woodbury, Minnesota residents Catherine and John Schoenherr. The book, \\"Edible Estates: Attack on the Front Lawn\\", was published by Metropolis Books in spring 2008. It is a call for the replacement of the front lawn with edible landscapes, featuring examples of his previous Edible Estate gardens accompanied by essays from Diana Balmori, Michael Pollan and Rosalind Creasy. ===Sundown Schoolhouse (2006 - 2014)=== Sundown Schoolhouse is a series of classes hosted in Haeg's home in Los Angeles. The program started in 2006, just as his related event series Sundown Salons concluded. The school was \\"founded on the premise that artists, designers, performers and writers should be powerful and active agents in society, engaging in a rich and complex dialog that extends to the outside world. The Schoolhouse seeks to present an alternate model for educational and artistic practice, one in which public interaction, physical connectedness, and responsiveness to place are valued above all else.\\" Fritz Haeg: Attack on the Front Lawn In 2009, a book was published about the activities at then Salon and Schoolhouse.Sundown Salon Unfolding Archive, Evil Twin Publications, 2009. The Sundown Schoolhouse group presented classes such as Dancing 9-5, Library for the Future, and 'Practicing Moving.' Other activities considered part of the program have included casual meals and yoga sessions. The Schoolhouse responds to the general interests within its community, and often relates to Haeg's other exhibits and projects. Under the name of Sundown Schoolhouse, Haeg has worked with institutions such as Whitney Museum of American Art, Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Visiting hosts and lecturers are invited to organize courses, seminars, and events. Participants and collaborators included Emily Roysdon, Andrea Zittel, Damon Rich, founder of the Center for Urban Pedagogy and Eileen Myles. ===Animal Estates (2008)=== Animal Estates proposes the strategic reintroduction of native animals into cities. Each edition of the project is commissioned and presented by a local museum which includes various combinations of related performances, displays, installations, exhibitions, documentary videos, and printed materials such as a local field guide. The project debuted at the 2008 Whitney Biennial featuring a designed beaver pond in the sunken courtyard, an eagle's nest perched above the museum entry.nytimes.com Later 2008 editions are in Cambridge, Massachusetts (Center for Advanced Visual Studies at MIT), San Francisco, California (San Francisco Museum of Modern Art), Portland, Oregon (Douglas F. Cooley Memorial Art Gallery, Reed College), and Utrecht, Netherlands (Casco Office for Art, Design and Theory). Fritz Haeg‚Äôs Animal Estates were inspired by his Edible Estates and an interest in animals that he has had all along. He has created a total of nine of these estates. Haeg looked at every city individually, he spent much time researching and working with local experts to produce homes for these animals that worked well within that specific city, which is similar to the Edible Estates. He hoped that these exhibitions would inspire people to create habitats for animals on their own properties because the viewers would see how simple and easy these structures would be to make. ==References *Archinect - Fritz Haeg : Small Revolutions by Amy Seek, 2007 *Fritz Haeg's official website Category:American contemporary artists Category:American designers Category:American installation artists Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:American architects Category:Artists from Los Angeles Category:Artists from Minnesota Category:20th-century American artists Category:21st-century American artists ","title":"Fritz Haeg"},{"id":"19307687","text":"Bedfordshire shown within England There are approximately 372,905 listed buildings in England and 2.5% of these are Grade I.

Built between 1905 and 1906, they were designed by the modernist architect Antoni Gaud√≠. As with many others of his works, Gaud√≠ filled the gardens with arches and Catholic symbols. By the end of 1971, the gardens were practically abandoned. In 1992, they were restored under the supervision of the Reial C√†tedra Gaud√≠. The current sculptures are the work of Ramon Millet i Dom√®nech. == History and description Design, building process=== A bridge in the garden, which Gaud√≠ designed as thanks to a friend Lillet. In 1905, Gaud√≠ travelled to Lillet to build the chalet of Catllar√†s, a mountain refuge for the engineers of the coal mine that supplied the Asland cement plant in the nearby municipality of Castellar de n'Hug. The cement plant was owned by Eusebi G√ºell, a rich industrialist who was Gaud√≠'s principal patron. While in Lillet, Gaud√≠ stayed in the house of the textile magnate, Joan Artigas i Alart, who had an estate named Font de la Magn√®sia, on the Llobregat river. As thanks for the hospitality of Mr. Artigas, Gaud√≠ designed these gardens for him. Gaud√≠ had done a similar project, although on a smaller scale, at Park G√ºell which he was then building in the Gr√†cia District of Barcelona. He sent some of Park G√ºell's workers to Lillet, and the resulting stylistic and structural similarities between the two locations are obvious. As he did with Parc G√ºell, Gaud√≠ designed the Artigas Gardens fully integrated with the surrounding natural environment. He also built an artificial grotto, a typical Gaud√≠ hallmark, like the one he had designed for the cascade of the Parc de la Ciutadella. ===Features, symbols=== Gaud√≠ designed the garden for the visitor, with a path highlighting several places of interest: *La Glorieta, situated in a higher location, functioning as an overlook *La Cova, original site of the Font de la Magn√®sia, where Gaud√≠ used catenary arches, one of his most common construction elements *La Cascada, a stone fountain in the shape of a typical Gaudi \\"trencad√≠s\\", decorated with plant motifs made of steel reinforced concrete *El Berenador, at the side of the Arch Bridge, which has two human forms, one male and the other female. Also featured on the Glorieta path are the forms of entwined snakes made of conglomerate. An eagle in the garden As with so many others of his works, Gaud√≠ filled the gardens with Christian symbols. For these gardens, he took the symbols from the four gospels. Tetramorph images are found throughout the park: the angel of Saint Matthew at la Cascada; the eagle of Saint John at the Coix arch bridge, which crosses the Llobregat river; the lion of Saint Mark at la P√®rgola; and the bull of Saint Luke at the Bull Fountain. These four images are situated in the form of a cross. ===Restoration=== By the end of 1971, the gardens were practically abandoned when an article about the Gardens was published which brought Gaud√≠'s authorship to light. In 1992, they were restored under the supervision of the Reial C√†tedra Gaud√≠. The current sculptures are the work of Ramon Millet i Dom√®nech. The gardens are now owned by the municipality and are open to the public. ==Gallery== File:Lillet17.jpgHigh view, with a bridge visible Lillet11.jpgTunnel Lillet01.jpgView from below a ridge ==See also== *Catalan Modernisme *Pergola ==References *Gaud√≠ in Bergued√† Category:1906 establishments in Spain Category:Antoni Gaud√≠ buildings Category:Gardens in Catalonia Category:Modernisme architecture in Catalonia ","title":"Artigas Gardens"},{"id":"19307725","text":"The Forsakar Waterfalls The Forsakar Nature Reserve ( ) is situated in the north-eastern part of the Sk√•ne province of Sweden, in the Kristianstad municipality near the village of Degeberga.

The ravine runs from west to east and is likely a product of erosion during some of the ice ages. The Forsaker Creek () runs through the nature reserve and passes the Forsakar Waterfalls (), the upper fall having a free fall of 7.4 metres and the lower fall having a free fall of 10.6 metres.

It is subordinate to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. There are 42 regional branches, one in each county of Romania and one in Bucharest (holding documents pertaining specifically to the city). ==Attributes== By law nr. 16/1996 (modified by law nr.138/2013, in order to update the existing law and comply with EU requirements), the Archives establishes norms for archival activity; implements measures from the law on archives; receives documents for the National Archival Deposit of Romania; inventories, selects and preserves the documents it holds; preserves documents on microfilm and other formats; maintains an archival database; edits the quarterly Revista Arhivelor Revista Arhivelor and other specialty publications; ensures the training of qualified archivists through the Archival Faculty and the National School for Archival Training; attests whether a certain document forms part of the National Archival Deposit of Romania; authorises the temporary removal from Romania of documents in the Deposit for scientific or cultural purposes; maintains relations with corresponding institutions, applies international conventions in the field and participates in international archivists' congresses and conferences; and assures that documents in the Deposit are protected, both in peace and wartime. Arhivele Na≈£ionale ale Rom√¢niei The law defines the National Archival Deposit of Romania as \\"documents official and private, diplomatic and consular, memoirs, manuscripts, proclamations, summons, announcements, plans, sketches, maps, film prints and similar objects, seals, as well as photo, video, audio and computer recordings, with historic value, produced in Romania or by Romanian creators abroad\\". Legisla≈£ie The Archives has been part of the International Council on Archives since 1954; has bilateral agreements with corresponding institutions in France, Germany, Hungary, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China and other countries; and is part of the European Archives Group and the European Board of National Archivists. Colaborare Institu≈£ionalƒÉ The Bucharest headquarters has two study rooms as well as a microfilm room open weekdays to researchers (over 6,500 or about 30 a day in 2007). Church and family records are often solicited, as well as documents on the history of Communism and on land reform, collectivisation and nationalisation. Documents can also be consulted at the Archives' 42 branches. Sala de studiu There is also a library at the headquarters, containing some 70,000 books and 50,000 periodicals, many of them rare and valuable; again, every branch has its own library. Biblioteca ==History== At least as early as the 18th century, archives were kept in the Danubian Principalities by the princely chancellery, by church authorities and privately by dignitaries of various ranks in the boyar hierarchy. The oldest places for preserving documents were monasteries, which, being secure, also kept secular documents. For instance, in 1775 the Metropolis of Bucharest is known to have kept a general archive that included private documents such as property delimitations. Istoricul ANR The Archives of Wallachia were established on 1 May 1831, and those of Moldavia on 1 January 1832, as the countries' first modern administrative laws, Regulamentul Organic, took effect. At first, these archives were of a rather theoretical nature, as the legislation referred only to their budget and number of personnel, and not to archival activity. This vagueness had an adverse impact, despite the fact that important cultural figures served as directors, including Gheorghe Asachi, Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu and Grigore Alexandrescu. In 1840, an attempt was made to regulate the sorting and evaluation of archival documents, but it was only in 1862, with the Union of the Principalities, that the Archives were placed under a General Directorate at Bucharest, with the Ia≈üi archives made subordinate. At that time, a distinction was made between documents with a historical value and a practical one, and the institution was made subordinate to the Ministry of Justice, Religious Affairs and Public Education. This is usually considered the point at which the modern Archives were established; in 1864, following the secularization of monastery estates in Romania, its collections were enriched as the state took over a significant number of documents. Further regulations were enacted in 1869 and 1872; Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu served as director from 1876 to 1900, followed by Dimitrie Onciul (1900‚Äì23). In Transylvania, the Hungarian authorities kept their own archives until the Kingdom of Hungary was partitioned following the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526. After Transylvania entered the Habsburg Empire in 1688, methods of document preservation gradually improved, notably through the introduction of registers at the chief administrative institutions. When the Hungarian State Archives were established in 1875, most of the old Transylvanian archives were moved to Budapest. Thus, at the end of the 19th century, documents pertaining to Transylvania, as well as the Banat and Bukovina, were centralised at the state archives in Budapest (Orsz√°gos L√©v√©lt√°r) and Vienna (Haus-, Hof- und Staatsarchiv). After Romania expanded in 1918 at the end of World War I, State Archives were established in three newly acquired historical regions: at Cluj in 1920 for Transylvania, at CernƒÉu≈£i in 1924 for Bukovina and at Chi≈üinƒÉu in 1925 for Bessarabia. In 1925, a new law governing the State Archives went into effect and, among other provisions, called for regional directorates to be set up. The institution was subordinate to the Ministry of Public Education. Constantin Moisil was the director from 1923 to 1938, followed by Aurelian Sacerdo»õeanu (1938‚Äì1953). In 1951, during the early Communist period, the State Archives Directorate passed under the control of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Soviet organisational model was adopted. A new archival law was adopted in 1996, following the regime's collapse. During the 2000s, the Archives has pursued a policy of infrastructure modernisation, including computerisation. == See also == * List of national archives ==Notes * Official site Romania Category:Archives in Romania Category:Ministry of Administration and Interior (Romania) Category:Historic monuments in Bucharest ","title":"National Archives of Romania"},{"id":"19307755","text":"A fashion plate from the November 1811 issue Ackermann's Repository of Arts was an illustrated British periodical published from 1809 to 1829 by Rudolph Ackermann.Ackermann's Regency Furniture & Interiors, Rudolph Ackermann, Introduction by Pauline Agius, Crowood Press, 1984 Although commonly called Ackermann's Repository, or, simply Ackermann's, the formal title of the journal was Repository of arts, literature, commerce, manufactures, fashions, and politics, and it did indeed cover all of these fields.Rudolph Ackermann, His Life: The Populariser of Aquatint Engraving, Pioneer of Art-book Illustration By Arthur Ackermann, pub.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Frank Tashlin. The cartoon was released on December 1, 1945, and stars Daffy Duck. This was the final Daffy Duck cartoon, and the second to last overall, directed by Tashlin. The director is not credited as he had already left the studio. Voices of the male characters are performed by Mel Blanc. ==Summary== The father of a suburban family gets a black duckling for his daughter, Agnes, who dotes on the duck. The duck quickly grows up to become Daffy, whose loud and obnoxious behavior drives the man to distraction, but Agnes defends her pet at every turn. The father then buys Agnes a yellow duckling, who immediately becomes the sole focus of her affection. The father comes at Daffy with murder in his eyes and chases him around the house. Kicked out, Daffy vows to get rid of his competitor. At first, he tries to kill the duckling, but he has a pang of conscience and decides to let it grow to adult size before killing it. To speed the process along, he pours vitamins down the duckling's throat. The duckling instantly becomes a grown, white, female duck, leaving Daffy nonplussed. The father walks down the stairs, laughing to himself, thinking he has chased Daffy out of the house. He's stunned, however, to see Daffy and the other duck, their ducklings bouncing around the dinner table. Daffy launches into one of his raucous stories as the short irises out. ==Availability== Nasty Quacks is available on the two-disc DVD The Essential Daffy Duck. ==See also== * List of Daffy Duck cartoons * Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1940‚Äì1949) ==References== Category:Short films directed by Frank Tashlin Category:Merrie Melodies shorts Category:American films Category:1945 animated films Category:1940s American animated films Category:Warner Bros. animated short films, 1940s ","title":"Nasty Quacks"},{"id":"19307763","text":"lion rampant argent in chief three bezants Lieutenant-Colonel George Hele Treby (c.1727 ‚Äì 12 May 1763) was a British soldier and politician from Devonshire. ==Origins== He was the younger son of the politician George II Treby (c.1684‚Äì10 Mar 1741), of Plympton House, Plympton St Maurice, Devon, MP for the family's Rotten Borough of Plympton Erle, and was the younger brother of George III Treby (c.1726-1761), MP for Plympton Erle. ==Career== He was commissioned into the British Army and was promoted to Captain and later Lieutenant-Colonel in the 1st Foot Guards in 1758.

The Kodak Digital Camera System is a series of digital single-lens reflex cameras and digital camera backs that were released by Kodak in the 1990s and 2000s, and discontinued in 2005. They are all based on existing 35mm film SLRs from Nikon, Canon and Sigma. The range includes the original Kodak DCS, the first commercially available digital SLR. ==History== Kodak DCS 100, based on a Nikon F3 body with Digital Storage Unit, released in May, 1991. In 1975 Kodak engineer Steven Sasson invented the first digital still camera, which uses a Fairchild 100 x 100 pixel CCD.How Kodak invented the digital camera in 1975 By 1986 Kodak had developed a sensor with 1.4 million pixels. A number of other inventions were made to increase usability, including improvements in sensor technology, the first raw image format DCR, and usable host software. The original Kodak DCS was launched in 1991, and is based on a stock Nikon F3 SLR with digital components. It uses a 1.3-megapixel Kodak KAF-1300 sensor, and a separate shoulder-mounted processing and storage unit. The DCS 200 series of 1992 condenses the storage unit into a module which mounted onto the base and back of a stock Nikon F-801s SLR. The module contains a built-in 80 megabyte hard drive and is powered with AA batteries. It was followed by the upgraded DCS 400 series of 1994, which replaces the hard drive with a PCMCIA card slot. The DCS 400 series includes the 1.5-megapixel DCS 420, and the 6-megapixel Kodak DCS 460, which retailed for $28,000 on launch. In common with Kodak's later 6-megapixel models, the DCS 460 used the award-winning APS-H Kodak M6 sensor.Business Wire, October 1995, Kodak Imaging Sensor wins award from Technical Image Press Association A modified version of the DCS 420 was also sold by the Associated Press as the Associated Press NC2000.Eamon Hickey, January 2005, \\"A look back at the NC2000\\" In parallel with the DCS 400 series Kodak also sold the analogous Kodak EOS DCS range, which was based on the Canon EOS-1N SLR. With the exception of the original DCS 100, these early models do not include LCD preview screens. Kodak's subsequent models integrate the digital module with the camera body more thoroughly, and include LCD preview screens and removable batteries. The DCS 500 series of 1998 is also based on the Canon EOS-1N, and comprises the 2-megapixel DCS 520 and the 6-megapixel DCS 560, which initially had a suggested retail price of $28,500.Business Wire, September 1998, Kodak Professional Extends Portfolio of Digital Cameras These models were also sold by Canon, as the Canon D2000 and D6000 respectively, and were the first digital SLRs sold under the Canon name. Kodak used the same electronics package for the DCS 600 series, which is based on the Nikon F5. The DCS 600 range includes the Kodak DCS 620x, a high- sensitivity model with an upgraded indium tin oxide sensor and a cyan-magenta- yellow Bayer filter, which has a then-unique top ISO setting of ISO 6400. Kodak concluded the initial DCS range with the DCS 700 series, which comprises the 2-megapixel DCS 720x, the 6-megapixel DCS 760, and the 6-megapixel DCS 760m, which has a monochrome sensor. By the time of launch, Kodak faced competition from the popular Nikon D1 and Nikon D1x, which were physically smaller and cheaper. The DCS 760's initial list price was $8,000. Kodak final generation of DCS cameras was launched with the Kodak DCS Pro 14n, a 14-megapixel full-frame digital SLR, in 2002, and continued with the upgraded DCS PRO SLR/n in 2004. These two cameras are based on a Nikon F80 body, and are considerably more compact than previous Kodaks. They use sensors designed by Belgian imaging company FillFactory. The DCS PRO SLR/n was also accompanied by the Canon-compatible DCS PRO SLR/c, which is based on a Sigma SA9 SLR. Kodak discontinued the SLR/n and SLR/c in May 2005,Kodak.com, May 2005, NOTICE OF DISCONTINUANCE to concentrate on compact digital cameras and high-end medium format digital backs for Leaf, among others. Kodak continued to design and manufacture digital imaging sensors, including the full-frame 18-megapixel KAF-18500, which is used in the Leica M9 digital rangefinder, until its digital sensor division was sold to Platinum Equity in 2012. This digital sensor company now operates under the name Trusense. ==Models35mm Nikon based=== A Kodak DCS 760, a six megapixel digital SLR based on a Nikon F5 All models based on Nikon body and use Nikon's F mount. *Kodak DCS - May 1991, later called DCS 100, first commercially available DSLR camera, Nikon F3 based body.

Stahlberg mainly molded cars from the 1960s to about 1992, though its modern counterpart, Emek continues to make truck models (Klockau 2012). Other Finnish companies producing similar sized plastic models were Aren, Emek Muovi, Ju Ju, Hot Toys, KMS Myynti, Muovo, Nyrhinen Ky, and Plasto. ==Volvos and Saabs== Stahlberg vehicles were pre-assembled promotional models. Available mainly through car dealerships in Europe and the U.S., models were produced from about 1965 to about 1990. Usually Stahlbergs were packaged in a clear plastic bag (poly-bagged), though later models did come in blue and white boxes. One writer reminisces that when at the Volvo dealer with his father as a child, he remembers the models often would be \\"hanging on the pegboard behind the service desk\\" (Klockau 2012). Some standard Swedish models produced by Stahlberg were the Volvo 120‚Äì122 series (Amazon), 142 series, 164 series, 200 series, 700 series, and 66 / 300 series (DAFs). Saabs produced were Saab 99, 900 series, and 9000 series. Models were produced in 2-door, 4-door, and station wagon versions. Some models from earlier years are now getting rather hard to find, like the 244 sedan from the late 1960s which featured a bit better detail than later models and 'knobbier' tread tires. These early Volvos like the 164 had lovely two piece wheels with unpainted rims and the silver hubs. Later wheels were accurate single cast copies of the actual designs. ==Details and model variety== Older Stahlbergs from the 1970s were cast in a solid color plastic while later ones had a metallic effect along with swirls and streaks in the plastic. The most common scale of models was 1:22 (about 9 inches long), however 1:32 (about 5 inches long), 1:25, 1:18, and a larger 1:12 scale (about 18 inches long) were also produced. Though Volvo and Saab were the most common Stahlberg clients, a perusal of eBay and other websites shows a few other vehicles were also contracted and appear to have been promotional in nature (Fintoys, no date). One example was the 1979 Mercedes-Benz 300 Touring (station wagon). Others were a rather rare Volkswagen Golf sedan, Saab 600, Lancia Delta in rally and non-rally form, and a 1978 DAF Volvo 66 (the Dutch truck and car maker purchased by Volvo). Reportedly, there was also a Saab Sonett, a few other Golfs, and some Toyotas, like the Corolla DX. The Saab 99 and 900 were also produced in police (\\"polis\\") versions and some of the Volvo wagons were made in ambulance/medical assistance versions with red crosses on their sides and hoods. Stahlberg made some of its Volvo and Saab models in slightly brighter toy-like colors for the British distributor, O. G. Plasto. These were packaged in colorful boxes (Minivolvo 2013). ==European promotionals== While other European car makers preferred the manufacturing of promotional models made out of diecast zamac in 1:43 OR 1:35 scale, it seems Finnish companies were unique in Europe by producing ‚Äì often promotional models ‚Äì in larger scales and in plastic (Model Cars 1979, pp. 42‚Äì43). Both of these traits were similar to American promotional model companies like AMT, PMC, MPC, or Jo-Han. Stahlberg was the most well known of these Scandinavian large scale promotional model producers for cars through the 1980s, whereas Finnish Emek Muovi was known for trucks. Nyrhinen Ky was another similar Finnish producer that made VWs and Toyotas, though it is uncertain if these were made specifically as promotionals, and uncertain if they were Stahlberg tooling. Stahlbergs were produced in a softer, somewhat more flexible, polyurethane plastic than the harder polystyrene of traditional American promotional models (Klockau 2012). Thus, Stahlbergs are prone to fewer cracks and breaks, yet are easier to scratch ‚Äì similar to other toy vehicles made in softer plastics. Models are molded in various colors and unpainted. Streaks of darker or lighter color are commonly found through the plastic. Models include precise replication of proportions and detail of actual vehicles, including accurate moldings, logos, and name scripts. Tires are not rubber, but are made of the same type of plastic as body and chassis, though black with accurately cast wheels. Models often have mud flaps behind rear wheels that swing (and are often are lost from play). Rather odd, and rarely seen on other miniatures of any type, are headlights often molded in white plastic as opposed to clear lenses. This may be the single most recognizable trait of the brand. Interior and chassis detail is often simpler than seen in US promotionals. Chassis usually have no detail, are plain, and simply say \\"Made in Finland\\", but some carry promotional advertising statements relating to the real car, like \\"Exceptional roadholding\\", \\"High standard of safety\\", or \\"Swedish quality\\". ==Stahlberg today== Models can frequently be found on eBay and are popular sellers, commanding anywhere from US$30 to US$100. Around 1977, in honor of Volvo's 50th Anniversary, Stahlberg produced a 1927 Volvo OV4 Jakob plastic model for dealers, produced in 1:20 scale. Volvo FH16 Globetrotter Timber Truck by Emek- Muovi. Around this time Stahlberg was apparently taken over by Emek Muovi, another Finnish plastic model maker, known for its trucks in 1:20 scale. Emek had either previously also made Volvo models similar to Stahlberg or, more likely, took over Stahlberg's dies and continued production. Post 1990, however, Emek was more known for its plastic trucks in 1:25 scale (Bickford 2013). Some Stahlbergs, like the Mercedes wagon, were produced in the 1990s in Estonia, either by company contract or from original dies used by a separate company. These models were made of the similar soft plastic, and had similar undetailed chassis simply molded \\"Made in Estonia\\". ==References== * The Bickford Diecast Research Center. 2013.

The team failed to improve on their previous output of 10‚Äì6, going only 6‚Äì9‚Äì1 and failing to reach the playoffs for the first time in three seasons. This was the season where the team was sponsored by the ‚ÄúStarters‚Äù brand. Lowlights of the 1997 campaign include a disheartening one- point loss at Dallas in Week 3, where starter Ty Detmer led the Birds on a potential game-winning drive late in regulation, only to see holder Tommy Hutton botch the hold on what would have been the deciding field goal from ex- Cowboys kicker Chris Boniol. In Week 7, the Eagles lost their first-ever game against the three-season-old Jacksonville Jaguars, and on November 10, in a Monday Night Football 24‚Äì12 home loss against San Francisco, a fan was spotted firing a flare gun in the upper deck. Six days later, at Memorial Stadium, the Eagles and Ravens engaged in a 10‚Äì10 tie. This was Eagles' first tie since 1986 against the Cardinals. One bright spot during the year came on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, when rookie Bobby Hoying stepped in under center and threw for a career-high 313 yards and four touchdowns in a 44‚Äì42 win against the Cincinnati Bengals. The 1997 campaign was notable in that it ended a 13-year radio partnership between broadcasters Merrill Reese and former Eagle Stan Walters on 94 WIP.

Johnson (January 10, 1923 - July 23, 2008) was a glider pilot, aeronautical engineer and prolific writer of articles for gliding magazines. He was an 11-time U.S. National Champion glider pilot, 9-time US Soaring Team pilot at the Soaring World Championships, held two World Gliding Records and is a member of the US Soaring Hall of Fame. He flew for 70 years and logged over 14,000 flying hours, including over 10,000 hours of non-powered flight time in sailplanes. He authored over 100 articles on soaring and flight tests of gliders. == Early years == Dick Johnson was born on January 10, 1923 in Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada. He grew up in Los Altos, California, where he learned the basics of flight and aerodynamics as a model airplane and glider enthusiast. He won the California State Hand-Launched Model Glider Championship in 1937. In 1938, wanting to graduate to full-size aircraft, Johnson read Wolf Hirth's book The Art of Soaring Flight three times. Using a second-hand Northrup primary glider he purchased and being carefully towed by brother Dave driving a 1931 Model A Ford, he taught himself how to fly. Over a period of several months ground skims were gradually replaced by straight- ahead landings, S-turns, 180 degree turns, and finally 360 degree turn flights. The following year Johnson and Dave purchased a Bowlus Baby Albatross intermediate glider kit, and assembled it in their spare time over fall, winter and spring of 1940. With his brother's assistance, they built a wooden trailer for the Baby Albatross glider, and towed the glider 3,000 miles to Elmira, New York, to enter the 1940 U.S. National Gliding Championships at age 17. As a self-taught pilot Johnson had not been licensed prior to this time, so before entering the contest he received a Private Glider Pilot license at Elmira and obtained a legal registration for his home-built Albatross. During the contest he earned his Silver C badge (badge #28), and placed 3rd overall in the contest.Wings Like Eagles, by Paul Schweizer. == World War II Years == By 1941 Johnson owned a Schweizer SGS 2-8 2-seat metal intermediate training glider, had received his Commercial Glider Pilot license and gave flight instruction during weekends on Rosamond Dry Lake in the Mojave Desert of California. At the start of World War II, the U.S. Government took possession of his glider through the War Powers Act of 1941, and Johnson became a Civilian Glider Flight Instructor, training military glider pilots at 29 Palms Air Academy, California. Training was performed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for 14 months, with Johnson flying two 6-hour shifts per day - one shift as a glider instructor and one shift as a tow plane pilot. After 14 months of training no additional glider pilots were needed and Johnson obtained a co- pilot position with Pan American World Airways, Pacific Division in Consolidated PBY-3, Martin 120 and Boeing 314 flying boats. He was later assigned to the Military Air Transport Service (MATS) flying PBM-3 and PB-2Y3s. Johnson remained active as the area wing commander of the World War II Glider Pilots Association into his 80s. == The RJ-5 == The RJ-5 sailplane was one of the first to utilize a laminar flow airfoil, and the first to achieve a glide ratio of 40-to-1.Soaring & Motorgliding, Vol. 61 No.7, July 1997, p.102 In 1948 Johnson contracted with Harland Ross to design and build the glider (originally designated R-5). One key design decision was to use a NACA 63(2)-615 laminar flow airfoil selected by Dick Lyon. The NACA laminar airfoils were developed in secret during World War II, and subsequently released for public use after the war, but its use here was unproven because no sailplane had used such an airfoil before. However, other obligations prevented Ross from completing the project within the contracted one year schedule, so Johnson took delivery of the partially completed sailplane in 1949. He completed the construction in 1950, and under the direction of Dr. August Raspet of the AeroPhysics Research Laboratory of Mississippi State University, where Johnson was an Aeronautical Engineering student, he measured the glide ratio performance of the initial design at 33-to-1. With the help of Dr. Raspet, Johnson made several modifications which in 1951 resulted in a better than 40 to 1 glide ratio - the first sailplane to achieve that milestone. At Dr. Raspet's suggestion, the name was changed to the RJ-5. Dick Johnson flew the RJ-5 to win the US Open Class Nationals in 1950, 51, 52 and 54, to break the World Distance Record in 1951 and to break the 100 km Triangle World Speed Record in 1952. The World Distance flight of from Odessa, Texas to Salina, Kansas was the first glider flight to exceed 500 miles and broke the previous world record by . This record held for 12 years, until broken by Al Parker in a Sisu 1A glider that used a more refined laminar flow airfoil. The RJ-5 has been restored and is on display at the National Soaring Museum in Elmira, New York. == Flight test evaluations == Dick Johnson wrote more than 100 articles for Soaring magazine, consisting mostly of the Flight Test Evaluation series starting in 1976, which measured the performance of sailplanes utilizing the measurement methods taught by Dr Raspet and refined by Johnson. Funded by the Dallas Gliding Association, which did not have any financial ties to sailplane manufacturers, Johnson's evaluations were considered an unbiased evaluation and were reprinted in multiple languages and collected into book form. In addition to measuring the sailplane performance as received, these evaluations documented opportunities for measurable performance improvements such as wing smoothing, improved wing seals, turbulator inducing strips, and deturbulator strips. == Death == Dick Johnson died July 23, 2008, at age 85. He was flying a Ventus A glider from a Midlothian, Texas airportJoe Simnacher (July 28, 2008). \\"Richard H. \\"Dick\\" Johnson: Glider pilot soared for nearly 70 years\\", Dallas Morning News via legacy.com. Retrieved January 22, 2014 when it crashed about 2.25 miles (3.5 km) from the airport after flying for some time. The Medical Examiner of Dallas County determined that Johnson died from the injuries he received in the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board determined the probable accident cause to be an incapacitating cardiac event, as Johnson had severe coronary artery disease with symptoms and had been prescribed medication for it. == Gliding awards received == *F.A.I.

Remained an active consultant to a variety of companies through 2008. His projects were: *Paveway Laser Guided Bomb (LGB)- At TI in 1964 Johnson was instrumental in developing the aeronautical solutions for the initial laser-guided bomb, the BOLT GBU-1, including the unique floating \\"birdie head\\" which provided a stable platform for the \\"smart bomb\\" guidance system. The \\"Bolt\\" was followed by the Paveway I and Paveway II family of laser-guided bombs. The success of the Paveway guided systems during the Vietnam War showed the advantages for surgical strike capabilities of a \\"smart bomb\\". Johnson received TI's Pat Haggerty Innovation Award for work on that project. *High Speed Anti Radar Missile (HARM) 1973, involved in airframe development *Javelin Anti-Tank Missile 1980, lead airframe development *Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW) unmanned military glider 1987, lead airframe development *NLOS (Non Line of Sight) Weapon-lead airframe development *Paveway III- GBU-24, GBU-27 and GBU-28 (\\"Bunker Buster\\")- lead airframe development Posthumously received the Richard H. Johnson Technical Achievement Award from the Precision Strike Association at the PSA Technical Symposium in October 2009. This award was created in his name to recognize an individual from the public or private sector for outstanding personal technical achievement resulting in significant contribution to precision strike systems. The PSA's documentation for this award indicates that \\"Dick Johnson personally led the design or redesign of more precision strike airframes than any contemporary. In a number of conflicts over the past two decades, the majority of weapon airframes were Johnson's designs. His innovative designs, or copies of them, appear in nearly every nation's military where precision strike systems are employed.\\" == References == *Wings Like Eagles, The Story of Soaring in the United States, by Paul A.

After the completion of the ticket book case (Maguire v SOCOG 1999 ) on 30 September 1999, conciliation on the remaining matters was attempted but by 29 November 1999, the talks failed. ==Maguire v SOCOG 2000 (HREOC)== Maguire v Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission), No. H 99/115, 11 August 2000 (hearing), 24 August 2000 (decision). The commissioner, on 25 February 2000, notified the two parties about resuming the inquiry on 27 March 2000. On that day 27 March, SOCOG in a direction conference agreed to provide the Souvenir programme to Maguire in braille. ===Seeking information=== From 27 March 2000 to 4 August 2000, several direction conferences and letters from Maguire's solicitor to SOCOG solicitor asking SOCOG to provide information in order for Mr Worthington and Ms Treviranus who were experts in computers and adaptive technology to complete their assessment did not result in the experts receiving the complete amount of information. In providing Mr Worthington and Ms Treviranus with incomplete information, SOCOG maintained that the HTML source code was commercially sensitive to SOCOG and its contractor IBM. The complete information that was sought was \\"a sample page in electronic format from the proposed Results Table on the SOCOG website relating to the Olympic Games and the Paralympic website\\" (the latter request was abandoned upon advice by SOCOG that it was not involved in the organisation of the Paralympic Games); the current content plan for the Olympic website; the number of templates to be used; the details of the tools used to generate the pages of the Olympic website; and detailed calculations of certain \\"ball park\\" figures.\\" ===Jurisdiction=== At the 3 July hearing, SOCOG presented the amended legislation effective from 13 April 2000 that transferred complaint hearing powers from HREOC to the Federal Court. The commissioner felt that the amendment did not apply because of 31 August 1999 directions. SOCOG sought Federal Court review of the commissioner's ruling,, Maguire v Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games [2000] FCA 1112 (3 August 2000), 11 August 2000, Federal Court of Australia, last visited on Friday 29 August 2008, 9:57pm, \\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/federal_ct/2000/1112.html\\" . but on 3 August 2000, the Federal court dismissed the case. ===Number of complaints=== A witness statement submitted on 1 May 2000 confirmed that Maguire accessed SOCOG's website on 17 April 2000 and found some changes to the website but some other areas remained inaccessible. The witness statement asked for \\"That SOCOG include ALT text on all images and image map links on the website; That SOCOG ensure access from the Schedule page to the Index of Sports; and That SOCOG ensure access to the Results Tables on the web site during the Olympic Games.\\" . SOCOG used this statement to argue that the April 2000 complaint was different from the June 1999 complaint. The commissioner maintained that SOCOG's website was inaccessible and did not meet the W3C guidelines on accessibility. It was noted that SOCOG on 27 July 2000 provided Maguire information of URL addresses of each of the 37 individual sports to access the index of sports from the schedule. Even though the original complaint was general which was then particularised for the three areas, the commissioner felt the April 2000 and the June 1999 complaints were the same. ===Service=== SOCOG argued that the promotional material of the website was not included by the DDA 1992 definition of \\"service\\". The commissioner declared that the provision of information was included by the Section 4 definition of \\"service\\" which made Section 24 valid., DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT 1992 - SECT 4 Interpretation, 25 August 2008, Australasian Legal Information Institute, last visited on Friday 29 August 2008, 6:48pm, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s4.html ., DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT 1992 - SECT 24 Goods, services and facilities, 25 August 2008, Australasian Legal Information Institute, last visited on Friday 29 August 2008, 6:43pm, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s24.html . ===Treated less favourably=== SOCOG submitted that there was not any direct discrimination as Maguire in using the website was not treated less favourably than a sighted person. The incompletion of adding ALT texts and an imperfect mode access that should not be attempted by a sighted person were reasons that caused the commissioner to find that SOCOG in providing services in a manner accessible to sighted persons but inaccessible or partially accessible to a blind person violated section 5 and 24 of DDA 1992, DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT 1992 - SECT 5>[ Disability discrimination, 25 August 2008, Australasian Legal Information Institute, last visited on Saturday 30 August 2008, 9:30pm, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s5.html. and. Additionally, the commissioner found that SOCOG violated Section 6 by imposing a requirement that Maguire should be able to read print, with which a substantially greater proportion of persons without Maguire's disability was able to comply., DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT 1992 - SECT 6 Indirect disability discrimination, 25 August 2008, Australasian Legal Information Institute, last visited on Friday 29 August 2008, 8:35pm, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s6.html. ===Unjustifiable hardship=== SOCOG said that it did not discriminate unlawfully against Maguire but if it did, that the cost and effort in retraining staff and redrawing entire development methods was an unjustifiable hardship in providing an accessible website., DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT 1992 - SECT 11 Unjustifiable hardship, 25 August 2008, Australasian Legal Information Institute, last visited on Friday 29 August 2008, 6:43pm, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s11.html. SOCOG argued that the Table of Results is composed of data sourced from a number of different databases of results for each of 37 sporting disciplines; the site consists currently of 6,000 pages and approximately 55,000 pages will be generated during the course of the Games; there are 37 sports webpage templates each with approximately 35 result templates ‚Äì in total 1,295 templates for results alone; the tables of results will contain \\"wrapped text within cells\\"; there will be approximately six billion \\"hits\\" on the site and the site needs to be fast and very responsive; to reformat the site and its contents in a way which will make the website accessible to the complainant will in effect require the development of a new or separate website; extensive changes to infrastructure are required; there is a requirement for specialised skills which are limited and expensive; there will be possible adverse effects upon the support and maintenance systems; one person working 8-hour business days would require 368 days to complete the task properly; $2.2 million of additional infrastructure would be required to separately host the additional designs necessary to an accessible Table of Results. However, Maguire with expert witnesses argued that the number of templates is significantly less than 1,295 and the reformatting of the templates will require considerably less than the two hours for each alleged by SOCOG; a more realistic estimate for the minor changes required is ten minutes each; nor is there the need for unique manually generated formats; no new infrastructure will be required because it is allegedly extant; a team of one experienced developer with a group of 5-10 assistants could provide an accessible site to Level A compliance in four weeks; wrapping in each cell can be met by using a simple device namely the inclusion of an invisible end of cell character which would indicate to a blind person the end of the text in each cell; the cost of making the site accessible is a modest amount; the number of templates has been estimated at 357 for 28 sports. Additional templates would be required for 37. Because of the failure of respondent to supply the information requested by letter on 31 March 2000 the number of templates has been estimated. The expert witnesses of Maguire who provided months of advice convinced the commissioner more than the expert witnesses of SOCOG who provided days of advice just before the August hearing. Despite conflicting arguments stated above, the Commissioner found that SOCOG who had unlawfully discriminated in violation of the DDA, delayed the final determination of that complaint of the commissioner and took advantage of matters consequential upon that delay in order to support its alleged inability to cure its problem. ===Final decision=== The Commissioner found that SOCOG had engaged in unlawful discrimination against Maguire in violation of Section 24 of the DDA 1992. SOCOG was ordered to render its website accessible including ALT text on all images and image map links on its website; providing access to the Index of Sports from the Schedule page; and providing access to the Results Tables to be used on the website during the Sydney Olympic Games by 15 September 2000. Failure on SOCOG's part to comply with that order would give Maguire the option to press for compensation. == Bruce Lindsay Maguire v.

The Commissioner found that SOCOG only partially complied and as a result, by section 103(1)(b)(iv) of the DDA, the commissioner awarded Maguire $20,000., Bruce Lindsay Maguire v.

His parents, Jefferson and Allison, raised him and his two sisters, Honor and Paige, in the New York City suburbBotelho, Greg; Hinojosa, Maria. \\"The man in the red bandana\\". CNN. of Nyack, New York. Through his father, he was a grandson of Bosley Crowther, film critic of The New York Times from 1940 to 1967. As a child, Crowther saw his father getting dressed for church and wrapping a small comb in a blue or red bandana he kept in his right hip pocket. When Welles was six years old, his father gave him a red bandana that would become Crowther's trademark, one that Crowther would wear under all of his sports uniforms in high school. At 16, Crowther joined his father as a volunteer firefighter, becoming a junior member of the Empire Hook and Ladder Company. He later attended Boston College, where he played lacrosse, In 1999, Crowther graduated with honors with a degree in economics. He subsequently moved to New York City, taking a job as an equities trader for Sandler O'Neill and Partners, settling into an office on the 104th floor of South Tower of the World Trade Center. He later entertained dreams of joining the FDNY or the FBI or CIA. ==September 11 attacks== On September 11, 2001, nine minutes after United Airlines Flight 175 struck the South Tower between floors 77 and 85 at 9:03 a.m.,\\"9/11 Timeline\\". History. Retrieved March 6, 2019.(Untitled). The National 9/11 Pentagon Memorial. Retrieved March 6, 2019. Crowther called his mother from his office at 9:12 a.m., leaving the message, \\"Mom, this is Welles. I wanted you to know that I'm OK.\\" Crowther made his way to the 78th- floor sky lobby, where he encountered a group of survivors, including a badly burned Ling Young, who worked on the 86th floor in New York's Department of Taxation and Finance. Young had been one of about 200 people waiting at a bank of elevators to evacuate when the plane hit the tower and was one of the few survivors. Crowther, carrying a young woman on his back, directed them to the one working stairway. The survivors followed him 17 floors down, where he dropped off the woman he was carrying before heading back upstairs to assist others. By the time he returned to the 78th floor, he had a bandana around his nose and mouth to protect him from smoke and haze. He found another group of survivors, which included AON Corp. employee Judy Wein, who worked on the 103rd floor and was in pain from a broken arm, cracked ribs and a punctured lung. According to Wein, Crowther assisted in putting out fires and administering first aid. He then announced to that group, \\"Everyone who can stand, stand now. If you can help others, do so.\\" He directed this group downstairs as well. As occupants of the Tower headed for the street, Crowther returned up the stairs to help others. He was last seen doing so with members of the FDNY before the South Tower collapsed at 9:59 a.m. Crowther's body was found in March 2002, alongside several firefighters and emergency workers bunched in a suspected command post in the South Tower lobby. The New York medical examiner's office said his body was found intact, with no signs of burns, and that authorities speculated that he was aiding the rescue effort as a civilian usher when the building collapsed. Crowther's family was unaware of the details of his activities between his last phone call to his mother and his death, until Allison Crowther read Judy Wein's firsthand account in The New York Times of being saved by a man in a red bandana, which led to Allison meeting with the people Welles had saved, including Wein and Young. They confirmed from photographs the identity of the man who aided them. According to survivor accounts, Crowther saved as many as 18 people following the attacks. ==Legacy== Crowther‚Äôs name is located on Panel S-50 of the National September 11 Memorial‚Äôs South Pool. Crowther's parents, with the support of a Michigan foundation, created the Red Bandana Project, a character-development program for classrooms, sports teams, camps and youth programs. The family also established the Welles Remy Crowther Charitable Trust, with which they fund charitable work.Lerner, Jane (May 15, 2014). \\"At 911 memorial, Obama evokes red bandanna\\".

That same year, Crowther's Boston College lacrosse teammate, Tyler Jewell, wore a red bandana in honor of Crowther when he competed as a member of the United States snowboarding team in the 2006 Winter Olympics. During the September 10, 2011, UCF-Boston College football game in Orlando, Florida, a day before the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, both schools honored Crowther. Boston College players wore helmet stickers featuring Crowther's signature red bandana during the game, and Crowther's sisters, Honor Fagan and Paige Crowther, were introduced to the crowd during the third quarter.

President Barack Obama, during his May 15, 2014, dedication of the museum, said of Crowther, \\"They didn't know his name. They didn't know where he came from. But they knew their lives had been saved by the man in the red bandana. He called for fire extinguishers to fight back the flames. He tended to the wounded. He led those survivors down the stairs to safety, and carried a woman on his shoulders down 17 flights. Then he went back. Back up all those flights. Then back down again, bringing more wounded to safety. Until that moment when the tower fell.\\" One of Crowther's bandanas is on display at the museum.Dooley, Erin ;Bruce, Mary (May 15, 2014). \\"President Obama Recounts 9/11 Heroism of 'Man in the Red Bandana'\\".

It took place on 23 May 1462. ==Background== In 1460, after John II imprisoned Charles of Viana, the Catalans at the Corts de Lleida formed the Council of the Principality (Consell del Principat) in opposition to the government of John in the Principality of Catalonia. The Consell demanded that John liberate Charles immediately and accept the Capitulation of Vilafranca, which prohibited John from entering Catalonia without the permission of the Generalitat so long as he disagreed with their legislation.Pedres de Girona, El setge de la For√ßa del 1462. John capitulated. The subsequent death of Charles only three weeks after his liberation threatened the peace. The king sent his wife, Joana Enr√≠quez, to Barcelona with the intention of overturning the capitulation and sowing discord among the Catalan factions.Hiperenciclop√®dia catalana ECSA, Carles d'Arag√≥ (o de Viana). The relationship between the queen and the representatives of the Catalan government was strained during the six months she was in Barcelona with her son, Charles' successor as heir, Ferdinand. In March 1462 the queen and the prince left for Girona, while the pagesos de remen√ßa revolted against the government in hopes of receiving royal support and abolishing the mals usos. ==Leadup to battle== At Girona the queen convoked a general council on 23 April 1462. She reorganised the citizen militia and proceeded to repair the city's walls and towers.Ciutat de Girona, Girona al segle XV. On 12 May she sent a force of 200 men to Bernat Joan de Cabrera, head of the garrison of Hostalric. On 13 May the Consell del Principat sent an ambassador to the castle to assure that the council's army, which was marching on Girona, would be well received. In a final preparation for battle, Joana sealed an alliance with the leader of the remences, Francesc de Verntallat. The rebels agreed to bar the pass of the Consell's army at Hostalric, while Joana sent 600 men to reinforce the remences. A ship of arms and food was sent to Sant Feliu de Gu√≠xols to gain time as the remences organised themselves. ==Siege== The army of the Consell was commanded by captain Pere de Bell-lloc i de Sentmenat.Consell comarcal de la Selva. After easily frightening the remences of Verntallat into retreat on 23 May, Pere besieged Hostalric.Mapa de les operacions remences. The remences fled to Girona. To impress upon the town the urgency of surrender, Pere began destroying the surrounding vineyards and wheat fields. The townspeople opened the gates to the Consell and the town fell without a fight. The castle too was surrendered without combat, but the Tower of Friars, defended by a single man, was attacked by the crossbowmen. Bernat Joan de Cabrera was taken prisoner. On 29 May the Consell sent the remainder of their army stationed at Barcelona to besiege Girona. Hostalric remained a stronghold of the Consell until the end of the war. ==ReferencesBibliography== *Sobrequ√©s, Santiago and Jaume Sobrequ√©s (1987).

It was founded by Edward Bradford Titchener in 1904 to be an ongoing workshop in which members could visit labs, study apparatus, and hear and comment on reports of ongoing research. Upon Titchener‚Äôs death in 1927 the club was reorganized and renamed the Society of Experimental Psychologists. The object of the society is ‚ÄúTo advance psychology by arranging informal conferences on experimental psychology.‚ÄùAbout the SEP The SEP meets annually to conduct plenary sessions in which members can present papers. It holds meetings every spring, scheduled by a member at the host university who serves as the chair of the SEP for that year. The meetings are open to all members and to students and faculty from the host university who are invited by the chair. Membership in the SEP is by invitation only and is considered to be a great honor because it represents significant accomplishment in the field of experimental psychology. The SEP currently admits at least 6 new members annually from among the leading experimentalists in North America. It has a current membership of 220 individuals, about 5 - 10% of the practicing experimental psychologists. The SEP confers three awards: * The Howard Crosby Warren Medal, endowed to recognize individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the field of experimental psychology during the previous five years. * The Norman Anderson Lifetime Achievement Award, endowed to recognize individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the field of Experimental Psychology over the course of their lifetimes. * The Early Investigator Award, created to recognize individuals who have made significant contributions to the field of experimental psychology early in their careers. ==References * Official Website of the SEP * Fellows of the SEP Category:Experimental psychology Category:Psychological societies Category:Psychology organizations based in the United States ","title":"Society of Experimental Psychologists"},{"id":"19308330","text":"During World War II, the United States Navy had a large contingent of operations based on land. ==Academies== * Naval Academy Preparatory School, Bainbridge, Maryland ==Advisors== * Naval Advisor, War Production Board Office, Baltimore, Maryland * Naval Advisor to Contract Distribution, Branch Office, War Production Board.

Hocking was primarily a knock ruckman but could also play most positions around the ground. He made his debut at Collingwood in the 1938 VFL season and was a losing Grand Finalist in his first two seasons. In 1950 he was appointed club captain and he remained in the role the following year, leading Collingwood to a Preliminary Final which they lost to Essendon by two points. Hocking was a regular interstate representative for Victoria and starred at the 1950 Brisbane Carnival. That year he was named as a half back flanker in the Sporting Life Team of the Year. Hocking retired during the 1952 VFL season, the last remaining pre-World War II VFL player.Piesse, p. 142. ==ReferencesSources== * Bolfo, Tony, \\"200 Club push for 'Mulga', Baxter and Bob\\", Carlton Football Club, 14 March 2017. * Holmesby, R. and Main, J.

It was released in 1988. The song, \\"Bye Mam√°\\", is loosely based on Guzm√°n's childhood. It talks about the star life of her mother, Silvia Pinal, and how she was not there most of the time when she was growing up. When her mother first heard the song, she was furious at her daughter and did not talk to her for some time. The song \\"La Plaga\\" was originally sung by Alejandra's father Enrique Guzm√°n and is a Spanish cover of \\"Good Golly Miss Molly\\".

Hatzalah is an all volunteer Emergency medical services organization staffed by Jewish Orthodox Emergency medical technicians and Paramedics. Locations where chapters are situated are listed alphabetically by geography. Each neighborhood or city in Hatzalah operates independently. There are some exceptions, where there is a tight affiliation with neighboring Hatzalahs, a loose affiliation of neighboring Hatzalahs, or some other basic level of co-operation. ==Argentina== *Buenos Aires (covering Once, Flores, Palermo, Barracas, Belgrano) ==Australia== *Melbourne *Sydney ==Austria== *Vienna ==Belgium== *Antwerp ==Brazil== *S√£o Paulo (covering Jardim Paulista, Higien√≥polis, Bom Retiro) ==Canada== A marked and an unmarked unit responding in Toronto *Montreal, Quebec *Kiryas Tosh, Boisbriand, Quebec *Toronto, Ontario ==Israel== Ichud Hatzalah rapid response scooter parked in Geula, Jerusalem. Hatzalah in Israel, on the national level, exists as two different organizations: Tzevet Hatzolah, and Ichud Hatzalah (rendered in English as United Hatzalah). Hatzolah Israel was the original organization, under the leadership of David \\"Duki\\" Greenwald. In 2006, Ichud Hatzalah was launched as competing organization with Hatzolah Israel, which eventually led Hatzolah Israel to declare bankruptcy. Many Hatzolah Israel volunteers who were dissatisfied with the actions of Ichud Hatzalah's leadership objected to joining the organization, and launched their own organization called Tzevet Hatzolah (loosely translated to TEAM Hatzolah). While Tzevet Hatzolah volunteers provide both emergency first responder care and emergency transport utilizing Magen David Adom ambulances, Ichud Hatzalah only provides first responder care and rely on Magen David Adom for emergency transport. Each of the organizations has many local chapters, and provides coordinated response for larger emergencies or extra coverage across multiple localities. Additionally, there are several smaller Hatzolah organizations which operate on the local level. A partial list can be found below. *Beit Shemesh (unaffiliated; only service to provide both first response and ambulance transportation) *Har Nof (affiliated with MDA, named HaChovesh, instead of Hatzolah) *Gush Dan (out of Bnei Brak, greater Tel Aviv area, including: Ra'anana, Herzliya, Netanya; unaffiliated) ==Mexico== Chevra Hatzalah Mexico was founded in 1997 by Mr. Chaim Silver. The branch is run by the Syrian- Sephardic community under supervision of Mr. Abraham Levy who is the CEO. It has 70 full-time volunteers, seven ambulances and six locations (five bases and a headquarters). It also has access to a helicopter and air transport. All dispatchers are Volunteer EMS for immediate intervention and instructions, some of them certified in Advanced Critical Care Medicine and Emergency response, actually working for prestigious Mexican Hospitals and National Medical Centers. Volunteers have plenty of experience in Trauma and Internal Medicine emergencies, having training in the Mexican Red Cross¬¥s Ambulance Center. The branch covers the Jewish areas of Tecamachalco, Bosques, Polanco, Interlomas, and the weekend resort city Cuernavaca. It has full-time operating bases in three major Jewish areas, having its Central Base in Tecamachalco, a dense populated Jewish area in Mexico City.http://www.hatzalah.com.mx/ *Mexico City ==Russia== *Moscow ==South Africa== *Johannesburg Alt URL ==Switzerland== *Zurich ==United Kingdom== * North London *North West London *Edgware London's Hatzalah itself is split into three sister organisations, one operating in Golders Green area, known as Hatzola North West, and the other based in Stamford Hill, known as North London Hatzola, with the newest addition in Edgware. *Gateshead *Manchester ==Ukraine== * Kiev ==United StatesCalifornia=== Los Angeles has a chapter which provides Basic life support level care, and relies on the Los Angeles Fire Department for Advanced life support paramedic care and transport. On August 31, 2009, they began direct transport of patients to area hospitals using their own ambulance. *Los Angeles Covering Hancock Park / Fairfax, Pico-Robertson / Beverly wood / Beverly Hills, and Valley Village / North Hollywood. *San Fernando Valley ===Connecticut=== The Orthodox community in Waterbury, CT, centered around the yeshiva there, has its own Hatzolah. *Waterbury, CT ===Florida=== Since January 2010, Miami-Dade has a chapter that provides Basic life support response, and relies on Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Department and Miami Beach Fire Rescue Department for Advanced life support paramedic care and transport. *Miami Covers areas of unincorporated North East Miami-Dade County, as well as select portions of the city of North Miami Beach, the city of Aventura, the city of Surfside, Bal Harbour, Bay Harbor, and central Miami Beach. ===Illinois=== Hatzalah Chicago started by providing first responder coverage for Lincolnwood, Peterson Park, Skokie, and West Rogers Park. *Chicago Hatzalah of Chicago purchased 2 ambulances, and they now transport. As of January 2018, Hatzalah Chicago purchased a third ambulance, and started providing Advanced Life Support (ALS) service to the Chicago community. ===Maryland=== Baltimore started a Hatzalah in 2007 as a first-responder-only service, with transport to be done by Baltimore City ambulance units. Currently, Hatzalah of Baltimore does maintain a fleet of four ambulances, and provides Advanced Life Support (ALS) services to the Northwest Baltimore community, provided it is in their response area. *Baltimore ===New Jersey=== New Jersey has many Hatzolah organizations throughout the State. Each NJ affiliate maintains its own emergency phone number, dispatchers, and radio frequencies. While they are not officially connected, as with NYC Hatzolah, many of them are nevertheless loosely affiliated, sharing classes or working at each other's events. On occasion, all six state divisions have worked together to provide joint event coverage or to share training classes. Per New Jersey law, volunteers with proper permits may equip their cars with blue flashing lights and electronic airhorns, but not red flashing lights, nor sirens. Coordinators' (\\"officers\\") personal vehicles, and any vehicle owned by a squad with a \\"No Fee\\" license plate, are permitted the use of red flashing lights and sirens; not all branches make use of these allowances. Paramedic (ALS) units in New Jersey are only run by hospitals, per state law. The limitation to BLS is not just for Hatzolah and other volunteer agencies: All New Jersey \\"911\\" municipal-run EMS services are also limited to BLS. However, see Central Jersey below for a special exception. *North Jersey This chapter covers the entire North Jersey region, with mutual aid to neighboring regions of New Jersey. Hatzolah EMS of North Jersey has several ambulances, agency response vehicles, and a rescue truck. *Jersey Shore This chapter covers the areas of Deal, West Deal, Long Branch, Eatontown, Alenhurst, Ocean Township, and additional Jersey Shore communities during warmer months. This is the only Sephardic-run Hatzalah in the United States. (Mexico City, Mexico, also has a Sephardic Hatzalah.) *Elizabeth / Hillside Hatzalah of Union County, with \\"U-prefix\\" unit numbers. Union County is geographically and organizationally separate from Union City. With three active ambulances, \\"the U\\" also responds to nearby towns, including Linden, Union Township, Roselle, and Roselle Park, and even to businesses and residences in the city of Newark, where slow EMS response may allow the Hatzalah ambulance to complete the 12-14 minute trip from Elizabeth or Hillside before a Newark city crew arrives. In early 2014, efforts were started to have \\"in-house\\" responders answer calls within the confines of the City of Newark, calling itself Hatzalah of Newark. Hatzalah of Union County also covers the Jersey Gardens Mall, Newark Liberty Airport, and nearby stretches of the New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway. Two ambulances are located in the greater Elizabeth / Hillside area, and the third is located in Roselle. *Edison / Highland Park Hatzolah of Middlesex County http://www.hatzolahmc.org/, with \\"MC-prefix\\" unit numbers. Middlesex County is a county located in North-Central New Jersey. It launched on November 16, 2014. At this time, their primary areas of response are Edison (including Raritan Center), Highland Park, Piscataway, and portions of East Brunswick. For events in various hotels, they have responded to Somerset as well. *Central Jersey (formerly Lakewood) The largest branch in New Jersey, with \\"CJ-prefix\\" unit numbers. Unique to New Jersey, Central Jersey has a Paramedic (ALS) unit. The ALS unit is owned and run by MONOC, but the Paramedics are also Central Jersey Hatzolah members, and the ambulance was donated by Hatzolah Central Jersey to MONOC. This unusual arrangement meets New Jersey's strict hospital-based ALS rules, while giving Hatzolah its own ALS coverage. Also unique, Central Jersey has its own Rescue (extrication) unit. Lakewood Township \\\\- Toms River \\\\- Brick \\\\- Jackson \\\\- Howell *Essex County (Newark) Formerly Hatzalah of Newark, EMS http://hatzalahofnewark.org/ with the \\"N-prefix\\" unit numbers went live in 2015, and provides BLS service to the Newark community and surrounding areas, including Newark Liberty International Airport. ALS services, when needed, are dispatched by the local hospital.cIn September 2019, it has expanded, and is now called Hatzalah of Essex County. *Passaic / Clifton Hatzolah of Passaic / Clifton EMS. The neighboring cities have a contiguous Orthodox Jewish community, with most of the community and its institutions on the Passaic side. Likewise, Hatzolah of Passaic / Clifton, with \\"P-prefix\\" unit numbers, covers both parts of the community, but is primarily based in Passaic, with some members and management in Clifton. This Hatzolah is geographically near Union City, and can provide extra coverage for them. Hatzolah of Passaic / Clifton has 30 active members, 20 dispatchers, two active ambulances, and a third on stand-by, for a community of about 2,000 households. *Passaic / Clifton: **Hatzolah of Passaic / Clifton EMS *Union City Hatzolah of Union City http://www.hatzolahuc.com/, is run out of Mosded Sanz-Zviel, which is the center of the Chasidic community in Union City. It is the only Hasidic Hatzolah in New Jersey. Union City is located in Hudson County, and is not related to Union County. Union City uses VHF radios, while all other New Jersey chapters use UHF radios. *Union City (unrelated to Hatzolah of Union County) *Union County, sometimes referred to as Hatzalah of Elizabeth (unrelated to Hatzolah of Union City) ===New York=== Canarsie / Mill Basin The Canarsie / Mill Basin chapter was originally just the Canarsie division. As the Canarsie Orthodox neighborhood declined, and the Mill Basin one grew, Canarsie started taking more calls and members from nearby Mill Basin, and is now primarily a Mill Basin operation. Canarsie / Mill Basin also covers nearby Georgetown. There are parts of the Brooklyn neighborhood of Mill Basin that border Madison / Midwood / East Midwood; so, there is some overlap in coverage with Flatbush. Catskill Mountains This chapter is part of Central Hatzalah of New York City. While the Catskills have a year-round operation, the vast majority of their activity is in July and August, when summer residents arrive. Fleischmanns Kiryas Joel/Monroe The Hasidic community in Kiryas Joel (Monroe), NY, has a chapter. Uniquely, it operates separately from all other New York State Hatzolah organizations. It was founded in 1995. Monroe, NY New Square This chapter is a break-off from the Rockland Hatzoloh chapter. Uniquely, the chapter has female Certified First Responders who respond to calls involving obstetrics-related emergencies. New York City Central Upper East Side division ambulances This chapter has sixteen local divisions which share rabbinic counsel, radio frequencies, central dispatch, and lobbying, but have separate fund-raising and management. Catskills, the Five Towns, and Yonkers are the only areas outside of New York City covered by NYC chapters. The chapter has a central dispatching network, with teams of 2 volunteer dispatchers working in tandem. Each dispatch team works several hours on a shift. The chapter also uses a mobile command center for dealing with large events. New York City chapters include Boro Park, Canarsie / Mill Basin, Crown Heights, Flatbush, Lower East Side, Midtown, Queens, Richmond, Riverdale, Rockaways / Lawrence, Seagate, Staten Island, Upper East Side, Upper West Side, Washington Heights, and Williamsburg. *Borough Park This chapter covers Kensington, Bensonhurst, Sunset Park, and sometimes Ditmas Park. *Canarsie. This chapter covers Canarsie, Flatlands, Georgetown, and Mill Basin, and is based in Mill Basin A Crown Heights division ambulance *Crown Heights *Flatbush. This chapter covers the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Midwood, East Midwood, Madison, and Gravesend. The extended area includes Brighton Beach, Manhattan Beach, Ditmas Park, and Kensington, and, occasionally, Bensonhurst. *Lower East Side Manhattan (below 34th Street) *Midtown Manhattan *Queens, including Great Neck and JFK Airport *Richmond, Staten Island. This chapter covers the neighborhood of Willowbrook. *Riverdale. This chapter covers Riverdale, parts of Yonkers, in Westchester County, and extended regions of the Bronx. *Rockaway - Nassau County *Rockaway / Lawrence. This chapter covers the Rockaways and Lawrence, Arverne, Atlantic Beach, Bayswater, Belle Harbor, Cedarhurst, East Rockaway, Far Rockaway, Hewlett, Inwood, Kennedy Airport, Lawrence, Long Beach, North Woodmere, Rosedale, and Woodmere. *Sea Gate *Staten Island *Upper East Side Manhattan (34th street to 125th street Central Park / 5th Ave to East River) *Upper West Side Manhattan, *Washington Heights *Williamsburg (founding chapter) Rockland County This chapter is unaffiliated with the New York Central Hatzolah. It has distinct rabbinical oversight, primarily due to several large Hasidic communities affiliated with Rockland Hatzolah. Westchester County ===Pennsylvania=== Philadelphia's Hatzolah has limited service, providing first responder aid only in the Northeast area. Hatzolah of Philadelphia transports are provided by calling in either Patriot Ambulance, or, when the situation warrants, 9-1-1. Patriot Ambulance is a local paid ambulance service owned by a community member. Philadelphia has nine responders, all state-certified. Some members are full-time professional EMTs or Paramedics. After the press release in the Yeshiva World News, several comments were posted that required a detailed explanation of the Mission of Philadelphia branch. One of the main questions was the relationship between Hatzolah of Philadelphia and Local EMS Agencies.

The adaptation is directed by Oliver Parker, written by Toby Finlay (his first screenplay), and stars Ben Barnes as Dorian Gray and Colin Firth as Lord Henry Wotton. It tells the story of the title character, an attractive Englishman whose image is captured in an enchanted painting that keeps him from aging. His portrait becomes tainted with every sin he commits, while he remains young and handsome. The film, which was released in the United Kingdom on 9 September 2009, competed in the Official Fant√†stic Competition at the 2009 Sitges Film Festival.\\"Line Up :: Official Fant√†stic In Competition Selection\\". Sitges Film Festival. 9 May 2009. ==Plot== When a naive young Dorian Gray arrives in late Victorian London, by train, to inherit an estate left to him by his abusive grandfather, he is swept into a social whirlwind by the charismatic Lord Henry \\"Harry\\" Wotton, who introduces Gray to the hedonistic pleasures of the city. Lord Henry's friend, society artist Basil Hallward, paints a portrait of Gray to capture the full power of his youthful beauty. When the portrait is unveiled, Gray makes a flippant pledge: he would give anything to stay as he is in the picture‚Äîeven his soul. Gray meets and falls in love with budding young actress, Sibyl Vane. After a few weeks, he proposes marriage to her. Lord Henry tells Gray that having children is \\"the beginning of the end\\", and after the two men visit a brothel, Gray leaves Sibyl. Heartbroken, the young woman commits suicide by drowning. Gray learns of her death the following day from her brother, James (\\"Jim\\"), who also reveals that Sybil was pregnant with Gray's child. Enraged, Jim tries to kill Gray before being restrained and carried off by the authorities. Gray's initial grief soon disappears as Lord Henry persuades him that all events are mere experiences and without consequence. His hedonistic lifestyle worsens, distancing him from a concerned Hallward. Gray returns home one evening to find that Hallward's portrait of him has become warped and twisted, and he soon realises that his off-hand pledge has come true; while the portrait ages, its owner's sins manifest as physical defects on the canvas. Before long, the curse imbued within Gray's portrait begins in earnest, resulting in Hallward's brutal murder after the artist reveals his secret. Gray dismembers and dumps Hallward's body in the River Thames, but the remains are soon recovered and eventually buried. Gray decides to leave London to travel the world and he invites Lord Henry to join him as his companion, but he declines, citing his wife's pregnancy. After a 25-year absence, Gray stuns everyone at the welcoming party with his unchanged youthful appearance. He also meets and soon becomes close to Lord Henry's daughter, Emily, a member of the UK suffragette movement, much to her father's disapproval. Although Gray appears genuinely interested in changing his ways as he spends time with Emily, matters are complicated when he is confronted by Jim, who continues to seek vengeance for his sister's death. Despite Gray's attempts to mislead Jim by pointing out his apparent age, Jim nevertheless deduces his true identity, but is killed by an oncoming train while pursuing Gray in the London Underground. Meanwhile, as Gray makes arrangements to leave London with Emily, Lord Henry's suspicions are confirmed when a study of old photographs triggers a memory where he jokingly suggested that Gray exchange his soul in return for eternal youth and beauty. Breaking into Gray's home, Lord Henry discovers the concealed portrait, but is intercepted by Gray before he can uncover it. As Gray attempts to convince him of the authenticity of his feelings for Emily, Lord Henry suddenly discovers the blood-stained scarf of Basil in a box. This prompts Gray to declare that he is the personification of the life Lord Henry fantasised but dared not pursue. Full of anger and grief, Gray attempts to strangle him but is distracted by Emily's call long enough for Lord Henry to knock him aside and expose the portrait. Disgusted and horrified at the twisted sight on the canvas, Lord Henry throws a lit lamp at the portrait, causing it to catch fire, and then locks the gate of the attic to ensure that Gray and the painting are destroyed. Emily pleads with Gray for the key, but Gray instead confesses his love for her and turns his back as Lord Henry drags his daughter out of the burning mansion. Resolving to end his suffering, Gray impales the painting with a poker, causing his body to age rapidly, before the attic is consumed by an explosion. A few months later, following a futile attempt to reconcile with Emily, Lord Henry heads to his attic where he keeps the portrait of Gray as it was when Hallward painted it, grimly noting that nobody will look at it now. As Lord Henry leaves, the portrait's eyes glow, implying that Gray's soul is still alive even after his death. ==Cast== Supporting parts are played by Pip Torrens as Victor, Gray's valet; Jo Woodcock as Lord and Lady Radley's daughter Celia; Max Irons as Lucius, a young man whom Gray assaults at a party for touching the key to the attic door; David Sterne as the theatre manager who first introduces Gray to Sibyl; and Douglas Henshall as Alan Campbell, an acquaintance of Gray's who is present when Jim Vane tries to strangle Gray. ==Production== The film began shooting in summer 2008 at Ealing Studios and locations across London and finished in October. The film received ¬£500,000 of National Lottery funding via the UK Film Council's Premiere Fund. ==Reception== The film received mixed reviews. , the film holds an approval rating of 44% on film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 39 reviews with an average rating of 5/10. The site's critical consensus states: \\"Despite a lavish and polished production, Dorian Gray is tame and uninspired with a lifeless performance by Ben Barnes in the title role.\\" ==See also== * Adaptations of The Picture of Dorian Gray ==References* * Category:2009 films Category:2009 horror films Category:2000s fantasy films Category:2009 LGBT- related films Category:2009 thriller drama films Category:British films Category:British drama films Category:British fantasy films Category:British horror films Category:British LGBT-related films Category:British thriller films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on The Picture of Dorian Gray Category:Films directed by Oliver Parker Category:Films set in 1891 Category:Films set in 1916 Category:Films set in London Category:Films shot in London Category:Gay-related films Category:LGBT-related drama films Category:LGBT-related horror films Category:LGBT-related thriller films Category:2009 drama films ","title":"Dorian Gray (2009 film)"},{"id":"19308641","text":"Hui'an maidens or Hui'an women () are a major Han Chinese subgroup that are a part of a distinct Han community residing in Hui'an County of Quanzhou, Fujian, China. They have a distinct dress and marital customs that have been the focus of both anthropologists and governmental censure. ==History== The Hui'an are categorized as Han Chinese as they speak Sinitic languages, adopted Han culture, and practise Chinese religions but their origin traces back to the ancient Minyue people of more than two thousand years ago. The isolation on the eastern peninsula of Hui'an prevented Hui'an maidens from completely assimilating into the Han culture, so many of their distinctive customs and traditions still survive today. Other Baiyue peoples who continue to retain a cultural distinction from the Han despite adopting many of their practises and now speak a Sinitic language include the Tanka people and Pinghua. ==Culture== Statue of Hui'an maidens, taken in Quanzhou, Fujian, China. === Costumes === Knitwear exhibition ONTRAFEL at the Modemuseum Antwerpen (MoMu), Belgium. The central design is a dress by Walter van Beirendonck, inspired by the colourful clothing of the Hui'an women. Typical Hui'an maidens wear short cyan jackets and skintight black hiphuggers which flare out at the legs and they cover their heads with colorful scarves and conical hats. === Marriage === Hui'an maidens have very distinct customs regarding their marriage. Newlyweds are not allowed to stay together on their wedding night, so the groom stays in a friend's house. On the second day, the bride pays respects to the groom's family and gives gifts to the elders. On the third day, the groom's sister leads the bride to the communal well to draw two buckets of water. After five days of obeying various customs, she returns to her parents' home. The bride and groom are forbidden to live together or even talk to each other until the bride bears a child. Younger generations no longer practice these customs. ===Religion=== The majority of the Hui'an people have the same religious practices as other Han Chinese. == References Bibliography= External links == * Hui'an Women * Beauty of Hui'an women * Hui'an Women's Clothing * Hui'an women's dance practice Category:Ethnic groups in China Category:Han Chinese Category:Hokkien culture ","title":"Hui'an maidens"},{"id":"19308643","text":"Ellsbury Township is a civil township in Barnes County, North Dakota, United States.

Stele as a remembrance of the abbey. ==History== The abbey was founded in either 1163 or 1165, either directly from Clairvaux Abbey in France, which is the more generally accepted account, or from Riddagshausen Abbey near Braunschweig, in which case Klaarkamp was of the filiation of Morimond. The abbey's daughter houses were Bloemkamp Abbey (founded c. 1190 near Bolsward), Aduard Abbey (founded 1192) and Gerka Abbey (founded 1240 in Gerkesklooster near Buitenpost). The monastery was engaged in brick production from the clay on its land, and employed hundreds of lay brothers in this work. The abbey's main estates were in Jannum, Sibrandah√ªs, Feanw√¢lden and on the island of Schiermonnikoog. It also owned a grange at Betterwird, apparently in Westdongeradeel. During the Reformation battles of the Eighty Years' War Friesland converted to Protestantism and secularised all its religious houses. On 31 May 1580 the abbey was dissolved and its assets confiscated by the state of Friesland. The buildings were sold off and demolished. In the 19th and early 20th centuries the mound, about 4 metres high, on which the monastery had stood was removed, and some excavation took place at that time. ==Premises and buildings== Nothing remains of the abbey buildings. The site is marked by a monolith. ==References== *Boersma: De voormalige abdij Klaarkamp bij Rinsumageest archeologisch verkend, Publikatieband Stichting Alde Fryske Tsjerken 2, 1978, pp. 77‚Äì88 *Mol, J.A.: Besitzerwerbungen der friesischen Zisterzienserkl√∂ster Klaarkamp, Bloemkamp und Gerkesklooster, in: K.

The football league is the smallest in the world, with only two clubs. The league is affiliated with The Football Association. ==History== In the 1920s, the Lyonnesse Inter-Island Cup, a competition between the islands of St. Mary's, Tresco, St. Martins, Bryher and St. Agnes, was formed. By the 1950s, only two clubs remained - the Rangers and the Rovers. In 1984 the two clubs changed their names to the Garrison Gunners and the Woolpack Wanderers, which are their current names. The League is attempting to get into the Guinness World Records for the smallest league in the world. In April 2008, Adidas ran an advertisement called \\"Dream Big\\", highlighting the league, featuring several well-known football personnel including David Beckham, Steven Gerrard and Patrick Vieira. ==Competition structure== Game in progress between the two teams - the Garrison Gunners in yellow, and the Woolpack Wanderers in red. The League competition involves the Woolpack Wanderers and the Garrison Gunners playing each other seventeen times, often on a Sunday. There also exist two Cups: The Wholesalers Cup and the Foredeck Cup, which is played over two legs. An \\"Old Men versus the Youngsters\\" match is played on Boxing Day. The season itself starts with the Charity Shield. All the matches are played on the Garrison football field, on the island of St. Mary's. The league is played during the winter, from mid-November until the end of March. Occasionally, a combined Scilly Isles team play Newlyn Non Athletico, a team at level 14 of the English football league system. A team from Truro visits annually to play against a combined team. ==Honours== The Woolpack Wanderers have won the Charity Cup 5 times - in 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007. In addition, they have won the Lioness Shield twice - in 2006 and 2007. The Garrison Gunners have won the Lioness Shield once, in 2005. ==Concerns== The Isles of Scilly are struggling to hold on to their young people. There is no sixth form on the Isles so when youngsters turn 16, they go to the mainland. In addition, house prices are expensive, so they tend not to return until much older. As a result, the number of players in the league is dwindling. In 2008 Howard Cole, a secretary who referees the games, estimated the average age of both teams to be within the mid- to late-30s. ==Junior League== In 2020, a Junior League was formed, also with only 2 teams: The Trenoweth Trailblazers and the Flying Falcons. ==References Category:Isles of Scilly Category:Football leagues in Cornwall ","title":"Isles of Scilly Football League"},{"id":"19308823","text":"\\"Everyday\\" is a ballad song by Phil Collins released as the second single of his fifth studio album, Both Sides. It was also released as the seventh track on the 2004 compilation album, Love Songs: A Compilation... Old and New. The single achieved success mostly in North America in the spring of 1994. ==Release== Due to the disappointing US performance of the first single of the album, \\"Both Sides of the Story\\", which only peaked at number 25 on Billboard Hot 100, Collins' record label urged the release of the second single. The decision proved right as the single peaked one place higher than \\"Both Sides\\", at number 24 on Billboard Hot 100. However, in Collins' native UK, \\"Everyday\\" performed worse than the previous single (which made the top 10), peaking at number 15.

Recruited from the small town of Garfield, Miller won the 1963 West Gippsland Football League goalkicking award with 121 goals. Miller, a full-forward, started his career at Carlton and showed glimpses of his prolific goalkicking in his two seasons, scoring five goals against Hawthorn in just his second game and managing a sequence of five, six and four goals during the 1964 season. Miller decided to leave Carlton midway in 1965 he returned to Garfield. In 1966 he set a West Gippsland league record of 148 goals. He joined VFA club Dandenong in 1967 and soon became a valuable member of the team playing at full forward. He kicked 106 goals in 1969. He was a member of Dandenong's 1971 premiership team, remembered for a controversial free kick that he received before the opening siren of the Grand Final. The umpire, having seen Preston full-back Barrie Leslie push Miller in the back, awarded a free kick despite the start of play not having been signalled. Miller kicked the goal and four quarters later Dandenong won by six points. Preston lodged a protest after the game and it went to a VFA hearing, with the final decision from the committee going in Dandenong's favour 39 votes to five. Miller was also a member of Dandenong's victorious 1967 Grand Final team. Miller was the leading goalkicker in the Association across the full season (including finals) six times over a seven-year span during his career: in 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1973 and 1974. He was also the leading goalkicker in the home-and- away season on four of those occasions; he was second in 1971 and third in 1973, but passed those ahead of him during the finals. In 1973, he kicked his career high 108 goals. When he retired early in the 1977 season, he had amassed 885 goals at an average of 4.8 per game. Miller became Captain-Coach of Berwick of the South West Gippsland Football League in 1977. In 1978 he kicked 201 goals for the season, the fourth man to achieve this feat. He stopped playing in 1981 after injuries hampered his last three seasons. The Jim 'Frosty' Miller Medal, awarded to the leading goalkicking in the modern day VFL, is named in his honour. He is a full-forward in Dandenong's official 'Team of the Century'. ==References * *Jim Miller profile from Blueseum ==Further reading== *Holmesby, Russell and Main, Jim (2007).

Progress) is the state-owned national daily newspaper published in Bamako, Mali. Its motto is \\"La Voix du Peuple\\" (\\"The Voice of the People). ==History== L'Essor was first published in 1949, and from 1953 was the official publication of the Union Soudanaise-Rassemblement D√©mocratique Africain, the leading anti-colonial political party of what was then French Soudan. Prior to independence, Bamako was home to a large number of such publications, produced by most political factions. Through the 1960s, most were outlawed, disbanded, or simply failed financially. Following the 1968 military coup, L'Essor became the organ of the CMLN, Mali's ruling junta. In 1979, as part of the move to civilian governance, the paper was transferred to the unitary political party of the former military rulers, the UDPM. During this period, largely due to better distribution and higher literacy, circulation grew from 12,000 daily (early 1970s) to over 40,000 (late 1980s).Imperato (1986), p. 267 Even after the fall of the Socialist government in 1968, the paper continued to carry articles from the Soviet and Chinese wire services, giving it an anti-Western slant. Most domestic writing prior to 1991 focused on local events and government decrees and speeches. Following the 1991 return to democracy, L'Essor was again transferred, this time to a new government owned printing and distribution house, the Malian Agency for Press and Publicity. While managed by the Malian Ministry of Communications & Information Technology, the AMP and L'Essor retain a high degree of independence from the government. ==Operations== L'Essor is one of 15 French language dailies published Mali. Most are printed in Bamako, and L'Essor alone retains a national reach. Its circulation is challenged only by the two largest French language private dailies, Les Echos and Nouvel Horizon. The AMAP has its own printing facilities, which also print government publications, including the \\"Journal Officiel\\" which publishes all official government pronouncement, debates, laws and regulations. L'Essor maintains a weekly, L'Essor H√©bdo, which focuses on social issues. Editorials in L'Essor come from the editorial staff and management, not the government, and press organisations have judged the paper to be largely free of government interference, a charge leveled at the state broadcaster ORTM.MSI Africa 2006-2007: Mali Journalists for L‚ÄôEssor itself have claimed there is self- censorship in dealing with those in power: \\"Since L‚ÄôEssor is governmentally owned, there are limits to what we can write about politics. But when it comes to social issues, we have a great freedom, there are no taboos.\\"Malian and Senegalese newspapers collaborate on many levels , RAP 21 Newsletter n¬∞ 57/2002, World Association of Newspapers L'Essor also has economic advantages, in that government ministries and state enterprises use its pages for their advertisements, for legal notices, and purchase newspaper subscriptions. On the other hand, it maintains reporters and distribution across the nation, tasks too expensive for private papers. All state printing and broadcast agencies receive government subsidies, and while private publishers an eligible for smaller subsidies, they must be assessed to have met certain financial, labour, bookkeeping, and distribution standards.This is under the 1992 article 7 of Decree No. 03- 264 /P-RM.

Considered one of Qatar's largest cities, it is the capital city of the municipality of Al Khor. The name of the city means creek in Arabic; it was given this name because the original settlement was built on a creek. Al Khor is home to many employees of the oil industry due to its proximity to Qatar's northern oil and natural gas fields and to Ras Laffan Industrial City. It is one of the proposed venues for the Qatar 2022 World Cup. ==History== Historically, Al Khor was ruled by the Al Muhannadi, a tribe which consists of several Bedouin families. According to oral tradition, Al Khor was first settled by the Al Muhannadi tribe in the late 18th century. The settlement expanded its borders after one of their hunting groups discovered a substantial water source near the coast in the mid-19th century. This led them to construct Ain Hleetan Well, which helped sustain the villagers' basic needs. Some locals believed that water obtained from Ain Hleetan possessed medicinal properties. In turn, the villagers built the Al Khor Towers around 1900, for the purpose of defending both the well and its harbor. In the 1820s, George Barnes Brucks carried out the first British survey of the Persian Gulf. He recorded the following notes about Al Khor, which he referred to as Khore Sheditch: \\"Khore Sheditch is a small boat harbour, to the southward of Ras Mut Buck, having from one and a half to two and a half fathoms water in it ; its entrance is in lat. 25¬∞ 40' 10' N., long. 51¬∞ 34' 50' E. The point at the entrance of Khore Aegarah is in lat. 25¬∞ 43' 10\\" N., long. 51¬∞ 36' 40\\" E. The Khore is small, having only one fathom in it.\\" File:Al Khor trigonometrical plan 1823.jpg‚ÄòTrigonometrical plan of Core Shedeitch [Khor Shaqiq] on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf‚Äô by G.B.

In October 2015, Ashghal (Public Works Authority) revealed that it would be investing billions of Qatari riyals into developing infrastructure in Al Khor. Its plan includes the creation of additional hospitals and schools, and the refurbishment of the road system. ==Geography== Qatar's capital, Doha, is located at a distance of 57 km to the south. Other distances include Umm Salal Ali ‚Äì 32 km to the south, Zubarah ‚Äì 46 km away, Madinat ash Shamal ‚Äì 47.2 km away, Al Wakrah ‚Äì 44.7 km away, and Dukhan ‚Äì 86.7 km away. Al Khor overlooks a sheltered bay upon which Al Khor Island (also known as Purple Island and Jazirat Bin Ghanim) lies. The width of the bay ranges from 2.2 to 6.5 km. It is linked to the open sea by a channel with a width of roughly 750 meters on its southern end. In a 2010 survey of Al Khor's coastal waters conducted by the Qatar Statistics Authority, it was found that its average depth was and its average pH was 8.11. Furthermore, the waters had a salinity of 48.58 psu, an average temperature of 24.72 ¬∞C and 6.44 mg/L of dissolved oxygen. === Climate === The following is climate data for Al Khor City. ==Sports== One major sports stadium currently exists in the city: Al-Khor SC Stadium, whose tenants are Al Khor SC. Al Bayt Stadium is planned to be completed by the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Al Bayt Stadium, which translates to 'the house', is designed to replicate a traditional tent used by Qatari nomads. The seating capacity will be 60,000 spectators and it is set to host one of the semi-finals. The Italian industrial group Salini Impregilo was contracted to oversee the stadium's construction operations for a fee of QR 3.1 billion. File:Al-Khor SC Stadium2 Qatar.jpgAl Khor SC Stadium, current home grounds of Al Khor SC File:Al Bayt Stadium 02.jpgView of construction of Al Bayt Stadium from the highway ==Health== Al Khor Hospital Training Center The city is currently served by Al Khor General Hospital, which is under the auspices of Hamad Medical Corporation. It has a bed capacity of 115 and was opened in May 2005 as the first multi-specialty healthcare facility situated outside of Doha. Health services provided by the hospital include general medical care, general surgery, obstetrics, pediatrics and neonatal care. There are also a number of health centers, one of the largest being Al Khor Community Medical Centre. Ashghal (Public Works Authority) announced their intent to open a hospital with a bed capacity of 500 at a cost of QR 3.6 billion by 2017. Also included in the plan was a modern health center. ==Education== Harbour In 1952, the city witnessed the opening of the first formal school outside of the capital Doha. The city's first public library was opened in 1977. Al Khor International School is the main school in Al Khor, accommodating 4,000 students of families employed by RasGas and Qatargas. In 2015, a government- sanctioned plan saw the allocation of QR 200 million towards building new schools with a planned completion date of late 2016. ==Residential projects== Families of RasGas and Qatargas were provided with accommodation in Al Khor Community, one of the most sizable residential complexes in the country. However, now only QatarGas employees reside in the community after the acquisition of RasGas by QatarGas. Al Khor International School is located within the community. An investment of over QR 2 billion has been afforded on the complex over the years by Alaqaria, a subsidiary of Barwa Group. ==Visitor attractions== Al Khor Museum Fountain Plaza at Al Khor Park Attractions in Al Khor include Al-Sultan beach hotel & resort, a palace that turned into a hotel, and its large concentrations of modern and historical mosques. The main industry of the city is fishing. There are several beaches surrounding Al Khor, and the beaches south of it are home to many beach houses owned by both residents of the city and residents of Doha. Al Khor Mall is the primary mall in the city, opening its doors in 2012. The city's first cinema was slated to open in Al Khor Mall at the end of 2015. The city has one of the largest parks - Al Khor Park in Qatar with an area of 240,000 sq m. Starting in June 2010, the government has invested QR 250 million in refurbishing the park. This has resulted in the development of new facilities in the park such as a mini-golf course, a railway station and a museum. Renovated Park was opened officially on February 18, 2016. Located in a former two-level police station along the coast in Al Khor City is the Al Khor Archaeological Museum. It houses artifacts collected from expeditions carried out in the municipality. On the ground floor of the museum, handiwork relating to Qatar's cultural heritage are on display, and there are exhibits on the maritime traditions historically engaged in by Qataris, such as fishing and ship-building. Ancient artifacts obtained from excavations, including those done on the dye industry in Al Khor Island, are hosted on the first floor, as well as geographic maps of Al Khor. On the second level, visitors are provided with a view of the bay and docks near the museum. Al Khor Beach Entrance to Al Khor Park ===Natural attractions=== Al Khor Island (commonly known as Purple Island) is located near the city. Considered to be a domestic ecoturism destination, the island is connected to Al Khor by a tapered dirt path which runs through a number of streams. A fenced-off beach known as Al Khor Family Beach provides a recreational space for families. It is situated on the Farkeeh Coast and accommodates bathrooms, a playground and a concession stand. ===Historic sites=== Three historic watchtowers, known as the Al Khor Towers, remain near Al Khor's shoreline, having been built in the late 19th century to early 20th century. Their primary purposes were to provide a vantage point and to scout for potential attacks. The three towers, each cylindrical in shape, have walls that are 60 cm thick and diameters of approximately 4 m each. Comprising two houses adjacent to a marketplace, the Al Ansari Property is situated in the central part of Al Khor. It was constructed around 1930 for members of the Al Ansari family, whom also owned the neighboring Al Khor Souq, which dates back to 1910. The houses underwent several expansions after their construction in order to lodge more family members. ==Culture== A well-known local myth is that of May and Gilan, the alleged progenitors of the sail. According to tradition, in old times, a wealthy man named Ghilan resided in Al Khor. Besides commanding a crew of sailors and fishermen, he owned numerous pearling boats. As time passed, a woman named May who commanded superior number of boats and crewmen emerged as Ghilan's main adversary. In an incident in which both crews were attempting to harvest the same pearl bed, May taunted Ghilan as her ship raced past his. This incensed Ghilan, who set out to discover a way to best his competitor. While observing a grasshopper, Ghilan took note of how its wings worked, and applied the same principle to his boats, giving rise to the sail. This enabled his boats to travel at higher speeds, allowing him to outpace May's boats to the densest pearl beds. The myth is typically presented in five sequences and is unlike most other known Bedouin stories. According to locals of Al Khor, the myth originated from the Al Muhannadi tribe of Al Khor. The story is not well-known elsewhere in Qatar. ==Transport== Air traffic control tower at Al Khor Airport ===Air=== Aviation traffic is controlled by Al Khor Airport. The airport is mostly used by general aviation aircraft and has served as the venue of the annual Al Khor Fly-In since 2008. The fly-in lasts for two days and allows visitors to travel in and spectate aircraft. Aircraft from other GCC countries are showcased at the event. ===Road=== Turkish company Tekfen was contracted to construct the $2.1 billion Al Khor Expressway in August 2016. The expressway is designed to be 34 km in length and will run from Doha Golf Club in Al Egla, a locality of Al Daayen, up to Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor City. A designated bicycle lane and ten interchanges are to be incorporated as part of the project. Commutes between the capital Doha and the municipality of Al Khor are currently facilitated by Al Shamal Road and Al Khor Coastal Road, with the latter road running through Al Daayen and the former running through Umm Salal. Al Khor and Ras Laffan are connected through Al Huwailah Link Road. In November 2014, the 16-km road was ameliorated by increasing it from one lane to four lanes. Qatar's longest highway, Al Majd Road (formerly known as the Orbital Highway), links Al Khor with the south-eastern coastal city of Mesaieed. ===Rail=== As of 2019, the elevated Al Khor Metro Station is under construction, having been launched during Phase 1A. Once completed, it will be part of Doha Metro's Red Line North. ==Administration== When free elections of the Central Municipal Council first took place in Qatar during 1999, Al Khor was designated the seat of constituency no. 26. It would remain the headquarters of constituency no. 26 for the next three consecutive elections until the fifth municipal elections in 2015, when it was made the headquarters of constituency no. 25. Also included in its constituency is Simaisma, Al Daayen Village, north Lusail, and Ras Matbakh. In the inaugural municipal elections in 1999, Rashid Jassim Al-Mohannadi won the elections, receiving 63.3%, or 283 votes. The runner-up candidate was Saleh Majed Al-Mohannadi, whose share of the votes was 12.3%, or 54 votes. Voter turnout was 83.4% Al-Mohannadi retained his seat in the 2002 elections. For the 2007 elections, Saqer Saeed Al-Mohannadi was elected. He once again won the next elections in 2011 to retain his seat. The 2015 elections saw Nasser Ibrahim Al-Mohannadi elected constituent representative. ==Archaeology== Excavation of the Kassite dye site on Al Khor Island At Al Khor Island off the bay, excavations have uncovered four main periods of occupation, dating from as early as c. 2000 BC to as late as 1900 AD. The island is best known for being the site of operation of a Kassite- controlled purple dye industry in the second millennium BC. A cemetery of at least 18 cairns is found approximately west of the city, situated atop a hillock and separated from the city by a sabkha (salt flat). It was uncovered in 1976 by the French Archaeological Mission in Qatar and was dubbed \\"F.P.P.\\" in the team's reports. B√©atrix Midant-Reynes, a member of the team, excavated eight of the burial mounds starting in 1976. The first grave excavated had a length of roughly 2.6 meters, a width of 1.6 meters and was 20 centimeters tall. Two roof slabs that measured 40 by 50 centimeters and 60 by 30 centimeters, respectively, were used as cover for the cairn. Four layers of stone slabs were found in the mound. Underneath the slabs was a sandy pit containing sea snail shells. The second grave excavated by the team was more substantial in size, having a length of 3.5 meters, a width of 3 meters and stood 30 meters tall. Decayed skeletal remains were uncovered in this grave. Similar to the other grave, flat stone slabs were also discovered in this mound, some fitted into the bedrock, however no pit was found. Fifteen sea snails were discovered inside this cairn. More substantial finds would be recovered from the remaining six excavations. The team concluded that some graves were reserved for individuals while others were apparently family burials. Artifacts uncovered included shell beads, obsidian beads and carnelian beads. The cairns are of indeterminable age but are thought to date from some time in the Neolithic period. ==Demographics== Residential neighbourhood The following table shows the population of Al Khor. {  + Al Khor Population - !

The book covers the history of the India after it gained independence from the British in 1947. A revised and expanded edition was published in 2017/18. ==Background== In November 1997, Peter Straus, then head of Picador, met Ramchandra Guha and suggested that he write a history of independent India. Straus had read an article by Guha in the Oxford journal Past and Present. He suggested that since Indian historians typically stopped their narratives with Indian independence in 1947, a scholarly analysis of modern Indian history post-independence would be of interest. Guha signed a contract in March 1998, with a delivery date for the book specified for March 2002. In writing the book, Guha consulted the private papers of several important Indian personalities, as well as newspaper records, housed at the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, New Delhi. The private papers of Indian independence activist and politician C Rajagopalachari and P N Haksar, Indira Gandhi's principal secretary 1967 and 1973, were especially useful to Guha's research. Guha sent across his final draft to Straus in 2006, and the book was published in 2007. === Expanded edition === Guha re-organized Part Five chronologically (in the earlier edition this section followed a thematic approach), added two chapters based entirely on new material (Progress and its Discontents & The Rise of the BJP Systems), and rewritten the epilogue (A 50‚Äì50 Democracy) for the 10th anniversay edition. == Contents == * Prologue: Unnatural Nation * Part One: Picking up the Pieces Freedom and Parricide‚ÄîThe Logic of Division‚ÄîApples in the Basket‚ÄîA Valley Bloody and Beautiful‚ÄîRefugees and the Republic‚ÄîIdeas of India * Part Two: Nehru‚Äôs India The Biggest Gamble in History‚ÄîHome and the World‚ÄîRedrawing the Map‚ÄîThe Conquest of Nature‚ÄîThe Law and the Prophets‚ÄîSecuring Kashmir‚ÄîTribal Trouble * Part Three: Shaking the Centre The Southern Challenge‚ÄîThe Experience of Defeat‚ÄîPeace in Our Time‚ÄîMinding the Minorities * Part Four: The Rise of Populism War and Succession‚ÄîLeftward Turns‚ÄîThe Elixir of Victory‚ÄîThe Rivals‚ÄîAutumn of the Matriarch‚ÄîLife Without the Congress‚ÄîDemocracy in Disarray‚ÄîThis Son also Rises * Part Five: A History of Events Rights and Riots‚ÄîA Multi-polar Polity‚ÄîRulers and Riches‚ÄîProgress and its Discontents‚ÄîThe Rise of the BJP Systems * Epilogue: A 50‚Äì50 Democracy == Publication history == * First edition - 2007/2008 * 10th anniversay edition (2016/2017) - revised, expanded and updated (first updated edition) === Translations === India After Gandhi was translated into Hindi as Bharat Gandhi Ke Baad by India Today journalist Sushant Jha, an alumnus of the Indian Institute of Mass Communication, New Delhi. == Reception == India after Gandhi was chosen Book of the Year by The Economist, The Wall Street Journal and Outlook Magazine, among others.

Behind the spring lies the Huayang Palace. Hua Hill (Shandong) () is a solitary cone-shaped hill in the lower Yellow River valley, located at the northeastern edge of the city of Jinan, Shandong Province, China. The hill is known for its cultural and historical significance as well as for its natural environment. It has been an inspiration for Chinese artists for many centuries and was the site of the Battle of An, a major battle fought during the Spring and Autumn period. ==Name== The name Hu√† ShƒÅn is sometimes spoken as Hu√° ShƒÅn and can be translated literally as \\"Flowery Hill\\" or \\"Splendid Hill\\". The first character of the name () has long been used as a literary rather than political synonym for China itself. The second character of the name () is used for mountains and hills, irrespective of their size. The name Hu√† ShƒÅn () as well as the near homophone HuƒÅ ShƒÅn (Ëä±Â±±, literally \\"Flower Mountain\\") are both common names in Chinese geography. In particular, Hua Hill is not to be confused with Mount Hua in Shaanxi Province. Hua Hill is also known as Hua Fu Zhu Hill (). ==Hill== Hua Hill is one of the \\"Nine Solitary Hills\\" () in the Yellow River valley within and to the north of Jinan City; the other eight hills are (names used during the Qing Dynasty): Woniu Hill (), Que Hill (, literally \\"Magpie Hill\\", located about 2.5 kilometers north of the Hua Hill on the other side of the Yellow River), Biao Hill (, meaning \\"Landmark Hill\\"), Fenghuang Hill (, Fenghuang is the \\"Chinese Phoenix\\"), Northern Maan Hill (, meaning \\"Northern Horseshoe Hill\\"), Su Hill (, literally \\"Grain Hill\\"), Kuang Hill (, literally \\"Basket Hill\\"), and Yao Hill (, literally \\"Medicine Hill\\"). The hill has an elevation of 197 meters above sea level; its slopes are covered with large smooth rocks and bushy vegetation growing in the clefts between them. The foot of the hill is flanked by small villages on the eastern and western side. To the east and south, the hill is also surrounded by a crescent-shaped row of ponds. A flight of stone stairs has been laid up the southern flank of the hill to the summit. In the times before the Northern Song Dynasty, Hua Hill was surrounded by a lake known as the \\"Magpie Hill Lake\\" (), named for the nearby Magpie Hill. Since Hua Hill appeared to float on the waters of the lake like the bud of a lotus flower to contemporary observers, it was given its alternative name \\"Hua Fu Zhu Shan\\" (\\"Flower Bud in the Water Hill\\"). ==Historical significance== In the year 589 BC, during the Spring and Autumn period, Hua Hill became the site of the final action in the Battle of An which was fought between the states of Qi and Jin. During the preparation for the battle, the Qi army used the Northern Maan Hill (about 4 kilometers southwest of Hua Hill) as a staging area. The Jin army had its positions right at Hua Hill. The Qi army started the battle by attacking the Jin positions on Hua Hill, but the battle ended in a victory for the State of Jin. Eventually an alliance was formed between the two states. During part of the 20th century, a small fortified army base was located at the hill. Although the base has been abandoned, some fortifications in the form of bunkers and tunnels at the foot of the hill remain. ==Cultural significance== God of the Four Seasons in Huayang Palace The natural environment of Hua Hill has inspired the works of a number of writers and painters. During the period of the Northern Wei Dynasty, the writer and geographer Li Daoyuan, described Hua Hill in his \\"Commentary on the Waterways Classic\\" (): \\"Without a mountain range to support it, the peak alone stands gracefully and loftily. Its verdant cliff rises into the blue, tinting the moon with its green.\\" (). The Tang- Dynasty poet Li Bai wrote about Hua Hill: {  , . , . In ancient times I traveled to the Capital of Qi, climbed the Huabuzhu peak. This mountain is delicately beautiful, the emerald-green [hill] is pure like a lotus leaf. } The best known pictorial depiction of Hua Hill is a painting from the Yuan- Dynasty era entitled \\"Autumn Colors at Que and Hua Hills\\" () by the painter and calligrapher Zhao Mengfu (now in the collection of the National Palace Museum in Taipeh). In the text accompanying his painting, Zhao Mengfu revers to Hua Hill as \\"the most famous mountain in the area, having been known from antiquity and unique for its sharp peak\\".Description of the painting \\"Autumn Colors at Que and Hua Hills Various rock faces on the mountain slope have been adorned with calligraphic inscriptions. ==Temples== Courtyard in the Huayang Palace The Huayang Palace (, literally \\"Glorious Sun Palace\\") is a primarily Taoist temple located at the southern foot of the hill on gently sloping terrain. Its founding during the Jin dynasty (in the year 1220) is attributed to Chen Zhiyuan, a disciple of the Quanzhen Taoist Qiu Chuji, who in turn was the foremost disciple of Wang Chongyang, the founder of Quanzhen Taoism. The original purpose of the building was to serve as a Taoist temple dedicated to the \\"Five Color Gods\\" () representing east (, green), west (, white), north (, black), south (, red), and center (, yellow). Over time, the temple has also come to include sites of worship for Buddhism and Confucianism. In 1532, during the Ming Dynasty, the palace complex was renamed into Chong Zheng Temple (, literally \\"Admiration of the Righteousness Temple\\"). The central hall of the complex was dedicated to two persons worshipped at the time, Feng Chou Fu and Min Ziqian (Style name of Min Sun, one of the disciples of Confucius). The two side halls were dedicated to groups of 19 and 22 people famous in the period, respectively. Later in the Ming Dynasty, the name of the complex was changed back to Huayang Palace and dedicated to the God of the Four Seasons (). During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, temples dedicated to the god Bi Xia (, the god of Mount Tai) and the three gods of heaven, earth, and water () were added. Part of the Huayang Palace is the Taishan Resting Palace (), it was used by the emperor as a resting place on his way to Mount Tai. The grounds of Huayang Palace cover a rectangular area of approximately 3 hectares, which is completely enclosed by a stone-and-brick wall. Between the temple buildings stand old pine trees (some around 900 years old) as well as stone stelas. Graffiti from the Cultural Revolution In the 20th century, the Huayang Palace was used as a military storage facility for about 50 years. It was reopened to the public in 1990\\\\. The books kept in the palace were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. Some wall paintings in the temple buildings were also plastered over and covered with slogans of the Cultural Revolution during this time. The present-day entrance to the complex is the gate to the inner courtyard of the palace; the outer courtyard has not been preserved. The gate currently standing dates back to the Ming and Qing Dynasties; there is no record about the previous gates which are likely to have previously occupied its place. The gate building houses the statues of the \\"Four Zhi Gong Cao\\" (), four minor deities (Year Zhi, Month Zhi, Day Zhi, and Hour Zhi) that are thought to be positioned on the border between heaven and earth in order to fulfill book- and gate keeping duties. Further up on the slope of the mountain lies the smaller Daoist L√º Dongbin Temple (), dedicated to L√º Dongbin, one of the Eight Immortals. ==Hua Spring== A spring, the Hua Spring (), is located at the southern foot of the hill in front of the entrance to the Huayang Palace. The Hua Spring mentioned in the traditions about the events at the Battle of An: The King of Qi is said to have used the pretense of fetching water from the Hua Spring as an excuse for fleeing the battle field in the face of imminent defeat. Over time, the spring has fallen dry various times. Its most recent revival was undertaken during a renovation in the year 2000. During this work, a pool with an area of 17.6 meters times 10 meters and depth of 3.5 meters was excavated, bringing the outflow from the spring up to a maximum of 40 cubic meters per hour (during the rainy season). ==Protection and development== Huayang Palace became a Jinan City Heritage site on September 3, 1979. The Huashan landscape area intended to protect its surroundings was opened on October 1, 2000. ==See also== *List of sites in Jinan ==References== *\\"Huashan Mountain\\" *Battle of An *\\"Scenic Spots in Shandong Province\\" *Article about Tree Planting Plans on Yellow River embankment Category:Landforms of Shandong Category:Hills of China Category:Bodies of water of Shandong Category:Springs of China ","title":"Hua Hill"},{"id":"19309043","text":"Enorme is the sixth album by Mexican singer Alejandra Guzm√°n.

Al Khor City, the municipal seat, is located in the northeast coast of Qatar, around from the capital, Doha and it is considered to be one of the major cities in Qatar. Al Thakhira is the second largest settlement in the municipality after Al Khor City. The region was ruled by the Al Muhannadi tribe, which consists of seven Bedouin families, before Qatar gained its independence in 1971. Tourism has been increasing in recent years owing to the municipality's various resorts, natural areas and cultural attractions. Fishing was the historical mainstay of most the municipality's inhabitants. ==Etymology== Al Khor Municipality derives its name from the city of the same name. In Arabic, Al Khawr means bay; it was so named because Al Khor City was near a bay. Formerly, the city was known as \\"Khor Al-Shaqiq\\". ==History== Al Khor Municipality was established in July 1972, alongside Qatar's four other initial municipalities, and supervises the city of Al Khor in addition to other settlements in the municipality. As of 2017, Ibrahim Issa Nasser Al Fadalah is the mayor of the municipality. ==Municipal seat== Al Khor City, the municipal seat, is a coastal city located north of the capital Doha, 47 km away from Madinat ash Shamal, and 44 km away from Al Wakrah. In the past, it was well known for the role it played in Qatar's bustling pearling industry, as well as for its harbour which is filled with fishing boats and small crafts. Several beaches, renovated forts and cultural attractions are found in the city. ==Geography== Beach in Al Thakhira Al Khor is situated in northern Qatar, bordered by the municipalities of Al Shamal to the north, Al Daayen and Umm Salal to the southeast, and Al-Shahaniya to the southwest. In addition to the main municipal headquarters in Al Khor City, there are Ministry of Municipality and Environment branches in Al Thakhira and Al Ghuwariyah. Much of Al Khor's territory lies along the Qatari Peninsula's eastern coast, including the eastern boundaries of municipality's two main cities ‚Äì Al Khor City and Al Thakhira. Numerous beaches are located in this area, including Al- Farka Beach in Al Khor City and Al Thakhira Beach. A seafront promenade stretched over a 28,000 square meter area known as Al Khor Corniche runs through the municipal seat. Mangroves (Avicennia marina) in Al Khor Island overlooking the mainland According to the Ministry of Municipality and Environment, the municipality accommodates 170 rawdas, 49 wadis, 57 jeris (places where water flows), seven jeryan (multiple jeris), seven plains, 22 hills, five highlands, 13 sabkhas, 17 capes, four bays, and three coral reefs. Four islands are found off its shores, the most important of which is Al Khor Island (also known as Jazirat Bin Ghanim). White mangrove forests in Qatar can be found in greatest abundance near Al Khor and Al Thakhira. This species of mangroves is well-adapted to the saline conditions of the northeast coast. A minimum of eight mangrove sites exist in Qatar, and all are protected areas as of a 2006 Emiri decree. === Climate === The following is climate data for the municipal seat, Al Khor. ==Administration== The municipality is divided into 3 zones which are then divided into 454 blocks. Two of its main districts, Simaisma and Al Jeryan, are geographically located in Al Daayen. Additionally, the village of Madinat Al Kaaban is geographically located in Al Khor but serves as an administrative district for Al Shamal. ===Administrative zones=== The following administrative zones are found in Al Khor Municipality : {  - !

The north-east portion of the municipality, known as Ras Laffan, was converted to a natural gas processing center. At present, Ras Laffan accommodates the world's largest GTL plant, the Pearl GTL which was constructed as by a partnership between Royal Dutch Shell and Qatar Petroleum. Qatar is also the world's second largest supplier of helium, which can bextracted from natural gas. All of the country's helium is produced by RasGas's two helium plants in Ras Laffan, which were commissioned in 2005 and 2013, respectively. In June 2017, amidst the Qatar diplomatic crisis, the government ordered the two plants to be shut down indefinitely. ===Agriculture=== Agricultural activities such as fishing and pearling were traditional mainstays of the inhabitants of this region. Despite being overtaken in importance by the extraction and construction industries, agriculture is still one of the largest industries in Al Khor. Domestically, 35% of Qatar's total farmland was based in Al Khor in 2015, putting it just behind the municipality of Al Rayyan which had a 36% share of Qatar's farmland. Al Khor, however, had the highest density of farms. There were 344 farms spread out over 16,943 hectares, most of which (220) were mixed operations, 119 of which were occupied solely by crops, and 3 of which livestock were reared on. The municipality had a livestock inventory of 160,675, the majority of which were sheep (109,337). Livestock numbers surpassed that of all other municipalities. Root vegetables such as carrots, potatoes, onions and fodder beets are some of the most important crops produced by Qatari farms, the latter of which is grown in large quantities at Al Dawoodiyah in Al Khor. Fishing vessels in Al Khor City In terms of artisanal fishing vessels, Al Khor had the highest amount out of any city surveyed in 2015 at 234 vessels. The city also had the most sailors (1,408) and was also the only major city to record an increase in the rate of sailors from 2010 to 2015. After Qatar was embargoed by a quartet composed of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt in June 2017, it launched a project to fly over 10,000 cows to Qatar in order to reach its goal of food self-sufficiency. This project will be based on a two-million square meter plot owned by Baladna in the Umm Al Hawaya locality of the municipality. One of the most important agricultural research stations in Qatar is located in Rawdat Al Faras. The research station, established in 1976, consists of a laboratory, a warehouse and five palm tree fields hosting thousands of palm trees. Capitalizing on the municipality's rich maritime tradition, the 101,000 square meter facility of the Aquatic Fisheries and Research Centre was completed in Ras Matbakh by Ashghal in 2017 at a cost of QR 237.7 million. Three major government-owned plant nurseries are located in Al Khor; two are in the village of Al Rashida, and there is one in Rawdat Bakheela. Plants grown in these nurseries are used for research and also distributed to government ministries. The nurseries in Al Rashida each span 2,500 square meters and were established in 2003. A farmers' market is found in Al Khor Yard. ==Housing== Al Khor's municipal council announced plans to open two workers' cities in the Abu Al Qararis area in 2016. These cities are planned to facilitate 45,000 inhabitants. Neighborhood in Al Khor City Barwa Group carries out real estate projects in Al Khor through its subsidiary, Barwa Al Khor. In November 2008, the group unveiled its major 'Urjuan' project, which had a projected cost of $10 billion. Located near the city of Al Khor, Urjuan was described as a planned city capable of hosting 63,000 inhabitants spread over 5.5 million square km. The project had a planned completion date of 2013 and its plots were to be sold through several phases. However, in December 2009, the project was indefinitely put on hold. Shell Project, a real estate project featuring 350 housing units, a supermarket, and a mosque spanning an area of 138,000 square meters, was completed by Barwa Al Khor in 2016 and its ownership transferred to Royal Dutch Shell. Al Khor Community constitutes the biggest housing community in the country at about 15,000 residents. Located in Umm Enaig near Al Thakhira, it hosts 15,000 people and has well-developed infrastructure, including a medical center, five sports facilities, a library, schools, a skate park and playgrounds. ==Transport== Al Thakhira Road in Al Khor City Air traffic control tower at Al Khor Airport ===Roads=== Turkish company Tekfen was contracted to construct the $2.1 billion Al Khor Expressway in August 2016. The expressway is designed to be in length and will run from Doha Golf Club in Al Egla, a locality of Al Daayen, up to Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor City. A designated bicycle lane and ten interchanges are to be incorporated as part of the project. Commutes between the capital Doha and the municipality of Al Khor are currently facilitated by Al Shamal Road and Al Khor Coastal Road, with the latter road running through Al Daayen and the former running through Umm Salal. ===Air=== Aviation traffic is controlled by Al Khor Airport in Al Khor City. The airport is mostly used by general aviation aircraft and has served as the venue of the annual Al Khor Fly-In since 2008. The fly-in lasts for two days and allows visitors to travel in and spectate aircraft. Aircraft from other GCC countries are showcased at the event. ===Rail=== The Doha Metro's Red Line (also known as Coast Line) will extend to Al Khor.

Al Bayt Stadium, also in Al Khor City, is planned to be completed by the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Al Bayt Stadium, which translates to 'the house', is designed to replicate a traditional tent used by Qatari nomads. The seating capacity will be 60,000 spectators and it is set to host one of the semi-finals. Al Thakhira has its own amateur football league. In 2005, Al Thakhira FC was formed and has competed in the QFA-sanctioned Qatar Amateur League since 2013. Barwa Al Khor formally opened Al Khor Workers Sports Complex in the Al Khor Industrial Area in February 2014. Intended to serve the entire municipality of Al Khor as well as portions of Al Shamal Municipality, the sporting facilities within this massive complex include four cricket fields, four football fields, four basketball courts and three volleyball courts. In addition, there are 35 shops, 2 cinemas and a mosque among its facilities. In 2015, over 500,000 people had visited the complex. ==Visitor attractions== Entrance to Al Khor Park According to the Ministry of Municipality and Environment, the municipality hosts 7 parks as of 2018. Al Khor City has the largest park in the municipality - Al Khor Park with an area of 240,000 square meters. Starting in June 2010, the government has invested QR 250 million in refurbishing the park. This has resulted in the development of new facilities in the park such as a mini-golf course, a railway station and a museum. Al Thakhira also has a major park, opened in 2009 and covering an area of 14,580 square meters. Al Ghuwariyah opened its own park in 2017 over an area of 9,234 square meters. Landscape of Al Khor Island Al Khor Island (commonly known as Purple Island) is located near Al Khor City. Considered to be a domestic ecoturism destination, the island is connected to the mainland by a tapered dirt path which runs through a number of streams. Aside from its scenic landscape, the island is also known for its historical role in the Kassite dyeing industry dating back several thousand years. ==Demographics== The following table is a breakdown of registered live births by nationality and sex for Al Khor.

Educated at various primary schools determined by his father's postings, he won a scholarship to Wesley College and then to Queen's College. He completed his Leaving Certificate at Wesley in 1903 and played for the first XI (cricket) and first XVIII (football). He entered the University of Melbourne in 1905 and earned exhibitions in pathology, medicine and obstetrics (M.B., 1909; B.S., 1910; M.D., 1912; M.S., 1913). While at University, he played VFL football for the team. He performed well in his debut against and played every game until the end of the 1911 VFL season. ==Early medical career== After graduating as a doctor, Hurley was appointed resident medical officer at the Royal Melbourne Hospital and in 1911 he became a registrar. The next year he was appointed medical superintendent, and during his time in the role there was an almost total rebuilding of the hospital on its Lonsdale Street site. He was appointed an honorary surgeon to out-patients in 1914 and commenced private practice in Collins Street. ==First World War== On 20 August 1914, Hurley was appointed a captain in the Australian Army Medical Corps, Australian Imperial Force (AIF), and sailed for Egypt in October. He served at Gallipoli from April to September 1915 with the 2nd Field Ambulance. Promoted to lieutenant colonel in March 1916, he performed staff duties at AIF Headquarters (London) in 1916‚Äì17 and mentioned in despatches for his \\"tact, ability and strenuous work\\". In 1917‚Äì18 he served at the Western Front, primarily with the 2nd Australian General Hospital. Hurley was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1917 for his services to the AIF ‚Äì Australian Army Medical Corps. ==Medical career resumes== After completing his service with the AIF, Hurley completed his Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons (FRCS) before returning to Melbourne in 1920. He resumed work as an outpatient surgeon at the Royal Melbourne Hospital and in private practice. Hurley rapidly regained prominence in Melbourne medical circles, being appointed a lecturer and examiner in surgery at the University of Melbourne, founding secretary (1920‚Äì23) of the Surgical Association of Melbourne and assistant to George Syme, surgeon to the Victoria Police. After Syme's retirement in 1928, Hurley was appointed to that position and held it until 1956. In 1921 he was elected to the council of the Victorian branch of the British Medical Association (president 1930), and he served on the council for the rest of his life, apart from a short interval during the Second World War. He was a long-serving member (1923‚Äì48) of the Charities Board of Victoria and a foundation member of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. In 1927 he was made honorary surgeon to in-patients at the Royal Melbourne Hospital and was dean of its clinical school from 1929‚Äì36. ==Second World War== During the Second World War, Hurley served as Director of Medical Services for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), being awarded the rank of air vice marshal. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1945. Hurley was subsequently knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1950 for his public services. ==Personal life== In June 1919 at St James, Westminster, Victor Hurley married Elsie May Crowther, a fellow Australian serving as a member of the Voluntary Aid Detachment in London and they had two daughters and four sons together. They lived in various homes in South Yarra, Toorak and Kew and often holidayed at their family seaside cottage at Point Lonsdale. Hurley had a natural charm, equable, quiet cheerfulness, humanity, tolerance and easy sociability that made him approachable to colleagues and patients alike. He was president of the Naval and Military Club, a member of the Melbourne Club, and was a keen golfer at the Royal Melbourne Golf Club. Survived by his wife and children, Sir Victor Hurley died of complications of emphysema on 17 July 1958 at Royal Melbourne Hospital. ==References * *Australian Dictionary of Biography ‚Äì Sir Thomas Ernest Victor Hurley Category:1888 births Category:1958 deaths Category:Australian Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:Australian Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:Australian Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire Category:Australian military personnel of World War I Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Australian surgeons Category:Melbourne Medical School alumni Category:People educated at Wesley College (Victoria) Category:Royal Australian Air Force air marshals of World War II Category:University Football Club players ","title":"Victor Hurley"},{"id":"19309127","text":"Dragline is the debut studio album by the American grunge band Paw.

Feist spent much of her early career collaborating with various bands and artists, such as By Divine Right who she toured with for three years. In 1999 she released her first solo album, Monarch (Lay Your Jewelled Head Down), though the record didn't receive the attention of her later works. 2001 saw her work with Kevin Drew and Brendan Canning on Feel Good Lost, the first album by Broken Social Scene. Feist would go on to appear on every one of the band's albums and toured intermittently with them up until 2005. Her second solo album, Let It Die brought Feist to an international audience, charting in multiple countries whilst garnering three nominations at the 2005 Juno Awards with wins for Best Alternative Album and Best New Artist. The record has since gone platinum in Canada. In 2006, she released Open Season, a remix album of Let It Die featuring collaborations with various artists. Her fourth album, The Reminder which was released in 2007, proved to be her most successful yet. The album charted at number 16 on the Billboard 200 and would go on to win the Shortlist Music Prize.

Co. v. Dunmeyer, 113 U.S. 629 (1885), was a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Kansas. The action was brought in that court on a covenant of warranty of title to two pieces of land in a deed of conveyance made by the Kansas Pacific Railroad Company to Dunmeyer.Kansas Pacific R. Co. v. Dunmeyer, . The Pacific Railroad Acts generally allowed railroads to sell public land adjacent to their routes as part of a land grant to raise funds but made an exception for land that already had a homestead filed. G. B. Dunmeyer claimed he purchased land that already had an existing claim. ==Background== The suit was brought for breach of covenant of warranty of title to a tract of land in Kansas. Plaintiff in error was defendant below. Its title was derived from grants of public land to aid in the construction of a railway to the Pacific. The tract was within the location of the railroad grants, but was excepted from those grants by reason of a homestead entry and possession. Subsequent to this entry and possession, the party so in possession took title from the railroad company, and the homestead entry was cancelled. The alleged paramount adverse title was derived from a patent from the United States issued on a homestead entry made subsequent to these proceedings. The Supreme Court of Kansas found that there was a breach of the warranty, and rendered judgment accordingly. This writ of error was brought to review that judgment. The land was sold by the company to George W. Miller, to whom a certificate of sale was given, which afterwards was assigned to Lewis Dunmeyer, to whom the company made a deed purporting to convey a good title. On this covenant for good title Dunmeyer brought the present action, alleging that the railroad company never had any title, and that the covenant was therefore broken. On this issue the case was tried. Several other defenses were set up, among them that the covenant was not broken, because Dunmeyer was in possession when he bought the certificate issued to Miller and when he took his deed, and has never been disturbed or ousted; that Miller was in possession when he bought of the company and transferred possession to Dunmeyer, and that this has been held ever since, and that Miller's purchase was a compromise of disputed rights, and he and Dunmeyer are therefore estopped to maintain this action. But these and perhaps other points, decided against plaintiff in error, do not present questions of federal law which this Court can review in a judgment of a state court. The record shows that on July 25, 1866, Miller made a homestead entry on this land which was in every respect valid if the land was then public land subject to such entry. It also shows that the line of definite location of the company's road was first filed with the Commissioner of the General Land Office at Washington, September 21, 1866. This entry of Miller's therefore brought the land within the language of the exception in the grant as land to which a homestead claim had attached at the time the line of said road was definitely fixed. For we are of opinion that under this grant, as under many other grants containing the same words or words to the same purport, the act which fixes the time of definite location is the act of filing the map or plat of this line in the office of the commissioner of the General Land Office. ==Decision== Of two arguments made, the stronger is in regards that while the company did not file its line of definite location until about two months after Miller made his homestead entry, it did designate the general route of said road, and file a map thereof in the General Land Office July 11 of the same year, 1866, which was fifteen days before Miller's homestead entry. This latter map was filed in the office of the register and receiver on 26 July, one day after Miller made his entry. It is argued that until this was done, Miller's right of entry remained unaffected. But the court was of opinion that the duty of filing this map, as required by the act, like that of the line of definite location, is performed by filing it in the General Land Office, which is filing it with the Secretary of the Interior, and that whatever rights accrue to the company from the act of filing it accrue from filing it there. In this case before the high court, a claim was made and filed in the land office, and there recognized, before the line of the company's road was located. That claim was an existing one of public record in favor of Miller when the map of plaintiff in error was filed. In the language of the act of Congress, this homestead claim had attached to the land, and it therefore did not pass by the grant. Of all the words in the English language, this word \\"attached' was probably the best that could have been used. It did not mean mere settlement, residence, or cultivation of the land, but it meant a proceeding in the proper land office, by which the inchoate right to the land was initiated. It meant that by such a proceeding, a right of homestead had fastened to that land which could ripen into a perfect title by future residence and cultivation. With the performance of these conditions the company had nothing to do. The right of the homestead having attached to the land, it was excepted out of the grant as much as if, in a deed, it had been excluded from the conveyance by metes and bounds. The difference in the two cases is obvious. The judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Kansas was affirmed. ==See also== *Union Pacific R. Co. v.

During this process, the DNA polymerase ‚Äúreads‚Äù existing DNA strands and creates two new strands that match the existing ones. The T7 DNA polymerase requires a host factor, E. coli thioredoxin, in order to carry out its function. This helps stabilize the binding of the necessary protein to the primer-template to improve processivity by more than 100-fold, which is a feature unique to this enzyme. It is a member of the Family A DNA polymerases, which include E. coli DNA polymerase I and Taq DNA polymerase. This polymerase has various applications in site-directed mutagenesis as well as a high- fidelity enzyme suitable for PCR. It has also served as the precursor to Sequenase, an engineered-enzyme optimized for DNA sequencing. ==MechanismPhosphoryl transfer=== 550px Figure 2. Nucleotidyl transfer by DNA polymerase. T7 DNA polymerase catalyzes the phosphoryl transfer during DNA replication of the T7 phage. As shown in Figure 2, the 3‚Äô hydroxyl group of a primer acts as a nucleophile and attacks the phosphodiester bond of nucleoside 5‚Äô-triphosphate (dTMP-PP). This reaction adds a nucleoside monophosphate into DNA and releases a pyrophosphate (PPi). Generally, the reaction is metal- dependent and cations such as Mg2+ are often present in the enzyme active site. For T7 DNA polymerase, the fingers, palm and thumb (Figure 1) position the primer-template so that the 3‚Äô-end of the primer strand is positioned next to the nucleotide-binding site (located at the intersection of the fingers and thumb). The base pair formed between the nucleotide and the template base fits nicely into a groove between the fingers and the 3‚Äô-end of the primer. Two Mg2+ ions form an octahedral coordinate network with oxygen ligand and also bring the reactive primer hydroxyl and the nucleotide Œ±-phosphate close together, thereby lowering the entropic cost of nucleophilic addition. The rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle occurs after the nucleoside triphosphate binds and before it is incorporated into the DNA (corresponding to the closure of the fingers subdomain around the DNA and nucleotide). 600px ===Role of Mg2+ ions and amino acid residues in the active site=== The amino acids present in the active site assist in creating a stabilizing environment for the reaction to proceed. Amino acids such as Lys522, Tyr526, His506 and Arg518 act as hydrogen bond donors. The backbone carbonyl of Ala476, Asp475 and Asp654 form coordinate bonds with the Mg2+ ions. Asp475 and Asp654 form a bridge with the Mg2+ cations to orient them properly. The Mg2+ ion on the right (Figure 3) interacts with negatively charged oxygens of the alpha(Œ±), beta(Œ≤) and gamma(Œ≥) phosphates to align the scissile bond for the primer to attack. Even if there is no general base within the active site to deprotonate the primer hydroxyl, the lowered pka of the metal-bound hydroxyl favors the formation of the 3‚Äô-hydroxide nucleophile. Metal ions and Lys522 contact non- bridging oxygens on the Œ±-phosphate to stabilize the negative charge developing on the Œ±-phosphorus during bond formation with the nucleophile. Moreover, the Lys522 sidechain also moves to neutralize the negatively charged pyrophosphate group. Tyr526, His506, Arg518 side chains and the oxygen from the backbone carbonyl group of Ala476 take part in the hydrogen bond network and assist in aligning the substrate for phosphoryl transfer. ==Accessory proteins== leading stand and lagging strand. gp2.5 coats the single-stranded DNA produced during replication. Interactions between T7 polymerase/thioredoxin and accessory proteins contributes to higher processivity in replisome assembly compared to gp5.400px While phage T7 mediates DNA replication in very similar manner to higher organisms, T7 system is generally simpler compared to other replication systems. In addition to T7 DNA polymerase (also known as gp5), T7 replisome requires only four accessory proteins for proper function: host thioredoxin, gp4, gp2.5, and gp1.7. === Host thioredoxin === T7 polymerase by itself has a very low processivity. It dissociates from the primer-template after incorporating about 15 nucleotides. Upon infection of the host, T7 polymerase binds to host thioredoxin in 1:1 ratio. The hydrophobic interaction between thioredoxin and T7 polymerase helps to stabilize the binding of T7 polymerase to primer-template. In addition, the binding of thioredoxin increases T7 polymerase processivity to nearly 80-fold. The precise mechanism for how the thioredoxin-T7 polymerase complex is able to achieve such increase in processivity is still unknown. Binding of thioredoxin exposes a large number of basic amino acid residues in the thumb region of T7 polymerase. Several studies suggest that the electrostatic interaction between these positively charged basic residues with the negatively charged phosphate backbone of DNA and other accessory proteins is responsible for increased processivity in gp5/thioredoxin complex. === gp4 === gp4 is a hexameric protein containing two functional domains: helicase domain and primase domain. The helicase domain unwinds double-stranded DNA to provide template for replication. The C-terminal tail of helicase domain contains several negatively charged acidic residues which make contact with the exposed basic residue of T7 polymerase/thioredoxin. These interactions help to load T7 polymerase/thioredoxin complex onto replication fork. The primase domain catalyzes the synthesis of short oligoribonucleotides. These oligoribonucleotides, called primers, are complementary to the template strand and used to initiate DNA replication. In T7 system, primase domain of one subunit interacts with primase domain of adjacent subunit. This interaction between primase domains acts as a brake to stop helicase when needed, which ensure the leading stand synthesis in-pace with lagging stand synthesis. === gp2.5 === gp2.5 has similar function to single-stranded DNA binding protein. gp2.5 protects single-stranded DNA produced during replication and coordinates synthesis of leading and lagging strands through interaction between its acidic C-terminal tail and gp5/thioredoxin. ===gp1.7=== gp1.7 is a nucleoside monophosphate kinase, which catalyzes the conversion of deoxynucleoside 5'-monophosphates to di and triphosphate nucleotides, which accounts for the sensitivity of T7 polymerase to dideoxynucleotides (see Sequenase below). ==PropertiesProcessivity=== The primary gp5 subunit of T7 DNA Polymerase by itself has low processivity and dissociates from DNA after the incorporation of just a few nucleotides. In order to become efficiently processive, T7 DNA polymerase recruits host thioredoxin to form a thioredoxin- gp5 complex. Thioredoxin binds the thioredoxin binding domain of gp5 thereby stabilizes a flexible DNA binding region of gp5. The stabilization of this region of gp5 alosterically increases the amount of protein surface interaction with the duplex portion of the primer-template. The resulting thioredoxin-gp5 complex increases the affinity of T7 polymerase for the primer terminus by ~80-fold and acts processively around 800 nucleotide incorporation steps. The mechanism adopted by T7 polymerase to achieve its processivity differs from many other polymerases in that it does not rely on a DNA clamp or a clamp loader. Instead, the T7 DNA polymerase complex requires only three proteins for processive DNA polymerization: T7 polymerase (gp5), Escherichia coli thioredoxin, and single-stranded DNA-binding protein gp2.5. Although these three proteins are the only ones required for template single-stranded DNA polymerization, in a native biological setting the thioredoxin-gp5 interacts with gp4 helicase, which provides single-stranded DNA template (figure 4). During leading strand synthesis thioredoxin-gp5 and gp4 form a high affinity complex increasing overall polymerase processivity to around 5 kb. ===Exonuclease activity=== T7 DNA polymerase possesses a 3‚Äô-5‚Äô single and double stranded DNA exonuclease activity. This exonuclease activity is activated when a newly synthesized base does not correctly base-pair with the template strand. Excision of incorrectly incorporated bases acts as a proofreading mechanism thereby increasing the fidelity of T7 polymerase. During early characterization of exonuclease activity, it was discovered that iron-catalyzed oxidation of T7 polymerase produced a modified enzyme with greatly reduced exonuclease activity. This discovery lead to the development and use of T7 Polymerase as a sequenase in early DNA sequencing methods. The mechanism by which T7 DNA polymerase senses that a mismatched base has been incorporated is still a topic of study. However, some studies have provided evidence to suggesting that changes in tension of the template DNA strand caused by base-pair mismatch may induce exonuclease activation. Wuite et al. observed that applying tension of above 40 pN to the template DNA resulted in 100-fold increase in exonuclease activity. ==Applications Strand extensions in site directed mutagenesis === Site-directed mutagenesis is a molecular biology method that is used to make specific and intentional changes to the DNA sequence of a gene and any gene products. The technique was developed at a time when the highest quality commercially available DNA polymerase for converting an oligonucleotide into a complete complementary DNA strand was the large (Klenow) fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase 1. However, ligation step can become an issue with oligonucleotide mutagenesis. That is when the DNA ligase operates inefficiently relative to the DNA polymerase, strand displacement of the oligonucleotide can reduce the mutant frequency. In the other hand, T7 DNA polymerase does not perform strand displacement synthesis; and thus, can be utilized to obtain high mutant frequencies for point mutants independent of ligation. ===Second strand synthesis of cDNA=== cDNA cloning is a major technology for analysis of the expression of genomes. The full-length first-strand can be synthesized through the commercially available reverse transcriptases. Synthesis of the second-strand was once a major limitation to cDNA cloning. Two groups of methods differing by the mechanism of initiation were developed to synthesize the second-strand. In a first group of methods, initiation of second-strand synthesis takes place within the sequence of the first strand. However, the digestion of the 3' end of the first strand is required and therefore results in the loss of the sequences corresponding to the 5'end of the mRNA. In a second group of methods, initiation of second-strand synthesis takes place outside the sequence of the first strand. This group of methods does not require digestion of the 3' end of the first strand. However, the limitation of this group of method lies upon the elongation. Cloning with T7 DNA polymerase helps overcome this limitation by allowing digestion of the poly(dT) tract during the second- strand synthesis reaction. Therefore, the size of the tract synthesized with terminal transferase is not required to be within a given size range and the resulting clones contain a tract of a limited size. Moreover, due to high 3‚Äô exonuclease activity of T7 DNA polymerase, high yield of the full-length second-strand can be obtained. ===Sequenase (DNA sequencing)=== In Sanger sequencing, one of the major problem regarding DNA polymerases is the discrimination against dideoxynucleotides, the chain-terminating nucleotides. Most of known DNA polymerases strongly discriminate against ddNTP; and thus, a high ratio of ddNTP to dNTP must be used for efficient chain-termination. T7 DNA polymerase discriminates against ddNTP only several fold; and thereby, requires much lower concentration of ddNTP to provide high uniformity of DNA bands on the gel. However, its strong 3‚Äô-5‚Äô exonuclease activity can disrupt the sequencing since when the concentration of dNTP falls, the exonuclease activity increases resulting in no net DNA synthesis or degradation of DNA. In order to use for DNA sequencing, T7 DNA polymerase has been modified to remove its exonuclease activity, either chemically (Sequenase 1.0) or by deletion of residues (Sequenase Version 2.0). == References == Category:EC 2.7.7 Category:DNA replication Category:Viral proteins ","title":"T7 DNA polymerase"},{"id":"19309206","text":"Crimson Skies is an arcade flight video game developed by Zipper Interactive and published in 2000 by Microsoft Game Studios. Although a flight-based game, Crimson Skies is not a genuine flight simulator, as the game is based less on flight mechanics than on action. According to series creator Jordan Weisman, Crimson Skies is \\"not about simulating reality‚Äîit's about fulfilling fantasies.\\" The game is set in an alternate history of the 1930s in which the United States has fragmented into a number of smaller sovereignties, and in which air travel has become the primary mode of transportation in North America. The game centers on Nathan Zachary, an adventurous air pirate seeking to rob the affluent of their wealth and power.\\"I attack the rich and powerful of any nation and take what they treasure most‚Äîtheir money. In doing so I may bring them down a notch and show them they are not untouchable.\\" Throughout the campaign, Zachary leads his gang of air pirates, the Fortune Hunters, on a quest to gain fame and riches. Crimson Skies is often regarded as a \\"cult success\\", commercially successful only to a limited extent. The game has received generally favorable reviews; it has been noted for its high-quality voice acting, gameplay, and atmosphere. Notable technical issues, however, have been known to plague the game, the most notorious of which was the tendency to delete saved game files until a patch was released. ==Gameplay== Crimson Skies is a cross between an authentic flight simulator and an arcade flight game. Although flight mechanics such as lift are still present, the game's planes are generally overpowered, allowing them to perform aerobatic maneuvers impossible in reality under similar circumstances. According to lead game designer John Howard: > We're not trying to build a realistic flight simulation, but at the same > time, Crimson Skies isn't a cartoony, arcade-type game, either. We had to > find a middle ground, where the planes were more powerful, more responsive > and more intuitive to fly, so that the player can just concentrate on being > a hero. GameSpot has stated that \\"the flight model in Crimson Skies is light on the physics and heavy on the barnstorming.\\" In this way, the site likened the game's arcade flight model to the \\"stunt-flying heroics of pulp novel fame\\", in which \\"daredevil pilots performed unbelievable (and quite impossible) feats of showmanship and gunnery.\\" To this effect, the game features select \\"danger zones\\"‚Äîdifficult spaces situated throughout the environment through which the player can fly to dissuade pursuing aircraft. Such stunts are also documented in the player's \\"scrapbook\\", which is the game's record of the player's accomplishments throughout the campaign. The gameplay of Crimson Skies takes place through the player controlling an aircraft through the game's various environments. The game offers three cameras during missions: first-person perspectives with or without a cockpit visible, and a third-person view. The game's heads-up display features basic flight instrumentation such as the compass, altimeter, and speedometer, as well as a damage indicator for the player's aircraft and ammunition displays for the plane's primary and secondary weapons. The game also provides the player with a feature known as the \\"spyglass\\", which provides a magnified image of the selected target and indicates its current heading. The game features eleven different playable aircraft, each of which can be customized. For any aircraft, the player can select its airframe, engine, armor, weapons layout, and paint scheme, although customization is limited by the weight capacity of the airframe and‚Äîin the single-player campaign‚Äîthe player's cash on hand. Outfitting an aircraft with different components affects its performance in terms of speed, maneuverability, stamina, and offense. The player is also able to equip his/her aircraft's guns and hardpoints with different types of ammunition and rockets, respectively. The game's single-player campaign has three difficulty levels, and spans twenty-four missions. Before the start of a mission, the plane and ammunition for both the player and his/her wingman can be selected, although wingmate commands are not available during gameplay. In addition to the campaign, an instant action mode is available which allows the player to play individual missions or customized scenarios. Multiplayer is also available through the Reverb Gaming lobby, over a LAN or the Internet, or via a direct serial connection. Players can host games or join existing ones; the host selects the game's victory conditions and allowable aircraft components/ammunition. Multiplayer game modes include dogfight, capture the flag, and Zeppelin-to-Zeppelin combat. ==PlotSetting=== North America in the fictional Crimson Skies universe The Crimson Skies universe is set in an alternate history of the year 1937. According to the game's backstory, factors such as the growing strength of the \\"Regionalist Party\\", the division between \\"wet\\" and \\"dry\\" states, and a quarantine caused by an Influenza outbreak resulted in a general shift in power from federal to state and local levels. After the Wall Street Crash of '29, states began seceding from the U.S. A number of independent nation-states form from the fractured United States; hostilities between these sovereignties eventually escalate into outright war. After the breakup of America, the former nation's railroad and highway systems fell into disuse as they crossed hostile borders. Consequently, the airplane and the airship became the primary modes of transportation in North America, which in turn gave birth to air piracy. Although air militias formed to defend against the air pirates, continuous brushfire wars between the nations prevent the established governments from effectively repelling the pirate threat. ===Characters=== The player character is Nathan Zachary, a man well known in the game world as a reputable ladies' man and a notorious air pirate. He is the leader of a group of air pirates, the Fortune Hunters. Zachary dislikes the wealthy and privileged, seeing them as selfish and insensitive towards the less privileged; as a result, Zachary and his gang have a penchant for stripping the rich of their money and influence. Zachary's \\"articles of piracy\\" insist that his gang are not to harm the innocent, and that they steal only from those who can afford the loss. IGN has stated that the Fortune Hunters are \\"wonderfully ambiguous [‚Ä¶] in the moral sense\\", qualifying that \\"It's always great to see heroes [‚Ä¶] who aren't too good to be true.\\" The Fortune Hunters are based on the Zeppelin Pandora, and comprise the airship's crew as well as six pilots‚ÄîNathan Zachary and his wingman Jack Mulligan, \\"Tex\\" Ryder and her wingman \\"Buck\\" Deere, \\"Big John\\" Washington and Betty \\"Brooklyn\\" Charles. Later joining Nathan and his gang are Dr. Wilhelm Fassenbiender, a scientist and friend of Nathan's since World War I, as well as his daughter, Dr. Ilse Fassenbiender. Opposing the Fortune Hunters are rival pirates and privateers, such as The Black Swan, Jonathan \\"Genghis\\" Kahn, and Ulysses Boothe. Also fighting Zachary and his gang are private security firms such as Blake Aviation Security and militia squadrons such as the Hollywood Knights. Many of these opponents are old rivals or former love interests of Nathan Zachary. ===Storyline=== Nathan Zachary is a great war hero pilot. Before he meets up with his crew and forms the Fortune Hunters, he saves damsels in distress and fights enemies. Until when he arrives in New York he and his three other wingmen present (Jack, Tex and Big John) hijack the Empire State Zeppelin the FULCRUM and reconstructed it, to the current PANDORA. Three of the FULCRUM's crew also joins the Fortune Hunters (Buck, Betty and Sparks). Soon later down south in Cuba, Nathan and the Fortune Hunters fight against the British and the Medusas in Cuba. Lucas Miles, a fellow Fortune Hunter, attempts to betray them over a score, resulting in Nathan ordering his crew to open fire on Miles' Zeppelin destroying it, and seemingly killing him, while the Fortune Hunters flee to safety. Soon later, the Fortune Hunters and Medusas are socialising, while Nathan is stuck in the PANDORA, sore over the betrayal of his old friend. He refuses to come down, until he mentions of a discovery of a treasure map from Hawaii which he tells Jack. They then head to a group of islands, where they successfully find the treasure, although after finding it they are soon tracked by the Medusas who want the treasure for themselves and the British who want the Hawaiian islands under English rule. The Fortune Hunters repel an initial Medusa attack before fighting the British who attempt to foil their retrieval of the treasure and stealing one of their bombers to locate their base of operations. Finding it at another island where a slave camp and zeppelin dock is being built, they liberate the work camp and steal a zeppelin salvaging mechanism from the zeppelin dock, alongside dealing with another unsuccessful British retaliation involving a submarine. Finally, the Fortune Hunters claim their treasure back in the main island with their new equipment and repel the Medusas one last time along with their leader Justine Perot. On the trip heading away from Hawaii, Nathan receives a call from Dr. Wilhelm Fassenbiender, an old friend he met during the Great War. However it turns to be his daughter Ilsa and she explains that her father has been captured by the Russian Chekka secret police for their reasons, which leads the Fortune Hunters to Pacifica. The Dr. is imprisoned on a passenger Zeppelin belonging to the CCCP, which the Fortune Hunters attack. Nathan and his gang are then attacked by an old flame, The Black Swan and her gang who were staging a robbery on board the Zeppelin. After downing Swan and her crew, he daringly saves the Dr. while up in the air out high. Later back down on land, while fighting the local security firm Blake Aviation Security, Nathan saves Ilsa and steals the Blue Streak Bloodhawk, a prototype plane the Dr. works on with his daughter. When the PANDORA runs low on fuel resources, Nathan suggests a steal of fuel supplies from a Russian tanker, which pits the Fortune Hunters once more against the Russians. Paladin Blake, CEO of Blake Aviation Security then warns the Fortune Hunters to leave Pacifica given Blake has a zeppelin containing an armada of fighters intent on downing Zachary. The Fortune Hunters however sabotage the zeppelin and destroy it, along with Nathan personally fighting Blake himself. Blake loses, and the Fortune Hunters leave Pacifica. The Fortune Hunters' previous activities come back to haunt them however when the CCCP zeppelin that Zachary and his gang attacked and eliminated its escort during their rescue of the Dr. was finally downed at Pacifica's coast by a new mysterious pirate gang, the Black Hats, who intend to abduct the passengers and ask for ransom, Zachary and his gang fight and defeat the Black Hats while defending a Hospital Ship sent to rescue survivors. At the Nation of Hollywood, Nathan remembers his rival Johnny Johnson now handling security affairs as president of Hughes Aviation (the aviation security company there). Nathan decides to knock Johnny given his pompous personality and is able to sneak in Betty into a movie studio where she has a role. The Fortune Hunters then rescue Lana Cooper who is not happy with her contract and wish to escape. After she is rescued in a daring abduction scheme, Johnny, now embarrassed that he failed to keep Hollywood safe, tries to show off publicity by showing Hughes' newest accomplishment the biggest plane ever, named the Spruce Goose. Nathan gets on stealing the giant plane with the help of Betty. With all his convictions, he is invited to an aerial stunt race with aces, pirates, aviators, aviatrixes and even Johnny Johnson himself in the competition, to prove the best pilot. The race however ends in a free for all planned by Johnson to shoot down Zachary, with help from Charlie Steele the leader of the Hollywood Knights whom previously attempted to stop the Fortune Hunters during their abduction of Ms. Cooper and the theft of the Spruce Goose, as rival pirate gang leaders Genghis Khan and Bill Redman also join the fight, Zachary however succeeds in shooting down all of them with assistance from The Black Swan and Loyle Crawford, leader of the Broadway Bombers. Nathan, after the competition realises it is a trap to lure him away from the PANDORA so it can be destroyed by Johnson's military forces and he goes on a one-to-one anti-Zeppelin battle with his crew against Hughes Aviation. Though after battle, the PANDORA was victorious but was in terrible shape, which fortunately the Fortune Hunters have found a cargo zeppelin which can help them get into Sky Haven by towing the damaged PANDORA. The cargo zeppelin is defended by Blake Aviation Security, and thus Nathan and the crew fight them one more time, emerging victorious. While in Sky Haven, Nathan and the Black Swan had lost their crews and now try to get them back. It turns out that they are being hunted by the Black Hats for some unknown reason. Nathan first battles the Black Hats and their apparent leader Ace Dixon again, which also involves a dogfight with a military squadron affiliated with the new security firm Sacred Trust Incoparated, whom appears to be helping the Black Hats on their hunt. He then saves Sparks from an exploding train who beforehand contacted Nathan for help. Sparks explains the crew was kidnapped by the Black Hats themselves, and Nathan goes on a military autogyro fight with Ulysses Boothe, who turns out to be the leader of the Black Hats. Nathan downs Boothe to be taken hostage. Nathan and Swan decide to use Boothe as bait to know of the crews' location in exchange for Boothe. Nathan and Black Swan drop Boothe off and learn the location of the crews which the Black Hats kept in a self-destructing cargo zeppelin. Nathan manages to save the crews and the PANDORA from destruction by the Black Hats who try to double cross them, however Swan is downed and captured in the process. Eventually the Fortune Hunters go to destroy the Black Hat mansion as payback, rescue the Black Swan who was held prisoner and steals aerial torpedoes. Nathan soon uncovers evidence of an alliance between Sacred Trust Incorporated. and the Black Hats; they are planning to conquer the entire divided America, especially with their influence over the Empire State and its capitol Manhattan and decides that he'll need help from Blake in order to stop them both. The Fortune Hunters intercept a Black Hat attack on Blake. Earning trust and their enmity gone, Blake and Nathan work together in destroying the Black Hats. Nathan and Blake head to New York, where they try to deal with Sacred Trust personally. After a tip-off from a taxi gyro Nathan sabotages the Black Hats in one of their illegal operations where he destroys a German freighter and warehouse containing their stolen loot which was to be shipped to Berlin. Later, the Fortune Hunters learn that a Sacred Trust accountant named Waldo Carney has evidence of Black Hat pirates and German spies working undercover in the firm, and tries to flee the country, but is under attack by the Black Hats while flying on board a zeppelin liner. Nathan saves Carney, delivering him to the police for safety. Acting on Carney's information, the Fortune Hunters sabotage attempts by Sacred Trust in getting their loot away back to Germany via three cargo zeppelins in which they were to rendezvous with a fleet of Luftwaffe fighters waiting outside international waters as their escorts. They stop Sacred Trust, as well as the Spruce Goose as well which was thought to be lost beforehand, but was really bought by Sacred Trust to be used as a secret getaway plane. Zachary and his gang soon learn that the leader of the STI- Black Hat forces is none other than their former nemesis Lucas Miles whom was believed to have been killed in Cuba, a year earlier. Miles and his gang challenge The Fortune Hunters for one last confrontation over the streets of Manhattan. The Fortune Hunters with the help from The Black Swan are victorious in the battle over Broadway. Nathan then gives chase to Lucas who has taken Miss Cooper hostage but she bails out safely before she can be killed, resulting Nathan being able to shoot Lucas down, where he is presumed dead. Nathan is offered membership to Blake Aviation but turns it down; Blake is outraged with his choice to stay a pirate, but Nathan cuts him off. Nathan plans with the Black Swan on stealing South American treasure as their zeppelins along with their plane squadrons fly off into the sunset. ==Development== Jordan Weisman, series creator and creative director of Crimson Skies, has said of the game: \\"Our whole goal is to give the player the kind of role of being Errol Flynn in a 1930's, 1940's great pirate adventure film of the air.\\" According to Weisman, the inspiration for the game came after he had done research on the early years of aviation; he wished to create a game about the era. Weisman and Dave McCoy came up with the concept of \\"combining the classic fantasies of pilots and pirates.\\" They then created the series' backstory by proposing changes to the history of the United States that would allow the rise of air piracy. Development on the game originally began for Virtual World Entertainment, and was changed to a PC game under the name \\"Corsairs!\\". This original project was shelved, however, prompting Weisman and others to create the board game Crimson Skies. When FASA later became a part of Microsoft, Weisman was given the opportunity to work on a new project; his choice was to restart production of the Crimson Skies PC game. The original version of the game shipped with numerous technical problems, one of the most notorious was the tendency to delete the player's saved game files.\\"Unless the patch is downloaded, the game may spontaneously reset the player's \\"campaign mode\\" progress to mission one when playing multiplayer or customizing a plane in Instant Action.\\" Shortly after the game's release, Microsoft released Crimson Skies Update Version 1.01, a patch specifically designed to fix this problem. Microsoft later released Update Version 1.02 to address other issues, including multiplayer game stability and mission load times. Recent ATI and Nvidia drivers do not support this game. As such it was only possible to play it in Software Rendering mode. Several fans tried to identify and find the causes of this problem, later gathering at the Nvidia forums, and asking Nvidia for a fix. Nvidia did not show availability for this. The fanbase tried several paths to a solution, culminating in asking known game graphic modder Timeslip if he could devise a fix. The unofficial patch is available at Timeslip's homepage, fixes the issue with current graphic drivers and improves the game in some aspects, such as allowing higher resolutions. ==Reception== CNET Gamecenter's Mark Asher noted that Crimson Skies was commercially unsuccessful.https://web.archive.org/web/20010124081400/http://www.gamecenter.com/News/Item/0,3,0-5178,00.html It is regarded as a \\"cult favorite\\" or a \\"cult success\\", generally popular only within a limited \\"cult following.\\" The game, however, has received generally favorable critical reviews. GameSpot said that \\"Crimson Skies does an excellent job of taking the elements of flight simulations that have broad appeal‚Äîthe shooting and the fancy flying‚Äîand embellishing them with a great environment and a good story.\\" IGN called the game \\"highly inventive, tons of fun and ridiculously addictive\\", and ranked the game as #65 and #75 respectively on its 2003 and 2005 lists of the \\"Top 100 Games of All Time.\\" IGN lauded the game's arcade-style physics model, stating that it made gameplay \\"exciting and immediate.\\" GameSpot likewise complimented the arcade flight model, stating that it fit with the game's pulp fiction setting and allowed for elaborate stunt flying and fast-paced dogfighting. Other positively received aspects of gameplay include the game's \\"scrapbook\\" and aircraft customization features. The game's visuals were generally well- received, as was its audio. Critics took particular note of the game's voice talent, which was described as among the best found in computer games up to that time. The Crimson Skies universe was also well-received by critics, who found it highly original and described it as an \\"alternate history that is rare in being both compelling and believable.\\" Critics also commended the way these elements‚Äîvoice acting, soundtrack, graphics style, and story‚Äîcombined to contribute to the game's 1930s pulp fiction atmosphere. The single-player campaign in Crimson Skies was criticized for its overall linearity, and GameSpot found that multiple playthroughs of a mission would become \\"tiresome.\\" The game was most heavily dispraised, however, for its numerous and notable technical issues, which include choppy framerate, missing textures, crash bugs, slowdown during menu screens, flawed wingman AI, long loading times for game levels, and the unreliability of saved game files. IGN commented that \\"there are some serious issues with the game that need to be addressed [‚Ä¶] in order to help the game realize its amazing potential.\\" According to GameSpot, \\"Unfortunately, the game is [‚Ä¶] a reminder of how easily technical problems can defeat a promising design.\\" Edge magazine has stated that gameplay is directly affected by these problems, as long loading times force players to \\"play it safe\\" and avoid the \\"improbable stunts that should be the signature of [the] game\\"; the review concludes it's \\"A shame, because in its variety of missions and sheer panache, the dashing Crimson Skies almost steals your heart. \\" Chris Kramer reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that \\"This game is a breath of fresh air; fun, fantastic, and different.\\" The editors of Computer Games Magazine nominated Crimson Skies for their 2000 \\"Sci-Fi Simulation of the Year\\" award. ==See also== *Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge == References  External links == * Crimson Skies at MobyGames Category:2000 video games Category:Alternate history video games Category:Arcade games Category:Combat flight simulators Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in 1937 Category:Windows games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games ","title":"Crimson Skies (video game)"},{"id":"19309209","text":"Robert Browne (died October 1603) was an English actor of the Elizabethan era, and the owner and manager of the Boar's Head Theatre. He was also part of an enduring confusion in the study of English Renaissance theatre. ==Two Robert Brownes== The relevant documents of English Renaissance drama contain numerous references to \\"Robert Browne.\\" Early twentieth-century scholars, like E. K. ChambersE. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 2, p. 304. and Edwin Nunzeger,Edwin Nunzeger, A Dictionary of Actors and of Others Associated with the Representation of Plays in England Before 1642, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1929; pp. 60-3. assumed that these records referred to a single individual. Later scholars, principally Charles Jasper SissonsC. J. Sisson, \\"Mr. and Mrs. Brown of the Boar's Head,\\" Life and Letters Today, Vol. 15 No. 6 (Winter 1936), pp. 99-107.C. J. Sisson, The Boar's Head Theatre: An Inn-yard Theatre of the Elizabethan Age, Stanley Wells, ed., London, Routledge, 1972. and Herbert Berry,Herbert Berry, The Boar's Head Playhouse, Washington DC, Folger Books, 1986. argued persuasively that two separate individuals had been confused and conflated into one. Or two at least: \\"There were obviously at least two and could easily have been three or more Robert Brownes who had to do with the companies and playhouses of the time.\\"Berry, p. 197. To distinguish between two Robert Brownes, the earliest years of the seventeenth century are key. One Robert Browne was busy running the Boar's Head Theatre in 1601 through 1603; another Robert Browne was performing with English actors in Germany between 1601 and 1607. The Boar's Head Browne died in 1603, and so can reasonably be termed an Elizabethan actor. The career of the \\"other\\" Robert Browne extended through the first two decades of the seventeenth century; he can sensibly be called a Jacobean actor. ==The Elizabethan actor== The Robert Browne who is the subject of this article was the man who ran the Boar's Head Theatre, and who was married to Susan Browne (later Susan Greene, later Susan Baskervile) and the father of their five children, including the actor William Browne (1602-34). Browne of the Boar's Head was in all likelihood the Browne who was a leader among the acting troupe Derby's Men, and who received payments for Court performances by Derby's Men in 1600 and 1601.Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 127. A Robert Browne wrote to Edward Alleyn in 1589;Nunzeger, p. 60. when the subject of this article died in October 1603, Joan Alleyn wrote the news to her husband. The later Robert Browne wrote to Alleyn in 1612,Nunzeger, p. 62. showing that the Alleyns knew both men. Concerning Edward Alleyn and the two Brownes, one scholar has written, \\"From the scanty record it would appear that the first was of particular interest to Alleyn but not on good terms, while the second appears, from occasional notes to Alleyn, to have been confident and respectful.\\"Muriel C. Bradbrook, Shakespeare in His Context, Lanham, MD, Rowman & Littlefield, 1989; p. 150. It is not impossible that there was a family relationship between the two Brownes, since familial connections were common among actors and theatre people in the era: consider John and Lawrence DuttonChambers, Vol. 2, pp. 314-15; Nunzeger, pp. 123-6. in Queen Elizabeth's Men, Anthony and Humphrey JeffesChambers, Vol. 2, p. 324; Nunzeger, pp. 203-5. in the Admiral's Men a generation later, plus Robert Pallant father and son (apparently),Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 331; Nunzeger, pp. 263-5. and other such pairs. To compound the confusion, both Robert Brownes had sons named Robert Browne. ==References * The Biographical Index of English Drama Before 1660, on the Brownes.

Rebstock on the shores of Lake Erie in 1888. Rebstock turned it into a full-fledged amusement park in 1890. In 1896, the Ontario Southern Railway began to provide connection between the park and the mainline rail station in Ridgeway. This service consisted of a unique elevated monorail style train, and ran for only three summers, through 1898. Boat service connected nearby Buffalo with the park. Initially, in the 1890s, a ferry service operated small boats with a capacity of 500 to 1,200. The Americana held 3,000 passengers and operated between 1908 and 1929. The Canadiana also held 3,000 passengers and operated between 1910 and 1956. A concrete pier was constructed to service the Americana and Canadiana in 1921.http://cec.chebucto.org/ClosPark/Crystal.html The park's first roller coaster was a Figure 8 model that operated from 1905 to 1915. The park's second roller coaster, Backety-Back Scenic Railway, operated from 1909 to 1926. The third was the Giant Coaster that began operation in 1916. John E. Rebstock sold the park to George C. Hall in 1924.

It is a drug used to treat symptomatic hypercalcemia secondary to cancer. It works by preventing the breakdown of bone through the inhibition of osteoclast activity, thus lowering the amount of free calcium in the blood.Gallium Nitrate monograph. Lexi-Comp Online, Lexi-Drugs Online, Lexi-Comp Inc. Hudson, OH. Available at: . Accessed September 13th, 2008.Ganite at drugs.com Gallium nitrate is also used to synthesize other gallium compounds. ==History== Gallium (Ga) was discovered in 1875 by P.√â. Lecoq de Boisbaudran. In most of its compounds, gallium is found with an oxidation number of 3+. Gallium chemically behaves similarly to iron 3+ when forming a coordination complex. That means gallium(III) and iron(III) are similar in similar coordination number, electrical charge, ion diameter and electron configuration. ===Biological activity=== Gallium atoms are bound to the phosphates of DNA at low gallium concentrations, forming a stable complex. Gallium competes with magnesium in DNA binding, since its DNA affinity is 100 times higher than that of magnesium. No interactions have been found between the metal and DNA bases. According to Hedley et al., gallium inhibits replicative DNA synthesis, the major gallium-specific target probably being ribonucleotide reductase. In addition to that, it was reported by Chitambar that gallium binds to transferrin more strongly than iron. The transferrin gallium complex inhibits DNA synthesis by acting on the M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. Gallium(III) seems to act as an antagonist to the actions of several ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+ and Zn2+) in processes of cellular metabolism. The action of gallium on bone metabolism decreases hypercalcemia associated with cancer. However, gallium is mostly found within the cell as a salt in lysosomes. ==Preparation== Gallium nitrate is commercially available as the hydrate. The nonahydrate may also be prepared by dissolving gallium in nitric acid, followed by recrystallization. The structure of gallium nitrate nonahydrate has been determined by X-ray crystallography. ==Use and manufacturingPreparation of gallium nitride from gallium nitrate=== GaN powder was prepared by heating gallium nitrate salt in flowing ammonia to a high temperature that range between 500-1050 ¬∞C. The salt was converted to GaN by monitoring X-ray diffraction and Gallium magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy. Balkas_, C. M.; Davis, R. F. J. Am. Ceram. Soc. 1996, 79, 2309 ===Medication Information=== Gallium nitrate injection is a clear, colorless, odorless, sterile solution of gallium nitrate, a hydrated nitrate salt of the group IIIa element, gallium. The stable, nonahydrate, Ga(NO3)3‚Ä¢9H2O is a white, slightly hygroscopic, crystalline powder of molecular weight 417.87, that is readily soluble in water. Each mL of Ganite (gallium nitrate injection) contains gallium nitrate 25 mg (on an anhydrous basis) and sodium citrate dihydrate 28.75 mg. The solution may contain sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid for pH adjustment to 6.0-7.0. Gallium Nitrate. National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine. April 13th, 2012 ===Overdose=== Use of higher doses of gallium nitrate than recommended may cause nausea, vomiting and increases risk of chronic kidney disease. In the case of overdose, serum calcium should be monitored, patients should receive vigorous hydration for 2‚Äì3 days and any further drug administrations should be discontinued. ==Treatment== The action of gallium in gallium nitrate on bone metabolism decreases the hypercalcemia associated with cancer. Gallium inhibits osteoclastic activity and therefore decreases hydroxyapatite crystal formation, with adsorption of gallium onto the surfaces of hydroxyapatite crystals. Also, the increased concentration of gallium in the bone leads to increasing the synthesis of collagen as well as the formation of the bone tissue inside the cell. It has been reported that a protracted infusion was effective against cancer-associated hypercalcemia. Preliminary studies in bladder carcinoma, carcinoma of the urothelium and lymphomas are also promising. Another interesting schedule of subcutaneous injection with low doses of gallium nitrate has been proposed, especially for the treatment of bone metastases, but the definitive results have not yet been published. ==Chemical Reactivity== Gallium nitrate can react with reducing agents to generate heat and products that may be gaseous. The products may themselves be capable of further reactions (such as combustion in the air). The chemical reduction of materials in this group can be rapid, but often requires initiation of heat, catalyst and addition of a solvent. Explosive mixtures of gallium nitrate with reducing agents often persist unchanged for long periods if initiation is prevented. Some inorganic oxidizing agents such as gallium nitrate are salts of metals that are soluble in water; dissolution dilutes but does not nullify the oxidizing power of such materials. Generally, inorganic oxidizing agents can react violently with active metals, cyanides, esters, and thiocyanates. ==Adverse ReactionKidney=== Adverse renal effects have been reported in about 12.5% of patients treated with gallium nitrate. Two patients receiving gallium nitrate and one patient receiving calcitonin developed acute renal failure in a controlled trial of patients with cancer-related hypercalcemia. Also, it was reported that gallium nitrate should not be administered to patients with serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dL. ===Blood Pressure=== In a controlled trial of patients, it was noticed a decrease in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure after the treatment with gallium nitrate. The decrease in blood pressure was asymptomatic and did not require specific treatment. ===Hematologic=== High doses of gallium nitrate were associated with anemia when used in treating patients for advanced cancer. In results, several patients have received red blood cell transfusions. ==See also== *Bone resorption ==References * Ganite, brand website Category:Gallium compounds Category:Nitrates ","title":"Gallium nitrate"},{"id":"19309241","text":"La Guzm√°n is a live album by Mexican singer Alejandra Guzm√°n.

Kamal-ol-Molk stayed in France and Italy in the last years of the nineteenth century to study the works of Europe‚Äôs greatest artists. Kamal-ol-Molk style, inspired by his stay in Europe, is based on Realism and Naturalism. He founded the School of Fine Arts (Mostazrafe) in 1908 where European style of painting was taught together with Iran‚Äôs traditional painting. This was a breakthrough in the Iranian painting that for centuries was dominated mainly by miniatures used in illustration and decoration of books. right ==Early life and family== Kazem Ordoobadi was born in 1919 and was the youngest of four children by Mohammad-Hassan Company and Rafieh Ordoobadi. His maternal grandfather, Haj Abbas Ordoobadi, emigrated from the city of Ordubad in Nakhchivan province, then part of the Russian Empire, to Iran and settled in Shiraz. ==Career== Ordoobadi started painting when he was in high school. His family had a long history of artists. His father was a skilled calligrapher and had written in the Nastaleeq () style several works of famous Iranian poets. His cousin Khalil Negargar was a refined watercolor painter. Ordoobadi‚Äôs earliest extant work is a small watercolor painting on a cardboard dated 1941, when he was 22 years old. The perfect use of colors and space shows that he already mastered his art. Later Ordoobadi‚Äôs acquaintance with Ostad Mahmoud Olia, a distinguished disciple of Kamal-ol-Molk, opened new horizons to him. Ordoobadi painted several portraits of personalities, family members and friends. The origin of his interest in portraits should be sought in the influence of Mahmoud Olia. In particular his earlier works come very close to the works of his master in terms of technique, lighting and color rendition. However he gradually gained assurance and departed from his master towards a more personal style. The influence of Olia however remained intact in Ordoobadi‚Äôs pencil drawings. His pencil drawing copy of Murillo‚Äôs \\"Inmaculada de Soult\\" or Rembrandt‚Äôs \\"self-portrait\\" are examples of Olia's influence. These works demonstrate the dexterity of the artist using his pencil to give life to lines and shades. In Ordoobadi‚Äôs early oil paintings the inspirations of Olia could also be seen in the selection of colors, movements and brush strokes. His oil paintings evolved later when he got interested in landscapes and painted a number of works of the Russian realist painter Ivan Shishkin. The influence of realist landscape painters is visible in his later works depicting the life of Qashqai nomads of Fars in their natural environment. Later on, Ordoobadi started studying impressionism and found a great interest in that school. He was impressed by the freedom in brush strokes, transparent colors and strong lights used by the masters. He painted several works in the style the French impressionist painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir and his later works were greatly influenced by this school. Ordoobadi painted portraits of a selection of personalities which include outstanding figures associated with cultural and artistic circles of his time. His portraits of Fereydoun Tavallali (celebrated poet), Mirza Kazemi and Hashem Javid (man of letters), Naser Namazi (painter), Mohammad-Reza Moharreri (artist and doctor) show Ordoobadi‚Äôs active participation to the dynamic cultural and literary life of Shiraz. After Obtaining his bachelor's degree in Physics in University of Tehran Ordoobadi started his professional life as a high-school teacher. He taught Physics and Art to high school students in Shiraz for thirty years. He acted as director of the Audio-Visual institute with the mission of taking culture to the heart of Fars province‚Äôs villages and nomad regions. During his numerous trips to the remote areas of Fars he studied nomads‚Äô lifestyle and painted some of the scenes of their day-to-day life. Later he was appointed as director of Archeological Institute of Fars province and helped to preserve the cultural heritage and historical treasures of ancient Iran. Ordoobadi died in 2002 at age of 83. == Notes  Category:Iranian painters Category:People from Shiraz Category:Azerbaijani painters Category:Azerbaijani portrait painters ","title":"Kazem Ordoobadi"},{"id":"19309250","text":"Riccardo Fogli (born 21 October 1947 in Pontedera, Province of Pisa, Italy) is an Italian singer. ==BiographyEarly career=== Riccardo Fogli was born on 21 October 1947 in Pontedera. He was fond of music since his childhood and taught himself to play the electric bass guitar. At 14 years old he started working in the Piaggio factory.Nicola Sisto. \\"Fogli, Riccardo\\". Gino Castaldo (edited by). Dizionario della canzone italiana. Curcio Editore, 1990. pp. 690‚Äì1. In 1964, at the age of 17, Fogli joined the band Gli Slenders. Two years later, in 1966, he became the lead singer of Pooh. In 1973, at the peak of popularity with the band, because of personal problems (the breakup of his marriage and a tempestuous relationship with singer Patty Pravo), he left Pooh and started his solo career. In 1973, Fogli issued his first album Ciao amore come stai (Hello, Love, How Are You?), which was followed by his second album Riccardo Fogli in 1976; the song \\"Mondo\\" (\\"World\\") from this album became a hit. ===1980s=== The 1980s were a pinnacle of success for Riccardo Fogli. In this period, the lyrics of his songs became more philosophical and his singing manner became more emotional. In 1981, Fogli performed one of his most famous and lyrical song, \\"Malinconia\\" (\\"Melancholy\\"), and in 1982 he was the winner of the Festival di Sanremo with his other hit \\"Storie di tutti i giorni\\" (\\"Everyday Stories\\") His 1982 album Collezione (Collection) was issued in nearly a million copies in Western Europe, Japan and the USSR, where he became particularly popular.

(1 June 1901). \\"THE CRISIS.\\"; A Story of the Civil War by the Author of \\"Richard Carvel\\", The New York Times It was the best-selling book in the United States in 1901. The novel is set in the years leading up to the first battles of the American Civil War, mostly in the divided state of Missouri. It follows the fortunes of young Stephen Brice, a man with Union and abolitionist sympathies, and his involvement with a Southern family. ==Story== Set in the author's home town of St. Louis, Missouri, the site of pivotal events in the western theater of the Civil War, with historically prominent citizens having both Northern and Southern sympathies. St. Louis was also the pre-war home of both Ulysses Grant and William T. Sherman, each of whom is depicted in the book. Romantic tension develops between the four main characters: one, Virginia \\"Jinny\\" Carvel, the fashionable daughter of Comyn Carvel, a southern gentleman of the old school; another, Clarence Maxwell Colfax, her n'er-do-well cousin who becomes a stalwart cavalier in the Southern cause in an effort to win Jinny's approval; the third, Stephen A. Brice, an earnest young lawyer from Boston who antagonizes Virginia by his zeal for Abraham Lincoln's cause; and the fourth, Eliphalet Hopper, a hard-working clerk with ambitions to advance himself both financially and socially. The crisis of the title is provoked by Abraham Lincoln's opposition to the extension of slavery, and the power of his personal integrity to win people to his cause, including the young lawyer Brice, who becomes a devoted admirer and proponent following a personal interview on the eve of the Freeport debate between Lincoln and Stephen Douglas. This meeting depicts Lincoln's determination to advance the cause of freedom through the possible (and likely) sacrifice of his own political ambitions, and is related with a very believable combination of rustic humor and political acumen on Lincoln's part. The events prior to Lincoln's nomination and his eventual election to the Presidency elicit different reactions among the citizens of St. Louis, from the determined antipathy of the Southern sympathizers, to the equally determined patriotism of the population of German immigrants who have fled from their homeland and whose devotion to liberty has caused them to transfer their allegiance to the ideal of American democracy. One of them is Stephen's fellow lawyer, Carl Richter, who bears the scar of a duel fought with broadswords between himself and an arrogant German noble; a duel based on an actual incident in Berlin. Although the personal rivalries follow an almost soap opera style formula, the overall events of the war from the perspective of St. Louis and the Western theater of war are dramatically depicted with well-researched authenticity, and both Grant and Sherman are depicted as having a personal involvement in the lives of the main characters. A pivotal moment in the heroine's life is presented through her transformation from being self-centered and self-absorbed to becoming self-sacrificing and dedicated to easing the suffering of those around her. This is represented as a Christian metaphor for the way that God uses challenges to mould a person's character. In the end, Virginia and the young lawyer find themselves meeting Lincoln together to try to save her cousin's life after Clarence is condemned as a Southern spy, and together they experience Lincoln's power to bring about a reconciliation between them, just before the national reconciliation which Lincoln proposed between the North and the South would be aborted by John Wilkes Booth's bullet. This novel is a story about Abraham Lincoln in the same sense that the novel Ben Hur is \\"a tale of the Christ,\\" in that Lincoln only appears twice, for a total of about two dozen pages, but his philosophy is a dynamic presence throughout the story. The author portrays Lincoln as being the sacrifice America had to pay to redeem it from the sin of slavery. In his post-script, the author offers this justification for supporting Lincoln's point of view, \\"Lincoln loved both the South and the North\\". ==Reception== The book received good reviews,Current Encyclopedia, Vol. 1, p. 179-80 (July 1901) and was the best-selling book in the United States for 1901, according to The Bookman magazine. ==AdaptationsStage=== James K. Hackett and Charlotte Walker in The Crisis (1902) The author adapted the novel into a play of four acts in 1902. James K. Hackett produced, directed and starred in the play, appearing in numerous cities, and at Wallack's Theater on Broadway on November 11, 1902,https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/the-crisis-5656, accessed Nov 24, 2017. for 50 performances. The scenes were set entirely in St. Louis, with only the fictitious characters as the cast. Historical personages and events are talked about, not shown. The play begins with Brice's arrival in 1857, and ends at the reception room of Judge Whipple's office after the Judge's death and Brice threatens Eliphalet Hopper with exposure of his crooked dealings if he exposes Col. Carvel to the authorities.The Crisis: A Play in Four Acts, (New York, NY: Samuel French, 1927) ===Film=== The book was adapted into a silent film of the same name in 1916. ==References *The Crisis at Project Gutenberg *The Crisis, full book scan of 1901 edition at Google books Category:American historical novels Category:1901 American novels Category:Novels set during the American Civil War Category:Novels set in St. Louis Category:Novels by Winston Churchill (novelist) Category:American novels adapted into films ","title":"The Crisis (novel)"},{"id":"19309312","text":"Lester Hamilton Kelly (14 February 1892 ‚Äì 6 January 1958) was an Australian rules footballer who played with the Melbourne University Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL).The University Team, The Leader, (Saturday, 4 May 1912), p.29. ==Family== The son of Rev.

The bill would amend the findings of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 by including the desecration of cemeteries among the various violations of the right to religious freedom. Meng said that \\"this legislation would be a new and important tool in our fight against the desecration of cemeteries\\" because it would \\"combat religiously-motivated vandalism of cemeteries and also prevent developers from building over cemeteries, a new and emerging threat in places where there are no Jewish communities left to protect burial grounds.\\" In 2015, Meng was heavily opposed to the Iran Nuclear Deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action supported by President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry. https://meng.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/meng-opposes-nuclear-deal- with-iran In 2017, Meng boycotted Donald Trump's inauguration in protest of him.

In its original form, designated the Kup√© (Danish: \\"Coup√©\\") it was a low-wing cantilever monoplane of conventional design with fixed tailwheel undercarriage and two seats side by side under an enclosed canopy. The fuselage structure was of steel tube, skinned in plywood and fabric, and the wings were wooden with plywood covering and could be folded back along the fuselage for transport and storage. This was followed by the aerobatic KZ II Sport with a revised fuselage design, placing the two seats in separate open cockpits in tandem, and a dedicated military trainer version along the same lines, the KZ II Tr√¶ner (\\"Trainer\\"). This latter type was first produced in 1946, as a step towards rebuilding Denmark's air force after the war. They remained in service until 1955, when nine examples were sold into private hands.

Palmer led the team of firefighters that reached the 78th floor of the South Tower, the floor where the plane had struck the building. According to The 9/11 Commission Report, audio and video recordings prominently featuring Orio Palmer have played an important role in the ongoing analysis of problems with radio communications during the September 11 attacks. ==Personal life== Palmer had three children. He graduated from Cardinal Spellman High School in The Bronx, New York in 1974. He held an associate degree in electrical technology. According to John Norman, Palmer was very fit and ran marathon races. Historian Peter Charles Hoffer wrote that Palmer was \\"in superb condition\\". ==Career== Reporter Michael Daly wrote, \\"The 45-year-old Palmer was one of the department's rising stars, renowned for his smarts and nerve and decency, as well as his physical fitness.\\" He was married to Debbie Palmer, and had three children, Dana, Keith and Alyssa. Palmer finished the New York City marathon as well as a dozen half-marathons and a couple of triathlons. Orio was also the first FDNY member to be awarded the department's physical fitness award five times. He was said to be one of the \\"most knowledgeable people in the department\\" about radio communication in high-rise fires, and authored a training article for the department on how to use repeaters to boost radio reception during such emergencies. Palmer was also published in a number of nationally distributed firefighting magazines as well as the internal FDNY newsletter. He also taught FDNY promotional classes at night while working toward his own bachelor's degree in Fire Engineering from John Jay College. ==September 11North Tower lobby=== Footage of Palmer was used in the CBS film 9/11, and later in the HBO film In Memoriam: New York City, 9/11/01. The video footage was shot by French documentary filmmaker Jules Naudet at the North Tower. It shows Palmer conferring with Deputy Chief Peter Hayden and Assistant Chief Donald Burns at the North Tower. The South Tower had just been hit. The men discuss how to respond to the two towers, and the communications problems they faced. The sound of a falling body hitting pavement outside reverberates. According to Michael Daly, \\"Palmer stood steady and calm, an air pack on his back, a red flashlight bound with black elastic to his white helmet, a radio in his left hand. His face showed only a readiness to do whatever was needed.\\" The men decided that Burns and Palmer would proceed to the South Tower. ===Ascent of South Tower=== United Airlines Flight 175 strikes the 78th floor of the South Tower. After the first plane struck the North Tower at 8:46 am, Chief Palmer helped organize operations there. Soon after the second plane hit the South Tower at 9:03 am., Palmer moved into that building with Chief Burns. Although most elevators had been rendered non-operational, Palmer found a working one and took it to the 41st floor, which was halfway to the impact zone, which spanned the 77th to the 85th floors.https://www.fireengineering.com/articles/print/volume-155/issue-9/world- trade-center-disaster/volume-i-initial-response/first-chief-on-the-scene.html About 14 or 15 minutes before the South Tower collapsed, a group of people who had survived the plane's impact began their descent from the 78th floor. As they departed, Palmer sent word to Chief Edward Geraghty that a group of 10 people, some of whom exhibited injuries, were heading to an elevator on the 41st floor, the only one left working by the plane's impact. However, on its last trip down, the car became stuck in the shaft. Inside the elevator was a Ladder 15 firefighter who reported that he was trying to break open the walls. It is unclear whether the group of 10 had reached that elevator before it left the 41st floor, but those who listened to the tape said it was most unlikely that they had enough time to escape, by the elevator or by stairs.Dwyer, Jim; Fessenden, Ford (August 4, 2002). \\"Lost Voices of Firefighters, Some on the 78th Floor\\". The New York Times. Remnants of the South Tower after its collapse When an audiotape of communication with the firefighters was released, it revealed that firefighters did not anticipate the building's collapse. Palmer, issuing an order to one of his subordinates, was recorded seconds before the building collapsed. Peter Charles Hoffer described Palmer's professionalism during the final moments of his life: \\"Listening to Palmer and his comrades on the recovered tape, one can hear the urgency of men working at high efficiency, but there was never a hint that the clock was running out on them.\\" Transcripts of Palmer's last broadcast were published in 2002. The actual recordings were made public in 2005, as the result of a lawsuit filed by The New York Times and families of some of the firefighters killed on September 11. Monica Gabrielle of the Skyscraper Safety Campaign commented on the release of the tapes: \\"Today we are one step closer to learning what happened on 9/11 in NYC ‚Äî where we excelled, where we failed.\\" According to The Times of London, \\"Chief Palmer made it to the impact zone on the 78th floor of the south tower before the building collapsed. Once there the battalion chief reported 'Numerous 10‚Äì45s, Code Ones' ‚Äî fire department code for dead people.\\" When new tapes were made public in 2006, Palmer's brother- in-law, FDNY Lt. Jim McCaffrey, stated, \\"It was emotional sitting with my wife and sister-in-law, listening to the tapes. You're hearing him right at that point prior to the collapse, about the things he saw on the 78th floor. Before that, we didn't even know he got higher than the 40th floor.\\" Mirror ===Role in analysis of 9/11=== The 9/11 Commission Report In 2004, The 9/11 Commission Report relied on analysis of the North Tower lobby conversations between Palmer, Peter Hayden and Donald Burns in the film shot by Jules and Gedeon Naudet to better understand what was and was not working on the fire department's communications in those critical minutes. The report stated that, \\"Of particular concern to the chiefs‚Äîin light of FDNY difficulties in responding to the 1993 bombing‚Äîwas communications capability. One of the chiefs recommended testing the repeater channel to see if it would work.\\" Peter Hayden, who survived, later testified, \\"People watching on TV certainly had more knowledge of what was happening a hundred floors above us than we did in the lobby.... [W]ithout critical information coming in... it's very difficult to make informed, critical decisions\\". The 9/11 Commission carefully analyzed the FDNY radio communications that day, and reported that the battalion chief (Palmer) was able to maintain radio communication that \\"worked well\\" with the senior chief in the lobby of the South Tower during the first fifteen minutes of his ascent. A message from a World Trade Center security official (Rick Rescorla) that the impact was on the 78th floor was relayed to Palmer, and he decided to try to take his team to that level. Beginning at 9:21 AM, Palmer was no longer able to reach the lobby command post, but his transmissions were recorded and analyzed later. He reached the 78th floor sky lobby, and his team not far behind him were able to free a group of civilians trapped in an elevator at 9:58 AM. Palmer radioed that the area was open to the 79th floor, \\"well into the impact zone\\", and reported \\"numerous civilian fatalities in the area\\". One minute later, at 9:59 AM, the South Tower collapsed, killing everyone still inside, including Palmer and FDNY Marshal Ronald Bucca. Michael Daly concluded that Palmer, \\"an uncommonly brave fire chief who was one of the department's most knowledgeable minds in communications perished never knowing of warnings telephoned by at least two callers less than 30 stories above him.\\" Although they lost their lives themselves, Palmer and his crew had played an \\"indispensable role in ensuring calm in the stairwells, assisting the injured and guiding the evacuees on the lower floors.\\" ==Legacy== Palmer's name is on Panel S-17 of the National September 11 Memorial's South Pool, along with those of other first responders. After his death, the FDNY's physical fitness award was renamed the Orio Palmer Memorial Fitness Award in his memory after September 11, 2001. In 2002, a portion of East 234th Street between Vireo and Webster Avenues in the Bronx was renamed \\"Deputy Chief Orio J. Palmer Way.\\" At the National 9/11 Memorial, Palmer is memorialized at the South Pool, on Panel S-17. In an early-morning ceremony on May 10, 2014, the long-unidentified remains of 1,115 victims were transferred from the city medical examiner's to Ground Zero, where they would be placed in a space in the bedrock 70 feet below ground, as part of the 9/11 Museum. Reaction to the move was split among the families of the 9/11 victims, with some hailing the decision, and others protesting the location as inappropriate. Among the latter was Orio Palmer's brother-in-law, FDNY Lt. James McCaffrey, who demanded a ground-level tomb as a more dignified location. Said McCaffrey, \\"The decision to put the human remains of the 9/11 dead in this basement is inherently disrespectful and totally offensive.\\" McCaffrey stated that the remains deserves a place of prominence equal to that of the Memorial's trees and pools, and opined that the ceremony was held early in the morning due to opposition to the decision.Stepansky, Joseph; Badia, Erik; McShane, Larry (May 11, 2014). \\"The Anger Remains\\".

Led by the Senior Unofficial Member of the Executive and Legislative Councils Allen Lee, it was established on 12 December 1991 by a group of 21 appointed and indirectly elected Legislative Council members from the functional constituencies. It became the largest conservative faction in the legislature countering the pro-democracy United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK) won a landslide victory in the first direct Legislative Council election in 1991. In 1993, it was transformed into the Liberal Party. ==HistoryFoundation=== After the first ever direct election for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo) in September 1991, the pro-democracy United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK) swept the polls and became the largest party in the legislature. The group of conservative elites in the legislature who were either appointed by the governor or indirectly elected through the functional constituencies shared a dislike for the United Democrats. Four of the Legislative Council members, Allen Lee, Selina Chow, Rita Fan and Edward Ho had also been appointed members of the Executive Council (ExCo). To curb the influence of liberals, 21 conservative legislators formed the CRC as a think tank, research unit and brain trust for a future political group on the 16th floor of the Hong Kong Club in Central. Led by the Senior Unofficial Member Allen Lee and his fellow LegCo colleagues, Steven Poon, Selina Chow and Stephen Cheong, 12 legislators appointed by the British colonial government and 8 legislators indirectly elected by the functional constituencies aligned themselves. Being the convenor of the group, Allen Lee and stood down as the Senior Unofficial Member of the Legislative Council to avoid a conflict of interest. Within a month, CRC had secured 17 of the 32 convenor and deputy convenor posts of the Legislative Council panels. By January 1992, the group issued a joint statement stating that \\"members agree at this point the CRC is not a political party but a political entity formed by a group of legislators in order to serve the people of Hongkong better.\\" ===Changes in membership=== By July, two founders, engineering Samuel Wong and appointed member Vincent Cheng left the group. In October, Professor Felice Lieh Mak quit the group and she was appointed to the Executive Council. On 7 October 1992, all four CRC members in the Executive Council, Rita Fan and Allen Lee, Selina Chow and Edward Ho were dumped from the Council by governor Chris Patten as the governor wanted devoid of party politics. Rita Fan quit Executive and Legislative Councils as well as the CRC on the same day. ===Transforming into Liberal Party=== In mid 1992, the CRC set up a working group to look at forming a political party with other like-minded organisations. The CRC had courted groups such as the Business and Professionals Federation of Hong Kong consisting of about 150 members, mostly highly successful businessmen or companies, the Liberal Democratic Federation of Hong Kong with about 150 members and the rural powerbrokers in the Heung Yee Kuk consisting of 155 members representing about 300,000 indigenous New Territories residents. The CRC ceased to function in March 1993 after an 18-month lifespan and some 14 CRC legislators joined the Liberal Party officially formed on 6 June 1993. ==List of members== Convenor * Allen Lee Peng-fei Legislative Councillors: * Allen Lee * Stephen Cheong * Selina Chow * Rita Fan * Ngai Shiu-kit * Lau Wong-fat * Edward Ho * Ronald Joseph Arculli * Peggy Lam * Miriam Lau * Lau Wah-sum * Samuel Wong * Vincent Cheng * Peter Wong * Moses Cheng * Lam Kui-chun * Gilbert Leung * Steven Poon * Felice Lieh Mak * Henry Tang * Howard Young Regional Councillors: * Gilbert Leung * Lau Wong-fat District Board members: * Peggy Lam (Wan Chai) * Lau Wong-fat (Tuen Mun) Heung Yee Kuk: * Lau Wong-fat ==References== Category:1991 establishments in Hong Kong Category:1993 disestablishments in Hong Kong Category:Defunct political parties in Hong Kong Category:Political parties disestablished in 1993 Category:Political parties established in 1991 ","title":"Co-operative Resources Centre"},{"id":"19309616","text":"Dance Parade is non-profit organization that promotes dance as an expressive and unifying art form by showcasing all forms of dance.

Phillips was most recently with the Sheffield Steelers of the British Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL). ==Playing career== Phillips began his career within the Kingston upon Hull club in England, playing for Kingston Crunch under-16, Kingston Predators under-19 and then Kingston Jets of the English National League in November 2003. He then moved up to the Hull Stingrays in the British National League, a team which joined the Elite League in 2006. Phillips established himself as one of Britain's top defencemen and served as assistant captain of the Stingrays in the 2007‚Äì08 season. He moved to the Belfast Giants for the 2008‚Äì09 season, becoming new coach Steve Thornton's first signing. Establishing a career high 25 points in 54 games, Phillips helped the Giants to be crowned Champions of the Challenge Cup and Knockout Cup. On 28 April 2009, Phillips re-signed to remain with the Giants for the following season. However, with NHL ambitions, and following an impressive performance in a Chicago Blackhawks evaluation camp, Phillips was signed to a two-way contract with American Hockey League affiliate team, the Rockford IceHogs on 12 July 2009. He participated on an invitation in the Blackhawks training camp, before returning to the IceHogs to begin the 2009‚Äì10 season. After making his North American debut against the Peoria Rivermen on 4 October 2009, Phillips was briefly loaned to ECHL team Toledo Walleye, scoring his first North American professional goal, before he was recalled to the IceHogs to remain for the majority of the season posting 6 assists in 52 games. On 8 April 2010, it was confirmed that Phillips had agreed to a one- year deal with fellow AHL team, the Chicago Wolves for the 2010‚Äì11 season. Phillips was then assigned to the Walleye of the ECHL to begin the 2010 season. After appearing in one game with the Wolves in November he was returned to Toledo. With only five points in 31 games with the Walleye, on 12 November, Phillips was reassigned by the Wolves to fellow ECHL team, the Gwinnett Gladiators. On 25 December, Dave was released from his contract with the Wolves and shortly joined fellow AHL team, the Lake Erie Monsters, on a professional try out on 5 January 2011. After posting three assists in 10 games with the Monsters, Phillips returned to the Gladiators. Towards the end of his first stint with the Monsters, Phillips signed with Australian-based team, the Adelaide Adrenaline, for the forthcoming 2011 season on 12 January 2011. On 10 May 2011, it was announced that Phillips would be returning to Britain and the Elite Ice Hockey League with the Coventry Blaze. After the Hull Stingrays announced they would not take part in the 2015‚Äì16 season, who Phillips was to play for, it was made public that the newly reformed Manchester Storm along with Matty Davies would sign both players for the coming season. In 2016, Phillips signed with the Sheffield Steelers, remaining with the team until 2020.

It was first opened to the public in 1984. Since HCSNA is designated a \\"Natural Area\\" rather than a \\"State Park\\", the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department's first priority is the maintenance and preservation of the property's natural state. Accordingly, facilities are purposely somewhat primitive and recreational activities may be curtailed if the TPWD deems it necessary to protect the environment. ==Location== Hill Country State Natural Area is located on the border of Bandera County and Medina County, approximately 10 miles (16 km) southwest of Bandera, Texas, 20 miles (32 km) north of Hondo, Texas, and 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of San Antonio, Texas. Address: 10600 Bandera Creek Road, Bandera, TX 78003 ==Geography and Geology== Set in the scenic hills and canyons typical of the Texas Hill Country, the preserve lies about ten miles north of the Balcones escarpment and within the Balcones Fault Zone. The elevation ranges from approximately . The local Woodard Cave Fault runs through the property on a general east-west line. The terrain of the area consists of eroded limestone hills and mesas, typical landforms of the Hill Country. There are also relatively flat bottomland areas surrounding the small creeks that drain the property. The local bedrock is exposed throughout much of the preserve. The highest hilltops, and the lower hills in the southern part of the Natural Area, are capped by fairly resistant limestone of the Fort Terret formation within the Edwards Group, which is the dominant bedrock of the Edwards Plateau to the north. The rest of the preserve lies atop the softer, more easily eroded Upper Glen Rose Formation, also a limestone. ==Flora and fauna== The Natural Area supports eight recognized plant community types and over 450 plant species. The majority of the preserve is covered by Texas live oak (Quercus fusiformis) and Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei)...commonly called \\"mountain cedar\\"... woodlands, live oak savannah, Texas red oak (Quercus buckleyi) woodlands, and open grasslands composed primarily of sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula) and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Smaller communities include stands of Lacey oak (Quercus laceyi), pecan (Carya illinoinensis)-sugarberry (Celtis laevigata) groves, and gramagrass-switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) grasslands, as well as fields of sotol (Dasylirion wheeleri). The natural vegetation of the property, like much of the Texas Hill Country, has suffered from overgrazing and the introduction of invasive species like exotic King Ranch bluestem (Bothriochloa ischaemum var. songarica). HCSNA affords good opportunities for bird watching. Over 160 species of birds have been sighted in the preserve, including two bird species classified as endangered: the golden-cheeked warbler (Dendroica chrysoparia) and the black-capped vireo (Vireo atricapilla).Lockwood, Mark. April 1995. ‚ÄúBirds of Hill Country State Natural Area: a Field Checklist. Natural Resources Program, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, Austin, Texas. As in much of the Hill Country, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are by far the most common large mammal on the property. Wild turkeys, armadillos, skunks, raccoons, opossums, cottontail rabbits, jack rabbits, and fox squirrels are also present. Feral pigs, exotic fallow and axis deer, porcupines, rock squirrels, and ringtailed cats can occasionally be encountered. Bobcats, coyotes, both red and grey foxes, and rarely, mountain lions, inhabit the area, but are seldom seen by visitors. ==History== The land within the preserve has been inhabited for several thousand years, and a number of Native American artifacts have been found on the property, including human remains. After the arrival of European settlers in the mid-1800s, the area became part of a working ranch. The bottomlands were converted to cropland and the remainder was used for grazing. Eventually becoming the Bar-O Ranch, several parcels of land were subsequently donated by Louise Merrick between 1976 and 1982 to establish the Hill Country State Natural Area. Ms. Merrick stipulated that the property was ‚Äúto be kept far removed and untouched by modern civilization, where everything is preserved intact, yet put to a useful purpose.‚Äù The preserve was opened to the public in 1984 with . In 1986 a further were acquired, bringing the total size to the current . ==Recreation== HCSNA has over of multi-use trails and permits hiking, biking and horseback riding. Equestrian facilities are available (see the TPWD - Hill Country State Natural Area website in the External links below for more details). Several dude ranches adjoin the property and regularly lead hikes and trail rides through the Natural Area. The picturesque, but intermittent, West Verde Creek runs through the preserve, allowing for swimming and fishing when water levels are high enough. For herd management purposes, TPWD conducts controlled deer hunting by a limited number of hunters during a few weekends each season. HCSNA also hosts the annual Bandera 100 km ultramarathon run in January , TejasTrails.com. HCSNA urges all visitors to respect the Leave No Trace set of wilderness ethics: 1) Plan Ahead and Prepare, 2) Travel on Marked Trails Only, 3) Always Dispose of Waste Properly, 4) Leave Behind What You Find, 5) Never Build An Open Fire, 6) Respect Wildlife, and 7) Be Considerate of Other Visitors. ==Camping== Consistent with its designation as a natural area, the site is deliberately left largely undeveloped and natural, relative to a typical state park. Camping is limited to nine walk-in campsites, three small hike-in camping areas, and five equestrian campsites with horse pens. The campsites and camping areas lack sewer, electric, and potable water hookups. There is a group lodge with electric hookups, but it also lacks potable water. ==Nearby Parks== *Garner State Park *Lost Maples State Natural Area *Government Canyon State Natural Area *Guadalupe River State Park and adjacent Honey Creek State Natural Area ==References *Texas Parks and Wildlife ‚Äì Hill Country State Natural Area *Hill Country State Natural Area Partners (local non-profit group) *Texas Parks and Wildlife: www.youtube.com Category:State parks of Texas Category:Protected areas of Bandera County, Texas Category:Protected areas of Medina County, Texas Category:1984 establishments in Texas ","title":"Hill Country State Natural Area"},{"id":"19309718","text":"The Python is a D.P.V.

As the name suggests, it represents a neoplastic process of germ cells that is confined to the spermatogonial niche. The term GCNIS was introduced with the 2016 edition of the WHO classification of urological tumours. GCNIS more accurate describes the lesion as it arises between the basement membrane and Sertoli cells (the cells that 'nurse' the developing germ cell). The common, unspecified variant of the entity was once considered to be a carcinoma in situ, although the term \\"carcinoma in situ\\" is now largely historical as it is not an accurate description of the process.Mills, S (ed.) 2009.Sternberg's Diagnostic Pathology. 5th Edition. ==Classification== The World Health Organization classification of testicular tumoursEble J.N., Sauter G., Epstein J.I., Sesterhenn I.A. (Eds.): World Health Organization Classification of Tumours. Pathology and Genetics of Tumours of the Urinary System and Male Genital Organs. IARC Press: Lyon 2004. subdivides ITGCN into (1) a more common, unspecified type (ITGCNU), and (2) other specific subtypes. The most common specific subtypes are intratubular embryonal carcinoma and intratubular seminoma. ==Cancer risk== GCNIS is seen in the following settings: * Almost all invasive germ cell tumours of the testis in adults * Fifty percent of patients with GCNIS developed invasive germ cell tumours within five years of initial diagnosis. *Five percent of contralateral testes in men with a history of prior testicular germ cell tumour. *Less than five percent of cryptorchid testes. *Less than one percent of patients with infertility. ==Germ cell tumors that do not arise from ITGCNU== Not all germ cell tumors (GCTs) arise from intratubular germ cell neoplasia. The following testicular GCTs do not arise from ITGCN: *Spermatocytic tumor *Pediatric Yolk sac tumors (endodermal sinus tumour). This is currently an area of controversy as some authors dispute the absence of ITGCN in these cases. *Teratoma (rare exceptions) ==Diagnosis== GCNIS is not palpable, and not visible on macroscopic examination of testicular tissue. Microscopic examination of affected testicular tissue most commonly shows germ cells with enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei with prominent nucleoli and clear cytoplasm. These cells are typically arranged along the basement membrane of the tubule, and mitotic figures are frequently seen. The sertoli cells are pushed toward the lumen by the neoplastic germ cells, and spermatogenesis is almost always absent in the affected tubules. Pagetoid spread of GCNIS into the rete testis is common. Immunostaining with placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) highlights GCNIS cell membranes in 95 percent of cases. OCT3/4 is a sensitive and specific nuclear stain of GCNIS. ==Treatment== GCNIS is generally treated by radiation therapy and/or orchiectomy. Chemotherapy used for metastatic germ cell tumours may also eradicate GCNIS. ==See also== *Carcinoma in situ *Germ cell tumor ==Additional images== Image:Intratubular germ cell neoplasia high mag.jpgITGCN.

She appears in and does voice-overs for many commercials, and has roles ranging from minor to starring in both film and television. Savoy appears on the Breaking Bad fan site as lawyer Perry Trivedi in the award-winning prequel series, Better Call Saul. == Early life == Suzanne H√©l√®ne Savoy was born in Wilmington, Delaware, the daughter of Jean Dawson Savoy and Prew Savoy. The family relocated to the town of Iberville in the province of Qu√©bec, Canada, when she was five years old. She and her sister Jeanette (\\"Jeanie\\") were weekly boarders at the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Montreal while their younger sister Alexis remained in Iberville to be schooled in French. Summer vacations and holidays were spent at the shore in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with their maternal grandparents, Ella and Ralph Dawson. Savoy attended CEGEP at Sir George Williams University, since renamed Concordia University. == Design Work == A graduate of National Theatre School of Canada's Design Program, her set design for Goldoni's The Boors was selected by the head of the program, designer Fran√ßois Barbeau, to be displayed at the 1975 Prague Quadrennial of Performance Design and Space. Savoy has designed and/or built costumes and puppets for various theaters in Canada and the United States, including the Groupe Nouvel'Aire in Montreal, Persephone Theatre in Saskatoon, Gryphon Theatre in Ontario, and NYC's The Shakespeare Project and Bloodstone Theatrical. == Performing career == Savoy began her acting career after moving to Houston in her late twenties. She studied at The Royal National Theatre of Great Britain and various other schools and colleges including the University of Houston as a guest of the Director of UH's School of Theatre, Dr. Sidney Berger. She quickly established herself as a full-time working actor in Texas through her voice-over and commercial work as well as supporting and starring roles in film, co-starring and principal roles on TV, and stage work at venues such as regional theaters The Dallas Theater Center and The Alley Theatre, at The Houston Shakespeare Festival, Stages Repertory Theatre and Main Street Theatre in Houston. In 1986 she co-founded Mercury Studio, which provided on- camera training for Houston actors until 2005. Having moved to New York City in 1995 with her daughter following divorce, Suzanne became a mainstay of Scott Cargle's The Shakespeare Project, which toured NYC's parks and public spaces. She variously performed, designed sets and costumes, built puppets, and created and ran TSP's education division over a period of nine years. In 2005, Suzanne moved to Harlem and continued her work appearing in and doing voice-overs in numerous national commercials. She has performed on a number of New York stages; Metropolitan Playhouse's production of Sinclair Lewis' Dodsworth, in which she appeared as Edith Cortright, received an Aggie Award for Best Ensemble. After a hiatus from film and TV while raising her daughter, she resumed work in those media. In 2013, Savoy was cast as DNC Chairwoman Patti Whittaker in the first season of the Netflix series House of Cards. Two days after she wrapped, she began receiving chemotherapy and radiation treatments for stage four colorectal cancer. Given a clean bill of health less than a year later, she was cast as matriarch Victoria Robertson in Steven Soderbergh's The Knick, which shot for two seasons. Savoy subsequently appeared in Seasons 4 and 5 of House of Cards. While her home base is in Harlem, she also spends time in Los Angeles for work and visiting her daughter, who now resides in LA and works as a screenwriter and director. === Comedy and Improv === Savoy studied at NYC's Upright Citizen's Brigade and went on to co-found indy teams Lascivious Jones, Tonya, and Wasp. Actress and comedian Nicole Byer was a teammate and co-founder of Lascivious Jones. Savoy appeared in TV roles for The Onion and UCB Comedy Shorts, and has worked repeatedly in sketches on Last Week Tonight With John Oliver. === One-Woman Show === Je Christine is a 75-minute live presentation of the life and works of France's first professional author, Christine de Pizan. Savoy translated de Pizan's works from 14th/15th-Century French manuscripts and created and performs the piece at universities, libraries, museums, and other non- traditional venues.

Hau Nui (MƒÅori for \\"big wind\\") was the first wind farm built in New Zealand. The wind farm was built in two stages and the completed capacity is 8.65 MW. ==Site== Hau Nui wind farm is located on a ridge adjacent to White Rock Road, the main road between Martinborough and White Rock. Stage 1 is situated on Range Road near its intersection with White Rock Road. Stage 2 is located approximately one kilometre south of Stage 1 on Range Road. The site has an average wind speed of . ==Turbines== Hau Nui has a total of fifteen Enercon E-40 wind turbines. The seven Stage 1 turbines are third-generation turbines, delivering 550 kW each. The eight Stage 2 turbines are later versions of the same Enercon E-40 model, each generating 600 kW each. The turbines in both stages are tall to the hub, and have rotor diameters of . ==Transmission== Electricity generated by Hau Nui is injected into the local distribution grid. The 400 V electricity generated by each turbine is stepped up by transformers at the base of the turbine - to 11,000 V for stage 1 turbines and 33,000 V for stage 2 turbines. 33 kV lines from stage 2 take electricity to Martinborough to supply the town. Stage 1 turbines connect to 11 kV lines to supply the local area, or connect to the Stage 2 to Martinborough 33 kV lines through a 750 kVA transformer to the north side of the stage. During peak demand, electricity generated by Hau Nui is used by Martinborough and the eastern South Wairarapa district. During off-peak, Hau Nui electricity can supply the entire South Wairarapa district via 33 kV lines connecting Martinborough with Featherston, Greytown, and Pirinoa. If local demand is low, some electricity may be exported to the national grid through Transpower's Greytown substation. ==See also== *Wind power in New Zealand ==References External links == * Category:Wind farms in New Zealand Category:Buildings and structures in the Wairarapa ","title":"Hau Nui Wind Farm"},{"id":"19309799","text":"Charles George Gass, MC (18 April 1898 ‚Äì March 1977) was the highest scoring observer ace during the First World War, with a total of 39 victories (16 solo) scored serving as a gunner flying with various pilots. After working in the Post Office between the wars, he was recalled to the Royal Air Force in early 1940. ==Early life and First World War== Gass was born in Chelsea, London, on 18 April 1898. He originally joined the 2/24th Battalion, London Regiment, of the Territorial Force and became a sergeant, the rank he held when he first entered a theatre of war on 25 June 1916. Copies of these medal cards are also available from ancestry.com (subscription required), only these copies show the additional details on the reverse of the card. He was then commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 17th Battalion, London Regiment, and was attached to the Royal Flying Corps from 1917. On 26 March 1918, he was assigned to No. 22 Squadron as an observer on Bristol F.2bs, flying in France. The two-seater \\"Brisfit\\" had a maximum speed of 123 mph, which made it as fast as or faster than most enemy fighters, and was manoeuvrable to boot. It had a forward-pointing Vickers machine gun for the pilot, and one or two Lewis machine guns that could be slid around on their Scarff ring mount by the observer/gunner to cover a wide field of fire. ===Aerial victories=== Gass soon showed his proficiency with the Lewis guns. He began by driving an Albatros D.V down out of control on 22 April 1918. Then he began one of the most spectacular months in First World War aerial warfare. On 7 May, Gass was gunner on a Bristol piloted by ace Alfred Atkey; Gass was in Atkey's plane by Atkey's request. They flew one of two Brisfits that took on 20 German scouts. Gass and Atkey destroyed five of the attackers, sending two of them down in burning meteors of falling wreckage. Gass claimed another German on 8 May while teamed with John Everard Gurdon. Then on the 9th, he and Atkey repeated themselves. Once again they flamed two Germans; additionally, they destroyed another German and drove two down out of the battle. They then reeled off a series of multiple victory days. Two on the 15th; three on the 19th; three more on the 20th; two each on the 22nd, 30th, and 31st; three on the 27th. Gass had scored 28 times in the month, all but one in conjunction with Atkey. No one in the First World War scored more victories in a single month. He officially transferred to the nascent Royal Air Force on 22 May 1918. Gass and Atkey scored another double on 2 June, which were Atkey's final victories. Then Gass was teamed with Lieutenant Edwin Bromley, and scored twice on the 5th. On 26 July, he shot down another German while teamed with Lieutenant Samuel Thompson. In August, Gass was teamed with Lieutenant John Everard Gurdon, who had been the pilot of the other Brisfit on 7 May. They tallied five wins together, with the last coming on 13 August. Gass was transferred for pilot training soon after, but the war ended before he qualified for his wings. Gass's final tally totalled 39. Broken down, they amounted to 5 destroyed in flames, including one victory which was shared with other planes; 12 others destroyed; 22 down \\"out of control\\". It was the sort of performance that had garnered multiple decorations for single-seat fighter pilots. For Gass, it brought a Military Cross gazetted on 16 September 1918, the citation read: Gass received his MC from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 16 November 1918. ==Interwar period== Gass ceased to be actively employed by the RAF on 11 April 1919, and relinquished his Territorial commission in 17th Battalion, London Regiment on 30 September 1921. He lived in South London after the war, the address given for despatch of his campaign medals was 95 Flood Street, Chelsea. He married Geraldine Marie Insani in the Fulham registration district in the second quarter of 1921. He joined the civil service as a Post Office clerk on 27 June 1922. He joined the Reserve of Air Force Officers as a pilot officer on 30 March 1925, and was promoted flying officer on 6 May. He left the reserve on 30 September 1928. His wife petitioned for divorce in 1934. They had had two sons, Geoffrey in 1922 and Donald in 1924. ==Second World War and after== With the Second World War escalating, Gass was recommissioned as a pilot officer in the Administrative and Special Duties Branch, RAF Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR), on 8 January 1940. He was promoted war substantive flying officer on 7 September, and confirmed in that rank on 8 January 1941. He was later promoted flight lieutenant and, on 1 January 1944, temporary squadron leader. He remarried, to Kathleen Fitzgerald, in the first quarter of 1944. He retired from the RAFVR on 10 August 1954, retaining the rank of squadron leader. ==NotesReferences== * Bristol F2 Fighter Aces of World War I. Jon Guttman, Harry Dempsey.

His birth was not recorded, but years later, on 30 June 1618, his older brother Jacob's legal action indicated that Balthasar was around 25 years old at the time, making his birth date 1593 or 1594. His father, Hans, was a widower, and when he died in 1609, Balthasar moved in with his older sister, Maria, and his brother-in-law, the prominent Dutch painter Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder (1573‚Äì1621), whom Maria married in 1604. Van der Ast was trained by Bosschaert as a still life painter, and his early works clearly show Bosschaert's influence.Balthasar van der Ast in the RKD In turn, the three sons of Ambrosius Bosschaert, Ambrosius the Younger (1609‚Äì1645), Johannes (ca. 1612/13-1628 or later), and Abraham (1606-1683/84) were trained by van der Ast upon the death of their father. Together, this group of painters is sometimes referred to as the ‚ÄúBosschaert dynasty‚Äù. Van der Ast accompanied the Bosschaert family in their move in 1615 to Bergen op Zoom and in 1619 to Utrecht, where van der Ast entered the Utrecht Guild of St. Luke. Roelandt Savery (1576‚Äì1639) entered the St. Luke's guild in Utrecht at about the same time. Savery, had considerable influence on van der Ast and his pupils in the years to come, especially in van der Ast's interest in tonality. Besides the Bosschaerts, his pupils were Anthony Claesz and Johannes Baers. It is also likely that Jan Davidsz de Heem (1606-1683/84) was van der Ast's pupil in Utrecht. He also influenced Willem and Evert van Aelst, and Bartholomeus Assteyn. Van der Ast remained in Utrecht until 1632, when he moved to Delft where he joined the guild of St Luke on 22 June 1633. In February 1633 he married Margrieta Jans van Buijeren. They had two children, Maria and Helena. In Delft, van der Ast and family lived in the house on Cellebroerstraat until 1640, and in the house in Oude Delft until his death in 1657, when he was buried in the Oude Kerk. ==Selected works== Image:Basket- fruits-1622.jpgBasket of Fruits, c. 1622, National Gallery of Art File:Basket-flowers-1622.jpgBasket with flowers Fruit still life with shells.jpgFruit still life with shells, 1620 File:Bartholomeus van der Ast still life with shells.jpgStill life with shells ==References * *Works and literature at PubHist *Vermeer and The Delft School, a full text exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, which contains material on Balthasar van der Ast Category:1593 births Category:1657 deaths Category:Dutch Golden Age painters Category:Dutch male painters Category:People from Middelburg Category:Dutch still life painters Category:Members of the Utrecht Guild of Saint Luke Category:Members of the Delft Guild of Saint Luke Category:Flower artists ","title":"Balthasar van der Ast"},{"id":"19309891","text":"Bibi Gaytan is the first album by Mexican pop singer Bibi Gayt√°n.

Within the site there is evidence for all phases of mining activity; from the Bronze Age, through the medieval period, to its revival in the 18th century and the peak of activity with a subsequent decline in the late 19th and the early 20th century. It has been designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.Cwmystwyth Lead Mine The site also features prominently in the Upland Ceredigion Landscape of Historic Interest. ==History== Silver, lead and zinc have been mined in the valley of the River Ystwyth since Roman times, an activity that reached its peak in the 18th century. The largest of the very many mines was Cwmystwyth Mine. It is reputed that the average age at death of the miners in Cwmystwyth was 32, largely because of acute lead poisoning. There is no longer any active metal mining in the Ystwyth valley. ==Water use== Water was extensively used during the silver and lead mining process to extract the ore. In the case of Cwm Ystwyth mine, much of the water was brought in by contour hugging leats from several miles upstream. The channel of the leat can still be followed on the hillside and is clearly visible from the road on the opposite side of the valley. Much of the water was used for hushing, prospecting and working the ore in the open. ==Banc Ty'ndd√¥l sun-disc== In October 2002 the Banc Ty'ndd√¥l sun-disc was discovered on the mining site. The disc is over 4,000 years old, which makes it the earliest gold artifact discovered in Wales. == Environmental Impacts == A survey of the River Ystwyth in 1919 showed that due to mining activity in the area, the fauna was restricted to 9 species, which consisted mostly of insects. The lead concentration in the river was found to be 0.4 mg/L. In 1922 another survey was conducted; the number of species had increased to 26, with the lead concentration decreasing to below 0.1 mg/L. The number of species increased to 63 by 1939, but there were still no fish present in the river. The lead concentration fell to below 0.05 mg/L. Fish had returned to most of the river by 1975. However, there were no fish within a 3 km stretch below the Cwm Ystwyth mine. ==Gallery== Image:Main building of Cwm Ystwyth lead mine- by-Rudi-Winter.jpgMain building of Cwmystwyth lead mine Image:Graig y Ddalfa at Cwmystwyth lead mines-by-Rudi-Winter.jpgGraig y Ddalfa at Cwmystwyth lead mines Image:Craig-y-Ddolfa-by-Phil-Berry.jpgOld mine workings below Craig-y- Ddolfa, east of Cwmystwyth Image:Cwmystwyth Mine m01.jpgAbandoned building, old lead mine, Cwmystwyth.

Upon completion in September 1890, she was delivered to the German company Dampfschiff Rederei Hansa of Hamburg, and was registered under the name SS Stubbenhuk. She was subsequently acquired by the Hamburg America Line of Germany, where she sailed as the SS Sicilia from 1894. She was acquired by the Shinyei Kisen Goshi Kaisha company in 1913. The company was owned by four or five individuals who possessed one other ship. She was renamed the Komagata Maru.Johnston, p. 27. Inspector Reid, H.H.

To accommodate the passengers, the lower deck was cleaned and fitted with latrines and wooden benches.

The first variant of the 2 Series slated for production was the Aptera 2e (formerly Typ-1e), a battery electric vehicle announced in late 2008. The 2e accelerates from 0-100 km/h in 6.3 seconds and has a top speed of top speed of 150 km/h. A later variant would have been Aptera 2h (formerly Typ-1h), a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. According to Aptera, the 2 Series is priced from the ¬£16,000 to ¬£32,000. An Aptera 2 made a short appearance in the 2009 film Star Trek. The company opened a pre-ordering process for residents of California, but stopped taking deposits in July 2011. On 12 August 2011, Aptera announced it would return all deposits from customers who had signed up to buy a car. In 2019, Aptera Motors was re-formed under the leadership of the original founders, Chris Anthony and Steve Fambro, and began developing a much revised solar- powered EV, the Aptera 3, with a 1,600 km range. ==Design and fuel consumption== The Aptera 2 Series was designed to be a low-energy vehicle; early estimates of its energy consumption ran as low as 80 watt-hours/mi at 55 mph. Later estimates are as high as 200 Wh for aggressive driving. The company stated in September 2009 that \\"if Aptera was given an official EPA rating [the fuel-efficiency figure assigned to all cars by the United States federal government], it would be 851 mpg\\", suggesting that it is 2.2 times more efficient than Nissan Leaf. The Aptera 2 Series has a , compared with for the record-holding General Motors EV1, and for the 2010 Mercedes-Benz E-Class Coup√©, currently the lowest for a mass-produced car. The Aptera's atypical shape is a result of extensive optimization in a virtual wind tunnel, following the designs of Alberto Morelli. It used recessed windshield wipers and low rolling resistance tires. The first prototype attained a by making use of an \\"Eyes-Forward\\" rear-view camera system instead of side-view mirrors, which create a large amount of drag. A September 2008 Aptera newsletter showed a rendering of the car featuring a conventional driver-side mirror and no driver-side rear-view camera. Aptera CTO Steve Fambro stated that the system was simplified to make use of a single camera mounted near the top of the vehicle. The body design was similar to Pegasus Research Company's human- powered \\"Fusion\\" vehicle (1983) and the MIT Aztec, but the direct inspiration was the Volkswagen 1-litre car. The Aptera 2 Series was a three-wheeled vehicle with front-wheel drive. On March 23, 2010, Aptera announced their use of BorgWarner's 31-03 eGearDrive transmission for the 2e drive train. An April 14, 2010 press release announced further suppliers: A123 Systems for the 20 kWh lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) battery pack, and Remy International for the 82 kW HVH250 electric motor. The freeway range was promised to be around with two passengers and some luggage. They planned to offer an SAE J1772 compatible charging system, at either 110 or 220 V. ===Plug-in series hybrid=== An early Aptera 2h design used a \\"small, water-cooled EFI gasoline engine with closed loop oxygen feedback and catalytic converter,\\" coupled with a 12 kW generator/starter. With a tank capacity of \\"up to five gallons,\\" the Aptera 2h would have a claimed range of , compared to the range of the Aptera 2e. The 2h would have been a series hybrid: The engine would not be connected to the drivetrain, instead being used to recharge the batteries. As with any plug-in hybrid, fuel economy of the Aptera 2h would depend on trip length and battery charge. For trips of less than about after a full charge the engine may not turn on at all, resulting in approximately the same energy consumption as the pure electric model 96 watt-hours/mile. If on the other hand, the car were never plugged in, the Aptera 2h would get . Aptera Motors quoted , which applies to a trip after a full charge. They justified this by stating that 99% of Americans drive less than daily. ==Safety== Because the Aptera 2 Series had only three wheels, most American states classify the vehicle as a motorcycle. This means that safety and emissions tests are not mandatory, as they are for cars. Despite this, Aptera Motors emphasized that safety had a high priority in the vehicle's design. Aptera Motors performed simulated crash tests using Abaqus FEM software, crush testing on structural components, and was planning real-world crash tests before production. The Aptera 2e featured a Formula One-inspired passenger safety cell and boxed sandwich foam core composite structures. Frontal crumple distance was 1,150 mm, large for a vehicle of its size. As the body is above most cars' bumpers, a colliding vehicle's bumper would travel under the body, deflecting the energy. Despite its height, the placement of the heavy batteries lowered the centre of mass of the Aptera 2 Series, a design similar to the highly stable Commuter Cars Tango. Driver and passenger airbag-in-seatbelts were also provided. ==Accessories and interior== The design intent model, revealed on 14 April 2010, seated two adults, had power windows, cup holders, and 0.64 m3 of boot volume. It used LED running and interior lights to reduce power consumption. An optional solar panel mounted on the roof runs the heat pump during the day. This keeps the interior comfortable and reduces the size of the heat pump needed. The seats can be heated or cooled by forced air, both for comfort and efficiency reasons. The only comfort downside is that the suspension was described as \\"hard\\". Radio, CD/DVD/MP3 player, and GPS navigation were integrated into an in-console touch screen carputer, based on Moblin by Wind River Systems, but the climate control used physical dials. It also had RFID-based keyless ignition and entry and scarab doors. To reduce the ecological footprint of construction, EcoSpun recycled materials and organic dyes were to be used for the seats and flooring, and the dashboard and the door panels were free of heavy metals and plasticizers. Aptera also planned to have leatherette and leather seats as options. ==See also== * Plug-in electric vehicle * Aurel Persu designer of teardrop aerodynamic car in 1922 * List of motorized trikes ==References Category:Electric concept cars Category:Electric motorcycles Category:Battery electric vehicles Category:Plug-in hybrid vehicles Category:Hybrid electric vehicles Category:Three-wheeled motor vehicles Category:Proposed electric car models ","title":"Aptera 2 Series"},{"id":"19310129","text":"In graph theory, a star Sk is the complete bipartite graph K1,k: a tree with one internal node and k leaves (but no internal nodes and k + 1 leaves when k ‚â§ 1). Alternatively, some authors define Sk to be the tree of order k with maximum diameter 2; in which case a star of k > 2 has k ‚àí 1 leaves. A star with 3 edges is called a claw. The star Sk is edge-graceful when k is even and not when k is odd. It is an edge-transitive matchstick graph, and has diameter 2 (when k > 1), girth ‚àû (it has no cycles), chromatic index k, and chromatic number 2 (when k > 0). Additionally, the star has large automorphism group, namely, the symmetric group on k letters. Stars may also be described as the only connected graphs in which at most one vertex has degree greater than one. ==Relation to other graph families== Claws are notable in the definition of claw-free graphs, graphs that do not have any claw as an induced subgraph... They are also one of the exceptional cases of the Whitney graph isomorphism theorem: in general, graphs with isomorphic line graphs are themselves isomorphic, with the exception of the claw and the triangle K3.. A star is a special kind of tree. As with any tree, stars may be encoded by a Pr√ºfer sequence; the Pr√ºfer sequence for a star K1,k consists of k ‚àí 1 copies of the center vertex. Several graph invariants are defined in terms of stars. Star arboricity is the minimum number of forests that a graph can be partitioned into such that each tree in each forest is a star, and the star chromatic number of a graph is the minimum number of colors needed to color its vertices in such a way that every two color classes together form a subgraph in which all connected components are stars.. The graphs of branchwidth 1 are exactly the graphs in which each connected component is a star.. The star graphs S3, S4, S5 and S6. ==Other applications== The set of distances between the vertices of a claw provides an example of a finite metric space that cannot be embedded isometrically into a Euclidean space of any dimension. The star network, a computer network modeled after the star graph, is important in distributed computing. A geometric realization of the star graph, formed by identifying the edges with intervals of some fixed length, is used as a local model of curves in tropical geometry. A tropical curve is defined to be a metric space that is locally isomorphic to a star shaped metric graph. ==References== Category:Trees (graph theory) Category:Parametric families of graphs ","title":"Star (graph theory)"},{"id":"19310136","text":"Anton Strout (born January 24, 1970) is an American urban fantasy author.

He played for the Syracuse Orange men's basketball team from 2008 to 2012. He was selected in the second round of the 2012 NBA Draft by the Boston Celtics with the 51st pick overall. ==Early years== Joseph was born and raised in Montreal, Quebec, where he grew up in the working-class neighbourhood of Cote-des-Neiges north of downtown. Joseph first picked up a basketball in Grade 2 but was forced to shoot on garbage cans with his older brother Maurice. A court was eventually erected in Cote-des-Neiges and the brothers battled for hours. ==High school career== Joseph played in Maurice's shadow for a number of years as the older star gained prominence at noted Montreal-area prep school Champlain St. Lambert College. Kris struggled at first against elite competition, getting cut from his club team at the age of 14. He worked on his game, grew to 6-foot-6 and became a star for Sun Youth, a club-team powerhouse in the Montreal Basketball League. As a tenth-grader, he led the Quebec provincial team to a silver medal at the 2005 Canada Games. He played for his high school team at Mont-Royal high school, the Mount-Royal Mustangs. On a recommendation from youth coach Henry Wong, who thought Joseph needed an athletic and academic challenge, Joseph's mother agreed to let him leave Montreal in 2006 to complete two years of high school at Archbishop Carroll in Washington, D.C. As a senior, Joseph led Archbishop Carroll to a 26‚Äì11 record, including a 21-point, five rebound, three assist and three block effort in the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference (WCAC) Tournament in a 65‚Äì55 win over Our Lady of Good Counsel. Joseph was also invited to play in the Baltimore All-Stars vs. U.S. All-Stars Exhibition in April. That season, Joseph would go on to earn 2008 second team honors from the Washington Post.

He wrote several books based on his travels and natural history observations.Anon (1966) \\"Obituary: Major Richard William George Hingston, M.C.\\" The Geographical Journal 132(4):598 ==Early life== Hingston was the son of Rev. Richard Edward Hull Kingston (1859‚Äì1883), of Aglish, County Waterford, and Frances Sandiford. Most of his early life was spent in the family home at Horsehead in Passage West, County Cork. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and at University College Cork. He graduated from the National University of Ireland with first-class honours in 1910, and almost immediately obtained a position in the Indian Medical Service. He secured second place in the I.M.S. examination, among the eminent group which included T. A. Hughes, the physiologist, Clive Newcomb, the research chemist, and Henry Shortt, the parasitologist. In 1913, he was seconded from military duty as naturalist to the Indo-Russian Pamir triangulation expedition. In 1914 he went on war service and saw action in East Africa,France, Mesopotamia, and the N.W. Frontier, gaining two mentions in dispatches and the Military Cross for gallantry in action. ==Naturalist and author== In 1920 he published a book detailing his 1914 & 1916 travels in the Himalayan valley of Hazara, in what is now Pakistan, entitled A Naturalist in Himalaya. He was elected to the Royal Geographical Society on 22 June 1922, proposed by Lt.-Col. Williamson Oswald and seconded by John Scott Keltie. In 1924, he was appointed medical officer and naturalist to the Mount Everest Expedition, although he was not a mountaineer by profession but rather a doctor and naturalist. As a naturalist he collected 10,000 animal samples (insects for the largest part), and 500 plant specimens during the 1924 expedition. Among his finds were a species of spider he discovered living at 22,000 feet (later named as Euophrys omnisuperstes), the highest known habitat for any animal. There he also studied and later published his findings on the effects of high altitudes on the human body in Physiological Difficulties in the Ascent of Mount Everest, published in The Alpine Journal (1925). Despite his lack of official climbing skills, Hingston was able to come to the aid of Edward Norton at Camp IV when Norton was struck by snow blindness. From 1925 till 1927, he acted as surgeon- naturalist to the Marine Survey of India on H.I.M.S. Investigator. This post enabled him to conduct new and innovative research which provided rich fields of scientific treasure for several I.M.S. officers such as Alcock and Sewell. Hingston retired from the Indian Medical Service on pension in 1927. He immediately joined the Oxford University expedition to Greenland. In the following year he took command of an expedition sent by the same university to British Guiana. His account of the expedition was published in his book A naturalist in the Guiana forest in (1932). He subsequently undertook a mission to Rhodesia, Nyasaland, Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika to investigate the methods of preserving the indigenous fauna. He was recalled to military duty in India in 1939, and remained there until 1946. After the second world war, Hingston retired to his home in Passage West, County Cork. He wrote copiously, attractively, and accurately. Although most of his work appeared in scientific journals, he had a number of books to his credit. In A naturalist in the Himalaya (1920), he told of the spiders, ants, and butterflies of the high valleys; A naturalist in Hindustan (1923) detailed the lesser fauna of the plains of the United Provinces. Books on the Nature of the Deserts Edge, Problems of Instinct and Intelligence, and The Meaning of Animal Colour and Adornment appeared in the late '20s and early '30s. and his book on Darwin in 1934. He also contributed to Norton's 1924 book The Fight for Everest. Most of the specimens he collected are housed at The Natural History Museum in London. ==References * A Naturalist in the Himalaya (1920) (Scanned book) Category:1887 births Category:1966 deaths Category:20th-century Irish medical doctors Category:British entomologists Category:Coleopterists Category:Indian Medical Service officers Category:Fellows of the Royal Geographical Society Category:Indian Army personnel of World War I Category:Recipients of the Military Cross Category:20th-century zoologists ","title":"Richard Hingston"},{"id":"19310477","text":"The Philippines national basketball team may refer to: *Philippines men's national basketball team *Philippines women's national basketball team ","title":"Philippines national basketball team"},{"id":"19310486","text":"John Albert Laing (5 July 1884 ‚Äì 29 October 1944) was an Australian rules footballer who played with University in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

It is part of the Rodney District. Wellsford lies to the east. ==Early history== Early history of Maori tells how the western shores of Okahukura once extended to the entrance of the Kaipara Harbour as sand dunes with two channels into the harbour instead of one, as it is now. This portion of land that was more or less sand dunes was known as Tapora, and was inhabited by the Maori. Great storms gradually caused the sand dunes to drift away, allowing the sea to encroach, leaving only sand bars in the harbour where there was once a whare or large temple on the original sand dunes. For ten generations the land of Okahukura remained in the possession of Ngati Whatua. For more than ten years after the Government had purchased the neighbouring land known as Albertland, the peninsula was occupied by the Ngati Whatua tribe. About the year 1876 T. E. FitzGerald purchased the land from Ngati Whatua which included the Okahukura point and of land. FitzGerald built his first homestead around 1880 on a ridge overlooking Oruawharo River. Here he built a jetty for small boats for access when there was sufficient high tide, but there was a main landing point in deeper water for any tide. Due to the large number of kauri trees, FitzGerald leased the rights of this land to gum-diggers. Due to old age FitzGerald had to retire and terminate his twenty years of occupancy at Okahukura. Following FitzGerald's retirement A. H. Walker leased this land for two and a half years and dramatically improved the landscape by re-fencing and sowing grass. T.C. Williams now leased the land with W. Williams taking over management. For the next ten years Williams and his workers spent many days cutting and burning down bush to allow for sowing grasslands, while opening gumfields and a store at one of FitzGerald's old homes. In the year 1910 Williams was in the process of transferring the management of the block to C. Kemp, when he accidentally fatally shot himself. Kemp took over management of Okahukura, continuing with the development of boundary fences. Nearer the end of 1910 Okahukura was sold to Messrs Bowron and Smith of Christchurch. Kemp was still manager of the Okahukura property and split the property up, selling sections to others and developed roads for access into the new sections as well as communications through a telephone line. The land changed ownership numerous times between World War One and World War Two. ==Recent history== During World War Two the United States Marines set up camp on 'the run' (Sea View) and used the greater area for target practice. The New Zealand Government then took over Okahukura to use as a soldier rehabilitation settlement in April 1945. The name Okahukura was then changed to Tapora to avoid confusion with another Okahukura elsewhere in New Zealand. The Minister of 'Land and Returned Services' Association brokered a pact to develop the Okahukura peninsula for returned servicemen through ballots. A community to be called Tapora was planned with a shop, school, church and workers' houses (only the school and a few houses were constructed).Rural News, 19 February 2004. The ballots for the Returned Services' Association were created in 1947 and Tapora turned into a dairy farming settlement. Tapora is now a thriving community with productive dairy farms, a primary school, community hall and golf course.L, Johnston. (2006) The Story of Tapora, Wellsford, New Zealand.

Howard and is the first story written by Howard to feature his creation Kull, set in his fictional Thurian Age. It is effectively a prequel to the other Kull stories, detailing the events that led Kull to be exiled by his tribe, as well as foreshadowing Kull's future as a great king through the use of a prophetic dream. It also shows that Kull's rebelliousness against stifling old laws and traditions long antedated his becoming King of Valusia, and that he was very much an outsider even in his earlier life in Atlantis. This story would not be published until 1967, in the Lancer book, King Kull. ==Plot== Long before it became a great empire, the continent of Atlantis was populated by various tribes of barbarians. Three barbarians from the sea-mountain tribe ‚Äî Kull, Am-ra, and Gor-na ‚Äî camp for the night. Gor-na, the oldest, tells an ancient legend of a tiger who prayed to the moon for deliverance from pursuing hunters and was granted sanctuary, causing all tigers to worship the moon. Kull finds fault with Gor-na's story, pointing out that tigers wouldn't worship the moon for aiding a tiger who lived centuries ago. Gor-na rebukes Kull for his ridicule of old myths and traditions, insisting that what has always been will always be. Kull believes his statement to be false, stating how not even mountains last forever. Gor-na reminds Kull that he was rescued by the sea-mountain tribe from a feral existence after his family perished in a great flood, and that Kull must learn to accept the ways of his adopted people. Am-ra, the youngest of the group, comes to Kull's defense, saying that while Kull may be an outsider, he is clearly the strongest member of their tribe. Gor-na has to agree. Their conversation turns to the outside world. The neighboring islands of Lemuria are currently at war against the great kingdom of Valusia on the mainland. Kull gets excited, and says that he wishes to someday see Valusia, the City of Wonder. Gor-na says that if he ever does, it will be in chains. As the men lay down to sleep, Kull has an amazing dream. In it, he hears the sound of war and trumpets. He sees glorious vistas opening up before him. Kull finds himself wearing a golden crown, and hears voices shouting \\"King Kull! King Kull!\\" Kull awakens to find himself haunted and enthralled by the vision. The next morning, the men return to their village. They learn that a young girl named Ala is about to be burned at the stake. Ala dared to marry a Lemurian pirate, and was exiled for breaking the age-old feud. When the lovers' ship crashed and she washed ashore, Ala's people found her, and now intend to execute her - with her own mother disowning her while leading the vengeful mob. Kull finds himself bewildered and disgusted by the laws which insist an Atlantian must be put to death for marrying an enemy of their race. His eyes meet Ala's and they reach a silent understanding. Kull takes out his hunting knife and throws it at the girl's chest, killing her in an instant. Soon, Ala is spared from her fate of being burned alive. While the villagers are still too shocked to act, Kull turns away and flees. Am-ra saves Kull's life by causing an archer to miss his shot. Kull climbs up the side of a cliff, and escapes by jumping into the sea. ==External links== *Robert E.

The theory is attributed to French philosopher and writer Jean-Pierre Faye. Proponents of the theory point to a number of similarities between the far-left and the far- right, including their supposed propensity to gravitate to authoritarianism or totalitarianism. However, the horseshoe theory has also received some criticism. == Origin == The horseshoe metaphor was used as early as during the Weimar Republic to describe the ideology of the Black Front. Later use of the term in political theory is seen in Jean-Pierre Faye's 2002 book Le Si√®cle des id√©ologies. Others have attributed the theory as having come from the American sociologists Seymour Martin Lipset and Daniel Bell, as well as the Pluralist school. Because the theory is also popular in Germany, a co-contributor to this theory is said to be the German political scientist Eckhard Jesse. Mentioned critically in Die Zeit article Das Hufeisen muss runter == Modern usage == In a 2006 book, political scientist Jeff Taylor wrote: \\"It may be more useful to think of the Left and the Right as two components of populism, with elitism residing in the Center. The political spectrum may be linear, but it is not a straight line. It is shaped like a horseshoe.\\"Taylor, Jeff. 2006. Where Did the Party Go? University of Missouri Press. p. 118. In the same year, the term was used when discussing a resurgent hostility towards Jews and new antisemitism from both the far-left and the far-right. In a 2008 essay, Josef Joffe, a visiting fellow at the conservative think tank, Hoover Institution, wrote: > Will globalization survive the gloom? The creeping revolt against > globalization actually preceded the Crash of '08. Everywhere in the West, > populism began to show its angry face at mid-decade.

In 2015, reformist Muslim Maajid Nawaz invoked the horseshoe theory while lamenting a common tendency on the far-left and far-right towards the compiling and publishing of \\"lists of political foes,\\" adding: > As the political horseshoe theory attributed to Jean-Pierre Faye highlights, > if we travel far-left enough, we find the very same sneering, nasty and > reckless bully-boy tactics used by the far-right.

In a recent article for Eurozine titled \\"How Right is the Left?\\", Kyrylo Tkachenko wrote about the common cause found recently between the far-left and the far-right in Ukraine: == Criticism == The horseshoe theory has been criticized by those from both ends of the political spectrum who oppose being grouped with those they consider to be their polar opposites, while also being criticized as an oversimplification of political ideologies and ignorant of fundamental differences between them. Simon Choat, a senior lecturer in political theory at Kingston University, criticizes horseshoe theory from a leftist perspective. He argues that far-left and far-right ideologies only share similarities in the vaguest sense in that they both oppose the liberal democratic status quo; however, the two sides both have very different reasons and very different aims for doing so. Choat uses the issue of globalization as an example; both the far-left and the far-right attack neoliberal globalization and its elites, but have conflicting views on who those elites are and conflicting reasons for attacking them: Choat also argues that although proponents of the horseshoe theory may cite examples of alleged history of collusion between fascists and communists, those on the far-left usually oppose the rise of far-right or fascist regimes in their countries. Instead, he argues that it has been centrists who have supported far-right and fascist regimes that they prefer in power over socialist ones. == See also == * Argument to moderation * Centrism * Comparison of Nazism and Stalinism * Hemicycle * Inglehart‚ÄìWelzel cultural map of the world * Left‚Äìright political spectrum * Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact/Germany‚ÄìSoviet Union relations, 1918‚Äì1941 * National Bolshevism * Neutrality * Nolan Chart * Open‚Äìclosed political spectrum * Overton window * Political compass * Political spectrum * Strasserism == References  * Category:Dichotomies Category:Political science Category:Political spectrum Category:Political science terminology ","title":"Horseshoe theory"},{"id":"19310709","text":"TV Face is a pulpy, horror webseries directed by Dean Bull and produced by David Britz. 99 Potions and Paradox Opera are the production companies associated with creating the show.

Managed by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority (NFTA), which also uses the transit center as its headquarters, it operates as a major transportation hub for a number of NFTA Metro bus routes, as well as inter-city bus services. Its location is also of importance in that this terminal normally is the first or last stop in the United States on the busy Toronto-New York City bus corridor in the United States (the exceptions being a re-routed Buffalo to Toronto runs serving Buffalo Niagara International Airport on the way to the Rainbow Bridge, where it crosses into Ontario). The closest two Canadian bus stations (though not served by all trips) are Fort Erie (located at a Robomart gas station at Princess and Waterloo Streets) or the more frequently served Niagara Falls Transit Terminal at Bridge and Erie Streets in downtown Niagara Falls, Ontario. Built in 1977, the architectural firm of CannonDesign created a terminal that is a \\"pleasant and even exciting space to experience, with views of travelers, buses and the city beyond afforded by comparatively large areas of glazing\\". It replaced an older Greyhound Station, located at 672 Main Street, near Tupper. After the Main Street station had closed, it became a police station for the Buffalo Theater District and is currently used partially as the Alleyway Theatre.Red Jacket Street Guide to Buffalo and Niagara Falls (c. 1950's) ==Inside the terminal== Aside from the transportation center being the main offices for the NFTA and the Buffalo area base office for Greyhound Lines, Inc., there are a number of service based businesses for passengers and employees of the terminal. * A Tim Hortons coffee shop, which replaced Craig and Craig Twin Bakery and the previous NFTA Metro information kiosk in November 2013 * NFTA Transit Police sub-station * soda and other vending machines * taxi stand for Buffalo Taxi Service In the past, Hardee's and Burger King had an outlet in the terminal that was later turned into a \\"Travelers Caf√©,\\" both operated by Greyhound Lines. The space for the restaurant also had been converted into an indoor waiting area for passengers waiting for local bus service at the corner of North Division and Ellicott. It has since been closed. The NFTA presently uses the area for storage. Additionally, a gift shop existed for a number of years, but has been vacated and renovated into a larger office area for the NFTA Transit Police sub-station. ==Intercity bus lines serving the terminalGreyhound Bus Lines=== * Buffalo to Batavia, Rochester, Geneva, Ithaca, Binghamton, Scranton, New York City * Buffalo to Batavia, Rochester, Syracuse, Cortland, Binghamton, Scranton, New York City * Buffalo to Batavia, Rochester, Syracuse, Utica, Schenectady, Albany, Springfield, Worcester, Boston * Buffalo to Erie, Cleveland ===Greyhound Canada=== * Buffalo to Fort Erie, Niagara Falls, St. Catharines, Grimsby, Burlington, Toronto === Coach USA - ErieCoach USA - Erie provides scheduled bus service in Western New York between Jamestown, Olean, and Buffalo === * Buffalo to Lackawanna, Angola, Dunkirk, SUNY Fredonia, Fredonia (downtown), Cassadaga, Gerry, Jamestown * Buffalo to East Aurora, Holland, Machias, Arcade, Franklinville, Olean ===Megabus=== * Buffalo to Toronto (non-stop only) * Buffalo to Rochester, Syracuse and New York City (semi-express) * Buffalo to Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, DC * Buffalo to New York City (non-stop) ===Coach Canada-Trentway Wagar=== * Buffalo to Fort Erie, Niagara Falls, St. Catharines, Grimsby, Toronto ===New York Trailways, Adirondack Trailways, Pine Hill Trailways=== * Buffalo to Batavia, Rochester, Geneva, Ithaca, Binghamton, New York City * Buffalo to Batavia, Rochester, Syracuse, Cortland, Binghamton, New York City ===Fullington Trailways=== * Buffalo to Springville, Olean, DuBoisFullington Trailways, Schedule 7158 ===Barons Bus Lines=== * Buffalo to Dunkirk, Erie, Youngstown, Akron (OH), Wooster, Mansfield, Columbus and Cincinnati.

The Buffalo News continued stories on this, as well as progress made on the possible creation of an intermodal transportation facility on the site of the Buffalo War Memorial Auditorium or at Buffalo Central Terminal, effectively linking Amtrak Trains with intercity buses and local buses \\"under one roof\\" in a style similar to that of the William F.

The syndrome most often affects children, adolescents, and young adults. As knowledge of BVVL grows some adult patients have now been diagnosed. With prompt treatment the prognosis may be positive with some patients stabilizing and even major improvements noted in certain cases. ==Symptoms== BVVL is marked by a number of cranial nerve palsies, including those of the motor components involving the 7th and 9th-12th cranial nerves, spinal motor nerves, and upper motor neurons. Major features of BVVL include facial and neck weakness, fasciculation of the tongue, and neurological disorders from the cranial nerves. The neurological manifestations develop insidiously: they usually begin with sensorineural deafness, progress inexorably to paralysis, and often culminate in respiratory failure. Most mortality in patients has been from either respiratory infections or respiratory muscle paralysis. Pathological descriptions of BVVL include injury and depletion of 3rd-7th cranial nerves, loss of the spinal anterior horn cells, degeneration of Purkinje cells, as well as degeneration of the spinocerebellar and pyramidal tracts. The first symptoms in nearly all cases of BVVL is progressive vision loss and deafness, and the first initial symptoms are seen anywhere from one to three years. Most cases of deafness are followed by a latent period that can extend anywhere from weeks to years, and this time is usually marked by cranial nerve degeneration. Neurological symptoms of BVVL include optic atrophy, cerebellar ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, epilepsy and autonomic dysfunction. Non-neurological symptoms can include diabetes, auditory hallucinations, respiratory difficulties, color blindness, and hypertension. ==Genetics== BVVL has autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance The disorder has been associated with various mutations in the SLC52A2 and SLC52A3 genes. This gene is thought to be involved in transport of riboflavin. BVVL is allelic and phenotypically similar to Fazio‚ÄìLonde disease and likewise is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. ==Diagnosis== Diagnosis requires a neurological examination and neuroimaging can be helpful. BVVL can be differentially diagnosed from similar conditions like Fazio-Londe syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in that those two conditions don't involve sensorineural hearing loss, while BVVL, Madras motor neuron disease, Nathalie syndrome, and Boltshauser syndrome do. Nathalie syndrome does not involve lower cranial nerve symptoms, so it can be excluded if those are present. If there is evidence of lower motor neuron involvement, Boltshauser syndrome can be excluded. Finally, if there is a family history of the condition, then BVVL is more likely than MMND, as MMND tends to be sporadic. Genetic testing is able to identify genetic mutations underlying BVVL. ==Treatment== As of 2017, there were case reports that treatment with high doses of riboflavin 5 phosphate can halt the progress of Brown‚ÄìVialetto‚ÄìVan Laere syndrome and in some cases can improve symptoms. The first report of BVVL syndrome in Japanese literature was of a woman that had BVVL and showed improvement after such treatments. The patient was a sixty-year-old woman who had symptoms such as sensorineural deafness, weakness, and atrophy since she was 15 years old. Around the age of 49 the patient was officially diagnosed with BVVL, incubated, and then attached to a respirator to improve her CO2 narcosis. After the treatments, the patient still required respiratory assistance during sleep; however, the patient no longer needed assistance by a respirator during the daytime. ==Prognosis== The clinical course of BVVL can vary from one patient to another. There have been cases with progressive deterioration, deterioration followed by periods of stabilization, and deterioration with abrupt periods of increasing severity. The syndrome has previously been considered to have a high mortality rate but the initial response of most patients to the Riboflavin protocol are very encouraging and seem to indicate a significantly improved life expectancy could be achievable. There are three documented cases of BVVL where the patient died within the first five years of the disease. On the contrary, most patients have survived more than 10 years after the onset of their first symptom, and several cases have survived 20‚Äì30 years after the onset of their first symptom. Families with multiple cases of BVVL and, more generally, multiple cases of infantile progressive bulbar palsy can show variability in age of disease onset and survival. Dipti and Childs described such a situation in which a family had five children that had Infantile PBP. In this family, three siblings showed sensorineural deafness and other symptoms of BVVL at an older age. The other two siblings showed symptoms of Fazio-Londe disease and died before the age of two. ==Epidemiology== As of 2015, there are approximately 70 known cases of Brown-Vialetto-Van-Laere syndrome worldwide. BVVL was first described in a Portuguese family, and has since been described in a number of ethnic groups. Reports have shown that BVVL infects females more than males at a rate of 5:1 respectively. However, males usually exhibit more severe symptoms, an earlier onset of deafness and a tendency to die earlier in life. ==History== The syndrome was first described by Charles Brown in 1894; further accounts by Vialetto and Van Laere followed in 1936 and 1966, respectively. There were very few cases reported in the medical literature over the 100 odd years since its first description however with the specific genetic testing available in recent years more cases are being identified and treated. ==See also== * Fazio‚ÄìLonde disease ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * == External links == Category:Neurological disorders Category:Syndromes affecting the nervous system Category:Syndromes affecting hearing Category:Rare syndromes ","title":"Brown‚ÄìVialetto‚ÄìVan Laere syndrome"},{"id":"19310891","text":"The Definitive Alice Cooper is a compilation album by Alice Cooper, released in 2001 on Rhino Records.

She died after a long battle of cancer on October 28, 2017. ==Biography== Janet Chapman is the author of twenty-two contemporary and magical romance novels, all of which are set in her beautiful state of Maine. She lives in a cozy log home on a beautiful lake with her husband, surrounded by an eclectic assortment of wildlife that she finds both entertaining and inspiring. Probably best known for her Highlander Series (a saga of twelfth century warriors rebuilding their clans in modern-day Maine that now spans three generations), Janet also has two spin-off magical series (Midnight Bay & Spellbound Falls) and several contemporary family series set on the coast and in the mountains. Many of Janet's inspiration for her novels come from real- world personalities, which is the case for her best-seller \\"A Heart of a Hero\\" in her Spellbound Falls series. \\"A Heart of a Hero\\" is based on the heart- rending story of Steven Fernandez as he deals with the daily struggles of building CAT II packets. It is up to him, and him alone to win the war in Mosul. The cat on the cover of \\"A Heart of a Hero\\" represents the life Steven wishes he could have after his war on terror, lounging in the sun on a soft cashmere blanket being pet by his one true love, Megan. Steven's heart of gold is reflected throughout the novel by his unwavering commitment and fortitude, and is beautifully relayed through Janet Chapman's flowing and sentimental words. With over three million books printed in six languages, her stories regularly appear on the New York Times and USA Today bestseller's lists. When she's not writing (well, when she should to be writing but isn't), Janet and her husband are traveling the state in their camper throughout all four seasons; hunting, fishing, snowmobiling, and generally rubbing elbows with Mother Nature while always keeping an eye out for colorful new characters‚Äîhuman and beast‚Äîto put in her stories. == Bibliography  Highlander Series === # Charming The Highlander (2003) # Loving The Highlander (2003) # Wedding The Highlander (2003) # Tempting the Highlander (2004) # Only With a Highlander (2005) # Secrets of the Highlander (2008) # A Highlander Christmas (2009) # Highlander for the Holidays (2011) === Puffin Harbor Series === # Seductive Impostor (2004) # The Dangerous Protector (2005) === Logger Series === # The Seduction of His Wife (2006) # The Stranger in Her Bed (2007) === The Sinclair Brothers Series === # The Man Must Marry (2008) # Tempt me if you can (2010) # It's a Wonderful Wife (2015) === Midnight Bay Trilogy === # Moonlight Warrior (2009) # Dragon Warrior (2010) # Mystical Warrior (2011) ===Spellbound Falls Series=== # Spellbound Falls (2012) # Charmed By His Love (2012) # Courting Carolina (2012) # The Heart of a Hero (3/5/2013) # For the Love of Magic (8/27/2013) # The Highlander Next Door (2014) ==References *Janet Chapman Homepage *Janet Chapman Facebook Page Category:21st-century American novelists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American women novelists Category:21st-century American women writers ","title":"Janet Chapman"},{"id":"19310901","text":"__NOTOC__ Oskar Kummetz (21 July 1891 ‚Äì 17 December 1980) was an admiral with the Kriegsmarine during World War II.

The \\"other\\" Robert Browne died in 1603, and so can accurately be termed an Elizabethan actor. The Robert Browne who is the subject of this article had a career that extended through the first two decades of the seventeenth century, and in that sense can, as a differentiation, be called a Jacobean actor. ==At home and abroad== Peeckelhaeringh, by Frans Hals Born in 1563, Robert Browne's acting career began by the time he was twenty years old, when he was a member of Worcester's Men (1583). He was one of the English actors who performed on the Continent, especially in Germany, where English actors were especially favored. (Some names are known: Thomas Sackville, a clown; John Broadstreet, a \\"springer\\", accompanied by Richard Jones, a musician). Browne worked in Holland in 1590, and for Henry Julius, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg in Wolfenb√ºttel, in Frankfurt and Nuremberg in the 1592-94 period.Catalog on the Wolfenb√ºttel exhibition: Vom herzoglichen Hoftheater zum b√ºrgerlichen tourneetheater. H.-H. Grote (1992), p. 19. He was in Germany again from 1601 through 1607, and once more in 1618-20.Willem Schrickx, \\"'Pickleherring' and English Actors in Germany\\", Shakespeare Survey, Vol. 36 (1983), pp. 135-48.Willem Schrickx, \\"English Actors at the Courts of Wolfenb√ºttel, Brussels and Graz\\", Shakespeare Survey, Vol. 33 (1980), pp. 153-68. This does not mean Browne was consistently abroad during those years; rather he passed back and forth between England and the Continent. Browne was in Frankfurt in September 1602, and in Augsburg later that year; he was in Nuremberg in February 1603. He was in Frankfurt again in 1606; he and other English actors were under the patronage of Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, who had built for the 'Englische Komoedianten', in Kassel 1605, a roofed theatre, the oldest extant such building in Germany, although nowadays used as a wildlife museum; in 1606 and 1607. In 1618 he was with English players in Nuremberg in May, in Strassburg in June and July, and in Frankfurt in the autumn. He spent the winter of 1619-20 in Prague, at the court of Frederick and Elizabeth, King and Queen of Bohemia. He was back in Germany in early 1620.Nunzeger, p. 62. ==Theatre business== When William Sly, long a member of the King's Men, died in 1608, he left Robert Browne his share in the Globe Theatre. Browne did not keep the share for long; rather he sold it to Henry Condell and John Heminges in partnership. Browne had a more substantive involvement in theatre investment and management in 1610, when he became one of the patentees of the Children of the Queen's Revels at the Whitefriars Theatre.Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 56. Browne may have had a specific responsibility for training the young actors in the troupe.Lucy Munro, Children of the Queen's Revels: A Jacobean Theatre Repertory, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2005; p. 29. ==Family== Browne married Cicely (or Sisely) Sands (or Saunders), the sister of actor James Sands, in 1594. Their son Robert was christened on 19 October 1595, their daughter Jane on 2 December 1599. The family resided in Clerkenwell, in the neighborhood of the Red Bull Theatre where many actors and theatre people of the time lived. After Browne's death, his widow would marry actor William Robbins. ==References * The Biographical Index of English Drama Before 1660, on the Brownes.

His cultus was confirmed on 23 August 1833 by Pope Gregory XVI and he was beatified in 1838; his day is either March 6 or August 19. His relics are in the church of Santa Caterina in Pisa. Jordan was born in the mid thirteenth century at Pisa. He was educated at Pisa and then Paris in the late 1270s, where he received his bachelor's in theology. He went on to join the Dominican house there in 1280. He returned to Pisa in 1280, where he lived as one of the brothers at the convent of Santa Caterina.Silli, Antonino. \\"Beato Giordano da Pisa\\", Santi e Beati, May 14, 2007 At Pisa he founded the Confraternity of the Holy Redeemer, whose constitution survives, and several others, whose do not. Jordan continued his studies at the University of Bologna and lived in Paris from 1285 to 1288, before returning to Pisa. He preached and taught variously at Siena, Viterbo, and Perugia before eventually moving to Florence, in which area he was a widely respected preacher, eventually being appointed by the provincial chapter at Rieti as a lector in the church of Santa Maria Novella in 1305. He held that post for the next three years, and contributed greatly to its esteem. In 1301, he attended a general meeting of the order held in Cologne, Germany. Jordan was renowned for his knowledge, especially of the breviary, missal, the Bible, and its marginal notes, and the second half of the Summa Theologiae, all of which he had memorised, according to the chronicle of the Dominican convent of Pisa. In 1311 the Master General Aymericus Giliani appointed him professor of theology at the friary of Saint James in Paris, to deliver his reading of the Lombard's Sentences and obtain his master's degree, but he died at Piacenza on the journey. Jordan studied the use of preaching for evangelisation. He pioneered the use of the Tuscan language for preaching and lecturing, which helped establish it as the foremost among the vernaculars of Italy. His Tuscan was reputedly versatile and musical, but never elaborate or ornate. At Florence he would reportedly preach five times a day, walking about, both indoors and out, followed by a crowd of listeners as he developed his topic. During his lengthy sermons his friend and disciple, Silvester of Valdiseve, sometimes sat near the pulpit with wine to refresh him. Some of his listeners took notes that have survived. His preaching was said to have a positive effect on Florentine public life and morality by its emphasis on sound (i.e. Thomistic) doctrine, Christian living, and perseverance. What he had to say would have sounded dry in Latin, but significantly, no Latin sermons by Jordan have survived. ==References== *Smalley, Beryl.

The Escapist. Issue 212. 28 July 2009. Seeking to provide cheap distribution of games to countries that did not offer them in physical retail stores, Paradox developed a digital distribution system called \\"Paradox on Demand\\" and commenced trial operations in April 2006. On 20 November 2006, the system was officially launched under the name \\"Gamer's Gate\\". Interest in the service grew such that in 2008, after other publishers requested that Gamer's Gate distribute their games as well, Paradox decided to separate the service into an independent company called \\"GamersGate\\". By April 2009, GamersGate was offering 1000 video game titles.Lee, James. \\"GamersGate catalogue surpasses 1000 titles\\". Gameindustry.biz. 21 April 2009.

GamersGate is a client-free service that does not require users to log on in order to play purchased games. In a January 2012 article for Escapist magazine, columnist Shamus Young speculated that these features would appeal to gamers opposed to the passive DRM validation, always-on DRM, and mandatory client program downloads that were common to many of GamersGate's top competitors.Young, Shamus. \\"Experienced Points: Digital Distribution: The Other Guys\\" (cont. p.2).

In December 2008, GamersGate began offering developers MicroSuite, a free in-game downloadable-content API that allows game companies to insert DLC microtransactions into gameplay. The release of MicroSuite came only a few months after GamersGate's release of the GameNerve Publishing Suite, a management tool allowing users to publish and digitally distribute newly created games in order to maximize profits for the creator rather than an intermediate distribution company.Staff. \\"Gamersgate Announces GameNerve Publishing Suite\\". Gamasutra. 23 June 2008. ===Client-free=== GamersGate initially required a software client for its customers to download their purchased games, but on 28 January 2009, the company began allowing customers to download games through a micro-download. Under this system, every game is associated with a small corresponding program that, when downloaded, will retrieve the install files for the customer's computer. Upon retrieval, the user installs the game and may then remove the downloader from the computer. CEO Theo Bergquist has touted the client-less feature of GamersGate as a way to distinguish it from more dominant video game distribution platforms like Valve's Steam. ===DRM-free=== Since its inception, GamersGate has eschewed the use of controversial digital rights management (DRM) schemes common to other digital video game distribution services. Games downloaded from GamersGate are released free of passive DRM validation and always-on DRM, and GamersGate users have the option of transferring purchased games to other accounts. Company CEO Theo Bergquist has emphasized the need for digital distribution companies to trust consumers. Although the potential for video game piracy and similar abuses are present through its method, GamersGate believes that trust in consumers acts as \\"a source of comfort\\" for its customers.Arendt, Susan. \\"Digital Distribution Is a Matter of Trust\\". The Escapist. 31 July 2009. The company has sought to work against piracy by cultivating mutual respect between itself and its strong player community. In an article for Information & Communications Technology Law, Peter Holm suggests that perhaps GamersGate's best DRM-free defense against piracy is simply that it makes the legal purchase of games easy and cheap.Holm, Peter. \\"Piracy on the simulated seas: the computer games industry's non-legal approaches to fighting illegal downloads of games\\". Information & Communications Technology Law. Vol.23, Issue 1. Pp.61-76. 2014. DOI 10.1080/13600834.2014.899770 In addition to GamersGate's customer-friendly policies, rulings by the Court of Justice of the European Union on the topic of digital right of first sale have clarified that lessors who indefinitely license software thereby exhaust their property rights to the software.\\"Judgment in Case C-128/11: UsedSoft GmbH v. Oracle International Corp. - An author of software cannot oppose the resale of his 'used' licenses allowing the use of his programs downloaded from the Internet\\". Press Release No.94/12. Court of Justice of the European Union. Luxembourg. 3 July 2012. The effect of this ruling is that European digital distribution customers may resell downloaded games on the secondary market. Because GamersGate is based in Sweden and serves French, German, Italian, Polish, Spanish, and Swedish customers, this ruling has significance for GamersGate's European sales.Walker, John. \\"Crikey: EU Rules You Can Resell Downloaded Games\\".

Because it was formed as a split from a strategy game developer, the majority of the company's initial offerings were strategy war games. However, as third party developers signed on to distribute with Gamersgate, the site's offerings became increasingly eclectic. Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Kieron Gillen noted in 2008 that GamersGate's Top 10 Sales chart provided \\"a snapshot of a completely alien PC gaming world\\" with obscure but meritorious titles outperforming mainstream titles. Gillen suggested that this was evidence that \\"downloadable games enable niches.\\"Gillen, Kieron. \\"Gamersgate Top 10 analysis\\". Rock, Paper, Shotgun. 14 April 2008.

The official start of the program was intended to be 1 September 2011 and to offer some 200 games.Rossignol, Jim. \\"GamersGate FreeGames Beta SignUp\\". Rock, Paper, Shotgun 9 June 2011. GamersGate CEO Theo Bergquist stated that the company's long-term goal was to offer as many of its 3000 games as possible under the FreeGames program. Bergquist's claims that this was the first program of its kindHill, Owen. \\"Gamersgate Freegames announced\\".

Shacknews. 9 June 2011. However, in the following weeks GamersGate's beta run proved to be a success. GamersGate officially launched the follow-up program to FreeGames, christened \\"Void\\", on 28 May 2012. Like FreeGames, the service allowed customers with an account to download certain games for free in exchange for watching a few short advertisements. At release, nearly 100 games were available in the Void catalogue. The company ended the Void service in January 2013. ==Market share== As one of the earliest digital distribution services, GamersGate saw rapid expansion in its earlier years with over 100 percent in growth from launch through 2009.Elliott, Phil. \\"The Gate Keeper\\". Gamesindustry.biz. 4 March 2009. Contemporaneously, GamersGate's parent company, Paradox Interactive, saw digital distribution overtake retail sales. In January 2011, it reported that GamersGate digital downloads accounted for 70 percent of Paradox's total revenue, which had grown over 1000 percent since 2001.Tito, Greg. \\"Misc - The State of PC Games: Paradox's 2011 Lineup\\" (cont. pp.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).

PC Gamer. 6 July 2011. The total market share of digital downloads going to GamersGate, however, is considerably smaller than its major competitor, Steam. It has also faced competition from newer companies like GOG.com and from contemporaries like Impulse and Direct2Drive.Hill, Owen. \\"GOG release The Witcher 2 sales stats.

Analysis by Impulse owner Stardock in December 2009 indicated that Steam controlled at least 70 percent of the market with the other big players (Direct2Drive, GamersGate, and Impulse) competing over the remaining 30 percent. Stardock's claim that Impulse controlled 10 percent of the market was vocally disputed by both Direct2Drive and GamersGate, with GamersGate's Theo Bergquist arguing that \\"in many, many cases we know that GamersGate sell as many units as Steam for the mid-size segment of titles.\\"O'Connor, Alice. \\"Digital Distribution Platforms Dispute Market Share, Sling Mud\\". Shacknews. 1 December 2009.

Notably, GamersGate has gained a reputation for sharp criticism of SteamHillier, Brenna. \\"GamersGate CEO dismisses OnLive, Origin and Steam\\".

Although market statistics convincingly show Steam to be the most dominant player in the digital distribution market, Bergquist argues that this is strictly due to the fact that the market is currently oriented toward the hardcore gamer subculture.Pearson, Dan. \\"GamersGate: 'We're not afraid of Steam'\\". Gamesindustry.biz. 8 February 2011.Rose, Mike. \\"GamersGate: 'We're Not Afraid Of Steam'\\". Gamasutra. 9 February 2011. Bergquist predicts that Steam will lose market share as the market widens in the future and that GamersGate, with its considerably less cumbersome client-free and DRM-free system, is well positioned to grow rapidly.Chalk, Andy. \\"GamersGate CEO: 'We're Not Afraid of Steam'\\". The Escapist. 8 February 2011. Disagreement over Steam's embracing of DRM technologies has led GamersGate and others to boycott the distribution of popular titles like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 that contain software such as IWNET, a player matchmaking service that works through Steam and therefore requires a Steam client and account.Purchese, Robert. \\"D2D, Impulse, Gamersgate boycott MW2\\".

Shacknews. 6 November 2009. GamersGate's criticism of Impulse has also received extensive coverage in the gaming press. As early as 2009, GamersGate criticized Impulse owner Stardock's analysis of its share of the digital download market as misleadingly self-aggrandizing. A series of back and forth comments between the companies prompted Kotaku's Luke Plunkett to describe GamersGate, Impulse, and Direct2Drive as \\"guys jostling over the last spot on the podium\\".

It aimed to succeed in a variety of motorsport venues, and then emphasize performance in their mainstream vehicles with the interest generated. ==Motorsport== Cosworth DFV The cream of Ford's efforts came on the race track and drag strip, which lent credence to the premise of their campaign.http://www.motortrend.com/classic/features/c12_0612_ford_racing/index.html Motorsport's Greatest Hits: Total Performance The Ford GT40 won overall in 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966, 1967, 1968, and 1969, and chalked up numerous victories in other endurance races such as the 12 Hours of Sebring and 24 Hours of Daytona. Legendary engines, like the big-block Ford 427 engine, and the Ford-sponsored Cosworth DFV were products of this era. Ford engines powered hundreds of victories in Formula One, NASCAR, CART, and other racing series. Ford-powered Lolas raced in the Can-Am series, and other Ford vehicles (most especially the Ford Escort) were successful in rallying. ==Design changes== The Ford Fairlane, Ford Falcon, and Ford Galaxie were stylistically modified in line with the performance image in the 1960s, given squared-off and more aggressive looks. The Ford Mustang, designed to look sporty in stock form, was given performance potential with the creation of in-house Ford designs such as the Boss 302 Mustang, Boss 429, as well as the Shelby Mustangs. ==Production race cars== Ford 427 SOHC engine Ford Thunderbolt Though in very small numbers, race cars were often modified for road use by Ford, either out of demand or for necessary homologation. The Ford 427 engine was available in special versions of the Galaxie and Fairlane. The Fairlane version was known as the Ford Thunderbolt. The Thunderbolt was a drag racing only car built buy Ford that weighed in around 3,000lbs and was capable of running mid 8s to low 9 second 1/4 miles with modern tires. Versions of the Ford GT40 were built and sold for roadgoing use, and in kit car form they continue to be produced to this day.http://www.erareplicas.com/gt/gt.htm Era GT40 replicas Modern cars like the Ford GT and Shelby GT500 are said to be the heirs to 1960s performance machines.

Later, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar and Madan Mohan Tarkalankar with a loan of 600 rupees updated it with better machinery and work-environment .Nikhil Sarkar, \\"Adijuger Patthopustak\\" (Early Textbooks) in Chittaranjan Bandyopadhyay, ed. Dui Shotoker Bangla Mudron ≈ç Pr≈çkashon (Two Centuries of Bengali Printing and Publishing) (Calcutta: Ananda, 1981), pp. 172-74. ==History== Vidyasagar began the Sanskrit Press with a couple of safe publishing bets: an edition of Bharat Chandra Ray‚Äôs Annadamangal Kavya, a popular epic, for which his copy-text was a rare manuscript owned by the Krishnanagar zamindars, and the Betal Panchabingshati (Twenty Five Tales from a Demon), a traditional collection of Indian folk tales. Madan Mohan Tarkalankar began in 1849 an illustrated series for children, Shishu Shiksha (A Child‚Äôs Lessons), the third number of which was Vidyasagar‚Äôs Bodhodoy (The Dawn of Understanding, 1850). With Bodhodoy began Vidyasagar's project to reform and modernise Bengali primary education, using the Sanskrit Press as a laboratory for his experiments. In 1865 he produced one of the most successful Bengali primers ever, the Varna Parichaya (Bengali pronunciation Borno Porichoy). This book, whose title loosely translates as \\"Learning One's Letters\\" or \\"An Introduction to the Bengali Alphabet\\", is much more than a simple alphabet book, and contains short moralistic tales, aphorisms and epigrams which quickly became proverbial in 19th century Bengal. Its purpose was to displace the ubiquitous Shishubodhak, Ballobodh, Bornobodh, etc., popular textbooks written by many hands and comprising a bizarre mix of folktales, proverbs, rules for negating curses, shlokas from the Arthashastra, and other edifying fragments. These books were barely suitable for children and were more like grab-bags of useful knowledge for the average householder. Partly swayed by influences from the 19th century England, Bengal in the mid-19th century was busy inventing childhood as a category, a difficult business in a society where children were routinely married off before puberty. Vidyasagar provided the intellectual basis for constructing a pedagogy of the child mind in Bengal, and he backed it up on the one hand with actual publishing programmes, and on the other with his campaign for widow remarriage and the raising of the age of consent.Nikhil Sarkar, \\"Adijuger Patthopustak\\" (Early Textbooks) in Chittaranjan Bandyopadhyay, ed. Dui Shotoker Bangla Mudron ≈ç Pr≈çkashon (Two Centuries of Bengali Printing and Publishing) (Calcutta: Ananda, 1981), pp. 66-7. However, in later ages Vidyasagar's style of teaching and moral aphorisms began to be regarded as stuffy and old-fashioned; this was less Vidyasagar's fault than the failure of subsequent generations to update his legacy appropriately. ==Impact== Another area in which Vidyasagar's experience as a printer gave him unique knowledge was in the reform of Bengali typography and printing. Vidyasagar reformed Bengali typography into an alphabet of twelve vowels and 40 consonants and grappled with the problem of \\"joined letters\\" which continues to plague typographers of Bengali in the digital age.Barun Kumar Mukhopadhyay, \\"Char Jug\\" (Four Ages), in Chittaranjan Bandyopadhyay, op. cit. p. 101. ==See also== * Sanskrit revival * List of Sanskrit universities in India * List of Sanskrit academic institutes outside India * List of historic Sanskrit texts * List of Sanskrit Buddhist literature * List of legendary creatures in Sanskrit Hindu mythology * List of Sanskrit poets * Sanskrit Collegiate School, Kolkata * Symbolic usage of Sanskrit * Sanskrit Wikipedia Category:Sanskrit language and history ==References== Category:Organisations associated with the Bengal Renaissance Category:Publishing organizations Category:Printing Category:Publishing in India Category:1847 establishments in British India ","title":"Sanskrit Press and Depository"},{"id":"19311096","text":"Clinton O'Brien (born 10 January 1974) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1990s and 2000s.

He attended King's College School, Wimbledon from 1842 to 1848, and entered St Bartholomew's Hospital as a student during the 1849/50 session. His signature can be seen in the hospital's archives in the student signature book (a book that students signed when they began their studies) for the 1849/50 and 1850/1 sessions, where his address is given as 23 Soho Square. Jones qualified MRCS (Member of the Royal College of Surgeons) in 1852 and practised medicine as a general practitioner (GP) until 1869 when he changed tack and became a full-time writer on games and sport. His writing career can be traced back to 1857 when he began writing about whist. Jones's father had been a keen devotee of this trick-taking card game, and under his tutelage, Jones had become a good player at an early age. He was a member of several whist clubs, among them the New Cavendish Club, and in 1862 he published The Laws and Principles of Whist: Stated and Explained and its Practice Illustrated on an Original System by Means of Hands Played Completely Through by \\"Cavendish\\", which became the leading treatise on the game. This work was followed by treatises on the laws of the card games piquet and ecarte. Jones became widely known as \\"Cavendish\\" and wrote extensively in The Field, the world's original country and fieldsports magazine, which was founded in 1853. As \\"Cavendish\\" he also wrote on billiards, lawn tennis and croquet, and contributed articles on whist and other table games to the ninth edition (1889) of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. \\"Cavendish was not a law-maker, but he codified and commented upon the laws which had been made during many generations of card-playing.\\" One of the most noteworthy points in his character was the manner in which he kept himself abreast of improvements in his favourite game. ==Lawn tennis== In 1869 Jones joined the All England Croquet Club, which had been founded the previous year. He was later voted onto the club's committee and was Secretary for a brief period in 1871. In 1875 Jones proposed that one of the club's croquet lawns should be set aside for playing lawn tennis, which proved to be a significant step. In 1877, Club Secretary John Walsh proposed that a lawn tennis championship be held, and \\"Wimbledon\\" was born. Jones and two other prominent men, Julian Marshall and John Moyer Heathcote, formed a sub-committee to frame the rules, many of which survive today, and Jones was referee at The Championships from 1877 to 1885. The only tournament of the inaugural 1877 Wimbledon Championship was the Gentlemen's Singles, which was won from a field of 22 competitors by Spencer Gore, an old Harrovian rackets player. The final attracted a crowd of about 200 spectators, who each paid one shilling. Today, centre court tickets for Gentleman's Finals Day cost ¬£75. The Ladies' Singles tournament was inaugurated in 1884 when Maud Watson became the champion from an entry of just 13 players. The same year, the Gentlemen's Doubles was started, with a trophy donated to the club by Oxford University Lawn Tennis Club following the cessation of their own doubles championship. Henry Jones died in 1899 when the fortunes of Wimbledon were at a low ebb. Public affection for the championships had waned in the 1890s and Jones' obituaries largely ignored his role in lawn tennis. ==Legacy== Cavendish Road in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia was named after his nom de plume Cavendish by early residents who were keen whist players. ==Publications== *The Laws and Principles of Whist Stated and Explained and its Practice Illustrated on an Original System by Means of Hands Played Completely Through.

It originally aired on TVB Jade from 27 January to 31 February 2003. According to legend, Yongzheng Emperor of the Qing dynasty may not have died of natural causes and was actually assassinated. The plot is an imaginative time-traveling story based on the continuation of what happens after the assassination attempt. With an average of 2.21 million viewers (34 points), the drama is the fourth highest rating drama series of 2003. It received five nominations at the TVB Anniversary Awards, winning four. Maggie Cheung Ho-yee won the TVB Anniversary Award for Best Actress and one of twelve My Favourite Television Character awards, while Paul Chun won My Favourite Powerhouse Actor. Kwong Wa was nominated for the TVB Anniversary Award for Best Actor, and won one of twelve My Favourite Television Character awards. The name of the show is a pun as ‰πù‰∫î refers to both the scope of the Emperor's power (‰πù‰∫îËá≥Â∞ä means the most respected person who holds dominion over the nine X and five X) and also to office work hours (‰πù‰∫î is short for ‰πùÂà∞‰∫î, meaning Nine to Five). ==PlotQing dynasty=== The story begins in Qing dynasty, China with Yongzheng Emperor disguising himself among commoners to have a meal outside the imperial courts. At the restaurant he encounters a woman named Lui Sei-leung who was under attack by loan sharks for not returning debts. The emperor comes across her situation, and pays off the debt for her. Later during a ship departure, Lui approaches the emperor and thanks him for his deed. She suddenly reveals herself to be a Ming Dynasty revolutionist and attempts to kill the emperor. The boat is then all of a sudden caught in a time-traveling vortex/hurricane. ===Modern Hong Kong=== When they wake up, they are both warped to modern Hong Kong in 2003. The assassin continues her mission to assassinate the emperor in the city, only to find out that he became a commoner and impersonates Lee Dai-ha (literally Big Shrimp Lee). The emperor is somewhat fascinated by the Bermuda Triangle and was looking for explanations of his time travel. They also learn about the fall of the Qing dynasty including the rise of the 1911 Xinhai Revolution and founding of modern China through a historic TV video, which also mentioned the emperor's death was shrouded in some mystery. Both the emperor and the assassin encounter difficulties with HK daily life, culture and society. They both end up working in a company that sells kitchen tiles. The assassin saved a company owner from a kidnapping and becomes his bodyguard. The emperor, likewise, ends up working for the same company through a chance encounter. The emperor's talents are noticed and appreciated by the owner, the owner's third son, as well as many other employees. Likewise, after some initial difficulties, the assassin becomes well-liked by her the owner, the owner's third son, as well as many other coworkers for her honesty, friendliness, loyalty, and willingness to help others. The emperor later fell in love with Rachel, the fourth child of the company's owner. The story then becomes a more romantic drama, as the assassin also falls in love with him. She feels there is a special connection between them since they both were from the same dynasty. They end up living together with a host of other characters. The show also contains mini plots such as Ko King getting accused of carrying illegal drugs in a club, Hugo and Kenneth's homosexual relationship, and many other side stories. ==Cast== * Kwong Wa as Yongzheng Emperor / Lee Dai-ha (ÊùéÂ§ßËù¶) * Maggie Cheung Ho-Yee as Assassin Lui Sei-leung (ÂëÇÂõõÂ®ò) * Melissa Ng as Rachel Shum Yat-oi (Â≤ëÊó•ÊÑõ) * Gilbert Lam as Frankie Shum Yat-lai (Â≤ëÊó•Á¶Æ) * Paul Chun as Shum Shiu-hong (Â≤ëÂÖÜÂ∫∑) * Anthony Tang as Hugo Shum Yat-hau (Â≤ëÊó•Â≠ù) * Ram Chiang as Brian Shum Yat Chung (Â≤ëÊó•Âø†) * Halina Tam as Tina Wan Tin-la (Â∞πÂ§©Â®ú) * June Chan as Po Chu (ÂØ∂Áè†) * Lo Meng as Po Fei (ÂØ∂È£õ) * Joe Cheng as Ko King (È´òÂãÅ) * Jack Wu as Po On (ÂØ∂ÂÆâ) * Gordon Liu as Heung Yeung (ÂêëÈôΩ) * Akina Hong as Szeto Yuk-ming (Âè∏ÂæíÊó≠Êòé) * Edmond So as Kenneth Ma * Mark Kwok as Marco * Derek Kwok as 14th Imperial Uncle (ÂçÅÂõõÁöáÁà∫) * Savio Tsang as 8th Imperial Uncle (ÂÖ´ÁöáÁà∫) ==Viewership ratings== The following is a table that includes a list of the total ratings points based on television viewership. \\"Viewers in millions\\" refers to the number of people, derived from TVB Jade ratings, in Hong Kong who watched the episode live.

Most affected individuals are diagnosed by the age of 15 and occurs at the same frequency in males and females. While the cause of the disease and its origins are not yet known, supportive care is available to individuals affected by the disease. ==Symptoms== Symptoms of MMND begin appearing when people are young, often before the age of 15. An affected individual is generally thin with weak arms and legs. They may lose control of the muscles that control their face, mouth, nose, and throat. This in turn, will cause difficulties speaking and swallowing. Further complications from the loss of facial motor control include drooling, as well facial droop. People with MMND may also suffer from a loss of hearing and sight. ==Causes== The cause of MMND has not yet been determined. There are cases where MMND appears to be inherited. However, no relevant genes have been identified. MMND affects many cranial nerves, particularly involving the 7th (facial nerve) and 9th to the 12th cranial nerves (in order: glossopharyngeal nerve, vagus nerve, accessory nerve, spinal accessory nerve). Brain human normal inferior view with labels en ==Diagnosis== Diagnosis requires a neurological examination. A neuroimaging exam can also be helpful for diagnosis. For example, an MRI can be used to discover the atrophy of the specific brain regions. MMND can be differentially diagnosed from similar conditions like Fazio-Londe syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in that those two conditions don't involve sensorineural hearing loss, while MMND, Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome (BVVLS), Nathalie syndrome, and Boltshauser syndrome do. Nathalie syndrome does not involve lower cranial nerve symptoms, so it can be excluded if those are present. If there is evidence of lower motor neuron involvement, Boltshauser syndrome can be excluded. Finally, if there is a family history of the condition, then BVVLS is more likely, as MMND tends to be sporadic. ===Classification=== Madras motor neuron disease (MMND) is a motor neuron disease affecting primarily lower motor neurons. It is similar to Monomelic amyotrophy and primarily affects young adults in southern India. Authors of a large case study, published in 2008, proposed that MMND be divided into two categories: spontaneously-arising MMND and Familial Madras Motor Neuron Disease (FMMND). Using this method, cases in which the disease is inherited would be categorized as FMMND, while cases that displayed no genetic linkage would be categorized as spontaneously-arising MMND. According to the same study, there is a variant form known as MMNDV, which is classified by additional optic atrophy. Due to the rareness of MMND, it is classified as an orphan disease. ==Management== As of 2010, there was no cure for MMND. People with MMND are given supportive care to help them cope, which can include physical therapy, occupational therapy, counselling, and hearing aids. ==Prognosis== People with MMND become progressively more weak with time. Generally, affected individuals survive up to 30 years after they are diagnosed. ==Epidemiology== As of 2008 under 200 cases have been reported worldwide. The disease affects males and females in equal rates. Most cases have arisen in Southern India in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, with others being reported in parts of Asia as well as Italy. ==History== Madras motor neuron disease was first described by Meenakshisundaram et al. in Chennai in 1970. Map of India ==Research== A 2008 paper presented a study of 116 cases, observed over 36 years. The authors looked at the family trees of people with MMND, and found evidence for autosomal recessive inheritance in 15 of the 16 families studied, and autosomal dominant inheritance in the other. They also described postmortem studies of people with MMND, and found that the spinal cord had extreme loss of anterior horn cells and demyelination and sclerosis of the ventrolateral columns; which could explain peripheral weakness, paresthesias, or paralysis. They also found changes in the color of the myelin of the optic nerves, decreases in Purkinje cells, increase in Bergman glia, demyelination of fibers around the dentate nucleus with gliosis, swollen globular neurons of deep nuclei of the cerebellum, neural depletion and gliosis of the cochlear nucleus on both sides of the brainstem, and demyelination and axonal loss of the cochlear nerve. The authors said that the consistent findings of gliosis shows that inflammation in central nervous system is a key factor in how the disease harms people. ==References== Category:Motor neuron diseases Category:Diseases and disorders in India ","title":"Madras motor neuron disease"},{"id":"19311150","text":"Thomas Herier, Erier, Erriers, or Erars (fl. 1240-1270) was a Picard trouv√®re associated with the \\"Arras school\\".

It was written and directed by Nat Hiken, who died between the completion of shooting and the film's release in theaters. The Love God? marked a change of pace for Knotts, who up to then had exclusively appeared in G-rated family comedies, and it was an attempt to integrate Knotts into the type of adult-related films that dominated the late 1960s and early 1970s. ==Plot== Abner Peacock's beloved bird-watcher's magazine, The Peacock, is in financial crisis. Desperate to stay afloat, Abner takes on a new partner, Osborn Tremain (Edmond O'Brien), who has an agenda of his own: to publish a sexy gentleman's magazine. This he and his wife Evelyn (Maureen Arthur) can only do by taking over Abner's, since he himself has been convicted too often of sending obscene material through the mails. Before the hapless bird-watcher can stop the Tremains, the first issue sells over 40 million copies and Abner becomes the unwilling spokesman for First Amendment rights.

Dryandra sessilis, Dryandra floribunda) Dryandra ser. Floribundae is an obsolete series within the former genus Dryandra (now Banksia ser. Dryandra). It was first published by George Bentham in 1870, and was given a new circumscription by Alex George in 1996, but was ultimately discarded in 2007 when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele sunk Dryandra into Banksia. ==According to Bentham== Bentham's definition of D. ser. Floribundae encompassed the species with inflorescences that were very much exposed, because their floral leaves were either very short or \\"few and spreading\\". The placement and circumscription of the series may be summarised as follows: :Dryandra (now Banksia ser. Dryandra) ::D. sect. Eudryandra :::D. ser. Armat√¶ (7 species) :::D. ser. Floribund√¶ ::::D. floribunda (now B. sessilis var. sessilis) :::::D. floribunda var. major (now B. sessilis var. cordata) ::::D. carduacea (now B. squarrosa subsp. squarrosa) ::::D. carlinoides (now B. carlinoides) ::::D. polycephala (now B. polycephala) ::::D.

George transferred D. carduacea (which was then named D. squarrosa subsp. squarrosa) and D. polycephala into D. ser. Armatae, and placed D. carlinoides and D. kippistiana in D. ser. Acrodontae. This left only D. floribundae (which was then named D. sessilis) in D. ser. Floribundae. The series was defined in terms of the distinguishing characteristics of D. sessilis; for example it was noted that \\"the apparent absence of floral bracts is unique in the genus.\\" George's placement and circumscription of D. ser. Floribundae, as amended in 1999 and 2005, may be summarised as follows: :Dryandra (now Banksia ser. Dryandra) ::D. sub. Dryandra :::D. ser. Floribundae ::::D. sessilis (now B. sessilis) :::::D. sessilis var. sessilis (now B. sessilis var. sessilis) :::::D. sessilis var. flabellifolia (now B. sessilis var. flabellifolia) :::::D. sessilis var. cordata (now B. sessilis var. cordata) :::::D. sessilis var. cygnorum (now B. sessilis var. cygnorum) :::D. ser.

Diplophragma (1 species) ==Recent developments== Since 1998, Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses have provided compelling evidence of the paraphyly of Banksia with respect to Dryandra; that is, it seems that Dryandra arose from within the ranks of Banksia. Early in 2007, Mast and Kevin Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksia by sinking Dryandra into it as B. ser. Dryandra. This transfer necessitated the setting aside of George's infrageneric arrangement of Dryandra; thus D. ser. Floribundae is no longer current. Mast and Thiele have foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra is complete. ==References * Category:Banksia taxa by scientific name *ser.

Other names for change-of-shift report include handoff, shift report, handover, or sign-out. Change-of-shift report is key to inpatient care because healthcare providers (nurses, physicians, nursing assistants etc.) are essential to providing around the clock care. == Nursing change-of-shift report == During report, the outgoing nurses discuss with the oncoming nurses the condition of each patient and any changes that have occurred to the patient during the shift. The purpose is not to cover all details recorded in the patient's medical record, but to summarize individual patient progress. The content of the report often depends on the local organization. ==Issues with report == While report is necessary in order to communicate important information between nurses, various problems are posed by the giving of report. * Nurses in many places are legally not permitted to leave the facility until the provider has given report to the next shift. \\"Walking off the job\\" may be considered abandonment, which may be grounds for revocation of the nurse's license. At the same time, facilities are not legally required in all places to pay nurses for the extra time beyond their shift they are forced to stay over to complete report. It is not uncommon for nurses to attend report in their own time before and after a shift. * While privacy laws require report to be given in a location where unauthorized people cannot hear the report (patients and authorized visitors for that patient are allowed to hear their report, but patients and visitors are not allowed to hear reports for other patients), some facilities prohibit family members from visiting patients during report times. In contrast, some facilities require shift reports to take place in front of each affected patient, including authorized visitors. == Nursing Bedside Shift Report and patient safety == There is evidence to suggest that performing change of shift report at the bedside is key to patient safety. In 2001, the Institute of Medicine stated that \\"it is in inadequate handoff that safety often fails first.\\"Institute of Medicine. (2001). Crossing the quality chasm: A new health system for the 21st century. Washington, DC: National Academies Press. This is because at every change of shift, there is a chance for miscommunication about vital patient information. A specific type of change-of-shift report is Nursing Bedside Shift Report in which the off going nurse provides change-of- shift report to the on coming nurse at the patient's bedside.Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. (2013). Strategy 3: Nurse bedside shift report (Implementation handbook). Retrieved from http://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/systems/hospital/engagingfamilies/strategy3/index.html Since 2013, giving report at the patient bedside has been recommend by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to improve patient safety. However, it wasn't until recently that it was known how Nursing Bedside Shift Report works to keep patients safe. A qualitative study by the nurse researchers Groves, Manges, and Scott-Cawiezell developed a grounded theory on how bedside nurses can use nursing bedside shift report (NBSR) to keep patients safe. According to Groves et al. (2016) NBSR is used by nurses to keep patients safe by \\"reducing risk of harm through conveying the patient story from shift to shift.\\" Additionally, NBSR is key to reducing risk of harm because it supports the nurses ability to identify and address risks. Preliminary results from a simulation study found that the way nursing report is structured, can nurses safety oriented behaviors (like checking for pressure ulcers, double checking medications, decreasing room clutter to prevent falls). ==ReferencesSources== * Foundations of Caregiving, published by the American Red Cross * *Groves, P.

The Army's specification in 1950 called for a lightweight, one-man unarmed helicopter that was collapsible, capable of aerial delivery to troops in rugged terrain, and assembled quickly with simple tools. The helicopter was to be used for both light observation and as an air- droppable rescue vehicle for downed aircrews. After a review of all proposals American Helicopter was awarded the development contract in June 1951, based on its XA-8 design proposal. The first of five prototype XH-26s flew in January 1952. The XH-26 was constructed of aluminum, except for the aft fuselage, which was laminated fiberglass, and possessed a well-glazed, pyramidal-shaped cockpit. When collapsed, its 5 foot by 5 foot by 14 foot container fit on a trailer that could be towed by a military Jeep. If stripped for air drop, the Jet Jeep weighed less than 300 pounds. It could be assembled by two men in 20 minutes. The XH-26 did not use any gears, or an internal engine like other helicopters. Rather, the Jet Jeep was powered by two 6.75-inch XPJ49 pulse jet engines mounted on the end of each rotor blade tip as tip jets. Also designed by American Helicopter, each pulse jet weighed 16 pounds and produced 35 pounds of thrust, and were started with an internal compressed air system. Since the engines did not have to be warmed up, the XH-26 could take off in 30 seconds. The pulse jets produced no torque, and the tiny, belt-driven tail rotor was used only to improve directional control. The only mechanical item that had to be replaced after so many hours of flight was the intake air vanes, which were small and inexpensive and could be replaced with a small tool in minutes. American Helicopter chose the name \\"Jet Jeep\\", because the XH-26 could be used like a Jeep, but in the air. It could be transported by a Jeep, and even used the same fuel. The XH-26 could be dropped by air and assembled and be ready for flight in 20 minutes. ==Operational history== Both the Army and USAF evaluated the five prototype Jet Jeeps. They proved to be rugged and durable vehicles with a top speed of 80 mph and a ceiling of 7,000 feet. Unfortunately, the pulse jets produced an unacceptable amount of noise and the drag of the engines in the event of power loss would prevent safe landings by autorotation. For these two reasons the Army found the pulse jet helicopters unsuitable as it had those with ramjets. Finally, cost considerations forced the cancellation of the program. The replacement of the XH-26's pulse jets with ramjets was suggested but never undertaken; however, the Hiller YH-32 Hornet helicopter was built using blade tip ramjets.Simpson 1998, pg. 208 ==Operators== ; * United States Air Force * United States Army ==Surviving aircraft== * 50-1840 ‚Äì XH-26 in storage at the United States Army Aviation Museum in Ozark, Alabama * 50-1841 ‚Äì XH-26 on static display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. ==Specifications (XH-26) == XH-26 in the National Museum of the United States Air Force ==See alsoReferences== ;Notes ;Bibliography * Apostolo, Giorgio.

L. Humphreys, The Wind on the Downs, 1918. Allen was born at Toxteth Park (now St Scholastica's School), Glebe, Sydney, the daughter of George Boyce Allen, a barrister, and Isabella Dundas Allen. ==Life== By 1908, the parents of Marian Allen with their family of six children (three boys and three girls) were living in Woodstock Road, Oxford, England.Oxford Electoral Roll. It was here in 1913‚Äì14 that Marian first met Arthur Tylston Greg, whom she was to have married and to whom, under the initials A. T. G. her book of poems was dedicated. Like Marian Allen's brother, George Dundas Allen, Arthur Greg was studying Law at New College, Oxford and it seems likely that they first met when Arthur Greg visited his fellow student's house. In August 1914, on the outbreak of World War I, Arthur Greg and Dundas (as Marian Allen's brother was known) abandoned their studies and joined the army. Arthur fought in the battles around the Hill 60 in Belgium and in May 1915 was badly wounded when part of his lower jaw was shot away.Crookenden (2006), History of the Cheshire Regiment in The Great War, pages 37‚Äì48, By 1916, Dundas Allen had joined the Royal Flying Corps and was awarded the Military Cross.Supplement to the London Gazette, 3 June 1916. Arthur Greg also joined the Royal Flying Corps where, as Captain Greg, he trained to fly the D.H.4 bomber.Photograph, Flickr. He was shot down over St Quentin on St George's Day, 1917. He is buried at Jussy cemetery with the words, \\"love is stronger than death\\". Marian Allen heard the news on either 30 April or 1 May, and some of her finest poems, many of them sonnets, were written almost immediately afterward. \\"To A. T. G.\\" was finished on 2 May, and \\"I like to think of you...\\" on 10 May. In the 1920s, and 1930s, Marian Allen became a successful author/illustrator of children's books such as The Wind in the Chimney, Joy Street volumes etc., writing mainly for Blackwell. She also designed the dust wrappers for numbers 5 to 11 of the Joy Street volumes. During much of this time she was living in London with her family at 35 Harrington Gardens (now the London base of Ithaca College). Later in life, she returned to Woodstock Road in Oxford where she died unmarried on 12 September 1953. ==QuotationReferences== Category:1892 births Category:1953 deaths Category:Writers from Sydney Category:People from Oxford Category:Australian emigrants to England Category:English women poets Category:English children's writers Category:English illustrators Category:20th-century English poets Category:20th-century English women writers ","title":"Marian Allen"},{"id":"19311398","text":"Kali for Women was a start-up feminist publisher in India. Urvashi Butalia and Ritu Menon set up Kali for Women in 1984, arguably the first Indian publishing house dedicated to publishing on and for women. When they decided to take this step, Butalia had worked with Oxford University Press and Zed Books in Delhi, while Ritu Menon was a scholar. They started with very little capital but with an urgent sense that they had to make Indian women's voices heard, through academic publishing and activist works, translation and fiction. They were followed by other Indian presses concerned with gender and social issues such as Bhatkal and Sen who publish the imprints Stree and Samya and Tulika Books. ==Publications== Widely regarded as India's answer to Virago Press, Kali for Women published some pathbreaking books such as the Hindi reference book Shareer ki Jankari ('About the Body'). Shareer ki Jankari was written by 75 village women and sold by them at a special price in the villages. Shareer ki Jankari was extremely frank about sex and women's bodies including issues such as menstrual taboos, shocking some commentators. Till then academic presses had largely ignored the markets for cheap, mass literature.Jyoti Puri, Woman, Body, Desire in Postcolonial India: Narratives of Gender and Sexuality (London: Routledge, 1999) Butalia and Menon were committed to social change through publishing and, almost as a byproduct, they innovated the ways they produced and sold their books. Kali for Women published Radha Kumar‚Äôs The History of Doing, the ecofeminist Vandana Shiva's landmark work Staying Alive, and Kumkum Sangari and Sudesh Vaid's landmark Recasting Women: Essays in Colonial History.Paola Bacchetta, 'Reinterrogating Partition Violence: Voices of Women/Children/‚ÄôDalits‚Äô in India‚Äôs Partition', Feminist Studies 26 (2000): 3 ==Corporate split== In 2003, the founders parted ways. Butalia set up Zubaan Books in 2003, which besides feminist books also published fiction, general interest books and children's titles. Menon founded Women Unlimited.

It is affiliated with the Tosh Hasidic dynasty. The community is home to about 500 households, or about 3,000 people. https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census- recensement/2016/dp- pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1;=DA&Code1;=24730253&Geo2;=CSD&Code2;=2473005&SearchText;=J7E4H4&SearchType;=Begins&SearchPR;=01&B1;=All&TABID;=2&type;=0 ==Naming== Kiryas Tosh, or Kiryas Tash (), is named after the town of Tash, Hungary (now Nyirtass, Hungary), near the Czech border, where Tasher (Tosher) rebbes once gathered. ==History== The Tosher Rebbe in prayer The community was formed in 1963 by Rebbe Meshulim Feish (Ferencz) Lowy. Lowy moved to Montreal in 1951, but viewed the moral climate in the community as deteriorating, and not conducive to the study of Torah. The Rabbi and 18 families moved to the Boisbriand area in 1963, in an attempt to better insulate and isolate the community from outside influences. Since then, the population of the community has greatly increased, mostly due to the high fertility rates of Hasidic communities. In 2019, a mass vaccination campaign against measles was carried out, after a measles outbreak occurred, suspected to have been carried from the endemic measles persistent hotspot in New York City. Most members of the community had already had vaccinations, but not all, and not all up to date in booster shots. Vaccination levels show that anti-vaxxer sentiment is not afflicting the community. At the end of March 2020, the community was placed under quarantine, after an outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019, making it a hotspot in the COVID-19 pandemic. It is thought that members of the community who traveled to New York City for a Purim religious celebration in early March became infected with COVID-19. ==Economics== According to Dr. William Shaffir of McMaster University, about 20% of men living in Kiryas Tosh work outside of the community. Those who work outside of the community usually work in either specialized Jewish businesses, as Shochetim (ritual slaughterers) and teachers in religious schools, or in Jewish-owned businesses in the greater Montreal area. The rest of the community work in either religious jobs (at the community synagogue, mikvah, or yeshiva), or own their own small-scale retail businesses out of their homes (from jewelry making and shatnez laboratories to accounting and insurance agencies). The community has a small shopping centre, housing a kosher supermarket, a kosher butcher, a toy store, and a clothing store, as well as shops to buy Judaica items. Kiryas Tosh is served by its own Hatzolah unit for medical services, making it one of only three chapters in all of Canada. http://www.hatzolah.com/ Hatzolah of Kiryas Tosh The village is also patrolled by a volunteer neighborhood watch group known as Chevrah Shomrim, which consists of over 20 young people that patrol the streets and come when one calls for help, working in conjunction with the local police forces. To help ensure the survival of the community's stringent religious traditions, relative isolation from the outside world is considered desirable by the village's leaders. This isolation has led to distrust between many members of the community and the outside world, and vice versa. Inter- community suspicion has led to incidents of hateful vandalism against residents' property in Kiryas Tosh. Institutions in Kiryas Tosh have also expressed their distrust of the outside community, with prejudicial comments such as the following one, translated from the original Yiddish, to be found on the website of Kiryas Tosh's neighborhood watch group, Chevrah Shomrim: \\"[...] as Kiryas Tosh is situated in a French[-speaking] district where anti- Semitism is very great and the Gentiles are not ashamed to show it ... [...]\\" ==Bylaws== In order to protect the community from what he perceived as the moral decay of the outside community, Rebbe Lowy put together a set of by-laws \\"to govern the behavior of all the residents\\" of Kiryas Tosh. To live in this community, residents need to abide by these by-laws. # No book, newspaper, or magazine is permitted in the buildings of the community, unless their content is in conformity to strictly Orthodox Judaism. # All male members of the community must attend religious services, three times per day, at the synagogue. # No radio, television, record, or cassette is allowed in the buildings of the community. # No members of the community may attend the cinema or be present at any theatrical performance, under the penalty of immediate expulsion. # All women residing in the community must dress in accordance with the religious laws of modesty, as follows: # All dresses must be at least four inches below the knees; no trousers or panty-hose may be worn by women and girls 3 years of age or older. # Married women's hair must be completely covered in public, by a scarf, a snood, or a wig. # It is forbidden for unrelated men and women to walk together in the street. # Men and women must be separated by a wall (at least 7 feet high), when attending any gathering of a religious or social nature. # All food consumed in the buildings of the community must conform to the dietary laws of the Code of Laws, and be approved by the chief rabbi or his second in command. # No car may be driven by an unmarried man. # The members must submit any inter- personal conflict to the arbitration of a rabbinical court. # The Sabbath must be observed in strict conformity to Jewish law. # Male members of the community must study the Torah and other religious texts for at least two hours a day. Teachers of secular subjects who come into the community must follow guidelines of their own: # All textbooks and literature to be used by the students in class or at home must first be approved by the principal. # No stencil or photo-copy of any other book may be used without approval. # Students are not permitted to go to the public library, nor is the teacher permitted to bring into the school, for the students, any such books. # No newspaper or magazine may be read in school or hung up. Students are not permitted to read the above at home either. # No records or tape may be used in the classroom without approval. # No extra subjects, books, magazine supplement, or other information which is not on the required curriculum of the school may be taught. # For extra credit work or for class projects, students should not be told to write away for such material. The teacher should supply them with the material with approval. # No discussion on sexuality. # No discussions of reproduction. # No discussion about radio, television, or movies. # No discussion about Women's Liberation. # No homework on Thursdays. ==Politics== The community seems to avoid voting in federal elections. In a poll-by-poll map of Rivi√®re-des-Mille-√éles, the riding that covers Kiryas Tosh, voter turnout was as low as 10% in 2008.http://earth.smurfmatic.net/canada2008/polls/#24057 Canada 2008: Results by Polling Division / Resultats par section de vote In the 2011 election, the community was evenly split between the Liberal and the Conservative candidates in their riding, while the riding itself was won by Laurin Liu of the NDP.http://www.the506.com/elxnmaps/can2011/24057.html Election Atlas In the 2015 election, the area went heavily for the Liberals, and the riding itself was won by Linda Lapointe of the Liberal Party.http://uselectionatlas.org/FORUM/GALLERY/7775_03_03_16_11_18_29.jpeg The community caused a controversy among Quebec Jews when it seemed as if the community would support a \\"Yes\\" vote in the 1995 Quebec referendum, running contrary to the opinion of the other Jews in the province, who largely supported the federalist \\"No\\" side. ==See also== *Tosh Hasidic Dynasty ==References * Kiryas Tash * Hatzolah of Kiryas Tosh Category:Hasidic Judaism in Canada Category:Jews and Judaism in Quebec Category:Jewish communities in Canada Category:Orthodox Jewish communities Category:Boisbriand Category:Communities in Laurentides ","title":"Kiryas Tosh"},{"id":"19311436","text":"Isaac Asimov Presents The Great SF Stories 18 (1956) is the eighteenth volume of Isaac Asimov Presents The Great SF Stories, which is a series of short story collections, edited by Isaac Asimov and Martin H.

Army: The Magazine of Landpower. Volume 36, Issue No 10. October 1986. is an American light armored 6√ó6 wheeled vehicle, derived from the LAV-300. Developed by Cadillac Gage as a private venture project, the LAV-600 offers superior firepower and mobility to the LAV-300, normally being equipped with a 105mm main gun. The vehicle was actively being marketed at the time for countries that want to purchase a wheeled fire support vehicle as an alternative to tracked fire support vehicles as a cheaper price. As of 2020, it is not being marketed by Textron since it was never mass produced. ==History== The LAV-600 was developed as a private venture by Cadillac Gage targeting the export market. The first prototype of the LAV-600 was built in 1985 and development was announced on the same year. It was first known as LAV-300 A1. Gunnery trials carried out with the 105 mm gun were very successful. These trials included firing the gun at all angles of elevation and firing with the turret traversed 90 degrees to the vehicle‚Äôs centerline, the results of both being satisfactory. Mobility and firepower trials were carried out in late 1988 in Egypt as a potential customer. When production of the vehicle was reorganized and placed at New Orleans, its name changed from the V-600 to the LAV-600 in 1994. In 1989, the LAV-600 was reported to be considered by the US military as a candidate for the Armored Gun System program alongside Teledyne Continental AGS, FMC's CCVL and the IKV 91-105.The Return of the Gunned Tank Destroyer by First Lieutenant Steven R. Witkowski, pages 23-24. Armor: Volume 98, Issue 2. In 1999, the LAV-300 was considered alongside the LAV-600 to be selected for the US Army's Brigade Combat Team. The M1117 was chosen instead. Due to this, Textron decided to discontinue marketing in 2000. In 2010, Federal Defense Industries announced that they entered into an agreement with Textron Marine & Land Systems in order to provide authorized aftermarket parts, support and other types of assistance for the LAV-600 since FDI maintains a technical library for spare parts. ==Design== The LAV-600 uses many components of the LAV-300, and also several improved components, including heavier armor, better vision devices and weapons. The vehicle is manned by a four-man crew, consisting of a driver, loader, gunner and commander. Powered by a turbocharged 6CTA 8.3 diesel engine providing a power output of , the LAV-600 includes an Allison fully automatic transmission with six forward gears. The vehicle can travel at a maximum speed of 100 km/h, and has a range of 600 km. It has a weight of 18,500 kgs with a length of 6.30 m, a width of 2.667 m and a height of 2.74 m. Inclusion of low observable technologies for reconnaissance operations are also supported, such as minimization of infrared signatures, acoustic signatures and seismic signatures. A Halon fire detection and suppression system can be used for the vehicle. The LAV-600 is designed to allow it to be air-transported using C-130 Hercules aircraft. ===Armament=== The complete power operated, low recoil force gun turret of the Stingray light tank is used on the LAV-600. This incorporates a BAE Systems RO Defence 105 mm M-68 gun (L7) as the primary weapon of the LAV-600. A computerized fire control system is used for this weapon, with the power operated winch mounted at the front of the hull. The gunner's sight has a Optic-Electronic M36E1 day/night sight, which can be optionally replaced with the M36E1 SIRE day/night sight incorporating an integral laser rangefinder or an unspecified thermal sight. The turret has a traverse arc of 360 degrees. As the auxiliary weapon, it is fitted with a FN M240 machine gun. This can be replaced by a 12.7 mm M2 HB machine gun and another mounted on the roof. 16 smoke grenades are carried for Peak Engineering Number 12 smoke grenade launchers mounted on each side of the turret. ===Protection=== The hull and turret are of welded cadloy armored steel which provides protection against hits from up to 7.62 mm ammunition and artillery shell splinters. The vehicle‚Äôs armor can withstand impacts from up to 7.62mm ammunition and offers protection against land mines and fragmentation hand grenades. Armor plates can be fitted on to the hull for additional protection against ballistic impacts. ===Equipment=== Optionally, run-flat inserts can be used on the tires with a central tire pressure system. The LAV-600 features an optional nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protection system. ==See also== * M1128 Mobile Gun System ==References== Category:Armored fighting vehicles of the United States Category:Fire support vehicles Category:Six-wheeled vehicles ","title":"LAV-600"},{"id":"19311526","text":"Isaac Asimov Presents The Great SF Stories 19 (1957) is the nineteenth volume of Isaac Asimov Presents The Great SF Stories, which is a series of short story collections, edited by Isaac Asimov and Martin H.

Theater productions are presented at The Armory in Portland's Pearl District. Portland Center Stage at The Armory was founded in 1988 as the northern sibling of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon. It became an independent theater in 1993 and in 1994 Elizabeth Huddle became producing artistic director. Chris Coleman took over in 2000 as the company's fourth artistic director. In 2018, Marissa Wolf was named the fifth artistic director and Cynthia Fuhrman named Managing Director. The company began a capital campaign in 2004, and in 2006 moved into The Armory, which includes two theaters, a bar and restaurant, a costume shop, production facilities and office space. Portland Center Stage at The Armory produces at least ten productions annually between September and June, and productions include musicals, classical, contemporary and premiere pieces. Portland Center Stage at The Armory has received positive commentary in regional guidebooks including Best Places Northwest, Best Places Portland and Moon Handbooks Oregon. ==History1988‚Äì2000=== Portland Center Stage was founded in 1988, and was the \\"northern sibling\\" of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival (OSF) in Ashland, Oregon, and continued as a branch of OSF until 1994. The company was originally known as \\"Oregon Shakespeare Festival Portland\\". Its first production was Heartbreak House. Dennis Bigelow was PCS's first artistic director and was let go by the OSF in 1992. A two-year transitional process began in 1993, during which the OSF maintained a supervisory role over PCS. The Oregonian reported that the OSF's artistic director Henry Woronicz \\"couldn't figure out how to integrate the two closely enough for his liking, and he was unwilling to have Portland go its own way without supervision\\". The advisory board for Oregon Shakespeare Festival Portland was reformulated as the board of directors of the PCS, and Elizabeth Huddle was hired in May 1994 as the producing artistic director. Huddle had previously served on the PCS's search committee for a new artistic director, but decided to put her name in for consideration. In 1994 the PCS had a budget of US$2.2 million, and over 11,000 subscribers. In May 1995 the company's financial numbers for its transitional 1994‚Äì1995 period with its new artistic director were reported to be a deficit of $240,000. The company experienced what The Oregonian described as a \\"jarring divorce\\" from the OSF. Huddle had been on the 1991 search committee for the OSF's artistic director Henry Woronicz, but he suddenly announced his resignation in June 1995 effective the following October citing \\"personal reasons\\". Huddle and the rest of the theater community were surprised by Woronicz's resignation. In 2000 PCS board president Julie Vigeland commented to The Seattle Times that after separating from OSF \\"it was a real challenge to form our own identity\\", but that Huddle \\"did a wonderful job helping us do that for the last six years\\". ===2000‚Äìpresent=== Its fourth artistic director Chris Coleman took over in May 2000, and recruited experienced actors to the company. Coleman had previously co-founded Actor's Express in Atlanta, Georgia, and was the artistic director there. Coleman initially signed on for a three-year contract. Before Coleman began as artistic director with PCS, the company was already the largest live theater production company in Portland. However, the organization was facing sporadic attendance at performances as well as financial difficulties, with a deficit at the end of 1999 of $700,000. In 2000 PCS had a deficit of $880,000 and a base of 10,000 subscribers. The financial position of the company later stabilized, and Coleman had a 2000 budget of $3.2 million to work with when he came on. A 2003 consultant's report, however, found that PCS relied more heavily on gifts and grants to fund its operations than its peers around the company. Coleman hired the Portland company Sandstrom Design to help with marketing. Sandstrom helped to improve the promotional materials of the organization, while Portland Center Stage modified the nature and style of its performances. Sandstrom Design produced a 56-page flyer that showed the performance schedule for the 2003‚Äì2004 season which was mailed to subscribers, potential customers, handed out at performances and placed around town. The promotional campaign stressed the unique qualities of a live theater performance as entertainment over television and film. PCS's productions were presented in the Winningstad and Newmark theatres in Portland through the 2005‚Äì2006 season. Portland Center Stage moved to the new Gerding Theater at the Armory beginning with the 2006‚Äì2007 season. Portland Center Stage began a $32.9 million capital campaign in 2004, with the goal of building a new theater complex in The Armory, a historic building in Portland. The company began usage of The Armory in September 2006. PCS received $150,000 from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in September 2006 for \\"renovations and upgrades to its facility\\", and an additional $500,000 as part of the \\"Portland Center Stage Armory Theater Energy Conservation Project\\". The theater facilities at The Armory include the 590-seat U.S. Bank Main Stage theater, the 199-seat Ellyn Bye Studio (a flexible black box theater), administrative offices, the Vigeland Rehearsal Hall and a costume shop. Ten or more productions are performed annually, from September through June. The company's productions include contemporary, classical pieces and modern premieres, in addition to a summer playwrights festival, JAW (previously known as Just Add Water/West). PCS has approximately 9,000 subscribers and an annual audience of over 150,000. ==Productions== When Elizabeth Huddle became producing artistic director in 1994, a production schedule had already been set by the OSF's Pat Patton. Huddle made changes to her first season's schedule and decided to direct the first play of the season Arms and the Man, instead of the previously scheduled play Jean Anouilh's translation of Sophocles' Antigone. Portland Center Stage was nominated for \\"Best Production\\" in the 1994‚Äì95 Drammy Awards which recognize excellence in Portland theater, for Arms and the Man. Huddle was artistic director for the world premiere of the play Comfort and Joy: A Play in Two Acts, which premiered at PCS on December 2, 1995. Huddle had commissioned playwright Jack Heifner to write Comfort and Joy, which was the first time that Portland Center Stage had ever produced a new play. Huddle ended her time with the Portland Center Stage company in January 2000. One of Huddle's final productions with PCS was A Christmas Carol, and her final production with the company was Bus Stop. Chris Coleman's first production after signing on with PCS in 2000 was the play The Devils by Elizabeth Egloff, based on the novel of the same name by Fyodor Dostoevsky. Theater critic Misha Berson of The Seattle Times described Coleman's choice as \\"an especially audacious departure for Portland Center Stage\\", though reviews in Portland media were mixed, it received a positive review in The Oregonian and from audience feedback. Other productions in the 2000‚Äì2001 season included Martin McDonagh's Irish comedy, The Cripple of Inishmaan, A Christmas Carol, Patrick Marber's Closer, and adaptation of Antigone, and the Northwest premiere of A New Brain by William Finn. Coleman opened the 2006, 2007 and 2008 seasons at PCS with musicals. He opened the 2006 season with West Side Story, and the 2007 season with Cabaret. Other productions in the 2007‚Äì2008 season included Doubt, a Parable, Twelfth Night, and Sometimes a Great Notion. PCS received a total of 12 awards at the 29th annual Drammy Awards in June 2008, including \\"Outstanding Production\\" for Twelfth Night. Coleman opened the 2008‚Äì2009 season with Guys and Dolls, which The Oregonian and Willamette Week described as a timely choice in light of the Great Recession. ==Reception== In her 2004 guide Best Places Northwest Giselle Smith wrote that PCS \\"offers excellent production values, whatever the play\\". In his 2004 book Best Places Portland, author John Gottberg wrote positively of Portland Center Stage, commenting: \\"Portland's leading professional theater company is on a par with the country's best regional theaters.\\" The 2007 guidebook Moon Handbooks Oregon notes that the company: \\"produces innovative and sometimes daring productions\\". ==References * Category:1988 establishments in Oregon Category:Culture of Portland, Oregon Category:Theatre companies in Oregon ","title":"Portland Center Stage"},{"id":"19311612","text":"This Present Wasteland is the ninth studio album by American heavy metal band Metal Church.

Barney, 113 U.S. 645 (1885), regards the Act of July 14, 1862, ¬ß 9, 12 Stat. 553, which imposes a duty, \\"On all delaines . . . and on all goods of similar description, not exceeding in value forty cents per square yard, two cents per square yard.\\" Held that the similarity required is a similarity in product, in adaptation to uses, and in uses, even though in commerce they may be classed as different articles; affirming Greenleaf v. Goodrich... The court found that it was competent to inquire of a witness in a suit to recover back duties paid under this clause of the act of 1862 whether the words \\"of similar description\\" is a commercial term, and if so what is its commercial meaning; but it was not competent to inquire whether the particular goods, alleged to have been improperly subjected to duty, were of similar description to delaines. It was contended in this case that the plaintiffs in error went further than was done and that they offered to prove that in commerce \\"Saxony dress goods\\" were not considered as of \\"similar description\\" to delaines. It is argued that this brings the case within what should be taken as an exception reserved in the former decision. The exception claimed is drawn from the following clause in the opinion: Undoubtedly the language of tariff acts is to be construed according to its commercial signification, but it will always be understood to have the same meaning in commerce that it has in the community at large, unless the contrary is shown. Swan v. Arthur, 103 U. S. 598. The most that can be claimed for the alleged reservation in Greenleaf v. Goodrich is that it would have been proper to inquire whether the phrase \\"of similar description\\" was a commercial term, and if so what it was understood by merchants and importers to mean. That, however, is not what was attempted in this case. The witnesses were asked in effect not what the words \\"of similar description\\" were understood among commercial men to mean, but whether the goods of these importers were known in commerce as goods of similar description to delaines. The effort was to put the opinion of commercial experts in the place of that of the jury upon a question which was as well understood by the community at large as by merchants and importers. This it was decided in Greenleaf v. Goodrich could not be done, and upon the point supposed to have been reserved in that decision, this case stands just where that did. The testimony offered was therefore properly rejected. The opinions of the collector of the port and of the board of official appraisers were no more admissible on this question than those of any other competent experts. The judgment was affirmed. ==See also== *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 113 ==ReferencesCategory:1885 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Waite Court ","title":"Schmieder v.

Larry Donald purchased Basketball Times in 1980. While running Basketball Times, Donald was cited 19 times by the United States Basketball Writers Association in its annual writing contest. In 1998, he was presented the Curt Gowdy Award by the Basketball Hall of Fame for service to the sport over his career. After Donald died of an apparent heart attack in November 2000, his wife Nanci continued to run Basketball Times. John Akers, the managing editor of BT from 2001‚Äì11, became publisher of Basketball Times in September 2011. Akers has won 19 USBWA writing awards. == Magazine features == ‚ÄòUnder the Radar‚Äô -- Done annually for the past five seasons, every projected Division I starter is run through an efficiency rating known as the \\"Larry Bird formula\\" - a plus/minus system of positive and negative statistics - and takes note of those players who jump out unexpectedly.

He was a Labor Party Member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1976 to 1981, representing the electorate of Blue Mountains and representing the electorate of Bathurst from 1981 to 1988 and again from 1991 to 1999. ==Private life== Clough was born to Michael \\"Gordon\\" Clough and Irene Clough (n√©e Smith) in Warialda, New South Wales on 22 October 1927. Although christened Ralph James he was known as \\"little Mick\\" after his father. Clough attended schools in Warialda, Granville, Hornsby and then St Patrick's College, Strathfield. ==Early years== After leaving school he followed his father's occupation and worked for the Postmaster-General's Department then Australia Post as a telegraphist and postmaster for a total of 34 years in New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia before entering politics. As a telegram boy during World War II, he was often an unwelcome sight, bringing bad news of loved ones. He served as a member of the Citizens Military Force from 1948 to 1964. In 1951, Clough, aged 24, married Doreen Frost and they had three children: Elizabeth, Peter and David. Peter Clough went on to play interstate cricket for Tasmania and Western Australia, and was inducted into the Tasmanian Cricket Hall of Fame. Having joined the Australian Labor Party in 1948, Clough stood unsuccessfully in the 1973 State election for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in the electoral district of Blue Mountains. He entered public office as an alderman on the Blue Mountains City Council from 1974 to 1979. ==New South Wales state political career== In 1976 Clough again contested the seat of Blue Mountains, this time winning the election and reversing the victory of the independent sitting member Harold Coates three years earlier. Clough was subsequently re-elected in the 1978 State election. In the 1981 State election, following an electoral boundary adjustment, Clough stood for election in the electoral district of Bathurst which he won defeating Country Party of Australia sitting member, Clive Osborne with a margin of 0.05%. He was subsequently re-elected to that seat in the 1984 State election. At the 1988 State election, Clough lost the seat to Liberal candidate David Berry. He contested the 1991 State election, regaining the seat from Berry. Clough retained the seat at the 1995 State election. He decided not to contest the 1999 State election and retired from public life. Former Lithgow Mayor, Gerard Martin, successfully retained the seat for Labor. Clough did not achieve a higher office during his lengthy parliamentary career. (He did, however, serve as Acting Chairman of Committees for a short time in 1997). Friends and colleagues recalled Clough as a tough fighter for his electorate. During his terms in office his achievements included Bathurst's Macquarie Homes retirement village. He was a strong opponent of privatisation of power stations, financial deregulation and cuts to local services. ==After politics== Following his retirement from politics in 1999, Clough and his wife Doreen operated the Coolawin Gardens Motel in Nambucca Heads. In 2002 Clough retired to Perth, Western Australia where he died on 12 August 2008 following a long battle with bowel cancer. ==References *Speeches in Hansard by Mick Clough Category:1927 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:People educated at St Patrick's College, Strathfield Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of New South Wales Category:20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"Mick Clough"},{"id":"19311924","text":"The Camel's Back is the third album by Psapp. \\"The Monster Song\\" was released as the album's first single on 3 November 2008 in the UK. \\"I Want That\\" was released as the second single in the UK on 30 March 2009.Psapp announce London show and new single At this time, no singles have been announced or made available for the US market. ==Track listingPersonnel== Psapp *Carim Clasmann *Galia Durant Additional personnel *Alessandro Antonio Palmitessa ‚Äì saxophone, \\"I Want That\\" and \\"Marshrat\\" *Bekah Nelson ‚Äì additional strings, \\"Part Like Waves\\" *The Elysium Quartett ‚Äì additional strings, \\"Part Like Waves\\" **Anna-Maria Smerd ‚Äì violin **Jana Mishenina ‚Äì violin **Gabrielle Kancachian ‚Äì viola **Felicia Meric ‚Äì cello *Chris Walmsley ‚Äì additional percussion, \\"Fix It\\" and \\"Mister Ant\\" *Shawn Lee ‚Äì unspecified noises, \\"Homicide\\" *Pete Norman ‚Äì mastering ==Alternate versions== *In addition to the bonus track listed above, the iTunes versions available in most regions outside of the United States include an exclusive 16-page booklet. *As with Psapp's The Only Thing I Ever Wanted, a two-disc promotional version was produced in the UK.

The small town of Cooyar is about halfway to Kingaroy in the South Burnett region. A plan to connect Kingaroy to the south via Cooyar did not eventuate and left Cooyar at the terminus of a branch line running from Oakey west of Toowoomba.Kerr, J. 'Triumph of Narrow Gauge' Boolarong Press 1990 It was opened on 28 April 1913 after previous stages to Kulpi and Peranga opened on 29 April 1912 and 4 November 1912 respectively. The line was partially closed beyond Acland on 1 May 1964, with the last segment closed on 8 December 1969.The Cooyar Branch Line Milne, Rod Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, July, 1996 pp195-205 ==Services== Mixed trains initially ran four times a week and were replaced in 1929 by a daily rail motor service to Toowoomba. The line connected the small towns of Acland, Kulpi, Peranga, Narko, Nutgrove, Wutul and Cooyar to the Queensland Rail western line at Oakey until 1964. This provided passenger and farm produce services not only to these towns but also to the surrounding townships of Quinalow, Maclagan and Evergreen. Coal was transported between Acland and Oakey, this portion of the branch line remained in service until 1969. A similar parallel branch line existed connected Haden to the Western Line at Kingsthorpe from 1910 to 1964. As the competing service of bullock carts gave way to motor vehicles rail patronage declined resulting in both services becoming uneconomical to maintain. With negligible track remaining the Oakey- Cooyar branch line could all but be overlooked as a fading scar on the landscape, it retains its significance however through the still intact Muntapa Tunnel. A feat of early Queensland Railways engineering achievement, the Muntapa Tunnel remains the only tunnel in Queensland to pass under the summit of Eastern Australia's Great Dividing Range. This tunnel was constructed with manual labour. It is now home to a colony of bats. The Oakey- Cooyer branch line is also of early surveying significance. Rail engineering practice of the period avoided the construction of tunnels, so significant surveying was undertaken to avoid tunnelling and to minimise rail gradients. The largest gradient of a line mandates a larger, more expensive loco or a de- rating of carrying capacity, both of which would result in a less economical service for the line as a whole. The Oakey-Cooyar branch line was repeatedly surveyed to arrive at its built route, which had a negligible gradient over its length, but which required the 300m tunnel. The low gradient required a devious route, particularly at Narko and adjacent to the tunnel. == References == * * * Queensland Historical Legal Collection ==External links== * Tunnel location on Google Maps * 1925 map of the Queensland railway system Category:Closed railway lines in Queensland Category:Railway lines opened in 1913 Category:Railway lines closed in 1969 Category:Darling Downs Category:1913 establishments in Australia Category:1969 disestablishments in Australia ","title":"Cooyar railway line"},{"id":"19312027","text":"Chan Kin-por, GBS, JP (; born 1954, China with family roots in Chaozhou, Guangdong) is a member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (Functional constituency, Insurance).Recipients of HKSAR Honours and Awards He is chairman of the Legco Finance Committee.The transformation of mild-mannered Hong Kong lawmaker Chan Kin-por into radical-baiting head of Legco's Finance Committee, SCMP, 16 November 2015 Known as 'KP', he grew up in a poor family in a squatter area in Wong Tai Sin, and didn't go to university, instead taking a job in the insurance industry.

He was the chief designer of the OKB-8 (later NPO Novator which currently bears his name) between 1946 and 1985 and the Doctor of Technical Sciences (AS USSR, 1966). He was awarded the Hero of Socialist Labour twice in 1966 and in 1985 and was the Laureate of the 1967 Lenin and 1948 and 1977 State Prizes. Lyulyev was educated at the Kiev Polytechnic Institute (KPI) from 1927 to 1933. In 1941, he was evacuated to Sverdlovsk with the factory and appointed Vice Chief designer of the 8th Factory (known as JSC MZiK since 1994). In the years of the Second World War the factory produced about 20 thousand artillery guns and their mountings and participated in the modernisation process of the 85 mm KS-1 gun, also organising the production of 85 mm D-5 guns and 100 mm D-10 guns for the SAUs (self-propelled artillery vehicles) SU-85 and SU-100. On June 25, 1945, Lyulyev was promoted to Chief designer of the Factory ‚Ññ8. 1945-1947 he developed the 85 mm zenith gun KS-18 and the experimental 100 mm zenith gun KS-19 in 1947, which became the prototype of the next generation zenith guns before the SA guided missiles came. He also started the development of 130 mm zenith gun KS-30. In 1947, he was also appointed a Chief designer of Sverdlovsk Machine-Building Plant ‚Ññ8, where he formed the Chief designer division (OGK) - later OKB-8 of the Ministry of Aviation Industry (translit. Ministerstvo Aviatsionnoy Promishlennosti, MAP) for the purpose of development of large caliber anti-aircraft artillery systems. In 1957, Lyulyec developed the most powerful KN-52 zenith gun. In 1958, OKB-8 decided to move to the development of anti-aircraft missile systems. Under his leadership those SA missiles were developed: * 3M8 (developed since 1958, in service since 1965), 3M8M, 3M8M1 (in service since 1967), 3M8M2 (in service since 1971) * 9M38, 9M38M1, 9M38M2 for the Buk missile system * 9M82 (in service since 1988) and 9M83 (in service since 1983) for the S-300V * 9M82M and 9M83M for the Antey 2500 SAM system * Ural SA missile * M-31 (KS-42, experimental, 1961) * KS-168 * KS-172 * 3M54 Biryuza * V-755 * countermissile 5Ya26 (experimental, 1963) for the S-225 * countermissile 53T6 (PRS-1) for the A-135 (in service since 1995) * countermissile 53T6M (PRS-1M, experimental, 1990th) * countermissile 51T6 (experimental, 1980th) * naval antisubmarine missile complex Vyuga (since 1960), complex RPK-2, naval missile 81R (in service since 1969), export variant called Vysota * target missile Virazh and Virazh-M on the basis of 3M8 –∏ 3M8M * countermissile PRS-1M * countermissile 45T6 * naval antisubmarine missile complex RPK-6 Vodopad (in service since 1981) * naval antisubmarine missile complex RPK-7 100RU (in service since 1984), export variant called Veter * naval missile Alpha (experimental) * naval missile RK-55 * antisubmarine missile UR-91R * submarine missile 3M14 * target missile Mirazh ==Awards== * May 12, 1941 ‚Äî Order of the Red Banner for the distinguished services in the field of the design of the new weapons for the Soviet Army (RKKA) and the Navy * June 5, 1942 ‚Äî Order of the Red Star for the design and development of the new weapon models * August 9, 1944 ‚Äî Order of the Honour Mark for the masterly implementation of the development and production of the new weapon types * July 9, 1945 ‚Äî Order of Lenin for the successful implementation of the State Defence Committee (GKO) orders for the production of artillery weapons for the Red Army * 1948 - USSR Stalin (State) Prize * June 1966 - Hero of Socialist Labour for the distinguished services in the Five Years Plan of 1960‚Äì1965 and the design of the new weapon types * 1967 - Laureate of the Lenin Prize * 1977 - USSR State Prize for the design of the new weapon types * March 1978 ‚Äî Order of the Red Banner for the distinguished services and personal contribution to the field of the design of the new weapons and equipment type and in case of the 70 years anniversary * March 1985 - Hero of Socialist Labour ==External links== *World-known scientists founders of scientific - pedagogical schools at National Technical University of Ukraine \\"Kiev Polytechnic Institute\\" website *https://web.archive.org/web/20071013072107/http://testpilot.ru/russia/novator/novator.htm Category:Soviet engineers Category:20th-century engineers Category:Russian inventors Category:Heroes of Socialist Labour Category:1908 births Category:1985 deaths Category:20th-century inventors ","title":"Lev Lyulyev"},{"id":"19312076","text":"Turning Point were a late 1970s fusion band from the UK.

Archaeological evidence allows us to date the arrival of the first humans to Costa Rica to between 7000 and 10,000 BC. By the second millennium BC sedentary farming communities already existed. Between 300 BC and AD 300 many communities moved from a tribal, clan-centric organization ‚Äì kinship-based, rarely hierarchical and dependent on self-sustenance ‚Äì to a hierarchical one, with caciques (chiefs), religious leaders or shamans, artisan specialists and so on. This social organization arose from the need to organize manufacture and trade, manage relations with other communities and plan offensive and defensive activities. These groups established broader territorial divisions to produce more food and control wider sources of raw materials. From the 9th century certain villages grew in size, and the latter-period chiefdoms of the 16th century came to develop greater social hierarchies and major improvements in infrastructure. ==Ancient historyFirst settlers=== The presence of humans in the Americas was a much later phenomenon than on other continents. The first humans are barely dated to around 40,000 to 50,000 BC, and it is suggested a later date. In any case, the concentration of ice over the continents during the last Ice Age caused the oceans to recede by about 120 meters (400 feet), allowing groups of hunters from northeast Asia to move eastward in pursuit of great herds of animals. They traveled to North America and settled there in several waves, and over the course of several millennia and through successive generations, the descendants of these hunters spread out throughout the Americas and her neighboring islands. There is archaeological evidence that places the arrival of the first humans to Costa Rica between 7,000 and 10,000 BC. In the valley of Turrialba sites have been found in areas where quarry and tradesman tools such as bifaces were manufactured. It is thought that these first settlers of Costa Rica belonged to small nomadic groups of around 20 to 30 members bound by kinship, which moved continually to hunt animals and gather roots and wild plants. In addition to the species that still exist today, their usual prey animals included the so-called mega-fauna such as giant armadillos, sloths and mastodons. ===Mesolithic Period=== Around 8000 BC climatic changes brought about the end of the last Ice Age. The increase in temperature caused substantial changes in vegetation and saw the extinction of the mega-fauna, through either the disappearance of the plants they consumed, excessive predation by hunter or a combination of both. The hunter-gatherers had to develop strategies to adapt to new conditions, and they continued by hunting smaller species such as tapirs, collared peccary and deer. The new wealth of tropical vegetation, moreover, helped them to survive through all times of year. It is thought that human groups remained small, about 30 to 100 members, organized in nomadic or semi-nomadic bands devoted to hunting and gathering. However, the knowledge of the local environment allowed them to plan their travels through different areas based on the periodic ripening of certain fruits and the growth of familiar plants (that would later form the basis of agriculture) as well as the availability of other resources. Along these familiar paths they could find temporary shelter under rock ledges, or establish outdoor camps with tapavientos (windbreaker walls based on the cipresillo tree) or other temporary structures. Tradesman work areas, campfire pits and other fragmentary evidence of life in these groups have been found in the Turrialba valley and in various spots around Guanacaste. The manufacturing of specialized tools for various activities continued, and artifacts from this era such as scrapers, knives and spear tips display differences in form and size relative to those of the mega-fauna hunters. ===Neolithic Period=== By 5000 BC it became common to farm tubers and corn, as well as cultivate fruit trees and palm trees. Agriculture emerged slowly, stemming from knowledge of the annual cycles of nature and the progressive domestication of familiar plants. This development occurred over thousands of years and coexisted with traditional hunting and gathering, but it afforded a certain amount of stability. To ensure subsistence of these groups there had to exist forms of collective work and property, as well as egalitarian relationships. Between 2000 BC and 300 BC, some communities of early farmers became egalitarian societies. The development of agriculture prompted changes in the relationship between humans and nature, and allowed them to feed many more people. Furthermore, the ever-growing dependence on agriculture compelled human groups to establish permanent settlements around agricultural fields. This led to stable villages of huts that had to be erected in clear areas of the forest. The agricultural system most likely employed was slash-and-burn: The forest would be cut with stone axes and spades then burned to prepare it for planting crops. Agricultural practices included vegeculture, semiculture or a combination of both. Vegeculture (cultivation of plants on stakes) came about by farming tubers (yucas, yams, sweet potatoes) and diverse palms and trees (avocados, nances), in combination with hunting and fishing. This activity was very stable, since it demanded few nutrients from the soil, rarely caused erosion and could be developed in hilly areas. By such means, societies based on vegeculture would change very slowly. In contrast to vegeculture, semiculture (cultivation of plants from seeds) had a greater effect on the environment, because it required more nutrients from the soil and caused greater erosion. In return, this system had a big advantage: it make food easier to store so that it could be made available all year, not just around harvest time. This led to larger societies where functions would be diversified. The primary semicultural activity was the production of corn, as well as associated plants such as beans and ayotes (a type of gourd related to the pumpkin). Throughout the 2nd millennium BC there existed in Costa Rica small, disperse villages, non-nomadic agricultural communities that used ceramic bowls and utensils, and tools made from wood, bone and stone for agricultural tasks and food preparation. The oldest of these agricultural village communities (2000‚Äì500 BC) has been found in the province of Guanacaste. More recent ones (1500‚Äì300 BC) have been discovered in the Turrialba Valley, the coastal region of Gandoca, the northern plains, Sarapiqu√≠ Basin, Barva, Herradura, the T√©rraba River Basin, the Coto Colorado River Basin and Isla del Ca√±o. ==Societal evolutionEgalitarian societies=== In the beginning, the social organization of these groups would've been of a tribal or clan-based nature, with egalitarian relationships between individuals and organizations, in clans or groups whose members were or would consider themselves to be descended from a common ancestry. Such ties would have served as a foundation for economic and political relations; the leadership would've been informal and ownership of goods would've been collective. However, agriculture, sendentarism and a broadening demographic would've prompted the formation of higher classes of society, and the advent of leaders who built organizations well-suited to manage food production and distribution, calm disputes and so on. Important figures such as the shaman (a kind of priest), physician and witch doctor would have overseen religious and spiritual life. ===Early chiefdoms=== With dependency on agriculture came the need for efficient territorial control, to ensure the availability of suitable farmlands and improvement of productive techniques. Soil depletion and the consequent necessity to rotate crops, as well as a steady increase in the population, also made it essential to expand a group's sphere of territorial dominance. Almost inevitably, this brought about the rise of armed conflict with other groups. Between 300 BC and 300 AD, many villager-egalitarian communities in Costa Rica moved from a tribal, clan-centric organization ‚Äì kinship-based, rarely hierarchical and dependent on self-sustenance ‚Äì to a villager-chief organization, with chiefs and elders, religious leaders or shamans, specialist artisans, people of hereditary power and so on. These chiefdoms likely arose from the need to organize production and trade, manage relations with other communities and plan offensive and defensive initiatives. These chiefdom groups in general established territorial divisions that were more strongly demarcated than those in tribal times, and were able to expand their geographical spheres of domination to produce more food and control expanding sources of raw materials (forests, quarries, etc.). These groups also developed trading networks with other communities and regions. Other villages grew and became centers of economic, political and religious power. Some studies refer to these new forms of organization as complex chiefdoms. The appearance of these types of chiefdoms also led to higher-level hierarchies, with principal villages and secondary towns. From around 300 BC there began to appear large villages with intrastructural works of various importance (foundations, roads and burial mounds), that indicate a certain centralization of authority and managerial capacity to mobilize communities for construction tasks. There might emerge a primary chief in the dominant village and as well as secondary chiefs in subordinate villages. Among the principal archeological testaments to this era, it is fitting to mention diverse housing sites in the Nicoya Peninsula, housing structures at the sites of Severo Ledesma and Las Mercedes ‚Äì and on the Atlantic side, other settlement ruins in Valle del General, as well as the Coto Brus, Coto Colorado and T√©rraba River basin. Several archeological sites in Guanacaste Province are linked to this period, particularly tombs covered in tons of stone. Similar funeral mounds have appeared in the canton of Grecia. In other places in the Costa Rican Central Valley and along the Pacific, archeologists have uncovered housing plots delimited with rounded edges, mounds, clay floors and roads. In the south Pacific region are the famous stone spheres of Costa Rica, whose purpose is still a mystery, though it is suggested that they may have been symbols of rank or territorial markers, or had an astronomical function associated with cycles of agriculture. There was a great development in the manufacture of objects made of jadeite or so-called \\"social\\" jade (green or off-white stones such as quartz, chalcedony, opal, serpentine, etc.). It is supposed that they were used as personal ornaments then later on in individual burial clothes, since most have been found at burial sites. Deep local tradition in jade-work (which began around 500 BC and continued until around AD 700 for the most part developed without external influence, although some pieces display features of Olmec and Mayan artisanship. Their motifs apparently had religious meaning. Burials from this period demonstrate the existence of rank and class, since burial offerings include artifacts made of jade and other green gemstones, ceremonial grinding stones, sceptre stones and elaborate ceramics. The number, quality and difficulty of obtaining these articles are a means of indicating the person's social rank. With the advances in agriculture and corresponding social changes, the most successful communities established social hierarchies based on economic and political criteria. Between AD 300 and 800, these chiefdom societies developmented internal social strata, with political and religious leaders, warriors, specialized artisans and farmers. The ruling class could fill functions such as distributors for communally produced goods, military leaders, crisis counselors and so on. In any case, they usually had access to goods that were especially valuable because they were difficult to obtain or manufacture; and they were distinguished from other natives by their prominent living quarters within the villages, as well as the more elaborate funeral rites and offerings their status afforded. ===Later chiefdoms=== From the 9th century certain villages grew in size and their internal design became more complex, giving rise to the era of late pre-Columbian chiefdoms which lasted until the 16th century. It is possible that more fruitful varieties of corn and other crops, as well as more perfected agricultural methods coincided with an increase in population, a deeper social hierarchy and stronger relationships between communities further down the social chain. In some villages the caciques or shamans promoted the infrastructure improvements that required the mobilization of immense work forces. There was a notable peak in the art of goldsmithing throughout the country. In addition there was an increase in the variety of domestic and personal goods, regional trade, alliances and territorial conflicts. At the start of this period, Mesoamerican cultural groups began to trickle over the Nicoya Peninsula, principally the Chorotega people, who subordinated, displaced or mixed with populations that had previously settled in the Nicoyan territory. These new peoples introduced changes in religion, burial rites, art and other aspects of life; as well as new domesticated animals such as turkeys. This period corresponds to habitation sites located in coastal valleys such as Nacascolo and Papagayo; and the flood plains of the Tempisque River and other important rivers. In addition there were other places that specialized in the salt extraction, providing a precious trading commodity, especially for groups that lived inland. Skill in multi-colored ceramic art reached an advanced level; new colors and styles became available to local ceramic artisans, clearly inspired by Mesoamericana. In the heart of Costa Rica populations became more concentrated in organized economic and political centers, that would form living and ceremonial groups. The most well-known archeological site of this kind is Guayabo in Turrialba, which contains raised mounds with walls of stone, access ramps and pedestals, as well as aqueducts, elevated platforms, circular and rectangular foundations, paved walkways and other structures. But others have been found in widespread places in the Central Valle, the Caribbean region and the northern plains. In this era there was a great development in stonework with volcanic rocks, to make tables, stone tablets, grinding stones and anthropomorphic figures (women, heads, shamans, warriors and so forth). In the south Pacific region have also been found great quantities of home foundations, roads, dump sites, plus funeral areas and mounds. These settlements were located in very fertile regions, bringing about the extensive cultivation of corn and cotton, and the use of palm trees (coyoles and royal palms) and fruit trees (guapinoles, nances, etc.). This was the height of sphere-making, as well as of stone artisanship in such works as animal figures, grindstones, grand anthropomorphic statues (which appear to represent important social figures) that featured smooth surfaces. There was and increase in goldsmithing with guan√≠n (low-grade gold) and tumbaga (gold and copper alloy) using hammering and thin-sheet techniques. Mineral deposits themselves were not exploited, as gold was extracted from rivers and copper from outcrops. ==Societal classification== When the Europeans arrived, Costa Rica was not a unified land but was inhabited by diverse peoples independent from each other, and whose respective cultures had many different levels of complexity and development. The traditional view that divides this territory between the Chorotegas, Huetars and Bruncas has been abandoned, since these names in fact only identified a small part of the nations that existed in Costa Rican proper at the time. In light of recent studies, it has become much more appropriate to identify two major principal areas: * The Intermediate Area (or Isthmo-Colombian Area), with Caribbean and South American influences * The Mesoamerican Area, a great cultural expanse that extends from Chiapas and the Yucat√°n Peninsula in present-day Mexico to the Nicoya Peninsula as well as its eponymous gulf There is no strict boundary, either cultural or political, between the Intermediate and Mesoamerican Areas, because there would've been frequent contact and transcultural exchange between both groups of people, over all the confluent areas. Even so, notable culture differences existed between them. Some peoples in the Mesoamerican Area, for example, were organized into societies that appear more complex than those of their contemporaries in the Intermediate Area, having legal institutions which, from a Western point of view, may have been more developed. On the other hand, in both regions it appears the prevalent system of law was exclusively or almost exclusively consuetudinary, based on custom rather than the rule of law. It is possible, however, that the indigenous Nicoyans preserved their legal codes by means of some writing system similar to those of other Mesoamerican cultures. Part of what we know about these societies is from reports and letters written by the Spanish conquistadors and missionaries, people whose training and mentality were borne of cultural norms very different from those of the indigenous societies, and whose view of them at times was distorted through prejudice, personal interest or mere ignorance. Such documents are not very numerous, and on occasion are superficial, fragmentary or very general; and talk about a very small number of the indigenous groups that existed. ==Mesoamerican Area== In the opening decades of the 16th century, most of the people inhabiting the Nicoya Peninsula and the vicinity of its eponymous gulf belonged to the Mesoamerican cultural area. Their presence has also been attested in the central Pacific region between the Jes√∫s Mar√≠a and T√°rcoles Rivers. These people spoke Chorotega, and this is why sometimes they are generically designated as such. Furthermore, in the vicinity of modern-day Bagaces, at the mouth of the San Juan River and the Sixaola River basin there were enclaves of groups with Mexican cultural roots who spoke N√°huatl. According to several documents from the second half of the 16th century, the Nahua colony in Sixaola had been founded by tributary groups sent by the Aztec emperor Moctezuma II, who were driven there during the Spanish conquest of Tenochtitl√°n and decided to stay there. The Nicoya Peninsula and gulf region were the first Costa Rican territories to definitively and lastingly submit to the dominion of the Crown of Castile, around 1520. The interest in these areas was strengthened by the erroneous assumption that it would allow communication between the gulf and Lake Nicaragua, and beginning in 1522 there was constant Castilian presence in the region. Much of the knowledge we know regarding the life of this region's inhabitants is derived from the chronicles of Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de Oviedo y Vald√©s, whose Historia general y natural de las Indias (1535) includes details from his meetings with the Nicoyan people in 1529. It is possible that many of their institutions and customs were similar to those of the Chorotegan indigenous communities that at the time inhabited the Nicaraguan side of the Pacific. Details of the latter, among those regions administered by friar Francisco de Bobadilla, were more numerously recorded by Fern√°ndez de Oviedo and other conquistadors as well as a few priests. The population of Nicoya was a political, religious and economic center, located a short distance from the modern-day city of this name. (In the middle of the 16th century, there were two other dependencies also known as Nicoya, one larger than the other.) In Nicoya would reside a high chief, who held that post for life and exercised political authority, and would carry out religious and ceremonial functions. It appears that there was prevalently a dynasty- elective system for chief succession. Fern√°ndez de Oviedo indicated that this priest had other principal vassals and horseman called galpones, who would accompany him and protect him, and be his court subjects and captains. It is possible that these elders, whom the chronicler describes as arrogant and cruel, represented the various tributary villages of Nicoya. Fray Juan de Torquemada wrote that the Chorotegan villages in the Gulf of Nicoya area organized themselves into four \\"provinces\\": two within the peninsula, Nicoya and Cantr√©n (Canjel); and two others on the west coast, Oroti√±a y Chorotega. Other sources mention Canj√©n, Diri√°, Nacaome, Namiap√≠, Nicopasaya, Papagayo, Paro and Zapand√≠, as well as the island of Pococi (today known as Isla Caballo). ===Social organization=== The Chorotega society was hierarchical, and in the upper social strata appeared chieftains, warriors, priests and elders of prestige known as huehues. The authority of the village chieftains was not absolute, since they shared it with the mon√©xico, a council of huehues elected monthly and in which there were possibly representatives of various clans and communities. The members of the mon√©xico were perhaps the same individuals previously mentioned as galpones ‚Äì since the buildings where the council met were known by that name (surely derived from the term \\"calpulli\\") ‚Äì that were assigned to a neighborhood, village or district among the indigenous people of Mexico. Fern√°ndez de Oviedo wrote: In some communities, the mon√©xico had the legal authority to elect or bring death to the chieftain or principal ruler. On the Chorotegan community of Nagrando (Nicaragua), Fern√°ndez de Oviedo wrote: For his part, the chronicler Francisco L√≥pez de G√≥mara indicates: It is possible that in Nicoya there existed a similar system. In each case, the governor had limited authority and needed to take into account the traditions and opinions of the community. In 1529, when Fern√°ndez de Oviedo recommended to Namb√≠, chieftain of Nicoya, that he put an end to certain rites of collective drunkenness, he received the following response: The mon√©xico also had the right to elect certain elders of prestige as counselors to the community. These elders, whose activities the Spaniards compared to the Christian confessional, had private consultations, made recommendations to someone who sought his help, and allotted such penances as sweeping the plazas or gathering firewood for the temples. Counselors who divulged the content of these consultations, and third parties who listened to them surreptitiously, were severely punished. These counselors, in contrast to custom among the priests, remained permanently unmarried. ===Laws=== It is not clear if the mon√©xico also had judicial functions. In his work Costa Rica, la frontera sur de Mesoam√©rica (Costa Rica, the southern border of Mesoamerica), the lawyer and anthropologist Ricardo Quesada L√≥pez-Calleja indicates that the chieftain would name experienced and capable elders as judges, whose rulings could not be appealed. Quesada also notes that in the case of bigamy, the counselor would dictate the sentence. The available data regarding the normative organization of the Chorotegan people indicate that from the point of view of Western jurisprudence, it was a system of minimal complexity based on precedence, with minor infractions and few sanctions. On the other hand, it is very possible that they had written norms. The chronicler Antonio de Herrera states that the Chorotegan peoples of Nicaragua had voluminous books of paper and parchment, where they recorded memorable facts and had their laws and rites depicted. Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de Oviedo y Vald√©s indicated that they possessed books of deerskin, where in red and black ink they recorded their deaths and inheritances. So, when there were conflicts or disputes, they could be settled with the opinion of the elders. At the beginning of the 20th century, as a result of a few archeological excavations on the island of Chira, a square book with hieroglyphics was found that was called el misal chorotega (the Chorotegan missal or prayer book); but it is unknown where this document was used. The sole reference known about this find is offered by the archeologist Mar√≠a Fern√°ndez Le Cappellain de Tinoco, who visited the island of Chira in 1935. In her article, \\"Chira, olvidada cuna de aguerridas tribus precolombina\\" (Chira, forgotten cradle of war-hardened pre-Columbian tribes), she relates the account of Fern√°ndez Le Cappellain of an islander who said: Family ties were very important. The organization of the Chorotegan family was fundamentally cognate or matrilineal. furthermore, according to Fern√°ndez de Oviedo, the Chorotega men were \\"very much commanded by and subject to the will of their women.\\" L√≥pez de G√≥mara says they were \\"valiant, though cruel and very subject to their women\\". Marriage between blood relatives was prohibited and incest was practically unknown. Marriage Marriage was monogamous and appeared indissoluble, except in the case of adultery or bigamy. Some chieftains and high-ranking people had concubines, but they were never considered legitimate wives. Customarily, marriage required a series of ceremonies. It began with the asking for a woman's hand, that was executed by the father of the would-be groom during a formal visit with the woman's parents. If the request was accepted, a date was set for the wedding celebration. The marriage vow was celebrated with great fiestas, to which the families, friends and neighbors of the coupe would come. Before the wedding, both bride and bridegroom would receive a dowry from their respective parents, which may have included, in accordance with a family's economic means, arable land, a dwelling, cocoa beans, jewelry, animals, fruits, etc. Lands and valuable pieces of jewelry were inherited by the couple's children. However, if one of the spouses died without the marriage bearing descendants, these wares would return to the control of the parents. The father had the authority to sell the children for sacrificial rituals. In Nicoya and Oroti√±a, the chieftains exercised droit du seigneur (right of the first night) or ius primae noctis upon request from the woman's family, so that it would be easier for her to find a husband. According to L√≥pez de G√≥mara, some native peoples of Nicaragua preferred to give their wives-to-be \\"to the chieftains who would break them, to be honored more or to rid themselves of suspicion or anxiety.\\" When Fern√°ndez de Oviedo reprimanded chieftain Namb√≠ for continuing to have several wives and continuing to spend many nights with virgin women despite being baptized, the Nicoyan chief protested: The wedding ceremony was carried out in the presence of the chieftain and the families of the engaged. The chieftain, with his right hand, would take the bride and groom by the middle and little fingers of their left hands, conducted them to a small house designated for carrying out wedding rites and there said to them: \\"See that you are good spouses and that you look over your estate, and that you always improve it and not let it be spoiled.\\" Afterwards, the couple would observe silence as they watched a sliver of ocote (native pine) burn. When that was consumed, the ceremony would be declared complete and the new husband and wife would retire into a room in the house to consummate the marriage. Wedding celebrations would start the following day, when the couple came out of the house and the husband announced before his friends and relatives that he had found the woman a virgin. This declaration would give rise to general rejoicing. In the event that the woman had been delivered to the husband-to-be as a virgin, but had already had sexual relations, she was returned to her parents' house and the wedding would be considered invalid. On the other hand, if the husband-to-be had known before the wedding that the woman was not a virgin, the marriage would be considered valid. Many men preferred to take women who were no longer virgins as spouses, and even those of licentious conduct. Also, references survive regarding a peculiar matrimonial practice of the Nicaraos, that may have also existed between the Chorotegans: A woman would engage in prostitution to obtain a dowry, congregate afterwards with her clients, ask that they build her a house within a certain time period and tell them that each one had to contribute. When the dwelling was finished, the woman would choose a husband from her among her clients, a party would take place and from then on she would be considered a good woman. It should be mentioned that prostitution, even without marriage as an end, was permitted; and Fern√°ndez de Oviedo states that the normal price for a woman's sexual services was ten cocoa beans. The chronicler L√≥pez de G√≥mara says that the women \\"before getting married were generally bad, and once married, good.\\" The Chorotegans also celebrated rites of collective catharsis, sometimes accompanied by human sacrifice and ritual cannibalism. During these rites, married women, as the principals they were, could have sexual relations with whom they wanted or those who paid them, without later being subjected to jealously or punishment. Under normal circumstances, however, a woman's adultery was punished by admonition, severe corporal punishment and expulsion from the home. Their relatives would insult her and not recognize her, and the community would consider her an impure, shameless woman. Male bigamy was punished by loss of property and exile. His legitimate wife could remarry, if she had no children through bigamy. If there were any, she could not marry again, but if she assumed the care of the children, she would have a right to the property from the bigamous relationship. The woman who married a man with full knowledge of the relationship's bigamous nature lost all of her property in favor of the legitimate wife. Whoever raped a woman was bound to the house where the offense happened, and his own relatives would have to support him until he paid for the crime with a certain amount of property. If he did not meet this obligation, he would become a slave to her family. If a servant had sexual relations with his master's daughter, both would be buried alive. Sexual relations between males were also sentenced to death by stoning. Economy As in other indigenous communities of Mesoamerica, ownership of arable land and agricultural work between Chorotegans had to be essentially of a collective nature. Quesada L√≥pez-Calleja indicates that land could not be sold and that parents conferred it to their children or to their relatives, if they lacked descendants, when they felt that their final hour had arrived. Fern√°ndez de Oviedo's references to the Chorotegans' deerskin leather book imply that some type of cadastre existed, though is possible that litigation over lands was not between individuals, but groups. Individual private property existed mainly with respect to personal property. Thieves were condemned to return stolen items to their rightful owner and to serve their victims to repay the damage, and remained bound to the victim's house until the debt was satisfied. If the victim received no compensation, the thief could remain in slavery. A similar situation could occur whenever a homicide was committed, since the criminal had to pay restitution for the wrongdoing with goods to satisfy the victim's relatives, or otherwise become their slave. The tianguez or market played a central role in the economic life of the Chorotega towns, for which commerce and labor practices of certain complexity had to exist. These markets were tended by women, men were not permitted to enter, except for young people who had never had sexual relations. Men who violated such prohibitions could be stoned, be sold as slaves or be sold as cannibal fodder. Presiding over the markets were judge-administrators elected once every four months by the mon√©xico, according to Fern√°ndez de Oviedo: Although barter played an important role in trade, Chorotegans used cacao beans as currency. Cases of counterfeiting appeared, where cacao would be extracted from beans and replaced with dirt. Crime The religion, language, customs and laws of the Chorotega gradually disappeared as a consequence of the Spanish conquest. diverse sources from the time of the Spanish domination praise the laws of the Nicoyans and their attitude with regard to the law. For example, in the second half of the 16th century, the cosmographer Juan L√≥pez de Velasco indicated that the natives of Nicoya were \\"loyal and obedient to justice\\", and at the beginning of the 17th century they were still remembered as being ruled by wise laws, that among them there did not exist punishments for patricide, matricide or regicide, because the Nicoyans believed that no person was capable of committing such crimes. The chronicler L√≥pez de G√≥mara recounts that among the natives of Nicaragua, which included the Chorotega, \\"there is no punishment for killing a chieftain, saying that this cannot occur. For his part, Friar Bobadilla reported that when he asked a native of Nicaragua what they did when somebody killed a chieftain, the informant responded that it never happened, \\"because the chieftain does not communicate with despicable people.\\" ==Intermediate Area== In the 16th century, the present-day territory of Costa Rica ‚Äì with the exception of the Nicoya Peninsula, its eponymous gulf and the Nahuan enclaves ‚Äì was part of the cultural region known as the Isthmo-Colombian Area, encompassing those territories occupied predominantly by speakers of the Chibchan languages. In addition, this cultural region included eastern El Salvador, eastern Honduras, Caribbean Nicaragua, Panama and northern Colombia. It is possible that in earlier eras, the Nicoyan region had formed part of this area, and that its original settlers had been displaced by Mesoamerican groups arriving from the north. The Intermediate Area of Costa Rica, upon the arrival of the Spaniards, featured much less cultural unity than the Mesoamerican Area. Numerous communities with different languages and customs lived there, though most languages spoken there belonged to the Macro-Chibcha language family. The culture of some of these groups, especially on the Atlantic side, had many elements similar to those of the Caribbean islands; but in other groups a South American influence was discernible. For example, in 1562 the town hall of the recently founded city of Castillo de Garcimu√±oz, located in the Central Valley, wrote to King Philip II that the natives of Costa Rica imitated Peruvian dress and contracting practices. In the 17th century, some natives of Talamanca still preserved the practice of counting numbers of people on ropes with different types of knots, analogous to the use of knotted straps by the Incan empire. Similarities can also be found between the customs of certain communities and those of Panamanian and Colombian native peoples. There were commercial ties, vassalages and alliances between many of the communities in the Intermediate Area of Costa Rica, but there was no sole authority in the entire territory; rather, a multitude of societies with different levels of complexity. In Spanish documents appear mention of a great number of native groups: Aoyaque, Burica, Cab√©car, Catapa, Chome, Corobic√≠, Coto, Guaym√≠, Huetar, Pococi, Quepo, Suerre, Tariaca, T√©rraba, Tice, Turucaca, Urinama, Viceita, Voto. However, references in this regard are too brief and imprecise to clearly identify the various ethnic groups or their specific characteristics. The names of locations and of the chiefs are also problematic, since they sometimes use two or more names for the same place or person, or the same name for a place and a chieftain. It is even suggested that this may have been due to a custom of changing the name of a place whenever a chieftain died, conferring upon it the name of the deceased. The Europeans took special note of the great linguistic diversity; even today, the indigenous languages that survive in Costa Rica have very different characteristics. There possibly also existed a great multiplicity of codes of conduct. However, the territory of the Intermediate Area was not visited by chroniclers such as Fern√°ndez de Oviedo and missionaries such as Bobadilla, and the data that exists regarding these peoples' religious and judicial lives is exceptionally scant, isolated and fragmentary. In the 16th century, it appears in the Intermediate Area that a scattered type of settlement prevailed, defined by the existence of hamlets composed of two or three very large, communal ranches, whose inhabitants cultivated the enclosed fields. Some sources indicate that in each dwelling lived \\"an entire family, clan or lineage.\\" Although in certain places like Guayabo there remain archeological testaments to the existence of larger settlements, there appears to have been a lesser tendency for communities to urbanize than in the Nicoyan region, perhaps because nomadic and seminomadic cultivation compelled these groups to slowly move around. In contrast to what occurred in other places in Central America, the Spaniards did not manage to find any population center large enough to qualify as a city. ===Social organization=== The towns in the Intermediate Area were found to be organized in chiefdoms both large and small, and in clans of common heritage. It is known of several groups that they were subordinate to others and paid tribute to their chieftain; on the other hand, it is very problematic to clearly fix the hierarchical line, because documentation is too vague and imprecise about particular aspects, and sometimes uses imprecise terms such cacique mayor and cacique principal (major chieftain and principal chieftain). In other cases it is difficult to determine whether relations between various groups was of subordination or simple alliance. In addition to the term cacique, the conquistadors use synonyms for principal chieftain such as taque, meaning \\"chief\\" or \\"he who rules\\" in Chibcha; ibux, which could identify brothers or sons of a chieftain, and uri meaning \\"master's son\\". Among the major chiefdoms that have been identified, perhaps one of the most well-known are those of: * Chief Garabito (whose indigenous name was possibly Guar-Abito, \\"the sentry of Abito\\"; the Diego de Artieda Chirinos and Ucl√©s agreement [1573] speaks of the province of \\"Guaravito\\" instead of Garabito) in the central Pacific region and part of the western section of the Central Valley * Chief El Guarco, whose successor Correque ruled over a territory that extended from the R√≠o Virilla to Aserr√≠ and eastward to Chirrip√≥ and Parragua Both appear to have had an important number of communities and groups under their control. Other chieftains, however, did not have subordinate ties with them. Although there are indications that certain communities had patrilineal dynastic systems similar to those of the Incas, most chiefdoms in Costa Rica were lifelong and of matrilineal heredity as in other parts of the Intermediate Area. In some communities this system must have been dynastic-elective; it was still this way, for example, in certain indigenous groups of Talamanca in the second half of the 19th century, according to American paleontologist William More Gabb: It is known that in some villages a woman could be the chieftain: In 1562, a Spanish captain who visited the Voto community was \\"well received by an Indian chieftainess of theirs and by her husband who ruled little among them.\\" The Costa Rican chieftains in the Intermediate Area had greater powers than those of Nicoya; for example, when Correque moved his residence from Ujarr√°s to Tucurrique, he brought with him many elders and gentlemen along with their sons, \\"because the place he wanted was settled and nobody contradicted him.\\" Garabito also appears to have enjoyed considerable authority. However, perhaps in other groups the power of the main chieftain over others was not absolute, but was rather exercised in concert with subordinate chieftains. In some communities, the effective authority of the chieftains must've been lesser still, as for example the writings of Gabb in the latter half of the 19th suggest regarding the natives of Talamanca: In most communities, the chieftain played roles of vital importance. He would channel productive activities, redistribute surpluses, solve internal conflicts and impart justice, manage relationships with other groups and perform functions akin to a priest. His person was almost always sacred; he would carry special clothing and insignias, and would be surrounded by attendants and servants, as in an elaborate protocol. The principal achievements of his life and his funerals were usually characterized by complex, solemn public rites. The social hierarchy depended in many ways on the chieftain's family relations, since a person's rank was determined by how far or close in blood relationship he was to the chieftain. Warriors and priests typically belong to the upper classes, and also had special clothes and insignias. In some towns, such as those of the Coctus and Cotos, there were female warriors known as biritecas. The Coctu biritecas captured Dulcehe, the sister of the Quepo chieftain Corrohore, who was freed through the intervention of the conquistador Juan V√°zquez de Coronado. As a proper name or nickname, \\"Biriteca\\" has been freely given to the first lady of the famous chieftain Garabito, as well as the aforementioned Dulcehe, who was later baptized as Do√±a In√©s. Garabito's biographer, Oscar B√°kit, points out how absurd these idenfiers were, saying: \\"Dulcehe was never nicknamed La Biriteca, as such a name would have been an insult to her, since it belonged to the very same women whom she had taken prisoner.\\" Military confrontations between the groups were frequent, and prisoners of war were sent to ritual sacrifice, even without the habitual cannibalism in Mesoamerican ceremonies. The missionary friar Agust√≠n de Cevallos, when he refers to the many indigenous groups in southwestern Costa Rica in 1610, states that they lived in constant war with each other, because they had to periodically sacrifice some people, \\"and when they have none, without sacrificing any from their nation, attack those of another [village] and those that they capture are sacrificed; and if they have any left, they sell them to other neighbors for the same.\\" The slaves would also be sacrificed for burial with chieftains or other members of the upper class. ===Laws=== Marriage The norms on family and kinship were based on a cognatic system, for which the relationship between a nephew and his maternal uncle was important. The family organization was based on matrilineal clans that were supposed descendants of a common ancestor and that sometimes identified themselves as a group with a common name ‚Äì for example, one taken from an animal. In certain indigenous groups of what are today the Talamanca, sexual relations between people of the same cognatic group were rigorously prohibited, which imposed requirements of exogamy: the men had to look for a wife in another clan. Violators of this rule were buried alive. An matrilocal system of residence prevailed; in other words, a man had to go away to live in the house of his parents-in-law. As a fianc√© or husband, he had to work to contribute to the communal sustenance of his new family; thus young women were considered \\"as advantageous property to their families.\\" If the husband ever be became ill, he would have to return to his parents' house; but if the sickness was caused by sores or lasted too long, or if the man were an idler, the woman would no longer readmit him. They did not recognize kinship through an agnatic line (i.e., via the father) and consequently sexual dealings were irrelevant between two people related by exclusively patrilineal bonds. In the Intermediate Area the prevalent system of marriage seems to have been syndiasmic, although it is not impossible that in some communities there had been monogamous forms of marriage. Polygamy, as among the Nicoyans, was reserved for chiefs and others in the upper social strata. A document from 1763 indicates: However, in the latter half of the 19th century, many men among the natives of Talamanca would have two or sometimes three wives, and the husband had his choice of a plurality of women. The word used today in the Bribri language of Talamanca to define marriage, which literally means \\"united hands,\\" symbolizes how simple the ceremony could be, if there was any. A German missionary stated at even at the start of the 20th century, there remained between these same Bribris a type of marriage with barely any formalities, but in which the mother of the bride played an important role: As with other matrimonial systems, in the Intermediate Area of Costa Rica the wife may have had a position in the family equal or even superior to that of the husband, as demonstrated in the case of the chieftainess of the Votos. She possibly also enjoyed greater sexual freedom that the Chorotegan woman, since groups of the Intermediate Area do not appear to have given importants to virginity and there were women who deliver themselves to those who solicited them. At the end of the 19th century, William More Gabb stated that between the natives of Talamanca, \\"when puberty arrives, it is the sign that they should get married, at least on the part of the young women.... I am certain that very few kept their virginity until marriage.\\" As is customary in sindiasmic families, there does not seem to have been a substantial difference between the positions of the male and female in regards to the dissolution of the marriage, as suggested by the customs that the native groups of Talamanca maintained at the end of the 19th century: \\"No formula is required to enter into marriage and it lasts for however long it is convenient to the husband and wife. In the case of infidelity on the part of the wife, or of undue cruelty on the part of the husband, they can be separated. Sometimes, if the woman becomes unfaithful, the husband whips her severely and perhaps returns her to her family, or the resentful woman abandons him. This separation last for one or two years, or may be definitive; but during that time, either of the parties can enter into new bonds and then the separation is permanent.\\" There are also indications that sexual relationships and living arrangements between men were permitted. With respect to a group from the Intermediate Area in Panama (which was strongly linked to the Costa Rican portion) Fern√°ndez de Oviedo write that homosexuals \\"are not rejected nor mistreated for it. Such men are not joined with other men without a license to what they have, and if they do, they are killed.\\" Economy In the Costa Rican Intermediate Area there must have prevailed collective systems of work and ownership of arable land, though there were positions of privilege for people belong to the upper social strata.

In certain settlements the existence has been confirmed of plazas that could have been utilized for redistribution of goods, as well as for religious rites. ==See also== *History of Costa Rica *Models of migration to the New World ==References== Category:History of Costa Rica Category:Cannibalism in North America Category:Pre-Columbian era ","title":"Pre-Columbian history of Costa Rica"},{"id":"19312158","text":"The Wildlands Network (formerly known as ‚ÄúWildlands Project\\") was created in 1991 to stem the tide of species extinctions that was being recorded across North America. Evidence that such extinctions were often exacerbated by a lack of habitat connectivity between existing protected areasSoul√©, M., & Terborgh, J. (1999). Continental Conservation: Scientific foundations of regional reserve networks. Washington: Island Press. resulted in the organization‚Äôs adoption of a primary mission focused on scientific and strategic support for creation of ‚Äúnetworks of people protecting networks of connected wildlands.‚Äù __TOC__ ==History== In 1991, Dr. Michael E. Soul√© envisioned a conservation group that focused on fieldwork, all based on sound science. Soul√© joined forces with David Foreman, Douglas Tompkins, and other conservationists, he formed the North American Wilderness Recovery Strategy. The name would later become simplified to the Wildlands Project, now known as Wildlands Network. The complete list of Wildlands Network's cofounders includes: Bill Devall, Jim Eaton, David Foreman, Mitch Friedman, Monte Hummel, David Johns, Roz McClellan, Reed Noss, Jamie Sayen, George Wuerthner. Since its founding, Wildlands Network has worked to simplify conservation terms in order for the public to understand them. The Wildlands Network has also helped universalize the language for conservation planning. The Wildlands Network has helped inspire many other conservation organizations across the world. ==Priorities and campaigns== As a demonstration of where large landscape-scale habitat connectivity in North America was most needed, Wildlands Network identified four ‚ÄúContinental Wildways‚Äù traversing the Pacific and Atlantic coastlines, the Canadian Boreal Forest region, and the ‚ÄúSpine of the Continent‚Äù between Alaska and Mexico.Foreman, D. (2004). Rewilding North America: A Vision for Conservation in the 21st Century. Washington: Island Press. Over the period of 2000-2006, Wildlands Network scientists and associated conservation organizations mapped six regional ‚ÄúWildlands Network Designs‚ÄùForeman, D., et al (2000).

(WNDs) within those corridors in the Rocky Mountain West and the Northern Appalachians. These conservation plans identified existing protected areas and proposed wildlife corridors that would connect them as pathways for wide-ranging (keystone) species in need of ‚Äúroom to roam.‚Äù The plans also described the various positive ecological impacts that these species had on other flora and fauna.Terborgh, J., & Estes, J. (2010). Trophic Cascades: Predators, Prey, and the Changing Dynamics of Nature. Washington: Island Press. In recent years, Wildlands Network moved from a focus on continued creation of WNDs to guiding implementation of the recommendations in the six existing plans. The organization developed a network of public and private individuals, groups, and agencies working in the regions covered by the WNDs to accomplish this goal. Initiatives currently focus on connecting habitat in the Western (Spine of Continent) and Eastern (Atlantic) Wildways. ==Current ProjectsEastern Wildway=== This proposed corridor would connect the Adirondacks, the Great Smoky Mountains, the Appalachians (including the Northern Appalachian Corridor), and the Everglades. It is made up of public lands, such as national parks and nature preserves. In order to have the greatest impact on migrating wildlife and threatened ecosystems, key areas of importance have been identified in the proposed corridor, known as the ‚ÄúEssential 16‚Äù. In 2015, the Eastern Wildway Network was formed in order to advance efforts in North America. Over 30 conservation leaders have partnered in order to aid the conservation efforts and introducing essential species back into the area, like wolves and cougars. The partnership serves to open more opportunities for the Eastern Wildway campaign to reach its goals. ===Western Wildway=== Also known as the Spine of the Continent Initiative, this is a proposed 6,000 mile swath that will stretch from the Brooks Range in Alaska, down the Rockies through Canada and the United States, to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. ===Pacific Wildway=== This proposal runs the length of the Pacific Coast from Baja, Mexico to where the Coast Range converges with the Rockies, where it connects to the Western Wildway. ===Boreal Wildway=== Also known as the Canadian Boreal Initiative, this proposal would encompass most of the 1.2 billion acre North American Taiga biome in Canada. This area is of particular importance due to its function as a carbon sink (with slower decomposition rates, the Boreal forest can sequester carbon more efficiently than its temperate and tropical counterparts, such as the Amazon Rainforest) and its large swaths of unaltered landscapes from coast to coast. ==On-the-Ground Campaigns== On-the-Ground campaigns are the current fieldwork campaigns that the Wildlands Network has committed to. ===Wild Cats Campaign=== Cougars, jaguars, bobcats, lynx, and ocelots are important to the natural cycle of the ecosystem. Their populations have dwindled due to hunters, trappers, and habitat loss. This has caused great ruin to the natural world. The Wildlands Campaign caters to each of these cats in their original habitats in order to foster the populations. Cougars Cougar populations have suffered due to human interference. Whereas cougars were once prevalent in Eastern North America, their populations have dwindled as a result of human interference. The Eastern North America decisuous region therefore could fail to regenerate because of the abundant populations of deer. The Wildlands Network focuses on two main goals in regards to the conservation of cougars. To push stronger policies for the protection of cougars in the Eastern U.S, and to continue the recovery of cougar populations in various wildland complexes. One of the main methods of carrying out these goals is to educate the public on the need for cougars. Jaguars Jaguars are the largest wild cats in the world, and once roamed from the southern US to Argentina. Jaguar populations are dwindling at an alarming rate due to rapid urban development. The Wildlands Network focuses on creating conditions for jaguars to migrate freely between the US and Mexico because this migration path is essential for their survival (see #Borderlands Campaign). One of the ways the Network is doing this is by advocating for wildlife crossing structures at key locations along Highway 2, which runs parallel to the US-Mexico Border. ===Borderlands Campaign=== The Borderlands Campaign's goal is to ensure that wild animals have access to all of the natural immigration pathways that they had long before humans colonized the land. Political boundaries are meaningless to animals, and the Wildlands Network attempts to help governments recognize that by campaigning for animal crossing bridges rather than walls. The Wildlands Network identifies core areas and habitat corridors essential for the natural immigration patterns of many species. There are currently three core areas in Northern Mexico that the Network is hoping to strengthen protections in. ===Red Wolf Campaign=== The Wildlands Network focuses on merging science and activism in order to protect the remaining red wolves in the southeastern United States. The red wolf is one of the critically endangered in the world. Only about 30-50 of them exist in the wild. The Network is trying to take measures on their behalf in order for them to survive. Red wolves are essential for keeping deer populations in check because deer are destructive to vegetation. Red wolves also help keep smaller animals in check, preventing them from overpopulating. The Wildlands Network is currently focused on three major campaigns to save the Red Wolves. Firstly, installing cameras in the areas where red wolves are known to roam, and releasing the footage to the public in order to show that wolves are not overkilling deer, but rather keeping their populations in check. Secondly, promoting political pressure on the United States Fish and Wildlife Services, which is the main U.S agency in charge of conservation efforts of Red Wolves under the Endangered Species Act. Thirdly, advocating for red wolves targeting the public such as through newspapers, presentations, and rallies. ==See also== * Conservation movement * Conservation biology * Rewilding * Habitat conservation * Habitat destruction * Habitat fragmentation * Environmental protection * Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act ==References== Category:Environmental organizations based in the United States ","title":"Wildlands Network"},{"id":"19312172","text":"Parpola is a Finnish surname.

The campaign, complicated in August 1884 by the outbreak of the Sino-French War and in July 1885 by the C·∫ßn V∆∞∆°ng nationalist uprising in Annam (central Vietnam), which required the diversion of large numbers of French troops, was conducted by the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps, supported by the gunboats of the Tonkin Flotilla. The campaign officially ended in April 1886, when the expeditionary corps was reduced in size to a division of occupation, but Tonkin was not effectively pacified until 1896. ==Hanoi and Nam ƒê·ªãnh (June‚ÄìJuly 1883)== Nine years after Francis Garnier's failed attempt to conquer Tonkin, French and Vietnamese troops clashed in Tonkin on 25 April 1882, when Commandant Henri Rivi√®re seized the citadel of Hanoi with a small force of marine infantry.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 140‚Äì44 After a lull of several months, the arrival of reinforcements from France in February 1883 allowed Rivi√®re to mount a campaign to capture the citadel of Nam ƒê·ªãnh (27 March 1883). The Capture of Nam ƒê·ªãnh was strategically necessary for the French, to secure their communications with the sea.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 149‚Äì50 During Rivi√®re's absence at Nam ƒê·ªãnh with the bulk of his forces, chef de bataillon Berthe de Villers defeated a Vietnamese attack on the French positions at Hanoi by Prince Ho√†ng K·∫ø Vi√™m at the Battle of Gia Cuc (27 and 28 March 1883).Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 150‚Äì51 Although these early actions deserve to be considered part of the Tonkin campaign, the campaign is conventionally considered to have begun in June 1883, in the wake of the decision by the French government to despatch reinforcements to Tonkin to avenge Rivi√®re's defeat and death at the hands of Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army at the Battle of Paper Bridge on 19 May 1883. These reinforcements were organised into a Tonkin Expeditionary Corps, which was placed under the command of g√©n√©ral de brigade Alexandre-Eug√®ne Bou√´t (1833‚Äì87), the highest-ranking marine infantry officer available in the French colony of Cochinchina.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 158‚Äì62 The French position in Tonkin on Bou√´t's arrival in early June 1883 was extremely precarious. The French had only small garrisons in Hanoi, Haiphong and Nam ƒê·ªãnh, isolated posts at Hon Gai and at Qui Nh∆°n in Annam, and little immediate prospect of taking the offensive against Liu Yongfu's Black Flags and Prince Ho√†ng K·∫ø Vi√™m's Vietnamese.Duboc, 139‚Äì51; Huard, 83‚Äì4; Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 59‚Äì60 Bou√´t's first step was to withdraw the isolated French garrisons of Qui Nh∆°n and Hon Gai. He had also been authorised to abandon Nam ƒê·ªãnh at need, but he decided to try to defend all three major French posts. During June, the French dug in behind their defences and beat off half-hearted Vietnamese demonstrations against Hanoi and Nam ƒê·ªãnh.Huard, 84‚Äì8 Combat of Nam ƒê·ªãnh, 19 July 1883. The early arrival of reinforcements from France and New Caledonia and the recruitment of Cochinchinese and Tonkinese auxiliary formations allowed Bou√´t to hit back at his tormentors. On 19 July chef de bataillon Pierre de Badens, the French commandant sup√©rieur at Nam ƒê·ªãnh, attacked and defeated Prince Ho√†ng K·∫ø Vi√™m's besieging Vietnamese army, effectively relieving Vietnamese pressure on Nam ƒê·ªãnh.Duboc, 156‚Äì7; Huard, 88‚Äì92 ==Establishment of the French protectorate (August 1883)== Courbet and Harmand at Hu·∫ø, August 1883 The arrival of Admiral Am√©d√©e Courbet in Ha Long Bay in July 1883 with substantial naval reinforcements further strengthened the French position in Tonkin. Although the French were now in a position to consider taking the offensive against Liu Yongfu, they realised that military action against the Black Flag Army had to be accompanied by a political settlement with the Vietnamese court at Hu·∫ø, if necessary by coercion, that recognised a French protectorate in Tonkin. On 30 July 1883 Admiral Courbet, General Bou√´t and Fran√ßois-Jules Harmand, the recently appointed French civil commissioner-general for Tonkin, held a council of war at Haiphong. The three men agreed that Bou√´t should launch an offensive against the Black Flag Army in its positions around Phu Hoai on the Day River as soon as possible. They also noted that the Court of Hu·∫ø was covertly aiding and abetting Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army, and that Prince Ho√†ng was still in arms against the French at Nam ƒê·ªãnh. They therefore decided, largely on Harmand's urging, to recommend to the French government a strike against the Vietnamese defences of Hu·∫ø, followed by an ultimatum requiring the Vietnamese to accept a French protectorate over Tonkin or face immediate attack.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 162‚Äì3 The proposal was approved by the navy ministry on 11 August, and on 18 August several warships of Courbet's Tonkin Coasts naval division bombarded the Thu·∫≠n An forts at the entrance to the Hu·∫ø River. On 20 August, in the Battle of Thu·∫≠n An, two companies of French marine infantry and the landing companies of three French warships went ashore and stormed the forts under heavy fire. During the afternoon the gunboats Lynx and Vip√®re forced a barrage at the entrance to the River of Perfumes, enabling the French to attack Hu·∫ø directly if they chose.Huard, 103‚Äì22; Loir, 13‚Äì22; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 165‚Äì6; Histoire militaire, 62‚Äì4 Signature of the Treaty of Hu·∫ø, 25 August 1883 The Vietnamese asked for an armistice, and on 25 August Harmand dictated the Treaty of Hu·∫ø to the cowed Vietnamese court. The Vietnamese recognised the legitimacy of the French occupation of Cochinchina, accepted a French protectorate both for Annam and Tonkin and promised to withdraw their troops from Tonkin. Vietnam, its royal house and its court survived, but under French direction. France was granted the privilege of stationing a resident-general at Hu·∫ø, who would work to the civil commissioner-general in Tonkin and could require a personal audience with the Vietnamese emperor. To ensure there were no second thoughts, a permanent French garrison would occupy the Thu·∫≠n An forts. Large swathes of territory were also transferred from Annam to Tonkin and the French colony of Cochinchina. The French cancelled the country's debts, but required in return the cession of the southern province of B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n, which was annexed to Cochinchina. At the same time the northern provinces of Ngh·ªá An, Thanh H√≥a and H√† Tƒ©nh were transferred to Tonkin, where they would come under direct French oversight. In return the French undertook to drive out the Black Flags from Tonkin and to guarantee freedom of commerce on the Red River.Huard, 122‚Äì30; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 166 ==Ph·ªß Ho√†i, Palan and H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng (August‚ÄìNovember 1883)== The capture of Haiduong, 13 August 1883 Meanwhile, as agreed at the Haiphong conference, General Bou√´t duly took the offensive against Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army. Bou√´t twice attacked the Black Flags in their defences along the Day River, in the Battle of Ph·ªß Ho√†i (15 August 1883) and the Battle of Palan (1 September 1883). These offensives met with only limited success, and in the eyes of the world were tantamount to French defeats.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 162‚Äì5 and 166‚Äì7 More encouragingly for the French, a column of marine infantry and Cochinchinese riflemen under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Brionval stormed the Vietnamese defences of H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng on 13 August. The capture of Haiduong was notable for atrocities committed by both the French and the Vietnamese. The French discovered, hung up by hooks from the city walls, the mutilated bodies of several missing French and Vietnamese soldiers of the expeditionary corps. The dead soldiers had clearly been tortured to death, and the French took their revenge by bayoneting the Vietnamese wounded. The capture of H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng secured the French line of communication by river between Hanoi and Haiphong. The French occupied the citadel of H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng and also established a post a few kilometres to the north of the town, at Elephant Mountain.Huard, 98‚Äì9 The occupation of Qu·∫£ng Y√™n, November 1883 In November 1883 the French further strengthened their grip on the Delta by occupying the towns of Ninh B√¨nh, H∆∞ng Y√™n and Qu·∫£ng Y√™n. The allegiance of Ninh B√¨nh was of particular importance to the French, as artillery mounted in its lofty citadel controlled river traffic to the Gulf of Tonkin. Although the Vietnamese governor of Ninh B√¨nh had made no attempt to hinder the passage of the expedition launched by Henri Rivi√®re in March 1883 to capture Nam ƒê·ªãnh, he was known to be hostile towards the French. Accordingly, Lieutenant-Colonel Pierre de Badens (1847‚Äì97) was sent to occupy Ninh B√¨nh with a company of marine infantry, supported by the gunboats L√©opard and Pluvier. Cowed by the silent menace of the gunboats, the Vietnamese handed over the citadel of Ninh B√¨nh without resistance, and the French installed a garrison there.Huard, 98‚Äì9 The Treaty of Hu·∫ø remained a dead letter in Tonkin. Vietnamese mandarins sent to Tonkin to support French administration there were sullen and uncooperative, and Prince Hoang declined to withdraw Vietnamese forces from Tonkin. Meanwhile, the Black Flags, with Prince Hoang's active encouragement, stepped up their attacks on French posts during the autumn of 1883. The small French garrisons in Palan and Batang were harassed, and on 17 November the French post at H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng was attacked and nearly overwhelmed by a force of 2,000 Vietnamese insurgents. Only the timely arrival of the gunboat Lynx enabled the defenders to hold their positions.Huard, 171‚Äì9; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 167‚Äì8; Histoire militaire, 66‚Äì8 == S∆°n T√¢y (December 1883) == S∆°n T√¢y, 16 December 1883 In December 1883 the French took their revenge. Admiral Am√©d√©e Courbet, who had replaced Bou√´t in command of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps two months earlier, assembled a column of 9,000 men and marched on S∆°n T√¢y for a showdown with Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army. The decision was of considerable political significance, as an attack on S∆°n T√¢y would bring the French into direct conflict with Chinese troops for the first time in the campaign. China, the traditional overlord of Vietnam, had for months been covertly supporting the Black Flags, and had stationed Chinese troops in S∆°n T√¢y, L·∫°ng S∆°n, B·∫Øc Ninh and other Tonkinese towns to limit French freedom of movement. The French government appreciated that an attack on S∆°n T√¢y would probably result in an undeclared war with China, but calculated that a quick victory in Tonkin would force the Chinese to accept a fait accompli. On 10 December 1883, after the failure of diplomatic efforts to persuade the Chinese to withdraw their troops, the French government authorised Courbet to attack S∆°n T√¢y.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 146‚Äì7 and 167‚Äì8 The S∆°n T√¢y campaign was the fiercest campaign the French had yet fought in Tonkin. Although the Chinese and Vietnamese contingents at S∆°n T√¢y played little part in the defence, Liu Yongfu's Black Flags fought ferociously to hold the city. On 14 December the French assaulted the outer defences of S∆°n T√¢y at Phu Sa, but were thrown back with heavy casualties. Hoping to exploit Courbet's defeat, Liu Yongfu attacked the French lines the same night, but the Black Flag attack also failed disastrously. After resting his troops on 15 December, Courbet again assaulted the defences of S∆°n T√¢y on the afternoon of 16 December. This time the attack was thoroughly prepared by artillery, and delivered only after the defenders had been worn down. At 5 p.m. a Foreign Legion battalion and a battalion of marines captured the western gate of S∆°n T√¢y and fought their way into the town. Liu Yongfu's garrison withdrew to the citadel, and evacuated S∆°n T√¢y under cover of darkness several hours later. Courbet had achieved his objective, but at considerable cost. French casualties at Sontay were 83 dead and 320 wounded. The fighting at S∆°n T√¢y also took a terrible toll of the Black Flags, and in the opinion of some observers broke them once and for all as a serious fighting force.Huard, 180‚Äì7 and 202‚Äì31; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 171‚Äì7; Histoire militaire, 68‚Äì72 ==B·∫Øc Ninh and H∆∞ng H√≥a (January‚ÄìJuly 1884)== Turcos and Fusiliers de Marine at B·∫Øc Ninh On 16 December 1883, the very day on which he captured S∆°n T√¢y, Admiral Courbet was replaced in command of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps by g√©n√©ral de division Charles-Th√©odore Millot, as a result of the despatch of strong reinforcements to Tonkin in November 1883 and the consequent expansion of the expeditionary corps into a two-brigade army division. Although the capture of S∆°n T√¢y paved the way for the eventual French conquest of Tonkin, the French now had to deal with opposition from China as well as the Black Flag Army. Having exhausted diplomatic efforts to persuade the Chinese to withdraw their armies from Tonkin, the French government sanctioned an attack by Millot on the fortress of B·∫Øc Ninh, occupied since the autumn of 1882 by China's Guangxi Army. In March 1884, in the B·∫Øc Ninh campaign, Millot routed the Guangxi Army and captured B·∫Øc Ninh. Millot put just over 11,000 French, Algerian and Vietnamese soldiers into the field at B·∫Øc Ninh, the largest concentration of French troops ever assembled in the Tonkin campaign.Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 75‚Äì80 French marine infantrymen in Tonkin, 1884 Millot followed up his victory by mopping up scattered Chinese garrisons left behind by the Guangxi Army after the rout at B·∫Øc Ninh and by mounting a major campaign against Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army, which had retreated to H∆∞ng H√≥a. On 11 April 1884 Millot captured H∆∞ng H√≥a and Dong Yan, flanking the Black Flag Army and its Vietnamese allies out of a formidable defensive position without losing a man.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 186‚Äì7 The Black Flag Army retreated westwards up the Red River to Thanh Quan, while Prince Hoang Ke Viem's Vietnamese forces fell back southwards from Dong Yan towards the Annam-Tonkin border, making for the sanctuary of the province of Thanh H√≥a, where the French had not yet installed any garrisons. Millot despatched Lieutenant-Colonel Letellier with two Turco battalions and supporting cavalry to harry Liu Yongfu's retreat, and sent General Bri√®re de l'Isle with the rest of the 1st Brigade in pursuit of Prince Hoang. In early May Bri√®re de l'Isle cornered Prince Hoang in Phu Ngo, several kilometres to the northwest of Ninh B√¨nh, but the French government forbade him to attack the Vietnamese defences, having just received news that China was ready to treat with France over the future of Tonkin.Huard, 286‚Äì90 Elsewhere, though, the French kept up the pressure. On 11 May chef de bataillon Reygasse attacked the Chinese garrison of Th√°i Nguy√™n and drove it out.Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 85‚Äì7 In the same week the landing companies of Admiral Courbet's Tonkin Coasts naval division exterminated nests of Vietnamese pirates along the coast of the Gulf of Tonkin around Dam Ha and Ha Coi.Loir, 29‚Äì35 The B·∫Øc L·ªá ambush, 23 June 1884 On 11 May 1884, the same day as French and Chinese forces clashed at Th√°i Nguy√™n, France and China concluded the Tientsin Accord. This treaty provided for the immediate evacuation of Tonkin by the Chinese armies, and the implicit recognition by China of the French protectorate over Tonkin (the Chinese agreed to recognise all treaties concluded between France and Annam, including the 1883 Treaty of Hu·∫ø which formalised the French protectorate in Tonkin).Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 189‚Äì93 The conclusion of the Tientsin Accord allowed the French to consolidate their hold on the Delta in May and June 1884. By the end of June the French had established forward bases at H∆∞ng H√≥a, Tuy√™n Quang, Phu Lang Thuong and Th√°i Nguy√™n. These posts, together with the bases established further to the east at H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng and Qu·∫£ng Y√™n the previous autumn, formed a cordon that enclosed most of the Delta. Behind this chain of frontline posts the French were strongly entrenched in S∆°n T√¢y, Hanoi, Nam ƒê·ªãnh, Ninh B√¨nh, B·∫Øc Ninh and Sept Pagodes. It only remained for them to occupy L·∫°ng S∆°n and the other fortresses of northern Tonkin once they were evacuated by the Chinese under the terms of the Tientsin Accord.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 187‚Äì9 In theory, the Tientsin Accord should have resolved the confrontation between France and China in Tonkin, but a clash between French and Chinese troops at Bac Le on 23 June 1884 plunged both countries into a fresh crisis. China's refusal to pay an indemnity for the B·∫Øc L·ªá ambush led two months later to the outbreak of the Sino-French War (August 1884‚ÄìApril 1885).Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 193‚Äì6 ==The Sino- French War (August 1884‚ÄìApril 1885)== Tonkinese villagers were expected to show their respect by kowtowing to passing French columns The outbreak of the Sino-French War in August 1884 complicated and considerably retarded the French timetable for the conquest of Tonkin, and initially placed the French on the defensive against an invasion of the Delta by the Chinese armies. In September 1884 General Millot resigned as general-in-chief of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps and was replaced by his senior brigade commander, Louis Bri√®re de l'Isle. Revealingly, Millot's final order of the day to the soldiers of the expeditionary corps contained a warning against growing French arrogance. By now there were more than 20,000 French soldiers serving in Tonkin, and many of them were beginning to treat the local population with contempt. Tonkinese villagers, for example, were expected to kowtow if a French column passed by. Millot saw that this attitude was stirring up trouble for the future, and issued a prescient warning: > Je n'ai plus qu'un conseil √† vous donner : soyez pour mon successeur, le > g√©n√©ral Bri√®re de l'Isle, ce que vous avez √©t√© pour moi, et n'oubliez pas > surtout que votre pr√©sence dans le pays sera d'autant plus facilement > accept√©e que vous perdrez moins de vue les tendances et les aspirations des > laborieuses populations qui l'habitent.Huguet, 18‚Äì19 > (I have only one word of advice to give you. Be to my successor, General > Bri√®re de l'Isle, what you have been to me. Above all, never forget that > your presence in this country will be all the more easily accepted the more > you bear in mind the customs and aspirations of the hard-working peoples > that inhabit it.) Bri√®re de l'Isle was a natural leader of men, and under his command the expeditionary corps achieved a high standard of professional excellence. One of his first acts as general-in-chief, in September 1884, was to seal off Tonkin from Annam by ejecting Vietnamese bandit concentrations from the border towns of My Luong, Ke Son and Phu Ngo and establishing French posts there. This stroke secured the French rear and allowed the expeditionary corps to concentrate substantial forces against the expected Chinese invasion.Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 94‚Äì6 The battle of K√©p, 8 October 1884 In October 1884 General Fran√ßois de N√©grier defeated a major Chinese invasion of the Tonkin Delta in the K√©p campaign. This campaign brought French troops into the hitherto-unexplored Luc Nam valley, and at the close of the campaign the French occupied the villages of Chu and K√©p, which were converted into forward bases for an eventual campaign against L·∫°ng S∆°n.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 234‚Äì7 In the western Delta, where their advanced post of Tuy√™n Quang lay under growing threat from the advancing Yunnan Army, the French widened their area of occupation in the autumn of 1884 by establishing posts at Phu Doan and Vie Tri on the Clear River.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 237‚Äì41 In February 1885 Bri√®re de l'Isle defeated China's Guangxi Army in the L·∫°ng S∆°n campaign. The French occupation of Dong Song on 6 February threatened the line of retreat of the Guangxi Army's right wing, and forced the Chinese to withdraw from their positions in the Song Thuong valley to the west of L·∫°ng S∆°n. The occupation of L·∫°ng S∆°n on 13 February gave the French control of the Mandarin Road from L·∫°ng S∆°n all the way back to Hanoi, and Bri√®re de l'Isle was able to use the road to bring prompt relief to the hard-pressed French garrison of Tuy√™n Quang. During the second fortnight of February Colonel Laurent Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade marched down the Mandarin Road to Hanoi and was then ferried up the Red and Clear Rivers to Phu Doan aboard a flotilla of gunboats. On 2 March 1885 Giovanninelli defeated Liu Yongfu's Black Flags in the Battle of H√≤a M·ªôc, relieving the Siege of Tuy√™n Quang.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 241‚Äì6 In March 1885 the French established posts at Cau Son and Thanh Moy, previously occupied by the Guangxi Army, and began to widen the Mandarin Road so that it could be used by wagon trains to supply de N√©grier's 2nd Brigade at L·∫°ng S∆°n. Further to the east, French troops extended the zone of French control along the Gulf of Tonkin, establishing a post at Tien Yen.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 248‚Äì50 In the west, Giovanninelli's victory at H√≤a M·ªôc on 2 March allowed the French to consider an offensive from their main base at H∆∞ng H√≥a against the Yunnan and Black Flag Armies. Bri√®re de l'Isle drew up plans for an advance up the Red River by Giovanninelli's brigade against the Yunnan Army's positions around Thanh Quan, but simultaneous reverses on both the eastern and western fronts on 24 March (the Battle of Bang Bo (Zhennan Pass) and the Battle of Phu Lam Tao) and the subsequent Retreat from L·∫°ng S∆°n on 28 March threw out his plans for an early penetration of the upper course of the Red River.Lecomte, 330 ==The 'pacification' of Tonkin (April 1885‚ÄìApril 1886)== Zouaves embarking at Algiers for Tonkin, January 1885 The Sino-French War ended with the Chinese military pushed out of Tonkin, and the resulting peace treaty between France and China, signed at Tientsin on 9 June 1885, forced China to abandon its historic claim to suzerainty over Vietnam and confirmed the French protectorate over both Annam and Tonkin. In theory, the way was now clear for the French to consolidate their claim to Tonkin. In practice, this was not so easy as it might have seemed. As a British statesman remarked at the time: 'France has won her claim to Tonkin; now all she has to do is conquer it.' Strong reinforcements were sent to Tonkin in the wake of the Retreat from L·∫°ng S∆°n (March 1885), bringing the total number of French soldiers in Tonkin to 35,000 in the summer of 1885. In May and June 1885 thousands of fresh French troops poured into Tonkin, swamping the veterans of the two brigades that had fought the Sino-French War, and the expeditionary corps was reorganised into two two-brigade divisions. Bri√®re de l'Isle was replaced in command of the expeditionary corps on 1 June 1885 by General Philippe-Marie-Henri Roussel de Courcy (1827‚Äì1887), but remained in Tonkin for several months as commander of the 1st Division of the expanded expeditionary corps. General Fran√ßois de N√©grier, who had recovered from the wound he sustained at the Battle of Ky Lua (28 March 1885), was given command of the 2nd Division.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 266‚Äì7 De Courcy's command was marked by growing resistance to French rule in Tonkin and by outright insurrection in Annam. It was also memorable for a cholera epidemic which swept through the expeditionary corps in the summer and autumn of 1885, exacerbated by de Courcy's neglect of quarantine precautions, in which more French soldiers died than in the entire nine months of the Sino- French War. Elements of the Tonkin expeditionary corps were attacked at Hu·∫ø on 2 July 1885 in the so-called 'Hu·∫ø Ambush', which initiated the Vietnamese insurrection. Forbidden by the French government to launch a full-scale invasion of Annam, de Courcy landed troops along the vulnerable coastline of central Vietnam to seize a number of strategic points and to protect Vietnamese Catholic communities in the wake of massacres of Christians by the Vietnamese insurgents at Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i and B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh.Huard, 1,017‚Äì19, 1,020‚Äì23 and 1,096‚Äì1,107; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 268‚Äì75; Histoire militaire, 124‚Äì5 Meanwhile, Tonkin was in a state of near-anarchy. The Chinese armies that had fought the Sino-French War dutifully withdrew from Tonkin in May and June 1885, but their ranks were by then full of Vietnamese volunteers or conscripts, and these men, unpaid for months, were simply disbanded on Tonkinese soil and left to fend for themselves. They kept their weapons and supported themselves by brigandage, in many cases sheltering behind the patriotic rhetoric of the C·∫ßn V∆∞∆°ng insurgency against the French. For most of the summer of 1885, when European troops normally kept to their barracks anyway, French control of Tonkin was limited to a small radius around the perimeter of their military posts.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 267‚Äì8 No attempt was made by de Courcy to move forward to reoccupy L·∫°ng S∆°n, evacuated by the Chinese in May, nor to secure the forts built by the Yunnan Army along the Red River to protect its supply line during the Siege of Tuy√™n Quang. Bands of brigands took over these forts as soon as the Chinese evacuated them. The bandits struck far and wide beyond the limits of French control. Wherever they could, Tonkinese villagers left their homes and took shelter beneath the walls of the French forts.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 275‚Äì6 Only one important French sweep was made during the summer of 1885 in Tonkin, and its effects were transitory. In July 1885 a mixed column of Algerian and Tonkinese riflemen under the command of Colonel Mourlan drove a band of insurgents from the Tam Dao massif and established a French post at Lien Son. The insurgents fled without accepting battle and regrouped in Th√°i Nguy√™n province.Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 121‚Äì2 The blundering response of de Courcy and his staff officers to the twin challenges in Annam and Tonkin has been memorably characterised in a recent French study of the period: > Comme dans un drame shakespearien, des grotesques s‚Äôagitent sur le devant de > la sc√®ne pendant que la trag√©die se poursuit dans le sang, sur toute > l'√©tendue du Tonkin ravag√© et de l'Annam qui bascule dans la guerre au cours > de l'√©t√©.Fourniau, 23 > (As in a Shakesperian drama, clowns gambolled at the front of the stage > while the tragedy was played out in blood, not only across ravaged Tonkin > but in Annam too, which during the summer slid into war.) Uniforms of the Tonkin expeditionary corps, 1885 (fusilier-marin, marine infantryman, Turco and marine artilleryman) De Courcy bestirred himself with the arrival of the autumn campaigning season. The main French effort was made in the west, along the Red River. The Tonkin expeditionary corps undertook a large-scale campaign in October 1885 to capture the Yunnan Army's old base at Thanh May, which had been occupied by Vietnamese insurgents some months earlier. De Courcy concentrated 7,000 troops for the attack on Thanh May, almost as many men as Bri√®re de l'Isle had commanded during the L·∫°ng S∆°n campaign in February 1885. An elaborate encircling movement was mishandled, and though the French duly occupied Thanh May, avenging their defeat in the Battle of Phu Lam Tao seven months earlier, most of the brigands escaped the closing pincers and regrouped further up the Red River around Thanh Quan.Huard, 1,072‚Äì8; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 276; Histoire militaire, 125‚Äì6 In the first week of February 1886 two columns commanded by General Jamais and Lieutenant-Colonel de Maussion, under the overall direction of General Jamont, advanced up both banks of the Red River as far as Thanh Quan. The bands that had been driven from Thanh May did not stay to fight, but melted into the forests before the French advance. On 17 February the French occupied Van Ban Chau. After a pause of several weeks while the French government notified the Chinese that French troops would shortly be closing up to the Chinese frontier, de Maussion was authorised to advance to the Tonkin-Yunnan border. The French occupied L√†o Cai on 29 March, and went on to establish a chain of military posts along the Red River between L√†o Cai and Thanh Quan. De Maussion was appointed commandant sup√©rieur of the Haute Fleuve Rouge region.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 275‚Äì7; Histoire militaire, 125 The French also raised their flags along the Tonkin-Guangxi border. The terms of the June 1885 peace treaty between France and China required both parties to demarcate the border between China and Tonkin. As it would have been embarrassing for the French to admit that this could not be done because the L·∫°ng S∆°n region had been overrun by brigands since the departure of the Guangxi Army in May 1885, de Courcy was forced to send an expedition to regain control of the border region. In November 1885 chef de bataillon Servi√®re led a column north from Chu to reoccupy L·∫°ng S∆°n and ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng. He went on install French posts at That Ke and Cao B·∫±ng. This acte de pr√©sence established the conditions necessary for an orderly demarcation of the Sino-Vietnamese border in 1887, in which a few minor revisions were made in China's favour.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 277 Although the tricolour now flew above French customs posts along the Chinese border, there remained widespread unrest inside Tonkin itself. Significantly, General Fran√ßois de N√©grier was forced to make a major sweep of the Bai Sai region near Hanoi in December 1885, an operation in which hundreds of French troops died of cholera and other diseases.Huard, 1,094‚Äì6; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 277 In April 1886 General Warnet, who had replaced de Courcy as commander of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps a few months earlier, declared that he considered Tonkin to be pacified, and proposed to the French government that the expeditionary corps should be reduced in size to a division of occupation. Conventionally, April 1886 marks the end of the Tonkin campaign. The belief that Tonkin was pacified, however, was ludicrously premature. The Pacification of Tonkin, sometimes involving fighting on a large scale, would require a further ten years.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 284‚Äì8 == Commemoration == The Tonkin commemorative medal The Tonkin campaign was commemorated in France with the issue of a Tonkin Expedition commemorative medal. French soldiers who had taken part in the campaign had hoped that the medal would be inscribed with the names of all their Tonkin victories, but there were some puzzling absences, notably the L·∫°ng S∆°n campaign, from the feats of arms commemorated. This decision angered many veterans, who felt that it did not adequately recognise their deeds.Armengaud, 76 The veterans were further offended by the arrangements made for the Bastille Day parade of 14 July 1886, an imposing annual march through the streets of Paris by the men of France's armed and disciplined services. A special effort was made on this occasion to honour the men who had fought the war with China. Contingents from the battalions and batteries that had served in Tonkin and Formosa marched in the parade, wearing battlefield uniforms instead of full dress. Other arrangements, however, were not so welcome. Although Lieutenant-Colonel Marc-Edmond Domin√©, the hero of the Siege of Tuy√™n Quang, rode in the procession, General Louis Bri√®re de l'Isle and General Fran√ßois de N√©grier did not. Both men were heroes to the soldiers of the expeditionary corps, and the veterans greatly resented their absence from the parade. Instead, the man who rode at the head of the march past was the controversial and ambitious new army minister General Georges Boulanger, who only three years later would be suspected of plotting a coup against the Third Republic. Boulanger had not served in Tonkin, but he was determined to take any credit going for its conquest.Dukay, 118‚Äì24 == Key French players in the Tonkin campaign == Image:Jules Harmand.jpgFran√ßois- Jules Harmand (1845‚Äì1921) File:Alexandre-Eug√®ne Bou√´t.jpgGeneral Alexandre- Eug√®ne Bou√´t (1833‚Äì87) Image:Admiral Courbet drawing.jpgAdmiral Anatole- Am√©d√©e-Prosper Courbet (1827‚Äì85) File:Charles-Th√©odore Millot.jpgGeneral Charles-Th√©odore Millot (1829‚Äì89) Image:Louis Briere de lIsle.jpgGeneral Louis Bri√®re de l'Isle (1827‚Äì96) Image:Fran√ßois Oscar de N√©grier.jpgGeneral Fran√ßois de N√©grier (1839‚Äì1913) File:Ange-Laurent Giovanninelli.jpgColonel Ange-Laurent Giovanninelli (1839‚Äì1903) Image:General Roussel de Courcy.jpgGeneral Philippe-Marie-Henri Roussel de Courcy (1827‚Äì1887) ==NotesReferences== * Armengaud, J.

In a study of the theory and practice of Shingon Buddhism, an extant non-Himalayan school of Vajrayana, Kiyota (1978: p. 70) identifies three kinds of adhi·π£·π≠hƒÅna: #mudra, the finger sign #dhƒÅra·πáƒ´, secret verses #yoga, through meditation practices. The term adhi·π£·π≠hƒÅna is also used to describe the transformative power of the Buddha. According to D. T. Suzuki: ==Stream of blessings== In the Indo-Himalayan lineages of Vajrayana, where traditions of Tantra were introduced in the first wave of translations of Sanskrit texts into Old Tibetan from the 8th century onwards, the term chosen by the community of lotsawa \\"translators\\", which importantly is one of the most concerted translation efforts in documented history, chose to render adhi·π£·π≠hƒÅna as . This metaphorical usage of \\"stream, wave, thread, continuum\\" is reinforced in philosophy with the mindstream doctrine and its relationship to tantric sƒÅdhanƒÅ, where it is used in visualizations and invocations, particularly in relation to the Three Vajras of Padmasambhava and depicted in Indo-Tibetan Buddhist and Bon iconography such as representations of the Adi-Buddha and Tapihritsa. Martin Mills, in a modern political and power-relations dissection of jinlap in relation to hierarchical structures of the Gelug, a Sarma (second-wave) school, holds that: ==Sadhana== *The Prayer of Inspiration known as \\"The Falling Rain of Blessings\\" (gsol 'debs byin rlabs char 'bebs) (from the Yang Zab Nyingpo)Source: (accessed: Sunday January 3, 2010) ==Honzon Kaji== In Shingon Buddhism, mantras, mudras and visualization practices aim at achieving honzon kaji or union with the deity. According to Shingon priest Eijun Eidson: ==Sarira== ≈öarƒ´ra or \\"relics\\" are held to emanate or incite adhi·π£·π≠hƒÅna \\"blessings, grace\\" within the mindstream and experience of those connected to them.Martin, Dan (1994).

McGowan and nephew Anthony Mack. It was the 55th Our Gang short subject released. ==Plot== The neighborhood bully, Tuffy, played by Johnny Downs, is determined to lick every boy in the neighborhood. He beats up one boy, makes Jay and Jackie stand on their heads, and makes Bonedust and Scooter bark like a dog. Along comes Joe and Farina wearing bandages, and pretending to be too disabled to fight, but Tuffy beats them up anyway. Joe and Farina encourage the boys to band together and they then chase the bully off. The gang retires to their hideout and draw lots to decide who should finish the bully off. On second thought, Tuffy was swimming and was not allowed in the premises. Joe and Farina draw the unlucky lots and go looking for the bully, but Peggy tells them that Tuffy has moved to Chicago. Joe and Farina return with the lie that they beat Tuffy up and threw him in the lake. At the end of it, Tuffy's mother spanked him. ==CastThe Gang=== * Joe Cobb as Joe * Jackie Condon as Jackie * Allen Hoskins as Farina * Scooter Lowry as Skooter * Jay R.

Raw foods on such diets have not been heated at temperatures above . ‚ÄúRaw Animal Foodists‚Äù believe that foods cooked above this temperature have lost much of their nutritional value and are harmful to the body. Smoked meats are frowned upon by many Raw- Omnivores. Some make a distinction between hot-smoked and cold-smoked. Those who eat a raw omnivorous diet usually choose to obtain their meats from free- range and grass-fed sources, to avoid harmful bacteria. A study by Cornell University has determined that grass-fed animals have far fewer E. coli (about 1/300th) than their grain fed counterparts. Also in the same study, the amount of E. coli they do have is much less likely to survive our first line defense against infection, gastric acid. Grass-fed meat also has more nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids, than grain-finished meathttp://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/01681605/2001/00000066/00000001/art00492Tony Scott Klopfenstein, T., et al.. 2000 Nebraska Beef Report,:39-41 PFD at eatwild.com Other studies show that E. coli O157:H7, Campylobacter, Salmonella, and other dangerous pathogens have been repeatedly isolated from both grass-fed and grain-fed livestock and there are conflicting results regarding whether the levels of pathogens are higher, lower, or the same when animals are fed grass- or grain-based diets.http://www.marlerblog.com/2008/08/articles/lawyer-oped/grassfed-vs- grainfed-beef-and-the-holy-grail-a-literature-review/ Examples of raw animal food diets include the Primal Diet and the Raw, Palaeolithic diet and the Tiger Diet. The Primal Diet,Meat: A Love Story is a diet consisting of fatty meats, organ meats, dairy, honey, minimal fruit and vegetable juices and coconut cream, all raw. The founder of the Primal Diet is Aajonus Vonderplanitz, a resident of Malibu, California. It has been estimated by Aajonus Vonderplanitz that there are 20,000 followers of his raw-meat-heavy Primal Diet in North America, alone. The Nenet tribe of Siberia eat a traditional diet consisting of mostly raw meats/organ-meats and raw berries. Meat, among other foods, are eaten by the Inuit people partially raw, including internal organs.http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FPNS%2FPNS12_01%2FS0029665153000188a.pdf&code;=5de869c321f69f431e3a1a9fe14560df Pemmican is the traditional North American travel food, prepared from dried meat, fat, and berries.\\"Gardening: Serviceberry is staple of springtime\\" The Spokesman Review.
