He was a member of the South Australian House of Assembly from 1918 to 1938, representing the electorate of Wallaroo. Pedler was born at Salisbury, and educated at the public school at Paskerville. He was raised on the family farm, \\"Gum Farm\\", three miles from Kadina, on which he helped until he was 18. Pedler was a contractor and carter thereafter until 1900, when he inherited the farm and returned to run the property, becoming a successful wheat grower. He became involved in local politics, serving on the Kadina District Council for about thirty years, eventually becoming its chairman, and serving as president of the Kadina branch of the Labor Party. He also served as chairman of the local Agricultural Bureau, President of the Kadina Technical School Council and Vice-President of the Kadina Branch of the Australian Workers Union. Pedler was elected to the House of Assembly for the Labor Party at the 1918 state election, along with future Premier Robert Richards, who Pedler would remain associated with throughout his career. Pedler and Richards defeated two ex-Labor defectors, former Premier John Verran and John Frederick Herbert, who had been expelled from the Labor Party in the 1917 Labor split and had contested the election for the splinter National Party. He was re-elected in 1921, 1924, 1927 and 1930. In 1931, Pedler was expelled from the Labor Party along with Premier Lionel Hill and his Cabinet, when the party split over the Hill Cabinet's support for the Premiers' Plan. The expelled MPs reconstituted as the splinter Parliamentary Labor Party and contested the 1933 election under that banner, but were resoundingly defeated, Pedler and Richards being among their only MPs to be re-elected. Pedler was readmitted to the Labor Party in 1934 along with the remaining PLP MPs. In 1938, the state abolished multi-member districts for the House of Assembly, and established single-member electorates instead. Pedler lost a Labor preselection vote for the new single-member seat of Wallaroo to Richards, and opted to retire from parliament. Pedler died suddenly in 1942. He was still a member of the Kadina Council at the time of his death. ==References== Category:1870 births Category:1942 deaths Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of South Australia Category:Members of the South Australian House of Assembly ","title":"John Pedler"},{"id":"46832852","text":"Telva is a Spanish language monthly women's magazine published in Madrid, Spain.

Between 1952 and 1977 she was in charge at the (East) German News Service (Allgemeiner Deutscher Nachrichtendienst). ==Life== Deba Wieland was born at the height of the First World War, a year before the Treaty of Brest- Litovsk removed Russia from the war with Germany. Her father is described in sources as a German Trade representative based, at the time of her birth, in Moscow which is where she was born. Her mother worked as a book-keeper. From 1919 Wieland grew up in Riga which is where she attended Secondary School (Oberschule) and where in 1933, she passed her school final exams. She had already, in 1932, become a member of Latvia's illegal Young Communists organisation. She studied commercial art in Strasbourg and Brussels. Strasbourg had been back in Germany since 1919 but remained for many purposes a German language city, and it was here that in 1933/34 she worked on the German language newspaper \\"Woman as Fighter\\" (\\"Frau als Kämpferin\\"). Meanwhile in Germany there had been a major regime change in January 1933 and the government had lost little time in moving towards one-party dictatorship. A feature of Nazi philosophy and of the new chancellor's own rhetoric, was a peculiar capacity for hatred, with Jews and Communists high on the target list. Deba Wieland was a Jewish Communist, joining the Communist Party in France in 1937. From 1936 Deba Wielland was a participant in the Spanish Civil War, but the focus of her life remained in Paris, by now the de facto headquarters of the German Communist Party in exile. Between 1937 and 1939 Deba Wieland worked in Paris as a freelance illustrator, also undertaking translation work for the CGT (French Trades Union Confederation) and for L'Humanité, the Paris-based newspaper of the Communist Party. In 1939 she moved to Moscow. Around this time, or possibly some years earlier, she married Heinz Wieland (1907-1980), a fellow communist who had spent much of 1933 held in \\"protective custody\\" in Nazi Germany, and who subsequently, like her, had taken part in the Spanish Civil War. Deba Wieland worked as a translator and teacher at the sanitorium at Peredelkino which the Soviets had set up for Spanish Civil War veterans, and where Heinz Wieland was convalescing from serious wounds incurred in the fighting. Following the conclusion of a non- aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, Latvia where she had spent much of her childhood fell under Soviet control, and in June 1941 Wieland returned to Riga. Later that month relations between the two dictatorships abruptly broke down when Germany launched a vast military assault against the Soviet Union: towards the end of 1941 Wieland was evacuated with her invalid husband to Osh in what at that time was the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic. They remained in the Soviet Union till 1946. Returning to Berlin in June 1946, six months after her husband, she worked as a translator and editor with the Soviet News Service, based in the Weissensee district of Berlin. War had ended with defeat for Germany in May 1945, and a large swathe of what had previously been Germany, including the eastern part of Berlin, had become the Soviet occupation zone, under Soviet Soviet Administration, which left a desperate shortage of fluent Russian speakers across various sectors. In 1949 Deba Wieland became a member of the Berlin- based National Journalists' Union. Back in 1945 it had seemed, for many, reasonable to assume that the end of Nazi Germany marked the end of one-party dictatorship. Membership of the Communist Party was no longer illegal and in 1945, while still in the Soviet Union, Deba Wieland rejoined the French Communist Party. By the time she got back to the west, the next summer, the German Communist Party had been replaced by the Socialist Unity Party (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands), through a contentious merger that within the Soviet occupation zone incorporated the more moderately left-wing Social Democratic Party (SPD) to form a unified party of the broad left, thereby reducing the risk that a resurgent Nazi Party might one day rise again and again exploit political splintering of the political left to re-establish a right-wing dictatorship. As matters turned out, the party merger involving the SPD and the Communists formed the basis for a rapid return to one-party dictatorship, and by the time the occupation zone was re-invented as the German Democratic Republic, formally in October 1949, party members with influence who had previously come from the SPD side in the merger had disappeared from positions of influence, and the young country's ruling SED (party) looked remarkably like the old Communist Party with a new name. Deba Wieland had been a member since 1946. In December 1949 she took a job with her young country's Information Office under the direction of Gerhart Eisler, himself newly returned from several eventful years in the United States. She was promoted in March 1950 to take charge of the Office's department for the Soviet Union and People's Democracies. Between September 1950 and 1952 she was also a deputy head and a trainer at the important Society for German–Soviet Friendship. In parallel with her government positions, she sustained a career as a journalist and editor. In 1952 she took over from Georg Hansen as Director - later \\"General Director\\" - of the (East) German News Service (Allgemeiner Deutscher Nachrichtendienst), a position she would retain till 1977. During this period she also held various other positions near heart of the country's centralised power structure, most notably as a member of the Agitprop Commission of the Party Central Committee's powerful Politburo. Deba Wieland retired in 1980 and died in Berlin in 1992. ==Awards and honours== *1970: Patriotic Order of Merit *1976: Patriotic Order of Merit Gold claspNeue Zeit, 1 May 1976, p. 2 *1984: Star of People's Friendship in GoldNeues Deutschland, 3.

Wajxaklajun is considered to be the most important archaeological site in the San Mateo Ixtatán area. The site has been dated to the Classic period (c. 250–900 AD).Wölfel and Frühsorge 2008, p.88. The Chuj Maya consider the city to have been built by their ancestors. The site has similarities with other nearby highland Maya ruins; it is unusual for the presence of a number of stelae, a feature more associated with lowland sites during the Classic period, probably indicating some level of exchange with lowland cities. ==Etymology== Stela at Wajxaklajun Wajxaklajun means \\"eighteen\\" in the Chuj language;Wölfel and Frühsorge 2008, p. 88. Straffi 2013, p. 257n22. this has been interpreted as deriving from the site originally consisting of eighteen mounds. This is a modern interpretation however, and it is possible that the name originally derived from a Maya calendrical name.Wölfel and Frühsorge 2008, p.89. A longer form of the name has been recorded as Chonjab' Tepan Wajxaklajun; this translates as \\"town and temple eighteen\\",Straffi 2013, p. 257n22. from chonhap' \\"town\\",Hopkins 2012, p. 63. and tepan \\"church\\".Hopkins 2012, p. 312. Alternative names for the site include Yolk'u (meaning \\"in the sun\\") and El Calvario, sometimes contracted to Carvao, or Curvao.MINEDUC 2001, p. 12. At the time of the Spanish conquest of Guatemala, Wajxaklajun was given the Nahuatl name Ystapalan (meaning \\"place of salt\\"); this was later modified to Ystatlan (\\"abundance of salt\\" in Nahuatl).Limón Aguirre 2008, p. 10. ==Location== Wajxaklajun is situated upon a ridge in the Cuchumatanes range, at an altitude of , immediately to the east of the town of San Mateo Ixtatán, within the Huehuetenango Department of Guatemala.Wölfel and Frühsorge 2008, p.86. Wajxaklajun is east of the Classic-period site of Quen Santo, and is from Chinkultic. ==Interactions with neighbouring groups== The site is likely to have had trade links with highland Chiapas, in Mexico, and indirectly with the Maya lowlands. The Chuj are believed to have traded salt from the local springs with the Tojolabal Maya in return for cacao. Local tradition holds that the Chuj captured the salt springs from the Tojolabal in battle.Wölfel and Frühsorge 2008, pp. 90, 93. ==Site description== The main axis of the site has an orientation of S 52° E, aligned along the spur occupied by the ruins.La Farge and Byres 1931, p. 219. The site is distributed over three different levels, consisting of the ground level of the ridge, an area of elevated terrain to the northeast, and a depression to the southwest. The elevation and the depression were both natural features that were incorporated into the pre- Columbian town. Several range structures are situated upon the northeastern portion of the ridge, and upon the elevation, with a view across the valley to nearby salt springs. The slope occupying the southwestern portion of the site was modified with the construction of five stepped platforms, in a similar manner to that of Mesoamerican pyramids. The lower portion of the site supports a large structure that was probably a pyramid. Unusually, Wajxaklajun possesses a number of stelae. Stelae were rarely erected in the highlands after the Preclassic period, and their presence at the site may indicate contacts with the Maya lowlands, where a strong tradition of raising stelae existed during the Classic period. Wajxaklajun is close to Quen Santo, a Classic-period site with hieroglyphic inscriptions. The first modern investigator to mention the ruins was Franz Termer, a German who visited the site in 1926, and mentioned it in print the following year. La Farge and Byres published a detailed description of the site in 1931. Investigators in the first half of the 20th century identified close similarities between Wajxaklajun and nearby sites in Chiapas, such as Tenam Puente and Chinkultic, as well as similarities with Zaculeu, the Mam capital, near modern Huehuetenango city. La Farge and Byres described the site in terms of three levels. ===Level 1=== This level consists of the highest portion of the site, occupying the northern portion of the ridge. A portion of the southeastern side of Level 1 is exposed bedrock; the rest of the southeast side, together with the southwest side, have been terraced into steps. Access to Level 1 from Level 2 is presumed to have been by a stairway on the southeast side, but any evidence of these has been eroded by a modern path.La Farge and Byres 1931, pp. 219-220. Mound E is to the southeast of Building 10. It occupied an intermediary terrace between Levels 1 and 2, on the southeast side of Level 1.La Farge and Byres 1931, pp. 218, 219-220. Mound G is situated at the northern extreme of the archaeological site.La Farge and Byres 1931, p. 218. It was heavily overgrown when examined in the early 20th century, and supported two wooden crosses. Building 10 stands approximately southeast of Mound G, separated from it by a flat expanse. The building stands atop an artificially levelled terrace.La Farge and Byres 1931, pp. 218, 219. The terrain drops away sharply on the northeast, southeast and southwest sides. In the early 20th century, the walls stood almost high and were over thick; it is possible that it represented the remains of an early colonial building, perhaps a church or town hall.La Farge and Byres 1931, p. 222. ===Level 2=== Plaza II, with Mound A at left, and the smaller Mound D with its wooden cross at centre back This level lies immediately southeast of Level 1. A high foundation terrace supports Mounds A and E, and has an addition high step where it borders Plaza III. This terrace extends along the southeastern base of Level 1 and across the northeastern side of Level 2, where steps lead down to Plaza III. On a narrow stretch of the terrace between Plazas I and II are five plain stelae. Plaza I is a small depression in the terrace supporting Mounds A and E, and is at the same level as the main Level 2. Plaza II is to the southeast of Mound A. Plaza III is to the northeast of Mound A, to which it was probably the main approach. Mound A dominates this level. It stands approximately high and measures in length, aligned along the ridge. The northeastern side is badly ruined, and borders on Plaza III.La Farge and Byres 1931, p. 220. Mound B is the remains of a small structure overlooking Level 3. It is at the extreme southeast of Level 2. It is immediately southeast of Mound B. Mound C is another small structure overlooking Level 3. It is also at the extreme southeast of Level 2. It is to the southwest of Mound B, and south of Mound A. Mound D is a small, badly ruined mound in the middle of Plaza II. It supports a modern wooden cross. ===Level 3=== Level 3 is the lowest level, and represents the natural ground level on this part of the ridge. Mound H is a badly ruined mound, southwest of the main structures on Levels 1 and 2, an axis with Mound E and former Mound I.La Farge and Byres 1931, pp. 218, 220. Mound I was a small, badly ruined structure southwest of the principal structures on Levels 1 and 2. It lay between Mounds E and H. ==Threats== The archaeological site is threatened by the construction of new buildings The archeological site is endangered by the urban growth of San Mateo Ixtatán, with the building of new homes taking place on top of the ruins. The demand for land for building is such that the municipal authorities lack the incentive to protect the pre-Columbian remains.SEGEPLAN 2010, p. 74. ==Local traditions== The local Chuj Maya inhabitants of San Mateo Ixtatán consider the ruins to have been built by their ancestors, who were either killed by the Spanish invaders or fled to the hills. These ancestors are understood to have built the monumental architecture in order to be remembered by future generations, which relates well to the current understanding by archaeologists that such architecture was related to particular lineages, and was associated with ancestor worship. The modern Chuj regard the ruins as a sacred place, and it is still the focus of traditional festivities.Wölfel and Frühsorge 2008, pp.86, 89. Tojolabal inhabitants of Chiapas carry out pilgrimages to Wajxaklajun in order to perform ceremonies.Straffi 2013, pp. 257–258. ==See also== *K'atepan ==NotesReferences== : (2012) A Dictionary of the Chuj (Mayan) Language As Spoken in San Mateo Ixtatán, Huehuetenango, Guatemala ca. 1964–65 Tallahassee, Florida, US: Jaguar Tours via Mesoweb. : and (1931) The Year Bearer's People.

The Dame Kelly Holmes Trust runs a number of programmes for disadvantaged young people throughout the UK including Get On Track, AQA Unlocking Potential, Sport For Change and Sporting Champions. Young people have been helped by the trust to gain permanent employment despite various difficulties including criminal records, special needs and lack of school qualifications.

Secular Franciscan Order via Internet Archive. She tried to help the Jews survive during the Holocaust.Avenue of the Righteous (May 4, 2000). In memory of Sister Maria Antonina Kratochwil and all of the Polish priests and sisters who helped Jews in need. Internet Archive. A member of the School Sisters of Notre Dame residing in the Kresy region of the Polish Second Republic before the war began; she was arrested along with her nuns by Nazi Germans a year after Operation Barbarossa of 1941, and singled out for anti- Nazi activities. She was severely beaten while in prison, contracted typhus, and died upon her hasty release. ==Life== Maria Antonina was born in Witkowice near Ostrava where her parents arrived in 1879 from Węgierska Górka in the Austrian Partition in search of sustenance; her father worked at a foundry. In 1885 the family returned to her mother's hometown in Węgierska Górka close to Żywiec, and settled in Bielsko nearby. In 1901 Maria Antonina entered the Congregation of School Sisters of Notre Dame, a worldwide Roman Catholic order devoted to providing primary, secondary, and post-secondary education. She passed her maturation exams in 1906, and became a professed sister. Ten years before the rebirth of sovereign Poland Kratochwil was sent to Karviná near Cieszyn to teach at a Polish elementary school, twice: between 1906–09, and 1910–17. Already in independent Poland she settled in Lwów in the Kresy region where she taught until 1925. She served as director of Catholic boarding school there in 1925–32; relocated to the town of Tłumacz to train other sisters as teachers, and returned to Lwów, where she was appointed director of a school for candidates in 1931–39. ===World War II=== Following the Soviet invasion of Poland at the beginning of World War II, the NKVD authorities closed down the Polish schools in Lwów and dismissed the sisters. Maria Antonina relocated with her nuns to Mikuliczyn in December 1939 (or February 1940). The Soviets raided the convent in Mikuliczyn, nationalized it, and expelled the nuns; they were prohibited from wearing their religious habits ever again. Lwów was taken over by the Germans in June 1941 at the onset of Operation Barbarossa. A year later, Sister Kratochwil was arrested by the Gestapo on 9 July 1942, along with six other nuns, and thrown into prison in Stanisławów (present-day Ivano-Frankivsk, western Ukraine), a provincial capital with a large Polish Jewish population entrapped in the Stanisławów Ghetto. The nuns were kept in a cell with dozens of other women. Sister Kratochwil intervened against the brutal treatment of Jewish female prisoners by the Gestapo office run by the notorious Holocaust perpetrator SS- Hauptsturmführer Hans Krueger. As punishment for her audacity, Kratochwil was subjected to a torturous beating. Returned to the cell all bloodied, she could no longer lie on her back. The six sisters were released at the end of September 1942, after weeks of interrogations. Maria Antonina died from her injuries on 2 October 1942 in a hospital, five days after her release from prison. She was buried in (the no-longer existing) Sapieżyński Cemetery in Stanisławów. Sister Kratochwil was declared patron of Shalom at the 3rd International Shalom meeting held in El Salvador in August 2000. A short book was published about her life in 2001. == Notes References== * * Category:Catholic saints and blesseds of the Nazi era Category:School Sisters of Notre Dame Category:Polish beatified people Category:1881 births Category:1942 deaths Category:20th-century Christian nuns ","title":"Maria Antonina Kratochwil"},{"id":"46833529","text":"Following are the various programs currently, upcoming and formerly broadcast by the Indian Bengali language general entertainment channel Star Jalsha. ==Current programming== { !\\" !Title !Original release !Genre !Production company -

The scandal broke out on 1 January 2014, when an anonymous call was made to the Adana Attorney General, claiming that a number of lorries were on their way to Syria carrying weapons on both days. Despite the Turkish Gendarmerie conducting a search on 19 January, their search was cut short by the Governor of Adana Hüseyin Avni Coş, who claimed that the lorries belonged to the National Intelligence Organisation (MİT). The prosecutor who ordered the search, as well many of the Gendarmerie soldiers who conducted it, were all removed from their posts and some faced legal investigation. The government, then led by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, first claimed that the cargo of the lorries were a 'national secret', but later claimed that the lorries were carrying food and medical supplies to the Turkmen population in Syria. Many critics of the government alleged that the lorries were in fact supplying arms to rebel groups fighting in the Syrian Civil War. On 29 May 2015, the newspaper Cumhuriyet released footage of the search, confirming that the lorries were in fact carrying weapons. The government subsequently faced calls to resign while an investigation began into Cumhuriyet for releasing the footage. A legal complaint against Erdoğan was made by Republican People's Party (CHP) Member of Parliament Hüseyin Aygün, who accused him of high treason for supplying weapons to enemies of the Turkish state. A ban was placed on the footage of the lorries, which emerged to have transported 1,000 mortar shells, 1,000 rifled artillery shells, 50,000 machine gun rounds and 30,000 rifle bullets to what was alleged to be Al Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Syria, but according to later academic study was the Free Syrian Army and rebel Syrian Turkmen. On May 6, 2016, Can Dündar, the editor of the newspaper, was sentenced to imprisonment for five years and 10 months for ″leaking secret information of the state″. Dündar subsequently fled to Germany to avoid imprisonment. On 2019, 22 of the 54 suspects involved in the seizure were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 2 to 20 years for acting on the instructions of a terrorist organization, Gülen movement. As well as obtaining and exposing the secret documents of the state. ==Events1 January: Hatay=== On 1 January 2014, a soldier from the Turkish gendarmerie reported that several lorries were transporting weapons to Syria. In response, the Adana Prosecutor Aziz Takçı requested the police to conduct a search on the lorries. With the alleged influence of Adana Governor Hüseyin Avni Coş, the police officially recorded the cargo of the lorries as 'humanitarian aid', with soldiers not being permitted to attend to the scene. ===19 January: Adana=== With a similar tip-off occurring on 19 January, the prosecution requested the head of Adana's Gendarmerie, Colonel Özkan Çokay to conduct the search on lorries in Adana again allegedly carrying weapons to Syria. The prosecution also threatened to begin legal investigations into soldiers who disobeyed Çokay's command. With 125 gendarmes, the lorries were stopped and searched, with Governor Coş soon becoming aware of the situation and arriving at the search area. Having obtained an emergency command to stop the search, Coş claimed that the lorries belonged to the National Intelligence Organisation (MİT). Çokay refused and demanded that the MİT send a command to stop the search itself, causing a rise in tensions between the gendarmerie, MİT personnel and other police officers who arrived later on. ==AftermathLegal investigations=== The Turkish state TV and radio regulator RTÜK issued a ban on both written and visual reporting in regards to the situation, on the grounds that legal investigations had begun into the search. In January 2015, the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) took the decision to begin disciplinary investigations into five prosecutors involved in giving the order to search the lorries, suspending them from their positions for three months. These included the Adana Attorney General at the time of the scandal, Süleyman Bağrıyanık, and the acting Attorney General Ahmet Karaca. Prosecutor Aziz Takçı was also among those who were subject to a disciplinary investigation, having been initially removed from his post on 24 January 2014. On 8 May 2014, 13 soldiers who had stopped the lorries in Adana were put on trial, with the prosecution calling for life imprisonment. 34 gendarmerie soldiers who were involved in searching the lorries were arrested in April 2015 on suspicion of 'illegal bugging, espionage, invasion of privacy, the perversion of justice on personal beliefs, forgery of official documents, setting up, leading and being part of a terrorist organisation, attempting to obstruct and to bring down the Turkish government'. The anonymous caller who had tipped off the Adana Attorney General about the lorries was identified as a gendarme in Hatay, who was arrested in Diyarbakır on 26 February 2015. ===Government response=== The legal investigations into soldiers and prosecutors involved in stopping and searching the lorries were heavily criticised by the opposition, who claimed that the government was attempting to cover up the real cargo of the trucks. The legal crackdown on the personnel involved also raised questions about judicial impartiality, with many claiming that the ordeal showed that the government was directly in control of the judiciary. The government initially claimed that the cargo in the lorries was a 'national secret'. Shortly after, the government claimed that the lorries were supplying food and medical aid to the Turkmen population in Syria, who had been subject to a humanitarian crisis as a result of the Syrian Civil War. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan accused the prosecutor who ordered the search of being affiliated with Fetullah Gülen and his Cemaat Movement, while Customs Minister Hayati Yazıcı claimed that only rifles for sporting purposes were included in the cargo. With the lorries in Hatay being prevented from being searched, the police allegedly recorded the cargo to be 'humanitarian aid'. The Turkmens, however, claimed that they had not received any humanitarian aid from Turkey. The opposition CHP claimed that the lorries had been carrying weapons and accused the government of lying. The CHP's allegations turned out to be true on 29 May 2015, when footage of the search was leaked showing the lorries to have been carrying arms within their cargo. ==Possible motives== The opposition and media critics of the government have both accused the government of supplying arms to rebel groups in Syria, with critics identifying Al Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) as possible recipients. However, more moderate opposition groups such as the Free Syrian Army could have also been the recipients of the weapons. Critics who accuse the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government of supplying arms to Al Qaeda or ISIL point to the AKP's Islamist roots as a possible motive, as well as the government's strong opposition to Syrian President Bashar Al Assad. The opposition CHP, which alleged that the search in Adana proved that the lorries were carrying arms into Syria, accused the government of funding these terrorist organisations. It was also alleged that documents revealing that the true recipients of the lorries' cargo was in fact Al Qaeda and ISIL. The AKP government have been accused of financially supporting ISIL before. ==May 2015 revelations== On 29 May 2015, footage recorded during the searches conducted in Adana were released to the newspaper Cumhuriyet. The footage showed that the lorries were in fact carrying arms, amongst humanitarian aid that appeared to have been placed strategically to hide transported weaponry. The revelations occurred just over a week before the June 2015 general election. ===Domestic reactions=== In response to the revelations, the government faced calls to resign, while an investigation began into Cumhuriyet regarding the release of the footage. A legal complaint against Erdoğan was made by Republican People's Party (CHP) Member of Parliament Hüseyin Aygün, who accused him of high treason for supplying weapons to enemies of the Turkish state. Investigations began into journalist Can Dündar for writing an article about the footage. The Socialist Party of Refoundation issued a statement accusing Erdoğan, Davutoğlu and former MİT undersecretary Hakan Fidan of war crimes. ===International reactions=== * – In response to the scandal, United Nations spokesperson Stephane Dujarric stated that the UN was strongly against the sending of arms to combatants in Syria, no matter what side they were on or which group they represented. * – During a conference organised to discuss the international response to ISIL, the Foreign Minister of France Laurent Fabius stated with regard to the scandal that sending weapons to ISIL was out of the question.http://www.cihan.com.tr/haber/Fransa- Disisleri-Bakani-Fabiustan-MIT-TIRlari-aciklamasi_7396-CHMTc5NzM5Ni80 * – Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken stressed the fact that Turkey, as well as many other countries, had agreed to come together in order to combat ISIL. * - German ambassador Erdmann joined the process against the journalist as an observer until the public was banned.

The term is, perhaps, less often used today than it was in the 1960s to 1980s but the concept still lies behind many economic actions by governments which are not performed specifically for financial reasons or by supporting incomes (e.g. via tax rebates). Examples include in-kind transfers such as the provision of food stamps to support nutrition, the delivery of health services to improve quality of life and reduce morbidity, subsidized housing and education. == Definition == A merit good can be defined as a good which would be under-consumed (and under-produced) in the free market economy. This is due to two main reasons: # When consumed, a merit good creates positive externalities (an externality being a third party/spill-over effect which arises from the consumption or production of the good/service). This means that there is a divergence between private benefit and public benefit when a merit good is consumed (i.e. the public benefit is greater than the private benefit). However, as consumers only take into account private benefits when consuming merit goods, it means that they are under-consumed (and so under- produced). # Individuals are myopic, they are short-term utility maximisers and so do not take into account the long term benefits of consuming a merit good and so they are under-consumed. == Justification == In many cases, merit goods provide services which should apply universally to everyone in a particular situation, a view that is close to the concept of primary goods found in work by philosopher John Rawls or discussions about social inclusion. Lester Thurow claims that merit goods (and in-kind transfers) are justified based on \\"individual-societal preferences\\": just as we, as society, believe that each person is entitled to an equal vote in the elections, we also believe that each person is entitled to an equal right to life, and hence an equal right to life-saving medical care. On the supply side, it is sometimes suggested that there will be more support in society for implicit redistribution via the provision of certain kinds of goods and services, rather than explicit redistribution through income.Musgrave and Musgrave, 1973, p. 81 It is sometimes suggested that society in general may be in a better position to determine what individuals need, since individuals might act irrationally (for example, poor people receiving monetary transfers might use them to buy alcoholic drinks rather than to buy nutritious food). Sometimes, merit and demerit goods are simply seen as an extension of the idea of externalities. A merit good may be described as a good that has positive externalities associated with it. Thus, an inoculation against a contagious disease may be seen as a merit good. This is because others who may not now catch the disease from the inoculated person also benefit. However, merit and demerit goods can be defined in a different way which makes it different from externalities. The essence of merit and demerit goods is to do with an information failure to the consumer. This arises because consumers do not perceive quite how good or bad the good is for them: either they do not have the right information or lack relevant information. With this definition, a merit good is defined as good that is better for a person than the person who may consume the good realises.CIE International AS and A level Economics -.131 Other possible rationales for treating some commodities as merit (or demerit) goods include public-goods aspects of a commodity, imposing community standards (prostitution, drugs, etc.), immaturity or incapacity, and addiction. A common element of all of these is recommending for or against some goods on a basis other than consumer choice.Musgrave, 1987, p. 452 However, there is no reason why governments should not consult their populations on such issues as they increasingly do in a number of economic contexts (e.g., development planning by the World Bank or resource allocation in health systems using information on health-benefits). In the case of education, it can be argued that those lacking education are incapable of making an informed choice about so many benefits of education, which would warrant compulsion (Musgrave, 1959, 14). In this case, the implementation of consumer sovereignty is the motivation, rather than rejection of consumer sovereignty. Public Choice Theory suggests that good government policies are an under-supplied merit good in a democracy. == Criticism == Arguments about irrational behavior of welfare receivers are often criticised for being paternalistic, often by those who would like to reduce to a minimum economic activity by government. The principle of consumer sovereignty in welfare also suggests that monetary transfers are preferable to in-kind transfers of the same cost. ==References== * Richard A.

R. Simons is a chemical engineer and senior academic employed by the University College London. In 2012 he was appointed Director of the International Energy Policy Institute (IEPI) and the inaugural BHP Billiton Chair of Energy Policy at UCL Australia. Prior to moving to Australia, Simons established the School of Engineering at Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan-– the world's largest producer of uranium. Simons' work has been published in over 200 journals, books and conference proceedings. == Education == Simons has a Science degree with honours from the University of Surrey (1986) and a PhD from the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. == Career == Simons' chemical engineering career has focussed on particle technology applications for the mineral resources and pharmaceutical sectors. Simons was awarded a Royal Academy of Engineering Global Research Fellowship to further the development of low-carbon technologies and processes for energy and chemical industries. His fellowship was undertaken at the University of California, Berkeley (2009) and the University of Melbourne (2010). Simons has worked with universities in Kazakhstan and Russia since 1994, developing chemical engineering degree curricula there. He spent three years establishing the School of Engineering at Nazarbayev University in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan’s capital city. The university is a strategic partner of the University College London. In August 2012 Simons moved from Nur-Sultan to Adelaide, South Australia to assume his dual roles at the International Energy Policy Institute. === Carbon8 Systems Ltd === Simons is also the Director of Engineering at Carbon8 Systems Ltd, a British company which was created in 2006 to commercialise \\"accelerated carbonation\\" processes for waste treatment. The processes were developed by researchers working at UCL and the University of Greenwich. The process is applicable to the incineration of municipal garbage, an activity becoming increasingly common in Europe and responsible for the production of hazardous fly ash. Carbon8's accelerated carbonation processes make the byproduct of garbage incineration cheaper to dispose of and can also produce aggregates which can then be used as construction materials. Carbon8 claims to have produced the world's first commercially available carbon negative aggregates. In 2012, the University of Greenwich said that the processes also had potential use in the management of nuclear wastes. Commercial prospects for accelerated carbonation attracted the interest of Grundon Waste Management, which has since invested millions of pounds in the establishment of a new company called Carbon8 Aggregates Ltd. The first commercial Carbon8 facility treated wastes from Grundon's energy-from-waste plant at Colnbrook. The Colnbrook incinerator first began incinerating garbage in 1990 and low-level radioactive waste in 2010. A doubling of infant mortality rates in the nearby town of Slough was recorded between 2010 and 2012. The increased mortality ran counter to the national trend (one of steady, gradual improvement) and prompted speculation that the incineration could be linked to the change. == Nuclear industrial advocacy == Since his appointment at UCL Australia, Simons has posed the questions: What would it take to establish a nuclear submarine capability in Australia? Is it time for nuclear energy for Australia? and has advocated for nuclear power in Australia. == References == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:British chemical engineers Category:Alumni of the University of Surrey Category:Alumni of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology Category:University College London Australia faculty ","title":"Stefaan Simons"},{"id":"46833881","text":"The 2015–16 season is Petrolul Ploiești's 86th season in the Romanian football league system, and their fifth consecutive season in the Liga I. Petrolul came sixth in the 2014–15 Liga I. At the beginning of February 2015, due to president Capră still being under detention, the club faced financial problems and entered insolvency, meaning that the participation in UEFA Europa League and UEFA Champions League is denied. ==Month by month reviewJune=== Due to the financial problems, the club had to terminate or not extend the contracts of seventeen players, including Pablo de Lucas, Victoraș Astafei and Jean Sony Alcénat.

Nike remained the kit manufacturer, while Superbet, a gambling company, replaced Alexandrion as the main sponsor of the team. \\"The Yellow Wolves\\" settled their pre-season training stage at Zlatibor, in the neighbouring country Serbia. The stage started on June 21 and ended on July 4. The club tested and signed new footballers during this period, generally ones who played in the French lower divisions, like Abdellah Zoubir, Ismail Hassan or Nicolas Farina.

The club plays Gaelic football and is a member of the North division of Mayo GAA. ==History== The first record of Ardagh fielding a GAA team was in 1908 when they played Knockmore in a challenge game. Although there was a keen interest in football in the area, there was no official team in Ardagh until 1929. As it was the custom then for the better players to play with the great Stephenites club in Ballina. That team recorded some notable wins during the years 1929-’32. That team disbanded in 1932 when a lorry in which the team were returning from a playing a match in Skreen crashed and many of the players were injured and never played again. Another team was affiliated in 1944 but due to immigration, was disbanded in 1946. In the late 1950s and 1960s Ardagh teams won many local 7-a-side tournaments and some of the players played for Ballina and Crossmolina. In 1972 a new club was formed named Ardmoy, representing Ardagh and Moygownagh parishes.

It was commissioned by the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and composed between June and December 1988. The work was premiered in Baltimore by the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra under conductor David Zinman, May 18, 1989.Stucky, Steven. Son et lumière, for orchestra: Program Note by the Composer. Retrieved May 29, 2015. ==Composition== Son et lumière has a duration of roughly 9 minutes. The title translates to \\"sound and light\\", which is taken from the eponymous form of nighttime entertainment performed at tourist attractions. In the program notes to the score, Stucky said he \\"intended [the piece] as an orchestral entertainment whose subject is the play of colors, bright surfaces, and shimmery textures.\\" Stucky further commented on the style of the work, writing: The structure of the piece also roughly follows the sonata form predominantly used in the Classical period of classical music. ==Reception== Reviewing the Los Angeles premiere of Son et lumière with André Previn and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Daniel Cariaga of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"this colorful musical canvas produces fascinating and exotic, and mostly tonal, sounds in imaginative combinations. It is quite attractive, consistently engaging. Written last year for the Baltimore Symphony, the brief tone-poem-- one about colors, not emotions--ought to reach and entertain many listeners. It certainly seemed to do that for those at the Music Center Wednesday night.\\" Allan Kozinn of The New York Times also praised the piece, writing, \\"though only nine minutes long, [it] draws expansively on an orchestra’s resources, particularly its brasses and percussion (though the strings and woodwinds come into their own late in the piece). Minimalist ostinatos propel the piece, but Mr. Stucky has so much going on, in so many layers and usually at contrasting tempos, that his use of repetition seems a secondary concern.\\" Music critic Peter Burwasser called the work \\"bright\\" and \\"propulsive\\" and said, \\"Stucky has a Gallic, almost palpable feel for the sonic character of music, even at the expense of narrative shape.\\" ==References== Category:Compositions by Steven Stucky Category:1988 compositions Category:Symphonic poems Category:20th-century classical music Category:Music commissioned by the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra ","title":"Son et lumière (composition)"},{"id":"46833937","text":"The Great Seal of Ireland was the seal used until 1922 by the Dublin Castle administration to authenticate important state documents in Ireland, in the same manner as the Great Seal of the Realm in England. The Great Seal of Ireland was used from at least the 1220s in the Lordship of Ireland and the ensuing Kingdom of Ireland, and remained in use when the island became part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1801–1922), just as the Great Seal of Scotland remained in use after the Act of Union 1707. After 1922, the single Great Seal of Ireland was superseded by the separate Great Seal of the Irish Free State and Great Seal of Northern Ireland for the respective jurisdictions created by the partition of Ireland. ==Use== The office of \\"Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of Ireland\\" was held by the Lord Chancellor of Ireland. The Chancellor was presented with the physical seal upon taking his oath of office, and it was otherwise kept in the Court of Chancery. When the Chancellor was absent, Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal were appointed.O'Flanagan 1870, Vol.1 p.16 The seal was affixed to documents issued by the Privy Council of Ireland and its head the chief governor (latterly called the Lord Lieutenant). In the fifteenth century, the Chief Governor was generally non-resident and was represented by a Lord Deputy.Wood 1922, p.208 The Governor or Deputy would issue a type of writ called a fiant to the Lord Chancellor, mandating the issue of a patent (\\"letters patent\\") under the Great Seal.Wood 1922, p.217 In the fourteenth century, the Chancellor was entitled to a guard of six men-at-arms and twelve mounted archers, in part to protect the seal in his custody.Gilbert 1865, pp.209–10; O'Flanagan 1870, Vol.1 p.47 The Chief Governor was appointed in London under the Great Seal of England, but a 1498 Act allowed a vacancy to be temporarily filled by the Dublin administration under the Irish seal.Gilbert 1865, pp.464–5 This practice was applied several times in the 1690s. In the fifteenth century, the Governor was appointed under the king's privy sealWood 1922, p.213 and appointed his Deputy under the Irish seal.Wood 1922, p.212 From 1700 to 1767, non-resident Lords Lieutenant were appointed under the British Great Seal, and would in turn use the Irish seal to appoint resident Lord Justices as deputies. Before the Act of Union 1800, any bill passed by the Parliament of Ireland and approved by the Privy Council of Ireland was sent to London under the Great Seal of Ireland and, if approved by the Privy Council of England (later the Privy Council of Great Britain), was returned under the Great Seal of the Realm to be enacted.Gilbert 1865, pp.455–6 This procedure was required both under Poynings' Law (1495) and under the Constitution of 1782 which amended it. Parliament was summoned under the Great Seal of England rather than that of Ireland, even after 1782. Titles in the Peerage of Ireland were originally created under the English seal. After the Williamite War they were usually created under the Irish seal, but creations under the British seal continued, even after the Constitution of 1782, until the Act of Union 1800. Robert Raymond, 1st Baron Raymond wrote that, under the British seal, the Irish nature of the peerage had to be made explicit. Sometimes a single patent created separate titles in the Irish and English/British peerages for the same person. When Lord Thurlow faulted Lord Loughborough for creating Irish peers under the British seal, Lord Eldon said Loughborough had also done so. After the Union, the question of whether Irish peers appointed under the British seal were entitled to vote for Irish representative peers was considered by the British House of Lords in 1805. The 1289 \\"ordinance for the State of Ireland\\" forbade purveyance except by a commission under the Great Seal of Ireland.Gilbert 1865, p.565 From the Tudor Reconquest, appointments to the Irish judiciary were made entirely under the Irish seal. ==History== An Irish chancery was established in 1232 separate from the English chancery, and all documents issued from the Irish chancery were sealed with the \\"great seal of the king used in Ireland\\". Most thirteenth-century land grants continued to be issued in England with the English seal, and then sent to the Irish chancery to be enrolled. In 1256, King Henry III granted the Lordship of Ireland to his heir, the future Edward I, and ordered that Edward's personal seal should have \\"royal authority\\" there.Gilbert 1865, p.103 Henry took Ireland back from Edward in 1258. Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland was similarly authorised to use his own great seal by Richard II in 1385;O'Flanagan 1870, Vol.1 p.49 Richard ordered de Vere's seal to be broken in 1389.Gilbert 1865, pp.259–60 In the 1300s, pardons for felony were granted under both the Irish and the English seals. In 1417, the Chancellor, Laurence Merbury, refused to authenticate with the seal a petition to the King from the Parliament on the state of Ireland.Gilbert 1865, p.310Statute Law Revision Act 2007; 1421 (9 Hen. 5) c. 5: \\"Complaint as to Sir Laurence Merbury, Chancellor, having refused to affix the Great Seal to a message for the King\\" In 1423, the Chancellor Richard Talbot, archbishop of Dublin, refused to acknowledge Edward Dantsey, Bishop of Meath, as Deputy because the Governor, Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, had appointed Dantsey with his privy seal instead of the Great Seal. In 1460, Richard of York, under threat of arrest in England, fled to Ireland and persuaded the parliament to pass a declaration of independence stating in part that Ireland was \\"corporate of itself\\" and that \\"henceforth no person or persons being in the said land of Ireland shall be, by any command given or made under any other seal than the said seal of the said land, compelled to answer to any appeal or any other matter out of the said land\\".Gilbert 1865, pp.367–71 The Lord Deputy Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare refused Edward IV's command to annul this, and it was not until Poynings' Parliament in 1495 that this was done. In 1478, after Kildare was replaced as Lord Deputy by Henry Grey, 4th (7th) Baron Grey of Codnor, the Lord Chancellor Rowland FitzEustace, 1st Baron Portlester, who was Kildare's father-in-law, organised a campaign of non-co-operation with the new Deputy and refused to hand over the Great Seal, making the conduct of official business impossible. Kildare argued that Grey had been appointed under the privy signet instead of the Irish Great Seal. King Edward IV ordered Thomas Archbold, the Master of the Royal Mint in Ireland, to strike a new Great Seal, \\"as near as he could to the pattern and fabric of the other, with the difference of a rose in every part\\". The king decreed that the Seal held by Portlester was annulled, and that all acts passed under it were utterly void;Statute Law Revision Act 2007; 1478 (18 Edw. 4 sess. 3) c. 11: \\"All writs under the Great Seal to be void until Sir Roland Fitz Eustace restore it to the Lord Deputy; meanwhile a new seal to be made\\" but to no avail. So effective was the campaign of obstruction that after a few months Lord Grey was forced to return to England.Gilbert 1865, pp.403–7 In 1484, clerk James Collynge was charged with forging the Great Seal of Ireland for a fake pardon to the treasurer of Limerick Cathedral, and outlawed unless he appeared before the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas.; ; Statute Law Revision Act 2007; 1484 (1 Ric. 3) c. 23 \\"James Collynge to appear to answer charges of forging the Great Seal of Ireland\\" One of the developments which Henry VII and the Tudor Reconquest of Ireland sought to reverse was that the Lord Deputy's private seal, kept by his secretary, was being used in place of the Great Seal of Ireland. In 1638, Lord Chancellor Viscount Loftus refused to kneel before Lord Deputy Thomas Wentworth when delivering the Great Seal to him, contributing to the breakdown in their relationship. In 1662, the fee to the Lord Chancellor for patents under the Great Seal was increased to 10 shillings sterling per patentee. The 1722 patent for Wood's halfpence was issued under the British seal rather than the Irish, which was among the complaints Jonathan Swift made in his Drapier's Letters condemning the currency. During a lawsuit between the Marquess of Donegall and the Irish Society over fishing rights in Lough Neagh, Viscount Pery argued that the Society's 1662 charter was invalid as it was made under the English seal rather than the Irish one; the Irish Parliament passed an act in 1795 validating all land grants made under the English seal.; The Constitution of 1782 removed the role of the British great seal in Irish legislation. Napper Tandy of the Society of United Irishmen challenged his 1792 arrest on the grounds that government officials, from the Lord Lieutenant down, had been appointed under the British rather than the Irish seal. This was intended not to persuade the judges, who vehemently rejected the argument, but to increase public sympathy. The Act of Union 1800 provided that the Great Seal of Ireland could continue to be used in Ireland, and that at elections to the Westminster parliament for constituencies in Ireland, the writs and certified returns would be under the Irish rather than the British seal.Act of Union (Ireland) 1800, Article 8, sections 8 and 10. ==Design== Unused sketch by Nicholas Hilliard for an Irish Great Seal for Elizabeth I, now in the British Museum A new seal was created for each new monarch, whose likeness would be on the obverse. (On the accession of Richard II in 1377, the seal of Edward III was re-used to save money, with only the king's name being updated.Gilbert 1865, p.243O'Flanagan 1870, Vol.1 p.48) The seal included the arms of Ireland: until 1536, three crowns; after that, an Irish harp. Oliver Cromwell's Great Seal for Ireland, cast by Thomas Simon in 1655, was similar to Simon's 1653 Great Seal for the Protectorate, with the view of London on the obverse replaced by one of Dublin, and the quartered arms on the reverse replaced with the Irish arms, still with Cromwell's arms inescutcheoned. From Queen Victoria on, the Great Seal of Ireland had the same design as the Great Seal of the Realm except for the replacement, under the figure on the reverse, of Britannia's trident with the Irish crowned harp. James Roderick O'Flanagan described the contemporary seal in 1870: The seal matrix was cast in silver and the impressions made in sealing wax. Irish Great Seals are attested from the thirteenth century, though surviving impressions of them are rare. Most state papers were destroyed, in multiple fires between 1304 and 1758, and in an explosion in the Battle of Dublin in 1922. According to Hilary Jenkinson, \\"a fairly intensive search some years [before 1954] in England and Ireland for impressions of the Irish Seals produced a total of only forty, for the period from the thirteenth century [to 1800]\\". ===Decommissioning=== The seal matrix was replaced when it was worn out and when a new monarch acceded to the throne. Once the new seal was ready, the old one was broken up or, latterly, \\"damasked\\" (ceremonially defaced) with a hammer. A custom beginning with Nicholas Bacon in England and soon extending to Ireland was that the Keeper of the Seal could melt down the decommissioned seal to make silverware, most often a so-called \\"Seal Cup\\". Lord Chancellor archbishop Adam Loftus made at least two Seal Cups for Rathfarnham Castle from Great Seals of Elizabeth I. The 1902 seal of Edward VII, which passed to Redmond Barry on the king's demise, was sold at auction in 1969 for £750. It had a diameter of and weighed . ==Supersession== The Government of Ireland Act 1920 transferred custody of the seal from the Lord Chancellor to the Lord Lieutenant on 27 June 1921.Government of Ireland Act 1920, §44 The physical seal was in the Crown and Hanaper Office in the Four Courts when that was occupied by the Irish Republican Army on 14 April 1922 in the buildup to the Civil War. Under British law the writs for the Irish Free State election of 16 June 1922 had to be passed under the Great Seal, so an order in council was passed to authorise a substitute seal. The explosion in the Four Courts during the Battle of Dublin was initially assumed to have destroyed the Great Seal, but it was later found in the rubble. The 1920 act intended the Great Seal of Ireland to be used by both Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. Judges were appointed in 1921 and 1922 to Northern Ireland courts by letters patent under the Great Seal of Ireland.; Several writs for the Westminster election of 15 November 1922 were burnt by republicans in Dublin when sent from Northern Ireland to be sealed. The Great Seal of Ireland became obsolete on 6 December 1922, with the coming into force of the Constitution of the Irish Free State. Under the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922 a separate Great Seal of Northern Ireland was created. The letters patent appointing the first Governor of Northern Ireland allowed him to use his private seal until the Great Seal was ready. Although the Free State Constitution did not mention any seal, the letters patent appointing its first Governor-General mandated use of a Great Seal of the Irish Free State, with interim provision for use of the Governor- General's private seal. The Free State Great Seal was delivered in 1925 to a design agreed by the Executive Council. In 1927, Lord Birkenhead said he supposed the obsolete pre-1922 Great Seal was in the possession of the Free State Executive Council. However, when the Free State came into being on 6 December 1922, Gerald Horan, outgoing Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper, informed Hugh Kennedy, the incoming Attorney General of Ireland, that \\"he had handed over the Great Seal of Ireland to the 'Imperial Representative' at the Viceregal Lodge but was retaining the 'former' Great Seal\\". Some time between August 1925 and July 1927, Horan donated to the National Museum of Ireland \\"The Great Seal of Ireland, George V. two silver matrices.\\" ==ReferencesFootnotes=Sources=== * * ; Vol. I, Vol. II * * ===Citations=Further reading== * * * ==External links== * National Museum of Ireland: search historical collections Search for \`Great Seal\`; items with images include seals of George III and Charles II, a pouch for the seal of William IV, a box for the seal, and a document with a seal of Victoria.

A water carrier collected water from a source (a river, a well, water pumps, etc.) and transported or carried containers with water to people's homes. After the construction of pipe networks, the profession of water carrier became unnecessary and disappeared. In late Qing dynasty Chengdu, there were over one thousand people who worked as water carriers. They didn't just perform their official duties, but also helped the elderly and sick who could not take care of themselves with housework. In the 1940s Chengdu water carriers still went barefoot to show that they go deep into the river to collect the purest water. == Gallery == File:Le Kef les porteurs d'eau.JPGTunisia, early 20th Century File:Weeks Edwin Water Carriers Of The Ganges.jpgWater Carriers Of The Ganges river, early 20th Century File:Pails and buckets.jpgRajasthan in 2006 File:Ponti Water carrier.jpgVenice, 19th Century File:Edouard Castres Porteuse d’eau au bord du Nil.jpgWater Carrier on the Banks of the Nile river, early 20th Century File:Eugen von Blaas Die Wasserträgerin 1887.jpgThe Water Carrier, by Eugene de Blaas, early 20th Century File:Pikolan A.jpgStatue of a water carrier with a pikolan (yoke), China File:Puerto del Rosario - Avenida de Juan de Bethencourt-Calle Leon Y Castillo - El Aguador 02 ies.jpgEl Aguador (The Water Carrier) by Emiliano G.

They were descendants of the original Norman invaders and hence they were distinct from the rest of Ireland in their customs, manners and appearance. As time progressed, the Yola people became mixed with the diverse medieval ethnic mix which colonized County Wexford, including French, Norman, Danish, Welsh, English, Irish, Flemish and the original Old Norse settlers who colonized the area prior to the invasion. ==Customs, dress and manners== The Yola people used a number of unique customs that were thought to have originated in the old Duchy of Normandy. These included mumming, patrons, and the tradition of placing funeral crosses on roadway trees, which still continue to this day. They were known to be extremely law-abiding; incidents of robbery, murder and the like were seldom recorded in the baronies. A woman's customary dress was a lilac kircher or bonnet with ribbons, and a large frock worn as the main garment, with ribbons of various colors tying them across the waist. A man wore a waistcoat, short trousers and long socks with a hat. Norman utensils such as a \\"peeler\\" were used for cooking bread. Many unique dishes such as buskés, a type of spiced corn bread, were common in the area. A local custom was to take a daily afternoon nap known as an enteete in the local tongue, similar to the Spanish siesta. It was common at this time of day to cross from one end of the baronies to the other and not to see a single person on the roads. ==Language== The Yola language, also known as the Forth and Bargy dialect, was a unique dialect that formed in the baronies. It was mainly spoken in the structure of Old/Middle English but contained many loanwords from Irish, Norman-French and Old Norse. It was similar to the Dorset dialects of West England, but its many loanwords have made it a source of major research by many academics. The language crossed the lines between Old Frisian and Old English and contained many words found only in Old Frisian. This has led some researchers to believe that it may have originated in the Frisia region (North Holland). There were also Flemish mercenaries who took part in the 1169 invasions who may have contributed to the some of the Flemish content, but Flemish influence on the dialect was very small. According to recently found documents at the national library the language and people originated in heege, Netherlands. The people were displaced after the All Saints' floods of 1170 when large storms and flooding destroyed the farms of the lowlands and they sought refuge across the water from King Henry of England. They stayed for some time in Dover, passed through Kent and the west countries and were eventually granted lands in Pembrokeshire by the King, 100 years after leaving their homeland groups of these settlers eventually found their way to Forth and Bargy and were used as farmers to populate the baronies during the Norman Invasions. There were also a small number of Spanish words found in the dialect such as mucha and capote, these were thought to have come from a small number of Spanish religious refugee families which settled in the baronies in the 15th century. It was spoken as the main language until the late 19th century and the Irish language never took precedence in the baronies. ==Farming== The baronies of Forth and Bargy are quite unique in that they do not experience as harsh a climate as the rest of the country, which allows for many crops to thrive in their flat and fertile plains. The main crops grown by the Yola people were beans, peas and barley; potatoes were not relied upon as heavily as in the rest of Ireland. The farmers practised an advanced crop rotation and fertilizing system far ahead of the rest of the country. For that reason, the baronies did not experience the effects of the Great Famine and actually thrived during that period by simply relying on the bean crop. ==Decline== The Yola people eventually merged into Irish culture. Many lands were confiscated during the plantations and modern English was introduced at this time. The Yola language eventually succumbed to the same factors that killed off the Irish language in the county, which was the stigmatization of the language and the introduction of English in schools. The language was officially declared extinct in the 1850s. Their lineal descendants still populate the majority of the baronies and many customs and words survive in the locality. ==ReferencesExternal links== *A Glossary, with Some Pieces of Verse, of the Old Dialect of the English Colony in the Baronies of Forth and Bargy, County of Wexford, Ireland - via books.google.ie *Historyireland.com - The Ethnic Mix in Medieval Wexford * * *Yola Farmstead & Folk Park - - via homepage.eircom.net (archived) Category:Ethnic groups in Ireland Category:People from Normandy ","title":"Yola people"},{"id":"46834243","text":"IT Valley (), formerly known as Silicon Valley of Turkey (Turkish: Türkiye'nin Silikon Vadisi) was a proposed project of Turkish architect Günay Erdem and Turkish landscape architect Sunay Erdem for the Turkish version of the Silicon Valley at San Francisco, United States.] == Concept and design == Erdem used cosmos and technology concepts together with traditional Turkish values at design development process.

Zuccone San Giovanni led to the construction of a rural palace of lodge, later also known as Villa Sacro Cuore, Villa Zuccone Jacini, or Villa Zuccone Rubasacco. A request to build an oratory at the site was made in 1571, by Battista Fedele to the archbishop of Milan, Carlo Borromeo. The property came into hands of the Cardinal Angelo Maria Durini (1725-1796) who used the property as a hunting lodge. The land then became property of Michele Bussi, a merchant of Milan, who was the great-grandfather of the Countess Carolina Jacini, widow of Cavi. The family commissioned a refurbishment of the property by the architect Marquis Antonio Citterio (1853-1936), pupil of Camillo Boito. He designed two advancing wings and more theatrical facades with statues and gardens. Decorative door and window frames, twirling chimneys, and wrought-iron balconies give the small property an air of elegance. The entrance is through a bifurcated staircase.

Missile Group 11 (, FKGrp 11) was activated at Kaufbeuren Air Base in February 1958, equipped with the MGM-1 Matador cruise missile. On 1 September 1963, FKG 1 was activated at Saarburg Kaserne in Landsberg am Lech. On 1 January 1964 FKGrp 11 was assigned to FKG 1. In May 1964, FKGrp 12 was formed as a subordinate unit in Landsberg. On 1 October 1965 FKGrp 11 was dissolved and FKGrp 13 was officially formed in Kaufbeuren. The wing went through training at Fort Sill on the Pershing missile. FKGrp 12 fired missiles in April 1964 and FKGrp 13 in July 1964. The wing received missiles at their Quick Reaction Sites in West Germany on 12 August 1964. The wing was authorized six launchers; this increased to eight launchers in 1965. A quick reaction alert (QRA) site was established at Schwabstadl, south of Lechfeld Air Base. A new QRA site south of Landsberg became operational in 1970. In 1971, the wing upgraded to 36 Pershing 1a launchers. FKGrp 12 and FKGrp 13 were dissolved and four squadrons were formed. Warheads were under U.S. control, released only in wartime conditions. Warheads for FKGrp 12 were controlled by the 82nd United States Army Missile Detachment (82nd USAFAD) and warheads for FKGrp 13 were controlled by the 74th United States Army Missile Detachment from 1965 to 1971. After FKG 1 reorganized in 1971, the two missile detachments were merged into the 74th U.S. Army Field Artillery Detachment which provided support from 1971 to 1991. A new combat alert site (CAS) at Lehmgrube in Kettershausen was completed in 1975 for FKG 1, but the site was turned over to the 56th Field Artillery Brigade, who named it Fort von Steuben. A new QRA Site at Ochsenhof was activated in March 1976. The QRA site at Schwabstadl was closed and the Landsberg-Süd site became a training site. FKG 1 then moved to Görisried/Bodelsberg.

The German government agreed to destroy its Pershing 1a systems when the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty on 27 May 1988, thus the Pershing 1b was never deployed. Although not covered by the treaty, West Germany agreed unilaterally to the removal of the Pershing 1a missiles from its inventory in 1991, and the missiles were destroyed in the United States.

Given the importance of the port to the national economy, and the previously poor facilities of the port, a great deal of investment occurred in the 2010s. This facilitated the growth of the mining industry in the country, with the exportation of bauxite. Plans to develop the port to support the shipping of bauxite go back to at least 1983, when a $47.4 million project was announced. The port's Pidjiguiti docks were the site of the Pidjiguiti massacre, which took place on 3 August 1959, when police shot the dockworkers, killing 50 and wounding over 100 people. The stevedores were on their first strike, organized by the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (Partido Africano da Independência da Guiné e Cabo Verde, PAIGC), marking the beginning of strong resistance against the Portuguese colonial authority. A large, black, fist monument commemorates the massacre. Several older buildings remain around the port area, including the 18th century military barracks and old prison. == Port operation == The Bissau port was designed to handle 5,000 containers a year, yet it serves nearly five times as many today.

On the publication of his first cartoon strip \\"Horror Sapiens \\" in 1977 Joachim Kupke was described as \\"Höllenfürst der Zeichenfeder\\" (The Prince of Darkness of the quill).Otto Pannewitz in: Gesamtwerk, Galerie der Stadt Sindelfingen, 2006, S. 5 * Cartoon, \\"Horror sapiens\\", 1977 * Cartoon, \\"Geschlossene Gesellschaft\\", 1983 During this period Kupke produced drawings and oil paintings, which grappled with paintings and art forms in unfamiliar and unusual ways. * Landschaft mit Seiltänzer, Oil on Canvas, 1979/ 1980 After a series of solo and group exhibitions, in 1981 Kupke received a grant from the Arts Foundation of Baden-Württemberg. This was followed by a stipend from the city Sindelfingen in 1986. In 1995 Joachim Kupke married Sarah Webb (born 1960 in Bedford, UK), the educationalist and actress. Sarah Kupke has lived in Sindelfingen since 1990, where she is the Head of the International School of Stuttgart, Sindelfingen Campus.Sindelfingen: Die halbe Welt in einer Klasse – Landkreis Böblingen – Stuttgarter Zeitung == Work == \\"To begin with, Joachim Kupke’s work is near to photorealism, with a penchant for ludicrous, interconnected motives, seemingly surreal and yet representing the artist’s intrinsic questioning behind the concept of \\"original\\". Also, his constant exploration into the nature of modern 20th century art itself. (...) The paradox of \\"original and reproduction\\" is part of life and art for Joachim Kupke, and prompts his playful exploration of the concept of \\"originality\\". \\"Joachim Kupke, Kate Moss in Delft, Text von Otto Pannewitz, Galerie der Stadt Sindelfingen, Lütze Museum 2014, . * Für Kläuschen ein schöner Hintergrund von Canaletto, pencil, crayon and paper, 1982 \\"Joachim Kupke’s works are created in an old master, realistic painting style. They use well-known works of art history, to which the artist feels an intimate relationship; a kind of kinship. They are not ironic re-creations or new creations. Rather, they have much more to do with the authenticity in what is represented and how it has been devaluated though mass media reproduction. Derived from our knowledge of the exponentially fragmentary nature of our perceptions and their connection with the widespread flood of pictures in all their reproduced manifestations, Kupke posits his technically brilliant commentary on art and art as art, about art. * Pour Robert Lebel, Oil on Canvas, 2003 This is also true for the nascent years of the series \\"Room in Delft \\". In these paintings Joachim Kupke transformed into the present, in his own inimitable way, one of the most important painters of European art, Jan Vermeer.\\"Joachim Kupke, Kate Moss in Delft, Text von Otto Pannewitz, Galerie der Stadt Sindelfingen, Lütze Museum 2014, .

He was nicknamed the \\"Fox\\" by the Germans, and personally led the longest successful raid of the war, lasting five months behind enemy lines. At the beginning of the war, Belov commanded the 2nd Cavalry Corps. During the Battle of Moscow it was renamed 1st Guards Cavalry Corps which played a pivotal role in stopping Guderian Panzers at Kashira near Tula in 1941, which led to the famous 5-month raid behind Army Group Center in 1942. After the end of the raid, he was given command of the 61st Army, which he led for the rest of the war. Belov's command of the army included the Battle of Kursk in 1943. He then took part in Operation Bagration and the Riga Offensive followed by the defeat of the German Pomeranian offensive in early 1945 and the Battle of Berlin. He has earned legendary status and is considered as one of the greatest Soviet cavalry generals of the Second World War along with Lev Dovator, Issa Pliyev and Viktor Kirillovich Baranov. ==Early life, World War I, and Russian Civil War== Born in Shuya on 18 February 1897, Pavel Alexeyevich Belov worked on a railway. Conscripted into the Imperial Russian Army in May 1916, Belov became a private in the 4th Reserve Cavalry Regiment. After graduating from the regimental training detachment in February 1917, he was sent to serve as a junior unter-ofitser with the 7th Marching Squadron of the 17th Hussar Regiment. Due to his above-average education, Belov was selected for a preparatory course at the 2nd Kyiv School of Praporshchiks in September. Granted leave in late November following the October Revolution, Belov did not return to the army. Conscripted into the Red Army in July 1918 during the Russian Civil War, Belov was appointed a Vsevobuch instructor in the Yaroslavl Military District, where he provided military training for railway workers. He commanded a platoon of the Separate Cavalry Battalion in Tambov from July 1919, and in February 1920 transferred to command a platoon of the 1st Reserve Cavalry Regiment of the Southern Front. Belov became secretary of the party bureau and regimental adjutant in May, and in October was transferred to the Caucasian Front, serving there as a squadron commander of the 1st and 2nd Reserve Cavalry Regiments. ==Interwar period== After the end of the war, Belov was appointed assistant commander of the 1st Reserve Cavalry Regiment of the 2nd Don Rifle Division in June 1921. In September of that year, he was transferred to the 14th Cavalry Division to serve as assistant commander of its 82nd Cavalry Regiment, and was later appointed commander of the 81st Cavalry Regiment. After graduating from the Cavalry Improvement Course for Senior Commanders of the North Caucasus Military District in August 1927, Belov was appointed commander of the 60th Separate Reserve Squadron of the 10th Cavalry Division (renumbered from the 14th), now stationed in the Moscow Military District. After serving as assistant chief of the 4th department of the staff of the district from May 1929, in June 1931 Belov became an officer for special assignments under Semyon Budyonny, who was then a member of the Revolutionary Military Council. In September 1932 he was appointed assistant inspector of cavalry with the Cavalry Inspectorate, before graduating from the Frunze Military Academy in 1933. Belov was sent to the 7th Samara Cavalry Division, stationed in the Belorussian Military District, in January 1934, serving as assistant commander and later succeeding to the command of the division. Having received the rank of kombrig when the Red Army introduced personal military ranks in November 1935, he became chief of staff of the 5th Cavalry Corps in July 1937, and participated in the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939. Promoted to komdiv, Belov became a major general in June 1940 when the army introduced general officer ranks, and in October of that year was appointed commander of the 96th Mountain Rifle Division of the Kiev Special Military District. In March 1941 he advanced to command the 2nd Cavalry Corps of the district. == World War II Operation Barbarossa=== After Operation Barbarossa began, Belov led the corps in fighting on the Southern Front, completing a number of combat missions to quickly cover the front of the 9th and 18th armies of the Southern Front and hold the line on the Dniester. He conducted a fighting retreat from Tiraspol to Kiev. During the Kiev operation, which ended in the defeat of Soviet troops in Ukraine, he waged successful defensive battles in the direction of Romny-Shtepovka, and even launched a strong counterattack in this area, which made it possible to save part of the encircled troops. During the summer-autumn battles of 1941, he was awarded the Order of Lenin. During the October 1941 German offensive towards Moscow, Army Group Center was stuck in the mud. These muddy periods are of particular interest because they enhanced the operations of the Belov's cavalry as it defeated the bogged down German 25th Motorized Division in September 1941. The mud caused quagmire was also a factor in the Soviet Army's failure to support Belov's 1st Guards Cavalry Corps' return to friendly lines after its five-month raid behind enemy German lines in April 1942. ===Battle of Moscow=== In September 1941, Belov's 2nd Cavalry Corps had been transferred to the Western Front to defend the approaches to Moscow. By late October, after fighting on the flanks of the German assault at Orel and Tula, the 2nd Cavalry Corps was withdrawn from the line and send into Stavka Reserve to be rebuilt. On 26 November, it was renamed the 1st Guards Cavalry Corps. The corps' divisions also received 'Guards' designations. The new honorific title did not come with new weapons. On the eve of the Moscow counter-offensive, Belov made a personal appeal, with Marshal Zhukov's support, directly to Stalin for the rearmament of his corps. Belov's men were armed primarily with rifles, giving the German infantry a clear advantage. After Belov's meeting with Stalin, he was promised 1,500 automatic weapons and two new batteries of new 76mm guns to replace his worn-out guns. He played a key role in stopping Operation Typhoon, the German codename for the assault on Moscow. Particularly in stopping Heinz Guderian Panzers outside of Kashira on the southern flank of Moscow. Guderian's penetration had culminated by forming a salient north-east of Tula, threatening the towns of Kashira and Riazan. The 2nd Panzer Army was poised to enter Moscow from the south and south-west. Guderian had attempted to seize Tula from the rear and was strung out without reserves. The corps along with the 50th Army and 10th Army were to hold out at all costs while the mobile of the cavalry along with the tanks began the offensive. By 5 December, Guderian's armored assault had ground to a halt against the stubborn defenses of Belov's 1st Guards Cavalry Corps outside of the important city of Kashira. The first stroke of the Western Front's counter-offensive on the outskirts of Moscow fell up Guderian's 2nd Panzer Army. The Germans in this sector had an advantage in men, equipment, and tanks where the average front line saw the disparity of 3-1 tanks in favor of Guderian. Not only did the corps heroically held its position after many German counter-attacks, but some units also managed to be the first to counter-attack on the night of 27-28 November, thus leading the Soviet forces as the vanguard. On the eve of 5 December, the 1st Guards Cavalry Corps reinforced with the 9th Tank Brigade lead the attack along with 173rd Rifle Division in the vicinity of Gritchino. On the Corps western flank was the 50th army that successfully defended Tula, it attacked along with the 10th army which covered Belov's eastern flank. The forces smashed against German 17th Panzer Division, 17th Motorized Division, and the 18th Panzer Division, which saw many towns and villages liberated. Many Soviet soldiers for the first time saw the horrors that were happening behind the rear; this motivated many to fight harder as many now understood that their relatives are suffering immensely under the occupation. The Guards then liberated the important city of Stalinagorsk after coming to the help of the 330th Rifle Division of the 10th Army, which unsuccessfully was trying to take the city. The cavalry used outflanking maneuvers and both parts I and II of the city were liberated in 4 days of intense fighting. Some local citizens also actively participated in the battle. While the Corp was pushing further in the direction of the south-west, the German 17th Panzer Division, 167th Division, and parts of 29th Motorized Division blew up a dam. Hoping to stop or at least slow Belov, however, due to the cold the water quickly froze and Belov's forces continued to pursue. Eventually, with the success of the 10th and 50th Armies the 1st Guards Cavalry Corp was able to drive the Germans the furthest from Moscow as far as 250 km, this event forced Hitler to sack Heinz Guderian on 25 December 1941. ===Battle of Rzhev and the Raid=== The winter of 1941-1942 was extremely severe. Mean temperatures near Moscow during January 1942 were -32 °F or -35 °C with the lowest temperature recorded on 26 January 1941 -63 °F/-52 °C. In the counterattack and the general offensive of Soviet troops in the western direction, the 1st Guards Cavalry Corps under the command of Belov distinguished himself more than once in battles: after the Rzhev-Vyazma operation (1942), being surrounded, he fought in the enemy’s rear for more than 5 months. Belov’s 1st Guards Cavalry Corps along with the 33rd Army controlled a pocket from south of Smolensk-Vyazma in size of 2 500 km²/1 553 mile² area. In his pocket, Belov mustered 2000 men from the cavalry, partisans, paratroopers, and riflemen, supported by a battalion of eight tanks including one KV heavy and one T-34 medium tank. A certain recognition of Belov's merits at the initial stage of the war may be the fact that the chief of the General Staff of the Wehrmacht, Franz Halder, repeatedly mentions the general in his diaries (much more often than any of the Soviet commanders), giving his actions a positive characterization. On June 16, General Franz Halder, head of the OKH, wrote in his operations diary: \\"Cav Corps Belov has again broken out and is moving in the direction of Kirov. Nothing we could brag about. Cav Corps Belov is now floating around the area west of Kirov. Quite a man, that we have to send no less than seven divisions after him.\\" Halder also wrote \\"Belov did it, after all, keeping seven German divisions on the jump.\\" The former Chief of staff of the Fourth Army wrote an appropriate tribute to Belov's accomplishments. \\"The episode cause many humorous remarks at the time and the motorized troops which had taken part in the operations became the butt of those jokes. I admire General Belov as a soldier and I was secretly glad he escaped. It was said he was received with all honors in Moscow and rightly so.\\" The 1st Guards Cavalry Corps escaped the pocket, although the 11th Cavalry Corps did not. ===From Kursk to Berlin=== From June 1942 until the end of the war, Belov commanded the 61st Army. The army fought defensive and offensive battles south and south-west of Bely until mid-1943. As part of the Bryansk Front, they participated in the Oryol Operation in July and August 1943. Commanding the 61st Army, Belov especially proved himself in the battle for the Dnieper: from September 26 to October 1, 1943, formations and units of the army crossed the Dnieper near the village of Lubech and captured the bridgehead on the right bank. For the successful crossing of the Dnieper, Belov was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Subsequently, the army took part in the Gomel-Rechitsa, Kalinkovichi-Mozyr, Belorussian, Riga offensive operations, the blocking of the Courland group, in the Warsaw-Poznan, East Pomeranian and Berlin offensive operations. ==Postwar== After World War II, he commanded the South Ural Military District for ten years. He then chaired the Voluntary Association for Support of the Army, Air Force, and Navy (DOSAAF). Belov retired from the military in 1960 and died on 3 December three years later. He was buried with military honors at the Novodevichy Cemetery. ==Awards and honors== ;USSR { - 20px Hero of the Soviet Union (15 January 1944) - 60px Five Orders of Lenin (11 June 1941, 2 January 1942, 15 January 1944, 21 February 1945, 28 February 1957) - 60px Order of the Red Banner, thrice (11 December 1941, 13 March 1944, 20 June 1949) - 60px Order of Suvorov, 1st class, thrice (23 August 1944, 6 April 1945, 29 May 1945) - 60px Order of Kutuzov, 1st class (27 August 1943) - 60px Medal \\"To a Partisan of the Patriotic War\\", 1st class (7 September 1943) - 60px Medal \\"For the Defence of Moscow\\" (1944) - 60px Medal \\"For the Capture of Berlin\\" (1945) - 60px Medal \\"For the Liberation of Warsaw\\" (1945) - 60px Medal \\"For the Victory over Germany in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945\\" (1945) - 60px Jubilee Medal \\"XX Years of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army\\" (1938) - 60px Jubilee Medal \\"30 Years of the Soviet Army and Navy\\" (1948) - 60px Jubilee Medal \\"40 Years of the Armed Forces of the USSR\\" (1958) - } ;Foreign Awards { - 60px Order of Sukhbaatar (Mongolia) - 60px Knight's Cross of the Virtuti Militari (Poland) - 60px Cross of Grunwald, 3rd class (Poland) - 60px Medal \\"For Warsaw 1939–1945\\" (Poland) - 60px Medal \\"For Oder, Neisse and the Baltic\\" (Poland) - } ==See also== * Georgy Zhukov * Vasily Chuikov * Ivan Konev * Konstantin Rokossovsky * Lev Dovator * Issa Pliyev * Viktor Kirillovich Baranov ==ReferencesSourcesPrinted=== * * ===Online=== * Category:1897 births Category:1963 deaths Category:People from Shuya Category:People from Shuysky Uyezd Category:Bolsheviks Category:Second convocation members of the Soviet of the Union Category:Third convocation members of the Soviet of the Union Category:Fourth convocation members of the Soviet of the Union Category:Fifth convocation members of the Soviet of Nationalities Category:Soviet colonel generals Category:Frunze Military Academy alumni Category:Russian military personnel of World War I Category:People of the Soviet invasion of Poland Category:Soviet military personnel of World War II Category:Russian people of World War II Category:Heroes of the Soviet Union Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin Category:Recipients of the Order of the Red Banner Category:Recipients of the Order of Suvorov, 1st class Category:Recipients of the Order of Kutuzov, 1st class Category:Knights of the Virtuti Militari Category:Recipients of the Order of the Cross of Grunwald, 3rd class Category:Burials at Novodevichy Cemetery ","title":"Pavel Belov"},{"id":"46834682","text":"The Copa del Generalísimo 1961 Final was the 59th final of the King's Cup.

During the club's first two seasons in the Greek National B League, 2007–08 and 2008–09, Lavrio ranked 6th in the final league standings. But the next season, 2009–10, it was declared the champion team of the category, after winning a tie-breaker with Panelefsiniakos (24 wins and 6 losses ). Therefore, for the first time in the club's history, it came up to the A2 National League. At the same time, in the organization of the Greek Cup, the club was eliminated after four games, losing in the 2nd leg of the second phase of the tournament against PAOK, by a score of 73–83. During its first season in the Greek A2 Basketball League, in 2010–11, Lavrio finished in 4th place in the league standings. In the Greek Cup, the club was eliminated on the 2nd game day, where they were defeated by a score of 69–63, against Nea Kifissia. The following season, 2011–12, while still competing in the same league category, they finished in 8th place in the league standings. In the course of the Greek Cup, they were eliminated on the 2nd game day of Phase A, after being defeated by a score of 74–59, against Panerythraikos. In the 2012–13 season, the team continued its good performances, and finished in 5th place in the final standings of the league classification tables. In the Greek Cup, they were eliminated at the first game of the second phase, when they were defeated by Ikaroi Serron, by a score of 64–60. In the 2014–15 season, Lavrio played in the Greek A2 League, and finished in third place in the league. Because the club KAOD withdrew from the top-tier Greek Basket League, Lavrio was then promoted to the top professional national basketball league in Greece, for the first time in its history. Lavrio managed to secure their place in the league for the next season one game before the end of the season, even though the team lost that game to Aries Trikala. The club finished the 2015–16 Greek League season in 11th place in the regular season. The club played in a European-wide competition for the first time in the 2018–19 season, as it competed in Europe's fourth-tier level competition, the FIBA Europe Cup. On September 20, 2018, Lavrio played its first European game which resulted in an 82–73 victory over BC Dnipro. ==Arena== Lavrio plays its home games at the Lavrio Indoor Hall, which has a seating capacity of 1,700. ==Sponsorship names== Due to sponsorship reasons, the club has known several names: *Lavrio DHI (2016–2017) *Lavrio MegaboltΕγένετο το \\"Λαύριο MEGABOLT\\" (2017–2018) *Lavrio Aegean Cargo (2018–present) ==Club honorsDomestic competitions=== *Greek 4th Division First Group Champion: (2006–07) *Greek 3rd Division Champion: (2009–10) ==Season by season== {  style=\\"font-size:85%; text- align:center\\" !Season !Tier !Division ! ! !Greek Cup !colspan=2European competitions - - bgcolor=#efefef2013–14  2  align=left A2 Basket League  10th  11–15   colspan=2  - bgcolor=#efefef2014–15  3  align=left A2 Basket League  BBF3BB\\" 3rd  18–8   colspan=2  - bgcolor=#efefef2015–16  1  align=left Basket League  11th  9–17   colspan=2  - bgcolor=#efefef2016–17  1  align=left Basket League  8th  11–17   colspan=2  - bgcolor=#efefef2017–18  1  align=left Basket League  6th  14–14   colspan=2  - bgcolor=#efefef2018–19  1  align=left Basket League  12th  7–19   align=left4 FIBA Europe Cup  - } ==Logos== GS Lavrio log.png Primary club logo (2013–17) GS Lavrio Megabolt logo.pngMegabolt sponsored logo (2017–present) ==PlayersCurrent roster=Depth chart=Notable players=== * border Sakis Giannakopoulos * border Michalis Perrakis * border Giannis Kouzeloglou * border Dimitris Kaklamanakis * border Nikos Barlos * border Christoforos Stefanidis * border Vangelis Sakellariou * border Vassilis Charalampopoulos * border Michalis Lountzis * 20px Milan Milošević * 20px Gilvydas Biruta * 20px Jito Kok * 20px Malik Dime * 20px Marko Kešelj * 20px Ashley Hamilton * 20px Kyle Allman Jr. * 20px Demarius Bolds * 20px Devin Davis * 20px Quenton DeCosey * border Sean Evans * 20px D.

Surviving records suggest various branches which all ended without male heirs, the lands going to daughters or sisters and their husbands. The family seems to have been initially associated, perhaps as under-tenants and maybe through marriage, with the Marmion family, witnessing charters alongside them in Normandy in 1106 and later occupying their land in England. The English branches may spring from William Aguillon (died after 1147), a descendant of the viscounts of Chaumont, who was seigneur of Trie near the French border with Normandy around 1119 and died on the Second Crusade. He married Margaret of Gisors and their son and heir was Enguerrand (died about 1196). (in French) (in German) Manser may have been a younger son. In England, family members can be found in four apparent groups but establishing definite connections between the four groups may be impossible. ==Aguillons in West Sussex and Hampshire== Manser (died after 1172), who before 1135 received two knight's fees in the honour of Arundel. and held a knight's fee from Robert Marmion of Tamworth in 1167. In 1172 he was liable by knight-service for castle-guard at Falaise. He had one known son and may have had two others: :Robert I inherited lands in West Sussex :William I :Richard I Robert I (died before 1195), son of Manser, in 1180 paid 15 marks to have seisin of Nutbourne in West Sussex and for leave to come to an agreement with his unnamed brother, who may have been William I. William I (died before 1226), possibly another son of Manser, in 1195 was claiming a knight's fee in Nutbourne against a later Manser and a Richard, He married Mary, daughter of Eustace de Valle Pironis, an otherwise unknown family name, and their sons were: :Reginald :probably, John. It may be this John who in 1221 had land at Maltby in Lincolnshire, or else it was his contemporary, the son of Richard I and Margery. Reginald I (died before 1240), son of William I and Mary, from 1220 to 1226 was bailiff of the honour of Arundel, being ordered by King Henry III in 1225 to arrest all ships carrying corn in various Sussex ports. In 1223 he bought land in Offham and in 1227 was given the manor of Up Marden by his mother, who had inherited it from her father. By 1240 his lands had been divided between his four daughters: :Mary, who married William Covert :Cecily, who married Peter Gatesden and later gave her part to the Knights Hospitaller :Godeheut, who married Ralph St Owen :Alice, who married first William Russell and secondly Robert Hackett. Richard I (died after 1228), possibly another son of Manser and possibly the Richard who asserted his right to a knight's fee in Nutbourne in 1206, married Margery, daughter of William Thorney, lord of Thorney, and his wife Mabel. Their sons were; :William II :John, whose daughter and heiress Sarah married William Whateman. William II (died after 1242), son of Richard I and Margery, before 1215 acquired the manor of Warblington which, together with lands in Emsworth, was confirmed to him in 1230. In 1242 he held three fees in Nutbourne, Up Marden, and Burpham and one-third of West Thorney. His son was: :Richard II. Richard II (died before 1308), son of William II, married Eleanor, who in 1308 held the three fees of Nutbourne, Up Marden and Burpham as his widow. She died before 1312, leaving them to her granddaughter Juliana, daughter of her deceased son Thomas, who herself died in 1312. William III (died before 1308), possibly a childless younger son of William II, in 1259 was made Keeper of Guildford Castle and was Sheriff of Surrey in 1261. In 1265 he had one-third of the advowson of West Thorney and in 1278 he held half the manor of Nutbourne. ==Aguillons in Surrey & East Sussex== William IV (died before 3 October 1244) may be the William who in 1219 with his wife Joan claimed the manor of Greatham in Hampshire. He inherited the lands of his mother-in-law and of his wife's grandfather, including the manor of Addington, which carried the duty of making a special dish to be served at the king's coronation and entitled the holder to attend Parliament as a baron, with William said to have taken his seat in 1233 and his son to have followed him after 1244. Shortly before his death, he received a pardon for crimes of murder and robbery which he had committed in 1227, after which he had fled the country and been declared an outlaw.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 8 July 1243 In 1212 he married Joan, widow of Ralph Parminter and younger daughter of Peter fitz Henry, the son of Henry fitz Ailwin and the husband of Isabel Cheney, heiress of Addington. Their son was: :Robert II Sir Robert II (died 15 February 1286), son of William II and Joan, had by 1248 inherited his father's manor of Perching in the West Sussex parish of Fulking and in 1260 acquired two-thirds of the neighbouring manor of Fulking, with the reversion of the other third. In 1264 he was licensed to enclose his manor house at Perching with a ditch and a stone wall, and to crenellate it, so marking the origin of Perching Castle. In 1281 he acquired further land in Perching and in 1284 was reported as holding the whole settlement. In 1248 he also obtained a grant of free warren in his demesne lands of Addington and in 1270 licence to embattle his house there. In 1267 he served as Sheriff of Surrey & Sussex and was Keeper of Guildford Castle. After 1265 he was granted lands at Berwick, East Sussex, taken from the rebel William Marmion, and was Keeper of Arundel Castle during the minority of its heir in 1272. In 1274 he did service at the coronation of King Edward I. After his second marriage to a rich widow, he acquired more landholdings: Portslade in Sussex and Wendover in Buckinghamshire, both in 1270,Calendar of Patent Rolls together with Stapleford in Hertfordshire, where in 1285 he held both manor and advowson. He first married by August 1256 Joan, widow of Sir John Mohun (died 1253) and daughter of William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby and his first wife Sibyl Marshal. After her death before October 1267, he married Margaret, widow of Baldwin de Redvers, 7th Earl of Devon, and daughter of Count Thomas II of Savoy and his second wife Beatrice of Fieschi. Margaret was a first cousin of Queen Eleanor of Provence and a grand-niece of Pope Innocent VI. She died shortly before 14 May 1292. His daughter and heiress, from his first marriage to Joan, was: :Isabel (born 25 March 1258 - died before 28 May 1323), who married Hugh, 1st Baron Bardolf. ==Aguillons in Norfolk & Suffolk== Reginald II (died after 10 August 1224), who may have been the son of William I and Mary, had lands in Norfolk in 1224. Sir Robert III (died before 1249) around 1217 founded Flitcham Priory. and before 1239 he and his wife confirmed a grant by her father to Sibton Abbey.Sibton Abbey cartularies and charters, Part 2, by Philippa Brown Before 1239 he was married to Margaret, daughter and heiress of William Fresnay, and then to Agatha, daughter and coheiress of Fulk Beaufoy, lord of Hockwold in Norfolk. After his death his lands were divided among his four daughters: :Ela or Isabel (died before November 1251), who before 1231 married Sir Thomas Poynings :Margery, who before 1239 married Sir Giles Argentine and, secondly, Sir Jordan Sackville of Buckhurst :Joan (died after 15 February 1263), who married Sir Ralph FitzBernard (their grandson was Bartholomew Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere) and after 1239 was married to Imbert Pugeys :Agatha, who married Sir Adam Cockfield. ==Aguillons in Warwickshire== Hugh (died 1284), held the manor of Upton and died without children, leaving a widow Ellen.

It is a revival of the earlier celebrity series of the same name, which aired for two series in 2005 and 2006 on ITV. The series is narrated by Iain Stirling, and was hosted by Caroline Flack until 2019; Laura Whitmore began presenting the series in 2020. The show has produced a considerable amount of controversy, with four people linked to the show having died by suicide. Former contestants Sophie Gradon and Mike Thalassitis had previously been found to have died by suicide after appearing on the show. After Flack's death, there were calls from some to cancel the programme. The series is the originator of the international Love Island franchise, with fifteen versions of it having been produced so far. ==History== On 13 February 2015, it was confirmed that Love Island would be returning, and would be aired on ITV2. However this series would include members of the public rather than celebrities. On 18 April 2015, it was announced that Caroline Flack would be hosting the show. The series finally returned on 7 June 2015 with a live special showing the new Islanders enter the villa. During the series a number of guests entered the villa including Calum Best, who was one of the Islanders in the original series back in 2005, and went on to win the series. Mark Wright also made a guest appearance in this series DJing for Lauren Richardson's birthday party. The series ended on 15 July 2015 and was won by Jess Hayes and Max Morley. Islanders Cally Jane Beech and Luis Morrison became the first couple from the show to have a baby together. The second series was confirmed on 14 February 2016, and began airing on 30 May 2016. This series featured the first Islander to be removed from the villa. Malia Arkian only spent a matter of hours in the villa before she was removed from the series by the producers after an altercation with Kady McDermott. It also included a number of Islanders who decided to voluntarily leave the villa, the first being Rykard Jenkins. Also during the series, Islander Zara Holland was stripped of her Miss Great Britain title due to her behaviour in the villa. The second series also included Sophie Gradon and Katie Salmon becoming the first same-sex couple on the show. The series was eventually won by Cara De La Hoyde and Nathan Massey on 11 July 2016. On 15 September 2018, the series runners-up Olivia Buckland and Alex Bowen married, becoming the first couple from Love Island to marry. The third series was confirmed on 14 February 2017, and began airing on 5 June 2017. This series was the first series to include a second villa, which was brought into the series during a twist set to put the couples to the ultimate test. This series also featured dumped Islanders Mike Thalassitis and Sam Gowland return to the villa after being voted back in by the public; a first for the show. The series ended on 24 July 2017 and was won by Amber Davies and Kem Cetinay. During the final Aftersun episode of the series, which was presented live from outside the villa, it was announced that there would be a one-off reunion special airing on 30 July 2017 which will include all of the Islanders from the series. The fourth series began on 4 June 2018, and launched with a record 4,050,000 viewers making it the most watched multichannel TV programme since the 2012 Summer Olympics were broadcast on BBC Three, and the most watched ever on ITV2. The series included the reintroduction of \\"Casa Amor\\" following its success in the previous series. The series concluded on 30 July 2018 and was won by Dani Dyer and Jack Fincham, who received a record breaking 79.66% of the final vote. It was also confirmed that another one-off reunion special would air a week after the final. As the fourth series began, the Islanders experienced tragedy with the suicides of Gradon and her boyfriend Aaron Armstrong, as well as the suicide of Thalassitis months after the series concluded. After the latter's death, the programme announced that they will offer counselling to all contestants in hopes of preventing further suicides. A fifth series was confirmed on 30 July 2018, which started broadcasting on 3 June 2019. The series increased upon the previous success of the fourth, gaining a record-breaking 4,700,000 viewers on TV sets and a further 1,400,000 viewers on other devices for the episode following Casa Amor, the most for any ITV2 broadcast. Furthermore, more than half of the viewers were in the 16 to 34 age bracket. The series concluded on 29 July 2019 and was won by Amber Gill and Greg O'Shea with a 48.82% share of the vote. On 24 July 2019, ITV announced that two series of Love Island would air in 2020 - one in the winter and another in the traditional summer slot. The winter series would be broadcast in January 2020 from a new villa in South Africa. On 17 December 2019, Flack announced that she would be standing down as host for the sixth series following allegations of assault towards her boyfriend, Lewis Burton. On 20 December, it was announced that fellow TV presenter Laura Whitmore would be standing in as the new host. On 15 February 2020, Flack was found dead in her London home, prompting ITV to pull two episodes from airing out of respect for the former host at the weekend. Series 6 continued from 17 February and Iain Stirling, the show's narrator, paid tribute to Flack saying he was devastated by the loss of his \\"true friend\\". Sponsorship adverts for fast-food company Just Eat have been replaced by a message telling people to be kind, with a contact number for the Samaritans.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51537641 On 4 May 2020, Love Island announced the cancellation of the summer 2020 show due to the coronavirus pandemic. Kevin Lygo, ITV's Director of Television said in a statement: \\"We have tried every which way to make Love Island this summer but logistically it's just not possible to produce it in a way that safeguards the wellbeing of everyone involved and that for us is the priority. In normal circumstances we would be preparing very soon to travel out to the location in Mallorca to get the villa ready but clearly that's now out of the question.\\" It has also been confirmed that the show will also not be airing a winter version of the series in 2021 due to uncertainties regarding the pandemic and international travel. The show is expected to return with an extended series in summer 2021. ==Format== Love Island involves a group of contestants, referred to as Islanders, living in isolation from the outside world in a villa in Mallorca, constantly under video surveillance. To survive in the villa the Islanders must be coupled up with another Islander, whether it be for love, friendship or money, as the overall winning couple receives £50,000. On the first day, the Islanders couple up for the first time based on first impressions, but over the duration of the series they are forced to \\"re- couple\\" where they can choose to remain in their current couple or swap and change. Any Islander who remains single after the coupling is eliminated and dumped from the island. Islanders can also be eliminated via public vote, as during the series the public vote through the Love Island app available on smartphones for their favourite couple, or who they think is the most compatible. Couples who receive the fewest votes risk being eliminated. Often a twist has occurred where it has been up to the Islanders to eliminate couples. During the final week, the public vote for which couple they want to win the series and therefore take home £50,000. During the first series, the Thursday episode was presented live by Caroline Flack where eliminations often took place and new Islanders entered the villa. However, from the second series onwards the live episodes were axed except for the final. Whilst in the villa, each Islander has their own phone in which they can only contact other Islanders via text – or receive texts informing them of the latest challenges, dumping or recoupling. Islanders and couples are typically faced with many games and challenges to take part in designed to test their physical and mental ability, with the winners getting special prizes afterwards. Some Islanders are also sent on dates outside the villa, or can win dates by winning challenges. ==Broadcast== The first series aired a nightly highlights show five days a week, from Sunday until Thursday. This is the only series so far to premiere on a Sunday, and to end on a Wednesday. The Thursday episodes in this series were live and often featured eliminations or new Islanders entering the villa. The launch and the final episode were also live. From the second series onwards, the live shows were axed except from the final. The series was also extended from five to six nights a week on air. The series can also be viewed from the ITV Hub, after it airs. All series have been made available to watch on Britbox and Hulu. ==Spin-offs== From the first series, a weekly re-cap episode entitled Love Island: The Weekly Hot List aired every Saturday and includes a round-up of everything that has happened in the villa over the past week. This also includes unseen footage. In May 2017 it was confirmed that a new spin-off show Love Island: Aftersun would air during the third series. It airs live on Sundays after the highlights episode and is hosted by main show host Laura Whitmore. It also includes celebrity guests, former Islanders and a studio audience. On 30 July 2017, Love Island: The Reunion was broadcast on ITV2, interviewing the islanders and remembering the most memorable moments from the third series. On 1 and 2 October 2017, Chris Hughes and Kem Cetinay starred in their own spin-off show, Chris & Kem: Straight Outta Love Island, which followed the popular double act as they write a rap song to perform at a Ministry of Sound club night. The two-part series also starred Chris and Kem's girlfriends from Love Island, Olivia Attwood and Amber Davies. It was broadcast on ITV2. In March 2018, a fly-on- the-wall documentary spin-off titled Chris and Olivia: Crackin’ On was aired and followed the life about contestants; Chris Hughes and Olivia Attwood after Love Island and their dramatic split. Unlike the other spin-offs and the main show, it was broadcast on ITVBe. Ahead of the fourth series in 2018, it was revealed that Kem would be returning alongside Arielle Free to present Love Island: The Morning After, a new daily podcast show delivering the freshest gossip to fans. The fifth series was the first not to include \\"The Weekly Hotlist\\", instead it was replaced by \\"Love Island: Unseen Bits\\". ==VillasSummer villa=== The summer villa—used for the series that take place during the summer—is located in Sant Llorenç des Cardassar, Mallorca, with 69 cameras filming the Islanders. It includes a bedroom and beds outside, but also has a Hideaway bedroom for couples to spend the night away from the others as a reward. It also includes an interview room where the Islanders are allowed to talk in private. This room is called ’The Beach Hut’. ’The Pod’ is also located inside the villa where Islanders can receive video messages from home, or receive other information from inside or outside the villa. During the third series, a second villa was introduced. The villa was called ’Casa Amor’ which translates to ’Love House’, and is located not far from the main villa. This was then reintroduced during all subsequent series as a regular feature for a few days during each series. ===Winter villa=== A new villa located in South Africa was introduced for the sixth series of Love Island, which began airing in January 2020. ==Series overview== {  style=\\"text- align:left\\" - !

Before her death, Gradon had spoken of the attacks she had received from online trolls as a result of appearing on the programme. Gradon's boyfriend also killed himself several weeks after her death. Some contestants have had revenge porn containing explicit images of them posted online and have received death threats. The show has received numerous complaints, with 4,100 people lodging official complaints about the 2018 series over issues such as the footage aired and how contestants have treated one another. The charity Women's Aid has criticised the treatment of female contestants by \\"controlling\\" and \\"abusive\\" male contestants. The Mental Health Foundation charity has also criticised the show for the negative impact it can have on viewers who feel insecure about their bodies. The show has also received criticism for its lack of body and ethnic diversity. The show's producers responded to this criticism by stating that the show was \\"aspirational\\" and that they \\"make no excuses\\" about having a cast of attractive people on the show. After host Caroline Flack's death in February 2020, there were calls from some to cancel the programme. Questions were raised about the pressures of the show, and many drew attention to how The Jeremy Kyle Show had recently been cancelled after the suicide of a participant. == Merchandise == Love Island Pool Party compilation albums have been released by Ministry of Sound since 2018. A Love Island app was released in 2017 by ITV Studios Global Entertainment, and Love Island: The Game was released in 2018 by Fusebox Games. ==Franchise== The series is the originator of the international Love Island franchise. A total of fifteen versions of the series have been produced internationally so far, including in the USA, Australia, and Germany among others. ==ReferencesCategory:2015 British television series debuts Category:2010s British reality television series Category:2020s British reality television series Category:British dating and relationship reality television series Category:English-language television shows Category:ITV reality television shows Category:Mallorca Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:Television shows set in Spain ","title":"Love Island (2015 TV series)"},{"id":"46835018","text":"Roger Stuart Woolhouse (1940-2011) was an English philosopher, an expert on empiricism and rationalism and a biographer of John Locke.

Jerry Tomko, the father of future Major League Baseball pitcher Brett Tomko, submitted the winning entry to name the team the \\"Cavaliers\\" through a competition sponsored by The Plain Dealer; supporters preferred it to \\"Jays\\", \\"Foresters\\" and \\"Presidents\\". Playing their home games at Cleveland Arena under the direction of head coach Bill Fitch, they compiled a league-worst 15–67 record in their inaugural season. The team hoped to build around the number one 1971 draft pick Austin Carr, who had set numerous scoring records at Notre Dame, but Carr severely injured his leg shortly into his pro career and never was able to realize his potential. ==1970–1980: The Austin Carr era== Austin Carr—the first overall pick in the 1971 NBA draft, a 1974 NBA All-Star, and longtime TV color analyst for the Cavaliers. The following seasons saw the Cavaliers gradually improve their on- court performance, thanks to season-by-season additions of talented players such as Bobby \\"Bingo\\" Smith, Jim Chones, Jim Cleamons and Dick Snyder. The Cavaliers improved to 23–59 in their sophomore season, followed by a 32–50 record in 1972–73, and 29–53 in 1973–74. In 1974, the Cavaliers moved into the brand-new Richfield Coliseum, located in rural Richfield, Ohio – south of downtown Cleveland in Summit County (now part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Park). The move was done as the Cleveland Arena had fallen into disrepair, and the location was chosen in an effort to draw fans in from nearby Akron and other areas of Northeast Ohio. That season, the Cavaliers finished with a 40–42 record, falling just short of a playoff berth. ===\\"Miracle of Richfield\\" season=== In the 1975–76 season with Carr, Smith, Chones, Snyder, and newly acquired Nate Thurmond, Fitch led the Cavaliers to a 49–33 record and a division title. Fitch received the league's Coach of the Year award as the Cavaliers got their first winning season, made their first-ever playoff appearance, and clinched their first Central Division Title. In the playoffs, the Cavaliers won their series against the Washington Bullets, 4–3. Because of the many heroics and last-second shots, the series became known locally as the \\"Miracle of Richfield.\\" They won Game 7, 87–85, on a shot by Snyder with four seconds to go. But the team became hampered by injuries—particularly to Jim Chones, who suffered a broken ankle. The Cavaliers proceeded to lose to the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals. It is widely believed among both Cavaliers fans and players that the \\"Miracle\\" team would have won the 1976 NBA Championship had Chones stayed healthy. Cleveland won 43 games in both of the 1976–77 and 1977–78 seasons, but both seasons resulted in early playoff exits. After a 30–52 season in 1978–79, Fitch resigned as head coach. ==1980–1983: Ownership under Ted Stepien== The following season, after going 37–45 under Fitch's successor Stan Albeck, original owner Mileti sold his shares to Louis Mitchell who sold the shares to minority owner Joe Zingale. In 1980, after just a few months, Zingale sold the team to Nationwide Advertising magnate Ted Stepien on April 12, 1980. Early on in his tenure, Stepien proposed to rename the team the \\"Ohio Cavaliers\\", part of a plan that included playing their home games not just in the Cleveland area but in Cincinnati and in non-Ohio markets such as Buffalo and Pittsburgh. He also made changes to the game day entertainment, such as introducing a polka-flavored fight song and a dance team known as \\"The Teddy Bears\\". Stepien also oversaw the hiring and firing of a succession of coaches and was involved in making a number of poor trade and free agent signing decisions. The result of his questionable trading acumen was the loss of several of the team's first-round draft picks, which led to a rule change in the NBA prohibiting teams from trading away first-round draft picks in consecutive years. This rule is known as the \\"Ted Stepien Rule\\". The ensuing chaos had a major effect on both the Cavaliers' on- court performance and lack of local support, going 28–54 in 1980–81 (Stepien's first year as owner), followed by an abysmal 15–67 mark in 1981–82. The 1981–82 team lost its last 19 games of the season which, when coupled with the five losses at the start of the 1982–83 season, constitute the NBA's second all-time longest losing streak at 24 games. Although the team improved its record to 23–59 the following year, local support for the Cavaliers eroded which eventually bottomed out that year by averaging only 3,900 fans a game at the cavernous (and isolated) Coliseum which seated more than 20,000. Though Stepien eventually threatened to move the franchise to Toronto and rename it the Toronto Towers - to the point that he had a Toronto Towers logo created \\\\- brothers George and Gordon Gund purchased the Cavaliers in 1983 and decided to keep the team in Cleveland (it would be another 12 years before Toronto finally got an NBA team in the form of the Raptors via expansion). As an incentive to the Gunds, NBA owners awarded the team bonus first-round picks for each year from 1983 to 1986 to help compensate for the ones Stepien traded away.\\"Ted Stepien, N.B.A. Owner, Is Dead at 82\\" NY Times September 15, 2007 ==1983–1986: The Gunds take over== Shortly after purchasing the Cavaliers in 1983, the Gunds changed the team colors from wine and gold to burnt orange and navy blue. Furthermore, they officially adopted \\"Cavs\\" as a shorter nickname for marketing purposes, as it had been used unofficially by fans and headline writers since the team's inception. Under the coaching of George Karl, the Cavaliers failed again, and missed the playoffs, with a 28–54 record, in the 1983–84 season. The Cavaliers finally returned to the playoffs in 1985, only to lose to the eventual Eastern Conference Champion Boston Celtics in the first round. At that point, the team was in transition, led by dynamic players such as World B. Free, Roy Hinson and John Bagley. But in 1986, Karl was fired after 66 games. Interim head coach Gene Littles guided the team the rest of the way, which saw the Cavaliers finish one game short of the playoffs. During the seven-season period, the Cavaliers had nine head coaches: Stan Albeck, Bill Musselman, Don Delaney, Bob Kloppenburg, Chuck Daly, Bill Musselman (again), Tom Nissalke, George Karl, and Gene Littles. The only playoff appearance earned during this stretch was during the 1984–85 season under Karl, losing to the Boston Celtics in the first round in four games (1–3). ==1986–1995: The Daugherty/Nance/Price era== Brad Daugherty, the first overall pick in the 1986 NBA draft and a five-time NBA All-Star for the Cavaliers During the 1986 NBA Draft, the Cavaliers acquired Brad Daugherty, Mark Price, and Ron Harper. They would also add Larry Nance just before the 1988 trade deadline, in a deal with the Phoenix Suns. Those four players (until Harper was later traded to the Los Angeles Clippers in 1989 for the rights to Danny Ferry) formed the core of the team, under the direction of head coach Lenny Wilkens, that led the Cavaliers to eight playoff seasons in the next nine years, including three seasons of 50 or more wins. In 1989, the Cavaliers were paired against the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls in the first round of the playoffs. In the fourth game of the best-of-five-series, Cleveland managed to beat the Bulls in overtime 108–105 to level the series at 2–2. Home court advantage went to Cleveland. The game was evenly matched, until Cleveland managed to score on a drive and raise the lead by one, with three seconds left. Chicago called for a time-out. The ball was inbounded to Michael Jordan, who went for a jump shot. Cleveland's Craig Ehlo jumped in front to block it, but Jordan seemed to stay in the air until Ehlo landed. \\"The Shot\\" went in as time ran out, with Chicago winning the series 3–2. The pinnacle of the Cavaliers' success came in the 1991–92 season, when they compiled a 57–25 record and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals, losing again to the Chicago Bulls, 4–2. Soon after, the Cavaliers entered into a period of decline. With the retirements and departures of Nance, Daugherty, and Price, the team lost much of its dominance and were no longer able to contest strongly during the playoffs. After the 1992–93 season, in which the Cavaliers had a 54–28 regular-season record but suffered an early exit from the playoffs in the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals to the Chicago Bulls, Wilkens left to coach the Atlanta Hawks. Following the hiring of Mike Fratello as head coach starting with the 1993–94 season, the Cavaliers became one of the NBA's best defensive teams under the leadership of point guard Terrell Brandon. But the offense, which was a half-court, \\"slow-down\\" tempo installed by Fratello, met with mixed success. Although the Cavaliers made regular playoff appearances, they were unable to advance beyond the first round. In the 1994 NBA Playoffs, the last which Daugherty and Nance played in, the Cavaliers yet again met the Chicago Bulls in the first round, led by Scottie Pippen in the wake of Jordan's first retirement. The Bulls proved that it was not just the \\"Jordan Curse\\", and would prevail yet again by sweeping the Cavaliers 3–0 in the first-round encounter. In 1994, the Cavaliers moved back to downtown Cleveland with the opening of the 20,562-seat Gund Arena. Known by locals as \\"the Gund\\", the venue served as the site of the 1997 NBA All-Star Game. The arena and the Cleveland Indians' Jacobs Field were built together as part of the city's Gateway project. ==1995–2003: Near Decade of strugglesMike Fratello years=== Žydrūnas Ilgauskas, a Cavaliers 1996 first-round draft pick, a two- time NBA All Star for the Cavaliers, and the team's all-time leader in games played, rebounds, and blocked shots. He is currently a Special Advisor for the Cavaliers. The Cavaliers revamped their starting lineup during the 1997 off- season, sending guard Bobby Phills, and forward Chris Mills to free agency, and trading Terrell Brandon and Tyrone Hill to the Milwaukee Bucks as part of a three-team trade. They acquired All-Star forward Shawn Kemp from the Seattle SuperSonics (from the three-team trade involving Cleveland, Seattle and Milwaukee) and guard Wesley Person from the Phoenix Suns. Later on, players like Kemp and Žydrūnas Ilgauskas added quality to the team, but without further post-season success. The Cavaliers did have five All-Stars/All-Rookies in 1998 with Kemp a starting All-Star for the East, Brevin Knight and Ilgauskas on the All-Rookie First Team, and Cedric Henderson and Derek Anderson on the All-Rookie Second Team. No other NBA team has ever been represented by five players at the All-Star celebration or four players as All-Rookies in the same year. Still, in the three seasons that Kemp played for the Cavaliers, they managed only one playoff appearance and one playoff win. Fratello was fired following the shortened 1998–99 season. ===Early 2000s struggles=== Despite the arrivals of Andre Miller, Brevin Knight, Lamond Murray, Chris Mihm and Carlos Boozer, the Cavaliers were a perennial lottery team for the early part of the 2000s. The 2002–03 team finished with the third-worst record in franchise history (17–65), which earned them a tie for last place in the league and a 22.5% chance at winning the NBA Draft Lottery and the first overall selection. Ricky Davis received national attention on March 16, 2003, in game against the Utah Jazz. With Cleveland ahead in the game 120–95, Davis was one rebound short of a triple-double with only a few seconds left on the clock. After receiving an inbound pass at the Cavaliers' end of the floor, Davis banged the ball off the rim and caught it in attempt to receive credit for a rebound. Utah's DeShawn Stevenson took offense to this breach of sportsman's etiquette and immediately fouled Davis hard. The play did not count as a rebound since firing at one's own team's basket does not count as a shot attempt, and doing so intentionally is a technical foul under NBA rules. Since the referees had never seen anyone shoot at his own basket before, they were unfamiliar with the rule and play was allowed to continue. This (which led to Davis being nicknamed in Cleveland as \\"Wrong Rim Ricky\\") and countless other acts contributed to the Cavaliers' trading of Davis later that year and ushering in a new type of team. ==2003–2010: The first LeBron James era== Cavaliers forward LeBron James, who was the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. In his first stint with the Cavaliers, he was the 2004 Rookie of the Year, a two-time NBA MVP (2009, 2010), a six-time NBA All Star, led the team to its first NBA Finals in 2007, and became the team's all-time leading scorer. Several losing seasons followed which saw the Cavaliers drop to the bottom of the league and become a perennial lottery draft team. After another disappointing season in 2002–03, the Cavaliers landed the number one draft pick in the NBA draft lottery. With it, the team selected local high school phenomenon and future NBA MVP LeBron James. As if celebrating a new era in Cleveland Cavaliers basketball, the team's colors were changed from orange, black and blue back to wine and gold, with the addition of navy blue and a new primary logo. James' status as both an area star (having played his high school basketball at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in nearby Akron) and as one of the most highly touted prospects in NBA history has led many to view his selection as a turning point in the franchise's history. Embraced by Cleveland as \\"King James\\", the 2003–04 season offered great hope for the future, as James rose to become a dominating player, winning the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. Hope was even greater for the 2004–05 season. James increased his production in terms of points, rebounds, and assists per game. Despite the loss of Carlos Boozer in the offseason, James teamed with Žydrūnas Ilgauskas and Drew Gooden to form the core of the team. After a promising start, the Cavaliers began a downward spiral that eventually led to the firing of coach Paul Silas and general manager Jim Paxson. The team failed to make the playoffs that year, tied with New Jersey Nets for the final playoff spot with identical 42–40 records; however, the Nets owned the tiebreaker due to having the better head to head record. ===Dan Gilbert takes over=== The Cavaliers made many changes in the 2005 offseason. Under new owner Dan Gilbert, the team hired a new head coach, Mike Brown, and a new general manager, former Cavaliers forward Danny Ferry. The team experienced success on the court in the following season, clinching their first playoff appearance since 1998. After a first round win over the Washington Wizards, the Cavaliers rebounded from a 0–2 deficit in the second round against the #1 seeded Detroit Pistons, winning three consecutive games to come one game away from the Conference Finals. They lost a close Game 6 at home, and followed it with a 79–61 loss in Game 7. The playoff rounds were a showcase for the emergence of James, who achieved many \\"youngest ever to...\\" records during the run. ===2006–2007: Eastern Conference champions=== The Cavaliers continued their success in the 2006–07 season. The team earned the second seed in the East with a 50–32 record, generating a series of favorable matchups in the playoffs. They battled 7th-seeded Wizards, who struggled with injuries near the end of the season. The Cavaliers swept this series 4–0, and defeated the New Jersey Nets, 4–2, in the second round. The Cavaliers faced the Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals. After again losing the first two games at Detroit, the Cavaliers won the next three to take a 3–2 series lead. This time, the Cavaliers eliminated Detroit in Game 6. The wins included a 109–107 double- overtime game at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Game 5, in which LeBron James scored the last 25 points for the Cavaliers, and his performance in this game is recognized as one of the best in NBA history. They continued to a dominant 98–82 win at home in Game 6. Rookie Daniel \\"Boobie\\" Gibson scored a career- high 31 points in the series clincher, and the franchise won its first ever Eastern Conference Championship. The team's first trip to the NBA Finals was a short one, as they were outmatched and outplayed by the deeper, more experienced San Antonio Spurs, who swept the Cavaliers 4–0. The Cavaliers took a step back in the 2007–08 season. They battled injuries and had many roster changes, including a three team trade at the trade deadline in which the team acquired F Joe Smith, G-F Wally Szczerbiak, F-C Ben Wallace, and G Delonte West. The Cavaliers finished 45–37 and lost in the second round against eventual champion Boston. The next off-season, the team made a major change to its lineup, trading G Damon Jones and Smith (who later in the season rejoined the Cavaliers after being released by Oklahoma City) for point guard Mo Williams. This trade was made in hopes of bringing another scorer to aid James. Two-time head coach Mike Brown, who in his first stint with the Cavaliers was NBA Coach of the Year for 2008–09, led the team to the 2007 NBA Finals, and was the head coach of the Eastern Conference for the 2009 All Star Game. ===2008–2010: High expectations=== In the next season, the Cavaliers made progress. They finished with a record of 66–16, the best regular-season record in franchise history. The year marked other notable franchise records, including a 13-game winning streak, and road and home winning records. The Cavaliers entered the playoffs as the #1 seed in the NBA with home court advantage throughout the playoffs. They finished the season 39–2 at home, one win short of the best all-time home record. Head coach Mike Brown won NBA Coach of the Year honors and LeBron James finished second in NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award voting and won the NBA Most Valuable Player award. The Cavaliers began the 2009 postseason by sweeping the 8th-seeded Detroit Pistons, winning every game by ten or more points. In the conference semifinals, the Cavaliers swept the 4th-seeded Atlanta Hawks, again winning each game by at least ten points, becoming the first team in NBA history to win eight straight playoff games by a double-digit margin. The Cavaliers then met the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Cavaliers lost Game 1 of the series 107–106 at home despite James' 49-point effort. Despite winning Game 2 by a score of 96–95, with the help of a James buzzer-beating three-pointer, it was not enough as Orlando won the series in six games. During the 2009 off-season, the Cavaliers acquired four-time NBA champion and 15-time All Star center Shaquille O'Neal from the Phoenix Suns. The Cavaliers also signed wingman Anthony Parker, and forwards Leon Powe and Jamario Moon for the following season. On February 17, 2010, the Cavaliers acquired All- Star forward Antawn Jamison from the Washington Wizards and Sebastian Telfair from the Los Angeles Clippers in a three team trade. The Cavaliers originally lost Žydrūnas Ilgauskas in this trade, but after being waived by Washington, he signed back with the Cavaliers on March 23 for the rest of the season. The Cavaliers managed to finish with the NBA's best record for the second straight season, with a 61–21 record. James was named the NBA MVP for the second consecutive year. The Cavaliers defeated the Chicago Bulls 4–1 in the first round of the 2010 NBA playoffs, but lost to the Boston Celtics in the semifinals after leading the series 2–1, with the Celtics proceeding to win 3 consecutive games (afterwards, the Celtics went to the 2010 NBA Finals and lost to the Los Angeles Lakers 4–3.) Each team would suffer record-setting playoff defeats on home soil; the Celtics lost by 29, 124–95, in Game 3, the greatest defeat in the history of the Boston Celtics in the playoffs, while the Cavaliers lost by 32, 120–88, in Game 5. ===The Decision=== With the Cavaliers out of the playoffs, the focus turned to James' impending free agency. On July 8, 2010, James announced in a nationally televised one-hour special titled The Decision on ESPN that he would be signing with the Miami Heat. The repercussions of this announcement left many in the city of Cleveland infuriated and feeling betrayed. A number of LeBron James jerseys were burned, and the famous Nike \\"Witness\\" mural of James in downtown Cleveland was immediately taken down. Shortly after James made his announcement, Dan Gilbert, the owner of the Cavaliers, announced in an open letter on the Cavaliers website that James' decision was a \\"cowardly betrayal\\" and promised an NBA Championship for the Cleveland Cavaliers before James won one, although James would win a championship before the Cavaliers with the Miami Heat in 2012. ==2010-2014: Life after LeBron2010–2011: Struggles and infamy=== Byron Scott, under whose watch the team went 64-166 and went through the (then) longest losing streak in major professional sports history at 26 During the 2010 off-season, before LeBron James left the team, the Cavaliers fired head coach Mike Brown, along with most of their coaching staff. General Manager Danny Ferry resigned on June 4, 2010, and Assistant General Manager Chris Grant was promoted to replace Ferry. On July 1, the Cavaliers hired former Los Angeles Lakers guard and former New Jersey Nets and New Orleans Hornets head coach Byron Scott as the 18th head coach in franchise history. The Cavaliers spent the rest of the 2010 off-season rebuilding their team after James' departure. They signed 2009 first-round pick Christian Eyenga and acquired Ramon Sessions and Ryan Hollins from the Minnesota Timberwolves in a trade that saw the Cavaliers give away Delonte West and Sebastian Telfair. The Cavaliers also signed free agent Joey Graham and undrafted rookies Samardo Samuels and Manny Harris. The Cavaliers were also active at the trade deadline in February 2011. They acquired former All-Star Baron Davis and a 2011 first round draft pick from the L.A. Clippers in exchange for Mo Williams and Jamario Moon. Kyrie Irving – the first overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft, the 2011–12 Rookie of the Year, a three-time NBA All Star, the 2014 All Star Game MVP, and was the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup MVP after helping lead Team USA to the Gold Medal. On the court, the 2010–11 season was a stark contrast from the previous season. They went from a league-best 61 wins in 2009–10 to a conference-worst 19, the biggest single- season drop in NBA history. This season also saw the Cavaliers lose 63 games, including a 26-game losing streak, which set an NBA record and tied the 1976–77 Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the longest losing streak in any American professional team sport. ===2011–2014: Rebuilding with Kyrie Irving=== David Griffin, who became Cavaliers GM in February 2014 Having the second-worst team record in the 2010–11 season as well as the Clippers' first-round pick that they received in the Mo Williams-Baron Davis trade, the Cavaliers had high odds of winning an early draft pick in the NBA Draft Lottery, with a 22.7% chance of their pick becoming number 1 overall.The chance of the Cavaliers' original selection being number 1 overall was 19.9% and the chance of the selection acquired from the Clippers was 2.8% The selection acquired from the Clippers became the first pick in the lottery, while the Cavaliers original selection ended up as the #4 selection in the draft. The Cavaliers took Duke Blue Devils guard Kyrie Irving with the first pick. With the 4th pick, the Cavaliers selected Texas Longhorns power forward Tristan Thompson. The Cavaliers used the next year to build around the two top-5 picks. They acquired small forward Omri Casspi and a lottery-protected first-round draft pick from the Sacramento Kings for forward J. J. Hickson. At the next year's trade deadline, the Cavaliers acquired forward Luke Walton and a first-round draft pick from the Los Angeles Lakers. The 2011–12 lockout shortened season was an improvement for the Cavaliers, as they finished 21–45. Irving was named NBA Rookie of the Year and was unanimously voted to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. Thompson was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team. For the second straight year, the Cavaliers had two first-round picks in the NBA draft. With their own #4 pick, they chose guard Dion Waiters from Syracuse, and with pick #17 (which was acquired from Dallas on draft night), they chose center Tyler Zeller from North Carolina. In August 2012, the Cavaliers signed veteran free agent swingman C. J. Miles. The team struggled in 2012–13, which led to them sacking head coach Byron Scott after a 64–166 record in three seasons. The following week, the Cavaliers rehired Mike Brown as head coach, making him the second two-time head coach in team history, after Bill Musselman in the early 1980s. The Cavaliers had several early picks in 2013. They won the 2013 NBA Draft Lottery to receive the first overall pick. They also had the 19th pick (acquired from the Los Angeles Lakers), as well as two out of the top three picks in the second round. For the third straight year, the Cavaliers had two picks in the first round of the NBA draft. The Cavaliers made somewhat of a surprise pick when they drafted forward Anthony Bennett of UNLV. This made Bennett the first Canadian born player in history to be the number one pick. With the 19th pick, the Cavaliers selected swingman Sergey Karasev out of Russia. The Cavaliers signed free agent forward Earl Clark to a two-year contract and veteran guard Jarrett Jack to a four-year deal.http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id?9455003/cleveland-cavaliers- reach-4-year-deal-jarrett-jack The Cavaliers also signed two-time NBA Champion and former All-Star center Andrew Bynum to a one-year contract. Bynum was then be traded on January 7, 2014, to the Chicago Bulls (along with draft picks) for two-time All-Star forward Luol Deng. The Cavaliers on February 6 fired GM Chris Grant. The team then announced that VP of basketball operations David Griffin would serve as acting GM. On May 12, 2014, the Cavaliers announced that Griffin had been named as the full-time GM, while also announcing that Mike Brown had been fired after one season in his second stint with the team following going 33–49. The Cavaliers won the #1 draft pick in the 2014 Draft Lottery, making it the third time in four years they would win the lottery. ==2014–2018: The return of LeBron James/Big 3 Era== Kevin Love (left), Kyrie Irving (center) and LeBron James (right) united in 2014 to form a \\"Big Three\\" in Cleveland The Cavaliers were perennial title contenders between 2014–15 and 2017-18 following the return of LeBron James to Cleveland. On July 11, 2014, James revealed via a first-person essay in Sports Illustrated that he intended to return to the Cavaliers. In contrast to The Decision, his announcement to return to Cleveland was well received. A day later, he officially signed with the team, who had compiled a league-worst 97–215 record in the four seasons following his departure. A month after James' signing, the Cavaliers acquired Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, forming a new star trio along with Kyrie Irving. ===2014–2015: Return to the NBA Finals=== The Cavaliers struggled over the first two months of the 2014–15 season. They were 19–16 on January 5, and fifth in the Eastern Conference. David Blatt's coaching job was in peril and the Irving/James/Love Big 3 wasn't clicking. That was the day general manager David Griffin saved the season with two moves. First, Dion Waiters was sent to the Oklahoma City Thunder in a three-team deal that landed J. R. Smith and Iman Shumpert. Then two days later, Griffin gave up two first- round picks for Denver Nuggets center Timofey Mozgov. The Cavaliers bottomed out at 19–20 on January 13 but were 32–9 the rest of the way. Irving proved to be a worthy partner for James during the 2014–15 season, as he ascended to James' level with a 55-point effort on January 28 against Portland and a 57-point effort on March 12 against San Antonio, which broke the franchise scoring record of 56 held by James. The Cavaliers entered the 2015 NBA playoffs as the second seed in the East with a 53–29 record. They advanced through the first three rounds of the playoffs virtually unchallenged, sweeping Boston in the first round, defeating Chicago in six games in the second round, and sweeping Atlanta in the Conference Finals to claim the franchise's second ever Eastern Conference championship and a trip to the NBA Finals. Games 1 and 2 of the NBA Finals saw a pair of overtime games, in which Game 1 went to the favored Golden State Warriors and Game 2 went to the Cavaliers. The Cavaliers went on to win Game 3 to take a 2–1 lead in the series, with James taking on the bulk of offensive responsibilities – through three games, James played 142 of 154 possible minutes, scored 123 points and took 107 shots. Despite taking the lead however, the Cavaliers went on to lose the next three games, as the Warriors took out the 2015 NBA Championship on Cleveland's home court in Game 6. The Cavaliers struggled without Love, who suffered a shoulder injury in the first round, and Irving, who fractured his kneecap in overtime of the first game of the Finals. To make matters worse, Smith and Shumpert had poor Finals campaigns, which led to players such as Matthew Dellavedova and James Jones playing roles that were beyond their capabilities. Despite the loss, James received serious consideration for Finals MVP after averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds and 8.8 assists over the six games. ===2015–2016: First NBA Championship=== Tyronn Lue took over as head coach midway through the 2015–16 season. The Cavaliers enter the 2015–16 season seeking redemption following a disappointing, injury-riddled exit from the NBA Finals. While the Cavaliers kept just five players in 2015, they had a returning cast of 11 players heading into the 2015–16 season. Love silenced many a doubter with his decision to sign a five-year deal to stay in Cleveland, spurning bigger markets and roles in the process. Smith, Shumpert and Dellavedova agreed to new contracts as well. During the 2015–16 season, James was criticized for his role in several off-court controversies, including the midseason firing of head coach David Blatt. Despite the Cavaliers' boasting the best record in the Eastern Conference at 30–11, Blatt was fired on January 22 and replaced by his assistant Tyronn Lue. The lack of chemistry and cohesion was the catalyst for the move. Lue had a firm, even- handed approach to coaching the Cavs, building trust within a team that often seemed on the verge of splintering. He managed egos, implemented an up-tempo offense and made some deft decisions. The Cavaliers entered the 2016 NBA playoffs as the first seed in the East with a 57–25 record, and once again advanced through the first three rounds of the playoffs virtually unchallenged, reaching the NBA Finals with a 12–2 postseason record, including winning 10 straight games as they threatened to sweep through the Eastern Conference playoffs. The 10–0 start to the playoffs saw Lue pass Pat Riley (9–0) for the most consecutive playoff wins to start a coaching career. In the NBA Finals, the Cavaliers faced a rematch with the Golden State Warriors. The Warriors, coming off an NBA-best 73–9 regular season record, raced to a 2–0 series after handing the Cavaliers back-to-back blowout losses in Games 1 and 2. The Cavaliers responded with a blowout win of their own in Game 3, before falling behind 3–1 in the series with a loss in Game 4. James and Irving responded in Game 5, with both scoring 41 points to lead the Cavaliers to a 112–97 win in Oakland. The pair became the first teammates to each score 40 points in an NBA Finals game. James continued his hot form in Game 6, as he put together his second consecutive 41-point game, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination. In Game 7 at Oracle Arena in Oakland, a number of key plays down the stretch in the fourth quarter put the Cavaliers in position for victory: James' chase-down block on Andre Iguodala with 1:50 to go; Irving's three-pointer with 53 seconds left that propelled the Cavaliers to a 92–89 lead; and Love's defensive play on Stephen Curry in the ensuing possession. Cleveland emerged victorious with a 93–89 win to earn the city's first professional sports title in 52 years. James was named the unanimous Finals MVP. James became the third player to have a triple-double in Game 7 of the NBA Finals, joining Jerry West in 1969 and James Worthy in 1988. He had 27 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists in the clincher, capping a series where the Cavaliers became the first team to successfully overcome a 3–1 deficit in the Finals. An estimated 1.3 million people attended the downtown victory parade on June 22. At the championship rally later that day, general manager David Griffin noted that \\"The Shot, The Drive, The Fumble all must now be replaced by The Block, the three, and the D.\\" ===2016–2018: Continued Eastern Conference dominance=== The 2016–17 season was marred by injuries and unexpected losses for the Cavaliers. LeBron James described it as one of the \\"strangest\\" years of his career, and felt the Cavs' roster was too \\"top heavy\\" after falling to 30–14 following a three-game losing streak in late January. The team had fickle chemistry and camaraderie out on the floor due to the constant changing of line-ups. The Cavaliers finished the regular season as the second seed in the East with a 51–31 record, after losing their final four games. Despite this, the Cavaliers rolled through the Eastern Conference playoffs, going 12–1 and putting up the best offensive efficiency in the history of the postseason through the first three rounds, besting the \\"Showtime\\" Los Angeles Lakers of the 1980s. However, they met their match in the 2017 NBA Finals, facing the Golden State Warriors in a highly anticipated rematch. The Warriors had gone 12–0 in their Western Conference playoff run, and took down the Cavaliers in five games despite James averaging 33.6 points, 12.0 rebounds and 10.0 assists to become the first player to average a triple- double in the championship round. In the 2017 off-season, Kyrie Irving demanded a trade, citing that he no longer wanted to play second fiddle to LeBron. Irving's wish was later granted, sending him to the Boston Celtics. Midseason saw a massive overhaul of the Cavaliers roster, such as trading Dwyane Wade to the Miami Heat, Isaiah Thomas to the Los Angeles Lakers for Larry Nance Jr. and Jordan Clarkson, and Derrick Rose and Jae Crowder were shipped to the Utah Jazz in exchange for George Hill. This new roster made the Cavaliers play better. They made it to the NBA Finals for the fourth straight year, only again to be stopped by the Warriors, who swept them 4–0. After the Finals, three frontrunners emerged as favorites to sign LeBron: The Cavs, Los Angeles Lakers, and Philadelphia 76ers. LeBron signed with the Lakers, leaving Cleveland again. Trying to stay competitive, the Cavs re-signed Kevin Love to 4-year, $120 million extension. ==2018-present: Rebuilding== After LeBron had left, Cleveland's plan was to remain competitive with Collin Sexton and Cedi Osman developing together and lead by Love, but unfortunately injuries to Love and Tristan Thompson derailed the Cavs season with few bright spots, such as Cedi performing in the Rising Stars Challenge. The Cavs would miss the 2019 NBA playoffs and receive the 5th pick in the 2019 NBA Draft, despite having the 2nd worst record. With the 5th pick in the NBA draft, the Cavs selected Darius Garland out of Vanderbilt, looking to pair him with Collin Sexton in the backcourt. The Cavs also had 2 other first round selections, taking two wings in Kevin Porter Jr. and Dylan Windler. The Cavs also hired John Beilein, previously head coach of the Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team. With pairing Sexton and Garland, as well as selecting Windler, Beilein stated favoring implementing a free flowing offense with multiple shooters on the floor together. During the 2020 NBA trade deadline, the Cavaliers acquired 2-time All Star Andre Drummond from the Detroit Pistons to pair alongside Love, Sexton, and Garland. ==See also== * History of Cleveland ==References== Category:Cleveland Cavaliers Cleveland ","title":"History of the Cleveland Cavaliers"},{"id":"46835052","text":"Nicolae Grigore (born 12 March 1975 in Sibiu) is a former Romanian football player. ==References== Category:1975 births Category:Sportspeople from Sibiu Category:Romanian footballers Category:FC Spartak Vladikavkaz players Category:Russian Premier League players Category:Romanian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Russia Category:FC Unirea Alba Iulia players Category:FC SKA-Khabarovsk players Category:CSU Voința Sibiu players Category:Living people Category:Association football defenders ","title":"Nicolae Grigore (footballer, born 1975)"},{"id":"46835117","text":"Cora Amalia Castilla Madrid (27 January 1961 in Chetumal, Quintana Roo) is a Mexican politician and activist.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The library is managed by the Bloomfield Academy Trustees. ==Architecture and history== The library is located on the north side of Elm Street, just west of its junction with Madison Avenue (United States Route 201), and overlooking the Kennebec River. The building is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, with asymmetrical massing characteristic of the Queen Anne period. Its main block has a hip roof, with a projecting gable section at the left side of the front (south- facing) facade, and an octagonal tower projecting forward from the right side of the facade, with then entrance between these two elements. An ell extends to the rear of the main block. The gable section has bands of three sash windows on both levels, with a large semicircular terra cotta panel above. The first-floor windows are in segmented-arch openings. The entrance is set in a terra-cotta arch, which was originally open but has since been closed in. The tower at the right has an entablature with terra cotta decoration below its octagonal pyramidal roof. The library in 2018 The building's interior is of extremely high quality and preservation.

He was educated at Charterhouse School. After a short period at Pembroke College, Cambridge in the early 1660s, he moved on in Lent term 1660 to New Inn Hall, Oxford, and graduating B.A. on 15 October 1664, M.A. on 20 June 1667. Two years later he was ordained deacon by John Hacket, Bishop of Lichfield, and in the same year priest by Joseph Henshaw, Bishop of Peterborough, on his institution to the benefice of Martinsthorpe. He became chaplain to Sir Richard Temple, 3rd Baronet (1634–1697), and was made curate of Stowe. ==Deprived as nonjuror== In 1684 Wagstaffe was preferred to the chancellorship of Lichfield Cathedral and a prebend, by James II, Bishop Thomas Wood being incapacitated through suspension. In the same year, also at the presentation of the king as patron of the rectory of St. Gabriel Fenchurch, London (with St. Margaret Pattens); he was deprived at the Glorious Revolution of both posts, since he refused to take the new oaths. For some time he made his living by practising as a physician, still wearing clerical dress, and treating William Sancroft and Francis Turner, Bishop of Ely. With Archbishop Sancroft he spent some time before his death at Fressingfield in Suffolk. ==Nonjuring consecration== In 1693 the nonjurors exploited the Suffragan Bishops Act of Henry VIII, not in force since the reign of Queen Elizabeth, to continue a succession of their bishops. George Hickes went over to Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France in 1693 with a list of nonjurors, from which James II selected the names of Hickes himself and Wagstaffe as bishops. Nonjurors held that James was king, in law, and William Lloyd, whose suffragans the new bishops were to be, was Bishop of Norwich (Sancroft still being regarded as Archbishop of Canterbury); so it was held that the conditions of the act were duly complied with. Before giving his consent James had the approval of Pope Innocent XII, François de Harlay de Champvallon, and Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet. Wagstaffe therefore was nominated bishop of Ipswich, and Hickes of Thetford, both in the diocese of Norwich. Their consecrations took place on 24 February 1694, at the house of the Rev. Mr. Giffard at Southgate in the parish of Enfield, near London, which apparently was occupied by White, the deprived bishop of Peterborough. A third supposed bishop—Lloyd of Norwich taking the lead—took part in the ceremony, Francis Turner, deprived of Ely. The service was quite private, and the consecrations were for a long time unknown to some of the leading nonjurors. Hearne, who at Oxford was in frequent communication with Hickes and Wagstaffe, knew nothing of these consecrations as late as 1732. The only persons present were, besides the bishops, Lord Clarendon and a notary named Douglas. Wagstaffe joined with the former in attesting Hickes's deed of consecration, Hickes doing a like service for him. There is no record of Wagstaffe performing any episcopal duties. There were no consecrations during his lifetime, nor does it appear that he ordained any of the few admitted to holy orders during that time. ==Later life== Wagstaffe passed much of the rest of his days in Warwickshire, but was present when holy communion was given to John Kettlewell on his deathbed in London in 1695. In the following year, after a warrant for his arrest, he appeared with Thomas Ken and three more of the deprived bishops, besides others, before the privy council. He was there to defend his share in a charitable recommendation of the nonjuring clergy and their families. He was released, with the others, on 23 May. The Post Boy of 23–5 October 1712 recorded his death: > \\"On Friday the 17th instant died the Reverend Dr. Wagstaffe, at his house at > Binley, near Coventry. He was a person of extraordinary judgment, exemplary > piety, and unusual learning; and had he not had the misfortune to dissent > from the established government by not taking the oaths, as he had all the > qualities of a great divine, and a governor of the church, so he would have > filled deservedly some of the highest stations in it.\\" He had a good library, which was sold in London by Fletcher Gyles in 1713. ==Works== Wagstaffe was the author of a series of religious and political pamphlets. These included his prominent Vindication of King Charles the Martyr (1693). ===Eikon Basilike controversy=== The authorship of Eikon Basilike, a work of royalist apologetics published in 1649 shortly after the execution of Charles I, flared up as a topic of controversy in the 1690s. In Vindication of King Charles the Martyr, proving that his Majesty was the author of Εἰκὼν Βασιλική,London, 1693; another edit. 1697; Wagstaffe published A Defence of the Vindication in 1699 Wagstaffe defended the authorship of Charles I. There was a claim that a particular prayer in the work had been plagiarised: in the second edition (1697) of his work, Wagstaffe sourced an explanation to Henry Hills, parliamentarian printer. Hills had heard it from Thomas Gill and Francis Bernard, physicians. Wagstaffe accused John Milton and John Bradshaw of deliberate insertion into the work; and stated that Milton had used William Dugard to implement the insertion of the prayer. A few years later, Wagstaffe returned to the table-turning attack on Milton's integrity, in replying to the Amyntor of John Toland. It became a commonplace of Jacobite propaganda, and was used by Ned Ward. ===Other works=== Wagstaffe gave an account of Archbishop Sancroft's illness and death, in A Letter out of Suffolk (1694; reprinted in Somers's Tracts, 1751). His Present State of Jacobitism in England (1701?), was in answer to Gilbert Burnet, who had advised the nonjurors to end their troubles by taking the oaths. Wagstaffe contrasted the severity with which the nonjurors were treated with the comparative leniency of Cromwell under the Commonwealth, or Elizabeth, towards Catholics. Burnet replied in The Present State of Jacobitism in England. The Second Part). Other pamphlets were: *A Letter to the Author of a late Letter out of the Country occasioned by a former Letter to a Member of the House of Commons concerning the Bishops lately in the Tower and now under Suspension (1690?); *An Answer to a late Pamphlet entitled “Obedience and Submission to the present Government demonstrated from Bishop Overall's \\"Convocation Book\\",” with a postscript in answer to Dr. Sherlock's “Case of Allegiance,” London, 1692; *An Answer to Dr. Sherlock's \\"Vindication of the Case of Allegiance due to Sovereign Powers\\" made in Reply to an Answer to a late Pamphlet entitled ”Obedience and Submission to the present Government demonstrated from Bishop Overall's \\"Convocation Book\\",’ with a postscript in answer to Dr. Sherlock's \\"Case of Allegiance\\", London, 1692; *An Answer to a Letter of Dr. Sherlock written in Vindication of that part of Josephus's \\"History\\" which gives the Account of Jaddas' Submission to Alexander, in answer to the piece entitled \\"Obedience and Submission to the present Government\\" (1691); *Remarks on some late Sermons, and in particular on Dr. Sherlock's Sermon at the Temple, December the 30th, 1694, in a Letter to a Friend (1695); *A Letter to a Gentleman elected a Knight of the Shire to serve in the present Parliament, London, 1694; *An Account of the Proceedings in Parliament in relation to the Recoining of Clipped Money, London, 1696 (1696; another edit. 1697–8; a proclamation was issued in 1696 by the king for the discovery of the author of the pamphlet, which was published anonymously). Some works published under the name of Samuel Grascome have also been attributed to Wagstaffe. ==Family== Wagstaffe married Martha Broughton, by whom he had four sons and five daughters. His first-born son died in infancy. The second son, Thomas Wagstaffe (1692–1770), was another prominent nonjuror. One of his daughters married Dr. William Wagstaffe: encouraged by Wagstaffe, William Wagstaffe went to London and later secured appointment as physician to St. Bartholomew's Hospital. The wife died not long after the marriage, and he remarried, to a daughter of Charles Bernard. ==Notes== Attribution Category:1645 births Category:1712 deaths Category:People educated at Charterhouse School Category:Alumni of Pembroke College, Cambridge Category:English nonjuror clergy Category:People from Warwickshire Category:18th-century bishops Category:English bishops Category:18th-century English Anglican priests ","title":"Thomas Wagstaffe"},{"id":"46835235","text":"Madame Tussauds San Francisco is a wax museum located in Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco in California.

A 4-track reel-to-reel release was subsequently issued by Music Tapes, Inc. The album is noted for its marked turn towards a heavier sound in comparison to earlier Ventures releases, and the standout track Wild Child which was prominently featured as a sample in \\"Start the Commotion\\" by The Wiseguys. ==Background== Recorded directly after completing a tour of the central United States in the summer of 1966, the album presents The Ventures updating their sound to a \\"mod, go-go\\" style. Allmusic notes that the album is consistently \\"hard-edged\\" thanks to fuzztone Mosrites, and that the original instrumentals are better than throw-a ways. Leading off the album is a cover of The Troggs' \\"Wild Thing\\". The track features a \\"vocal\\" by Don Wilson, doing an impersonation of Peter Lorre reciting parts of the original lyrics, to humorous effect. The next track, \\"Fuzzy and Wild\\", is the first of the original instrumentals, each of which included the word \\"wild\\" in the title. \\"Wild and Wooly\\" was not a Ventures original, but was originally called \\"Murfreesboro\\" by its composer, Danny Hamilton. Perhaps the oddest title belongs to \\"How Now Wild Cow\\", a play on the phrase of elocution suggested by one of Mel Taylor's sons. ===\\"Wild Child\\"=== The track \\"Wild Child\\", featuring a \\"catchy guitar loop\\", was prominently featured in The Wiseguys' 1999 song \\"Start the Commotion\\". The Wiseguys' recording was subsequently used in a television commercial for Mitsubishi automobiles, and in a promo for Ally McBeal; this exposure ushered in a new chapter into the Ventures' career. Having been alerted to the use of their recording, The Ventures confirmed with EMI that they owned rights to their composition, and subsequently received two-thirds of the writing royalties for \\"Start the Commotion\\". Additional income for The Ventures came in the form of synchronization rights from the song. The Ventures at this point realized that royalties from their back catalog, as well as performing new music specifically designed for use in multimedia productions, could produce a significant source of additional income. ==Reception== Wild Things! first appeared on the Billboard Top Albums chart on September 17, 1966. It maintained a position on this chart for a sum of 26 weeks, achieving a top position of #33.The Billboard Albums, 6th edn. Joel Whitburn. 2006. Record Research Inc. p. 1101. .

She was involved in several major campaigns to improve women's rights in 19th-century Britain, and has been noted as one of the leading citizens of Edinburgh. Her stepmother, Jane Smeal, was a leading activist in Glasgow, and her brother John Richardson Wigham was a prominent lighthouse engineer. ==Life== Eliza Wigham was born on 23 February 1820 in Edinburgh to John Tertius Wigham, a cotton and shawl manufacturer, and Jane (née Richardson). The family grew to include six children, residing at 5 South Gray Street in Edinburgh.S. E. Fryer, 'Wigham, John Richardson (1829–1906)', rev. R. C. Cox, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 3 June 2015 The Wighams were a part of a network of leading Quaker anti-slavery families of the period operating in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Newcastle, and Dublin. Eliza's mother, older sister, and younger brother died when she was around ten years old. In 1840 her father remarried to Jane Smeal. ==Campaign work== Wigham was the treasurer of the Edinburgh Ladies' Emancipation Society. Unlike other abolitionist organisations which splintered, the Edinburgh organisation was still running in 1870. Credit for this is given to Wigham and her stepmother Jane Smeal.Eliza Wigham , The Scottish Suffragists. Retrieved 30 May 2015 In 1840, Wigham and her friend Elizabeth Pease Nichol travelled to London to attend the World Anti-Slavery Convention, which began on 12 June.

Eliza and her friend Agnes McLaren became the secretaries,National Society of Women's Suffrage. Examiner; 14 Jan 1871; 3285; British Periodicals pg 55 Priscilla Bright McLaren was the president, and Elizabeth Pease was the treasurer. In 1863 Wigham served on the committee of Clementia Taylor's Ladies' London Emancipation Society with Mary Estlin. In the same year, she wrote The Anti-Slavery Cause in America and its Martyrs, a short book intended to influence the British government. At the time it was feared that Britain might side with the Confederates in the American Civil War and thus would be supporting slavery. Wigham was also involved with the campaign to repeal acts of Parliament which aimed to contain prostitution. The Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts was formed in response to these acts, and was successful in its aims. ==Life as a carer== Eliza Wigham and her sister Mary Edmundson Wigham's father died in 1864, after which Eliza continued to live at her stepmother Jane's house on South Gray Street in Edinburgh. She cared for Jane until the latter died in November 1888 following months of ill health. After her brother's death in 1897, Eliza sold the property to enable her to move to Dublin, where she could in turn be cared for by her relatives. Wigham died in Foxrock near Dublin in 1899.Lesley M. Richmond, 'Wigham, Eliza (1820–1899)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 30 May 2015 ==Legacy== A memorial book for Wigham was published in 1901.

She was educated as a Quaker at Ackworth School in Yorkshire. The family resided in Edinburgh, later moving to Aberdeen. As Quakers, Smeal's family were unusual in Scotland. The 1851 census shows that there were fewer than 400 active Scottish Quakers at the time. Smeal became the leader and secretary of the radical Glasgow Ladies Emancipation Society. Her brother William in 1822 founded the Glasgow Anti- Slavery Society, a forerunner of the Glasgow Emancipation Society, and was later active in the latter.Women on the Platform, DRBs Scottish Women’s History Group. Retrieved 3 June 2015 Smeal had a record of anti-slavery activity, long before the Free Church became involved in the issue. In 1838 she published an important pamphlet with Elizabeth Pease of Darlington titled Address to the Women of Great Britain. This document called for British women to speak in public and to form anti-slavery organisations for women. An address that Smeal prepared for Queen Victoria has been credited with being the \\"final blow\\" that ended slavery in the Caribbean. In 1840 Smeal became the second wife of the Quaker John Wigham, who was a tea merchant and active abolitionist in Glasgow. Wigham had lost two of his children and his wife in 1830, but the family was revitalized when he married Smeal. Jane Smeal became Jane Wigham and she formed a close friendship and collaboration with her stepdaughter, Eliza Wigham. Smeal and Wigham's marriage took place in the same year as the World's Anti-Slavery Convention in London, where Eliza was one of the delegates. After the Ladies' Emancipation Society ceased activity, Jane and Eliza, along with some of their friends, set up the Edinburgh chapter of the National Society of Women's Suffrage. Priscilla Bright McLaren, the president, Elizabeth Pease, the treasurer, and McLaren's daughter Agnes McLaren joined Eliza as joint secretaries.National Society of Women's Suffrage.

She was a member of the Edinburgh Ladies' Emancipation Society and, after serving on the committee, became the president of the Edinburgh Women's Suffrage Society. ==Biography== She was born Priscilla Bright in Rochdale, Lancashire. She came from a Quaker family that believed in educating its women. Her father, Jacob Bright, had risen from weaver to bookkeeper to wealthy cotton manufacturer. His politics remained radical and he passed his activist interest to his children. Her mother, Martha, took an equal part in her husband's business concerns and created essay societies and debating clubs for her children. Skills that they developed in addressing an audience were later put to use by the daughters Margaret and Priscilla, as well as the most famous of the Bright sons, Radical MP John Bright. Priscilla Bright McLaren Priscilla kept house for her brother, John, including looking after her niece Helen Bright Clark and believed that she had missed her own chance for a family life, but when John remarried, Priscilla accepted a suitor she had turned down twice before. Duncan McLaren was a twice-widowed Edinburgh merchant. He was considerably older than Priscilla and she became stepmother to his five children. For accepting Duncan on his third proposal, Priscilla was disowned by the Society of Friends (though she ignored this for the most part, continuing to attend Quaker meetings). Duncan built a political career as an alderman, Lord Provost, and then Liberal Member of Parliament in 1865. They worked together on many campaigns, described by contemporaries as 'equal partners'. They had three children together and lived at Newington House.

It was formerly known as the Victoria Hospital for Incurables. Today, the hospital is primarily dedicated to medicine for the elderly. It is managed by NHS Tayside. ==History== The hospital has its origins in a body called the Society in Aid of Incurable Persons in Dundee and District. This was set up around 1896 and raised funds to acquire Balgay House, in Dundee's Jedburgh Road. This building, thought to date from around 1760, was then extended and adapted into a hospital for Incurables which was opened on 26 August 1899. In 1900 it was renamed the Royal Victoria Hospital,after Queen Victoria, but continued to be run by the society. In 1928 a Royal Charter by King George V made the Society into a Body Corporate and Politic under the title 'The Royal Victoria Hospital, Dundee'. James Ernest Cox (1876-1950), one of the Cox family of textile barons, was at one time vice president of the hospital. From its foundation until was transferred to the administration of the newly formed National Health Service in 1948 the Hospital principally offered long-term nursing care for about fifty terminally ill patients. Upon the creation of the National Health Service the hospital was run by the newly formed Dundee General Hospitals Board of Management. In 1959 a geriatric ward was added. In 1980 the patients of Sidlaw Hospital were transferred to Victoria on the former's closure. By the twenty-first century Royal Victoria was mainly being used as a hospital for patients over the age of 65. ==Services== The hospital also houses a Centre for Brain Injury Rehabilitation. The hospital grounds are home to Roxburghe House, a Palliative Care Unit which includes 24 in-patient beds. The grounds of the hospital are also the location of a Macmillan Daycare Unit. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Unlocking the Medicine Chest – Royal Victoria Hospital *Entry on NHS Tayside Website Category:Hospitals in Dundee Category:NHS Tayside Category:Hospitals established in 1896 Category:1896 establishments in Scotland Category:NHS Scotland hospitals ","title":"Royal Victoria Hospital, Dundee"},{"id":"46835562","text":"Persiaran Wawasanhttp://www.federalgazette.agc.gov.my/outputp/pua_20130115_P.U.%20(A)%2011_PERINTAH%20JALAN%20PERSEKUTUAN%20(MALAYSIA%20BARAT)%20(PINDAAN)%202013.pdf, Federal Route 262, is a federal road in Kangar, Perlis, Malaysia.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from Afghanistan. It has tall, green curved leaves, tall slender stems and purple blue or violet-blue flowers, with white and purple or lilac beard. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. ==Description== It is similar in form to Iris falcifolia (in the Hexapogon Section) but differs in having a looser rhizome system and the leaves are also different.British Iris Society (1997) It has a small and slender rhizome, that is 0.5 cm in diameter. It has several stolons (branches), that are between 1–5 cm long. On top of the rhizome, are the fibrous remains of last seasons leaves. It has 4–7, grey-green, or green leaves.James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees, H. Suzanne Cubey (Editors) They are falcate (or sickle shaped), with membranous margins. The leaves can grow up to long, they are shorter (than the flowering stem) at the time of blooming. They are between 0.2 – 0.5 cm wide. It has a stem that can grow up to between tall, but occasionally they can reach up to tall. The stem has spathes (leaves of the flower bud), that are long. The stems hold 1–3 terminal (top of stem) flowers, blooming late spring, or May. The flowers are in diameter, come in shades of purple blue, or violet-blue flowers It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The falls are elliptic and oblanceolate shaped and long, and between 1.25–1.5 cm wide. It has a sharply reflexed blade and dense central beard of white hairs, which are tipped in purple or lilac. The haft (section closest to the stem) is whitish veined with purple. The erect standards are narrowly obovate and long, and between 1–1.25 cm wide. It has a cuneate (wedge shaped) haft with sparse beard extending onto blade. It has a 1.5 cm long perianth tube and a 1.4 cm long pale purple style, that is elliptical (in shaped) and has slightly wavy margins. It is also tri-lobed and the lobs are triangular and 0.9 cm long. It has a 0.5 cm long white filament, 1.1–1.3 cm long anthers and creamy white pollen. After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule, which is 3.5 cm long and 1.5 cm wide. It has a short pedicel and the remains of the perianth tube can still be found at the top of the capsule. Inside, are 0.4 cm long and 0.25 cm wide, dark brown seeds, which are rough coated with white aril (appendage). ===Biochemistry=== As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count: 2n = 22 == Taxonomy== The Latin specific epithet heweri refers to Professor Thomas Frederick Hewer (born 12 April 1903 - 15 March 1994), who became a practising pathologist in 1935. He was then appointed senior lecturer in pathology at the University of Liverpool. When he retired in 1959, he went on several plant hunting expeditions to the Alps, Eastern Europe, Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan. He collected over 4800 specimens (pressed and living). These new found plants were given to the botanical gardens at Kew, Edinburgh and Cambridge. He also discovered 20 new plant species, three of which; Iris heweri, Acantholimon heweri and Bellavalia heweri, were later named after him. Specimens of Iris heweri were originally collected by Prof Hewer in 1969. It was first published and described by Grey-Wilson and Mathew in Kew Bulletin Vol.29, page67 on 27 June 1974. It was also published in the 'Iris Year Book', pages106 and 117 in 1973. An illustration of the iris, was published in the 'Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society' Vol.99, page87 in 1974. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then updated on 2 December 2004. Iris heweri is an accepted name by the RHS. ==Distribution and habitat== It is native to temperate Asia. ===Range=== It is found in Afghanistan. It is found within several Provinces of Afghanistan, in Baghlan Province, Balkh Province and Zabul Province. ===Habitat=== It grows on alpine meadows, screes, grassy and sandy slopes. They can be found at an altitude of above sea level. ==Cultivation== It is hardy to European Zone H4, in most other areas, it can be grown in an alpine house or bulb frame. It prefers to grow in well-drained soils, in sunny situations. It is rarely found in nurseries. ==ReferencesOther sources=== * Mathew, B. 1981. The Iris. 62. * Rechinger, K. H., ed. 1963–.

The Declaration was adopted as a rule of engagement of the White troops. Among other things, it directed the troops about the treatment of prisoners, and gave commanders of units wide powers to carry out executions at their sole discretion. Already its inception, its legality was highly questionable, because a death sentence for treason was not legal unless a state of war was declared. The senate (the government of the Whites) did not want to do this, because the only applicable law would have been the hated Czarist Russian martial law, which would also transfer powers to the army. They preferred to consider the Reds as \\"armed civilians\\". The army favored a declaration of war, in order to treat the prisoners as civilians, wherein execution for treason would become legal. A compromise was reached: the motivation was that an extrajudicial execution of a \\"saboteur caught red-handed\\" or \\"quarter at discretion\\" was a justifiable homicide committed in defense of life or property. In practice, battlefield commanders decided which Red prisoners would be released, detained or considered dangerous and summarily executed. For example, known \\"murderers\\" or \\"arsonists\\" were shot at the sole discretion of the commander. Due to this policy, it can be difficult to distinguish whether deaths \\"in battle\\" actually occurred in combat or as summary executions after the fact. The mass execution known as \\"lottery of Huruslahti\\", an alleged decimation, was the defining moment. After this event, summary executions became common. Military tribunals were initially established, but generally interrogators could freely decide on the fate of the prisoners. On 25 February 1918, Mannerheim promulgated a decree to dismiss these tribunals. However, this had little effect because the battlefield commanders exercised their discretion largely independently far into the spring. Summary executions continued throughout 1918 even after the conclusion of the war, particularly in prison camps. As Russian troops fought on the Red side, the Whites assumed that any Russians captured would be hostile and stoked ethnic hatred. Thus, any sort of Russians captured along with the Reds, civilian or military, were typically summarily executed. This included for example 200 Russian civilians in the aftermath of the Battle of Viipuri and even one White officer of Polish origin in the Battle of Tampere. Regardless of its legality, the legality and possible guilt became a moot point after amnesty laws were passed after the war. == References  External links == * Shoot on the Spot Declaration Category:Finnish Civil War Category:February 1918 events Category:1918 documents ","title":"Shoot on the Spot Declaration"},{"id":"46835707","text":"Irvine Byrd \\"Irv\\" Hill was a Virginia politician and broadcasting executive who served as the Mayor of the city of Norfolk from 1974 to 1976. ==Early life== Hill was born in Norfolk to Madeline C.

He also played for Richmond, Port Melbourne, and Footscray in the Victorian Football Association (VFA). ==Personal life== The son of William Brennan, and Mary Brennan, née O'Farrell, Arthur Brennan was born in Abbotsford, Victoria on 2 March 1881. He came from a large family; William and Mary had eight daughters and three sons. Both of his brothers played football, most notably Owen Brennan, who was the first member of the family to play in the VFL, with 11 appearances for Collingwood in 1900. His other brother, William Jr, played in the VFA for Northcote and Port Melbourne. ==Football career== Brennan played his only senior game for St Kilda during the 1901 VFL season, as a 20-year-old. In round 15, Brennan was a member of the St Kilda team which lost to Fitzroy at Junction Oval by 72 points. Although his VFL career was brief, Brennan played for a number of years in the VFA. He was regarded as being one of Richmond's finest players in their pre- VFL era, a club he played for from 1903 to 1905. In 1906 and 1907, Brennan played with his brother William at Port Melbourne, then midway through the 1908 VFA season he crossed to Footscray. The Herald, Melbourne, 30 September 1914.Bigamy Charged: Fitzroy Case Remanded,The Herald, (Wednesday, 30 September 1914), p.1. ==Bigamy trial== Arrested on 29 September 1914, Brennan was committed for trial on 7 October 1914, on a charge of having committed bigamy. At his trial, evidence was given that the Rev. Henry Heathershaw (1833-1907) had married Arthur Brennan to his first wife, Catherine Prout, on 7 May 1902, and that Brennan had left her after two years. Further evidence was given by Alice Mary Patton, who appeared in court having been brought from Pentridge Women's Prison Gaol in order to do so,Bigamous Brennan, The (Melbourne) Truth, (Saturday, 17 October 1914), p.6. that, while Brennan was still married to Catherine (and while Catherine was still alive), the Rev.

In August 1918, whilst still in England, he was charged with being absent without leave and was imprisoned, without pay for 28 days. In September 1918, soon after arriving in France, he was imprisoned for three days without pay for \\"conduct to the prejudice of good order and military discipline in that he discharged firearms in his hut on 23.9.18\\"; and in October 1918, he was imprisoned, again, for being absent without leave. He was absent without leave, once more, from 26 October 1918 until he was arrested on 18 November 1918. ===Court-martial=== Brennan and a fellow soldier, Private Patrick McGrath (51412),World War One Service Record: Private Patrick McGrath (51412), National Archives of Australia. were arrested in November 1918, and put on trial, in France, after they had forcibly entered an estaminet in Saint-Vaast, on the night of 29 October 1918.Lambley (2012), pp.86 (Brennan), 223 (McGrath). Both were found guilty of \\"committing an offence against the property of an inhabitant of the country in which he was serving\\", and both were sentenced to two years imprisonment with hard labour; a sentence which Brennan served, at the Northampton Military Prison, in England. His sentence was suspended, and he was released from prison on 18 June 1919, under the powers provided by the \\"Suspension of Sentences\\" provisions (i.e., Regulations 643A and 643B) of the Australian Military Regulations under the Defence Act 1903-1915 that had come into operation on 7 March 1917,Notification of the Making of Regulations, No.38, Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, (Thursday, 8 March 1917), p.418.Statutory Rules 1917, No.62, Federal Register of Legislation, Australian Government. and was returned to his regiment and, then, was repatriated (with his regiment) to Australia in the HMAT Port Melbourne A16,WWI troopship A16: HMT SS Star of Victoria / HMAT Port Melbourne, Australian National Maritime Museum. leaving England on 5 July 1919, and landing in Melbourne on 20 August 1919.\\"On S.S. Port Melbourne (Left England July 5)\\", The Argus, (Thursday, 7 August 1919), p.8; Troops Returning, The Argus, (Wednesday, 20 August 1919), p.10. ==Murder== The Brennan household, which consisted of Arthur and five of his sisters, had an arrangement with their immediate neighbour, Norah Power, that, if she was alone and in need of assistance, she would knock on the wall which divided their homes. ===12 September 1931=== On 12 September 1931, Brennan was shot dead outside his home, at 26 Rowe Street, North Fitzroy,Deaths: Brennan, The Argus, (Monday, 14 September 1931), p.1.Scene of North Fitzroy Fatal Shooting, The Herald, (Monday, 14 September 1931), p.5. by a burglar, who was trying to get into Power's residence. That night, Power had been alarmed by the sound of someone trying to get through her window. Brennan was in his kitchen and, once he heard Power's signal, walked across his garden to her home. He confronted a man he saw standing on Power's verandah who attempted unsuccessfully to defuse the situation by claiming he was at the home to visit a friend. When he tried to make his escape, Brennan blocked his path at the garden gate and the pair then grappled. During the struggle, Brennan was shot in the chest by a small automatic pistol that the intruder had managed to draw from his overcoat with a free arm. Brennan died there on the footpath within minutes. The gunman was chased by two other bystanders but was able to get away. ===Search for suspect=== An investigation revealed that the gunman, likely aged 25 to 30, had earlier been seen scoping the area and were, therefore, able to get a good description of his appearance. The police were unable to locate the suspect; and, after three months had elapsed, the City Coroner gave a finding that Brennan had been murdered by a \\"person unknown\\". ==Alleged perpetrators== Although the case remains unsolved today, the Victorian police sequentially identified (albeit posthumously) two known criminals as Brennan's murderer, first, at the time of his death, John Gepp, then, later, when that allegation had been retracted, Reginald James Barker, although no evidence supporting either of these official allegations was ever presented in court. ===John Gepp, alias John Vernon Pinkus, alias Raymond Brennan, alias John D'Arcy=== Major General Thomas Blamey, Chief Commissioner of the Victorian Police Force John Gepp (1898-1932), alias John Vernon Pinkus, alias Raymond Brennan, alias John D'Arcy was shot dead on 18 January, when escaping from the police who had attempted to apprehend him outside his Clifton Hill residence (apparently in order to arrest him for Brennan's murder). In his attempt to evade arrest, he fled the scene, and was badly injured when attempting to clear an iron spiked fence at the Jolimont railway station; and, bleeding profusely, he then ran into an adjacent park, \\"turned in his tracks and fired a shot at his pursuers\\". The police returned fire (\\"The staff at the Jolimont station heard the report of a shot and then a fusillade\\") killing Gepp.A Jolimont Sensation, The Age, (Tuesday, 19 January 1932), p.7; Shooting of Criminal: Finding: \\"Wound Lawfully Inflicted\\", The Weekly Times, (Saturday, 13 February 1932), p.24; John Gepp, known as Raymond Brennan, buried under the name of Vernon Pinkus, The Herald, (Thursday, 21 January 1932), p.6. At the time of his death, police stated that \\"[they were] now certain from information which has come to hand that [Gepp] was the prowler who on September 12 last murdered Arthur Brennan in front of his home in Howe Street, North Fitzroy\\".Yarra Park Duel, Victim Known: \\"Desperate Gunman\\": Police Sure He Killed Arthur Brennan, The Herald, (Tuesday, 19 January 1932), p.5. However, in April 1932, once forensic evidence had revealed that Gepp's gun had not fired the bullet that killed Brennan, the police had become convinced \\"beyond all reasonable doubt that [Gepp] was not the murderer of Arthur Brennan\\".An Unsolved Murder: The Shooting of Arthur Brennan: Police Offer a Startling Theory, The Age, (Saturday, 16 April 1932), p.15. On 15 April 1932, Thomas Blamey, the Chief Commissioner of the Victorian Police Force, formally announced that Gepp was no longer considered to be Brennan's murderer. ===Reginald James Barker=== Reginald James Barker (1914-1932) was shot dead on 27 February 1932 while attempting to escape from Pentridge Prison in the company of two other prisoners (who, although not shot, also failed to escape). Having stolen a warder's rifle, he wounded two of the prison's warders in the process.Convict Shot Dead, The Argus, (Monday, 29 February 1932) p.9. Although just 17½, he was more than 6 foot tall, and was strongly built; and \\"despite his youth, [he] was described by police [at the time of his death] as being one of the most desperate young criminals who had passed through their hands in recent years\\"Gaol Sensation, The (Perth) Mirror, (Saturday, 27 February 1932, p.3. Having previously been convicted of a number of crimes (including firearms offences, and breaking and entering), for which he had (already) served several long terms in detention centres, he was in prison awaiting sentencing, having been found guilty of (a) shooting at a police constable with the intent to murder him,Shooting at Constable, 'The Age, (Saturday, 30 January 1932), p.12; Gaol Sentences, The Herald', (Friday, 26 February 1932), p.5. and (b) stealing a motorcycle and sidecar.Cycle Thief Pleads Guilty, The Herald, (Wednesday, 3 February 1932), p.17. On Friday 15 April 1932, in the process declaring that Gepp was no longer considered to be Brennan's murderer, Police Commissioner Blamey also announced that, \\"as a result of investigations by detectives it had been clearly established that the murderer of Arthur Brennan in Fitzroy on September 12, 1931, was Reginald James Barker\\". ::The police base their theory that Barker shot Brennan largely on the fact that experts have decided that the bullet which was extracted from Brennan's chest by the Government pathologist (Dr. C.H. Mollison)Birrell, John, \\"Mollison, Crawford Henry (Mollie) (1863–1949)\\", in B,. Nairn (ed.), Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 10: 1891-1939: Lat - Ner, (MUP), 1986. was fired from a .25 automatic Colt pistol, which was found in Barker's possession and which was identified as having been stolen from Donald Mackintosh's gunshop in Bourke street some time previously. While inquiring into Barker's death detectives were told by other prisoners serving sentences at [Pentridge] gaol that Barker was the man who shot Brennan. [\\"It was while the police were making inquiries into [Barker's] death that they were given information which led to their report implicating Barker. The police report was based on the statements of several of Barker's fellow- prisoners, who allegedly told the detectives that Barker had admitted the murder, and was worried because he thought the police would have a revolver, which had been found in his possession earlier, examined, and, by comparison with the bullet taken from Brennan's head, learn that he was the murderer. He also feared, the prisoners are alleged to have said, that the police would find his overcoat at home, and have it identified by Miss Power.\\"Brennan Murder: Mrs Barker Says Son Guiltless: Hospital Report Produced,The Herald, (Monday, 18 April 1932), p.4.] [The prisoners] said that they thought that Barker was under the impression that a large sum of money was kept in the house occupied by Miss Power, in Rowe street, North Fitzroy, next door to Mr. Brennan's house, and that he thought that Mr Brennan was a policeman. When Miss Power was shown Barker's photograph recently it is said that she exclaimed \\"That is the man who shot Mr. Brennan. I knew that the man the police shot at Jolimont was not the murderer of Mr. Brennan.\\" At the conclusion of a report made by members of the criminal investigation branch it is stated:- \\"After making inquiries into this matter we have no hesitation in stating that Barker was the man who shot Arthur Brennan.\\" The Argus, 16 April 1932. Prompted by Blamey's emphatic declaration, Barker's mother visited the office of The Herald on the following Monday (18 April 1932), and produced documentary evidence, in the form of a medical report from Dr. Edward James Grieve,Edward James Grieve, MBBS, MRCS, FRCS (1904-1975), The Royal College of Surgeons of England the Medical Superintendent of St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne — the veracity of the report's contents were (subsequently) confirmed directly with Dr. Grieve by The Herald. — to the effect that, on his first of seven visits to the hospital (10 September 1931), Barker was extremely lame and was given crutches (Grieve told the reporter that the injury was so severe that \\"he was surprised that Barker had been able to reach the hospital unassisted. 'It was a wonder that he could walk at all', said Dr. Grieve.\\") An X-ray taken on 11 September 1931 showed a fracture, that was some weeks old, of both bones of his right ankle; and on 14 September his leg was put in plaster of Paris. Mrs Barker told The Herald that she had specifically told the detectives, at the time of the coroner's inquest, of her son's injured foot, and that, following that, they could have checked her story with the doctor before coming to their final conclusion. His mother declared that, at 17 years of age, 6 foot tall, and well-built, her son was significantly different from the \\"official description of Brennan's murderer [that witnesses had] given police ... between 25 and 30 years old, 5ft.9in. in height, and of thin to medium build\\"; and, moreover, that, \\"apart from the difference in description, ... her son, from the hospital report, obviously could not have been the prowler who frightened Miss Norah Power, who lived next door to Brennan, on September 12; and he could not possibly have run away after having shot Brennan, as witnesses said Brennan's murderer had done\\". Mrs. Barker further declared that the police claim that they had traced Brennan's murder weapon to Barker's home was false: \\"She said that the detectives who visited her home after her son's death had taken only a grey overcoat — the overcoat which, according to the police, Miss Power later identified. She [viz., Mrs. Barker] had never seen a revolver in the house\\". In explaining why she had come to The Herald, \\"with a medical report which, she claimed, showed that her son could not have been guilty of the murder of Arthur Brennan, 48, as alleged by the police\\" — \\"'In their endeavor to clear Pinkus', said Mrs Barker, 'the police have put the blame for n terrible crime on my boy, who, whatever else he might have done, was not a murderer. The detectives were told, outside the Morgue at the inquest, about my son's foot injury, and they could have seen the doctors before having made [the report that they submitted to the Police Commissioner]'\\" — \\"Mrs. Barker said that she had sought [earlier] today to place [Grieve's] report before the Police Commissioner (General Blamey) but that he had refused an interview\\". ==See also== *List of unsolved murders ==FootnotesReferencesMilitary sources=== *First World War Embarkation Roll: Private Arthur Brennan (51513), Australian War Memorial: mistakenly has his date of enlistment as 3 September 1916, rather than 3 September 1915. * First World War Nominal Roll: Private Arthur Brennan (51513), Australian War Memorial. *World War One Service Record: Private Arthur Brennan (51513), National Archives of Australia. ===Other sources=== * Alexander, Radu, \\"Top 10 Forgotten Murders of Once- Famous Athletes\\", listverse.com, 29 April 2017. * * Lambley, Desmond Bruce, March in the Guilty Bastard, Zeus Publications, (Burleigh, Qld), 2012. * * Port Melbourne Football Club Player List (1886-2017), portmelbournefc.com.au. ==External links== * * * Arthur \\"Snowy\\" Brennan, The VFA Project.

Paul Grandhomme was a French medalist, engraver and enameller. Born in Paris in 1851, he died in Saint-Briac-sur-Mer in 1944. == Life == He was originally trained as a jeweller, but the 1871 Franco-Prussian war forced him to become a librarian. This proved to be the start of his enamelling career as, after reading Claudius Popelin’s history of enamelling, Grandhomme became fascinated by the technique. After studying with Auguste Mollard, an enameller who was experienced in the chemistry of enamelling, and Jules-Clément Chaplain, he worked with Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and Jules-Élie Delaunay, and was influenced by his friend and fellow artist, Raphaël Collin. In 1874 he presented work at the Salon of French Artists (Salon des artistes français), an enamel portrait of Vittoria Colonna. In 1877 he began to collaborate with his pupil Alfred Jean Garnier, and together they presented further work at the Salon des artistes français, including a Virgin in the style of Carlo Crivelli, and a portrait of Edward VII. Together they won the gold medal at the 1889 Universal Exhibition in Paris. They were also the last enamellers to collaborate with Gustave Moreau. Another frequent collaborator of Grandhomme's was Jules Brateau, a silversmith and metal-worker. Grandhomme used his flat as his studio, with his dining room as the main area of work, and using a furnace in his kitchen to bake the enamel. Grandhomme also worked with the Falize Jewellery house, particularly Lucien Falize.Le Corbeiller, Clare. “A Dynasty of Jewelers by Katherine Purcell.” [Review] Studies in the Decorative Arts, vol. 9, no. 1, 2001, pp. 159–162. . He is buried in Saint-Briac-sur-Mer. His tomb is topped by a bronze statue created by Émile Armel-Beaufils and his wife. == Works == Grandhomme worked mainly in the Limoges School Revival style. A variety of Grandhomme's work is displayed at the Musée d'Orsay, including a series of enamelled tableaux on Greek mythological themes that he created with Garnier in the style of Gustave Moreau. Two of his enamelled medals are on show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A pre-World War I commemorative medal he made was part of a Victoria and Albert Museum exhibition on 'European Commemorative Medals for the Great War'. ==References== Category:1944 deaths Category:1851 births Category:French medallists Category:20th-century French sculptors Category:19th-century French sculptors Category:French male sculptors ","title":"Paul Grandhomme"},{"id":"46835919","text":"Pat Moran (born 1934 in Enid, Oklahoma) is an American jazz pianist. ==Life and work== Born Helen Mudgett, Pat Moran studied piano at Phillips University and later at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music. She began her career as a concert pianist but eventually moved on to jazz. She founded the Pat Moran Quartet, which later became the Pat Moran Trio, and played New York's Hickory House, the Birdland and the Blue Note concerts in Chicago. In subsequent iterations of her band, Moran performed with singer Beverly Kelly, bassist John Doling, and drummer John Whited. In the mid-1950s, she released two albums for Bethlehem Records. In April 1957, Moran's quartet performed at Birdland, accompanied by a brass section, with arrangements by Nat Pierce. Moran later released two more albums for the Audio Fidelity label: Beverly Kelly Sings with the Pat Moran Trio and the Trio album This Is Pat Moran with Scott LaFaro on bass and Gene Gammage on drums. She also performed with Mel Tormé, Oscar Pettiford, and the Terry Gibbs Dream Band from 1959 through 1961. McCoy was featured in a book by Ray Avery (photographer) called Stars of Jazz (1998). In the early 1980s, Moran released an album of children's songs, Shakin' Loose with Mother Goose, in collaboration with Steve Allen and Jayne Meadows. The album's companion book was awarded the American Book Award.

The book explores the moral dilemmas of a former member of the Birkenau Sonderkommando, Ovadya ben Malka. The book was reissued in 2015 with a new Foreword by Rabbi Nathan Lopes Cardozo. ==Plot summary== The book opens with Yael reaching out to a rabbi for a rabbinic judgement for “Alex”. In subsequent correspondence with the rabbi, Rav Ish-Shalom, we learn that Alex's real name is Ovadya. He was deported to Birkenau from his home in Salonika, Greece at the age of 17. His mother and sister were gassed on arrival and Ovadya was sent to the Sonderkommando, the group of prisoners responsible for running the machinery of murder. Ovadya wants the rabbi to serve as a rabbinic judge—essentially to put himself on trial for what he did in Birkenau. “The fact that good people can be forced to do wrong doesn’t make them less good,” he says. “But it also doesn’t make the wrong less wrong.” However, he is unable to speak of what he did to survive, and his past is gradually revealed in a series of letters to the rabbi and to Masha, a woman who was forced into prostitution during the war. He is able to tell her what he cannot speak aloud. Yael, born two decades later in America, has no connection with Ovadya, and yet she haunted by a mysterious memory of something she could not have lived. In an attempt to understand the source of these memories, she sets out on a quest to Europe and eventually Israel. Her quest to learn what and how she remembers is bound up with Ovadya’s search for forgiveness and atonement. She too is unable to speak of the harrowing glimpses revealed by memory, but Ovadya holds the key to fitting the pieces together. The second half of the book follows Ovadya in his spiritual quest, under the guidance of Rav Ish- Shalom. The rabbi sets him the task of bearing witness for those who perished in the gas chambers, but, scarred by the memory, Ovadya is reluctant to tell what he saw. Little by little, his memory returns, and he finds that he had suppressed even the good memories of his childhood in Salonika. Eventually, a breakthrough occurs and he is able to do what is required by Jewish Law—to journey back to Birkenau and make a formal confession to the souls of those he feels that he has wronged. == Backstory == On July 7, 2010, B'Sod Siach an online Hebrew-language newsletter,http://www.shoresh.org.il/usersfiles/articlesdocs/%D7%91%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%93%20%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%97-%20%D7%9E%D7%98%D7%95%D7%AA%20%D7%9E%D7%A1%D7%A2%D7%99.PDF carried a write-up of a viddui—a ritual confession—from beyond the grave. A group of twenty young graduates from a teachers’ college in England had served as witnesses to the last will and testament of Ovadya ben Malka—one of the prisoners forced to operate the machinery of death. This episode, as told from the author's point of view, forms a key chapter of A Damaged Mirror. ==ReferencesExternal links== *\\"Peering into A Damaged Mirror: A trauma therapist explains the psychological impact of the dilemmas faced by the Sonderkommando\\".

She is known for presenting her designs in creative ways, including in the form of a murder mystery, as a \\"sock hop,\\" and in a dollhouse. In 2015, director and actress Lena Dunham promoted Antonoff's collaboration with & Other Stories in a short film called Vote Audrey. Dunham famously wore Antonoff's Uterus Sweater to a Planned Parenthood event where she then auctioned it off to raise an additional $4,000 for the cause. The text of her popular 2013 \\"I'm With Her\\" sweatshirt transcended into politics after Hillary Clinton's campaign adopted I'm With Her as the campaign's slogan. Antonoff starred in and was the creative director for the music video for Tegan and Sara's \\"Boyfriend\\" in 2016. == Early Life and Interest == Antonoff was raised in New Jersey where she and her brother Jack Antonoff, singer and songwriter of Bleachers and lead guitarist of the indie rock band Fun, would commute to the Upper West Side to attend the Professional Children's School where Rachel studied theater. Her younger sister, Sarah, died of brain cancer at the age of 13. Growing up Antonoff and her brother, Jack, became very involved in the Punk Rock and hardcore music scene in the 1990s. When Jack Antonoff went on tour with his band around the country, Rachel tagged along. Later Rachel Antonoff attributed this experience with influencing the way in which she creates. During her twenties, Rachel attended Fordham University and briefly worked as a freelance writer after graduation. During the same time, Rachel loved clothing and frequently discussed designing clothes with her roommate at the time. When Antonoff was 22, her-then roommate and best friend began their fashion business, Mooka Kinney. The two took three designs and some fabric to their childhood neighbor and seamstress in New Jersey who then sewed six samples in her basement. The first dress ever made was called the \\"Swan Dress,\\" made out of a green printed fabric with swans found at Mood, a well known fabric store in New York City. The dress was a sleeveless baby doll mini dress. From there, the two got some friends to model their designs and sent the photos to previous contacts Antonoff had from working in PR. The only response the pair received was from Teen Vogue who scheduled a meeting to meet Antonoff and her partner and to see the samples. After the meeting the contact wrote a story about the two and made a call to the then-buyer at Barneys New York. After the phone call the buyer at Barney's placed an order for 300 units. Later down the road the young business relationship fell apart and Rachel Antonoff started her own brand. == Career == Antonoff founded her brand, Rachel Antonoff, in 2008, immediately after her separation from her friend and business partner. The brand's first season was Spring 2009. Rachel often includes sweatshirts in her line, because she personally favors comfortable clothing. Her line also includes a majority of dresses as she finds it easier to look put together when you do not have to figure out what goes together. The brand as a whole draws from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s for inspiration for prints and silhouettes. Antonoff also incorporates political themes and messages into her designs. In 2013 Rachel Antonoff designed a t-shirt with a line drawing of a uterus that became known as the reproductive tee that has remained a popular item since. The shirt was famously worn by actress and friend Lena Dunham. Since then the brand has designed shirts that have included the words \\"Hysterical Female\\" and \\"I'm With Her.\\" Most of the prints for each collection are painted in-house. Rachel Antonoff's clothes have been worn by notable celebrities such as Lena Dunham, Zooey Deschanel, and Diane Guerrero. To present her collections Antonoff is known for frequently making videos rather than conducting a live fashion show. The idea originally came from friend Lena Dunham as a way to save money, but has continued as a creative project that better captures the brand. Antonoff is known to create stories and characters for these videos and includes unique models of all sizes, her mother, grandmother, and friends. She also frequently collaborates with brother Jack Antonoff on musical choices. For instance, Antonoff debuted her Fall 2016 collection by staging a complete Broadway musical performance. The performance included a cast of dancers from the show How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (musical) that danced to the song \\"A Secretary is Not a Toy. The performance also includes live vocals from singer Ali Stroker and Jack Antonoff played the role of male secretary. The cast of dancers, soloist, and brother wore clothes from the collection. == Activism == Antonoff and members of the band Fun formed The Ally Coalition, or TAC, to encourage those in the fashion and entertainment industries to use their influence to end discrimination against LGBTQ people. She has long been fighting for LGBTQ equality and donates a percentage of the proceeds from her collections to support organizations that share the same goals. Antonoff also offered her support to a number of other organizations including GLAAD, Human Rights Campaign, The Trevor Project, and Freedom To Marry. ==ReferencesExternal links== *The Ally Coalition, official site *Rachel Antonoff, official site *\\"Rachel Antonoff Fall 2015 Ready-to-Wear\\", style.com *\\"Sibling Success: The Power of 2\\", nytimes.com Category:Living people Category:LGBT rights activists from the United States Category:People from Teaneck, New Jersey Category:1981 births ","title":"Rachel Antonoff"},{"id":"46835999","text":"Sopranino refers to a singing voice that is higher than soprano.

Heating films can be directly installed to provide underfloor heating, wall radiant heating and ceiling radiant heating. The films can also be used in heating panels to produce wall or ceiling panel heaters. Although heating films do not usually run at very high temperatures (typically on floors and up to on walls), due to the large surface area they cover, they can provide significant energy output. Also due to the low temperature, undesirable heat losses can be lower, when compared to higher temperature wet heating systems with losses from long pipe runs from the central heating source. ==Description== Electric resistance heating films consist of a substrate film, most commonly made from plastic, printed or coated with a resistance material and electric contact busbars. This is laminated or coated with another layer of insulating film, usually similar to the substrate. Electrical contacts can be made using various types of crimp contacts, which make contact through the covering films to the internal busbars. If the operating voltage is high enough, the contacts must be additionally insulated and additional safety insulation or safety earth covering must be provided over the film to protect users from shock, in case of damage to the installed film. Heating films can be used as a replacement for conventional heating systems, as a primary heat source or used to augment existing systems. Due to the simplicity of installation and ease of hiding the installation, it can be popular with DIY installers. The films can be placed or removed when needed, when installed under carpets of other easily removable floor covering. Heating controllers can allow the residents to select which surface will be heated. Films are available with different power outputs per m2. The required power output will depend on the area covered, building insulation, required energy input to the room and maximum desired surface temperature. Many countries have regulations for the maximum floor or wall temperature. Thermostats with surface temperature sensors may be required in these jurisdictions. This heating system is mainly used in Asian countries like Korea, where it is considered as a modern version of ondol heating.Ondol heating – Heating film  Heating Cable  ThermostatsHow do I use my heating?  whatawaygookTraditional Korean Heating System Some heating films are semi- permanent, meaning that they need to be changed after a certain period of use, and are not widely available everywhere. However, many modern heating films can be considered permanent, lasting at least 20 years with no degradation in performance. Heating films are becoming increasingly popular globallyhttps://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/global-infrared-heating- films-market-to-witness-a-cagr-of-1076-during-2018-2024-2019-03-05 A heating film roll ==Ondol radiant floor heating== An ondol, also called gudeul (Korean: 구들), in Korean traditional architecture, is underfloor heating which uses direct heat transfer from wood smoke to the underside of a thick masonry floor. Many modern Korean houses use a radiant underfloor heating system that's called ondol, referring to the traditional ondol heating system. In fact, Korean people refer to any domestic heating system as ondol. Technically, the modern day ondol is based on the same concept as the underfloor radiant heating invented by the American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who was interested in Japanese architecture. Wright came with the idea while visiting a Japanese nobleman's house, where he found a tea room that was different from the rest of the house, using a Korean ondol as a heating system. He then took the same idea to create a heating system that fits American houses. Wright invented modern radiant floor heating, using hot water running through pipes instead of hot air through flues.Radiant floor heating systems by Elektra and Ideal-Heating.com : ARTICLE 'The flow of ideas: From the West to the East and from the East to the West.' A heating film, itself, is a variation of the modern ondol, but it doesn't require hot water and pipes as it is fully electric. There are also many variations of this underfloor heating system, as many underfloor heaters are based on PTC heating element, far-infrared rays, carbon film, or cables, etc. ==Operating voltage== Heating films for domestic heating are available to be powered directly from the mains electricity supply in different countries, e.g. 120 volts AC, 220 volts AC, etc. or low voltage, e.g. 24 volts. ===Mains voltage=== In general, due to safety issues, heating films supplied directly from the mains are only installed underfloor or in ceilings. Due to potentially hazardous voltages from mains electricity, protection from electric shock is usually required, either due to damage (e.g. nails) or water ingress. Most commonly, additional insulation layers are added over the heating film and sealed with waterproof tapes, although this does not provide protection from shock due to damage like nails. Metalised bags or sheets, connected to earth can also used, relying on earth leakage (RCD) protection devices on the mains supply to provide protection from shock due to damage. Due to the additional protection layers, the heating efficiency of mains films can be reduced, however the lack of power supply makes these types of heating film attractive. ===Low voltage=== Low voltage heating films are usually designed to function at voltages within SELV range and therefore present no danger of shock. Operation at such voltages means that the films have many fewer limitations on where and how they can be installed, however higher currents are required for operation, requiring thicker wires and voltage converting isolation transformers or power supplies to run from the local mains. Alternatively, low voltage heating films may be suitable for off grid installations where battery, solar, wind or other power is available at the required voltage and current. Low voltage heating films can be particularly suitable for use in wet areas, where water ingress is a possibility. Low voltage heating films are also suitable for installation on walls to provide radiant heating. These films can include surface finishes designed to take plaster coatings directly onto the installed film. Due to the low voltage, they are completely electric shock safe when damaged due to nails, screws or when other fittings are put directly through the film. Breaks in the resistive film will affect the power output and metal bridges could cause excessive localised heating due to increased current flow and should not be made across breaks in the film. Breaks in the busbars would also cause functional issues. It is also possible to install low voltage heating films connected directly to the mains, by connecting sufficient of the sheets in series. However, in this case, similar insulation and shock protection would be required as for mains film installations. Heating films installed in walls and ceilings, provide heating predominantly using infrared or far infrared radiation, directly to the occupants of a room. Underfloor heating can also provides radiant heat, but floor coverings must be selected to provide infrared transmission and heat conduction. == Greenhouse gas emissions of heating film == The greenhouse gas emissions of heating film is split between manufacture, shipping, installation and operational emissions. === Manufacture === Due to variations between the construction of heating films from different manufacturers, calculations for greenhouse gas emissions to manufacture the products should be made for each manufacturer's film. Most heating films use plastic films, typically PET. These films can be produced from various sources, including recycling, which should be taken into account. Even where the plastic is recycled or derived from renewable sources, energy will be required to produce it and this must be accounted for. The resistance layer can be made in many different ways. Typically it is carbon based, with various other chemicals to make it adhere to the substrate sheet. All of these components must be accounted for when considering manufacturing emissions. The copper busbars, although small, will be a source of emissions. The copper may be printed as particles, which will require suitable chemicals to provide adhesion or stuck on as a ribbon, which will also require suitable adhesive chemicals. Silver particles may also be used to provide additional conductivity between the copper and resistance layer. === Shipping === Heating films are lightweight, typically 200 to . Greenhouse gas emissions due to shipping will depend on distance travelled and transport method. Assuming the heating film travels a similar distance to other heating systems from manufacturer to installation, due to its comparatively low weight, emissions to ship heating film will be comparatively lower. === Installation === Installation of heating films will consume almost no energy when installed underfloor. Where adhesives are used for installation, e.g. on walls and ceilings, the emissions involved in manufacturing and shipping the adhesive must also be included. Some adhesives can produce environmentally damaging emissions as they cure. Low emission adhesives should be used or these emissions must be taken into account when considering installation emissions. Wiring could also add emissions, where cable runs through walls and floors need to be provided. === Operating emissions === Since heating films are powered by electricity, no direct emissions will occur at the installation. The operating emissions will depend entirely on the electricity source and emissions will occur wherever the electricity is generated. E.g. where the heating film is supplied directly by nuclear, wind or solar energy, the greenhouse gas emissions will be zero. Where the electricity is supplied by mains electricity in a region where the electricity is produced from coal, the overall operating greenhouse gas emission will be high. However, most countries are aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for electricity generation. In countries where these policies are in place, heating film supplied from the mains can be considered to produce lower greenhouse gas emissions than coal, oil or gas heating systems and this will tend to improve over time. ==Transparent heating film== Transparent heating films are a variant of the basic heating films but are built according to a different architecture. It consists of a thin and flexible polymer film with a conductive optical coating. These heating films can be used in museums as a replacement for heating tables http://www.imatproject.eu/en/pld/conductive- transparent-film-heater-as-alternative-to-heating-table-towards-new- intelligent-mobile-accurate-thermo-electrical-imat-device-for-structural- conservation-of-paintings/23 ==References External links == *https://ecofloorheating.com *https://www.ebay.com/sch/ecofloorheating/m.html?_nkw=&_armrs=1&_ipg=&_from= * http://www.heatingfilm.net/ * http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/products/categories/heating/13740 * http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-carbon-tape-heated-vest-modular-system/ Category:Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning Category:Residential heating ","title":"Heating film"},{"id":"46836073","text":"Claudia is a Polish language monthly women's magazine published in Warsaw, Poland. ==History and profile== Claudia was established in 1993.

His interest in the theater began in childhood in a small community then outside of Mexico City proper. Although he acted some small parts in movies, he theater career began while doing formal theater training, first in Mexico then in France. He worked to promote theater in Mexico, which did not experience the kind of governmental support that the other arts did after the Mexican Revolution, performing in and directing a wide variety of plays, as well as directing theaters and even the theatrical division of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (National Institute of Fine Arts). He received recognition for both acting and directing early in his career, but major awards such as Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes (National Prize for Arts and Sciences) in the 2000s. ==Background== José Solé (full name José Solé Nájera) was born to María Magdalena Nájera and José Solé, a Spanish refugee of an upper-class family, in a community called Mixcoac. At that time, Mixcoac was separate from Mexico City, a small town with farms, stone paved streets and an economy based on providing produce to the nearby capital. His introduction to theater came through a street performance in the small town, Solé was restless and the activity impressed him, deciding early to go into show business despite his family's lack of connections with this world. When he was seven his father gave him a set for a puppet theater, which he loved enough that his parents decided to take it from him as punishment during vacations after he failed classes at school. His early experience in acting came from forming a theater group in middle school and when he was older, taking on small character parts in movies. He then went on to study formally, first at the School of Theater Arts (Escuela de Arte Teatral) of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (INBA) . In 1956 he traveled to Paris to study scene direction with Rene Dupoy on scholarship from the French government. He also studied set design at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\". His career in theater began in 1946 and continued uninterrupted until he announced his retirement in 2010. In the 1990s he had a laryngectomy, requiring the use of an electrolarynx. ==Career== Solé had a theatrical career that spanned over six decades, starting as an actor then expanding into stage direction, set and costume design, as well as directing theaters and cultural institutions. His theatrical acting career began in 1946, as part of the Teatro Estudiantil Autónomo (Autonomous Student Theater), becoming a member of the INBA Theater Company in 1948. Studying at National Autonomous University of Mexico, he joined the Compañía de Teatro Universitario in 1950, with did several tours around Mexico. He made his debut as a director in the early 1960s, with the play Amadeo by Eugene Ionesco, During the same decade, he became the director of the Xola Theater (today the Julio Prieto Theater) from 1965 to 1968. In the 1970s, Solé became the director of the director of the INBA Theatrical Department (1977-1987/1991-1994), including the school he studied acting at. Solé founded cultural institutions such as Mexico's National Theater Company (Compañía Nacional de Teatro) and the Rodolfo Usigli National Center of Theater Research, Documentation and Information, along with the Muestra Nacional de Teatro (National Theater Show) in the 1970s. He also served as a cultural attaché of the Mexican embassy in the Soviet Union from 1975 to 1977. Solé's career got its start at a time when Mexico's theater was in crisis. Despite government funding for a number of arts after the Mexican Revolution, theater was not included, and split into those which performed foreign works commercially and those who tried to perform more nationalistic works without government support. Solé does not believe in dividing theater into types such as experimental or commercial, forming and directing theater groups that performed all styles of works. He, himself, has directed most genres of theatre including children's, musical comedy, commercial productions, experimental, opera and even some television, and include \\"Moctezuma II\\", by Sergio Magaña; \\"La casa de Bernarda Alba\\", by Federico García Lorca; \\"La Orestiada\\", by Esquilo; \\"Las Troyanas\\", by Eurípides; \\"El avaro\\", by Molière, \\"El alcalde de Zalamea\\", by Calderón de la Barca; \\"Otelo\\" and \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\", by William Shakespeare. ==Recognition== Six years after his debut in theater, Solé received the 1952 Mexican Theater Critics Association Prize for best young actor. The same organization recognized him as best actor in 1954. His acting debut earned him a Best Direction award from the Mexican Theater Critics Association. The prize for Best Produccion of the Mexican Theater Critics Association now bear his name. Solé's first major recognition for his life's work was in 1997, at the National Theater Show, which he founded. In 2008, he received Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes (National Arts and Sciences Prize), presented at the Palacio de Bellas Arts. This was followed by the Pillar of Theater in Mexico Medal at the Centro Cultural del Bosque in 2009, and the Clavis Palafoxianum from the state of Puebla in 2013. In 2014, Solé was honored at the Festival Internacional Cervantino, and accepted as a member of the International Theatre Institute of UNESCO. ==References== Category:1929 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Mexican male stage actors Category:Male actors from Mexico City ","title":"José Solé"},{"id":"46836267","text":"Pavlo Ivanovych Kotovenko (; born 25 March 1979 in Lviv) is a Ukrainian retired football player and coach. ==References== Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Ukrainian footballers Category:FC Lviv (1992) players Category:FC Karpaty-2 Lviv players Category:FC Rotor Volgograd players Category:Russian Premier League players Category:Ukrainian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Russia Category:FC Mordovia Saransk players Category:FC Obolon-Brovar Kyiv players Category:Ukrainian football managers Category:Association football midfielders ","title":"Pavlo Kotovenko"},{"id":"46836283","text":"Lactarius eucalypti is a species of milk-cap fungus in the family Russulaceae.

He was County Archivist for Bedfordshire between 1925 and 1938, County Archivist for Essex between 1938 and 1969, a founder member of the British Records Association and the Society of Archivists, and a winner of the John Bickersteth Medal in 1974 and the Medlicott Medal in 1987. He was also a prolific author who made a significant contribution to our understanding of the Elizabethan era through close analysis of the minutiae of local records of that age in Essex. ==Early life and education== Frederick George Emmison was born in Bedford on 28 May 1907. He was educated at Bedford Modern School where he excelled academically but was forced to abandon hopes of a University education when his father mistakenly thought a family investment had failed. ==Career== At the age of 16, Emmison joined the Bedfordshire Record Office in Bedford under the directorship of Dr G. H. Fowler, then Chairman of the Bedfordshire Records Committee. He was quick to master the work and earn the respect of the county with many important documents being deposited at the record office during his tenure by local churches in particular. Emmison was County Archivist for Bedfordshire between 1925 and 1938; and County Archivist at Essex Record Office in Chelmsford between 1938 and 1969. His \\"energetic and imaginative approach impressed many\\", and Essex was considered to have the leading record system in the country. In time the Essex Record Office became a publishing house for local history and Emmison became a prolific author. His Tudor Secretary: Sir William Petre at Court and Home was a \\"significant contribution to Tudor studies\\". His Elizabethan Life series \\"demonstrated the richness of sources for the period and his ability to relate local material to the wider canvas\\". Emmison was a founder member of the British Records Association in 1932 and the Society of Local Archivists in 1947. ==Family== In 1935 he married fellow archivist Margaret Moorhead Langwill, daughter of pioneering physician Alice Moorhead and her husband, Dr Hamilton Graham Langwill.

He graduated B.A. in 1664, and M.A. in 1674. On 10 December 1680 he was appointed rector of Stourmouth in Kent. He remained there till his deprivation in 1690, when he settled in London, and gathered a congregation at a house in Scroop's Court, in the parish of St. Andrew's, Holborn. He found a patron in Sir Thomas Fanshawe of Jenkins. ==Critic of the House of Commons== During the debates on the Recoinage Act, in 1695–6, Grascome was thought to have published An Account of the Proceedings in the House of Commons in relation to the Recoining the Clipt Money and Falling the Price of Guineas; Brunton writing in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography considers that the author may have been in fact Thomas Wagstaffe, with Grascome doing the legwork. Criticising the House of Commons of the time, which had pushed through the Great Recoinage of 1696, the author argued for a public record of the votes of Members of Parliament. Grascombe had done private research on placemen among them, listing over 100, since the 1692–3 session. The pamphlet contravened parliamentary privilege by giving a division list for the Recoinage Act. In November 1696 the House voted that the pamphlet was \\"false, scandalous, and seditious, and destructive of the freedom and liberties of parliament\\", ordered it to be burned by the common hangman, and petitioned the king to offer a reward for the discovery of the author. On 14 December a proclamation appeared for the apprehension of Grascome, but he escaped. The hunt did find Francis Turner, under an alias, who was arrested. In February 1699 the attorney-general was ordered to prosecute Grascome. The trial was postponed, and on 3 July it was dropped altogether, the printer, who was the only witness against him, having fled the country. It is suggested that Grascome came to an arrangement with the authorities. ==Later life== Grascome spent the last years of his life in theological controversy, defending the nonjurors, and denouncing dissent, occasional conformity, and the Roman Catholic church. He was a strong partisan, and Francis Lee thought that he had damaged the nonjurors' reputation with the government. ==Works== Grascome, in common with George Hickes, at one point used the printer William Anderton, who produced also Jacobite literature: in 1693 Anderton was found with Grascome's Remarks on the Present Confederacy. An Appeal of Murther, 1693, was Grascome's anonymous comment on the death sentence for Anderton. Grascome wrote also: * A Letter to a Friend in answer to a Letter against Mr. Louth in Defence of Dr. Stillingfleet, London, 1688. Edward Stillingfleet had written the tract referred to in 1684.

Wallace, Chairman, and Donald M.

The Board was created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt via Executive Order 8875 on August 28, 1941 and dissolved less than four months later. The purpose of the Supply Priorities and Allocation Board was to coordinate the distribution of materials and commodities related to national defense and to assist the Office of Production Management (OPM) in carrying out their overlapping duties. The Board's membership consisted of the Director General (William S. Knudsen) and Associate Director General (Sidney Hillman) of the OPM, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox, Administrator of the Office of Price Administration Leon Henderson, Chairman of the Economic Defense Board Henry A. Wallace (who was also the Vice President of the United States) and the Special Assistant to the President supervising the Lend-Lease program, Edward Stettinius, Jr. The President retained the power to appoint an Executive Director and to select the Chairman of the Board from its members. The only Chairman of SPAB during its short lifespan was Vice President Wallace and its sole Executive Director was businessman Donald M. Nelson. The Board's duties were essentially to determine how to best allocate the resources of the United States among the American public, allied militaries and the United States military which, at the time of SPAB's creation, had not yet entered the war. Critics complained that the Board's membership created several conflicts in the chain of command. For example, Henderson was Knudsen's inferior as director of a subdivision of the OPM but was his equal as a fellow Board member of SPAB. Regardless, SPAB was successful in increasing military aid to the Soviet Union, consistent with President Roosevelt's stated policy on Russia, despite strong opposition from the Office of Production Management and others. Less than four months after SPAB was created, the United States formally entered World War II when it declared war upon Japan on December 8, 1941. SPAB seemed poised to dramatically increase in importance.Herman, Arthur.

However, this increased significance was short-lived; on January 16, 1942, President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9024, establishing the War Production Board (WPB). The War Production Board superseded the Supply Priorities and Allocation Board and the Office of Production Management and absorbed both boards' duties. Donald M.

He attended Merchant Taylors' School before progressing, in 1643, to St John's College, Oxford.British History On-line Here he graduated in 1647 and became a fellow of the college. However, Oxford was a bastion of Royalism during the English Civil War which had ravaged the country since 1642, and after they had captured the king in 1647, an increasingly assertive parliament appointed a team of \\"Visitors\\" who descended on Oxford and expelled large numbers of academics, including Bell, from their positions. He is believed to have traveled to the European mainland in 1649, but was back in England by 1655 which was the year in which he was disqualified from a benefice in Norfolk. The Restoration of a (new) king in 1660 ushered in an improvement in the fortunes of William Bell who found himself appointed Chaplain to the Lieutenant of the Tower, a well connected politician called Sir John Robinson. He received a degree in Divinity in 1661 and in 1662 received the incumbency of the important west London parish of St Sepulchre's. This benefice was in the gift of his Oxford college, and his time as priest in charge of the parish was evidently a success. Further promotion followed in 1665 when he was appointed, in addition, a prebendary at nearby St Paul's Cathedral. Two years after that he was made a chaplain to the king. In 1671 he was appointed Archdeacon of St Albans, a post he held for twelve years till his death in July 1683. ==References== Category:Archdeacons of St Albans Category:17th-century English Anglican priests Category:1625 births Category:1683 deaths ","title":"William Bell (priest)"},{"id":"46836433","text":"Brewster Color was an early subtractive color-model film process. A two color process was invented by Percy Douglas Brewster in 1913, based on the earlier work of William Friese-Greene. It attempted to compensate for previous methods' problems with contrast. Brewster introduced a three color process in 1935, in an unsuccessful attempt to compete with Technicolor. ==Two color process== In his first patent application, filed February 11, 1913, American inventor Percy Douglas Brewster described a new color film process: Over the next eight years, Brewster filed a series of further patents pertaining to photographic film, film development, color cinematography, and various improvements to the process. In 1917, a patent for a method of \\"Coloring or Dyeing Photographic Images\\" was issued to Hoyt Miller, chief chemist of the Brewster Color Film Corporation, and assigned to the corporation. ===Use in motion pictures=== Brewster's process was used for the first color animated cartoon, 1920's The Debut of Thomas Cat. However the production company, Bray Pictures, deemed the process to be too expensive, and did not employ it again. As other color processes became available, Brewster Color continued to be preferred by some filmmakers due to its relatively low cost and greater availability for small production runs. It began to fall out of use in the late 1920s, in favor of the Prizma process. In April 1944, a syndicate was formed to purchase the rights to the Brewster Color process and use it to produce films at studios in New York and Washington, D.C. Stanley Neal, member of the syndicate and owner of its laboratory, was mainly known for the production of industrial films and advertising shorts. ==Three color process== In 1935, Brewster introduced a three color process which added yellow tinting. Though demonstration films received praise from members of the Royal Photographic Society for their \\"remarkable steadiness\\" and \\"extraordinarily good reds\\", this method failed to meet with commercial success. ==Brewster v. Technicolor== Brewster filed a lawsuit against Technicolor, Inc. and Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation on April 1, 1941. It sought $100,000 in damages and an injunction, stating that they had infringed on patents for a \\"method and apparatus for color cinematography.\\" On October 7, 1941, the judge overruled defense objections to some of the plaintiff's interrogatories. This procedural decision has been cited in some subsequent cases, as \\"2 F.R.D. 186, 51 U.S.P.Q. 319\\". No further public filings were made by Brewster, suggesting that the case may have been settled out of court. ==See also== * List of color film systems ==ReferencesExternal links== * Brewster at Timeline of Historical Film Colors Category:Film and video technology Category:History of film Category:Audiovisual introductions in 1913 Category:Audiovisual introductions in 1935 ","title":"Brewster Color"},{"id":"46836456","text":"The GR 14 is a Percurso pedestre de grande rota (long distance footpath with standard waymarking) in Portugal, which connects with a corresponding path into Spain.

They have been introduced by the Soviet and Russian Federation governmental organs and agencies and reflected in alteration of stamp denominations. == Historical notes == The issue of Russian postage stamps is directly related to postage rates in force at given times during the history of the Russian postal service. Stamp denominations were applied to meet a public need to pay postage costs according to the current rates. Issuing values for the revenue generation was not a purpose of the state policy in this area. Change of postage rates is an important aspect in studying the Russian postal history and collecting its items. Russian postage rates, especially those of the Soviet times, have not been thoroughly researched in philatelic literature. This part of the Russian postal history is less studied, with comments appearing within some other context. Alteration of the postage rates led to the increases in the face value of the stamps as reflected in the numbers printed and overcharged. Thus, the rates were often the reason to revalue current stamps, issue new postage stamps or use various surcharges. Soviet postal rates for the despatch and delivery of internal mail were changed numerous times. For example, there were about 30 rate changes during the period 1918 to 1966. Only over the first five years when the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic existed as a sovereign state, from the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 until the formation of the Soviet Union in 1922, postage rates changed 23 times. The early Soviet post office struggled to keep them up. Usually, new rates were introduced by special decrees of the Government. In a few cases, this was done by the circularised orders of the postal administration known as \\"post office circulars\\". The rates for international postage were established by the same People's Commissariat for Posts and Telegraphs, later superseding by the Ministry of Communications of the USSR. During the USSR period from 1923 up to 1967, postal rates were changed ten times. Following the RSFSR practice, there was a special supplementary rate in case of registered mail that was added to the normal postage charge. This procedure was in effect until 1948 when a specific rate was established for registered mail. Also, higher rates for special classes of mail existed from 1923 to 1938 that were used for: * “especially important” letters and packets, * “express” postal sendings (special delivery mail), * “special messenger” (for mail delivery to addresses more than 25 km from the nearest post office). File:Soviet Union stamp 1932 CPA 387.jpg5 kopecks File:1932 CFA 388.jpg10 kopecks File:1932 CFA 389.jpg80 kopecks An additional fee was charged for sending mail by air. Internal airmail rates were fixed in 1932 and those for international airmail in 1939. From 1936, the airmail rates were applied to regular operations all year round. For underpaid internal mail, there was a charge at the registration rate. Charge for underpaid international mail was double the deficient postage. Postal rates were based on the following gradation of letters by weight: * “ordinary” letters weighing up to 20 g were charged at regular rates, * letters weighing between 20 and 40 g were charged at double rates, * letters weighing 40 to 60 g were paid triple rates and so forth. Similar policy and practice of introducing postage rates have been continuing in the Russian Federation since 1992.

Saint Blaise (St. Vlaho), identified by medieval Slavs with the pagan god Veles, is the patron saint of the city of Dubrovnik and formerly the protector of the independent Republic of Ragusa. The church was built in 1715 by the Venetian architect and sculptor Marino Gropelli (1662-1728) on the foundations of the badly damaged Romanesque medieval church. He modeled the church on Sansovino's Venetian church of San Maurizio. The church consists of a single square nave with a ground plan in the form of an inscribed Greek cross, an apse flanked by two sacristies and an oblong cupola in the center. A flight of stairs leads to the portal, decorated with statues of angels. The facade is divided by four Corinthian columns. On top of the facade is a semicircular gable and a balustrade with three statues by Marino Gropelli: a free standing Saint Blaise (in the middle) and personifications of Faith and Hope. The barrel-vaulted interior is richly decorated in Baroque style. The Corinthian columns in the center bear the tambour of the cupola and lantern. The corners of the nave show blind cupolas. The main altar, in a combination of white and polychrome marble, shows in a high niche a precious, gilt silver Gothic statue of Saint Blaise, crafted in the 15th century by an unknown local master. The saint shows in his left hand a scale model of the Romanesque church which was destroyed by the earthquake in 1667. He is flanked by two kneeling angels. This statue was the only one to survive the fire of 1706.

The duo are best known for their tenure with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), from 2013 to 2017, under the respective ring names, Enzo Amore and Big Cass. After their separate departures from the WWE, the two reunited in 2019, when they appeared at G1 Supercard. ==HistoryEarly years=== Arndt and Morrissey first met each other whilst in their mid-teens during a game of basketball at The Cage in Manhattan, New York, nearly ten years before reuniting in WWE's developmental territory NXT, in July 2013. ===WWE=== NXT (2013–2016) On May 22, 2013, Enzo Amore debuted on NXT television, where he was quickly defeated by Mason Ryan. Colin Cassady debuted on NXT television on June 5, with a loss to Mason Ryan. On the July 3 episode of NXT, Amore and Cassady went on to form an alliance, and they labelled themselves \\"the realest guys in the room\\". Despite Amore and Cassady's alliance, Ryan easily defeated them in consecutive singles matches in July, but lost to them in a handicap match. After the feud with Ryan, Amore and Cassady went on to feud with Alexander Rusev, Scott Dawson and their manager Sylvester Lefort, turning face in the process. On the September 25 episode of NXT, Amore and Cassady participated in a gauntlet match for a future shot at the NXT Tag Team Championship; they started the match, first defeating CJ Parker and Tyler Breeze, then beating Rusev and Dawson, but fell to their final opponents, The Ascension (Konnor and Viktor). In November 2013, Amore suffered a broken leg while training, which led Cassady to try his hand at singles competition. Carmella in March 2015 Amore returned on June 26, 2014 episode of NXT, saving Cassady from an attack from Sylvester Lefort and Marcus Louis. In early August, Amore and Cassady participated in the NXT Tag Team Championship tournament. They defeated Jason Jordan and Tye Dillinger in the first round but were eliminated by The Vaudevillains (Aiden English and Simon Gotch) in the second round. Lefort and Louis then renewed their rivalry with Amore and Cassady by attacking them and shaving Amore's beard. As a result, Amore challenged Lefort to a match with the loser's hair as forfeit at NXT TakeOver: Fatal 4-Way. Amore proceeded to win the match but Lefort ran away, leaving his partner, Louis, to lose his hair and eyebrows at the hands of Amore and Cassady. Amore and Cassady then formed an alliance with the debuting Carmella. The duo had accidentally cost Carmella her hairdressing job as per the storyline, causing her to demand to get a job as a professional wrestler. Carmella had her televised in-ring debut on the October 16, 2014 episode of NXT. On the March 11, 2015 episode of NXT, Amore and Cassady defeated The Lucha Dragons to become the number one contenders for the NXT Tag Team Championship. At NXT TakeOver: Unstoppable, Amore and Cassady faced Blake and Murphy for the title in a losing effort after interference from Alexa Bliss. In December, Amore and Cassady began a feud with Dash and Dawson, where they challenged them for the NXT Tag Team Championship at both NXT TakeOver: London and Roadblock unsuccessfully. On the April 20 episode of NXT, the two took on the newly crowned NXT Tag Team Champions American Alpha, in a friendly non-title bout where they failed to defeat them, this was Amore and Cassady's last appearance in NXT. Main roster (2016–17) On the Raw after WrestleMania 32, Amore and Cassady debuted on the main roster and confronted The Dudley Boyz. A week later on SmackDown, Amore and Cassady defeated The Ascension in their main roster debut, in a tournament to determine the number one contenders for the WWE Tag Team Championship. The team went on to defeat The Dudley Boyz on the following week's Raw in the semi-final of the tag team tournament, advancing them to the finals. In the finals, they faced The Vaudevillains at Payback, with the match ending in a no contest after Amore suffered a legitimate concussion during the match. Around this time, Cassady's ring name changed to his former nickname, Big Cass. At the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, Enzo and Cass faced The New Day, The Vaudevillains and Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson, in a fatal-four way tag team match for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but The New Day retained their titles. On the July 4 edition of Raw, Enzo and Cass helped John Cena, who was getting attacked by The Club, involving themselves in the feud between Cena and The Club. As a result, Enzo and Cass teamed with Cena to face The Club in a six-man tag team match at Battleground, which they won. On July 19 at the 2016 WWE draft, Enzo and Cass were drafted to Raw brand. Following Battleground, Enzo and Cass proceeded to feud with Chris Jericho and Kevin Owens. The feud culminated at SummerSlam in a tag team match, which would ultimately be won by Jericho and Owens. On the August 22 episode of Raw, Cass, managed by Amore, defeated Rusev by count-out to qualify for a fatal-four way elimination match for the vacant Universal Championship. The next week on Raw, Cass faced Seth Rollins, Roman Reigns and Kevin Owens for the title, where he was the first man eliminated. On the November 7 episode of Raw, Enzo and Cass were announced as part of Team Raw for the 10–on–10 Survivor Series Tag Team Elimination match at Survivor Series, in which their team won. On the November 21 episode of Raw, after Amore was locked out of the locker room naked by Cass as a practical joke and ran into Lana in the hallway, her husband Rusev challenged Amore to a match later that night, in which Amore was quickly defeated. On the December 5 episode of Raw, after Amore stood up for Lana after seeing her and Rusev argue backstage, Lana invited Amore to her hotel room. Later that night, this was revealed to be a trap when Rusev attacked Amore in the hotel room. Over the following weeks, Enzo and Cass feuded with Rusev and Jinder Mahal. Cass lost a handicap match against Rusev and Jinder Mahal before teaming up with Amore to defeat the duo twice, ending the feud. On the February 20, 2017 episode of Raw, they would become the number one contenders for the Raw Tag Team Championship by defeating Cesaro and Sheamus. At Fastlane, they failed to capture the titles from Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson. On April 2 at WrestleMania 33, Enzo and Cass participated in a fatal-four way ladder match for the Raw Tag Team Championship against defending champions Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson, Cesaro and Sheamus, and the returning The Hardy Boyz, where The Hardy Boyz emerged victorious. The following night on Raw, Amore and Cass were defeated by Cesaro and Sheamus in a tag team match to determinate the number one contenders for the Raw Tag Team Championship. Split and feud (2017) On the May 22 episode of Raw, when Amore was attacked, Cass would tell the General Manager Kurt Angle to find the attacker before he does. The next week, Cass would accuse Corey Graves, then The Revival as Amore's attackers. On the June 5 episode of Raw, Cass was mysteriously attacked in the same manner as Amore and blamed his attack on Big Show, but Show denied this allegation. On the June 19 episode of Raw, it was revealed by Corey Graves that Cass was behind the attacks on Amore and that he faked his own attack in order to lure away suspicion that he was the attacker. Cass stated his frustration during his time teaming with Amore by accusing him of holding him down, calling him \\"dead weight\\". Cass then delivered a big boot to Amore, thus turning heel and disbanding the team. The following week on Raw, Amore called out Cass in order to make up and leave the attacks in the past. Cass would supposedly accept Amore's speech, but then attack him when they went up the entrance ramp. On July 9, Cass defeated Amore at Great Balls of Fire event. They continued to feud for the duration of the summer, with Amore eventually befriending Big Show. Show and Cass' ensuing series of altercations culminated in a match at SummerSlam with Amore locked inside a shark cage which hung over the ring. Although Amore escaped the cage, he was easily taken out by Cass, who would go on to defeat Big Show. On the August 21 episode of Raw, Cass faced Amore in a Street Fight, which Amore won by referee stoppage after Cass suffered a legitimate knee injury. ===Post-WWE (2018)=== In 2018, Arndt and Morrissey were released at separate times from WWE. Arndt pursued a rap music career under the moniker \\"Real1\\" and later \\"nZo\\", whilst Morrissey worked limited independent wrestling bookings. ===Ring of Honor (2019)=== Arndt and Morrissey reunited at the G1 Supercard show at Madison Square Garden. Following a tag team match involving Ring of Honor and New Japan Pro-Wrestling talent, the two jumped the barricade and attacked several wrestlers. The broadcast cameras cut away from the incident to indicate a legit outside attack, but it was later reported the angle was a worked shoot. Soon thereafter, the pair gave an interview with Sports Illustrated announcing that they had reformed as a tag team - now known as \\"nZo\\" (Arndt) and \\"CaZXL\\" (Morrissey). Collectively, they would be known as \\"FreeAgentZ\\". ==Other media== The team appears in three video games: WWE 2K16, WWE 2K17 and WWE 2K18. == Championships and accomplishments == *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **Ranked Enzo Amore No. 122 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 2016 ** Ranked Big Cass No. 120 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 2016 *WWE **NXT Year-End Award (1 time) ***Tag Team of the Year (2015) ==References External links == * * Category:WWE teams and stables Category:WWE NXT teams and stables ","title":"Enzo and Cass"},{"id":"46836591","text":"Eduard Yevgenyevich Malyi (; born 24 May 1969) is a former Russian football player and referee. ==Referee career== ;Assistant referee *Russian Third League: 1996–1997 *Russian Second Division: 1997–2001 *Russian First Division: 1997–2000 *Russian Top Division: 2000–2001 ;Referee *Russian Third League: 1997 *Russian Second Division: 1998–2011 *Russian Football National League: 2000–2012 *Russian Football Premier League: 2005–2012 ==References== Category:1969 births Category:Sportspeople from Volgograd Category:Living people Category:Soviet footballers Category:Russian footballers Category:FC Rotor Volgograd players Category:Russian Premier League players Category:Russian football referees Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:FC Avangard Kursk players ","title":"Eduard Malyi"},{"id":"46836614","text":"Chittenden & Kotting was an architectural partnership based in Detroit, Michigan.

In the late 1960s he created a character, \\"Dim Dunăreanu\\" who was a superhero for children and has been called the \\"Romanian James Bond\\". Zotta wrote under a pseudonym, Sandu Alexandru, often simultaneously with his given name. ==Biography== Ovidiu Zotta was born on 30 May 1935. In 1948 comic book publications in Romania ceased and a ban prevailed until the early 1960s. In the late 1960s and early 1970s a new genre of children's magazines emerged in such publications as Cravata roşie, Cutezătorii, and Luminiţa. The magazines were censored, but publication of comics soon soared. Zotta began drawing comics during this period as well as writing scripts. In 1967, using his pseudonym Sandu Alexandru, Zotta created a serial strip Aventurile lui Manolică, drawn by Bursch, along with the strip Vacanţele unui tânăr liniştit collaborating with Puiu Manu, who was using the pseudonym Vasile Baciu. This strip would be very important, as it was the birth of the comic strip character called \\"Dim Dunăreanu\\". Dunăreanu was an action hero created in the 1960s model. A communist children's hero, who was able to resolve serious situations without guns or blood but through his physical characteristics. Though Zotta created the character, other writers, like Puiu Manu wrote adventures for him. The character has been called the \\"Romanian James Bond\\". In the late 1970s, Zotta was acting as editor-in-chief of Cutezătorii and was also writing and drawing comic strips under the pseudonym \\"Sandu Alexandru\\". In 1978, he wrote the screenplay for Dan Mironescu's filming of Jachetele galbene, a movie based on Zotta's novel, Operaţiunea Hercule (Operation Hercules). He began to do a comic strip in the 1990s for Universul Copiilor called \\"Aventurile lui Teddy Ted\\" (The adventures of Teddy Ted). In addition to his work on comic strips, Zotta published children's literature. The literary magazine Observator Cultural listed Zotta as one of the leading writers of children's literature in Romania, among others such as Dumitru Almaș, Călin Gruia, Gica Iuteș, Octav Pancu-Iași, and Mircea Sântimbreanu. Zotta died in 1996. ==Selected worksBooks=== *Toți băieții sînt răi, toți băieții sînt buni Editura Ion Creangă: Bucharest (1970) (in Romanian) *O şansă pentru fiecare Editura Ion Creangă: Bucharest (1973) (in Romanian) *Operațiunea Hercule Editura Albatros: Bucharest (1973) (in Romanian) *Alexandru cel argintiu Editura Ion Creangă: Bucharest (1976) (in Romanian) * (\\"O şansă pentru fiecare\\" Translated by Cseke Gábor) Ló a pincében Editura Ion Creangă: Bucharest (1976) (in Hungarian) * (\\"Toți băieții sînt răi, toți băieții sînt buni\\" Translated by Natalie Alver) Kõik poisid on halvad, kõik poisid on head Eesti Raamat: Tallinn (1979) (in Estonian) *Jucătorul de rezervă Editura Ion Creangă: Bucharest (1980) (in Romanian) *Spadasinul de serviciu Editura Ion Creangă: Bucharest (1984) (in Romanian) *Insigna de pilot Editura Ion Creangă: Bucharest (1989) (in Romanian) ===Screenplay=== *\\"Jachetele galbene\\" (1979) ==References== Category:1935 births Category:1996 deaths Category:People from Iași Category:Romanian children's writers Category:Romanian screenwriters Category:Romanian male writers Category:Romanian comics writers Category:Male screenwriters Category:20th-century screenwriters ","title":"Ovidiu Zotta"},{"id":"46836745","text":"Talwar is a family name of Indian origin.

Chavez is an installation artist working often with data visualization, sound, and image projection. Additionally, she designed and created tools for STEAM education and learning, often with a focus on learning through art, language, and physics. She founded the art and education programs, sube.com and stemartslab.com and a co-founder of Paseo Project, an arts festival in Taos, New Mexico. == Early life and education == Chavez was born and raised in New York City. Her parents were both from Cuba and they came to the United States as refugees. In 1980, Chavez received an associate degree in Art from Miami Dade Community College. She went on to get her Bachelor of Fine Arts from California College of Arts and Crafts in 1984. In 1986, Chavez moved to Taos, New Mexico. == Artwork  Light Forms: Jungle Rhythms === Chavez showed Light Forms: Jungle Rhythms in March 1993 at the Millicent Rogers Museum in El Prado, New Mexico. This piece combines technology and an appreciation for nature. === (x) Trees === In 2009, Chavez began to work with data visualization combined with projection art and created the installation piece, (x)Trees which was later shown at ISEA 2012. (x)Trees was a highlighted work at ISEA 2012. Chavez also served as Education Program Director for ISEA2012: Machine Wilderness Education Day. (x)Trees uses live data which is taken from the internet and projects this information as tree-like images which grow and change. The work was a collaboration between herself and computer programmers who developed the algorithms for the trees. Her team for (x)trees at ISEA 2012 was made up of herself, Jared Tarbell and Allesandro Saccoia. The data used to create the trees was taken from particular search words used in tweets from Twitter and text messages. Twilio was used to generate trees from SMS text messages so that anyone viewing x(Trees) could shape and interact with the art. Chavez's intent with using social media and text to generate the virtual trees is to show how individuals are digitally connected to one another. (x)Trees can also be installed almost anywhere, including outdoors. === Projecting pARTicles === Chavez does a large amount of research for her artwork. While working on the interactive installation, Projecting pARTicles, she collaborated with Dr. Steven Goldfarb, ATLAS Experiment at CERN to immerse herself in particle physics. She continued with a research stay in 2015, presenting outcomes at the CERN library. === Origination Point === Origination Point is a multimedia installation created in collaboration with Marcel Schwittlick (visual artist/software programmer) and Robert Schirmer (interactive sound). The installation uses sounds and vibrations of the Earth as recorded by NASA along with visuals of objects that look like particles and cells. === 12th Havana Biennial === In May 2015, Chavez showed her physics inspired work, Origination Point and the Projecting Particles youth workshop at the 12th Havana Biennial (Bienal de la Habana) in Cuba. She was invited by a curator from the Havana Biennial who saw (x)Trees at ISEA 2012. Projecting Particles at the Havana Biennial allowed young people to create \\"physics- inspired projection art\\" that was collaborative and took place on the streets of Havana. Projecting Particles at the Havana Biennial was made possible by a team of four, including Chavez as the creative lead. The others in the group were Markus Dorninger, a projection painter, Malu Tavares, a documentary filmmaker, and Dr. Luis Flores Castillo, physicist at CERN. == Educational work == Chavez developed a new business in the mid 1990s. When her son was two years old, Chavez wanted to teach him to speak Spanish. She began to teach Spanish and at her son's preschool as a way to supplement income from her art. The process of teaching at the preschool gave Chavez an idea for a possible business. Chavez created a curriculum called Sube: Teaching Language thru Art, Music & Games, which is designed to help teachers inspire children to learn English and Spanish interactively. Sube allows teachers to use a multi-sensory approach to learning language and is divided into several different themes. The name, SUBE is a play on the Spanish verb, subir, meaning \\"to go up.\\" Chavez created a business, Sube, Inc. out of the kit, which was noted to \\"fill an educational void.\\" Chavez is the founder of STEMArts, which brings science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) projects to young people in schools and at workshops. STEMArts is part of Sube, inc. Since 2014, Chavez and Matt Thomas are the co-founders of Paseo Project, a yearly, interactive and community-focused arts festival in Taos, New Mexico. == References  External links == * Category:Living people Category:American installation artists Category:American people of Cuban descent Category:American women installation artists Category:Artists from New York City Category:California College of the Arts alumni Category:Miami Dade College alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:21st-century American women artists ","title":"Agnes Chavez"},{"id":"46836771","text":"Alexander Klevan is Russian-born Israeli painter was born on 12 October 1950, Russia;( אלכסנדר קלבן).

In 1995, the company headquarters and sales staff moved to Boca Raton, Florida and to Delray Beach, Florida in 2004. ==History== The company was started after William Sucher, a typewriter repairman, took a Lee–Enfield rifle in trade against a typewriter he had repaired for a customer. Having no need for the rifle, he posted a newspaper to sell it and received more queries about the rifle than he had for typewriters. He then sought sources of surplus rifles that he could sell for a profit. With his brother-in-law, Manny Weigensberg, Sucher made contacts in foreign countries for the importation of military surplus rifles and handguns and by the 1970s, Century became the single largest importer of firearms in the United States and Canada.

He is currently director emeritus of the Research Group in Behavioral Neurobiology at the GIGA Neurosciences of the University of Liège. == Career == Jacques Balthazart obtained his PhD in Zoological Sciences from the University of Liège in 1977 and was then for one year a post-doctoral fellow at Rutgers University in Newark, N.J, where he worked under the leadership of Professor Mei Fang Cheng and Harvey Feder. He was Adjunct Faculty at Rockefeller University in 1987-1989 and has since organized and developed a research group in Behavioral Neuroendocrinology at the University of Liège where he has continuously worked from 1979 till now. His publications on Researchgate reach the score of 7084 downloads, 14529 citations et 29.788 views., and his score on Google Scholar reaches 17 355 quotations, which ranks him in the top 1% of the scientists category. He is Co-Editor-in-Chief of the journal Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology published by Elsevier and one of the three Editors of the Oxford Series in Behavioral Neuroendocrinology, a collection of books published by Oxford University Press.

He is an active member of multiple scientific societies including the Society for Neuroscience, the Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology of which he has been president in 2003-2005) , The Endocrine Society, la Société Européenne des Neurosciences, la Society for Animal Behavior. === Research === Research by Jacques Balthazart and his group addresses various topics in behavioral neuroendocrinology but focuses mostly on the sexual differentiation of brain and behavior and on the role of brain aromatase (estrogen synthase) in the activation of male sexual behavior. Several of these topics were covered in more detail in the scientific magazine of the University of Liège called Reflexion. This web site namely contains a detailed description in French and in English of his research concerning : * The rapid changes in brain aromatase activity and the rapid effects of estrogens on sexual behavior; * The important steroid-dependent brain plasticity observed in song birds, * The role of olfaction in the control of avian reproduction. His publications can also be found in the repository of the University of Liège called ORBI. He published in 2010 a book in French entitled Biologie de l'homosexualité. On nait homosexuel, on ne choisit pas de l'être summarizing the current knowledge on the biological mechanisms that control sexual orientation in animals and humans. This book has been often discussed and reviewed as scientific attempt to reduce the gap between the American and English approach in neurobiology on the subject of homosexuality, and the south-European vision which is more based on psychology and psycho- analysis. Radio channels like France Culture have organized debates over this change or perspective Newspapers like Le Monde, the Nouvel Observateur have extensively commented his works, and a 50 minutes TV documentary, produced by Mona Lisa Corp, titled Homo ou hétéro, est-ce un choix ?, by Thierry Berrod, has been aired on French national channel France 3 that has given a large audience to his theories, after being featured in Belgium on national TV RTBF in November 2014. Spain and Italy have reacted as well, following the English translation by Oxford University Press. A shorter presentation of the scientific data including an overview on sex differences is also available in English as a paper or ebook (cf.\\"Brain development and Sexual orientation\\", see full references in the list below). A summary of these facts is also presented in the Reflexions Web site of the University of Liege. This book also supports the scientific argument developed in Christian Combaz' historical and sociological essay Les âmes douces in which Jacques Balthazart is often quoted as a scientific counsellor. == Publications == The full list of the more than 380 publications of Jacques Balthazart can be found on the PUBMED web site that gathers all the biomedical scientific literature and where the author has his own page. === Edited books === * Aspects of Avian Endocrinology: Practical and Theoretical Implications, with C.G.

Altman also played an instrumental role in its embrace of Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs), as environments in which to organize communities with substantial senior populations. As Altman herself puts it, an increasing number of seniors must be enabled “to age in place.”Vladeck, Fredda, and Anita Altman. \\"The Future of the NORC-Supportive Service Program Model.\\" Public Policy & Aging Report (2015): pru050. Altman was instrumental in promulgating the program concepts pioneered at Penn South, a union-sponsored, moderate-income housing co-op in Manhattan's Chelsea community, There, a program with the express goal of helping senior residents to remain living in their own home, even as they grew older and frailer, was organized. This supportive service program (SSP), mobilized the community and built partnerships between senior residents, housing management, and health and social service agencies to achieve that end. With the support of the Robert Wood Foundation, the program was successfully replicated and in 1994 the New York State Legislature passed the first NORC-SSP legislation in the country, providing matching grants to an original 10 programs. This was followed in 1999 by the establishment of the New York City NORC funded by its City Council. Today in New York State there are over 50 publicly funded NORC- SSP communities with over 60,000 senior residents living in supportive communities. In 1993, Altman convened a group of authorities in related fields to address the question of domestic violence in the Jewish community. This resulted in her founding the professionally led UJA-Federation Task Force on Family Violence, which in 2001 received the New York State Governor's COURAGE award. Altman herself was honored for this work in 2008 when she received the Woman of Valor award from the New York Board of Rabbis. Altman also founded the UJA-Federation Task Force on People with Disabilities which became a vehicle for planning, learning and advocacy that has brought, in partnership with the J. E. & Z.B. Butler Foundation and its agency network the transformation of services for people with disabilities and their families in many communities throughout the New York metro area. ==ReelAbilities Film Festival== During her work with the UJA Task Force on People with Disabilities, Altman recognized that policy needed to go hand in hand with changes in public perception and culture: “We are in the midst of a civil rights movement. People with disabilities are increasingly making their voice and presence known and wanting us, the rest of the society, to step up to the plate.” She believed that films could be an effective medium to help create wider public awareness about people with disabilities. In partnership with the Jewish Community Center in Manhattan, she founded ReelAbilities: New York Disabilities Film Festival. As a UJA-Federation press release put it, it was and remains “the brainchild of Anita Altman.” ReelAbilities is now the largest film festival in the country dedicated to promoting awareness and appreciation of people with different disabilities, with 13 cities currently sponsoring festivals in their own communities. Altman herself has said, “It is a festival with a social mission, namely to change public perception and understanding of who are people with disabilities.” ==References== Category:Living people Category:1945 births Category:City College of New York alumni Category:Jewish feminists Category:Disability rights activists from the United States Category:People from the Bronx ","title":"Anita Altman"},{"id":"46836886","text":"Mittagong Lions Rugby League Football Club is an Australian rugby league football club based in Mittagong, New South Wales.

She was also the co-founder of the artist-run restaurant, FOOD where she was the main investor. == Biography == Goodden was born in London, UK during World War II and was a world traveler. In the 1970s, she was in New York where she worked as a documentary photographer and dancer. In 2007, she had moved to New Mexico. == Work == Much of Goodden's photography documented the ephemeral art work of the 1970s New York art scene. She became an artistic collaborator with her boyfriend and fellow artist, sculptor Gorden Matta- Clark. Goodden documented his art, such as tagging hair clumps and tying them to a wire cage which she later photographed. for Hair (1972) She also documented Matta-Clark's Jacks in 1971. Because of the ephemeral nature of Matta-Clark's art, documentation was important for understanding what the art looked like. === Dance and performance === Goodden was a founding member of the Trisha Brown Dance Company in 1970. Goodden was a participant in many of Trisha Brown's dance performances. On April 1970, she was part of the original cast of Brown's Leaning Duets which took place near Wooster Street in New York City. In 1973, she danced in Raft Piece, Spanish Dance and Scallops, the last of which was performed at the Festival d'Automne in the Musee Gallera in Paris on October 6. In 1974, she performed Figure 8 with Brown's troupe in Rome at the Contemporanea Festival on January 2, and on June 2, she danced at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Drift. In 1977, she conducted a series of poetry readings at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). Like her documentation of Matta-Clark, Goodden also documented dance performances such as Brown's 1971 Walking on the Wall and other routines such as Man Walking Down the Side of a Building. === FOOD === FOOD was founded in 1971 by Goodden, Matta-Clark, Suzanne Harris and Rachel Lew. Goodden had been hosting artistic- themed dinner parties for friends, such as flora-themed dinner event where the guests dressed as edible flowers. She found that the idea of creating a restaurant that served fresh food in a communal setting appealed to her. Goodden received money from her family to invest in FOOD. Matta-Clark considered it to be a \\"restaurant around the idea of an art project.\\" She documented FOOD through photography. FOOD only lasted about three years. However, in that time and under the direction of Goodden, Matta-Clark and Tina Girouard who was part of FOOD the first year, when Suzanne Harris and Rachel Lew dropped out shortly after the running of FOOD began, it became an important artistic hub. While Goodden was in charge, she and others helped create a sense of \\"cohesion within the community and infrastructure to support it.\\" Goodden \\"curated\\" many different artists who worked at FOOD full-time or sporadically, depending on an artists' schedule. She made sure that the artist-chefs were paid well and had flexible schedules. Goodden's philosophy in running FOOD was to provide a place where artists could work for a fair wage and have a flexible schedule changed the nature of art-production itself, moving it away from institutional spaces or gallery-spaces and into a new arena: the kitchen. Matta-Clark became bored with FOOD when the novelty of working there waned for him, which started to happen by 1972. Goodden began to feel \\"overwhelmed by the managerial duties\\" for which she became almost solely responsible until she hired Kushner as an assistant manager. In addition, FOOD did not make money for its owners and Goodden nearly lost her family inheritance by investing in the restaurant. Goodden had hoped that even though she provided the bulk of the money for FOOD that more people would help share in the work \\"for the benefit of all\\" and that the project itself could be sustainable. However, the restaurant closed its doors in 1974. Goodden wrote, \\"Though we consumed food, Food consumed us.\\" === Anarchitecture === Goodden was a member of the Anarchitecture group which met and showed work in New York. While Anarchitecture is often solely associated with Matta-Clark, \\"it had a broad membership of equally significant artists, including Laurie Anderson, Tina Girouard, Carol Goodden, Suzanne Harris, Jene Highstein, Bernard Kirschenbaun, Richard Landry and Richard Nonas among others.\\" Anarchitecture was formed in 1973 and met weekly until 1974. The Anarchitecture show critiqued the ideas behind art and especially architecture and land ownership. Goodden's photographs, along with fellow Anarchitecture members was shown at the Greene gallery in March, 1974. The anonymous Anarchitecture show critiqued the unchanging nature or \\"stasis\\" of the architecture of the time. Some of the ideas surrounding the themes in Anarchitecture were derived from the loss of Goodden's fortune, leading to the use of the slogan, \\"Nothing Works.\\" === Recent work === In 2013, Goodden came back to cook during the Frieze Art Fair in New York. Curator, Cecilia Alemani commissioned a project to \\"recreate\\" FOOD during the fair. Goodden prepared her own recipes, Carrot Soup Español and Cauliflower Cress Soup, on May 10, 2013 for the Frieze Art Fair. Goodden has continued to provide artistic direction and historical reference to art from the period of time surrounding FOOD and Anarchitecture. == References == Category:Living people Category:Photographers from New York (state) Category:Businesspeople from New York (state) Category:20th-century American businesspeople Category:20th- century American businesswomen Category:American food company founders Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Carol Goodden"},{"id":"46836929","text":"The Democratic Swarajya Party was a political party in British India.

New York Times columnist for Bedside from 2012-2015, she was previously a contributor to the Times blog \\"Well\\". Her first book, Critical Care, was published in 2010 by Harper Studio, an imprint of HarperCollins, (published in paperback, April 2011, by HarperOne). Her second book, The Shift, will be released on September 22, 2015, published by Algonquin Books. ==Early years and education== Brown grew up in Springfield, MO. Her father was a professor of Philosophy at Missouri State University and her mother was a social worker. She received a B.A. and a Ph.D in English from the University of Chicago and an M.A. from Columbia University. Brown taught writing and literature at Harvard, MIT, and Tufts. ==Nursing career== After a few years in academia, Brown decided to make a career change. She completed an accelerated one-year program at the University of Pittsburgh and became a licensed Registered Nurse. Brown's nursing practice has focused on oncology, palliative care and hospice. ==Writing career== In her first year as an oncology nurse, Brown experienced the sudden death of a patient and to process the experience, wrote an essay titled \\"Perhaps Death is Proud\\" (based on the poem Death Be Not Proud by John Donne). She submitted the piece to The New York Times, which published it on September 8, 2008.https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/09/health/09case.html Shortly after the publication of her essay, Brown began receiving interest from publishers and agents across the country. The essay was included in Best American Science Writing 2009 and Best American Medical Writing 2009.http://www.shesource.org/experts/profile/theresa-brown Brown became a regular paid contributor to The New York Times, and her August 19, 2009 post on the Times blog \\"Well\\", “A Nurse’s View of Health Reform,” caught the White House's attention. President Obama quoted from Brown's blog post in a speech advocating for the Affordable Care Act.http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/16/nurse-brown-goes-to-washington Brown's first book, Critical Care, was acquired by Bob Miller and published by HarperStudio in June 2010. Critical Care takes readers through Brown's first year as a nurse, her \\"first code, first death and first Condition A (a sudden death due to cardiac arrest). We learn, as she did, that what's behind the scenes of health care is a chaotic, bureaucratic maze. We see that nursing is as much about time-management and tenacity as it is about medicine.\\" Schools of Nursing use Critical Care as a textbook. ==Writing about bullying== Theresa's editorial \\"Physician, Heel Thyself\\" appeared in The New York Times on May 8, 2011. Covering the subject of physician-nurse bullying Brown wrote: \\"...because doctors are at the top of the food chain, the bad behavior of even a few of them can set a corrosive tone for the whole organization. Nurses in turn bully other nurses, attending physicians bully doctors-in-training, and experienced nurses sometimes bully the newest doctors\\".https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/08/opinion/08Brown.html The piece ignited discussion on the subject of Bullying in medicine in blogs, healthcare publications and mainstream media outlets. Physicians Kevin Pho Kevin Pho and Ford Vox, (writing in The Atlantic), published responses to the piece questioning whether doctors should be held solely accountable for bullying in the hospital. The piece was also discussed in the American Journal of Nursing by editor Maureen Shawn Kennedy. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Health care quality Category:Living people Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:American medical writers Category:Women medical writers Category:Writers from Springfield, Missouri Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:American nurses Category:American women nurses Category:21st-century American writers Category:21st-century American women writers ","title":"Theresa Brown (author)"},{"id":"46837180","text":"Richard Alston is professor of Roman history at Royal Holloway, University of London.

He left it because he needed to work. At 17 years old, he started playing drums, having influences as Dave Grohl, Matt Cameron and Dave Abbruzzese. He moved to Madrid in 1992 where, by an advert published in a newspaper by Cristina Llanos, he joined the music group Dover. Later he would become partner of Amparo for a couple of years; even with the breakup as a couple they remained in the group. He organized his time working and playing for the group, until one day he met Julio Ruiz, director of the radio program Disco Grande from Radio 3, whom he asked a favor to play a demo of the group. Julio set it up and he liked it a lot. Shortly after, Dover released their first album \\"Sister\\", although international musical success would lead with their next album, \\"Devil Came to Me\\" (he designed the cover, as it was a graphic designer), which made the group live from music and make tours around different countries. After a few albums more, in 2006, \\"Follow the city lights\\" was released, turning its music genre to electronics. A few years later, the album \\"I Ka Kené\\" was published and had a strong influence of African sounds. Jesús was commissioned to produce and mix multiple tracks of these albums. In February 2015, they released a new album, \\"Complications\\", with which they returned to their origins of rock. Jesús is characterized by very cheerful and funny, having starred in several stories, like doing a couple of concerts totally naked.

Hampton was the running mate of gubernatorial candidate Matt Bevin in the 2015 election. A Republican, Hampton was the first African-American to hold statewide office in Kentucky history and the third African-American woman to have served as lieutenant governor of a U.S. state. ==Early life and education== Jenean Michelle Hampton was born on May 12, 1958 and raised in Detroit, Michigan, one of four daughters born to Donald and Marie Hampton. Her parents divorced when she was seven years old, leaving her mother to raise Hampton and her sisters on her own. Hampton's mother struggled because she lacked a high school diploma. After Hampton graduated from high school, she worked for five years in the automotive industry in order to help pay for her college education. She earned an Industrial Engineering degree from Wayne State University in 1985. She later earned a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Rochester. ==Military and business career== Hampton speaking to members of the Kentucky National Guard in February 2016 Hampton served in the United States Air Force for seven years as a computer systems officer, eventually attaining the rank of Captain. During Operation Desert Storm, she was deployed to Saudi Arabia. While stationed in Saudi Arabia, Hampton was responsible for radar software used in tracking enemy planes and in search and rescue missions. Hampton spent 19 years working in the corrugated packaging industry, eventually reaching the position of plant manager. ==Political career== A Republican, Hampton first sought political office in 2014. That year, she unsuccessfully challenged State Representative Jody Richards. Hampton has been active in her local party and in the Tea Party Movement. Hampton was selected by Matt Bevin as his running mate for Governor of Kentucky in 2015. On November 3, 2015, Bevin and Hampton defeated the Democratic ticket of Attorney General Jack Conway and State Representative Sannie Overly in the 2015 Kentucky gubernatorial election. Bevin and Hampton were sworn in to their respective posts on December 8, 2015. Hampton is the first African-American to hold statewide office in Kentucky history and the third black woman to serve as lieutenant governor of a U.S. state. She is the 57th Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky. Bevin did not select Hampton as his running mate in his 2019 re- election bid. Her term expired in December 2019. After Bevin lost the general election, Hampton stated that she had voted for Libertarian nominee John Hicks instead of Bevin. ==Personal life== Hampton lives in Bowling Green, Kentucky.

He played at club level for Bradford Northern, Carlisle, Warrington (loan) (Heritage № 887), Batley and Doncaster (Heritage № 597), as a , or , i.e. number 1, 6, or 7, and coached at club level for West Bowling A.R.L.F.C. and Staincliffe ARLFC, and played cricket for Buttershaw St. Paul's Cricket Club. Having suffered a number of minor strokes in the past, he was found unconscious at home in Batley during the early-afternoon of Wednesday 19 May 2015, and he suffered heart attacks en route to Dewsbury and District Hospital, Dewsbury before being transferred to Pinderfields Hospital, Wakefield, having suffered cerebral hypoxia. Never regaining consciousness, life support was removed on Saturday 23 May 2015, and he died during the morning of Sunday 24 May 2015. ==Background== Carroll was born in Spen Valley West Riding of Yorkshire, England. ==Playing careerCounty Cup Final appearances=== Dean Carroll played , and scored a goal, and a 2-drop goals in Bradford Northern's 7-18 defeat by Hull F.C. in the 1982–83 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1982–83 season at Elland Road, Leeds on Saturday 2 October 1982. ===Club career=== Dean Carroll initially played rugby league for St John Fisher Catholic School, and Batley Boys ARLFC before joining Bradford Northern. He made his début for Bradford Northern against Blackpool Borough in 1980. Following the arrival of Wales international rugby union scrum-half Terry Holmes from Cardiff RFC in 1985, Dean Carroll felt his first-team opportunities at Bradford Northern would be limited, and consequently he transferred to Carlisle. In hindsight, the number of injuries sustained by Terry Holmes would actually have meant more opportunities at Bradford Northern than Dean Carroll had envisaged. He made his début for Warrington on Sunday 5 March 1989, and he played his last match for Warrington on Sunday 16 April 1989. ==Outside of rugby league== Dean Carroll was a pupil at St Mary's Catholic Primary School in Batley and St John Fisher Catholic School in Dewsbury, during his working life he was employed at Fox's Biscuits, Batley.

Cir. 1994) was a 1994 decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on the patent eligibility of data structures. The decision, which reversed a PTO rejection of data structure claims, was followed by a significant change in PTO policy as to granting software related patents, a cessation of PTO appeals to the Supreme Court from reversals of PTO rejections of software patent applications, an increasing lenity at the Federal Circuit toward such patents and patent applications, and a great increase in the number of software patents issued by the PTO. ==Background== Edward S. Lowry filed a computer software patent application in which he described an application program that managed database information by using software data structures that he called \\"attribute data objects\\" (ADOs). An ADO is a single primitive data element \\"compris[ing] sequences of bits which are stored in the memory as electrical (or magnetic) signals that represent information.\\"Lowry, 32 F.3d at 1580-81. According to Lowry's patent application, \\"[a]n attribute expresses the idea that one thing is attributed to another thing.\\" Thus, the Attributive data model capitalizes on the concept that a database is a collection of attributions, whereby information is represented in terms of its characteristics and relationships to other information. Lowry asserted that using ADOs provided a more efficient method for storing, retrieving, adding, and removing information from a database. Claim 1 was considered representative. It provided: > 1\\\\. A memory for storing data for access by an application program being > executed on a data processing system, comprising: a data structure stored in > said memory, said data structure including information resident in a > database used by said application program and including: a plurality of > attribute data objects stored in said memory, each of said attribute data > objects containing different information from said database; a single holder > attribute data object for each of said attribute data objects, each of said > holder attribute data objects being one of said plurality of attribute data > objects, a being-held relationship existing between each attribute data > object and its holder attribute data object, and each of said attribute data > objects having a being-held relationship with only a single other attribute > data object, thereby establishing a hierarchy of said plurality of attribute > data objects; a referent attribute data object for at least one of said > attribute data objects, said referent attribute data object being > nonhierarchically related to a holder attribute data object for the same at > least one of said attribute data objects and also being one of said > plurality of attribute data objects, attribute data objects for which there > exist only holder attribute data objects being called element data objects, > and attribute data objects for which there also exist referent attribute > data objects being called relation data objects; and an apex data object > stored in said memory and having no being-held relationship with any of said > attribute data objects, however, at least one of said attribute data objects > having a being-held relationship with said apex data object. The examiner rejected all of Lowry's claims as so-called printed matter. That is, they were directed to information stored on a medium (\\"substrate\\") without any unobvious cooperation between the medium and the information to provide a useful function.This test comes from the Federal Circuit’s decision in The PTO Board of Appeals sustained the examiner's rejection of all claims. The claimed data structures were stored into a computer memory, but they did not sufficiently interact with the memory to provide a functional relationship with it. Accordingly, the ADOs were not \\"patentably distinguished\\" from the prior art,The Kumpati patent was \\"a CPU using a memory and containing stored data in a data structure,\\" so the Board found that it made the claimed ADOs unpatentable. making them obvious or anticipated, and thus unpatentable. Lowry then appealed to the Federal Circuit. ==Federal Circuit opinion== On appeal, the Federal Circuit panel reversed the Board's rejection of the patent application. The court held, per Judge Rader, that all of Lowry's software data structure claims were patentable. It disagreed, first, that the ADOs were printed matter. It said that a data structure stored in a memory does not convey \\"intelligence to a reader.\\" It had to \\"be processed . . . by a machine, the computer'\\" to do that. That kept the ADOs from being printed matter: \\"The printed matter cases have no factual relevance where the invention as defined by the claims requires that the information be processed not by the mind but by a machine, the computer.\\"Lowry, 32 F.3d at 1583. This is based on and quotes In re Bernhart, 417 F.2d 1395, 1399 (C.C.P.A. 1969). See Piano roll blues Wikipedia article for further discussion of this doctrine. The court also maintained that Lowry's claimed data structure did sufficiently interact with the substrate (the computer memory) to satisfy the functional relationship standard. The court asserted that, at the lowest physical level, storing data structures into a memory actually imposed a physical organization on that memoryLowry, 32 F.3d at 1583. This is equivalent to saying that a computer program converts a computer into a new machine by programming it, as in Bernhart and as discussed in the Piano roll blues article. Moreover, the court said, storing the ADOs into computer memory resulted in more efficient computer operation.Lowry, 32 F.3d at 1584. There was a functional relationship between the ADOs and memory, the court maintained, even though a human being could not see any physical changes. The examiner and Board had denied this. They said that the provision of new signals to be stored by the computer does not make it a new machine, i.e. the computer is structurally the same, \\"no matter how new, useful and unobvious the result.\\" The court replied: To this question we say that if a machine is programmed in a certain new and unobvious way, it is physically different from the machine without that program; its memory elements are differently arranged. The fact that these physical changes are invisible to the eye should not tempt us to conclude that the machine has not been changed.Lowry, 32 F.3d at 1583. This is quoted from the Bernhart case. The court stated: \\"The PTO did not establish that the ADOs, within the context of the entire claims, lack a new and nonobvious functional relationship with the memory.\\" Under prevailing Federal Circuit patent law doctrine, the court noted, it was the burden of the PTO to prove that this relationship was obvious.See Since that had not been done, the Federal Circuit said, the rejection must be reversed. ==Impact and aftermath== The Lowry case marked a turning point in the Federal Circuit's patent-eligibility analysis of computer software cases and the PTO's policy about issuing such patents. The Federal Circuit began to abandon the policy reflected in such cases as In re Schrader, See Software patents under United States patent law#Pre-1994 period. which emphasized the importance of hardware elements to provide patent eligibility for software,See Freeman-Walter-Abele Test. and developed its own standards for patent eligibility that were different from those of Supreme Court precedents. Eventually, according to a 2006 dissenting opinion of several Supreme Court Justices, the Federal Circuit evolved a legal standard for patent eligibility under which it held claims patent eligible \\"where this Court has held the contrary.\\"Laboratory Corp. of Amer. Holdings v. Metabolite Laboratories, 548 U.S. 124, 136 (2006). After the Lowry decision, the PTO stopped resisting the grant of software-related patents. In a series of cases from Gottschalk v. Benson and Parker v. Flook in the early 1970s to Diamond v. Diehr in the early 1980s, the Department of Justice had supported the Patent Office and PTO's appeals from judicial decisions overturning the agency's rejections of computer software patents. But the Solicitor General’s office (which is in charge at the Justice Department of appeals to the Supreme Court) declined to allow the PTO to seek Supreme Court review of Lowry, allegedly \\"because it [Lowry] was a confusing and unsuitable vehicle.\\"George Washington Univ. Law School, Computer Law, ch. 8-C, Note 3. \\"The USPTO gets ready to throw in the towel,\\" cartoon published in IEEE Micro in July 1995 In addition, personnel changes at the Justice Department and PTO occurred that lessened support for such appeals.See Software Patents; George Washington Univ. Law School, Computer Law, ch. 8-C, Beauregard case, Note 3 (\\"It seemed time for the PTO to throw in the towel.\\"). A cartoon in IEEE Micro magazine illustrated the point. GAO Analysis of US PTO Data Showing Number of Software and Non-Software Patents Issued Each Year From 1991 to 2011 After 1994, therefore, the PTO began to issue many software and business-method patents. In 1991, software related patents represented about 20 percent of the yearly total; by 2011 they accounted for about 50 percent. The absolute number of software patents rose from about 25,000 per year to 125,000 per year in this period. An accompanying graph shows a GAO analysis of such data. This course of action continued until well after 2000, when substantial personnel changes had occurred both within the PTO and the Federal Circuit. These changes led to the Federal Circuit's In re Bilski decision that led to Bilski v. Kappos and in 2013 the Supreme Court's decision followed in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International.

The training cadre, consisting of several Laotian graduates of the U.S. Special Forces (USSF) course at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in the United States,Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 19. were converted into the core of an elite Special Commando Company (French: Compagnie Commando Speciale – CCS) or SPECOM for short, directly under the commanding officer of the 2nd Strike Division, Brigadier general Thao Ty.Conboy and McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960–75 (1989), p. 13.Conboy and Greer, War in Laos 1954–1975 (1994), p. 61. Initial progress was rapid and by mid-1972 SPECOM had expanded from a single understrength company to two airborne reconnaissance (recon) companies; a third was raised in mid-1973 when 140 former para-commandos were transferred from the Savannakhet-based irregular Commando Raider Teams (CRTs)Conboy and McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960–75 (1989), pp. 41–42, Plate C3.Conboy and Greer, War in Laos 1954–1975 (1994), p. 39. and a heavy weapons company was added, bringing the unit to battalion strength. ==Structure and organization== By early 1974, SPECOM strength reached 412 Officers and enlisted men, all airborne-qualified volunteers, organized into a reinforced battalion comprising one headquarters (HQ), four company HQ sections, three recon companies – 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, each broken into 12-men teams – and a heavy weapons company (4th).Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 19. The unit was headquartered in Seno, near Savannakhet and was subordinated to the 2nd Strike Division until the latter formation's disbandment in April of that same year, when the former was transferred to the RLA Airborne Forces command.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 19. ==Operational history 1972–75== The missions performed by SPECOM during its brief existence were varied, ranging from long-range strategic and tactical reconnaissance to deep-penetration raids, pathfinding, crash-site recovery, reinforcement and riot control duties. The first true combat assignment of the SPECOM occurred in late 1972, when they were used to secure a H-34 helicopter crash site north-east of Seno. In the opening months of 1973, SPECOM recon teams were sent to Thakhek to bolster its defences when North Vietnamese Army (NVA) units began pressuring the city. By mid-year elements of the unit were heli-lifted again north-east of Seno to place a listening station near the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the main NVA supply route extended through Laos. A planned SPECOM assault into the national capital Vientiane after renegade Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) officers led by former Brigadier general Thao Ma captured Wattay Airbase in August was cancelled when their coup attempt quickly fell apart.http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_349.shtml Retrieved 30 April 2012.

In April 1974 SPECOM's 2nd recon company was moved to Vientiane to provide VIP security to rightist members of the new coalition government.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 19. ===Disbandement=== In May 1974 the FAR High Command dissolved the ineffective 2nd Strike Division and elements of its three understrength brigades were re- organized into three new parachute battalions (French: Bataillons de Parachutistes – BP), the 711er, 712e, and 713e BPs grouped into the RLA's 7th Para Brigade raised at Seno. SPECOM was then converted into the brigade's fourth parachute battalion, 714e BP.Conboy and McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960–75 (1989), p. 47, Plate G3. Elements of 714e BP were deployed in early 1975 to Thakhek to reinforce local Royal Lao Police (PRL) and RLA infantry units in an unsuccessful attempt to quell pro-communist demonstrations. By May 1975 the 7th Para Brigade was disbanded after Pathet Lao guerrilla forces took control of Vientiane.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 19. ==Weapons and equipment== The SPECOM used the standard weaponry and equipment of US origin issued to FAR units, complemented by captured Soviet or Chinese small-arms such as AK-47 assault rifles that allowed its personnel to use ammunition retrieved from enemy caches while on operations. The unit also fielded crew-served heavy weapons, such as mortars and recoilless rifles. * Smith & Wesson Model 10 Revolver * Colt.45 M1911A1 Pistol * Smith & Wesson Model 39 Pistol * TT-33 Pistol * Type 56 assault rifle * Type 56-1 Assault rifle * AKM Assault rifle * M16A1 Assault rifleConboy and Greer, War in Laos 1954–1975 (1994), p. 59. * CAR-15 Assault carbine * RPD Light machine gun * Type 56 Light machine gun * M1918A2 BAR Light machine gun * M60 Light machine gunConboy and Greer, War in Laos 1954–1975 (1994), p. 59. * M72 LAW Anti-tank rocket launcher * M79 grenade launcher * XM148 grenade launcherConboy and Greer, War in Laos 1954–1975 (1994), p. 59. * M203 grenade launcher * Browning M1919A4 .30 Cal Medium machine gun * Browning M2HB .50 Cal Heavy machine gun * M2 4.2 inch mortar 107 mm * M67 recoilless rifle 90 mm * M18 Claymore anti-personnel mines ==See also== * Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces (LLDB) * Air America (airline) * Commando Raider Teams * Directorate of National Coordination * Laotian Civil War * Lao People's Armed Forces * Khmer Special Forces * Military Region 5 Commandos * Pathet Lao * Royal Lao Armed Forces * Royal Lao Army Airborne * Royal Lao Police * Special Guerrilla Units (SGU) * Vietnam War * Weapons of the Laotian Civil War ==EndnotesReferences== *Kenneth Conboy and Don Greer, War in Laos 1954–1975, Carrollton, TX: Squadron/Signal Publications, 1994. *Kenneth Conboy and Simon McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960–75, Men-at-arms series 217, Osprey Publishing Ltd, London 1989. *Kenneth Conboy and Simon McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces, Elite series 33, Osprey Publishing Ltd, London 1991. * Kenneth Conboy with James Morrison, Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos, Boulder CO: Paladin Press, 1995. , 1581605358 ===Further reading=== *Gordon L.

After racing over sprint distances, she was stepped up in distance the substitute \\"New Oaks\\" over one and a half miles at Newmarket Racecourse. On her next appearance she won the Falmouth Stakes and was then retired from racing. She later became a very successful broodmare. ==Background== Commotion was a bay filly bred in England by John Arthur Dewar who had inherited his Thoroughbred racehorses from his uncle the Scottish whisky distiller Thomas Dewar, 1st Baron Dewar. She was from the first crop of foals sired by the French stallion Mieuxce, who won the Prix du Jockey Club and the Grand Prix de Paris before his racing career was ended by injury. Commotion's dam Riot was a half-sister to both Sansonnet (who produced Tudor Minstrel) and Fair Trial as well as being a high-class racehorse in her own right, winning the July Stakes in 1931. Commotion was sent into training with Fred Darling at Beckhampton, Wiltshire. Commotion's racing career took place during World War II during which horse racing in Britain was subject to many restrictions. Several major racecourses, including Epsom and Doncaster, were closed for the duration of the conflict, either for safety reasons, or because they were being used by the military. Many important races were rescheduled to new dates and venues, often at short notice, and all five of the Classics were usually run at Newmarket. Wartime austerity also meant that prize money was reduced: Commotion's Oaks was worth £1,939 compared to the £8,043 earned by Galatea in 1939. ==Racing career== With Epsom Racecourse unavailable in 1941, a substitute \\"New Oaks\\" was run over one and a half miles on the July course at Newmarket Racecourse on 19 June. Commotion was well-backed for the race despite never previously having raced beyond six furlongs. Ridden by Harry Wragg, she started at odds of 8/1 with the 1000 Guineas winner Dancing Time starting odds-on favourite. Wragg, who was a specialist at waiting tactics, restrained the filly in the early stages before producing her with a strong late run. She \\"threaded her way through the field\\" to take the lead in the final furlong and won by two lengths from Turkana, with Dancing Time three- quarters of a length away in third. Following the Derby victory of Owen Tudor, owned by a member of the Buchanan family, Commotion's success completed what was dubbed a \\"whisky double\\". At Newmarket in July Commotion started 6/5 favourite for the Falmouth Stakes which was run as part of a substitute Royal Ascot meeting. She won narrowly from 1000 Guineas runner-up Beausite with Turkana third. ==Assessment== At the end of 1941, Commotion was rated the best three-year-old filly in Britain, three pounds ahead of Dancing Time. In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Commotion an \\"average\\" winner of the Oaks. ==Breeding record== Commotion produced eight winners between 1943 and 1958 including three top-class performers before her death in 1960: *Combat, a brown colt, foaled in 1944, sired by Big Game. Undefeated winner of nine races including the Sussex Stakes. *Faux Tirage, bay colt, 1946, by Big Game. Won Newmarket Stakes, St James's Palace Stakes *Aristophanes, chestnut colt, 1948, by Hyperion.

As of the 2019-2020 school year, 1213 students were enrolled. A.N. Myer is known for its Triple A highschool status as it has many high achievements in Academics, The Arts, and Athletics. The athletic department often is in local spotlight, as many OFSAA and SOSSA medals were achieved by athletes under the Marauder Flag. A. N. Myer was one of the first schools in the Niagara Region to receive an astroturf field in recent years. It is the only high school in the city of Niagara Falls to offer the french immersion program. ==History== A.N. Myer was named after Andrew Nicholas Myer, who was principal of Stamford Collegiate from 1908 to 1933. He lived in Chippawa, near Niagara, until his death in 1963. AN Myer Secondary School officially opened its doors on September the 3rd 1957. An official opening ceremony was held nearly 2 months later on October the 25th 1957. ==Curling== The A. N. Myer Boys' curling team in 2016-2017 consisted of Tyler Mills, Nicholas Vadacchino, Michael \\"Danger\\" Huang, Sourena Noori, and Victor Pietrangelo. The team went undefeated in their journey to OFSAA, held in North Bay, Ontario, before winning every single game there. ==Football== From 2014 to 2016, the senior boys football team won 3 straight OFSAA championships. Along with the OFSAA championship in 2016, the team also finished the season ranked 2nd in Canada, and finished those past 3 seasons with a combined record of 24-1. The Junior team has also enjoyed major success over the past several years, and as the case with the seniors as well, have won multiple zone and divisional (Niagara Bowl) titles. Although one of the most notable successes was in 2013, when they won the Junior Metrobowl. The seniors have made dominant runs to the past 3 Niagara Bowls (public school board champion vs catholic school board champion), but they've come up short in all 3 finals. 2 at the hands of Notre Dame College School in 2017 and 2019, and 1 at the hands of St Paul Catholic High School in 2018. Those 3 teams would all end up making runs to OFSAA. The juniors have also made recent runs to the Niagara bowl in 2017 and 2018. They came up short in 2018 to Notre Dame College School, but in 2017 they defeated Blessed Trinity Catholic Secondary School, and ended up advancing all the way to the Junior Metrobowl semifinals, where they came up short to Lorne Park Secondary School. ==Notable alumni== *John MacBain, finance mogul and philanthropist *Jay Triano, former Canadian professional basketball player who competed in 2 Olympics under the Canadian flag and has served as the head coach twice.

The microbes can engage in a commensal, mutualistic or pathogenic interaction with the host. These include bacterial, viral, unicellular eukaryotic, and fungal interactions. In nature C. elegans harbours a variety of different microbes. In contrast, C. elegans strains that are cultivated in laboratories for research purposes have lost the natural associated microbial communities and are commonly maintained on a single bacterial strain, Escherichia coli OP50. However, E. coli OP50 does not allow for reverse genetic screens because RNAi libraries have only been generated in strain HT115. This limits the ability to study bacterial effects on host phenotypes. The host microbe interactions of C. elegans are closely studied because of their orthologs in humans. Therefore, the better we understand the host interactions of C. elegans the better we can understand the host interactions within the human body. == Natural ecology == Imbalance between our knowledge of C. elegans biology gained by laboratory discoveries versus C. elegans natural ecology C. elegans is a well-established model organism in different research fields, yet its ecology however is only poorly understood. They have a short development cycle only lasting three days with a total life span of about two weeks.C. elegans were previously considered a soil-living nematode, but in the last 10 years it was shown that natural habitats of C. elegans are microbe-rich, such as compost heaps, rotten plant material, and rotten fruits. Most of the studies on C. elegans are based on the N2 strain, which has adapted to laboratory conditions. Only in the last few years the natural ecology of C. elegans has been studied in more detail and one current research focus is its interaction with microbes. As C. elegans feeds on bacteria (microbivory), the intestine of worms isolated from the wild is usually filled with a large number of bacteria. In contrast to the very high diversity of bacteria in the natural habitat of C. elegans, the lab strains are only fed with one bacterial strain, the Escherichia coli derivate OP50 . OP50 was not co-isolated with C. elegans from nature, but was rather used because of its high convenience for laboratory maintenance. Bleaching is a common method in the laboratory to clean C. elegans of contaminations and to synchronize a population of worms. During bleaching the worms are treated with 5N NaOH and household bleach, leading to the death of all worms and survival of only the nematode eggs. The larvae hatching from these eggs lack any microbes, as none of the currently known C. elegans-associated microbes can be transferred vertically. Since most laboratory strains are kept under these gnotobiotic conditions, nothing is known about the composition of the C. elegans microbiota. The ecology of C. elegans can only be fully understood in the light of the multiple interactions with the microorganisms, which it encounters in the wild. The effect of microbes on C. elegans can vary from beneficial to lethal. ==Beneficial microbes == In its natural habitat C. elegans is constantly confronted with a variety of bacteria that could have both negative and positive effects on its fitness. To date, most research on C. elegans-microbe interactions focused on interactions with pathogens. Only recently, some studies addressed the role of commensal and mutualistic bacteria on C. elegans fitness. In these studies, C. elegans was exposed to various soil bacteria, either isolated in a different context or from C. elegans lab strains transferred to soil. These bacteria can affect C. elegans either directly through specific metabolites, or they can cause a change in the environmental conditions and thus induce a physiological response in the host. Beneficial bacteria can have a positive effect on the lifespan, generate certain pathogen resistances, or influence the development of C. elegans. === Lifespan extension === Pseudomonas The lifespan of C. elegans is prolonged when grown on plates with Pseudomonas sp. or Bacillus megaterium compared to individuals living on E.coli. The lifespan extension mediated by B. megaterium is greater than that caused by Pseudomonas sp.. As determined by microarray analysis (a method, which allows the identification of C. elegans genes that are differentially expressed in response to different bacteria), 14 immune defence genes were up-regulated when C. elegans was grown on B. megaterium, while only two were up-regulated when fed with Pseudomonas sp. In addition to immune defence genes, other upregulated genes are involved in the synthesis of collagen and other cuticle components, indicating that the cuticle might play an important role in the interaction with microbes. Although some of the genes are known to be important for C. elegans lifespan extension, the precise underlying mechanisms still remain unclear. ===Protection against microbes === The microbial communities residing inside the host body have now been recognized to be important for effective immune responses. Yet the molecular mechanisms underlying this protection are largely unknown. Bacteria can help the host to fight against pathogens either by directly stimulating the immune response or by competing with the pathogenic bacteria for available resources. In C. elegans, some associated bacteria seem to generate protection against pathogens. For example, when C. elegans is grown on Bacillus megaterium or Pseudomonas mendocina, worms are more resistant to infection with the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa [21], which is a common bacterium in C. elegans’ natural environment and therefore a potential natural pathogen. This protection is characterized by prolonged survival on P. aeruginosa in combination with a delayed colonization of C. elegans by the pathogen. Due to its comparatively large size B. megaterium is not an optimal food source for C. elegans, resulting in a delayed development and a reduced reproductive rate. The ability of B. megaterium to enhance resistance against the infection with P. aeruginosa seems to be linked to the decrease in reproductive rate. However, the protection against P. aeruginosa infection provided by P. mendocina is reproduction independent, and depends on the p38 mitogen- activated protein kinase pathway. P. mendocina is able to activate the p38 MAPK pathway and thus to stimulate the immune response of C. elegans against the pathogen. A common way for an organism to protect itself against microbes is to increase fecundation to increase the surviving individuals in the face of an attack. This defense against parasites are genetically linked to stress response pathways and dependent on the innate immune system. === Effects on development === Caenorhabditis elegans late embryonic development Under natural conditions it might be advantageous for C. elegans to develop as fast as possible to be able to reproduce rapidly. The bacterium Comamonas DA1877 accelerates the development of C. elegans. Neither TOR (target of rapamycin), nor insulin signalling seem to mediate this effect on the accelerated development. It is thus possible that secreted metabolites of Comamonas, which might be sensed by C. elegans, lead to faster development. Worms that were fed with Comamonas DA1877 also showed a reduced number of offspring and a reduced lifespan. Another microbe that accelerates C. elegans' growth are L . sphaericus. This bacteria significantly increased the growth rate of C. elegans when compared to their normal diet of E. coli OP50. C. elegans are mostly grown and observed in a controlled laboratory with a controlled diet, therefore, they may show differential growth rates with naturally occurring microbes. == Pathogenic microbes == In its natural environment C. elegans is confronted with a variety of different potential pathogens. C. elegans has been used intensively as a model organism for studying host-pathogen interactions and the immune system. These studies revealed that C. elegans has well-functioning innate immune defenses. The first line of defense is the extremely tough cuticle that provides an external barrier against pathogen invasion. In addition, several conserved signaling pathways contribute to defense, including the DAF-2/DAF-16 insulin-like receptor pathway and several MAP kinase pathways, which activate physiological immune responses. Finally, pathogen avoidance behavior represents another line of C. elegans immune defense. All these defense mechanisms do not work independently, but jointly to ensure an optimal defense response against pathogens. Many microorganisms were found to be pathogenic for C. elegans under laboratory conditions. To identify potential C. elegans pathogens, worms in the L4 larval stage are transferred to a medium that contains the organism of interest, which is a bacterium in most cases. Pathogenicity of the organism can be inferred by measuring the lifespan of worms. There are several known human pathogens that have a negative effect on C. elegans survival. However, only very few natural C. elegans pathogens are currently known. === Eukaryotic microbes === One of the best studied natural pathogens of C. elegans is the microsporidium Nematocida parisii, which was directly isolated from wild-caught C. elegans. N. parisii is an intracellular parasite that is exclusively transmitted horizontally from one animal to another. The microsporidian spores are likely to exit the cells by disrupting a conserved cytoskeletal structure in the intestine called the terminal web. It seems that none of the known immune pathways of C. elegans is involved in mediating resistance against N. parisii. Microsporidia were found in several nematodes isolated from different locations, indicating that microsporidia are common natural parasites of C. elegans. The N. parisii-C. elegans system represents a very useful tool to study infection mechanisms of intracellular parasites. Additionally, a new species of microsporidia was recently found in a wild caught C. elegans that genome sequencing places in the same genus Nematocida as prior microsporidia seen in these nematodes. This new species was named Nematocida displodere, after a phenotype seen in late infected worms that explode at the vulva to release infectious spores. N. displodere was shown to infect a broad range of tissues and cell types in C. elegans, including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, intestine, seam cells, and coelomocytes. Strangely, the majority of intestinal infection fails to grow to later parasite stages, while the muscle and epidermal infection thrives. This is in stark contrast to N. parisii which infects and completes its entire life cycle in the C. elegans intestine. These related Nematocida species are being used to study the host and pathogen mechanisms responsible for allowing or blocking eukaryotic parasite growth in different tissue niches. Another eukaryotic pathogen is the fungus Drechmeria coniospora, which has not been directly co-isolated with C. elegans from nature, but is still considered to be a natural pathogen of C. elegans. D. coniospora attaches to the cuticle of the worm at the vulva, mouth, and anus and its hyphae penetrate the cuticle. In this way D. coniospora infects the worm from the outside, while the majority of bacterial pathogens infect the worm from the intestinal lumen. === Viral pathogens === In 2011 the first naturally associated virus was isolated from C. elegans found outside of a laboratory. The Orsay virus is an RNA virus that is closely related to nodaviruses. The virus is not stably integrated into the host genome. It is transmitted horizontally under laboratory conditions. An antiviral RNAi pathway is essential for C. elegans resistance against Orsay virus infection. To date there has not been a virus, other intracellular pathogens, or multicellular parasite that have been able to affect the nematode. Because of this we cannot use C. elegans as an experimental system for these interactions. In 2005, two reports have shown that vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), an arbovirus with a many invertebrate and vertebrate host range, could replicate in primary cells derived from C. elegans embryos. === Bacterial pathogens === Caenorhabditis elegans intestine infected with Bacillus thuringiensis Two bacterial strains of the genus Leucobacter were co-isolated from nature with the two Caenorhabditis species C. briggsae and C. n. spp 11, and named Verde 1 and Verde 2. These two Leucobacter strains showed contrasting pathogenic effects in C. elegans. Worms that were infected with Verde 2 produced a deformed anal region (“Dar” phenotype), while infections with Verde 1 resulted in slower growth due to coating of the cuticle with the bacterial strain. In liquid culture Verde 1 infected worms stuck together with their tails and formed so called “worm stars”. The trapped worms cannot free themselves and eventually die. After death C. elegans is then used as a food source for the bacteria. Only larvae in the L4 stage seem to be able to escape by autotomy. They split their bodies into half, so that the anterior half can escape. The “half-worms” remain viable for several days. The Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis is likely associated with C. elegans in nature. B. thuringiensis is a soil bacterium that is often used in infection experiments with C. elegans. It produces spore-forming toxins, called crystal (Cry) toxins, which are associated with spores. These are jointly taken up by C. elegans orally. Inside the host, the toxins bind to the surface of intestinal cells, where the formation of pores in intestinal cells is induced, causing their destruction. The resulting change in milieu in the gut leads to germination of the spores, which subsequently proliferate in the worm body. An aspect of the C. elegans–B. thuringiensis system is the high variability in pathogenicity between different strains. There are highly pathogenic strains, but also strains that are less or even non-pathogenic. == See also == *Caenorhabditis elegans * Gnotobiosis * Microbiome in the Drosophila gut * Microbiota ==References Further reading == * Frézal, L., Félix, MA., C. elegans outside the Petri dish (http://lens.elifesciences.org/05849/) * * Petersen C., Dirksen P., Schulenburg H., Why we need more ecology for genetic models like C. elegans(http://www.cell.com/trends/genetics/abstract/S0168-9525%2814%2900198-X) == External links == * The Wormbase * Wormatlas (A database of behavioral and structural anatomy of Caenorhabditis elegans) * WormBook (The online review of C. elegans biology) Category:Caenorhabditis elegans Category:Microbiology ","title":"Host microbe interactions in Caenorhabditis elegans"},{"id":"46837972","text":"Boltonia montana (mountain doll's daisy), is a North American species of plants in the sunflower family.

Doc., Vicar of St. Oswald's, Durham (London: John Murray, Albemarle Street, 1897), p. 103. After education at home he studied from 1846 to 1848 at St. Bees Theological College (closed in 1896). Ordained deacon in 1848 and priest in 1849 by the Bishop of Manchester, he first served as curate at St. Stephen's, Salford. In 1850 he removed to Wigan, where his work among the Lancashire colliers came to the notice of the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres, who made him his domestic chaplain. After acting as clerk in orders of Manchester Cathedral from 1855 to 1863, and receiving the Lambeth degree of M.A. in 1855, he became rector of St. Stephen's, Salford, in 1863. Huntington was active in Manchester during the cotton famine, and his 'Church's Work in our Large Towns' (1863) gave him a high reputation. On 6 January 1867 he was inducted into the crown rectory of Tenby, in Pembrokeshire, where he remained until his death at Bath on 8 April 1905. He was buried at Tenby. Huntington was an earnest high churchman, and at first came into conflict with evangelical sentiment in Tenby. A mission conducted there in 1877 by ritualist clergy under Huntington's auspices led to controversy in which William Basil Jones, Bishop of St. David's, took part (cf. Three Letters on the Subject of the Late Tenby Mission 1877). But the hostility gradually disappeared, and Huntington was able to restore and beautify his church, with the active support of his parishioners. He was an impressive preacher, at once practical and somewhat mystical. He was also a governor of the county school, chairman of the managers of the parish schools, and an energetic freemason. Besides the work mentioned, Huntington published sermons, addresses, articles in magazines, and three volumes exhibiting some power in describing character, viz. 'Autobiography of John Brown, Cordwainer' (1867), of which he represented himself as editor and which went into five editions; the 'Autobiography of an Alms-Bag' (1885) which depicts some local figures, and his 'Random Recollections' (1895) which contains attractive sketches of friends and neighbours. ==Family== Huntington married on 26 April 1849 Charlotte Elizabeth, daughter of John Henry Garton of Hull, who survived him. By her he had issue, five daughters and two sons. ==NotesReferences== * Endnotes ** The Times, 14 April 1905; ** Church Times, 14 April 1905; **obituary by J.

The standard example is etching of silicon by alternating reaction with chlorine and etching with argon ions. This is a better- controlled process than reactive ion etching, though the issue with commercial use of it has been throughput; sophisticated gas handling is required, and removal rates of one atomic layer per second are around the state of the art. The equivalent process for depositing material is atomic layer deposition (ALD). ALD is substantially more mature, having been used by Intel for high-κ dielectric layers since 2007 and in Finland in the fabrication of thin film electroluminescent devices since 1985. == References  External links == * ECS-JSS focus journal on atomic layer etch *Overview of atomic layer etching in the semiconductor industry Category:Industrial processes Category:Chemical processes Category:Semiconductor device fabrication Category:Etching (microfabrication) ","title":"Atomic layer etching"},{"id":"46838153","text":"The surname Krehbiel may refer to: *Henry Edward Krehbiel (1854–1923), American musicologist *Albert Henry Krehbiel (1873-1945), American painter *Fern Krehbiel (1888-1981), American actress whose stage name was Ruth Maycliffe *John Krehbiel, Jr. (b. 1938), American businessman Category:Surnames ","title":"Krehbiel"},{"id":"46838196","text":"Oresas was a Pythagorean, according to Sir William Smith, (1870).

Based in Brooklyn, New York, Villalongo is an assistant professor at the Cooper Union School of Art in New York. ==Early life and education== Villalongo was born in Hollywood, Florida, to a Puerto Rican father and African-American mother. His parents separated when he was a young child and he was raised in Bridgeton, New Jersey. Villalongo received his Bachelor of Fine Arts from The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in 1999. He furthered his education by receiving his Masters of Fine Art from the Tyler School of Art at Temple University in 2001. ==Influences== Villallongo’s work typically focuses on the politics of historical erasure, with a particular focus on the artistic reassessment of Western, American, and African Art histories. The artist states that his intention toward these reassessments evolves in part from the West's histories of \\"taking African art objects and placing them on the side of the sofa to decorate, although that is not their purpose. We are obsessed with fitting a narrative, a story.\\" His work engages with the black body, examining the influence of socialization, history, dress and speech. Commenting on his reexamination of the power dynamics of history and representation, Villalongo has posited, \\"[The relationship is] problematic and interesting, and I wanted to think about how to use it and tell a story.\\" In many of the artist's portraits, bodies emerge from \\"a tumult of white negative space cut out of black velour paper,\\" in ways that evoke leaves, branches, feathers, or slashes. == Professional career == Villalongo has exhibited throughout the United States. His solo exhibitions include the University of Connecticut Contemporary Art Galleries; Rosenwald-Wolf Gallery at University of the Arts Philadelphia; Scarfone-Hartley Gallery at the University of Tampa, Florida, and the Harvey B. Gantt Center for African-American Arts and Culture in Charlotte, North Carolina. His work was included in a major gift to the permanent collection of the Studio Museum in Harlem in 2018 by collector Peggy Cooper Cafritz. Villalongo is one of 42 artists who contributed works to a record-setting Sotheby's auction in support of the construction of a new building for the Studio Museum, to be located on 125th Street. His work has been featured in group exhibitions at El Museo del Barrio in New York City; the Weatherspoon Art Museum in Greensboro, North Carolina; the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland; and, Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts, New York City. The artist’s work can be found in collections of the Baltimore Museum of Art; Denver Art Museum; Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts; Princeton University Art Museum; Rose Art Museum, Brandeis University; Studio Museum in Harlem, NYC; Toledo Museum of Art; Weatherspoon Museum of Art, Greensboro; Whitney Museum of American Art; and the Yale University Art Gallery among others. He has also had work published in ESOPUS 22. Villalongo has completed residencies at Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture; The Studio Museum in Harlem, New York; Studio-f at the University of Tampa, Florida; the Hermitage Artist Retreat; and, the Fountainhead in Miami, Florida. He is represented by Susan Inglett Gallery, New York. === Curatorial work: Black Pulp! === In 2016, Villalongo co-curated Black Pulp!, a traveling exhibition of nearly a century's worth of Black image production by Black publishers, Black artists and by non-Black artists, with fellow artist Mark Thomas Gibson. The exhibition was named for pulp, a cheap paper that was used to inexpensively print newspapers, books, leaflets, and other printed ephemera in the 19th and 20th centuries and consequently made mass communication possible. During these centuries, the images of African-Americans that appeared in pulp publications produced and distributed by white Americans were often racist. As a consequence, \\"black pulp\\" was used by black communities to combat these racist portrayals and to facilitate communication within and about black identity. Black Pulp! presented black pulp media from the Harlem Renaissance and its succeeding decades that offered up \\"windows into the darker, erotic, satirical, and more absurd recesses of the Black popular imagination; while underscoring important debates around personhood and identity.\\" The collection of works, wrote William Villalongo in the exhibition's catalogue, \\"highlight[ed] historical efforts within the medium to rebuff derogatory image culture with exceptional wit, beauty, and humor, to provide emerging, nuanced perspective on black humanity.\\" In a 2016 interview for The Huffington Post, Villalongo expressed his hope that the exhibition would allow people to \\"see an expanded view of the Black subject in general, but also the complex and immense challenge of historical efforts of Black folk to own and steward their own image.\\" A large portion of the historical works and print media displayed in the exhibition came from collections at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, the Library of Congress, the Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library at Emory University, EBay, and the personal collections of Villalongo and Gibson.

The church is theologically diverse and maintains a lively range of traditions within its services. It is the Church of England parish church for Cambourne. The local Roman Catholic community called Saint John Fisher Churchhttp://cambournerc.com/ also worships within the church centre. ==History== Cambourne is a growing community nine miles west of Cambridge, designed as a series of three interlinked villages. Cambourne Church started meeting shortly after the first residents arrived in 1999, the first minister, Rev Peter Wood, was appointed in 2001. The church has grown steadily with the community, playing an instrumental role from its very beginning. It is a lively ecumenical partnership sponsored by the Church of England, the Baptist Union, the Methodist Church and the United Reformed Church, and in association with the Roman Catholic Church. The church building is on the corner of Jeavons Lane. ==The present== In 2014, Rev Matthew Trick, was appointed. He was supported by the Rev Lynda Taylor, who joined in 2013. Cambourne Church is now in a period of ministerial vacancy following Rev Matthew Trick moving away from Cambourne in September 2017.

At present the church offers two services on a Sunday morning at 9:30 am (more traditional) and 11 am (contemporary). Groups for children and young people meet during the 11 am service. The church currently operates a community café (19 ~ The Coffee House). ==Governance== The church land and buildings are owned by Shared Churches Ely, which is formed by representatives of the partner denominations. There is also a \\"Local Advisory Group\\", also made up of members of the partner denominations, which advises the Minister with regards to the direction of ministry at the Church.

Previously known as National Division 3 South, it had been renamed due to widespread changes to the league system by the RFU with National One becoming the Championship, National 2 becoming National 1 and so on. The league system was 4 points for a win, 2 points for a draw and additional bonus points being awarded for scoring 4 or more tries and/or losing within 7 points of the victorious team. In terms of promotion the league champions would go straight up into National League 1 while the runners up would have a one-game playoff against the runners up from National League 2 North (at the home ground of the club with the superior league record) for the final promotion place. A further change to the league system would see the division increase from 14 to 15 teams (this was originally supposed to be 16 teams but one of the teams relegated from the 2008-09 National Division 2, Mounts Bay, folded at the beginning of the season). Barking would finish as champions with only two league defeats all season, while runners up Rosslyn Park would join them in the 2010–11 National League 1 by defeating 2009–10 National League 2 North runners up Loughborough Students in the National 2 promotion playoff. At the bottom of the table Bridgwater & Albion and newly promoted Barnes would be condemned to National League 3 South West and National League 3 London & SE respectively. ==Participating teams== Eleven of the teams listed below participated in the 2008-09 National League 3 South season; Westcombe Park were relegated from the 2008-09 National Division 2, while Clifton were promoted as champions of South West Division 1 with Shelford (champions) and Barnes (playoffs) coming up from London Division 1. { class=\\" sortable\\" - !width=25%Team !width=25%Stadium !width=25%Capacity !width=25%City/Area -  Barking  Goresbrook  1,000  Barking, London - Barnes Barn Elms  Barnes, London - Bridgwater & Albion Bath Road 5,000 Bridgwater, Somerset - Canterbury Merton Lane 1,075 (75 seats) Canterbury, Kent - Clifton Station Road 2,500 (400 seats) Clifton, Bristol - Dings Crusaders Landseer Avenue 1,500 Lockleaze, Bristol - Ealing Trailfinders Trailfinders Sports Ground 3,020 Ealing, London - Henley Hawks Dry Leas 4,000 Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire - Lydney Regentsholme 1,500 Lydney, Gloucestershire - Richmond Athletic Ground 4,500 Richmond, London - Rosslyn Park The Rock 2,000 Roehampton, London - Shelford The Davey Field 2,000 (150 seats) Great Shelford, Cambridgeshire - Southend Warners Bridge Park  Southend, Essex - Westcombe Park Goddington Dene 3,200 Orpington, London - Worthing Raiders Roundstone Lane 1,500 (100 seats) Angmering, West Sussex - } ==League table== { style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - colspan=\\"15\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\"2009–10 National League 2 South table - efefef;\\" width=\\"20\\" efefef;\\" width=\\"195\\"Club efefef;\\" width=\\"20\\"Played efefef;\\" width=\\"20\\"Won efefef;\\" width=\\"20\\"Drawn efefef;\\" width=\\"20\\"Lost efefef;\\" width=\\"20\\"Points For efefef;\\" width=\\"20\\"Points Against efefef;\\" width=\\"20\\"Points Difference efefef;\\" width=\\"20\\"Bonus Points efefef;\\" width=\\"60\\"Points -d8ffeb;text- align:center;\\"  1  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Barking (C)  28  26  0  2  1060  335  725  20  124 - ccccff;\\"  2  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Rosslyn Park (P)  28  23  1  4  995  423  572  19  113 -  3  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Ealing Trailfinders  28  22  1  5  1014  504  510  23  113 -  4  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Southend  28  19  1  8  802  566  236  17  95 -  5  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Clifton  28  18  2  8  682  571  111  15  91 -  6  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Worthing Raiders  28  16  1  11  653  561  92  9  75 -  7  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Canterbury  28  13  1  14  625  780  -155  13  67 -  8  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Richmond  28  11  0  17  706  761  -55  18  62 -  9  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Henley Hawks  28  11  1  16  668  598  70  10  56 -  10  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Shelford  27  11  1  15  550  778  -228  7  53 -  11  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Dings Crusaders  28  9  2  17  549  697  -148  13  53 -  12  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Lydney  28  8  0  20  580  807  -227  8  40 -  13  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Westcombe Park  27  8  0  19  434  832  -398  7  39 - ffcccc;\\"  14  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Barnes (R)  28  6  1  21  486  916  -430  5  31 - ffcccc;\\"  15  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Bridgwater & Albion (R)  28  2  0  26  321  996  -675  0  8 - colspan=\\"15\\" *If teams are level at any stage, tiebreakers are applied in the following order: # Number of matches won # Difference between points for and against # Total number of points for # Aggregate number of points scored in matches between tied teams # Number of matches won excluding the first match, then the second and so on until the tie is settled - colspan=\\"15\\" style=\\"border:0px\\" Green background is the promotion place.
