A half-forward flanker can be a forward such as John Barker, or it can be a midfielder such as Andrew McLeod, or Daniel Kerr. The centre half- forward is probably the most athletic player on the ground. He is required to kick goals, take strong marks, and do a lot of running. It is probably the most challenging position on the field, partly the reason key position players are so sought-after. Examples of centre half-forwards include Wayne Carey, Jonathan Brown, Warren Tredrea, Nick Riewoldt, Matthew Pavlich, Anthony Rocca, Barry Hall and Scott Lucas.

It was first synthesized in the laboratory of David E. Nichols. It has also been called 2C-CF3, a name derived from the Para-trifluoromethyl group it contains. ==Chemistry== 2C-TFM is a code that represents 4-trifluoromethyl-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine. The full name of the chemical is 2-[2,5-dimethoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]ethanamine. ==Dosage== A psychedelic dosage of 2C-TFM is reported to be 3-5 mg. ==Effects== Very little data exists, but some reports suggest 2C-TFM produces psychedelic (hallucinogenic/entheogenic) effects that last between 5-7 hours. It is considered to be the strongest 2C variation. ==Legality== 2C-TFM is unscheduled and uncontrolled in the United States, but possession and sales of 2C-TFM could potentially be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act because of its structural similarities to 2C-B and 2C-T-7. However, 2C-TFM, unlike many other phenethylamines, has not been widely sold by internet retailers. In the wake of Operation Web Tryp in July 2004, the issue of possession and sales of 2C-TFM and other similar chemicals will probably be resolved in the courtroom as well the fate of this rare but unique psychedelic. There have been no reported deaths or hospitalizations from 2C-TFM. ===Canada=== As of October 31st, 2016; 2C-TFM is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada. ==Pharmacology== The mechanism that produces the hallucinogenic and entheogenic effects of 2C-TFM is most likely to result from action as a 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonist in the brain, a mechanism of action shared by all of the hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines. 2C-TFM displaced radiolabelled ketanserin from 5-HT2A/C receptors with a Ki of 74.5nM, as compared to a Ki of 80.9nM for the more well known 5-HT2A agonist DOI, indicating similar binding affinity at the receptor. The high binding affinity conferred by the 4-trifluoromethyl group is demonstrated by the fact that 2C-TFM is one of the only simple phenethylamines to rival the potency of psychedelic amphetamines like DOI and DOB, in both in vitro studies and human trials. ==Dangers== The toxicity of 2C-TFM is not known. ==Synthesis== It is noted in The Shulgin Index Volume 1: Psychedelic Phenethylamines and Related Compounds where the synthesis is written \\"from 2C-I (with trifluoroacetic anhydride) to 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-(trifluoroacetamido)ethane; (with methyl chlorodifluoroacetate, KF, Cul) to 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-2-(trifluoroacetamido)ethane; (with KOH) to 2C-TFM.\\" The synthesis was published by Nichols and his research team. ==References== Category:2C (psychedelics) Category:Trifluoromethyl compounds Category:Phenethylamines ","title":"2C-TFM"},{"id":"3252135","text":"List of prominent members of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party Members of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP), a marxist, trotskyist, socialist party in Sri Lanka.

When Vyankoji (Ekoji) refuses to share father's property with Shivaji then war starts between them and then Hambirrao won major provinces of Vyankoji such as Jagdevagad, Kaveripattam, Chidambaram, and Vriddhachalam. Vyankoji was very upset that Shivaji captured his states. On 6 November 1677, the battle started in Vyankoji and Hambirrao. Vyankoji won in battle, but later Hambirrao suddenly attacked Vyankoji's army and won the defeated battle. After two months Shivaji's intervention ended the fight. Hambirrao won the important fort of Vellore on 22 July 1678 from Adilshahi general Abdullakhan. == Role of Hambirrao in coronation of Sambhaji == Shivaji died on 3 April 1680. On 21 April, the corrupt ministers of Swarajya crowned Rajaram. At that time Rajaram was only ten years old. Rajaram was the nephew of Hambirrao. The ministers of Swarajya ordered Sambhaji to be imprisoned. When Hambirrao came to know about this, Hambirrao captured all the ministers and presented them to Sambhaji. This shows how deep Hambirao's undying loyalty to Swarajya was. == Attack on Burhanpur == Burhanpur was a major trade center connecting southern and northern India. There were a total of 17 trade centers in Burhanpur. On 30 January 1681, commanders Hambirrao Mohite and Sambhaji suddenly attacked Burhanpur. At that time the Subedar of Burhanpur was Khanjahan. For the protection of Burhanpur there was only an army of 200 and Hambirrao had an army of 20,000. The Mughals did not even have the strength to oppose Hambir Rao's army. The Marathas looted all the trade centers of Burhanpur for three days. Marathas got assets worth more than 1 crore hons in this battle. On 17 March 1683, Hambirrao defeated Ranamast khan, one of the most powerful chieftains of Aurangzeb, in Kalyan Bhiwandi. == Death == In 1687, in a battle fought near Wai province, Hambirrao defeated Rustumkhan, but a cannonball hit Hambir Rao, killing him. ==References== Book :- Senapati Hambirrao Mohite by Dr Sadashiv Shivde Category:People of the Maratha Empire ","title":"Hambirrao Mohite"},{"id":"3252204","text":"Mikhail Isaakovich Liber (5 June 1880 ‚Äì 4 October 1937), sometimes known as Mark Liber, was a leader of the General Jewish Workers' Union (the 'Bund'). He also played a role in the Russian Social-Democratic Workers' Party (RSDRP) and among the Mensheviks. Liber was instrumental in the soviets during the February Revolution of 1917 but opposed to October Revolution. He was reportedly shot during the Purges. Liber played a defining role in the development of the Bund and helped shaped the policies of the leaders of the February Revolution. ==Life and career== Mikhail Isaakovich Liber Mikhail Isaakovich Goldman was born in the Lithuanian city of Vilnius, then part of the Russian Empire, into a secular Jewish family. His father was a poet and office clerk. Like his older brothers, Boris and Lev (known as 'Gorev' and 'Akim' respectively), Mikhail became involved in radical student politics and was drawn to Marxism. He took an interest in the plight of Jewish workers in the Russian empire and joined the General Jewish Workers' Union in Lithuania, Poland and Russia (Algemeyner Yidisher Arbeter Bund in Lite, Poyln un Rusland, ◊ê÷∑◊ú◊í◊¢◊û◊≤÷∑◊†◊¢◊® ◊≤◊ì◊ô◊©◊¢◊® ◊ê÷∑◊®◊ë◊¢◊ò◊¢◊® ◊ë◊ï◊†◊ì ◊ê◊ô◊ü ◊ú◊ô◊ò◊¢ ◊§◊ï◊ô◊ú◊ô◊ü ◊ê◊ï◊ü ◊®◊ï◊°◊ú◊ê÷∑◊†◊ì) in 1897. Goldman took the revolutionary pseudonym 'M. Liber', by which he became known. He soon rose to prominence in the Bund and was elected to its Central Committee in 1902. The Bund competed, on the one hand, with non-Marxist Jewish socialist groups that were influenced by Russian populism and, on the other, with the emerging Jewish Zionist movement. The Bund rejected Jewish national separatism and eventually came out against the Zionist project of establishing a Jewish state in Palestine. The Bund stressed that the struggle for Jewish emancipation in the Russian empire must be linked with the struggle of the Russian proletariat, and for that reason sought close relations with Russian Social-Democracy. Nevertheless, the Bund insisted on the cultural autonomy of the empire's Jews and, accordingly, the organisational autonomy of the Bund within a federal Russian Social-Democratic party. In internal debates within the Bund, younger Bundists like Liber placed greater emphasis on Jewish cultural identity than their more assimilationist elders (such as the Bund's founder, Arkadi Kremer), and on the need for propaganda in Yiddish aimed specifically at Jewish workers. In relation to the RSDRP, they argued for a looser, federal form of organisation, rather than a unitary centralised one. Liber was one of the Bund's representatives at the fateful Second Congress of the RSDRP in 1903, and the third most frequent speaker at the congress (after Lenin and Trotsky). He defended the Bund's demand to be recognised as an autonomous organisation within the RSDRP and as the sole legitimate representative of the Jewish proletariat in the Russian empire. This position was roundly rejected by both Lenin and I.O. Martov, soon to emerge as the leaders of the Bolshevik and Menshevik factions of the RSDRP. Martov had himself been a member of the Bund in the 1890s and one of Liber's former collaborators, but at the second congress, he supported Lenin in demanding the integration of the Jewish proletariat in an All-Russian Social-Democratic party. Martov proposed a more liberal criterion of party membership than Lenin, but by the time that issue led to the schism between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, Liber and his fellow Bundist delegates had withdrawn in protest from the congress and from the RSDRP. It was the Bundists' exit that gave Lenin a slight majority at the congress (and hence enabled him to call his faction 'Bolshevik' - 'Majoritarian'). As the division between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks hardened, the Bund was increasingly drawn to the Menshevik side. The Mensheviks reversed their position on organisational federalism, making it possible for the Bund to rejoin the Menshevik wing of the RSDRP. In 1906, Liber represented the Bund at the 4th, Unification, Congress of the RSDLP in Stockholm when the Bund rejoined the party. At the 5th Congress in London in 1907 he was elected to the RSDLP Central Committee. During the abortive Revolution of 1905, Liber played a role as a Bundist representative in the soviets, even though he, like most SDs (including Lenin), initially greeted the new, spontaneous workers' organisation with some scepticism. When the Revolution petered out in 1907 and the autocracy reasserted its authority, Liber was one of those who advocated a more cautious, legalistic course of action for the RSDRP. Known as 'Liquidators' because they wanted to 'liquidate' the illegal underground organisation of the party, this group was fiercely opposed by Lenin as well as by 'Party Mensheviks' like Martov and Trotsky (then a Menshevik). However, Social-Democratic 'Liquidators' like Liber had counterparts among the Socialist-Revolutionaries, including Liber's contemporary A.R. Gots. Liber's subsequent close alignment with Gots in 1917 may have had its roots in their common 'Liquidationism' of the 1910s. During this period, Liber married, which may also have encouraged his emphasis on legal work. In 1914, Liber at first opposed the First World War and took a moderate 'Internationalist' position. However, after the February Revolution of 1917, Liber called for war 'in defence of the revolution' and took up a 'Revolutionary Defencist' position. As a representative of the Bund and the Mensheviks, Liber played a major role in the soviets. He collaborated closely with Menshevik and SR 'Revolutionary Defencists' like F.I. Dan, I.G. Tsereteli, A.R. Gots, V.M. Zenzinov and N.D. Avksentiev - so closely that his name was often linked in Bolshevik propaganda with those of Dan and Gots, in a pun on the German phrase Dann lieber Gott! ('then, dear God!), as Danlibergots. Liber was a staunch supporter of Alexander Kerensky's Provisional Government, although he declined an offer to join the cabinet, preferring to concentrate on his work in the soviet. He represented the Bund in the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet and was a member of the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the All-Russian Soviet. As such, Liber opposed not only the Bolsheviks but also Menshevik Internationalists like his old comrade Martov. Liber opposed the October Revolution of 1917 and rejected the position taken by the Mensheviks and many Bundists, which called for negotioation with the Bolsheviks for the purpose of forming an all-socialist coalition government. This proposal then had considerable support among Mensheviks, SRs and even some Bolsheviks (such as L.B. Kamenev), to Lenin's great annoyance. Nothing came of it beyond a brief cooperation of the Left SRs with the Bolsheviks. Liber, for opposite reasons, agreed with Lenin that a unity government uniting the Bolsheviks with the moderate socialists they had just overthrown was politically impossible and would destroy the revolution. In taking this view, Liber parted ways with Dan, who had gone over to Martov's Menshevik Internationalists and eventually migrated to the far left of the Menshevik party. Owing to his anti-Bolshevism, Liber lost his leadership positions in the Menshevik party and in the Bund, but found himself in agreement with anti-Bolshevik SRs like Gots and Avksentiev. Despite his fierce and public opposition to the Bolsheviks, Liber was not at first persecuted (perhaps because his brother-in-law was F.E. Dzerzhinky, first head of the Cheka). Liber spent most of the Civil War years in the Ukraine, returning to Moscow in 1920. He resumed work in the Menshevik party (which was abandoning hopes of co-operation with the Bolsheviks). In 1922 he protested against the death sentences passed against A.R. Gots and his co-defendants at the 'Trial of the Right SRs'. Shortly thereafter, Liber was himself arrested and sentenced to internal exile. It was the first of several arrests in the course of the next 15 years. His final arrest occurred in March 1937, at the height of the Purges. Reportedly he was shot in October of that year, together with Gots. However, Soviet sources deny this and claim that Gots lived until 1940, while Liber retired from politics, devoted himself to business and died of natural causes. ==References== *The Great Soviet Encyclopedia.

It was later ported to the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 consoles. Princess Holiday's story follows Cliff Cloud, who has to help the princess, Leticia La Mew Symphonia, stay undercover under the name Leticia Apple in his hometown. Princess Holiday enjoyed high sales, charting five times in the national sales ranking of bish≈çjo games. The gameplay follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the five female main characters by the player character. Princess Holiday has made transitions into other media, such as a light novel, art book, albums, and a 2-episode original video animation (OVA) series produced by Tadama Film. ==Gameplay== Average dialogue and narrative in Princess Holiday depicting Leticia (left) and Shilphy (right). Princess Holiday is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Cliff Cloud. Much of its gameplay is spent reading the text that appears on the screen, which represents the story's narrative and dialogue. The text is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Cliff is talking to, over background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. Princess Holiday follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. In the original Windows version, there are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. The DC version extend Diana's scenario, allowing players to try and win her over as well. Also, the port increases the number of endings to twelve, two for each heroine. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. Some decisions can lead the game to end prematurely and offer an alternative ending to the plot. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. In the Windows version, there are scenes depicting Cliff and a given heroine having sex.

Casota de Fre√°n, at Berdoias, Vimianzo. This was the first great culture to appear in Galicia, with a great capacity for construction and architecture. This was combined with a deep sense of religion, based on the cult of the dead, the mediators between man and the gods. Many historians believe that the Megalithic culture had two sources: an oriental source that was predominant in the Mediterranean area, and an Atlantic source, which originated north of the Tagus River. The latter, because of its geographical proximity to Galicia, would explain the abundant traces of megalithic culture in this area. As this was the first great culture, it was an important source of Galicia's cultural personality. From this era there remain thousands of dolmens (m√°moas), a type of tomb or sepulchre, throughout the entire territory. From its social organization it has been confirmed that it corresponded to some type of clan structure. === Bronze Age=== The introduction of bronze-working techniques introduced a new cultural era, in which the new importance of metals resulted in intense mining activity. Some historians attribute this to the extremely dry and warm climate of the time, resulting in erosion which revealed the rich mineral resources of the North. Peoples from the Castilian plateau moved to Galicia, thus increasing the population, because its position near the Atlantic Ocean gave it a very humid climate. The increase in population caused certain conflicts, but also led to increased mining and production of weapons, useful objects, and ornamental objects of gold and bronze. Pieces of jewellery crafted from Galician metals circulated throughout the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of Europe. ==Antiquity== ===The Gallaeci (Celts)=== The Palloza, a Galician house type still present in the eastern mountains of Galicia, was from the Iron Age until the Middle Ages common to the whole of Galicia. At the end of the Iron Age, people from northwestern Iberian Peninsula formed a homogeneous and distinct cultural group, which was later identified by early Greek and Latin authors, who called them \\"Gallaeci\\" (Galicians), perhaps due to their apparent similarity with the Galli (Gauls) and Gallati (Galatians). The Gallaeci were originally a Celtic people who for centuries had occupied the territory of modern Galicia and northern Portugal; bounded to the south by the Lusitanians and to the east by the Astures. In ethnic terms, they were the first Galicians (word derived from Gallaeci). The Gallaecians lived in fortified villages now called castros (Latin: castra): (hillforts), ranging from small villages of less than a hectare (more common in the north), to great hillforts with more than 10 hectares, named \\"Oppida\\" or \\"Cit√¢nia\\", which were more common in the southern half of the traditional settlement area. This mode of inhabiting the territory ‚Äì in hillforts ‚Äì was common throughout Europe during the Bronze and Iron Ages, having received in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula the name of \\"culture of hillforts\\" or \\"Castro Culture\\", what refers to this type of cultural manifestation before the arrival of the Roman Empire. However, even after the Roman's fall, the Gallaeci-Romans continued living in hillforts until the 8th century A.C. Only in the territory of actual Galicia exist more than two thousand hillforts, which shows the greatest dispersion of population from the Iron Age in Europe, and which would be the origin of the Galician occupation of the territory inherited until nowadays, characterized by small and high numerous populations so distant from each other. The Gallaeci's political organization was based on small independent states formed by a large number of hillforts; these states were headed by a local king whom the Romans called princeps, as in other parts of Europe. Each Gallaecian identified himself as a member of the hillfort where he lived, as well as the state / people to whom it belonged, and which the Romans called Populus. Among the Galleci there were many named tribes: the Artabri, the Bracari, the Coelerni, the Grovii, the Nemetati, etc. In the same way, at the end of the 18th century, Galicians identified themselves with their parish and their county. In religious terms, the Gallaeci showed a Celtic religion based on the cult to pan-Celtic gods as Bormanus, Coventina and Lugus; also Bandua, Cossus, Endovelicus, Reue, etc. ===Roman Gallaecia (19 BCE ‚Äì 410 AD)=== Roman Wall of Lugo (Galicia). The knowledge that we have today about the society of the hillforts is very limited; according to the Roman historians, the Galicians were a collection of barbarians who spent the day fighting and the night eating, drinking and dancing to the moon. But today it appears that in the last five centuries BCE they developed an aristocratic and even perhaps a feudal social model. The division of the country into concelhos, a concept similar to the counties of the islands or Romania, seems to be based on this class of social organization. Also, the structure based on hillforts seems to be associated with a fortified occupation of the territory, resembling the Central European classic Celtic habitat. On the other hand, this kind of territorial occupation was likely associated with its mineral resources (like a gold rush). It is also clear that the Romans' interest in this region was mainly related to its gold mines. When Iberia was involved in the Punic Wars between the Carthaginians and the Romans, the strategic alliance that they maintained with the Phoenicians enabled Hannibal to recruit many Gallegans. When the Romans finally undertook the conquest of Iberia, the Gallaicoi faced them in 137 BC. in the battle at the river Douro that resulted in a great Roman victory against 60,000 Galicians; the Roman general, proconsul Decimus Iunius Brutus, returned to Rome as a hero, receiving the additional name of Gallaicus, according to the historian Paulus Orosius. At the end of Brutus' campaigns, Rome controlled the territory between the Douro and Minho rivers plus probable extensions along the coast and in the interior. The Second Invasion, of 61 BCE, landed at Brigantium (A Coru√±a), under the command of Julius Caesar. The evidence suggests that the resistance of the Gaedels against the Romans ended here; from now on, they would be enlisted massively as auxiliaries of the Roman legions, fulfilling destinies sometimes completely separate from Galicia, as far as Thrace and Dacia. It has been estimated that of the total of Roman auxiliary troops coming from Iberia, more than a third belonged to tribes of the peninsular northwest. The final extinction of Celtic resistance was the aim of the violent and ruthless Cantabrian Wars fought under the emperor Octavian from 26 to 19 BCE. The resistance was appalling: collective suicide rather than surrender, mothers who killed their children before committing suicide, crucified prisoners of war who sang triumphant hymns, rebellions of captives who killed their guards and returned home from Gaul. In the 3rd century, Diocletian created an administrative division which included the convent≈´s (plural of conventus) of Gallaecia, Asturica and perhaps Cluniense. This province took the name of Gallaecia since Gallaecia was the most populous and important zone within the province. In 409, as Roman control collapsed, the conquests by the Suebi transformed Roman Gallaecia (convent≈´s Lucense and Bracarense) into the kingdom of Gallaecia (the Galliciense Regnum recorded by Hydatius and Gregory of Tours). ==Medieval Galicia== ===Suebic Kingdom of Galicia (410‚Äì585) === Golden Suevic coin made between years 410 and 500. In the year 411, Galicia fell to the Suebi, who formed a kingdom of their own. The number of the original Suebic invaders is estimated as fewer than 30,000 people, settled mainly in the urbanized zones of Braga (Bracara Augusta), Porto, Lugo (Lucus Augusta) and Astorga (Asturica Augusta). Bracara Augusta, the modern city of Braga, became the capital of the Suebi, as it was previously the capital of the Gallaecia Roman province. Suebic Gallaecia was larger than the modern region: it extended south to the river Douro and to √Åvila in the east. The Suebic kingdom in Gallaecia lasted from 410 to 584 and seems to have enjoyed relatively stable government for most of that time. Historians like Jos√© Ant√≥nio Lopes Silva, the translator of Idatius' chronicles, the primary written source for the 5th century, finds that the essential temper of Galician culture was established in the blending of Ibero-Roman culture with that of the Suebi. There were occasional clashes with the Visigoths, who arrived in the Iberian Peninsula in 416 and came to dominate most of the peninsula, but the Suebi maintained their independence until 584, when the Visigothic King Leovigild, invaded the Suebic kingdom and finally defeated it, bringing it under Visigoth control. Richard Fletcher (Fletcher 1984) points out that in Late Antiquity Galicia was still very much a part of the Roman and Mediterranean world. He instances the Galician nun Egeria's account of her pilgrimage to the Holy Land, 381-4 and the journey of the young Idatius, though living \\"at the uttermost limit of the world\\", who had met Jerome in the East; his chronicle shows that he remained aware of the affairs of the eastern Mediterranean and refers to travellers from the east coming to Galicia. As bishop Idatius travelled to Gaul on an embassy to Aetius, 431-2\\\\. Miro, king of the Suevi, had diplomatic relations with fellow barbarian kings in Neustria and Burgundy, but also with the emperors in Constantinople. Martin of Braga, a distinguished 6th century bishop, was a native of Pannonia. The Visigothic king Leovigild impounded the ships of Gaulish merchants in Galicia. At Lorenzana, the fine sarcophagus that received at a later date the mortal remains of count Osorio Guti√©rrez,was probably an import from southern Gaul in the 7th century, Fletcher notes. And one of the coins in the Bordeaux hoard deposited about 700 was struck at a Galician mint, suggesting possible trade connections. ===Arrival of the Britons and the founding of the diocese of Britonia=== Briton settlements in the 6th century. The political situation on the island of Britain (Britain) between the 4th and 7th centuries had completely changed with the abandonment of the island by Rome and the constant arrival of Anglo-Saxon tribes, from northern Germany and Denmark to the eastern part of Great Britain. The constant aggression and harassment that Jutes and Anglo-Saxons carried out against the native Britons caused some of them to emigrate by sea to other points near the Atlantic coast, settling in what is now northwest France Armorica (consequently, becoming known as Brittany) and in the north of the ancient Gallaecia. Nowadays, the cause of the displacement of some Britons to the north coast of Galicia and their reception by the Galician-Suevi remains unknown. Some authors suggest a possible military pact, or just acceptance by the native population. Organized in an important territory, introduced its own religious- Christian organization, actually bit different, and founded a bishopric itself that appears quoted in Parochiale Suevorum or Divisio Teodomiri, a document that shows the ecclesiastical organization of the kingdom of Galicia at the time of the monarchy sueva dated among 572 and 573. Its religious integration was complete, having watched his representative, ‚Äì called Maeloc ‚Äì to the Second Royal Council of Braga in 572. The ancient territory of the diocese of BritoniaKoch, John T. (2006). \\"Britonia\\". In John T. Koch, Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia. Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, p. 291. Most of what is known about the settlement comes from ecclesiastical sources; records from the 572 Second Council of Braga refer to a diocese called the Britonensis ecclesia (\\"British church\\") and an episcopal see called the sedes Britonarum (\\"See of the Britons\\"), which was likely the monastery of Santa Maria de Breto√±a. occupied mainly the coastal strip from the Lugo's coast to the Terra Ch√°, reaching his influence to the region of the Eo-Navia from the east and the west of Ferrol. Its ancient headquarters, known under the name Maximus Monastery was identified by some authors with the medieval Basilica of Saint Martin of Mondo√±edo, were remnants of 5th‚Äì6th centuries. Changed its name and its headquarters on several occasions, currently the Galician diocese of Mondo√±edo is its historical successor. The settlement of this wave of Britons immigrants and the creation of their Christian diocese is the second largest settlement of a foreign people in the lands of Galicia, after the Suevi. ===Visigothic Kingdom (585 ‚Äì 711)=== Visigothic Hispania and its regional divisions in 700, prior to the Muslim conquest. With the Catholicization of the Visigothic kings, the Catholic bishops increased in power, until, at the synod held at Toledo in 633, they took upon themselves the nobles' right to select a king from among the royal family. Rodrigo, the last elected king, was betrayed by Julian, count of Ceuta, who called for the Umayyad Muslims (or Moors) to enter Hispania. During the battle of Guadalete in 711, king Rodrigo lost his life. His left wing turned against him, as it was led by bishop Oppas, a collaborator with the Moors and a member of a rival royal faction. By the end of the battle the whole kingdom fell, and the throne was left empty, for the Moors did not allow the Oppas‚Äô faction to regain it. One of the few survivors was Pelayo, a noble in charge of the royal guard (Comes Spatharius). ===The kingdom of Asturias and Moorish Iberia=== This marked the beginning of the Muslim conquest of Hispania in which most of peninsula came under Islamic rule by 718. This rapid conquest can be understood as a continuation of the civil wars that had afflicted the peninsula for centuries, as well as the Moors following the Islamic command to gain converts by force. Pelayo is credited with beginning the Christian Reconquista of Iberia in 718, when he defeated the Umayyads in the Battle of Covadonga, and established the Kingdom of Asturias in the northern part of the peninsula. The north of Iberia (the former Kingdom of Gallaecia) was never put under real control and were not the most ideal place for the Moors, who just sent a military forces to collect taxes. But by the late 710‚Äôs Al-Andalus suffered of revolts. The Berbers did not like the lands they were given and were repressed by the emiral forces in several battles until the rebellion stopped, but then the Berbers turned against the Astures, claiming higher taxes and setting punishment patrols against their villages. This forced the Astures to start a guerrilla war. During the Moorish invasion of Spain, the Moors briefly occupied Galicia until they were driven out in 739 by Alfonso I of Asturias. The kingdom was known as Kingdom of Asturias until 924, when it became the Kingdom of Le√≥n. Moors regained southern part of Galicia in 953 and were finally driven out in 1034. === The discovery of the tomb of Saint James (813)=== Burgundian Statue 15th century, it represents the apostle Saint James, dressed as pilgrim. Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 813 the most important religious event of the medieval Christian Europe happened, the discovery in Galicia of an ark, which contained remains that were attributed to the apostle Saint James. According to Christian tradition, in this year, a hermit saw near to \\"Libredon\\" (ancient Santiago de Compostela) a star on a marble ark. Warned by him, the bishop of Iria Flavia, Teodomiro travelled quickly to the place, identifying the remains as found the decapitated body of the apostle James. Myth or reality, this \\"discovery\\" was quickly magnified by the Galician-Asturian monarch, Alphonse II (791‚Äì842), who in the same year ordered build a church around the tomb \\"holy\\", spreading the news throughout Christendom. The diocese of Iria and her owner, became the most powerful ecclesiastical administration not only of high-medieval Gallaecia, but the entire Iberian Peninsula, increasing its power with the constant royal donations to the church of Santiago de Compostela. Transformed into the third pilgrim centre of Christianity, ‚Äì just after Jerusalem and Rome ‚Äì was from the 11th and 12th centuries especially when from many parts of Europe began arriving pilgrims, both from Occitania, France, Navarra and Aragon-Catalonia (by land) and from the British Isles, Scandinavia, and German territories (by sea). The pilgrim phenomenon was decisive in the cultural and economic shaping of the kingdom of Galicia, developed mainly during Diego Gelmirez's mandate (1100‚Äì1136) who successfully converted Compostela in metropolitan church (year 1122), the most important Christian dignity in Occident after Rome. Around the Apostolic tomb grew not only a cathedral ‚Äì great center of artistic and religious life ‚Äì but a village then a town, strongly established in the Middle Ages, with a commercial derivative of its status as a holy city, where were crowned Galician kings, where grew the great Galician-Portuguese lyric school, and where is located the capital of Galicia since the Middle Ages. Historical and archaeological studies conducted in 20th century cathedral itself, revealed however, that during Gallaeci-Roman time and even during the Suevic period, Compostela was an important place where have buried important dignities ‚Äì civil or religious ‚Äì long before the year 813, which led to several specialists to defend that, the body attributed to the apostle Saint James was actually the body of Priscillian, patriarch of the Galicia church, beheaded at Trier in 385. ===Reconquista=== Iberian kingdoms c.925‚Äì929 During the 9th and 10th centuries, the counts of Galicia owed fluctuating obedience to their nominal sovereign, and Normans/Vikings occasionally raided the coasts. The Towers of Catoira See \\"Catoira History\\" (in Spanish)(Pontevedra) were built as a system of fortifications to stop Viking raids of Santiago de Compostela. Constant rivalry between the Kingdom of Le√≥n and the Kingdom of Castile opened rifts that could be exploited by outsiders, and Sancho III \\"the Great\\" of Navarre (1004‚Äì1035) absorbed Castile in the 1020s, and added Le√≥n in the last year of his life, leaving Galicia to temporary independence. In the division of lands which followed his death, his son Fernando succeeded to the county of Castile. Two years later, in 1037, he conquered Le√≥n and Galicia. In 1065, Ferdinand I of Castile and Le√≥n divided his kingdom among his sons. Galicia was allotted to Garcia II of Galicia. ===Kingdom of Galicia and Portugal=== The Kingdom of Galicia and Portugal was formed in 1065 after the County of Portugal declared independence following the death of Ferdinand I of Le√≥n. The Count of Portugal, Nuno Mendes, took advantage of the internal tension caused by the civil war between Ferdinand's sons to finally break off and declare himself an independent ruler. However, in 1071 king Garcia II defeated and killed him at the battle of Pedroso, and annexed his territory, adding the title of King of Portugal to his previous ones. In 1072, King Garcia II himself was defeated by his brother Sancho II of Castile and fled. In that same year, after Sancho's murder Alfonso VI became king of Castile and Le√≥n; he imprisoned Garcia for life, proclaiming himself King of Galicia and Portugal as well, thus reuniting his father's realm. From that time Galicia remained part of the kingdom of Castile and Le√≥n, although under differing degrees of self-government. In 1095, Portugal separated almost definitely from the Kingdom of Galicia, both under the rule of the Kingdom of Le√≥n, just like Castile (Burgos). Its territories consisting largely of mountain, moorland and forest, were bounded on the north by the Minho, on the south by the Mondego. ===Santiago and Galicia=== The translation of St James's relics to Galicia in the northwest of Iberia was achieved, in legend, by a series of miraculous happenings: decapitated in Jerusalem with a sword by Herod Agrippa himself, his body was taken up by angels, and sailed in a rudderless, unmanned boat to Iria Flavia in Spain, where a massive rock closed around his relics at Compostela. The Historia Compostellana provides a summary of the legend of St James as it was believed at Compostela in the 12th century. Two propositions are central to it: first, that St James preached the gospel in Spain as well as in the Holy Land; second, that after his martyrdom at the hands of Herod Agrippa I his disciples carried his body by sea to Spain, where they landed at Padr√≥n on the coast of Galicia, and took it inland for burial at [Santiago de Compostela. An even later tradition states that he miraculously appeared to fight for the Christian army during the Battle of Clavijo during the Reconquista, and was henceforth called Matamoros (Moor-slayer). Santiago y cierra Espa√±a (\\"St James and strike for Spain\\") has been the traditional battle cry of Spanish armies. :St. James the Moorslayer, one of the most valiant saints and knights the world ever had ‚Ä¶ has been given by God to Spain for its patron and protection. ‚Äî Cervantes, Don Quixote. The possibility that a cult of James was instituted to supplant the Galician cult of Priscillian (executed in 385), who was widely venerated across the north of Spain as a martyr to the bishops rather than as a heretic, should not be overlooked. ==Modern Age== Galicia was subject to several raids in the 18th century. In 1719, a British expedition led by Lord Cobham captured Vigo and marched inland as far as Santiago de Compostela before withdrawing. ===Emigration=== Apparently due to unusually cold winters throughout the 1850s combined with the prevalence of subsistence agriculture, many Galician family farms went bankrupt. The weather of the decade is sometimes likened to a mini Ice-Age. In January 1850, there was notable snowfall over much of Spain and by February a large number of wolves roamed the countryside. In February 1853, the Galician port cities of Ferrol and A Coru√±a reported heavy snowfall, a highly unusual event. February 1854 was again very cold--on the fourteenth Madrid registered a night-time temperature of -8 ¬∞C. January 1855 was again very cold and snowy over northern Spain.

Spanish Wikipedia. Therefore, according to all these figures, over 12% of the population left Galicia during the period 1836‚Äì1880. Emigration continued well into the 20th century. The noted Galician writer and politician Alfonso Castelao (1886‚Äì1950)--himself an expatriate twice, during his childhood and after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936--chose to see in emigration both an economic imperative and the affirmation of a dauntless spirit. However, the reality of leaving one's homeland was unpleasant for most, whether in the 19th or 20th century, as the photographs of Manuel Ferrol attest.Manuel Ferrol: \\"Reportaje Emigraci√≥n.\\" ==Contemporary Galicia== Modern borders of Galicia. Galician nationalist and federalist movements arose in the 19th century, and after the Second Spanish Republic was declared in 1931, Galicia became an autonomous region following a referendum. Following the Spanish Civil War and once established the Spanish State, a Galician from Ferrol, Galicia's autonomy statute was annulled (as were those of Catalonia and the Basque provinces). Francoist Spain also suppressed any official promotion of the Galician language (although its everyday use was never proscribed). During the last decade of Franco's rule, there was a renewal of nationalist sentiment in Galicia. Following the transition to democracy following Franco's death in 1975, Galicia regained its status as an autonomous region within Spain. Varying degrees of nationalist or separatist sentiment are evident at the political level. The only nationalist party of any electoral significance, the Bloque Nacionalista Galego or BNG, advocates greater autonomy from the Spanish state, and the preservation of Galician heritage and culture. Other factions advocate total independence from Spain, while some smaller groupings aspire to integrate with Portugal and the Portuguese-speaking world. However, the nationalist parties have hitherto obtained only minority electoral support at election time. From 1990 to 2005, the region's government and parliament, the Xunta de Galicia was presided over by the Partido Popular ('People's Party', Spain's main national conservative party) under Manuel Fraga, a former minister and ambassador in the Francoist government. However, in the 2005 Galician elections, the People's Party lost its overall majority, while just remaining the largest party in the parliament. In the event, power passed to a coalition between the Partido Socialista de Galicia (PSdeG) ('Galician Socialist Party'), a regional sister- party of Spain's main socialist party, the Partido Socialista Obrero Espa√±ol ('Spanish Socialist Workers Party') and the BNG. As the senior partner in the new coalition, the PSdeG nominated its leader, Emilio Perez Touri√±o, to serve as Galicia's new president. ==See also== * Timeline of Galician history * Suebi == Notes == ==References== *R.

He was born in Guangzhou and had a secondary school education. He was a member of the Legislative Council from 1991 to 2008. ==Background== Lau smuggled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong in 1960. Since the 1980s, he has been a labour activist, working to help factory workers in Sham Shui Po and Cheung Sha Wan, where working conditions were poor. During the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Lau and other pro-democracy activists expressed sympathy and support to the student demonstrators who had gathered at Tiananmen Square. He and others also founded the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organises the anniversary commemoration of the 1989 protests. In 1990, Lau and other labour activists, including Lee Cheuk-yan, established the 160,000-strong Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions. Lau ran in the Hong Kong legislative elections in 1991, and was elected. Lau was re-elected four times. Lau was a lawmaker continuously from 1991 to 2008, except he resigned in 1994 but elected again in 1995, a brief period during 1997 and 1998 when the sovereignty of Hong Kong was transferred to the People's Republic of China, and the Legislative Council temporarily became a Provisional Legislative Council which was filled with people indirectly hand picked by Beijing. In recent years, however, Lau has moderated his stance against Beijing. He was expelled from the Democratic Party (Hong Kong) in 2000 because of having an identity of two parties. Once branded subversive by the central authorities, Mr Lau had been barred from entering mainland China for more than a decade. In May 2000, after quiet lobbying by Hong Kong top leaders, he was allowed to make a low-key visit to Guangzhou to see his ailing mother. Since then, he has been urging his pro-democracy colleagues to have \\"better communication with the Central Government\\" and visit mainland China and see for themselves the changes that are taking place in the country. Lau lost his seat in the Legislative Council in the Legislative Election of 2008 with only 5.1% or 10,553 votes. On a radio program in September 2008, he announces that he has been diagnosed with colorectal cancer. He says the cancer is under control. ==External links== *Lau Chin-shek's website *Hong Kong Legislative Council's website on Lau Chin-shek *Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions' election campaign website Category:Hong Kong justices of the peace Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong Category:Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions Category:Politicians from Guangzhou Category:Hong Kong trade unionists Category:Democratic Party (Hong Kong) politicians Category:The Frontier (Hong Kong) politicians Category:United Democrats of Hong Kong politicians Category:HK LegCo Members 1991‚Äì1995 Category:HK LegCo Members 1995‚Äì1997 Category:HK LegCo Members 1998‚Äì2000 Category:HK LegCo Members 2000‚Äì2004 Category:HK LegCo Members 2004‚Äì2008 ","title":"Lau Chin-shek"},{"id":"3252238","text":"is a Japanese voice actor employed by the talent management firm 81 Produce.

It also features lectures, workshops in tents, kids' shows, petting zoos, and comedians. Spirit West Coast was founded by five families in 1995. It began in 1997 as a yearly festival in Monterey, California. Later, an additional festival in Del Mar, California, was added. These two festivals are held every summer. The festivals are members of the Christian Festival Association. Many of the most popular Christian acts play concerts for the attendees. These include Michael W. Smith, Audio Adrenaline, Newsboys, Delirious?, Chris Tomlin, Tree63, Jeremy Camp, Armour Under Fire, Rebecca St. James, Skillet, The Kry, Toby Mac, Jars of Clay, Larry Norman and many others. Some of the top Christian speakers and authors give lectures/sermons at Spirit West Coast festivals. Past speakers include Charles Stanley, Greg Laurie, Luis Palau, Tony Campolo, Frank Peretti, Miles McPherson, Ron Luce, and Louie Giglio. At nights popular Christian comedians like Bob Smiley tell jokes in big tents. Compassion International is one of the focuses of SWC. Compassion has a tent where they encourage people to sponsor hungry and needy children in other countries. SWC keeps track of the number of sponsorships and announces the growing number over their loudspeaker. The layout of Spirit West Coast consists of a main stage with large screens for those that have to stand or sit far away. In addition, it features side stages (some inside tents), several merchandise tents, and various other tents (e.g. first aid, lost and found, etc.). There are also numerous food vendors on site. SWC offers camping to those that don't live nearby and to those that don't want to stay in hotels. Buses run from the campgrounds to the main stage, so people don't have to walk too far. These buses generally run until about midnight. Many church groups attend Spirit West Coast. They pack their youth groups into buses and drive to Monterey or Del Mar. SWC offers a special rate for groups. One group calling themselves the \\"Traveling Circus\\" has made particularly visible appearances at the concert every year, starting large dance pits at performances. The group is made of a dozen or so Christian punks, goths and hippies. These festivals last between 3‚Äì4 days. They start around 9am and end around midnight each night. People of all faiths (and no faith) can and do attend. There are invitational messages to repent and trust in Jesus, presented both by the event staff and the individual musicians, and there are also baptisms held at the Monterey festival. Spirit West Coast is run almost entirely by volunteers. Volunteers typically work four- or nine-hour shifts. Some, namely IT, electrical, construction, kitchen crews, operations, navigators, and a few others, work MANY more hours. For these individuals, SWC is an adventure and family reunion that they look forward to year after year. For these departments, and many others, onsite work often begins a week prior to the festival start date and doesn't end for days after when the last items are packed up and stored for the following year. There is much to be done to convert the Del Mar Fairgrounds into a festival site, and even more to be done to convert the dust bowl of Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca. == External links == *Spirit West Coast website *Celebration Concerts *SWC Del Mar Onsite Intranet Portal *SWC Monterey Onsite Intranet Portal Category:Christian music festivals Category:Music festivals in California Category:Del Mar, California Category:Monterey, California Category:Music festivals established in 1997 ","title":"Spirit West Coast"},{"id":"3252252","text":"Asja is a South-Slavic/Russian female name, originating as a pet form of Anastasia and Anna.

Daimos is the third installment of the Robot Romance Trilogy, following Ch≈çdenji Robo Combattler V and Ch≈çdenji Machine Voltes V. It ran from 1 April 1978 to 27 January 1979 and consisted of 44 episodes. The name Daimos is derived from Deimos, one of the two moons of Mars. Tadao Nagahama, who directed the series, is often miscredited as the \\"creator\\" of the trilogy. It was actually created under the collective pseudonym Saburo Yatsude.

The first appearance of Daimos in the United States was in the late 1970s as a part of Mattel's Shogun Warriors line of imported Super Robot toys, and in the early 1980s, 3B Productions strung the pivotal episodes of the show together to form a compilation movie under the title Starbirds. ==Story== After the destruction of their home world, the survivors of the planet Baam head towards Earth with the goal of negotiating the purchase of land for emigration.

It is called Daimos Rocket in the Filipino English dub. **Foot Cutter Blades mounted on Daimos' feet. It is called Daimos Kick Blade in the Filipino English dub **Five Shooter The five golden darts to be thrown to the enemy. It is called Magneto Blades in the Filipino English dub. **Snake Lock A pair of sharp discs with three strings launched from Daimos' elbow. It is called Gyro Whiplash in the Filipino dub version. **Cross Boomerang Two blades are joined to form a shuriken. It is called the Star Boomerang/Double Boomerang in the Filipino English dub. **Souryuu Ken (Double Dragon Blade) The two four headed daggers, which is originally mounted on Daimos' chest, can be retracted any time.

Mounted on Daimos' head, it is capable of sending freezing rays, which freezes the enemy. It is called Freezer Blast in the Filipino English dub. **Fire Blizzard An upgrade of the Double Blizzard, though it does not replace the weapon. It is identical to Double Blizzard, except that it is empowered with fire. It is often used with Freezer Storm, due to the fact that the drastic changes of temperature can effectively weaken the enemy's armor. ***Due to Kazuya's expertise in Karate, he usually finishes off his enemies with these finishing moves, mostly done after launching the enemy with Double Blizzard or Fire Blizzard although in some cases, he uses other means to launch the enemy or not launching them at all.

And the Square Knights of the Round Table is a 1966-1968 Australian animated series based on the legend of King Arthur of Camelot. The series was produced by Air Programs International and written by Melbourne playwright Alex Buzo and British-born entertainer Rod Hull, with Lyle Martin, Michael Robinson, and John Palmer. The characters included King Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, Merlin, the Jester, the Black Knight, and Morgana le Fay. The actors who voiced the character parts in the series included: John Meillon (as \\"Arthur\\"), Lola Brooks (as \\"Guinevere\\" and \\"Morgana le Fay\\"), John Ewart, Kevin Golsby, and Matthew O'Sullivan. By 1969, the series had been sold for broadcast in the United Kingdom and the United States. In Australia, where it was made and produced, it was sold also to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, for broadcast on the ABC-TV network. Typically it was broadcast on Saturday mornings and initially also, on Monday evenings. As the Australian television industry did not go to color broadcast until around March 1975, viewers would view the series in black and white for the first six years of its Australian transmission. This was despite all the episodes having been made in colour. For most of the 1970s, Australia's ABC-TV continued to rerun the series for children's cartoon programming. This was usually on a Saturday morning. During 1980-81, the French purchased the series. However, the series has been completely redone with a French soundtrack, with the original music also removed. In this format, the series was then broadcast on the French television channel, TF1. By 1993, the series was also being broadcast on German cable television. ==Original episodes== ;Episode 1: *Octopus *Would You Believe, A Beanstalk? *Which Wizard Versus What Witch ;Episode 2: *There's An Elephant at the Drawbridge *A Nice Knight for a Wedding *Paris Picnic ;Episode 3: *It's the Only Kingdom I've Got *Old Moody *I'll See If I'm There ;Episode 4: *The Inn *Seventeen Going on Seventy *Will the Real Arthur Please Stand Up ;Episode 5: *The Genie Who Came to Dinner *No Laugh Olaf *Some Maidens Just Aren't Fair ;Episode 6: *New Armour for the King *Smile, Smile, Smile *That's What I Call Music ;Episode 7: *It's the Gift That Counts *The King's Champion *Undercover Knight ;Episode 8: *How Do You Like Them Apples *Pink is In *Get Your Wish Here ;Episode 9: *Little Bundle *The Crown Jewels *Mail-Order Bride ;Episode 10: *The Unicorn of Camelot *Belle of the Ball *While Camelot Sleeps ;Episode 11: *Play Gypsy Play *Be Kind to Dragons *The Search For Guinevere ;Episode 12: *Even Knights Have To Eat *The Wrecker *Assault On Castle Morgana ==Home releases== Revelation Films released a DVD titled \\"Arthur and the Square Knights of the Round Table\\" in 2003.\\"Arthur And The Square Knights of The Round Table, Revelation, PAR 61178, 2003 This Region \\"0\\" DVD has a 200-minute running time and contains the first 8 episodes.

It was later ported without the erotic content to the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation Portable consoles. The story of Snow revolves around the life of Kanata Izumo, who is revisiting a village to help his relative manage a hot spring inn. The gameplay in Snow follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the female main characters by the player character. The game was successful in both sales and popularity, it was ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan at the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterward. Snow was voted as the twenty-sixth best bish≈çjo game by the readers of Dengeki G's Magazine in 2007. A manga titled Snow: Pure White based on the visual novel was serialized in Comptiq between the September and December 2003 issues. Five light novels and several comic anthologies were also released, as were audio dramas. Studio Mebius went on to release a visual novel called Tomodachi Ij≈ç Koibito Miman on September 24, 2004, which shares the same setting and characters from Snow but takes place years later and focuses on Meiko Tachibana. ==Gameplay== Average dialogue and narrative in Snow depicting the main character Kanata talking to Sumino. Snow is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Kanata Izumo. Much of its gameplay is spent reading the text that appears on the screen, which represents the story's narrative and dialogue. The text is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Kanata is talking to, over background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. In the original Windows release, the player must first complete Sumino and Asahi's story routes in order to unlock Shigure's route; after Shigure's route is completed, ≈åka's route becomes available to play which serves as the true ending to Snow. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. Some decisions can lead the game to end prematurely and offer an alternative ending to the plot. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. In adult versions of the game, there are scenes depicting Kanata and a given heroine having sex. ==Plot== ===Story=== The story of Snow starts when the main protagonist Kanata Izumo revisits a small village from his childhood called .

In the village, there is an old legend: In ancient times, Ry≈´jin-mura was protected by the dragon goddess. However, one day the goddess fell in love with a human, which is strictly forbidden, and this incident caused the village to be always covered by snow after that. The game then tells the daily life of Kanata interacting with the village girls and ultimately links the story to the legend. Snow follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. ===Main characters=== The player assumes the role of , who is visiting Ry≈´jin-mura as a part-time worker of the local inn owned by his cousin.

Kazuya Takase from I've Sound composed the songs in Snow, while Famishin composed the background music (BGM). According to the liner notes on the original soundtrack of Snow, the producers acknowledged that the game's structure resembled Key's visual novels Kanon and Air. Y≈´ichi Suzumoto, who is known for his work on various Key games, worked as an assistant writer for Snow. The setting of the game, Ry≈´jin-mura, was modeled after the real village Ry≈´jin in Wakayama Prefecture. On January 31, 2003, Snow was released as both a CD-ROM and DVD-ROM compatible to the Windows 98/ME/2000/XP operating systems. An all-ages version for the Dreamcast was released by Interchannel on September 25, 2003. Later on February 26, 2004, Interchannel ported the game to the PlayStation 2 in both limited and regular editions; the PS2 port adds an additional scenario for Meiko Tachibana who was a supporting character in prior releases of Snow. A fully voiced version was released for Windows on September 24, 2004.

During the beginning of February, the CD-ROM ranked at number eight, while the DVD-ROM ranked just above at number seven. The DVD-ROM made another appearance in the ranking at 31 during mid-February and the CD-ROM had low enough sales to not chart. Finally, both the CD-ROM and DVD-ROM versions made their final appearances on the charts at 33 and 46 at the beginning of March, respectively. The game is now regarded as a classic in the nakige visual novel genre, though some gamers were confused about Studio Mebius' change of direction with Snow since they were a brand known for producing dark and graphic eroge.

According to sales information taken from the Japanese Amazon website, Snow sold 64,526 copies in 2003. As of February 4, 2013, the PS2 version of Snow sold over 24,385 copies.

He may have been active during the middle of the thirteenth century, judging from scriptological analysis . He is one of only two out of a total of 88 authors of cantigas d'amigo who used only the archaic strophic form aaB (a rhymed distich followed by a refrain). He employed an archaic rhyme-system whereby i~o / a~o were used in alternating strophes. In addition Martin Codax consistently utilised a strict parallelistic technique known as leixa-pren (see the example below; the order of the third and fourth strophes is inverted in the Pergaminho Vindel but the correct order appears in the Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional and the Cancioneiro da Vaticana). There is no documentary biographical information concerning the poet, dating the work at present remains based on theoretical analysis of the text. == Works in the Pergaminho Vindel == The body of work attributed to him consists of seven cantigas d'amigo which appear in the Galician-Portuguese songbooks and in the Pergaminho Vindel (Vindel parchment). In all three manuscripts he is listed as the author of the compositions, in all three the number and order of the songs is the same. This provides what may be important evidence to support the view that the order of other poets' songs in the cancioneiros (songbooks) should not automatically be dismissed as random or attributed to later compilers. The identification of authorship of the poems (and their order) may contribute to a viewpoint that the seven songs of Codax reflect an original performance set. Consequently, the sets of poems by other poets might also have been organized for performance. The parchment was originally discovered by the Madrid-based antiquarian bookseller and bibliophile Pedro Vindel among his possessions in 1913; it had been used as the cover of a copy of Cicero's De Officiis. Martim Codax's poems that appeared in the parchment are the following (originally untitled, they are listed by the first verse): *Ondas do mar de Vigo *Mandad'ey comigo *Mia irmana fremosa treydes comigo *Ay Deus, se sab'ora meu amigo *Quantas sabedes amar amigo *Eno sagrad' en Vigo *Ay ondas que eu vin veer In the Pergaminho Vindel, musical notation (although with lacunae) survives along with the texts, except for the sixth one. They are the only cantigas d'amigo for which the music is known (and, if Codax was indeed Galician, the only medieval Galician secular songs; see Cantigas de Santa Maria). The Pergaminho Sharrer contains seven melodies for cantigas d'amor of Denis of Portugal, also in fragmentary form. == A cantiga by Martin Codax == Here is the third of his songs (text from , slightly modified; tr. R. Cohen) ==See also== Paseo de Alfonso XII de Vigo: A fada e o drag√≥n The sculpture, cast in bronze, represents a nymph with two flutes, riding a winged dragon's back. With this piece, the artist () pays tribute to Galicia's oral culture and the medieval poets and troubadours who, like Martin Codax, or Mendinho, celebrated the bounties of Vigo's sea. *Cantiga de amigo *Galician- Portuguese *Galician-Portuguese lyric *Pergaminho Sharrer == Basic bibliography == *Cohen, Rip. 2010.

Retrieved on October 4, 2011. \\"Between 6th and 11th Streets, South Street to Washington Avenue.\\" It currently has a population of 5,898. ==History== Prior to the Act of Consolidation of 1854, Bella Vista was part of the Moyamensing Township. It was sparsely settled until the 1840s and 1850s when it became an impoverished area on the outskirts of the industrializing city. The New York Tribune noted in 1848 that the districts of Moyamensing and nearby Southwark were composed of \\"the most graceless vagabonds and unmitigated ruffians\\" as well as \\"loafers\\" who were members of various gangs.South Philadelphia.\\" Philadelphia Encyclopedia. Retrieved November 8, 2014 In addition to Irish immigrants, it was also once home to a large portion of the city's population of African descent, many of whom were former slaves from the South. In 1852, the Institute for Colored Youth, a school (and later college) for people of African descent, was established at 10th and Bainbridge. During the late 1800s, Italian immigrants began settling the area in large numbers, which reshaped the neighborhood's character. One of the earliest immigrants, Antonio Palumbo, opened a boardinghouse (Palumbo's) on the corner of 9th and Catharine in 1884 that became the social center of the neighborhood's growing Italian community. The planned construction of the South Street Expressway in the 1960s led to a drop in property values in the neighborhood. Many of the neighborhood's residents subsequently fled to the suburbs. As they did in adjacent Queen Village, developers and city planners attempted to rebrand the neighborhood and began referring to it as \\"Bella Vista\\" in the early 1970s. The city eventually scrapped plans for the second cross-town expressway. In the late 1970s, the neighborhood began to gentrify due to its proximity to Center City. In 1982, it was featured as a case study in Michael Lang's Gentrification Amid Urban Decline: Strategies for America's Older Cities. During the same era, the neighborhood also experienced an influx of Vietnamese and Mexican immigrants, especially near Washington Ave. While much of the Italian-American community has moved deeper into South Philadelphia, i.e. further south of Bella Vista into neighborhoods such as Marconi Plaza, many Italian shops and restaurants still remain clustered along the market on 9th Street. The Samuel S. Fleisher Art Memorial, Institute for Colored Youth, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper House, George W. Nebinger School, and Washington Avenue Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ===Historical Markers Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission=== Bronze plaques installed in Bella Vista by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission that commemorate individuals, events, and landmarks.

Film wind is by thumb-wheel, aperture is set on the body using a small lever, focus is set by a small lever below the lens, film speed (ISO) is set on a dial below the lens, the viewfinder is optical direct-view with the rangefinder frame embedded in it and a display of the shutter speed at the side. Later cameras, models XA2 to XA4, featured scale focusing instead of rangefinders. The XA1 used a fixed-focus lens. Although the cameras resembled each other, there were subtle differences in design. The XA3 and XA4 were slightly larger than the XA and XA2. The original XA's dust cover dome resembled a flattened oval, whereas the other models had a more rounded design. * Olympus XA: small rangefinder with aperture priority 35mm f/2.8 lens * Olympus XA1: simple mechanical camera with a selenium meter * Olympus XA2: scale focus camera, automatic shutter 35mm f/3.5 lens * Olympus XA3: Same as XA2 with \\"DX\\" automatic film speed recognition * Olympus XA4: distance focus camera, 28mm wide macro lens The XA series was accompanied by a range of detachable flash units. The standard A11 took one AA battery and had a guide number of 10. The A16 took two batteries and had a guide number of 16.

Stefano Maderno (c. 1576 - 17 September 1636) was an Italian sculptor. ==Biography== News about Maderno's life are scarce and often contradictory. He was long supposed to have been a brother of the contemporary architect Carlo Maderno, and therefore to having been born at Capolago, in what is now Ticino: his death certificate, however, gave his place of birth as Palestrina (Donati 1945) and he signed a bas-relief in the Cappella Paolina in Santa Maria Maggiore as a Roman: STEPHANVS MADERNVS ROMANVS F (\\"Stefano Maderno of Rome made [this]\\"). He is best known for the seemingly unposed, naturalistic recumbent marble of Santa Cecilia in the Church of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere (1599‚Äì1600), which immediately established his reputation. Elected to the Accademia di San Luca in 1607, Maderno became the pre-eminent sculptor of his generation, on the cusp between Mannerism and Baroque, rivalled in his prime only by Camillo Mariani, though he was eclipsed in his later years by the rapidly rising star of Bernini. His patron, Count Gaspare Rivaldi, having sought to reward him by procuring for him a sinecure at the excise offices of the Gabelle di Ripetta, the sculptor dutifully devoted his time to his new duties and neglected his art. ==Works== The  ª ªSanta Cecilia ª ª was a counter-statement to the current dry and hectic complications of Mannerism, to which it confronted a simple sweeping outline and a stark pose. This is not a sanitized hagiographical representation of a saint, but the graphic representation of an uncorrupted corpse, claimed to be positioned just as it had been found. The saint's tomb had been opened in 1599, and Cardinal Paolo Emilio Sfondrato commissioned Maderno, very young at the time, to recreate the martyr's body in marble. Compare this statue with the passionately theatrical representations of Saint Theresa and Ludovica Albertoni by Bernini, and the Santa Rosa de Lima by Melchiorre Caff√†. He also provided a marble Prudence for the tomb of Michele Bonelli, known as the Cardinale Alessandrino, in Santa Maria sopra Minerva, and provided two bas- reliefs for Paul V's Cappella Paolina at Santa Maria Maggiore (1608-1615); probably the figure of St. Peter for the fa√ßade of the Quirinal Palace; a statue of St. Charles Borromeo in the church of San Lorenzo in Damaso; decorative figures of putti in the Sistine Chapel of Santa Maria Maggiore, angels of the Madonna di Loreto and Santa Maria sopra Minerva and the reclining figures of Peace and Justice for the high altar at Santa Maria della Pace. Of the few sculptures outside of Italy, Cincinnati has a small bronze (c. 1622-25) portraying Hercules and Antaeus, wherein Hercules has to lift Antaeus off the ground to kill him . Finally there are several bozzetti-- terracotta sketches, in Maderno's case highly finished ones-- at the Hermitage, which came from the collection of Abate Filippo Farsetti in Venice, who possessed several of Maderno's terracottas, a form in which Maderno specialized. Tsar Paul I of Russia began acquiring Farsetti's collection in 1800, and the transfer to Saint Petersburg was completed in 1805 by Tsar Alexander I . One of the Hermitage terracottas is a suggested restoration of the Laoco√∂n, the correct restoration of which was a classic puzzle for 16th- and 17th-century virtuosi-- another a variation on the Farnese Hercules, and yet another a remarkable Piet√† (c. 1605), where Nicodemus holds the dead Christ in his lap, a conscious response to Michelangelo's Piet√† Further terracottas are in the collection at the Ca' d'Oro, Venice.

It stars Bill Pullman as \\"the world's most private detective\\", Daryl Zero, and Ben Stiller as his assistant Steve Arlo. Its plot is loosely based on the Arthur Conan Doyle short story \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\". The film was shot in Portland, Oregon. It was scored by The Greyboy Allstars. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival. ==Plot== Daryl Zero is the world's greatest detective, but is also a socially maladroit misanthrope. Among his quirks is that he never meets or has direct contact with his clients, instead conducting business through his assistant, Steve Arlo. Throughout the movie, Zero provides narration as he reads lines from his proposed autobiography. Zero and Arlo are hired by Portland area millionaire Gregory Stark. Stark has lost the key to a safe deposit box and is being blackmailed by an unknown person who forces him to follow elaborate instructions to deliver the cash payments. Zero quickly discovers that the blackmailer is Gloria Sullivan, an EMT with a mysterious past. Zero becomes attracted to Gloria and they sleep together, compromising his trademark objectivity. He lets his guard down and tells her that his abusive father killed his mother and himself. Stark pressures Arlo to reveal the blackmailer's identity so that he can have that person killed. Arlo must also deal with Zero's absurd demands on his time, which increasingly interfere with Arlo's relationship with his girlfriend Jess. Zero eventually discovers that Stark had raped Gloria's mother after she broke up with him. She later blackmailed Stark with the threat of exposing him as a rapist, so he had her killed. However, she had already given birth to their daughter Gloria, who was discovered and raised by the hitman who killed her mother. Gloria grew up knowing that Stark was behind her mother's murder, and when her adoptive father contracted a terminal illness, she used the information to pay for medical treatment. At the meeting to deliver the final blackmail payment, Stark collapses from a heart attack and Gloria is compelled to save his life. She then flees the country with Zero's assistance. ==Cast== * Bill Pullman as Daryl Zero * Ben Stiller as Steve Arlo * Ryan O'Neal as Gregory Stark * Kim Dickens as Gloria Sullivan * Angela Featherstone as Jess ==Soundtrack== Released in January 1998, the official soundtrack for the film includes: # \\"Mystery Dance\\" ‚Äì Elvis Costello # \\"One Dance\\" ‚Äì Dan Bern # \\"Starbucked\\" ‚Äì Bond # \\"Into My Arms\\" ‚Äì Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds # \\"Some Jingle Jangle Morning\\" ‚Äì Mary Lou Lord # \\"Emma J\\" ‚Äì Brendan Benson # \\"The Method Pt. 2\\" ‚Äì The Greyboy Allstars # \\"Drifting Along\\" ‚Äì Jamiroquai # \\"Till You Die\\" ‚Äì Candy Butchers # \\"Lounge\\" ‚Äì Esthero # \\"Blackmail Drop\\" ‚Äì The Greyboy Allstars # \\"Three Days\\" ‚Äì Thermadore # \\"Rest My Head Against the Wall\\" ‚Äì Heatmiser # \\"The Zero Effect\\" ‚Äì The Greyboy Allstars ==Reception== Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 65% of 51 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.67/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"A promising debut for writer/director Jake Kasdan, Zero Effect overcomes its flaws with its off-kilter humor and likeable leads.\\" Leonard Klady of Variety called it \\"scattershot entertainment that misses as often as it hits its targets\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated 3.5/4 stars and wrote that he was surprised by how involved he became in the film. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote of the film's focus on the relation between Pullman and Stiller, \\"For all its admirable ambitions, this loosely focused first feature has the makings of a better buddy story than detective tale anyhow.\\" Jack Matthews of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"a confident first film and one of the freshest detective yarns to come along in a while\\". Ruthe Stein of The San Francisco Chronicle rated it 2/4 stars and called it \\"more an interesting idea for a detective movie than it is an interesting film\\". Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly rated it C+ and called it \\"a very shaggy and minor comedy\\". Geoff Andrew of Time Out London wrote, \\"Kasdan's is a very promising debut, its own dearth of feeling offset by able writing, engaging playing and a sure sense of pace.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on an A+ to F scale. ==Television pilot== In 2002 Kasdan attempted to resurrect the character Daryl Zero for the NBC television network. He shared the screenwriting duties with Walon Green and directed the pilot. He was also one of the producers. The series was intended to be a prequel, tracing the early adventures of Zero as he and Arlo became a team. The pilot stars Alan Cumming as Daryl Zero and features Krista Allen and Natasha Gregson Wagner. NBC did not pick up the pilot. ==References* * Category:1998 films Category:1990s comedy mystery films Category:American films Category:American comedy mystery films Category:American comedy thriller films Category:English-language films Category:1990s comedy thriller films Category:Detective films Category:1998 directorial debut films Category:Films set in Oregon Category:Films shot in Portland, Oregon Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:Castle Rock Entertainment films Category:Films directed by Jake Kasdan Category:1998 comedy films ","title":"Zero Effect"},{"id":"3252457","text":"Involuntary dismissal is the termination of a court case despite the plaintiff's objection. In United States federal courts, involuntary dismissal is governed by Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) Rule 41(b). Involuntary dismissal is made by a defendant through a motion for dismissal, on grounds that plaintiff is not prosecuting the case, is not complying with a court order, or to comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Involuntary dismissal can also be made by order of the judge when no defendant has made a motion to dismiss. Involuntary dismissal is a punishment that courts may use when a party to a case is not acting properly. Other punishments are found in FRCP Rule 11, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 38, sections 1927 and 1912 of Title 28 United States Code, and inherent powers of the court. Involuntary dismissal bars the case from being brought to court again, unless the judge says otherwise. State court rules may be different from the Federal rules and vary from state to state.

For failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court, a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against the defendant. Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and any dismissal not provided for in the rules, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, for improper venue, or for failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an adjudication on the merits. ==See also== * Voluntary dismissal Category:Civil procedure ","title":"Involuntary dismissal"},{"id":"3252486","text":"The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) performs the research and engineering that enables the U.S. Government, national and international standards organizations, and many aspects of private industry to manage the radio spectrum and ensure that innovative, new technologies are recognized and effective. Past experience, current knowledge, and facilities allow the institute to solve complex telecommunications problems, as well as visually postulate the significant needs for the future. ITS is notable for pioneering work on radio wave propagation, development of measurement methods to characterize complex signals, and predict end-to-end system performance. This government entity also provides research and engineering that is critical to continued U.S. leadership in telecommunications technology. (Dept. of Commerce) ==Overview== The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) is the research and engineering laboratory of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), and a part of the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC). ITS supports such NTIA telecommunications objectives as promotion of advanced telecommunications and information infrastructure development in the United States, enhancement of domestic competitiveness, improvement of foreign trade opportunities for U.S. telecommunications firms, and facilitation of more efficient and effective use of the radio spectrum. ITS also serves as a principal Federal resource for solving the telecommunications concerns of other Federal agencies, state and local governments, private corporations and associations, and international organizations. These problems fall into the areas of communications technology use (including RF, PSTN and IP/IT). ITS works with government (U.S. government) agencies and private organizations to explore, understand, and improve the use of telecommunications technologies and principles; investigate and invent new technologies and overcome telecommunications challenges. Research and expertise are employed not only for contributions to standards creation, but also to analyze new and emerging technologies, as well as improve telecommunications trade opportunities. ==Federal Technology Transfer Act== Cooperative research agreements based upon the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 are the principal means of aiding the private sector. This Act provides the legal basis for and encourages shared use of Government facilities and resources with the private sector in advanced telecommunications technologies. These partnerships aid in the commercialization of new products and services. The movement of technology from the federal laboratories to industry and to state and local governments is achieved through technology transfer. Technology transfer is a process by which technology developed in one organization, in one area, or for one purpose is applied in another organization, in another area, or for another purpose. ==Program areas== As of 2009 the Institute's technical activities are organized into four program areas. These are: Spectrum and Propagation Measurements ‚Ä¢ Telecommunications and Information Technology Planning ‚Ä¢ Telecommunications Engineering, Analysis, and Modeling ‚Ä¢ and finally Telecommunications theory. ===Facilities=== The Institute's facilities and capabilities include the following: ‚Ä¢ Audio-Visual Laboratories ‚Ä¢ Public Safety RF Laboratory ‚Ä¢ Public Safety Audio and Video Laboratories ‚Ä¢ Radio Spectrum Measurement Science (RSMS) Program ‚Ä¢ Secure Internet (SIPRNET) ‚Ä¢ Table Mountain Field Site/Radio Quiet Zone ‚Ä¢ Telecommunications Analysis Services ===Staff=== ITS‚Äô staff of Federal employees have strong engineering and scientific skills and experience. The majority of employees are electronics engineers; the rest are mathematicians, physicists, computer scientists, and administrative staff. ==Sponsors== ITS also describes itself as a valuable resource, which supports many Federal agencies and industry organization. ===Government=== The DOC and other Federal agencies sponsor the activities and programs of the Institute. Agency sponsors that provide significant support include the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Office of Law Enforcement Standards, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Defense, the National Archives, and the National Weather Service. ===Industry=== ITS supports private sector telecommunications research through cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs) based on the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986. The Act encourages sharing of Government facilities and expertise as an aid in the commercialization of new products and services. ITS is a member of the Federal Laboratory Consortium for Technology Transfer (FLC), formally chartered by the Federal Technology Transfer Act in 1986. CRADAs with other research organizations, telecommunications service providers, and equipment manufacturers support technology transfer and commercialization of telecommunications products and services, which are major goals of the DOC. ITS has had CRADAs with large companies as well as with small start-ups. Partnerships such as these enhance synergies between entrepreneurial ventures and broad national goals.2009 Technical Progress Report. ITS. 2010. (accessdate: 2010-07-01) ==History== The Institute began in the 1940s as the Interservice Radio Propagation Laboratory, which later became the Central Radio Propagation Laboratory (CRPL) of the National Bureau of Standards in the U.S. Department of Commerce. A new facility was built for CRPL in Boulder, Colorado, and dedicated by President Eisenhower in September 1954. In 1965, CRPL became part of the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA). At that time, CRPL was renamed the Institute for Telecommunication Sciences and Aeronomy (ITSA). In 1967, ITSA split into four labs within ESSA: the Aeronomy Laboratory, the Space Disturbances Laboratory, the Wave Propagation Laboratory, and the Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS). In 1970, Executive Order 11556 established the Office of Telecommunications (OT) within the Department of Commerce and the Office of Telecommunications Policy (OTP) in the Executive Office of the President. At the same time, ITS was transferred into OT. Finally, under the President's Reorganization Act #1 of 1977, OT and the Office of Telecommunications Policy merged to form the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). Since that time, ITS has performed telecommunications research and provided technical engineering support to NTIA and to other Federal agencies on a reimbursable basis. Over the past decade, ITS has expanded its historical role by conducting cooperative research and development with U.S. industry and academia under the provisions of the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986. ==Critique of Domestic technology transfer== * * ==References== ==External links== * ITS Home page Category:United States communications regulation Category:United States Department of Commerce ","title":"Institute for Telecommunication Sciences"},{"id":"3252498","text":"The APF Microcomputer System is a second generation 8-bit cartridge-based home video game console released in October 1978 by APF Electronics Inc. with six cartridges.APF Microcomputer System The console is often referred to M-1000 or MP-1000, which are the two model numbers of the console.

It occurs when the inertia of a heavy fuselage exceeds the ability of the aerodynamic forces and moments generated by the wing and empennage to stabilize the aircraft. The problem became apparent as jet fighter aircraft and research aircraft were developed with narrow wingspans, that had relatively low roll inertia, caused by a long slender high-density fuselage, compared to the pitch and yaw inertias. The term inertia/inertial coupling referring to divergence during a rolling maneuver has been described as misleading because the complete problem is one of aerodynamic as well as inertia coupling. Contributions to the maneuver are complex and include inertial coupling, aerodynamic coupling and the inertia ratios about the three axes, all of which occur simultaneously.https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA170960/page/n781?q=flying+qualities+textbook+test+pilot+school 9.1 However, inertial coupling has also been defined as essentially a gyroscopic effect, i.e. a tendency of a fuselage, when rolled rapidly, to swing away from the direction of flight and become broadside to the wind, and analyzed as such by Phillips.Airplane Stability and Control - Second edition, Abzug and Larrabee, Cambridge University Press, , p.109 Inertial roll coupling has been defined as a resonant divergence in pitch or yaw when roll rate equals the lower of the pitch or yaw natural frequencies.https://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/pdf/88484main_H-2106.pdf p.1 ==Description== Inertia coupling will tend to occur when an aircraft with the weight distribution described above is quickly rolled about an axis other than its roll axis. The tendency can be countered by a number of strategies which include increasing directional stability and reducing allowed roll rate and duration and limiting angle of attack for performing rolling maneuvers. The cause of the disturbing motion may be visualised by thinking of the aircraft mass being concentrated in two locations, \\"dumbbell-fashion\\" on its roll axis, one in front of the centre of gravity and the other behind. The aircraft will be flying along its aerodynamic or wind axis with the \\"dumbbell\\" at some angle of attack. Rolling about the aerodynamic axis will tend to cause the \\"off- axis\\" masses to move outwards. The trend in fighter aircraft design through the 1950s short wing spans, fuselages of high density and flight at high altitude all tended to increase the inertia forces due to rolling in comparison with the aerodynamic restoring forces provided by the longitudinal and directional stabilities. Rolling motion introduces coupling between longitudinal and lateral motions of the aircraft.http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/1948/naca-tn-1627.pdf p.2 Although a typical jet aircraft has most of its mass distributed close to its centerline, and the aerodynamic forces and moments in planes which provide some stabilization (such that small fluctuations in control tend to return it to attitude equilibrium), it is important to remember that aircraft realistically always fly with a small non-zero random rate of yawing and pitching. ==Early history== Inertial roll coupling was predicted and analyzed as a gyroscopic effect in 1948https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930082293.pdf by William Phillips who worked for the NACA. His analysis predated the aircraft that would experience the violent motions he predicted, the X-series research aircraft and Century-series fighter aircraft in the early 1950s. Prior to this time, aircraft tended to have greater width than length, and their mass was generally distributed closer to the center of mass. This was especially true for propeller aircraft, but equally true for early jet fighters as well. It was only when the aircraft began to sacrifice aerodynamic surface area in order to reduce drag, and use longer fineness ratios that reduced supersonic drag, that the effect became obvious. In these cases, the aircraft was generally much more fuselage-heavy, allowing its gyroscopic effect to overwhelm the small control surfaces. Inertial roll coupling was one of three distinct coupling modes which followed one another at Mach 3.2https://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/pdf/88484main_H-2106.pdf p.8 killing pilot Captain Mel Apt in his first flight in the rocket-powered Bell X-2 on 27 September 1956. Inertial roll coupling had nearly killed Chuck Yeager in the X-1A three years earlier. The roll coupling study of the X-3 Stiletto (first flown in 1952) was extremely short but produced valuable data. Abrupt aileron rolls were conducted at Mach 0.92 and 1.05 and produced \\"disturbing\\" motions and excessive accelerations and loads.https://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/pdf/88484main_H-2106.pdf p.36 The first two production aircraft to experience inertial roll coupling were the F-100 Super Sabre and F-102 Delta Dagger (both first flown in 1953). The F-100 was modified with a larger vertical tail to increase its directional stability.https://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/pdf/88484main_H-2106.pdf p.39 The F-102 was modified to increase wing and tail areas and was fitted with an augmented control system. To enable pilot control during dynamic motion maneuvers the tail area of the F-102A was increased 40%. In the case of the F-101 Voodoo (first flown in 1954), a stability augmentation system was retrofitted to the A models to help combat this problem. The Douglas Skyray was not able to incorporate any design changes to control inertial roll coupling and instead had restricted maneuver limits at which coupling effects did not cause problems.Airplane Stability and Control - Second edition, Abzug and Larrabee, Cambridge University Press, , p.119 The Lockheed F-104 Starfighter (first flown in 1956) had its stabilator (horizontal tail surface) mounted atop its vertical fin to reduce inertia coupling. ==References== Category:Aviation risks Category:Aerodynamics Category:Chuck Yeager ","title":"Inertia coupling"},{"id":"3252575","text":"Vince Sorrenti (born 21 March 1966) is an Australian stand-up comedian, writer and television presenter from Punchbowl, New South Wales.

In the same year he co wrote with Larry Buttrose a feature film entitled Gino (1994). The screenplay was awarded full funding by the FFC (Film Finance Corporation). It received a limited release and was nominated for an AFI Award (Production Design) Whilst studying Architecture at Sydney University, he played Rugby Union and became a keen advocate of student causes. During this time, on annual retreats to Don Hearn's Health Cabins at Munyana on the New South Wales south coast, his eclectic style of stand-up comedy was born. His 'unbelievable' catch-phrase, the product of firm friendships within the Australian Customs Service, evolved during these sabbaticals. A gregarious raconteur, he also enjoys an occasional quiet beer at his favourite haunt, the Star Hotel in Milton or fresh shucked oysters from Don Hearn's private lease. Donny was an amiable mentor and Vince was deeply affected by his passing. Each year on the anniversary of his death Vince re-enacts Donny's Saturday night Land Rover drive to Bendalong bottle shop with the pet magpie perched on the steering wheel (apparently) calling the shots. The alacrity of believing a magpie needs chocolates (really for Donny's mistress back at the caravan) amused Vince immensely. Sorrenti has represented many brands over the years. He is currently the face of Tyreright and Allhomes. In August 2018, Sorrenti was announced as a presenter on the Nine Network new travel series Helloworld, which aired on 7 October 2018. Sorrenti premiered in episode 1 as the Italy and France travel reporter. ==Recognition == Vince Sorrenti is a five-time winner of the Mo Award, presented as recognition of excellence in live performance.

This Muisca tradition became the origin of the legend of El Dorado. Muisca raft in the Gold Museum, Bogot√°, Colombia Votive objects found at the bottom of Lake Guatavita in the British Museum.British Museum Collection Lake Guatavita (Spanish: Laguna Guatavita) is located in the Cordillera Oriental of the Colombian Andes in the municipality of Sesquil√© in the Almeidas Province, Cundinamarca department of Colombia, northeast of Bogot√°, the capital of Colombia. The lake is circular and has a surface area of 19.8 hectares. The earlier theories of the crater's origin being a meteorite impact, volcanic cinder, or limestone sinkhole are now discredited. The most likely explanation is that it resulted from the dissolution of underground salt deposits from an anticline, resulting in a kind of sinkhole. There are hot springs nearby in the municipality of Sesquil√©, which means \\"hot water\\" in the now-extinct language of Chibcha, once spoken by the local indigenous people, the Muisca. Spanish colonizers and Conquistadors knew about the existence of a sacred lake in the Eastern Ranges of the Andes possibly as early as 1531. The lake was associated with indigenous rituals involving gold. However, the first conquistador to arrive at the actual location was Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada, possibly in June 1537, while on an expedition to the highlands of the Eastern Ranges of the Andes in search of gold. This brought the Spanish into first contact with the Muisca inhabiting the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, including around Lake Guatavita. The lake is now a focus of ecotourism, and its association with the legend of El Dorado is also a major attraction. == Etymology == The name of the lake is derived from Chibcha, the language of the Muisca: gwa: mountain or gwata, gwate: high elevation, or gwatibita: high mountain peak; hence, a pool at a high mountain peak.M. Louis Ghisletti, Los Mwiskas, Bogota, 1954 Another meaning is \\"End of the farmfields\\". Official website Guatavita == Muisca mythology == Lake Guatavita was reputedly one of the sacred lakes of the Muisca, and a ritual conducted there is widely thought to be the basis for the legend of El Dorado, \\"the golden one\\". The legend says the lake is where the Muisca celebrated a ritual in which the zipa (named \\"El Dorado\\" by the conquistadors) was covered in gold dust, and then, venturing out into the water on a ceremonial raft made of rushes, dove into the waters, washing off the gold. Afterward, trinkets, jewelry, and other precious offerings were thrown into the waters by worshipers. A few artifacts of gold and silver found at bottom hold proof to this claim; however, to date, attempts to drain the lake or salvage the gold (see Lake Guatavita gold) have yielded no more than these. == Trivia == * Lake Guatavita is the filming location of the music video of the song No Te Pido Flores by Fanny L√∫ == See also == * Muisca religion * Guatavita myth * Lake Iguaque, another sacred lake of the Muisca * Siecha Lakes, other lakes implicated in the El Dorado legend * Tomin√© Reservoir, which buried the old town of Guatavita * Tunjo, offer pieces in Lake Guatavita * Gold Museum, Bogot√°, where archaeological objects from the lake are displayed == References == == External links == * * Lake Guatavita - Colparques Guatavita Guatavita Guatavita Category:Geography of Cundinamarca Department Guatavita Guatavita Guatavita Lakes Guatavita ","title":"Lake Guatavita"},{"id":"3252631","text":"A middlebox or network appliance is a computer networking device that transforms, inspects, filters, and manipulates traffic for purposes other than packet forwarding. These extraneous functions have interfered with application performance and have been criticized for violating \\"important architectural principles\\" such as the end-to-end principle. Examples of middleboxes include firewalls, network address translators (NATs), load balancers, and deep packet inspection (DPI) boxes. UCLA computer science professor Lixia Zhang coined the term middlebox in 1999. == Middlebox usage == Middleboxes are widely deployed across both private and public networks. Dedicated middlebox hardware is widely deployed in enterprise networks to improve network security and performance, however, even home network routers often have integrated firewall, NAT, or other middlebox functionality. One 2017 study counting more than 1,000 deployments in autonomous systems, in both directions of traffic flows, and across a wide range networks, including mobile operators and data center networks. === Examples === The following are examples of commonly deployed middleboxes: * Firewalls filter traffic based on a set of predefined security rules defined by a network administrator. IP firewalls reject packets \\"based purely on fields in the IP and transport headers (e.g., disallow incoming traffic to certain port numbers, disallow any traffic to certain subnets etc.)\\" Other types of firewalls may use more complex rulesets, including those that inspect traffic at the session or application layer. * Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) monitor traffic and collect data for offline analysis for security anomalies. Unlike firewalls, IDSs do not filter packets in real time, as they are capable of more complex inspection and must decide whether to accept or reject each packet as it arrives. * Network address translators (NATs) replace the source and/or destination IP addresses of packets that traverse them. Typically, NATs are deployed to allow multiple end hosts to share a single IP address: hosts \\"behind\\" the NAT are assigned a private IP address and their packets destined to the public Internet traverse a NAT, which replaces their internal private address with a shared public address. These are widely used by cellular network providers to manage scarce resources. * WAN optimizers improve bandwidth consumption and perceived latency between endpoints. Typically deployed in large enterprises, WAN optimizers are deployed near both sending and receiving endpoints of communication; the devices then coordinate to cache and compress traffic that traverses the Internet. * Load balancers provide one point of entry to a service, but forward traffic flows to one or more hosts that actually provide the service. * Cellular networks use middleboxes to ensure scarce network resources are used efficiently as well as to protect client devices. == Criticism and challenges == Middleboxes have generated technical challenges for application development and have incurred \\"scorn\\" and \\"dismay\\" in the network architecture community for violating the end-to-end principle of computer system design. === Application interference === Some middleboxes interfere with application functionality, restricting or preventing end host applications from performing properly. In particular, network address translators (NATs) present a challenge in that NAT devices divide traffic destined to a public IP address across several receivers. When connections between a host on the Internet and a host behind the NAT are initiated by the host behind the NAT, the NAT learns that traffic for that connection belongs to the local host. Thus, when traffic coming from the Internet is destined to the public (shared) address on a particular port, the NAT can direct the traffic to the appropriate host. However, connections initiated by a host on the Internet do not present the NAT any opportunity to \\"learn\\" which internal host the connection belongs to. Moreover, the internal host itself may not even know its own public IP address to announce to potential clients what address to connect to. To resolve this issue, several new protocols have been proposed. Additionally, because middlebox deployments by cell operators such as AT&T; and T-Mobile are opaque, application developers are often \\"unaware of the middlebox policies enforced by operators\\" while operators lack full knowledge about application behavior and requirements. For example, one carrier set an \\"aggressive timeout value to quickly recycle the resources held by inactive TCP connections in the firewall, unexpectedly causing frequent disruptions to long-lived and occasionally idle connections maintained by applications such as push-based email and instant messaging\\". Other common middlebox-induced application challenges include web proxies serving \\"stale\\" or out-of-date content, and firewalls rejecting traffic on desired ports. === Internet extensibility and design === One criticism of middleboxes is they can limit the choice of transport protocols, thus limiting application or service designs. Middleboxes may filter or drop traffic that does not conform to expected behaviors, so new or uncommon protocols or protocol extensions may be filtered out. Specifically, because middleboxes make hosts in private address realms unable to \\"pass handles allowing other hosts to communicate with them\\" has hindered the spread of newer protocols like the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as well as various peer-to-peer systems. This progressive reduction in flexibility has been described as protocol ossification. Conversely, some middleboxes can assist in protocol deployment by providing a translation between new and old protocols. For example, IPv6 can be deployed on public endpoints such as load balancers, proxies, or other forms of NAT, with backend traffic routed over IPv4 or IPv6. == See also == * End-to-end connectivity * Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) * Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) * Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN) * Multilayer switch == References == Category:Computer network security Category:Words coined in the 1990s ","title":"Middlebox"},{"id":"3252634","text":"Austen Tayshus (born 17 March 1954) is the stage name of Jewish Australian comedian Alexander Jacob Gutman (commonly called Sandy Gutman).

The camera is essentially an EOS 630/EOS 600 with a pellicle mirror. Only 25,000 were manufactured at the end of the EOS 630 production run, so the EOS RT was technically \\"out of production\\" before it ever went on sale.http://bobatkins.com/photography/eosfaq/eosfaq24/9miscellany.html#q22 The EOS RT was the first autofocus camera to feature a pellicle mirror, followed by the EOS 1N RS five years later. Canon had made a few manual focus pellicle mirror SLR bodies previously, including the Pellix, Pellix QL, and special limited-production cameras made for professional photographers at the 1972 and 1984 Olympic Games (the F-1 and New F-1 High Speed Motor Drive models respectively). Pellicle mirrors offer some of the advantages of a rangefinder camera in an SLR. When taking a picture with a typical SLR camera, the mirror must flip upwards to move out of the way to allow light to pass from the lens to the film plane (or digital image sensor). Moving the mirror produces noise, introduces vibration, and causes the viewfinder to \\"black out\\". The camera also must have a slight delay between when the shutter release button is pressed, and when the shutter actually opens to allow time for the mirror to move. Quiet operation, low vibration, absence of blackout, and fast response are features usually associated with rangefinder cameras, as these cameras have no mirror reflex system between the lens and the film. A pellicle mirror, such as the one in the EOS RT, always reflects some of the light up to the viewfinder, and allows the rest to pass to the film plane. Therefore, the mirror does not need to move when a picture is taken. Having an uninterrupted view through the finder is especially helpful when trying to pan the camera and keep moving objects in the viewfinder, or during sports photography. Although the viewfinder does not blackout, it can however go very dim as the lens stops down to the taking aperture, so this advantage is greater at wider apertures. A disadvantage of a pellicle mirror is that the light diverted to the viewfinder means less light is available to expose the film ‚Äî in the case of the EOS RT, the lens effectively loses 2/3 of a t-stop. A less reflective mirror might be used, but then the viewfinder would be darker and harder to use. The advantages of a stationary mirror are less important now that modern cameras can move the mirror back and forth very quickly, reducing the shutter release lag and increasing the amount of time the viewfinder is usable. Cameras such as the Canon EOS-1D and Canon EOS-1D Mark II are able to take 8+ frames per second while moving the mirror back and forth, which is very close to the 10 frame per second rate of the pellicle mirror-equipped 1N RS. The EOS-1v with PB-E2 power booster (2000 release) and the EOS-1D Mark III are capable of sustaining 10 frames per second burst rates without the use of a pellicle mirror. Finally, the pellicle mirror also degrades lens resolution. Early tests performed by Modern Photography magazine showed that Canon film cameras with conventional mirrors produce sharper images than Canon cameras with a pellicle mirror. Nevertheless, Sony has implemented a very similar technology on its current digital interchangeable-lens DSLR-like camera line, called SLT cameras. ==References== == External links == *CANON EOS FAQ Version 2.4 *EOS RT - Canon Camera Museum *Photography in Malaysia - Canon EOS RT R ","title":"Canon EOS RT"},{"id":"3252655","text":"Springfield Secondary School (abbreviation: SPF or SPFSS) is a secondary school located in Tampines, in the eastern part of Singapore. Students in Springfield are affectionately referred to as Springfielders. The school offers the GCE 'O' Level/'N' Level Course for Springfielders from Sec 1 to Sec 4/5. Currently, the principal of Springfield is Mrs Leong and its vice- principal is Mr Martin Chan(Academic) and Mr Bambang. It has around 980 students and 90 teachers. It has achieved the Sustained Achievement Award in Uniformed Groups twice in 2004 and 2005. Springfield achieved the Niche Programme status for rock-climbing in 2008. With the award, Springfield can admit up to 5% of their Secondary One intake through the Direct School Admission (DSA) exercise, in addition to receiving MOE funding. Springfield is also the first secondary school to have student climbers recognised and certified by the UIAA through a training course and expedition. ==General== The construction of Springfield Secondary School began in 1992. The school was given the name Tampines West Secondary School. The name \\"Springfield\\" was officially adopted on 21 December 1992. Springfield started functioning in 1993 with eight classes at Tampines Secondary School. It then moved to its present site in 1993 and was officially opened by Yatiman Yusof, MP for Tampines GRC, on 15 September 1995. ===Class naming=== As of 2016, classes of Secondary One to Secondary Five are given names of the following set of values: ‚Ä¢ Aspiration ‚Ä¢ Benevolence ‚Ä¢ Compassion ‚Ä¢ Diligence ‚Ä¢ Excellence ‚Ä¢ Fortitude ‚Ä¢ Graciousness ‚Ä¢ Integrity ===School Logo=== The blade of green grass forms the letter \\"S\\". The glowing sun, together with the green grass, forms the letter \\"f\\". The three rows of rich, golden earth provide the foundation. Together, they represent Springfield Secondary School. The grass, sun and earth depict life, energy and growth. the grass is also shaped to represent a hand. ===School Motto=== Better self for better tomorrow ==Springfield's Niche Area of Excellence in Sports Climbing programme== The 15M high Springfield Rockwall/Climbing wall is an outstanding Tampines landmark that has captured the attention of many passing by. Built in 1995, it was one of the first outdoor rockwalls in a secondary school. Over the years, thousands of Springfielders have learnt the basics of sports climbing and many have excelled in the sport. The emphasis of the Sports climbing programme was not just about skills but also on safety and the proper use and maintaining the integrity of equipment. Sports climbing has indeed toughened up Springfielders. Sports climbing has developed mental strength and inculcated qualities such as integrity, resilience and perseverance. Springfield shares the use of her Rockwall and expertise with the community as well. Springfield have hosted various groups from the Tampines constituency sports club, handicapped organisations such as the visually handicapped, hospital help- groups and the deaf. Springfield rockwall has often been used by other schools, the National University of Singapore and the Nanyang Technological University, and uniformed group organisations such as the Boys‚Äô Brigade, Salvation Army and The Singapore Mountaineering Federation. The popularity and success of Springfield climbing have produced more than 7 National climbers among Springfielders over the last 10 years. These pupils travelled all over the world to represent Singapore in World, Regional and other international competitions. Springfield has won 4 National Championships in the SAFRA National Sports Climbing Championships over the past 9 years and successfully mounted a multi-peak expedition to the Nepal Himalaya in 2000 and recently in 2008. A notable Springfielder, Foo Xiu Guan, is doing Singapore proud in the South-East Asian Circuit as well as the World Youth Championships. The school has been successful in competitions in Sports Climbing through its participation in local Sports Climbing events as well as in School-organised events such as \\"Let's Rock\\". Springfield climbers have been consistently placed in all competitions we have participated in. Of special mention is the excellent achievement during the National Schools Sports Climbing Championship 2008 in which Springfield emerged Overall School Champion and the Asian Youth & National School Sport Climbing Championship from 23 to 25 November 2007. In the Asian Youth segment; a Springfielder, Norameera Bte Mohamed Hussein of Secondary 3G (2007) and Muhammad Hafiz B Latiff of 2F (2007) emerged Champion and 2nd Runner-up in the Speed Climb Category respectively. Springfield were crowned Team Champion in the first ever Speed Team Climbing category in the National School segment. Through the Niche Area of Excellence Programme, Springfield hopes to enhance the culture and development of sports climbing. ==Advanced Elective Modules== Springfield Secondary School will be one of the few schools in the pioneering batch to offer Advanced Elective Modules (AEMs). The school will be collaborating with Temasek Polytechnic to offer elective modules to expand the learning experience of pupils and provide exposure to the practice-oriented learning approaches adopted in the polytechnics. AEMs may be used for polytechnic admission under the Joint Polytechnic Special Admissions Exercise (JPSAE) and the Direct Polytechnic Admission (DPA) exercise.

Merriman won a Young Artist Award for \\"Best Performance in a TV Movie or Special - Leading Young Actor\\" for his role in the film. The film was released on VHS in 2002, followed by a DVD release in 2008. ==Plot== Sally Cambridge is the divorced mother of two sons, 16-year-old Jack and 9-year-old Leo. As the film opens, she is arrested on suspicion of child abuse, and during questioning, she reveals the story of what actually happened, told via flashback. One evening, a call to Jack's basketball coach reveals that he has been given a two-week suspension from the team due to poor grades, which Jack did not tell her. Compounded with the fact that he stayed out past curfew that night, Sally attempts to talk to Jack about his problems, but he angrily orders her out of his bedroom, slightly shoving her in the process. A short time later, while hanging out with his friend Luke, Jack is arrested for shoplifting at the local mall, and when Sally attempts to question him afterwards, he again becomes furious and smashes a glass. She later tries to ask Jack what caused this outburst, but he tells her he doesn't know and tearfully apologizes. Not long afterwards, Sally goes on a date with a colleague named Frank, who is also divorced. While Leo warms up to him immediately, Jack is outright rude when Frank arrives to pick Sally up, and when she reprimands Jack for his behavior, he shouts at her and then pushes her aside. Later that night, Jack receives a phone call from Luke, and although entrusted with watching his little brother, he leaves Leo alone to go to a party. Furious, Sally grounds Jack for a month and takes the phone to call Luke's mother. A confrontation ensues, which soon turns physical, and when Sally slaps Jack in retaliation, he attempts to punch her, but she ducks and he ends up putting his hand through a window, cutting his arm in the process. A couple of nights later, Sally has Frank over for dinner, but Jack is once again rude, and when Sally tries to talk to him afterwards, it escalates into another physical confrontation, which is cut short by a visit from the police. Both Sally and Jack claim that nothing's wrong, which satisfies them, but the next day sees Leo discovering Gus, the family cat, with a broken leg. After he and Sally return home from the vet, she finds Jack crying in his room, apologizing over and over. Realizing her son has a problem, Sally seeks advice at a women's shelter, where a counselor suggests she take out an order of protection against Jack. Though she goes to the police station, Sally changes her mind and instead goes to her ex-husband Brad's office and attempts to explain what happened the night of Jack's \\"accident\\", but Brad blames her for not having control over the situation, and takes custody of the boys. While at Brad's, an argument ensues between Leo and his stepmother Marcia, with Leo taking an angry tone not unlike Jack's. Later that night, Jack decides to go back home and apologize to his mother, but is greeted upon his arrival by the sight of his mother in an embrace with Frank, which sets off another physical confrontation between Jack and Sally. Having followed his brother there, Leo attempts to stop Jack, but gets pushed in the struggle and inadvertently strikes his head as he falls to the floor. After Sally's arrest, she is brought to the hospital to see Leo, where Jack and Brad are waiting; realizing the charges his mother faces, Jack finally owns up to his misdeeds, confessing to the accompanying officers and his father that he was the one responsible for everything. As a result, Sally is released and Jack gets arrested for assault. Although the prosecutor is unwilling to drop the charges against Jack, an offer is made to defer them if Sally and Brad file an at-risk youth petition, which mandates that Jack be placed in a treatment program, during which time he will also be put in temporary foster care, and that his parents undergo individual counseling. Afterwards, Brad takes responsibility for his own anger issues, which Sally points out that their sons have picked up on, and informs him they need to work together to get Jack the help he needs. During his group counseling sessions, Jack comes to understand that his violent outbursts were learned behavior, rooted in the verbal abuse his father often dealt towards his mother, while Sally's individual sessions gives her the opportunity to acknowledge her own father's verbally abusive behavior toward her mother, as well as her own tendency to back down on enforcing discipline in an effort to avoid a verbal showdown, and what she perceives as having failed at her marriage. However, her therapist points out that Sally did not fail at her marriage; she simply couldn't tolerate the verbal abuse from Brad, and getting out of it was the best thing she could have done. After returning home, Jack admits to his mother about having felt relief when Brad left and knowing she felt the same, while Sally acknowledges she had no idea how to make Brad stop behaving the way he did towards her, and Jack adds that he didn't either. The two then embrace, with Jack apologizing to Sally as she assures him that things are going to be OK and they're both getting the help they need. ==External links== * Category:2001 television films Category:2001 films Category:Canadian television films Category:Canadian films Category:English-language films Category:Films about domestic violence ","title":"Dangerous Child"},{"id":"3252696","text":"Peter Thomas (1 December 1925 ‚Äì 17 May 2020) was a German composer and arranger with an active career of more than 50 years. He was known for his TV and film soundtracks such as Raumpatrouille, the Edgar Wallace movies film series, and the Jerry Cotton film series. == Life == Thomas was born in Breslau, Silesia. In the 1950s, he played as a musician for the RIAS broadcaster, typically live. The restored Brandenburg Gate in Berlin was re- opened in 2002 with a live version of the main theme of the Raumpatrouille soundtrack. In his directorial debut, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), actor George Clooney used three tracks of Peter Thomas' music originally composed for Edgar Wallace movies of the 1960s (in their original mono versions). The 1990s avant-garde band Mr. Bungle performed his piece \\"Love In Space\\" on several dates of their 1995/1996 tour for Disco Volante. UK Plunderphonics and avant-garde band, The Perrinormal, name Peter Thomas as one of their main influences, alongside John Barry and Lalo Schifrin. For some of his exceptional scores, Thomas used a self-developed musical instrument called \\"ThoWiephon\\", today being exhibited in the Deutsches Museum in Munich, standing near the famous Theremin, also being used in many movies. According to UCM.ONE, a Movie company currently releasing a movie with the Soundtrack composed by Peter Thomas, he died on 17 May 2020 in Lugano. == Films == * ' (Zur√ºck aus dem Weltall, 1959) * ' (Flucht nach Berlin, 1960) * The Strange Countess (Die seltsame Gr√§fin, 1961) * The Puzzle of the Red Orchid (Das R√§tsel der roten Orchidee, 1961) * Only a Woman (Ich bin auch nur eine Frau, 1962) * The Door with Seven Locks (Die T√ºr mit den sieben Schl√∂ssern, 1962) * ' (Die endlose Nacht, 1963) * An Alibi for Death (Ein Alibi zerbricht, 1963) * The White Spider (Die wei√üe Spinne, 1963) * The Squeaker (Der Zinker, 1963) * The Indian Scarf (Das Indische Tuch, 1963) * Stop Train 349 (Versp√§tung in Marienborn, 1964) * Room 13 (Zimmer 13, 1964) * The Ringer (Der Hexer, 1964) * Traitor's Gate (Das Verr√§tertor, 1964) * Uncle Tom's Cabin (Onkel Toms H√ºtte, 1965) * The Last Tomahawk (Der letzte Mohikaner, 1965) * Tread Softly / Operation Hurricane: Friday Noon (Sch√ºsse aus dem Geigenkasten, 1965) * Manhattan Night of Murder (Mordnacht in Manhattan, 1965) * Winnetou and Old Firehand / Thunder at the Border (Winnetou und sein Freund Old Firehand, 1966 ‚Äì Karl May film) * The Trap Snaps Shut at Midnight (Um null Uhr schnappt die Falle zu, 1966) * ' (Playgirl ‚Äì Berlin ist eine S√ºnde wert, 1966) * The Hunchback of Soho (Der Bucklige von Soho, 1966) * The Trygon Factor (Das Geheimnis der wei√üen Nonne, 1966) * The Blood Demon / Castle of the Walking Dead / Pendulum / The Snake Pit and the Pendulum / The Snake Pit / The Torture Chamber of Dr. Sadism / The Torture Room (Die Schlangengrube und das Pendel, 1967 ‚Äì all titles used for one and the same movie) * Jack of Diamonds (Der Diamantenprinz, 1967) * Murderers Club of Brooklyn (Der M√∂rderclub von Brooklyn, 1967) * The Zombie Walks (Im Banne des Unheimlichen, 1967) * The Hound of Blackwood Castle (Der Hund von Blackwood Castle, 1968) * The Man with the Glass Eye (Der Mann mit dem Glasauge, 1968) * Van de Velde: The Perfect Marriage (Van de Velde: Die vollkommene Ehe, 1968) * Death and Diamonds (Dynamit in gr√ºner Seide, 1968) * The Gorilla of Soho (Der Gorilla von Soho, 1968) * ' (1968, TV miniseries) * Every Night of the Week (Van de Velde: Das Leben zu zweit ‚Äì Sexualit√§t in der Ehe, 1969) * ' (1969, TV film) * ' (O Happy Day, 1970) * ' (1970) * Chariots of the Gods (Erinnerungen an die Zukunft, 1970) * Swedish Sin (Nach Stockholm der Liebe wegen, 1970) * ' (1970) * Holiday Report (1971) * Our Willi Is the Best (Unser Willi ist der Beste, 1971) * The Body in the Thames (Die Tote aus der Themse, 1971) * The Big Boss 1971 (Die Todesfaust des Cheng Li, 1973) * The Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of (Der Stoff, aus dem die Tr√§ume sind, 1972) * Three Men in the Snow (Drei M√§nner im Schnee, 1974) * Embassy of the Gods / Miracle of the Gods (Botschaft der G√∂tter, 1976) * Breakthrough (Steiner ‚Äì Das eiserne Kreuz, 2.

The falls are located just south of the lower portion of Shasta Springs. Access to the falls is via a mile-long hiking trail on the Union Pacific Railroad right of way; the City of Dunsmuir is seeking to finish a safe hiking trail that will include a bridge over the river. California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger took President George H.W. Bush to see the falls. ==Description== Mossbrae Falls is one of the most scenic waterfalls in California. Approximately in height and wide, the falls are fed by springs that course down the canyon wall, and into the Sacramento River, creating the effect of many waterfall streams, two of them especially large, falling into the river. The entire course of the falls is longer than ; however the upper cascades cannot be observed through flora that covers the mountainside. The bottom is a straight plunge into the river. ==Etymology== The waterfall is named for the profusion of moss on the hillside at the site, together with brae, which means \\"a steep bank or hillside\\" in Irish and Scots. ==Access== The trail to the falls from Dunsmuir requires trespassing beside the Union Pacific railroad tracks for , before the waterfall appears on the right immediately before a railroad trestle that crosses the river. The railroad line runs in a cut and in places there is little space to avoid a train; two hikers were injured by trains in the second half of the 2010s. The city of Dunsmuir closed the illegal parking area in the Shasta Retreat neighborhood in 2011, and has since built most of an extension to the Hedge Creek Falls trail that when finished will cross the river on a pedestrian bridge from the falls, but requires Union Pacific's permission to complete it. Alternate means of access are through Mineral Spring Trail and Angel Trail in Shasta Springs, a private property owned by Saint Germain Foundation, and white water rafting from Box Canyon Dam. ==Photos== File:Mossbrea_Falls_All_Sections.JPGAll sections of the waterfalls File:Falls_in_the_Vicinity.JPGOther waterfalls in the vicinity ==References== Category:Mount Shasta Category:Landforms of Siskiyou County, California Category:Waterfalls of California Category:Tourist attractions in Siskiyou County, California ","title":"Mossbrae Falls"},{"id":"3252724","text":"An intuition pump is a thought experiment structured to allow the thinker to use their intuition to develop an answer to a problem. ==In Dennett's work== The term was coined by Daniel Dennett. In Consciousness Explained, he uses the term to describe John Searle's Chinese room thought experiment, characterizing it as designed to elicit intuitive but incorrect answers by formulating the description in such a way that important implications of the experiment would be difficult to imagine and tend to be ignored. In the case of the Chinese room argument, Dennett considers the intuitive notion that a person manipulating symbols seems inadequate to constitute any form of consciousness, and says that this notion ignores the requirements of memory, recall, emotion, world knowledge, and rationality that the system would actually need to pass such a test. \\"Searle does not deny that programs can have all this structure, of course\\", Dennett says. \\"He simply discourages us from attending to it. But if we are to do a good job imagining the case, we are not only entitled but obliged to imagine that the program Searle is hand-simulating has all this structure‚Äîand more, if only we can imagine it. But then it is no longer obvious, I trust, that there is no genuine understanding of the joke going on.\\" In his 1984 book Elbow Room, Dennett used the term in a positive sense to describe thought experiments which facilitate the understanding of or reasoning about complex subjects by harnessing intuition: == In other scholarship == Dorbolo defines intuition pumps as thought experiments designed to \\"transform\\" thinking in their audience, as opposed simply to posing a philosophical problem. The distinction between intuition pumps and thought experiments in general is not entirely clear, however; some writers use the two terms synonymously. Brendel goes further, distinguishing \\"bad\\" intuition pumps that discourage considered reflection from \\"legitimate\\" thought experiments permissible in philosophical argument. Dowe suggests that intuition pumps constitute a middle ground between Moorean facts, or propositions that are so obviously true that they refute arguments to the contrary; and conceptual analysis. ==See also== * Consciousness * Philosophy of mind ==References== == Sources == * * ==External links== * * Dennett, D.

The reaction was named after Karl Wilhelm Rosenmund, who first reported it in 1918. The Rosenmund reduction The reaction, a hydrogenolysis, is catalysed by palladium on barium sulfate, which is sometimes called the Rosenmund catalyst. Barium sulfate has a low surface area which reduces the activity of the palladium, preventing over-reduction. However, for certain reactive acyl chlorides the activity must be reduced further, by the addition of a poison. Originally this was thioquinanthrene although thiourea has also been used. Deactivation is required because the system must reduce the acyl chloride but not the subsequent aldehyde. If further reduction does take place it will create a primary alcohol which would then react with the remaining acyl chloride to form an ester. Rosenmund catalyst can be prepared by reduction of palladium(II) chloride solution in the presence of BaSO4. Typical reducing agent is formaldehyde. While Rosenmund reduction method can be used to prepare several aldehydes, formaldehyde cannot be prepared, as formyl chloride is unstable at room temperatures. ==See also== * Lindlar catalyst - Palladium on calcium carbonate with added catalytic poison, similar to the Rosenmund catalyst * Rosenmund‚Äìvon Braun reaction - Another reaction named after Karl Wilhelm Rosenmund in which an aryl halide is converted into an aryl nitrile * Grundmann aldehyde synthesis - Also reduces an acyl halide to an aldehyde, via the use of diazomethane * Diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBALH) can also reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes. * Gattermann‚ÄìKoch reaction - A reaction which produces an aldehyde via an intermediate acyl chloride ==References== ==Further reading== * * Category:Organic redox reactions Category:Name reactions ","title":"Rosenmund reduction"},{"id":"3252743","text":"This article lists national heads of government and heads of state who held an active military rank while in office.

It was based on a 1998 novel of the same name by Elliot Perlman. It won the 2005 Australian Film Institute Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. ==Plot== The film and book tell the story of Eddie (David Wenham), a principled man with a seemingly stable and happy life. He has a wife, the academic Tanya (Frances O'Connor), a daughter, Abby (Joanna Hunt-Prokhovnik), is paying off a house and has a job as a government land assessor. Yet when the forces of economic and social change threaten this, he realises just how fragile his reality and security is. After losing his job, he checks his bank balance and realises he has only the 'three dollars' of the title to his name. Eddie's life also becomes entwined with that of childhood friend Amanda (Sarah Wynter), whom he unfailingly runs into every nine-and-a-half years, and every time he has just three dollars. The novel and film are set largely in Melbourne, at a time when the policies of economic liberalisation were gaining credence in Australian politics and were arguably affecting many lives similarly to Eddie and Tanya. They explore the choices we make between what we have and what might be. ==Reception== The film has received better reviews in Australia and New Zealand than in the United States. Generally, performances, cinematography, and observational details received praise, while direction and story flow received criticism. In New Zealand, The Lumiere Reader gave the film 5/5 stars as an \\"engaging and accessible film which gives the audience plenty to mull over. The cast all bring their roles to life in a fresh, believable fashion and the direction, whilst smart, is not overtly in your face.\\"Powell, Jacob (23 March 2006). Three Dollars. Review at The Lumiere Reader. Retrieved 12 August 2010. On the Australian At The Movies Margaret Pomeranz gave the film 3.5/5 and David Stratton gave 4.5/5 stars. TripleJ's Megan Spencer gave the film 4/5 stars, describing the film as \\"an authentic, intelligent and entertaining snapshot of contemporary middle class life,\\" and, \\"it does have flaws, however: the key plot device of meeting Amanda over time amounts to...not very much. The ethical dilemma Eddie faces at work is dropped like a hot potato and there were some superfluous scenes that could have easily been trimmed from the cut, which would have made dramatically stronger.\\"Spencer, Megan (22 April 2005). Three Dollars. Review at triplej; ABC.net.au. Andrew Urban of Australia's Urban Cinefile wrote: \\"Three Dollars is such a strange film I am tempted to read the novel [...] to see if the tantalising episodes of Eddie's life captured here find some cohesion through the inner voice of literature. The cinematic arts of the film are beyond doubt: Robert Connolly is a natural master of film, and he makes this a fascinating work, filled with little treasures of observation, performance and technique.\\" Louise Keller wrote, \\"Wenham is excellent as always,\\" and \\"there's plenty to relate to in Three Dollars, and the moments, like domestic squabbles about whether dinner is a casserole or a stew, ring very true. But at nearly two hours, the film feels overlong.\\"Urban, Andrew; Keller, Louise (2005). Three Dollars. Reviews at Urbancinefile.com.au. Retrieved 12 August 2010. The film received some mild recommendations, and some harshly negative reviews in the United States. Variety found the film dark, but \\"far from humorless. An intimate drama of a family man recalling happier times while contemplating a bleak future, this adaptation of Elliot Perlman's 1998 novel shifts uneasily at times around weighty themes, but its essential humanism still strikes chords.\\"Kuipers, Richard (20 April 2005).

This sense of the term is not identical with the more general usage of military front which indicates a geographic area in wartime, although a Soviet Front may operate within designated boundaries. The Transcaucasus Front describes two distinct organizations during the war. == First creation == The first version was created on August 23, 1941 from the Transcaucasus Military District, which was originally formed in 1922. The boundary of the Front extended along the border with Turkey and along the Black Sea coast from Batumi to Tuapse. It was commanded by Lieutenant-General Dmitry Kozlov from August 1941 to December 1941. On June 22, 1941, when the German invasion started, the Transcaucasus Military District included the 3rd, 24th, and 40th Rifle Corps, the 28th Mechanised Corps, two cavalry divisions (the 17th Mountain and the 24th) and three separate rifle divisions (the 63rd, 76th, and 77th).Orbat.com/Niehorster, Administrative Order of Battle, Transcaucasus Military District, 22 June 1941 Also part of the District were three fortified regions and District troops, which included artillery and NKVD frontier units. The initial Front organization incorporated the four Soviet armies stationed in the district in June 1941: * the 45th and 46th on the border with Turkey and * the 44th and 47th on the border with Iran. On August 25, 1941 troops from the Front entered Iran according to the Soviet-Iran Treaty of Friendship of February 21, 1921, which eliminated the direct threat to the Baku oil fields. ===Order of Battle, Invasion of Iran, 1941=== Here is the Soviet OOB for the 25th of August 1941:The Forum of the 1.Jagdmoroner Abteilung 44th Army (Major General Alexander Khadeyev) *20th Mountain Rifle Division *77th Mountain Rifle Division *17th Cavalry Division *24th Tank Regiment 47th Army (Major General Vasily Novikov) *63rd Mountain Rifle Division *76th Mountain Rifle Division *236th Rifle Division *6th Tank Division *54th Tank Division *13th Motorcycle Regiment 53rd Army (Major General Sergei Trofimenko) (invaded Iran from Turkmenistan, Turkestan Military District on the 27th of August) *58th Rifle Corps *83rd Mountain Rifle Division *4th Cavalry Corps In November 1941, the 51st Army joined the front after being evacuated from the Crimea. The Transcaucasus Front was renamed the Caucasus Front on December 30, 1941. == Second creation== The second version of this front was again created from the Transcaucasus Military District on May 15, 1942 and continued in existence until its reorganization as the Tbilisi Military District on August 25, 1945 after the end of the war. It was commanded by General Ivan V. Tyulenev (05.1942 - 08.1945), and included the 4th and 58th Armies at various periods. ==References== Category:Soviet fronts Category:History of the Caucasus under the Soviet Union ","title":"Transcaucasian Front"},{"id":"3252760","text":"Vasudev Balwant Phadke (4 November 1845 ‚Äì 17 February 1883) was an Indian independence activist and revolutionary who sought India's independence from the British Raj. Phadke was moved by the plight of the farming community and believed that Swaraj was the only remedy for their ills. With the help of the Koli, Bhil and Dhangar communities in the region, he formed a revolutionary group of the Ramoshi people. The group started an armed struggle to overthrow the British Raj, launching raids on rich English businessmen to obtain funds for the purpose. Phadke came to prominence when he got control of the city of Pune for a few days after catching British soldiers off-guard during one a surprise attack. ==Early years== Vasudev Balwant Phadke house at Shirdhon village Phadke was born on 4 November 1845 in Shirdhon village of Panvel taluka, now in Raigad district, Maharashtra. As a child, he preferred learning skills like wrestling, riding over high school education and dropped out of school. Eventually he moved to Pune and took the job as a clerk with military accounts department in Pune for 15 years. Krantiveer Lahuji Vastad Salve a then prominent social figure based in Pune was his mentor. Salve, an expert wrestler, operated a TALIM (training center for wrestling). Salve preached the importance of independence from British Raj. Salve belonged to the Mang community, an untouchable community, taught Phadke the importance of getting backward castes into mainstream freedom movement. It was during this period that Phadke began attending lectures by Mahadeo Govind Ranade which mainly focused on how the British Raj policies hurt the Indian economy. Phadke was deeply hurt by how this was leading to widespread suffering in the society. In 1870, he joined a public agitation in Pune that was aimed at addressing people's grievances. Phadke founded an institution, the Aikya Vardhini Sabha, to educate the youth. While working as clerk, he was not able to see his dying mother due to the delay in approval of his leave. This incident enraged Phadke and was to be the turning point in his life. ===Co-founding of Maharashtra Education Society=== Phadke was one the earliest person graduate from a British established institution in Bombay presidency. In 1860, along with fellow social reformers and revolutionaries Laxman Narhar Indapurkar and Waman Prabhakar Bhave, Phadke co-founded the Poona Native Institution (PNI) which was later renamed as the Maharashtra Education Society (MES). Through the PNI, he went on set up Bhave School in Pune. Today, the MES runs over 77 institutions in various parts of Maharashtra. ==Rebellion== In 1875, after the then Gaekwad ruler of Baroda was deposed by the British, Phadke launched protest speeches against the government. Severe famine coupled with the evident apathy of the British administration propelled him to tour the Deccan region, urging people to strive for a free republic. Unable to get support from the educated classes, he gathered a band of people from the Ramoshi caste. People from the Kolis, Bhils and Dhangars were also included later. He taught himself to shoot, ride and fence. He organised around 300 men into an insurgent group that aimed at liberating India from British rule. Phadke intended to build an army of own but lacking funds they decided to break into government treasuries. The first raid was done in a village called Dhamari in Shirur taluka in Pune district. The income tax which was collected for British Raj was kept in the house of local business man Balchand Fojmal Sankla. They attacked the house and took the money for the benefit of famine stricken villagers. There they collected about four hundred rupees but this led to his being branded as a dacoit. To save himself Phadke had to flee from village to village, sheltered by his sympathisers and well-wishers, mostly the lower class of the society. Impressed by his zeal and determination, the villagers of Nanagaum offered him protection and cover in the local forest. The general plot would be to cut off all the communications of British forces and then raid the treasury. The main purpose of these raids was to feed famine-affected farmer communities. Phadke performed many such raids in areas near Shirur and Khed talukas in Pune. Meanwhile, the leader of Ramoshi, Daulatrav Naik, who was the main supporter of Phadke, headed towards the Konkan area on the western coast. On 10‚Äì11 May 1879, they raided Palaspe and Chikhali, looting around 1.5 lakh rupees. While returning towards Ghat Matha, Major Daniel attacked Naik, who was shot dead. His death was a setback to Phadke's revolt: the loss of support forced him to move south to the Shri Shaila Mallikarjun shrine. Later, Phadke recruited about 500 Rohilas to begin a fresh fight. ==Capture and death== Phadke's plans to organise several simultaneous attacks against the British Raj nationwide were met with very limited success. He once had a direct engagement with the British army in the village of Ghanur, whereafter the government offered a bounty for his capture. Not to be outdone, Phadke in turned offered a bounty for the capture of the Governor of Bombay, announced a reward for the killing of each European, and issued other threats to the government. He then fled to Hyderabad State to recruit Rohilla and Arabs into his organisation. A British Major, Henry William Daniell and Abdul Haque, Police Commissioner to the Nizam of Hyderabad, pursued the fleeing Phadke day and night. The British move to offer a bounty for his capture met with success: someone betrayed Phadke, and he was captured in a temple after a fierce fight at the district of Kaladgi on 20 July 1879 while he was on his way to Pandharpur. From here he was taken to Pune for trial. Ganesh Vasudeo Joshi, also known as Sarvajanik Kaka, defended his case. Phadke and his comrades were housed in the district session court jail building, near Sangam bridge, which now happens to be the state C.I.D. building. His own diary provided evidence to have him sentenced for life. Phadke was transported to jail at Aden, but escaped from the prison by taking the door off from its hinges on 13 February 1883. He was soon recaptured and then went on a hunger strike, dying on 17 February 1883. ==Recognition== Phadke on a 1984 stamp of India Phadke became known as the father of the Indian armed rebellion in that he provided the inspiration for fellow freedom fighters. Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay's patriotic novel Anand Math incorporated various contemporary acts of patriotism performed by Phadke during his freedom struggle. As the British government did not like this, Bankim had to print up to five editions of the book to tone down these stories. In 1984, the Indian Postal Service issued a 50 paise stamp in honour of Phadke.Vasudeo Balwant Phadke. Indianpost.com (21 February 1984). Retrieved on 2018-12-11.

The group became known as The Tennessee Three in 1960, with the addition of drummer W. S. Holland. Grant also served as road manager for Cash and his touring show company. ==Early life== Grant was raised in Bessemer City, North Carolina. He was one of twelve children born of Willie Leander (1888‚Äì1968) and Mary Elizabeth (Simmonds) Grant (1895‚Äì1965). His siblings are Wade (1910‚Äì1985), Olson (1912‚Äì1993), Burlas (1914‚Äì1915), Vernal (1916‚Äì1971), Eulean (1918‚Äì2012), Hershel (1921‚Äì2014), Doris (1923‚Äì2006), Odell (1925‚Äì2011), Ed (1931‚Äì2012), Norma Jean (b. 1935) and Aubrey Grant (b. 1937). Grant married Etta May Dickerson on November 9, 1946. They had one son, Randy. Grant and his wife settled in Memphis, Tennessee in 1947. Grant worked as a mechanic; first for Wagner Brake Service, then C.M. Booth Motor Company, and later, Automobile Sales Company in Memphis. It was during this time that he met fellow Automobile Sales employees Luther Perkins and Roy Cash, Sr., older brother of Johnny Cash. When the younger Cash returned to Memphis after serving in the U.S. Air Force, Grant, Perkins and Cash began playing together as three rhythm guitarists, along with another Automobile Sales co-worker and steel guitar player, A.W. \\"Red\\" Kernodle. Grant was a self-taught musician, learning to play the bass after the group collectively decided that Grant should switch to playing bass, and that Perkins would play lead guitar. During the formation of this group, Cash used Grant's Martin guitar for performances, and for many years thereafter, for songwriting. Grant was an important part of the trademark 'boom-chicka-boom' sound of Johnny Cash that would change the sound of country music. He recorded with Cash from 1954 until 1980. Grant also voluntarily took on the responsibilities of road manager for Cash's touring show. During his career with Cash, Grant played Epiphone upright basses and electric basses by Fender, Epiphone and Micro-Frets. On the album cover for Johnny Cash At San Quentin, Grant's Epiphone Newport bass is famously featured in the foreground. In the early 1970s, he briefly endorsed Micro-Frets instruments and Sunn amplifiers. ==Legal troubles with Cash== Cash's recurring drug problems eventually led to issues that resulted in Grant being fired by Cash. It was at this time that Grant discovered that Cash had embezzled retirement funds set aside for Grant and Luther Perkins. In 1980, Grant filed suit against Cash for wrongful dismissal and for embezzlement of retirement funds. A lawsuit against Cash for slander was also considered. In coincidental action, Luther Perkins' daughters from his first marriage filed suit against Cash for embezzlement of retirement funds. Both lawsuits were eventually settled out-of-court. Despite the bitter legal battles, the two men later reconciled. Grant contends that he was probably Cash's closest and most trusted friend; indeed, he played a critical role in helping Cash along when Cash's drug problems threatened his career and his life. Grant made a final appearance onstage with Cash in 1999 as an original member of The Tennessee Two. ==Later career== Following his career with Cash, Grant managed the Statler Brothers until their retirement in 2002. He last lived in Hernando, Mississippi, with his wife. Grant's autobiographical book I Was There When It Happened: My Life With Johnny Cash was published in October 2006. It is a behind-the-scenes story of their beginnings and rise to fame. He \\"laid down [his] bass for the last time\\" at the Brooks Museum in Memphis, Tennessee, in August 2010. \\"Etta's Tune\\" included on Rosanne Cash's 2014 album, The River and the Thread, is dedicated to Grant and his wife. ==Powerboat Racing== For many years, Grant owned and raced outboard powerboats. His teams included notable drivers such as Dick Pond, Charlie Bailey and Billy Seebold. Often, members of the Johnny Cash band would work in Grant's pit crews. Grant's distinctive boats were most appropriately given such names as \\"Ring of Fire\\" and \\"A Boat Named Sue\\" among others of his personal musical references. ==Walk The Line== Marshall Grant is played by Larry Bagby in the 2005 film, Walk the Line ==Death== Marshall Grant died at the age of 83 on August 7, 2011 while in Jonesboro, Arkansas attending a festival to restore the childhood home of Johnny Cash. ==References== Category:1928 births Category:2011 deaths Category:People from Bryson City, North Carolina Category:American double- bassists Category:Male double-bassists Category:Sun Records artists Category:American country bass guitarists Category:American male bass guitarists Category:Johnny Cash Category:People from Hernando, Mississippi Category:Slap bassists (double bass) Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:People from Bessemer City, North Carolina ","title":"Marshall Grant"},{"id":"3252819","text":"Mary Schneider AM, (born 25 October 1932) is an Australian singer, songwriter and performer, who is a master at the classic Swiss Alpine style, she is best known for yodelling the works of various standards by many a classic composer.

After graduating from the Riga Technical University, Abakanowicz passed his habilitation and began an assistantship at the Technical University of Lw√≥w. In 1881, he moved to France where he purchased a villa in Parc St. Maur on the outskirts of Paris. Earlier he invented the integraph, a form of the integrator, which was patented in 1880, and was henceforth produced by the Swiss firm Coradi. Among his other patents were the parabolagraph, the spirograph, the electric bell used in trains, and an electric arc lamp of his own design. Abakanowicz published several works, including works on statistics, integrators and numerous popular scientific works, such as one describing his integraph. He was also hired by the French government as an expert on electrification and was the main engineer behind the electrification of, among other places, the city of Lyon. His patents allowed him to become a wealthy man and made him receive the Legion d'Honneur in 1889. The Ch√¢teau de Costa√©r√®s Around that time he retired to a small island in Tr√©gastel, off the coast of Brittany, where between 1892 and 1896 he erected a neo-Gothic manor. Although the construction works were not finished in Abakanowicz's lifetime, the castle of Costa√©r√®s became a notable centre of Polish emigree culture, housing many notable artists, scientists and politicians. Among frequent guests of Abakanowicz were Aleksander Gierymski, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Mickiewicz, Leon Wycz√≥≈Çkowski and Henryk Sienkiewicz. The latter became the closest friend of Abakanowicz. It was in Abakanowicz's villa in Parc St. Maur that he finished his The Teutonic Knights and The Polaniecki Family, while the Quo Vadis novel, one of the works for which Sienkiewicz was awarded with the Nobel Prize, was written entirely in Abakanowicz's manor. Bruno Abakanowicz died suddenly on 29 August 1900. In his will, he made Sienkiewicz the tutor of his sole daughter Zofia, who later graduated from the London School of Economics and the Sorbonne and was murdered during World War II at the Auschwitz concentration camp. As for Abakanowicz's nationality, he was born in the lands which were once part of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. Some later documents refer to him as a Russian because at the time of his birth, Ukmergƒó was part of the Russian Empire. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica calls him a Lithuanian mathematician in its article on the integraph. Others consider him a Pole due to his fluent command of the language, friendship with many leading Polish personalities of the time, and literary contributions in Polish. His surname Abakanowicz which has Lipka Tatar roots goes back to the szlachta of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth under the Abdank coat of arms.A.

He was hated by the Scots and did not seem well liked even by the English. He was an adviser to John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. He suggested a full-scale attack across the bridge, which cost the English the battle and led to his death. ==Life== Cressingham was a son of William de Cressingham. Hugh was a clerk and one of the officers of the English exchequer, was employed in a matter arising from some wrongs done to the abbot of Ramsey in 1282; he was attached to the household of Eleanor of Castile, queen of Edward I, was her steward, and one of her bailiffs for the barony of Haverford. In 1292 the king employed him to audit the debts due to his late father, Henry III, and in that and during the next three years he was the head of the justices itinerant for the northern counties. He was presented to the parsonage of Chalk, Kent, by the prior and convent of Norwich, and held the rectory of Doddington in the same county (Hasted); he was also rector of ‚ÄòRuddeby‚Äô (Rudby in Cleveland), and held prebends in several churches (Hemingburgh). In 1296 Edward appointed Cressingham treasurer of the kingdom, charging him to spare no expense necessary for the complete reduction of Scotland. Cressingham was killed during the Battle of Stirling Bridge on 11 September 1297. According to legend, his body was flayed by the Scots as he had flayed Scottish war prisoners, and William Wallace made a sword belt out of his skin.

Nelson, (Los Angeles Times, May 22, 2011) was an American railroad photographer, often called the \\"Ansel Adams of railroad photography.\\" His work has been published in Trains Magazine, Railfan, Locomotive and Railway Preservation, and Vintage Rail, and more than seventy books. He lived in Sacramento, California. A pioneer in railroad photography, Steinheimer lived through and documented the railroads' heyday and their transition to diesel motive power from steam. He is one of very few photographers who appreciated the aesthetics of all locomotives, from steam engines to the latest diesel- powered behemoths. He had a particular fondness for the landscape of the American West, and many of his images situate trains in the larger geography and culture of the time. Known for taking pictures at night, in bad weather, and from risky perches on top of moving trains, Steinheimer had an enormous creativity and productivity. His photograph, \\"Southern Pacific steam helper at Saugus, California, 1947,\\" was included in the Center for Railroad Photography and Art's 20 Memorable Railroad Photographs of the 20th Century. == Early life and later career == Richard Steinheimer was born in Chicago in 1929. His parents divorced in 1935, and he, with his mother and sister, moved to Phoenix, Arizona. It was this trip that first exposed him to trains. In 1939 his family moved to Glendale, California. The Southern Pacific main line was adjacent to his home. In 1945 he started his photographic career with a Kodak Baby Brownie, shooting wartime traffic in the common ¬æ \\"wedgies\\" style. Also in 1945 he received two books by Lucius Beebe, Highball and High Iron, from which he drew inspiration. By 1946 his photos had evolved into more of an experimental style. In 1946 he began using an Argus A-2 camera, and in 1947 he started using a 3¬º√ó4¬º Speed Graphic. With the Speed Graphic now in hand, the flood gates were opened for the creation of some of the best night photos of railroads ever taken. He used yard lights, flashbulbs or whatever lights were available. His night work predates O. Winston Link's by almost seven years. By 1949 he was going to San Francisco City College and one of his teachers was Joe Rosenthal. From 1956 through 1962 he worked for the Marin Independent Journal as a photojournalist. Kalmbach Publishing produced in 1963 his Backwoods Railroad of the West. Although it failed commercially at the time, it would one day become one of the most sought after railroad books in history. From 1948 through 2001 Trains Magazine published over 400 of his photographs. Steinheimer has become recognized as one of the masters of railroad photography, especially across the Western USA, but also pursued a lesser-known career in commercial photography. His specialties included the use of telephoto lenses in railroad scenes, and a devotion to Southern Pacific's Donner Pass crossing of the Sierra Nevada. In 2000 Steinheimer was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease; he suffered a stroke in late of September 2007. He was cared for throughout his illness by his wife Shirley Burman. Richard Steinheimer died on May 4, 2011. An exhibition featuring many of his iconic images is being held at the Robert Mann Gallery in Manhattan, December 15, 2011 through January 21, 2012. == References == * Richard Steinheimer (photographs) and Jeff Brouws (text), A Passion for Trains: The Railroad Photography of Richard Steinheimer, W.

The North Caucasus Front describes either of two distinct organizations during the war. == First Creation == The first formation was created on May 20, 1942 and was commanded by Marshal Semyon M. Budenny throughout its existence. The Front incorporated forces from the (disbanded) Crimean Front and received additional forces from the (disbanded) Southern Front on July 28, 1942. The Front was composed of * 44th Soviet Army (Andrei Khryashchev and Ivan Yefimovich Petrov), * 47th Soviet Army (Grigory Kotov), * 51st Soviet Army (Nikolai Kirichenko and Trofim Kolomiets). The 1st Rifle Corps reappeared in the Soviet OOB on 1 June 1942, directly subordinated to the North Caucasus Front, and was made up of four rifle brigades. The North Caucasus Front at different times also included the 9th, 12th, 18th, 24th, 37th, 56th Army, 4th and 5th Air Army. The Front also had operational control over * the Sevastopol Defence Region, * the Separate Coastal Army (Ivan Yefimovich Petrov), * the Black Sea Fleet, * the Azov Flotilla. The task of the North Caucasus Front was to keep the Sevastopol defensive area and to defend the border of the Don River and the coasts of the Black and Azov Seas. The isolated city of Sebastopol fell on July 4, 1942. From July 25 to August 5, 1942, the front troops fought heavy defensive battles in the lower reaches of the Don, and then in the Stavropol and Krasnodar area's. In August‚ÄìSeptember 1942, the front troops conducted the Armavir-Maikop and Novorossiysk operations, but were unable to prevent the enemy from breaking in the Caucasus along the Black Sea. On September 1, 1942 the Front was reorganized as the Black Sea Group of Forces and assigned to the Transcaucasian Front during the German occupation of the Krasnodar Krai. == Second Creation == The front from December 1942 to February 1943. The second formation of this Front was created on January 24, 1943 from the Northern Group of Forces in the Transcaucasian Front (located in the eastern Caucasus), and reintegrated the Black Sea Group of Forces on February 5, 1943. Lieutenant General Ivan Maslennikov, who was promoted to Colonel General in January 1943, initially took command. He handed over to Lieutenant General Ivan E. Petrov (), in May 1943, and Petrov was then promoted to Colonel General in August. During the long series of engagements known as the Battle of the Caucasus, the North Caucasian Front included the * Black Sea Group of Forces consisting of the **46th Army (Konstantin Leselidze), **18th Army (Alexander Ryzhov), **47th Army (Fyodor Kamkov), **56th Army (Andrei Grechko), **5th Air Army (Sergei Goryunov), **13th Separate Rifle Corps **16th Separate Rifle Corps. *The Northern Group of Forces commanded the ** 37th Army (Pyotr Kozlov, ** 9th Army (Konstantin Koroteev), ** 58th Army (Kondrat Melnik), ** 44th Army (Vasily Khomenko), ** 4th Air Army (Nikolai Naumenko), ** 10th Separate Rifle Corps. Additionally it commanded the Black Sea Fleet and the Baku Army of PVO. The fighting remained reasonably static from February until September 1943 when the Germans ordered fresh withdrawals from the Kuban bridgehead, which effectively ended the period of fighting in the Caucasus. The Front was reorganized into the Separate Coastal Army on November 20, 1943 during the Kerch-Eltigen Operation, the Soviet amphibious crossing of the Sea of Azov. ==Sources== *Kursk Order of Battle * This is a translation of an article in the Russian Wikipedia, –°–µ–≤–µ—Ä–æ-–ö–∞–≤–∫–∞–∑—Å–∫–∏–π —Ñ—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç Category:Soviet fronts ","title":"North Caucasian Front"},{"id":"3252841","text":"Marshall Goodwin Simms Hodgson (April 11, 1922 ‚Äì June 10, 1968), was an Islamic studies academic and a world historian at the University of Chicago. He was chairman of the interdisciplinary Committee on Social Thought in Chicago. ==Works== Though he did not publish extensively during his lifetime, he has become arguably the most influential American historian of Islam due to his three-volume The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization, which The University of Chicago Press, in collaboration with Reuben Smith and other colleagues, published after his death. The work is recognized as a masterpiece that radically reconfigured the academic study of Islam.Albert Hourani, \\"[Review of] The Venture of Islam‚Ä¶, Journal of Near Eastern Studies vol. 37, 1978; pp53-62. Hodgson is also recognized for his work on world history, which was rediscovered and subsequently published under the editorship of Edmund Burke III. In The Venture of Islam, Hodgson positioned Islam as a spiritual endeavor with a profound moral vision--on par with other world religions. He also reimagined the terminology of Islamic history and religion, coining terms like Islamdom (playing off \\"Christendom\\"). Hodgson also resituated the geographical locus of Islam; he shifted attention away from an exclusive focus on Arab Islam that had characterized the Euro- American study of the religion to include the Persianate society (his coinage), which shaped Muslim thought and practice from the Middle Period onward. Hodgson's writings were a precursor to the modern world history approach. His initial motivation in writing a world history was his desire to place Islamic history in a wider context and his dissatisfaction with the prevailing Eurocentrism and Orientalism of his day. Hodgson painted a global picture of world history, in which the \\"Rise of Europe\\" was the end-product of millennia-long evolutionary developments in Eurasian society; modernity could conceivably have originated somewhere else. Indeed, he accepted that China in the twelfth century was close to an industrial revolution, a development that was derailed, perhaps, by the Mongol onslaught in the thirteenth century: :\\"Occidental development had come ultimately from China, as did apparently, the idea of a civil service examination system, introduced in the eighteenth century. In such ways the Occident seems to have been the unconscious heir of the abortive industrial revolution of Sung China\\" Marshall G. S. Hodgson Rethinking World History: Essays on Europe, Islam and World History (Cambridge 1993), p.68. Hodgson denied original western exceptionalism and moved the divergence of Europe forward‚Äîfrom the Renaissance in the fourteenth century to the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century. His explanations for the divergence are rooted in the idea of a 'great Western Transmutation.' This is not to be confused with the Industrial Revolution, as it includes variables more diverse than just industry. Hodgson posited that all the societal elements (industry, banking, health care, police, etc.) of Western European nations became so advanced (or 'technicalized') and co-dependent that those societies were able to determine their own rate of progress. The two most important influences on Hodgson‚Äôs thought were the French orientalist and priest Louis Massignon and the eighteenth-century American Quaker, John Woolman. From the former he learned empathy and respect for Islam, while the latter represented a critical view of Eurocentrism and an embodiment of Hodgson‚Äôs own Quaker conscience.Burke, III, Edmund in Hodgson, G.S.

V√°ri began his athletic career with modern pentathlon but later switched to water polo. He made his debut for the Hungarian national team in 1997. Attila's back hand shot from ten meters in the 2000 Olympic finals against Russia was probably the most unexpected and spectacular goal anyone ever scored in an Olympic final game in water polo. V√°ri was elected into the presidium of the Hungarian Olympic Committee (MOB) in May 2017. He was elected President of the Hungarian Water Polo Federation (MVLSZ) in September 2018, replacing D√©nes Kem√©ny. The ruling party Fidesz‚ÄìKDNP nominated V√°ri as their candidate for the position of Mayor of P√©cs in the 2019 Hungarian local elections, but was defeated by the opposition's joint candidate Attila P√©terffy. ==Honours== ===National=== * Olympic Games: 15px Gold medal - 2000, 2004 * World Championships: 15px Gold medal - 2003; 15px Silver medal - 1998, 2005 * European Championship: 15px Gold medal - 1997, 1999; 15px Bronze medal - 2001, 2003 * FINA World League: 15px Gold medal - 2003, 2004; 15px Silver medal - 2005; 15px Bronze medal - 2002 * FINA World Cup: 15px Gold medal - 1999; 15px Silver medal - 2002; 15px Bronze medal - 1997 * Universiade: (Silver medal - 1995) * Junior World Championships: (Gold medal - 1995) * Junior European Championship: (Gold medal - 1994) ===Club=== * Euroleague Winners (1): (2004 - with Bp.

He served as a major general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War, postbellum three-term United States Senator, and a major general in the United States Army during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. ==Early life and career== Butler was born at Eagle's Crag near Greenville, South Carolina, to a large and prominent family of politicians and military men.Boyd, p. 67. His grandfather was U.S. Congressman William Butler. His mother, Jane Tweedy Perry of Rhode Island, was the sister of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry and Matthew Calbraith Perry, for whom Matthew Calbraith Butler is named. His father, William Butler, Jr., was a Congressman beginning in 1841.Hess, p. 649. His uncle Andrew Butler was a U.S. Senator from South Carolina and uncle Pierce Mason Butler was Governor of South Carolina. One of Matthew Butler's first cousins was Congressman Preston Brooks, who assaulted Senator Charles Sumner in 1856 on the floor of the U.S. Senate with a cane. He said it was because Sumner had insulted Senator Andrew Butler, at whose home Matthew lived as a young man.Martin, p. 8. Two of Butler's first cousins twice removed were James Bonham (killed at the Battle of the Alamo) and Confederate General Milledge Luke Bonham.Burton, pp. 66‚Äì67. In 1848 Butler went with his father to Arkansas but returned in 1851 to live with his uncle, who resided in Edgefield, South Carolina. He received his initial education in the city's Edgefield Academy, and then attended the South Carolina College, where he was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity, graduating in 1856. He studied law, was admitted to the state's bar association in 1857, and began practicing as a lawyer in Edgefield.Wakelyn, p. 119. He was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1860, but resigned in 1861 when the American Civil War began.Martin, pp. 11‚Äì12. ==Marriage and family== On February 25, 1858, Butler married Maria Calhoun Pickens. She was the daughter of Francis Wilkinson Pickens, who was elected as governor of the state.Wittenberg, p. 19. ==Civil War years== War-time photo of Butler During the Civil War, Butler served in the cavalry in the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, serving in Hampton's Legion, attaining the rank of captain on June 12, 1861, and then Major on July 21, 1861. When the legion's cavalry battalion was consolidated with the 4th South Carolina Battalion and became the 2nd South Carolina Cavalry Regiment on August 22, 1862, Butler was elected its colonel. Participating in many major actions with Hampton's Legion and the 2nd SC Cavalry, Butler lost his right foot to rifle fire at Battle of Brandy Station. He attained the rank of brigadier general in February 1864 and was referred to as \\"General Butler\\" in the postwar period. Butler led a brigade in Wade Hampton's division of the Cavalry Corps. When Hampton took command of that corps, Butler became division commander. Late in the war, he transferred to the Carolinas together with Lt. Gen. Hampton, leading a division at the Battle of Bentonville. General Butler was wounded again in that action. ==Postbellum== Financially ruined as a result of the war, Butler resumed his career as a lawyer in Edgefield. He was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives beginning in 1866. He became a member of the Democratic Party and ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 1870 during the Reconstruction era. He was a member of the pro-black Union Reform party. In July 1876, Butler defended two white farmers in court in their complaint of being denied free passage on Main Street of Hamburg, South Carolina, when the local chapter of the black militia, part of the National Guard, was parading on Independence Day. In court, Butler demanded that militia members turn over their arms to him, which they refused. Hundreds of white paramilitary members came to town and attacked the armory, where the militia company had taken refuge. They killed two freedmen on the street, including the town marshal, and later murdered five freedmen they had taken prisoner. One white man had been killed in early gunfireEhren K. Foley, \\"Sites of Violence: Hamburg Massacre\\" , South Carolina during Reconstruction website, 2010-2012, accessed 27 October 2014Trefousse, p. 100. (see Hamburg massacre). In 1877, after Federal troops had been withdrawn under a national Democratic compromise, Reconstruction ended. The Democratic Party regained control of the state in the 1876 elections. The South Carolina state legislature elected Butler to the United States Senate.Welsh, p. 32. During Senate hearings on his election, Butler was accused by Edgefield African-American leader Harrison N. Bouey of threatening to kill him and other local men.1877 Congressional Record, Senate, page 759 Butler served in the U.S. Senate for three terms, from 1877 to 1895, but lost for re-election in the South Carolina legislature to Benjamin Tillman, who was popular after serving as governor.United States Congress, p. 66. In 1890 while serving in the Senate, Butler introduced a bill to provide federal aid to African Americans who would emigrate to Africa to promote segregation, sparking a national debate.http://www.scencyclopedia.org/sce/entries/butler-matthew-calbraith/ While in the Senate, Butler served on the Senate Foreign Relations, Territories, Military Affairs, Naval Affairs, Interstate Commerce, Civil Service and Retrenchment committees. Butler practiced law in Washington, D.C., until 1898, when he was appointed major general of U.S. Volunteers during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. He was one of a handful of former Confederate officers (along with Fitzhugh Lee, Thomas L. Rosser, and Joseph Wheeler) to serve in the U.S. Army during that war. After the American victory that year, he supervised the evacuation of Spanish troops from Cuba.Porter, p. 44. He was honorably discharged from the U.S. Army on April 15, 1899.Warner, p. 41. In 1899 General Butler joined the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of Foreign Wars. In 1903, Butler was elected vice president of the Southern Historical Society. In 1904 he relocated to Mexico, where he served as president of a mining company. Having been a widower for years since his wife Maria died, in 1906 he married Nannie Whitman. They returned to Washington, DC. Butler died there in 1909 while semi-retired. His body was returned to Edgefield, South Carolina, where he was buried in the city's Willow Brook Cemetery.

She was a Ngarrindjeri woman, who often performed with her partner, Archie Roach AM, whom she met at the age of 16, while both were homeless teenagers.ABC TV: Talking heads: 12/05/2008 Archie Roach and Ruby Hunter Born near the mouth of the Murray River in the Coorong region of South Australia, Hunter was forcibly taken from her family at the age of eight as part of the Stolen Generation. Hunter first performed in public in 1988 during a festival at Bondi Pavilion in Sydney, where she performed \\"Proud, Proud Woman,\\" the first song she had written. In 1990, she wrote the autobiographical \\"Down City Streets\\", which was performed by Roach on his debut solo album Charcoal Lane. In 1994, Hunter became the first Indigenous Australian woman to record a solo \\"rock\\" album, and the first Aboriginal woman signed to a major record label, when she released her debut album Thoughts Within. She made her acting debut in One Night the Moon. With Roach and Paul Grabowsky, she wrote and performed the concert \\"Ruby's Story\\", which tells her life story through song and spoken word. At the 2020 National Indigenous Music Awards, Hunter was inducted into its Hall of Fame. ==Author == Hunter was the author of Butcher paper, texta, black board and chalk, a children's song-book which features Aboriginal songs about land, health and life. Many of the songs were written through song writing and music workshops held by Hunter and Roach with children across Cape York in Queensland. In 2005, Hunter was invited by Deborah Conway to take part in the Broad Festival project, with three other Australian female artists, where they performed their own and each other's songs. With Hunter and Conway were Sara Storer, Katie Noonan and Clare Bowditch. ==Personal life == As a child, Hunter lived with her brothers, Wally, Jeffrey and Robert, and sister Iris, with their grandmother and grandfather at the Aboriginal reserve at Point McLeay (later called Raukkan) on Lake Alexandrina in the Coorong region of South Australia. One day, Wally was taken off the street by government officials, and then the men took the rest of the children from their home, under the pretext that they were being taken to the circus. Thereafter Ruby lived in institutions and foster care, as one of the Stolen Generations, before drifting to Adelaide, staying for a spell at the Salvation Army People's Palace, where she met Roach. They later had two sons and fostered three children. Hunter died of a heart attack on 17 February 2010, aged 54.\\"Singer Ruby Hunter dies\\", The Age, 18 February 2010 Her partner Archie Roach established \\"Ruby's Foundation\\" to help continue her legacy.

The State Council gave universal adult franchise to the people of the colony for the first time. It replaced the Legislative Council of Ceylon, the colony's original legislative body. There were only two State Councils: the First, elected in 1931, and the Second, elected in 1936. The 1947 Soulbury Constitution replaced the State Council with the Parliament of Ceylon, as part of a process of constitutional development leading up to independence, which took place on 4 February 1948. ==History== Due to Ceylonese demands for constitutional reform, a royal commission was established by the British authorities under the chairmanship of the Earl of Donoughmore. The Donoughmore Commission arrived in the colony in 1927, before returning to the United Kingdom where it issued its report. The Commission proposed reforms which were implemented as the so- called Donoughmore Constitution, resulting in the abolition of the Legislative Council of Ceylon as the colony's legislature, and its replacement by a \\"State Council\\" in 1931. The structure and working of the State Council was experimental, and was based in part on the United Kingdom's London County Council. The State Council functioned in both an executive and legislative capacity, with seven committees performing executive duties. Each committee consisted of designated members of the State Council, and was chaired by an elected Ceylonese who was addressed as minister. The Ceylonese ministers formed a board of ministers with three British officials of ministerial rank who handled defence, external affairs, finance, and judicial matters. The Donoughmore Constitution was not considered a great success, and this combined with Ceylonese demands for further constitutional reform led to a new commission being established, under the chairmanship of Lord Soulbury, which arrived in Ceylon in 1944. Based on the report by the Soulbury Commission, a new constitution was created, by which the State Council was replaced by a Parliament, elections for which were conducted in 1947. Negotiations with Ceylon's newly elected government resulted in the British granting Ceylon independence as a dominion in 1948. ==Membership== Ministers of the Second State Council of Ceylon with the Speaker in 1936 The State Council consisted of 58 members, of whom 50 would be elected by universal suffrage, with the remaining 8 members appointed by the Governor. ===Members of the State Council=== ;Speakers of the State Council * Sir Alfred Francis Molamure (1931‚Äì34) * Sir Forester Augustus Obeysekera (1934‚Äì35) * Sir Waitialingm Duraiswamy (1936‚Äì47) ;Officers of State *Chief Secretary of Ceylon *Legal Secretary of Ceylon *Financial Secretary of Ceylon ;Leaders of the House * Sir Don Baron Jayatilaka (1931‚Äì42) * Don Stephen Senanayake (1942‚Äì47) ;Ministers of the State Council * First Board of Ministers of Ceylon (1931‚Äì35) * Second Board of Ministers of Ceylon (1936‚Äì47) ;Clerk of the State Council The Clerk of the State Council was the senior administrative officer of council and an apolitical civil servant. * G.

It was founded in 1938 by James E. Maloney as a small pottery workshop. The Williamsburg Pottery Factory now markets itself as one of Virginia's largest tourist attractions. Referred to by the locals as \\"the Pottery\\", the attraction offers a selection of locally handmade articles, as well as imports from 20 countries. Williamsburg Pottery was once famous for its \\"bare bones\\" appearance; however, it underwent a multimillion-dollar redevelopment that reshaped its look in the spring of 2012. ==History== In 1938, James E. Maloney founded Williamsburg Pottery, located near Colonial Williamsburg, making eighteenth-century salt glaze reproductions to sell at low prices. He purchased a half-acre property for $150 and built a kiln and simple workshop. As time passed, Maloney added china and glassware to his inventory, again with a focus on low prices. In addition to Maloney's famed salt glaze pottery, Williamsburg Pottery grew to include other artisans that sold a variety of handicrafts, like baskets and lamps. As sales grew, the small structure mushroomed into many warehouse buildings. By the 1960s, Williamsburg Pottery was the largest U.S. importer of home goods from Asia. Originally located entirely on Route 60, Maloney expanded his business across the railroad tracks in the mid-70s. Williamsburg Pottery eventually added a campground and factory outlet stores, growing to over and 32 buildings. By the early 1980s, Williamsburg Pottery was earning between $60 and $70 million a year in revenue. However, it began a decline in the 1990s with the rapid growth of other shopping venues on Route 60 closer to Williamsburg, and struggled with the death of its founder in 2005. In 2008, reports claimed that the business was up for sale, although Williamsburg Pottery President Kim Maloney denied these claims. ===Redevelopment=== New shopping center (2012) On August 31, 2010, Kim Maloney unveiled plans for a new $20 million, retail development. Construction began on the new Williamsburg Pottery in December 2010 at the original 1938 location on Richmond Road, following demolition of the old outlet buildings on that site. The new development has a much smaller footprint than before, with a more modern, sleek, and upscale look. The renovation, which resembles a Dutch- inspired European Marketplace, only covers 19 acres. It includes three separate buildings that encompass nearly 160,000 sq. ft. of retail and restaurant space, as well as over 10,000 sq. ft. of office space. The retail project was designed by Guernsey-Tingle Architects. Henderson Inc. was chosen as the General Contractor for the project, and AES Consulting Engineers was selected for the site plan work. All are local companies, as are most of the subcontractors. Demolition began in September 2010, with a groundbreaking ceremony in the beginning of December. Construction was completed in spring of 2012, with a grand opening held on April 5, 2012, the date which would have been founder Jimmy Maloney‚Äôs 100th birthday. There was a ceremonial ribbon cutting when they opened to the public. ==Visitors== At one time, Williamsburg Pottery was a top tourist attraction in the Historic Triangle. During the mid-1990s, it became such a popular attraction that Amtrak made Williamsburg Pottery a regular stop for passengers, although this stop was discontinued around 1996. It was estimated that more than 3,000,000 people visited Williamsburg Pottery on a yearly basis. As of 2010, visitors had dropped to 500,000 people a year. The number of visitors are not yet available since the 2012 redevelopment.

As a right-arm fast medium bowler, he has played Test matches and One Day Internationals (ODI) for the West Indian cricket team. Despite starting his cricketing career as a number 3 batsman, Powell is a genuine tailender. Powell has previously played for Gauteng, Derbyshire, Hampshire, and Lancashire. ==Early cricket== Daren Powell's father was a cricketer. Daren started playing cricket when he was about nine-years- old, and his first competitive experience was playing for St Elizabeth Technical High School. Powell originally bowled off spin. However, when his club was a seam bowler down in a match, he chose to switch his bowling action to fit the situation. He took seven wickets in the match while bowling seam. ==International career== On 21 June 2002, Powell made his international debut. He took three wickets in the Test match against New Zealand while conceding 102 runs; his first wicket was that of bowler Daryl Tuffey. New Zealand went on to win the match by 204 runs. Powell made his ODI debut later the same year; on 3 December 2002 in a match against Bangladesh during the West Indies tour of the country. He conceded 34 runs from 10 overs and took the wicket of opening batsman Anwar Hossain in the process of helping the West Indies win by 86 runs. After taking nine wickets at 27.55 in the West Indies' One Day International series against India in 2006/07, he gained selection for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. After poor performances with the ball in the test series against England in early 2009, taking six wickets at 69.33, he was dropped for the return series against England later in the summer. Ironically, given his lack of batting pedigree, it was with the bat that he had proved to be relatively effective, frustrating England's bowlers as he helped his side hang on for draws to seal the series in the Caribbean 1‚Äì0. A pay dispute between West Indies players and the West Indies Cricket Board in July 2009 led to an understrength team playing against Bangladesh; in the 15-man squad, there were nine uncapped players and seven players made their debut in the first Test. Powell stated that he had been approached to bolster the team, but he elected not to play. However, when the Champions Trophy squad was named later that month, Powell was included in a group still badly affected by the pay dispute; he did not play in the tournament. Later that year, it was announced that he had turned down other counties to sign a two-year contract to play for Lancashire as a Kolpak player, thus preventing him from representing the West Indies in the near future.Lancashire Sign Fast Bowler Daren Powell , Cricket World, 29 October 2009 Mike Watkinson, the club's director of cricket, described Powell as \\"a strike bowler of international quality, who will add strength and depth to our bowling attack\\" and said that the team would benefit from Powell's experience with the likely absence of Sajid Mahmood and James Anderson for parts of the season due to England duties. In February 2010, part-way through the West Indies cricket season, Powell withdrew from Jamaica's squad for \\"personal reasons\\". He had struggled for form, taking two wickets at an average of 73.00. Nehemiah Perry, Jamaica's chairman of selectors, said \\"[Powell] has decided to take a break and won't be available for the rest of the season. It's not a situation where he got dropped or anything. He's not enjoying cricket anymore as a person.\\" Powell was released from his contract with Lancashire in September 2010, a year before his contract expired. During his spell with Lancashire, Powell played in four County Championship matches, taking seven wickets at an average of nearly fifty. He went wicketless in his four T20 matches, although he took seven in nine Clydesdale Bank 40 matches. On the subject of Powell's time with Lancashire, Watkinson said \\"He has been a top bloke around the place but he hasn‚Äôt quite been able to seize his opportunity when he has had it\\". ==References== ==External links== * Category:West Indies One Day International cricketers Category:West Indies Test cricketers Category:West Indies Twenty20 International cricketers Category:Jamaican cricketers Category:Hampshire cricketers Category:Derbyshire cricketers Category:Jamaica cricketers Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Lancashire cricketers ","title":"Daren Powell"},{"id":"3252980","text":"Job enlargement means increasing the scope of a job through extending the range of its job duties and responsibilities generally within the same level and periphery. Job enlargement involves combining various activities at the same level in the organization and adding them to the existing job. It is also called the horizontal expansion of job activities. This contradicts the principles of specialisation and the division of labour whereby work is divided into small units, each of which is performed repetitively by an individual worker and the responsibilities are always clear. Some motivational theories suggest that the boredom and alienation caused by the division of labour can actually cause efficiency to fall. Thus, job enlargement seeks to motivate workers through reversing the process of specialisation. A typical approach might be to replace assembly lines with modular work; instead of an employee repeating the same step on each product, they perform several tasks on a single item. In order for employees to be provided with Job Enlargement they will need to be retrained in new fields to understand how each field works. The objective of job enlargement is to motivate an employee by increasing his efforts and exposure towards achieving the organizational objectives as set for the job. By doing this, an employee can get a wider range of his or her objectives without his or her job in a repetitious manner. Job enlargement requires the management of the organization to provide their support in providing appropriate training to the employees to make them able to adapt to the enlarged job scope. Some advantages of job enlargement are a variety of skills, improves earning capacity, and wide range of activities. * Variety of skills ‚Äì Job enlargement helps the organization to improve and increase the skills of the employee due to organization as well as the individual benefit. * Improves earning capacity ‚Äì with all the new activities a person learns from job enlargement, they are able to try to get a better salary when they apply for a new job. * Wide range of activities ‚Äì Employees are able to learn more activities which can help a company save money by reducing the number of employees they have. However results have shown that this process can see its effects diminish after a period of time, as even the enlarged job role become the mundane, this in turn can lead to similar levels of demotivation and job dissatisfaction at the expense of increased training levels and costs. The continual enlargement of a job over time is also known as 'job creep', which can lead to an unmanageable workload. Hulin and Blood (1968) define job enlargement as the process of allowing individual workers to determine their own pace (within limits), to serve as their own inspectors by giving them responsibility for quality control, to repair their own mistakes, to be responsible for their own machine set-up and repair, and to attain choice of method. Frederick Herzberg referred to the addition of interrelated tasks as 'horizontal job loading'. ==See also == * Job enrichment * Personnel management * Human resource management * Job satisfaction ==References== Category:Human resource management ","title":"Job enlargement"},{"id":"3252985","text":"Intiman Theatre Festival in Seattle, Washington, was founded in 1972 as a resident theatre by Margaret \\"Megs\\" Booker, who named it for August Strindberg's Stockholm theater.Initman History , Intiman official site.

After listening to input from artists, audiences, funders and the community, Intiman launched its first summer theatre festival in July and August 2012 under the leadership of Artistic Director Andrew Russell and Managing Director Keri Kellerman. The festival, curated from the impulses of an artist collective, featured four plays and a repertory company of 17 actors who stretched through over 40 roles.Laura Dannen, Intiman Theatre's Summer Festival Opens With Ibsen, Shakespeare and Savage , Seattle Met, June 20, 2012.

At the end of 2017, Andrew Russell completed his tenure as Producing Artistic Director and Jennifer Zeyl became Intiman's seventh Artistic Director. ==History== Courtyard of the Intiman Playhouse. Photographed 2009. Intiman's original location was a 65-seat theater in Kirkland, Washington. Under the leadership of artistic directors Megs and John Booker, the Intiman officially incorporated as a non-profit theatre in 1973. Over the next few years, the company mounted productions at Cornish College and Gary Austin's Second Stage Theatre in Seattle, growing in attendance and budget each season. By 1978, Intiman called itself \\"Seattle's Classic Theatre\\" and featured a resident company of fourteen actors, including Megan Cole, Clayton Corzatte, Ted D'Arms, John Gilbert, Patricia Healy, Richard Riele, Peter Silbert, Meg Hilton, Barry Mulholland, and Jean Smart. In 1977, Intiman opened year-round administrative offices in Pioneer Square and hired Simon Siegl as its first general manager. With a season of five classic plays, Intiman also began a parallel program \\"New Plays Onstage\\", staged readings of contemporary works directed and performed by members of the ensemble. Over the next several years, Intiman was awarded institutional status by the King County and Washington State Arts Commissions and received an NEA challenge grant. After a three-year planning process Intiman participated in the 1982 Scandinavia Today, an international exposition of Nordic culture, which took place in five American cities. Intiman presented staged readings of five contemporary works and two great classics on its main stage: The Wild Duck and A Dream Play, in collaboration with top Scandinavian directors, designers and playwrights. Meanwhile, Second Stage, Intiman's venue for nine theatrical seasons, faced demolition to make way for the Washington State Convention Center. For several years, Intiman, unlike any other professional resident theatre in the area, operated without a permanent home. Under the continued leadership of Booker and Siegl, Intiman rented various performance venues around the city on a short term, basis, including Broadway Performance Hall on the campus of Seattle Central Community College. This picture changed radically after 1985, when Peter Davis came aboard as Intiman's first managing director. Davis‚Äîa former scenic designer who had worked for both Intiman and Seattle Repertory Theatre‚Äîcompletely restructured Intiman's finances and administration. He successfully negotiated the plan for Intiman to operate and manage a theatre facility on the grounds of Seattle Center. That facility, the Seattle Center Playhouse (later Intiman Playhouse and later Cornish Playhouse) had been built for the Century 21 Exposition (the 1962 Seattle World's Fair), and had then served as the original home of the Seattle Repertory Theatre. In 1982, the Rep had moved to a new facility elsewhere on the Seattle Center grounds.Paula Becker, Intiman Theatre inaugurates its new home, the Playhouse Theatre, at the Seattle Center, on June 10, 1987, HistoryLink, September 21, 2006. Accessed online 2009-11-06. Intiman received a 22-year lease from the City. After a US$1.2 million renovation, in 1987, for the first time in its history, Intiman had a single facility with performance, rehearsal, production, shop and administrative areas. As it moved into its new facility, Intiman hired a new artistic director, Elizabeth Huddle, who served for the next six years, succeeded in 1993 by Warner Shook. In 1994, Intiman became the first regional theatre company in the country to be awarded the rights to produce Tony Kushner's Tony- and Pulitzer-winning two-part epic Angels in America. Part One: Millennium Approaches closed Intiman's 1994 season, and Part Two: Perestroika opened the 1995 season. Directed by Shook, the complete Angels in America was the most commercially successful production ever to be produced at the theatre, reaching more than 63,000 attendees over its two-year run. Over the next decade, Intiman produced plays by such provocative and influential American writers as Edward Albee, Mois√©s Kaufman, Ellen McLaughlin, Terrence McNally, David Rabe, Anna Deavere Smith, Paula Vogel, and Chay Yew. ==Recent history== * In 2008 Intiman completed a project entitled The American Cycle, a series of five plays written by prominent Americans‚Äî four of which were not originally written as plays. They were: # Thornton Wilder's Our Town (2004) # adapted John Steinbeck novel The Grapes of Wrath (2005) # adapted Richard Wright novel Native Son (2006) # adapted Harper Lee novel To Kill a Mockingbird (2007), and # adapted Robert Penn Warren novel All the King's Men (2008) * A new project, The New American Cycle, began in 2009 with Robert E. Sherwood's Abe Lincoln in Illinois. * During 2008‚Äì2010 Intiman was transitioning from one group of leaders to the next. Laura Penn departed as Managing Director in March, 2008. Her replacement, Brian Colburn, officially started in November, 2008 but did not move to Seattle until early 2009. Colburn resigned Nov. 1, 2010. Kate Whoriskey succeeded Bartlett Sher as Artistic Director in 2010. Originally the plan was for them to jointly manage the first season of the transition, but that changed when Mr. Sher departed in March, 2010. * On April 16, 2011 the Board of Trustees voted to close the Intiman Theatre and lay off the entire staff, including Artistic Director Kate Whoriskey. In November, 2010 the Intiman had found that the theatre was $2.3 million in debt and had begun a fundraising effort to pay overdue expenses and reduce debt. However, shortly after the season opened, the Board decided that the financial situation would compel the Board to close the theatre, temporarily. The Board engaged Susan Trapnell, a consultant, to advise it on a plan to reopen the theatre in 2012.\\"Prestige Can‚Äôt Halt Downfall of Theater\\", by Kate Taylor, New York Times, May 18, 2011 * On August 5, 2011 the first performance of Seattle Theatresports took place, the show having previously been performed in the Gum Wall Theatre in Pike Place Market. * The 2013 Summer Festival featured productions of: (1) \\"Trouble in Mind\\" by Alice Childress; (2) \\"We Won't Pay!

Prefabricated ocular prostheses with different colored iris are also available. Ocularist may select the stock eye which is closely matched to patient iris color. Due to better adaptation, comfort and esthetics custom-made ocular prosthesis is more accepted. In addition to creating the prosthetic eye, they show the patient how to care for and handle the prosthesis.

There is not a specific training program of study to call a person an \\"ocularist\\" at the present time. Therefore, this field is practiced in many places by maxillofacial prosthodontists, dentists who have undergone 3‚Äì4 years of specialty residency training. There are also technicians who practice this field as well after learning how to make artificial eyes through an apprenticeship program. There are also people who use the title of ocularist who have had no formal training in the fitting, manufacture, and delivery of ocular prosthetics. The American Society of Ocularists teaches the fitting, fabrication, insertion, and maintenance of artificial eyes.

NEBO designates the title of Board Certified Ocularist for Ocularists that have passed the NEBO examination. Those ocularists that have achieved and maintained certification by NEBO are designated as Board Certified Ocularists (BCO). An ocularist with this title has also pledged to make custom prosthetics as opposed to stock prosthetics. Traditionally ocularists hand paint the iris and sclera of an artificial eye.

In the anime and manga, Orochimaru is a former ninja of the village of Konohagakure who is known for his abilities. However, creating his ninja village Otogakure as means to perform inhumane experimentation, Orochimaru sought means to gain power and cheat death. In the latter, Orochimaru obtained a means for immortality by transferring between different host bodies which became one of his driving motivations throughout the series as he targets Sasuke Uchiha for his genetic heritage. While the main antagonist in Part I of the series, Orochimaru's role became overshadowed by the Akatsuki organization prior to the Fourth Ninja War arc. Orochimaru has appeared in media outside the Naruto anime and manga, including several video games. Based on Japanese mythology, Orochimaru was created as one of the series' main antagonists, and intended to represent the opposite of the protagonists' morals and values. His snake-like appearance and related features were intended to make it easier for the reader to recognize that he is a villain. In Japanese, Orochimaru has been voiced by Kujira whereas in the English dub he is voiced by Steve Blum. Several anime and manga publications have praised and criticized Orochimaru's character. As one of the series' premier villains, he has been praised in this regard. His lack of redeeming qualities and open malevolence was also praised by reviewers. Among the Naruto reader base, Orochimaru has been popular, ranking within the top twenty characters in several polls. Numerous pieces of merchandise in Orochimaru's likeness have also been released, including action figures and plush dolls. ==Creation and conception== Yamata no Orochi fighting Susanno. This scene is similarly shown in Naruto. Most of the traits of Orochimaru's character were taken from Japanese mythology. Orochimaru originates from the Japanese folktale Jiraiya G≈çketsu Monogatari where he opposes the title character who also appears in Naruto as his former ally. He wields a sword named Kusanagi is said to be related to creature known as the Yamata no Orochi. In Japanese mythology, Yamata no Orochi is defeated by the god Susanoo with Orochimaru taking using the a technique also known as Yamata no Orochi but is defeated by Itachi Uchiha's own Susanoo technique. The introduction of Orochimaru to the series was first suggested by Masashi Kishimoto's superiors in order to improve the series' popularity. Kishimoto believed the series grew personality based on the Chunin Exams story arc and wanted it to end normally with Shikamaru Nara's victory. However, he eventually accepted their advice and Orochimaru was set up to interrupt this arc. As one of the villains in the story, Kishimoto created Orochimaru as an antithesis to the protagonists' values. His snake-like appearance and related features were intended to make it easier for the reader to recognize that he is a villain. In an interview, Kishimoto asserted that making the villains \\"flamboyant\\" was one of his \\"guiding principles,\\" and attributed this to his desire to have the villains have a \\"powerful aura.\\" When asked if Orochimaru was still good, Kishimoto answered that Orochimaru is \\"truly evil\\" and that he is one of the several \\"hopeless evil characters\\" that appear in the series. Originally Kishimoto planned to make Orochimaru's look androgynous. However, because of the concept of him being a strong antagonist, he made him more creepy. Of most of the characters, Orochimaru was the hardest one to write. Kishimoto wanted him to be a terrifying opponent, so he wondered if that was really the way to go to make him sound strong. Then I started thinking it was good like that, he's strong and creepy, and the creepyness started increasing. Following this theme of distinguishing villains, Kishimoto attempted to make Orochimaru's face appear \\"pasty and sickly,\\" which serves to emphasize the \\"scary looks\\" that Kishimoto frequently has Orochimaru performing in the manga. Orochimaru's nature type is fire, earth, and wind. As these occurrences are his \\"trademark,\\" Kishimoto modifies Orochimaru's appearance and the scene to focus on Orochimaru's face; for instance, highlights that are normally added to Orochimaru's hair are removed and the background is blanked out to create a \\"creepy atmosphere.\\" ==Appearances== ===In Naruto=== Orochimaru acts as the primary antagonist for the first part of the series. After his parents were killed when he was young, Orochimaru's only source of affection was received from his teacher, the Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi, and his two teammates. As they grew older Orochimaru, Jiraiya, and Tsunade collectively became known as the due to their exemplary ninja abilities in the Second Great Ninja War against Hanzo. Much of Orochimaru's arsenal of abilities deals with snakes, using them in summoning to battle multiple opponents while simultaneously keeping himself out of harm's way. Through his experiments he has also been able to add some snake-like characteristics to his own body. Desiring immortality to learn every jutsu, Orochimaru developed a forbidden jutsu to steal his victim's body. Though essentially immortal, Orochimaru learns the process can not be done more than once every three years. Orochimaru, however, craved more power than could be obtained from training with his master, and began abducting villagers of Konohagakure for various experiments with Yamato among his surviving victims. Unwilling to bring himself to harm Orochimaru upon learning of his actions, Hiruzen allowed his former pupil to escape and flee the village. In time Orochimaru joined the criminal organization Akatsuki and became partners with a fellow Rogue Ninja named Sasori. However, after his attempt to steal the body of Itachi Uchiha through a forbidden jutsu so as to gain the failed, Orochimaru is forced to leave the Akatsuki. Orochimaru then founded his own ninja village, Otogakure, populated with ninja loyal to him who mostly serve as test subjects in his experimentation to become an ultimate being and as pawns to do his dirty work. During the Chunin Exams, Orochimaru plans the invasion of Konoha with the ninja of Sunagakure to not only kill Hiruzen but also claim the body of Itachi's brother Sasuke Uchiha. To that end, Orochimaru infiltrated the Chunin Exam's Forest of Death round by killing a Grass ninja named Shiore and assuming her identity to personally test Sasuke before branding him with a Curse Mark once satisfied with the youth's abilities, he also had to face Naruto Uzumaki, and when the later effectively resists Orichimaru's giant snake jutsu using the chakra of the Nine-Tail Fox, Orichimaru, using the Five Elements Seal, blocked access to the chakra of the Nine-Tails by disturbing the balance of the original seal. For the duration of the Exams, Orochimaru laid in wait and secretly murdered the Fourth Kazekage to assume his identity and get close to his mentor as the invasion begins. However, Orochimaru is forced to retreat when Hiruzen sacrifices himself through the Reaper Death Seal to take away Orochimaru's ability to perform jutsu with his forces pulling back while Sunagakure later learns of Orochimaru's treachery. Wanting to regain the ability to use jutsu, Orochimaru attempts to get aid from Tsunade before seeking out another way to cure himself. When all his efforts prove unsuccessful, Orochimaru sends his Sound Four to fetch Sasuke, hoping that a body-transfer will allow him to use his arms again. Though he waits as long as he can, Sasuke takes too long to arrive and Orochimaru is forced to switch to the body of one of his prisoners instead. Once Sasuke arrives, Orochimaru decides to train him instead until the day that he will be able to take the body for himself. Two-and-a-half years later, in the second part of the series, Orochimaru confronts Naruto and his friends when they attempted to track down Sasuke. Later, when Sasuke attempts to kill Naruto, Orochimaru stays his hand by pointing out the boy's use in taking down the Akatsuki and thus lessening the number of enemies he has. Eventually, Sasuke uses his Sharingan to void Orochimaru's technique and retains control of his body while trapping Orochimaru's soul within him. The suppression, in turn, gives Sasuke access to many of Orochimaru's abilities in the process. During Sasuke's later fight with Itachi, Sasuke is left too weak to continue suppressing Orochimaru's soul, allowing Orochimaru to escape and try to take his body again. Before he can do so, Itachi seals him away. In the aftermath of Kabuto's defeat and needing answers, Sasuke exposes Orochimaru's survival as the Cursed Seals are revealed to hold a copy of Orochimaru's consciousness in it along with the cells of Orochimaru that Kabuto injected into himself and subjugated. Using the Cursed Seal Orochimaru placed on his former student, Anko Mitarashi, Sasuke releases Orochimaru and gives him a new body which Jugo provides with an absorbed part of Kabuto's flesh. Despite expressing no interest in the ongoing war and still desiring to claim Sasuke's body, Orochimaru then joins Sasuke in his quest for answers over the nature of ninja, taking him and Taka to the Nara Shrine where he undoes the Reaper Death Seal and regains the use of ninjutsu before transferring his being into one of the White Zetsu clones placed on Sasuke. In his new body, Orochimaru then brings the first four Hokage back to life with the Reanimation Jutsu to give Sasuke the answers he wants. Once Sasuke got his answer from Hashirama, out of curiosity to see his former apprentice's new path while the actions of Madara and Obito jeopardize his laboratories, Orochimaru offers to help the Allied Shinobi Forces by first coming to the aid of Tsunade and the Kage and assist in subduing the Shinju. After the Fourth Great Ninja War ended, among those caught under Madara's Infinite Tsukiyomi before being freed, Orochimaru resumes his experiments with Sasuke's Taka teammates supporting him as lab assistants, though Konoha remains suspicious of him and keeps tabs on him in case he resumes his former human experimentation activities. ===In Boruto=== In sequel series Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, which takes place 15 years after Naruto, Orochimaru is revealed to have created two artificial humans based on his DNA, naming the youngest Mitsuki whom he considered a son and masterminded sending him to live in Konoha and find his own path in life. He also appears in the Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring side story with his younger appearance noted by the confused main characters. In the post-credit scene of Boruto: Naruto the Movie, Orochimaru is seen watching Mitsuki with his teammates. ===Appearances in other media=== Orochimaru so far has only appeared in the fifth Naruto film, Naruto Shipp≈´den 2: Bonds. He is not present in the other four films in the series, had a small part in fifth OVA \\"The Cross Roads\\". Orochimaru is a playable character in nearly all Naruto video games, including the Clash of Ninja series and the Ultimate Ninja series. In some games, he utilizes variations of his techniques not seen in the anime or manga, and in the second installment of the Ultimate Ninja series, his state after his arms were sealed by the Third Hokage is available as a separate character. Naruto Shipp≈´den: Gekit≈ç Ninja Taisen! EX 2 marks the first appearance of Orochimaru in a video game set in Part II, with the second one being Naruto Shipp≈´den: Ultimate Ninja 4. Orochimaru also appears in two light novels from the franchise. In Sasuke's Story, he aids Sasuke in a mission by providing him information of his target. Meanwhile, in Konoha Hiden he makes a cameo congratulating Naruto Uzumaki and Hinata Hyuga for their wedding. ==Reception== Orochimaru has been featured consistently in the Weekly Shonen Jump popularity polls, commonly placing in the top twenty characters. However, in the last popularity poll, he was out of the top thirty characters. Merchandise based on Orochimaru has also been released, including action figures, plush dolls, and key chains. AnimeCentral listed him as tenth best villain in anime owing to his objectives and methods, most notably how he scares Sasuke Uchiha the first time seeing him despite Sasuke's strength. In the book Listverse.com's Ultimate Book of Bizarre Lists: Fascinating Facts and Shocking Trivia on Movies, Music, Crime, Celebrities, History, and More by Jamie Frater, Orochimaru was listed as the eighth most evil villain with the writer calling him \\"pure evil\\". Several publications for manga, anime, video games, and other related media have provided praise and criticism on Orochimaru's character. IGN writer Jason Van Horn compared Orochimaru's search for power and subsequent fall into villainy to that of Darth Sidious from Star Wars, and labeled Orochimaru as \\"something more than just pure evil.\\" Justin Rich from Mania Entertainment considered Orochimaru the \\"first real villain\\" of the series, noting that he had no redeeming qualities, as versus Zabuza Momochi, the villain of the previous arc. DVDTalk's Todd Douglass Jr. celebrated the introduction of Orochimaru into the series, as well as the potential plot development from the curse seal Orochimaru placed on Sasuke, noting it was one of the best parts of the series. Carl Kimlinger from Anime News Network that Orochimaru's influence over him kept the tension high even when he had minor appearances. Javier Lugo from Manga Life praised the fight between Orochimaru and the Third Hokage based on the surprises such encounter showed. Instead, Bamboo Dong from Anime News Network labeled Orochimaru to be a character that can not be killed. IGN's Charles White considered Orochimaru as \\"one of the more interesting characters on the show\\" as he states Orochimaru \\"can literally steal the show at any time\\". A. E. Sparrow from the same site praised Orochimaru's scenario in the 13th volume of the manga as he interrupts the current story arc in order to engage with the Third Hokage in a possible deadmatch despite interrupting the fight between Sasuke and Gaara which readers have been looking for. Following Orochimaru's fight against the Hokage there have been more comments. About.com writer Deb Aoki commented that after his fight with the Third Hokage, Orochimaru was in poor shape to the point being replaced by the Akatsuki organization as the new antagonists. In the book The Rough Guide to Manga, Jason S. Yadao notes Orochimaru impact in Part I of the series due to his influence on one of the protagonists, Sasuke, to abandon his comrades and join him. Nevertheless, Holly Ellingwood from Active Anime described him as \\"sinister\\" and noted her proposal to revive Tsunade's loved ones in exchange to healing his arms made it appealing. Additionally, Kimlinger considered Kujira, Orochimaru's Japanese voice actress, as one of the best ones from the series. Despite the character's small appearances in Part II, most of them were well received. The way Orochimaru angers Naruto Uzumaki in their battle as well as how he manages events ever since his reintroduction have been deemed as \\"near perfectly\\" by Mania's Chris Beveridge. Orochimaru's fight against Sasuke in later parts from the series was praised by Mangalife's Park Cooper due to how it changes \\"the nature of things\\" in a short time. While agreeing with Cooper, Beveridge found that the fight did not bring a certain end to Orochimaru which he thought it would have made it more entertaining. On the other hand, Beveridge liked how during the fight between the two a flashback showed Orochimaru's backstory in Konoha, which helped in expanding his character. His apparent redemption to follow Sasuke in later parts of the story was criticized by writer Jason Thompson during a review of the manga. On the other hand, Bryce Coulter from the Fandom Post found Orochimaru's change based on Sasuke's new interest intriguing due to the future possibilities of becoming Konohagakure's ally. Ramsey Isler from IGN still praised the relationship between Orochimaru and his ally Kabuto Yakushi as the former often wondered if Kabuto was ever going to betray him. In the final episodes of the anime Naruto Shippuden Orochimaru made small cameos during the preparations for Naruto and Hinata's wedding which were found hilarious by Amy Mcnulty from Anime News Network. == References == == External links == Category:Naruto characters Category:Anime and manga characters with accelerated healing Category:Comics characters introduced in 2000 Category:Fictional characters who can duplicate themselves Category:Fictional characters who can stretch themselves Category:Fictional characters with immortality Category:Fictional mad scientists Category:Fictional mass murderers Category:Fictional necromancers Category:Fictional ninja Category:Fictional serial killers Category:Fictional snakes Category:Fictional special forces personnel Category:Fictional swordsmen Category:Male characters in anime and manga Category:Orphan characters in anime and manga Category:Animated series villains Category:Male villains ","title":"Orochimaru (Naruto)"},{"id":"3253012","text":"√Ålfr√∫n Gunnlaugsd√≥ttir is an Icelandic writer who was born in Reykjav√≠k on 18 March 1938.

It is one of only two ways that motorists can leave or enter the Florida Keys (the other is U.S. Route 1). The toll for two-axle automobiles is USD $1.50 (USD $1.00 for each additional axle) if paid via SunPass. An additional $2.50 surcharge is assessed for vehicles tolled via license plate photo. The all-electronic tolling system replaced the previous manned toll booth on October 20, 2018. The toll fee is waived upon evacuating the Keys for hurricanes or in instances in which US 1 is impassable. ==Operation== Looking west on the bridge, towards the toll station, in 2011 The primary responsibility for operating Card Sound Bridge lies with Monroe County, but maintenance of the bridge itself is shared between Monroe County and the Florida Department of Transportation. The bridge itself is on Card Sound Road, constructed by then-Dade County in 1926 for the original Card Sound Bridge. Toll employees are locals, living in a very small town along Card Sound Road on the north side of the bridge, and according to toll operators, a portion of the proceeds from the toll go to fund parts of their community. Effective August, 2017, the toll booth was closed and all employees were laid off. In December, 2017, the toll booth was removed in preparation for an automated toll booth to be installed in the spring of 2018. This is expected to save Monroe county approximately $300,000 per year in employee wages. ==The first Card Sound Bridges== Like the Overseas Highway, the history of Card Sound Bridge begins with the Overseas Railway - although at no time was the bridge part of Henry M. Flagler's plans. The concept of an Overseas Highway (then called \\"Overseas Road\\") began with the Miami Motor Club in 1921.History of the Overseas Highway At that time, southern Florida was undergoing a land boom, and the club wanted to attract new tourists to an easily reached fishing area. In addition, the real estate interests wanted access to thousands of acres of wilderness in the Upper Keys to develop and sell. Commissioners from Dade and Monroe Counties agreed to build a highway connecting Florida City to Key Largo. They preferred to build it alongside the Overseas Railroad, which was completed in 1912; commercial interests and motorists attending the joint meeting expressed a preference for a road extending to the southeast, to Card Sound, instead. In 1922, Monroe County residents approved the issuance of $300,000 of bonds for a new bridge; under an agreement with their Monroe brethren, Dade County officials would oversee the construction of an -long Card Sound Road to the wooden drawbridge. Construction of both the road and the drawbridge went slowly. The money ran out in 1925 and Monroe County voters were asked to approve the issuance of $2.6 million in bonds in early 1926. The vote‚Äîpassing the measure with only two dissenting votes‚Äîenabled construction to continue. The swing span drawbridge and road were both nearly ready for opening when, on September 18, 1926 a major hurricane seriously damaged both.Monroe County History The bridge was redesigned and rebuilt, raising the water clearance from five feet to nine feet to accommodate storm surge. On January 25, 1928, the , wooden, Card Sound Bridge was opened to traffic. ==State Road 4A and US 1== When Card Sound Bridge was opened, the State Road Department (the predecessor to the Florida Department of Transportation), extended the State Road 4A designation from downtown Homestead to Key West (prior to this, SR 4A went from the intersection of present-day U.S. Route 1 and US 41 in Miami to Homestead), even though there was still a gap in the road between Lower Matecumbe Key and No Name Key.1933 Florida Road Map After the Great Labor Day Hurricane destroyed sections of the Overseas Railroad on September 3, 1935, the State of Florida bought the remnants for $640,000 and proceeded to construct road bridges on top of the railroad trestles. The \\"Overseas Highway\\" was completed and opened (as a toll road) on March 29, 1938. The following year, US 1 was extended from Miami over Card Sound to Key West. ==Decline and fall of the wooden drawbridge== World War II triggered a sequence of events that diminished the importance and usefulness of Card Sound Bridge. In 1941, a water pipeline was constructed from the Everglades to Key Largo along the old railroad right-of-way; the following year, a new roadway was constructed beside the pipeline, and US 1 was rerouted along the new highway (locally known as the \\"18 Mile Stretch\\"). In addition to shortening the route by , it enabled motorists to avoid the wooden bridges in northern Key Largo - including Card Sound. A 1944 fire seriously damaged Card Sound's drawbridge, which was subsequently removed to prevent its further use; a 1947 hurricane and additional fires caused Monroe County officials to remove the Card Sound Bridge completely. ==The return of Card Sound Bridge== In the two decades after the removal of the Card Sound wooden drawbridge, various schemes to increase access between the Keys and mainland Florida came and went. A -long bridge from Cape Sable to No Name Key did not succeed due to the establishment of Everglades National Park; a monorail from Miami to Cape Sable to Key West met the same fate. In the 1960s a plan to connect Key Biscayne to northern Key Largo by way of Elliott Key almost took root as officials from Dade and Monroe Counties differed on the division of toll revenues. In the meantime, the United States Department of the Interior started purchasing land in Biscayne Bay with an eye toward creating a new National Park. The 1968 formation of Biscayne National Monument (which became Biscayne National Park in 1980) hastened the demise of the \\"Islandia plan\\" (named after a sparsely populated municipality on Elliott Key), but one component of the proposal survived: a new -high causeway to be the new Card Sound Bridge. The new causeway was completed and open to traffic in 1969. Card Sound Road became State Road 905A, a FDOT designation which was modified to SR S-905A in the mid-1970s. In the early 1980s, Card Sound Road was transferred to county maintenance in both Dade and Monroe Counties, although the stretch on northern Key Largo between Ocean Reef Club and US 1 is still \\"State Road 905\\" in Monroe County ordinances passed in the 2000s. Actually, County Road 905A has its northern terminus at an intersection with US 1 in Florida City and its southern terminus at County Road 905 in northern Key Largo five miles (8 km) to the east of Card Sound Bridge (CR 905 continues southwestward eight miles (13 km) until it joins US 1). Both CR 905 and 905A on Key Largo still show FDOT signs indicating State routes on their shoulders. As of 2016, Card Sound Bridge is traversed by 3500 vehicles daily.http://flto.dot.state.fl.us/website/FloridaTrafficOnline/viewer.html ==References== 7\\\\. https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/florida- keys/article219877650.html Category:Florida Keys 905 Category:Roads in Monroe County, Florida Category:Toll bridges in Florida Category:Intracoastal Waterway Category:Bridges completed in 1926 Category:Swing bridges in the United States Category:Bridges completed in 1969 Category:Road bridges in Florida Category:1926 establishments in Florida Category:Causeways in Florida Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Monroe County, Florida ","title":"Card Sound Bridge"},{"id":"3253022","text":"Georg Rasch (21 September 1901 ‚Äì 19 October 1980) was a Danish mathematician, statistician, and psychometrician, most famous for the development of a class of measurement models known as Rasch models. He studied with R.A. Fisher and also briefly with Ragnar Frisch, and was elected a member of the International Statistical Institute in 1948. In 1919, Rasch began studying mathematics at the University of Copenhagen. He completed a master's degree in 1925 and received a doctorate in science with thesis director Niels Erik N√∏rlund in 1930. Rasch married in 1928. Unable to find work as a mathematician in the 1930s, he turned to work as a statistical consultant. In this capacity, he worked on a range of problems, including problems of biological growth. ==Contributions to psychometrics== Georg Rasch is best known for his contributions to psychometrics. His work in this field began when he used the Poisson distribution to model the number of errors made by students when reading texts. He referred to the model as the multiplicative Poisson model. He later developed the Rasch model for dichotomous data, which he applied to response data derived from intelligence and attainment tests including data collected by the Danish military. At the same epoch, American scientists independently developed item response theory (IRT). Within IRT, the Rasch model is one of the most simple response models. In contrast to other simple models, the Rasch model has a distinctive mathematical property: the model parameters (item difficulties, examinee ability) are sufficient statistics. Rasch demonstrated that his approach met criteria for measurement deduced from an analysis of measurement in the physical sciences. He also proposed generalizations of his model (Rasch, 1960/1980, 1977). Today, the Rasch model is used extensively in assessment in education and educational psychology, particularly for attainment and cognitive assessments. ==Major publications== Rasch, G. (1960/1980).

RechilaSpanish: Requila; in Portuguese: R√©quila or R√©quita. (died 448) was the Suevic King of Galicia from 438 until his death. There are few primary sources for his life, but Hydatius was a contemporary Christian (non-Arian) chronicler in Galicia. When his father, Hermeric, turned ill in 438, he retired from active political life (dying in 441) and handed the reins of government and the royal title over to his son.Thompson, Romans and Barbarians, 165. Hermeric did not, as Isidore mistakenly believed, retain some royal powers after 438 (Thompson, 220). He endeavoured to expand the Suevic kingdom to fill the vacuum left by the retiring Vandals and Alans. In 438 he defeated Andevotus, the comes Hispaniarum, on the river Genil (Singillio).Thompson, Romans and Barbarians, 173. The Roman position in Iberia became so tenuous that three magistri utriusque militiae (masters of both services) were sent to the peninsula between 441 and 446. Invading southern Iberia, Rechila took the provincial capitals of M√©rida in 439 and Seville in 441.Thompson, Romans and Barbarians, 172. These conquests were extremely significant, but nothing of the sequence of events leading to them is known. The provinces of Lusitania, Baetica, and Carthaginiensis were subjected to the Suevi with the exception of the Levante and the Mediterranean seaboard.Thompson, Romans and Barbarians, 182. Rechila was involved in near constant war with the Romans. While returning in 440 from his third embassy to the Suevi, the Roman legate Censorius was captured by Rechila near M√©rtola (Myrtilis). The king had him imprisoned for the remainder of his reign. Rechila died a pagan in M√©rida: gentilis moritur (\\"died a gentile\\") according to Hydatius, but Isidore of Seville, writing well over a century and a half later, and whose source was Hydatius, says ut ferunt, gentilitatis vitam finivit (\\"finished his life a gentile, so they say\\"). There is no reason, however, for accepting Isidore's doubts, which were probably precipitated by the fact that Rechila's son and successor was the Catholic Rechiar.Thompson, Romans and Barbarians, 218 and 306 n30. Some scholars have raised the contention that his father raised him that way in order to foster good relations with the Church and bring about the easy conversion of the Suevi.Thompson, \\"The Conversion of the Spanish Suevi\\", 79, who denies this.

Rechiar or RechiariusCastilian and Galician: Requiario; Portuguese: Requi√°rio. (after 415His father Rechila married a daughter of Wallia, king of the Visigoths (415‚Äì19); the marriage took place between 415 and 419. - December 456) was the Suevic king of Gallaecia from 448 until his death. He was the first Chalcedonian Christian (Catholic) Germanic king in Europe and one of the most innovative and belligerent of the Suevi monarchs. Despite his orthodox Christianity, Hydatius, the contemporary bishop and chronicler from Galicia who is the sole contemporary source for biographical details of Rechiar, established his reputation as that of a barbarian with little sense of Roman law, culture, or custom. ==Religion== Rechiar was almost certainly not raised Christian, though some scholars have raised the contention that his father raised him that way in order to foster good relations with the Church and bring about the easy conversion of the Suevi.Thompson, \\"The Conversion of the Spanish Suevi\\", 79. What is certain is the Rechiar had been converted (catholicus factus according to Isidore's Historia Suevorum) before reaching the throne. Rechiar's conversion to Trinitarian christianism predated that of the more famous Clovis of the Franks by half a century. The argument was even raised in the late nineteenth century that the Spanish church had primacy over the French because Rechiar's conversion predated Clovis'. Rechiar was the son of the pagan Rechila, whom he succeeded on the throne, and a daughter of the Visigothic king Wallia. The date and circumstances of Rechiar's conversion from paganism are unknown and it is possible that Roman missionaries took some part in it, since he was not converted to the Arianism which was preached by the Visigothic missionaries. Rechiar was one of the only Suevi to convert at that time; his people remained pagan. Hydatius records opposition, possibly secret,Thompson, Romans and Barbarians, 165. to his succession, but the basis of this opposition he does not mention. It is not inconceivable that it was religiously motivated. Rechiar married an Arian Visigothic princess from Toulouse, the daughter of Theodoric I.Collins, Visigothic Spain, 31. The marriage of Catholic to Arian was not advantageous for the church of the former and the influence of Rechiar's queen and another later Arian queen helped bring about the conversion of the Suevi not to Catholicism, but to Arianism. If Rechiar did make any effort to convert his people to his faith, it was entirely ephemeral and \\"bore no detectable fruit\\".Thompson, \\"The Conversion of the Spanish Suevi\\", 91. ==Administration== Rechiar was a powerful enough ruler to mint his own coinage, on which he had stamped the legend ivssv rechiari reges. Indeed, he was the first Germanic king to mint coins (siliquae)Edmondson, \\"Mining in the Later Roman Empire and Beyond\\", 100. bearing his name and the first to claim the right (ivssv) to mint them.Thompson, Romans and Barbarians, 212. Three of these coins survive, bearing witness to his complete independence from even nominal Roman authority. Rechiar's kingship was primitive enough, however, that it appears he took the royal thesaurus (treasure) with him on his campaigns.Thompson, Romans and Barbarians, 169. He also did not employ Roman bureaucrats or lawyers, for he did not recognise Roman law nor did he have a formal relationship with the Roman empire or the land on which his men settled, roamed, and marauded.Thompson, Romans and Barbarians, 209. He kept his capital at Braga. ==Wars== Rechiar was a bellicose ruler, who made war on all of his neighbours. In 448, at the commencement of his reign, the Roman count Censorius was executed at Seville by a Suevic nobleman named Agiulf. It has been surmised by some that this act was connected with Rechiar's warlike attitude towards Rome. He even allied with the Bagaudae in ravaging the Ebro valley, a unique occurrence between Germanic rulers and local peasant rebels.Thompson, Romans and Barbarians, 184-185\\\\. Isidore of Seville believed that it was not Bagaudae with which Rechiar allied, but rather the Visigoths. Theodore Mommsen follows him, but there is no reason to accept Isidore over Hydatius and every reason not to when considering that Isidore refuses to mention the Bagaude in his Historia. Rechiar also impelled the first contact between the Suevi and the Basques: he made war on them in February 449. The expedition may have been a mere raid or an attempted conquest of Vasconia as a prelude to the conquest of the Ebro valley.Collins, \\"The Basques in Aquitaine and Navarre\\", 6. Later in 449 he visited his father-in-law in Gaul.Thompson, Romans and Barbarians, 189. On his return home to Galicia, Rechiar allied with Basilius, leader of one of the Bagaudae, and raided the Ebro valley, attacking Zaragoza and even entering L√©rida (Ilerda) \\"by a trick\\".Thompson, Romans and Barbarians, 162. He took many prisoners, but he failed to take the region and thus complete the Suevic conquest of Hispania. Rechiar did not approach Tarragona, the provincial capital. Unlike his father-in-law, he did not take part in the battle of the Catalaunian Plains in 451. Following the assassination of the patrician Flavius A√´tius and the emperors Valentinian III and Petronius Maximus in 455, Rechiar led an attack on Carthaginiensis, probably with the intent of conquest. Later that year he attacked the province of Tarraconensis, the only province of Hispania still under Roman control, but did not conquer it.Thompson, \\"The Conversion of the Spanish Suevi\\", 80.Thompson, Romans and Barbarians, 163. According to Jordanes, he had \\"presumed\\" on the basis of his relationship to the Visigothic king and Roman foederatus Theodoric II (his brother-in-law), that he could rule all of Hispania. Theodoric, acting on the orders of the emperor Avitus, invaded Hispania in 456 with an army of Goths, Franks, Burgundians (under their kings Chilperic I and Gundioch), and perhaps even Romans to confront the Suevi, who in turn planned to meet the invaders on the borders of Tarraconensis.Thompson, Romans and Barbarians, 296 n12, notes that Felix Dahn believed Theodoric invaded Hispania feeling that Suevic control of Tarraconensis would threaten his kingdom of Toulouse. Thompson himself dismisses the argument. On 5 October 456 Theodoric defeated Rechiar in a battle at the Campus Paramus twelve miles from Astorga on the Urbicus (√ìrbigo). He was wounded during the battle, but according to Hydatius managed to flee as far as Porto in the heart of his kingdom, while Jordanes says he took ship in the Tyrrhenian Sea (i.e., the western Mediterranean) before winds forced him back and he was captured.Thompson, Romans and Barbarians, 297 n15. Jordanes is almost certainly wrong; at Porto Rechiar was captured and executed in December.Thompson, Romans and Barbarians, 164. The Suevic monarchy collapsed, rapidly disintegrating into rival factions over the following years. Braga fell on 28 October and the Visigoths brutally sacked the city and the churches before moving on to conquer Andalusia. During the century of Arianism that soon commenced, nothing about the Suevi was recorded. ==Notes== ==References== *Collins, Roger. \\"The Basques in Aquitaine and Navarre: Problems of Frontier Government.\\" War and Society in the Middle Ages: Essays in Honour of J.

He is the thrice great-grandson of George Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan, who is remembered for his role in the Crimean War, leading the cavalry division which included the Heavy Brigade and the Light Brigade, the latter of which was involved in the Charge of the Light Brigade. The Binghams are an Anglo-Irish aristocratic family. Lucan was educated at Eton College and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He married Anne-Sofie Foghsgaard (known as \\"Fie\\"; b. 1977) at St George's, Hanover Square, London, on 14 January 2016. She is the daughter of Danish industrialist Lars Foghsgaard, the former owner of the Spott Estate in East Lothian, Scotland. They have two children, a daughter, Lady Daphne, born in 2017 and a son Lord Bingham (Charles Lars John), born in 2020.Country clothing range opens a new chapter in the Lucan dynasty history, Daily Express, 20 February 2018 Lord Lucan has two sisters: Lady Frances Bingham (born 1964), and Lady Camilla Bloch QC (born 1970), who married Michael Bloch QC in 1998. Lucan's father, the 7th Earl, disappeared in November 1974 after the murder of the family nanny Sandra Rivett. The 8th Earl and his sister Lady Camilla are not convinced that their father was responsible for Sandra Rivett's death.Dominic Gover, \\"Lord Lucan TV Drama Condemned by Aristocrat's Daughter\\" dated 4 November 2013, at ibtimes.co.uk ==Succession== In the 1990s the Probate Registry (a division of the High Court of Justice) gave leave for the 7th Earl to be sworn dead by his trustees and the family was granted probate over his estate in 1999, but no death certificate was issued. In 1998, Bingham, supported by sworn statements from his entire living family excluding his mother, and by the Metropolitan Police, applied for his father to be declared dead for House of Lords purposes. The Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine of Lairg decided he was unable to issue Bingham his writ of summons to the Lords without a death certificate for his father. In October 2015, twelve months after the Presumption of Death Act came into effect, Bingham sought his father to be declared dead at the General Register Office who issue death certificates which required in this case a High Court application. On 3 February 2016, a judge declared the GRO could issue the certificate, allowing Bingham to inherit the titles. On 23 May 2016, Lucan formally petitioned the House of Lords to have his succession recognised. On 7 June, the House declared that he had established his claims to the titles and he was directed to be entered on the register of hereditary peers maintained in connection with the House of Lords Act 1999 by virtue of his subsidiary title Baron Bingham in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. As of March 2018, he has not stood in the internal Lords by-elections for replacing of the 92 electable hereditary representative peers (upon their retirements or deaths). == References == Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:British bankers Category:Alumni of Trinity Hall, Cambridge Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Earls of Lucan ","title":"George Bingham, 8th Earl of Lucan"},{"id":"3253066","text":"Danielle Le Ray is an Australian gymnast.

After the execution of Rechiar by the victorious Visigoths, the Suevi are said to have established Maldras on the throne. During his reign the Suevic nation became fragmented. Maldras was the son of Massilia (or Massila) and was not said to be related to the dynasty of Hermeric, which had ruled the Suevi since 406.Thompson, 166. The wording of the contemporary chronicler Hydatius may be taken to signify that the Suevi population had some part in electing Maldras. They certainly had a part in dividing the kingdom in 457, when part of them refused to accept him as their leader and chose instead Framta. The two Suevic kings acted independently and on Framta's death within a few months his followers are found led by Rechimund, though scholars dispute whether or not the two parties rejoined.Thompson, 167. In 457, while Framta was still ruling, Maldras led his people in a large raid on Lusitania. They sacked Lisbon by pretending to come in peace and, once admitted by the citizens, plundering the city.Thompson, 171. Maldras is also accused of having murdered his brother. In 458 he received envoys from the Visigoths and the Vandals. His people continued to plunder western Lusitania until Maldras was strangled, perhaps by his own men, in February 460. Maldras' people turned to Frumar as their war-leader then. Afterwards Remismund became king and reunited the Suevic people. He is claimed by Isidore of Seville to be a son of Maldras, but there is some doubt on this.Thompson, 218-219. == Sources == * Thompson, E. A.

JMOL is also known as a directed verdict, which it has replaced in American federal courts. JMOL is similar to judgment on the pleadings and summary judgment, all of which test the factual sufficiency of a claim. Judgment on the pleadings is a motion made after pleading and before discovery; summary judgment happens after discovery and before trial; JMOL occurs during trial. In United States federal courts, JMOL is a creation of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 50. JMOL is decided by the standard of whether a reasonable jury could find in favor of the party opposing the JMOL motion. If there is no evidence to support a reasonable conclusion for the opposing party, judgment is entered by the court and the case is over. If there is sufficient evidence to make a reasonable conclusion in favor of the opposing party, but there is equally strong evidence to support an opposite conclusion, the party with the burden of persuasion fails. Timing is very important in making a motion for JMOL; the motion can be made only after the opposing party has presented its case. In civil cases, the plaintiff presents its case, then the defendant presents its case, and then the plaintiff may present a rebuttal. So once the plaintiff has presented its case, the defendant can move for JMOL, but the plaintiff cannot. But once the defendant has finished presenting its case, the plaintiff can then move for JMOL, and so can the defendant. JMOL motions may also be made after the verdict is returned, where they are called \\"renewed\\" motions for judgment as a matter of law (RJMOL), but the motion is still commonly known by its former name, judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or JNOV (from the English judgment and the Latin non obstante veredicto). ==See also== *Judgment notwithstanding the verdict *New trial *No case to answer *Renewed judgment as a matter of law *Summary judgment ==References== Category:United States civil procedure Matter of law Category:American legal terminology ","title":"Judgment as a matter of law"},{"id":"3253096","text":"Theodemund was a Suevic King of Galicia between the years 469 and 550.

This disaster was similar to the North Sea flood of 1953, when an intense European windstorm coinciding with a high tide caused a huge storm surge. The St. Lucia flood had a major influence on the subsequent history of the Netherlands. ==Creation of Zuiderzee== The name Zuiderzee (\\"Southern Sea\\", from the Frisian perspective) dates from after this event, as the water had before been a freshwater lake that was only directly connected to the North Sea by the former river Vlie. The St. Lucia's flood removed the last of a series of natural sandy (dunes) and boulder clay barriers, after which the new, now salty Zuiderzee came into existence and grew rapidly, since the peatlands behind the former barriers were now mostly unprotected against erosion from the sea. The coming into existence of the Zuiderzee was the undoing of the powerful medieval trading city of Stavoren on the right bank of the now disappearing river Vlie, and the making of first the IJssel Hanse-cities of Kampen, Zwolle, Deventer, Zutphen, and Doesburg, and later the anti-Hanseatic city of Amsterdam, which began its rise from nothing almost immediately after the St. Lucia's flood. ==Netherlands (West-Frisia and Frisia proper)== Much land was permanently flooded in what is now the Waddenzee and IJsselmeer. It especially affected the north and northwestern part of the Netherlands, particularly the current provinces of Noord-Holland and Friesland. The island of Griend in the current Waddenzee saw serious destruction, with only ten houses left standing. After the flood, Harlingen, about 25 kilometres southeast of Griend and formerly landlocked, came into existence as the new seaport of Friesland, a role it kept for seven centuries. The only part of the current northwestern Netherlands, apart from the western Dunes area (the old Dutch heartland) and the Frisian Islands that escaped annihilation was West-Friesland, since this area was already protected by a ringdike that mostly held and where not, could be repaired after the floods receded. Shortly after the St. Lucia Day disaster, the West-Frisia, now separated from the rest of Friesland by a strait of around 15 kilometres at its narrowest, was annexed by the county of Holland, expanding this county northwards. The flood also brought the Friso-Hollandic Wars, which had lasted around 200 years, to an end. Shortly after this annexation, the West-Frisian cities of Hoorn and Enkhuizen began a rise to prominence that would last until the 17th century. ==In Germany (mostly East Frisia)== The Chronicles speak of 50,000 killed and total destruction. Many villages disappeared forever. In the current district of East-Frisia alone thirty villages disappeared in the North Sea. Also a first stage of the Dollart came into existence. Because of the large loss of land and the relative insecurity of living in the now far more unprotected peatlands, since natural barriers had been removed by the flood, many survivors gave up their ways of living in the fertile peatlands and moved to the Geest. ==In England== Although not known by the name of St. Lucia, the same storm also had devastating effects on the other side of the North Sea in England. It killed hundreds of people in England, e.g. in the village of Hickling, Norfolk, where 180 died and the water rose a foot above the high altar in the Priory Church. The storm is one of two in 1287 sometimes referred to as a \\"Great Storm\\". The other was the South England flood of February 1287. Together with a surge in January 1286, they seem to have prompted the decline of one of England's then leading ports, Dunwich in Suffolk. ==See also== *Floods in the Netherlands == References == # Gevaar van water, water in gevaar uit 2001 # Buisman, Jan, Duizend jaar weer, wind en water in de Lage Landen (Deel 1: tot 1300), == Notes == Category:Floods in the Netherlands Category:Floods in Germany Category:Floods in England Category:History of Lower Saxony Category:History of Schleswig-Holstein Category:13th-century floods Category:13th century in the Netherlands Category:Storm tides of the North Sea Category:1287 in Europe Category:1287 in England Category:Disasters in Suffolk Category:Medieval weather events Category:1280s in Germany ","title":"St. Lucia's flood"},{"id":"3253131","text":"Astro may refer to: == Entertainment and media == * Astro (South Korean band), a South Korean boy band * Astro (UB40) (born 1957), member of the British reggae band UB40 * Astro (Chilean band), a Chilean indie rock band * Astro (Japanese band), a Japanese noise music project * Astro (rapper) (born Brian Bradley, 1996), contestant on the first season of the U.S. version of The X Factor in 2011 * Astro (album), a 2011 album by Chilean band Astro * \\"Astro\\", a song by The White Stripes from their 1999 debut The White Stripes * Astro (The Jetsons), a dog character in the cartoon The Jetsons == Satellites == * ASTRO (satellite), the Autonomous Space Transport Robotic Operations vehicle, an American technology demonstration satellite * Project names of astronomy satellites by ISAS (now JAXA) **ASTRO-A or Hinotori (satellite), a solar X-ray astronomy satellite **ASTRO-B or Tenma, an X-ray astronomy satellite **ASTRO-C or Ginga (satellite), an X-ray astronomy satellite **ASTRO-D or Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA), an X-ray astronomy satellite **ASTRO-E, and ASTRO-EII or Suzaku (satellite), an X-ray astronomy satellite **ASTRO-F or Akari (satellite), formerly known as IRIS, an infrared astronomy satellite **ASTRO-G or VSOP-2, a canceled radio astronomy satellite project **ASTRO-H or Hitomi (satellite), formerly known as NeXT, an X-ray astronomy satellite == Science and medicine == * ASTRO (American Society for Radiation Oncology) or its annual conference * the Arctic Stratospheric Ozone Observatory (AStrO), now the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL) in Eureka, Canada * Astronomy ** Astrobiology ** Astrochemistry ** Astro-geodetic methods, a group of important methods in geodesy, satellite techniques and astrometry ** Astrometry ** Astrophysics ** Astropy == Sports and games== * Astro convention, a contract bridge bidding convention * Astrodome, a sports venue in Houston, Texas, and the first home of the Houston Astros * The Houston Astros, a Major League Baseball team == Television services == * Astro (television), All-Asian Satellite Television and Radio Operator, a Malaysian subscription-based multi-channel satellite TV and radio service ** Astro MAX, a former personal video recorder service for Astro (Malaysian satellite television) ** Astro Prima Malaysian pay television channel ** Astro Vaanavil Malaysian pay television channel in Tamil language ** Astro Wah Lai Toi (Astro ËèØÈ∫óÂè∞ in Traditional Chinese) a Cantonese television channel, operated by Astro (Malaysia) and HKB (Hong Kong) * Astro Malaysia Holdings, media holding company == Vehicles == * Chevrolet Astro, a \\"mid-size\\" van * GMC Astro, a cabover tractor-trailer truck made by GMC from 1968‚Äì1988 * Astro-Gnome, an American automobile == Other == * Adobe Flash Player version 10 * Astrology * Astro (Motorola), used to describe the digital voice radios produced by Motorola * Astro navigation, celestial navigation, positional astronomy, navigating by the stars * Astro yogourt, a Parmalat Canada product * Astro Teller (born 1970), scientist and entrepreneur == See also == * Astra (disambiguation) * Astro Arena (disambiguation) * Astros (disambiguation) ","title":"Astro"},{"id":"3253140","text":"Rajmund Fodor (born February 21, 1976 in Szeged) is a Hungarian water polo player, who played on the gold medal squads at the 2000 Summer Olympics and 2004 Summer Olympics.

Chiang disappeared on January 9, 1999, in Washington, D.C., and was later found dead. The story of her disappearance and the discovery of her remains in the Potomac River, which drew only local news coverage at the time, was rediscovered and received some national attention in the wake of the similar disappearance of Chandra Levy in May 2001. Chiang was the sister of former California State Treasurer John Chiang. == Life == Joyce Chiang was one of four children and the only daughter of Taiwanese immigrants raised in Chicago and in Southern California. Her three brothers are John Chiang, who became Controller of the State of California in 2007 and Treasurer of California in 2015; Robert Chiang; and Roger Chiang, who is currently the Executive In Charge at the television show America's Most Wanted and in 1999 lived with Joyce and was working for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Chiang attended Smith College, where she was student government president in 1992. She graduated from the evening division of Georgetown University Law School in 1995, while working for Congressman Howard Berman as an immigration advisor. After earning her law degree, she worked in the General Counsel's office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. == Disappearance and death == On January 9, 1999, the day of Chiang's disappearance, she had met with several friends for a movie and dinner, and one of those friends offered her a ride home. Chiang asked her friend to make one quick stop at the Starbucks at the intersection of Connecticut Avenue NW and R Street NW. Chiang told her friend that she would walk the four blocks home from the coffee shop, but she never made it to her apartment. Her brother Roger was her roommate and reported her missing. Because Chiang was a federal employee, the FBI took the lead in investigating the case. A couple walking through Anacostia Park the next day found Chiang's billfold and turned it in to park police, who filed it in the park's lost and found. Four days later, the couple recognized Chiang's photo in media coverage and alerted the FBI, who arranged a search of the park and discovered her apartment keys, video and grocery cards, and gloves. The jacket in which Chiang was last seen was also found, torn down the back. During the three-month span in which she was missing, a candlelight vigil was held every Saturday night in Dupont Circle. Her brother Roger was instrumental in several televised and print appeals for more information on her case and disappearance. Three months after the disappearance and eight miles away, a canoeist on the Potomac River found a badly decomposed body later identified through DNA analysis as Chiang's. The cause of death could not be determined, and for more than 12 years it was considered a cold case. In 2001, at the height of the media frenzy surrounding the disappearance of Chandra Levy, police had attempted to defrock a serial killer theory by stating that Chiang had committed suicide. Chiang's family turned to the media to dispel that notion. In January 2011, WTTG-Fox 5 reported that the police had solved Chiang's murder, identifying two suspects who had attempted to rob her on the night she disappeared. In May 2011, D.C. police held a press conference in which they acknowledged that Chiang had not committed suicide, but was instead the victim of a homicide. They said that one suspect was in prison in Maryland for a different offense, and another suspect was living in Guyana, which has no extradition treaty with the U.S. According to WTTG-Fox 5, an unnamed \\"source familiar with the case has identified the men as Steve Allen and Neil Joaquin, two men who worked as a team abducting people off the street with the intention of robbing them.\\" Partly based on similarities to another attack committed by the two men after Chiang's disappearance, police hypothesized that the men drove Chiang to the Anacostia River. On the day of the press conference, television host John Walsh stated that the men either threw Chiang into the river, or Chiang attempted to escape but slipped on the icy river bank and drowned. Although the police did not confirm or deny Walsh's theories, nor were any charges filed, Chiang's family expressed thanks for the closure of the case. == Chandra Levy connection == In addition to the Congressional intern connection, Chiang had lived only four blocks away from where Chandra Levy would later take up residency, in Dupont Circle. Both were young, brunette women of petite stature. The Starbucks where Chiang was last seen was later frequented by Levy. These similarities have led to various theories that both women were killed by the same person, although the Congressman-in-sex-scandal aspect of Levy's case, coupled with the long time that passed before her body was found, led to more media interest. == Remembrances == The Joyce Chiang Memorial Scholarship was established with the help of her family, to support one student each year with an internship at the Asian American Justice Center (AAJC) in Washington, D.C. The Joyce Chiang Memorial Award was established at Georgetown University Law Center by her friends and colleagues. It supports \\"an evening student with a demonstrable commitment to public service.\\" ==See also== *List of solved missing persons cases *List of unsolved deaths ==References== == External links == * Joe Harten, Georgetown Joins the Search For Missing Law School Alum, The Hoya, January 26, 1999 * Congressional Record, Farewell to Joyce Chiang, April 13, 1999 * Sam Chu Lin, Search for Chandra Levy Reopens Wounds for Family of Joyce Chiang, AsianWeek, July 27, 2001, page 11 Category:1970 births Category:1990s missing person cases Category:1999 deaths Category:20th-century American lawyers Category:American people of Taiwanese descent Category:American women of Taiwanese descent Category:Female murder victims Category:Formerly missing people found dead Category:Georgetown University Law Center alumni Category:Lawyers from Chicago Category:Missing person cases in Washington, D.C.

E7. == Career == Born in Toronto, Ontario, Wayne began his involvement in science fiction fandom in 1971 when he joined the Ontario Science Fiction Club (OSFiC). Over the years he contributed art and writing to a wide variety of amateur and semi-professional fanzines, as well as publishing his own‚ÄîRed Shift, Delta Psi, Synapse, New Toy and others. In the late 1980s he made the jump to professional illustration, by necessity working mainly outside the science fiction genre. A west coast American magazine called Ruralite was his main client at that time. During the 1990s Taral focused more on comic book work. His major achievement was the Furry comic title Tales of Beatrix Farmer (aka Beatrix) (Mu Press and Vision Comics). Created by Steve Gallacci, the stories were a collaborative effort‚Äîdrawn by Taral, co-written by creator and artist. They tell the story of Beatrix, an ordinary rabbit-girl who is wounded in a drive-by shooting. She is rescued by omnipotent alien beings (visible only to her), who ensure her future safety by wrapping her in a metallic suit that confers invulnerability. She soon discovers that it also renders her completely \\"safe\\" from bodily needs‚Äîfood, drink, sleep, sex, touch, taste, or smell. Forced into the role of superhero for hire, Beatrix yearns to be ordinary again or at least have the option of removing the suit when desired. Due to generally poor sales in the entire comics industry at the time of the Marvel Comics bankruptcy, the series was dropped after only a few issues. Thereafter the artist contributed short pieces to other comics as time and inclination permitted. Taral also created many back covers for Gremlin Trouble, a comic published by AB Pixilations. Significant work he has done within the SF genre includes the illustration of Rudy Rucker's novel Spaceland (Tor, 2002),(February 2002). \\"SF Fandom\\", Science Fiction Chronicle 23 (2): 13. restoration of Vaughn Bod√© art appearing in fanzines for Rare & Well Done Bode, research and illustration for John Robert Colombo's book Years of Light (Hounslow Press, 1982). He has also made contributions to The Fantasy Showcase Tarot Deck (Bruce Pelz, 1980) and Tank Vixens Card Game (United Publications, 2004). In addition to his art, Taral has sold a small number of articles and short stories, worked on TV and cartoon presentations, produced several CDs of art and fan writing, sold tee-shirts, and even designed a postal cancellation for the 1978 Worldcon. The bulk of Taral's career, though, has been the creation of art for private commissions, numbering more than 3,000 inked, coloured, or penciled works to date. He is currently working on private commissions and developing his writing as \\"retirement\\" looms. Taral currently resides in the Parkdale district of Toronto. While still possessing close ties to science fiction fandom, he is rather an outsider in the comics community. In early 2017 he suffered a stroke, from which he subsequently began a slow recovery.http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/8291380/ ==Notes== ==External links== * Taral Wayne's bio for Ttines.com * Taral Wayne's deviantART site * \\"I, Fanartist\\" by Taral Wayne in Challenger 22 fanzine Category:1951 births Category:Canadian comics writers Category:Furry fandom people Category:Living people Category:Science fiction fans Category:Writers from Toronto ","title":"Taral Wayne"},{"id":"3253195","text":"Dmitri Ivanovich Stratan (; born 24 January 1975) is a Soviet and Russian water polo forward.

After the Coffin family moved to Philadelphia, Martha was educated at Quaker schools. Martha Coffin Wright was the youngest of eight children some of her well-known siblings names were Sarah, Lucretia, Eliza, Mary, and Thomas. All of her siblings were born in Nantucket and she was the only born in Boston. When she was two years old, Martha moved to Philadelphia and lived there for a total of 15 years. While living in Philadelphia, she was influenced by her elder sisters and her mother. Her father died in 1815, at the age of 48, because he contracted typhus fever. After, spending 15 years in Philadelphia Martha moved to upstate New York where she lived for many years. She moved to Aurora, New York which is located near the Finger Lakes in November 1827. Martha's eldest sister Anna was a huge influence on the person she was. Anna was the one who sent Martha to school at the Westcott Boarding School in 1821. This was the same school that her three other siblings attended 10 years earlier.Penney, Sherry H. and Livingstone, James D. A Very Dangerous Woman: Martha Wright and Women's Rights. University of Massachusetts Press, 2004. ==Career== ===Seneca Falls Convention=== Martha's older sister Lucretia Coffin Mott was a prominent Quaker preacher. In July 1848, she visited Martha's home in Auburn, New York.Martha C Wright, nps.gov, Retrieved 16 August 2016 During that visit, Martha and Lucretia met with Elizabeth Cady Stanton at Jane Hunt's house and decided to hold a convention in nearby Seneca Falls, New York, to discuss the need for greater rights for women. The importance of the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women's rights convention, was recognized by Congress in 1980 with the creation of the Women's Rights National Historical Park at the site, administered by the National Park Service. The Park's Visitor Center today features a group of life-size bronze statues to honor the women and men who in 1848 initiated the organized movement for women's rights and woman suffrage. Her statue shows her, as she was then, visibly pregnant. In 2005, the park featured a display about the relationship between Lucretia and Martha. In 2008, the park featured a display focused on Martha. ===Women's rights and abolitionism=== right After the Seneca Falls Convention Martha Wright participated in a number of state conventions and the annual National Women's Rights Conventions in various capacities, often serving as President. She was also active in the abolition movement. The arguments for women's rights had much in common with the arguments for abolition. With her sister Lucretia, Martha attended the founding meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society in Philadelphia in 1833. In September 1852, Martha attended a convention in Syracuse, NY where she gave her first speech on women's rights. This very convention was where she was first introduced to Susan B. Anthony. Martha attended many conventions and lectures all the way until 1862, when the Civil War occurred. She felt it would be best to focus on the war. She still continued her fight for the American Anti-Slavery Society. ===Underground Railroad=== Martha's home in Auburn, New York, was part of the Underground Railroad where she harbored fugitive slaves. She became a close friend and supporter of Harriet Tubman. Martha and her husband David were influential in the movement to abolish slavery, and they shared this common interest with their close friends in Auburn, NY, the Seward family. William Henry Seward at the time was the elected governor of New York State. Seward's wife Frances Seward and his sister Lazette Worden became interested in the works of the Women's Right movement, but never actively were involved. ===Auburn, NY Home=== In 1839 the Wright family moved to 192 Genesee Street Auburn, NY. The house was very large and close to the courthouse. This was key for her husband David's career as a lawyer. The house would be a key part in housing slaves and important figures during the women's movement. Examples of such slaves and important figures were Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony.Penney, Sherry H. and Livingstone, James D. A Very Dangerous Woman: Martha Wright and Women's Rights. University of Massachusetts Press, 2004. .Chapter 5. Marker recognizing Wright ==Personal life== In 1824, Martha married Captain Peter Pelham (1785-1826) of Kentucky and moved with him to a frontier fort at Tampa Bay, Florida. They had a daughter. Peter died in July 1826, leaving Martha a nineteen-year-old widow with an infant child. She moved to upstate New York to teach painting and writing at a Quaker school for girls. Martha had six children, Marianna (whom she had with her first husband), Tallman, Eliza, Ellen, William, and Francis. After the death of her husband in 1826 she met a man by the name of Julius Catlin and continued to see him. In 1828, they both expressed their wish to become engaged and married. Yet, nothing ever came of the relationship because Julius's father did not approve of Martha and he met an early death in 1828. This was not the end of Martha's love life. In 1829, she met a man by the name of David Wright, a lawyer, and they were soon married; on November 18. David Wright was a Quaker just like Martha and was born and raised in Bucks County, PA.Penney, Sherry H. and Livingstone, James D. A Very Dangerous Woman: Martha Wright and Women's Rights. University of Massachusetts Press, 2004. .Chapter 2. Martha's daughter Ellen Wright (1840‚Äì1931) was an advocate of women's rights, especially women's suffrage. In 1864, she married William Lloyd Garrison, Jr. (1838‚Äì1909), a prominent advocate of Henry George's single tax movement, free trade, woman's suffrage, and of the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act. William was the son of abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison. ===Death=== Martha Coffin Wright died on January 4, 1875. She is buried in Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn, NY. ===Descendants=== Martha's granddaughter, Eleanor Garrison (1880‚Äì1974), the daughter of her daughter Ellen and her husband William, worked for the National American Woman Suffrage Association.

His first coach was Vladimir Kutataladze. After studying at the Tbilisi State University of Georgia he joined the diplomatic Academy. Although he got a diploma \\"Master Sporta\\" Waterpolo (2002). Soon the talented player got his first engagement abroad in Italy: first he played by \\"Rari Nantes Florentia\\" 1993-1997. After returning to Russia (Dinamo from 1997‚Äì2000) he got a special contract, which allowed him to study at the Moscow University in the economic departure. In 1997 he was the first time a member of the Russian National Squad. 1998 he played at the Goodwill Games. In 2000 he played again for one of the best clubs in Italy, Pro Recco, in the near of Genua (2000‚Äì2001). His engagement at Pro Recco wasn't so successful as it was awaited. So the last station abroad of the Russian Nationalplayer was at Mladost from Zagreb in Croatia where he has been for 3 seasons. Under the coach Ozren Bonaƒçiƒá he won the Croatian Champiosships with Mladost twice. One of his personal high-lights was when he scored the winning goal in the final of the FINA Cup 2002 against Hungary. In Athens 2004, Tchomakhidze made the difference in Russia's bronze medal victory. The right-hander's four goals lifted his team to a 6-5 win over Greece. Revaz Tchomakhidze decided to go back to Russia and he is still one of the best player in the young team of Sturm 2002 in Tchechow - a little town before the doors of Moskow. Although he is still a member of the Russian National Squad. When he was asked when he is going to stop his career he said that his wish would be to play until the Olympic Games in China 2008. In an interview with Novaja izvestija he showed himself very selfprowded: \\"¬´–ù–µ –±—É–¥—É —Å–∫—Ä–æ–º–Ω–∏—á–∞—Ç—å, —è ‚Äì –ª—É—á—à–∏–π –∏–≥—Ä–æ–∫ –ï–≤—Ä–æ–ø—ã¬ª\\" (Translation: I shall not be over- modest, I am the best player in Europe). In February 2007 shocked Tchomakhidze with the message, that he left the Nationalsquad one month before the World Championships in Melbourne, Australia. In an interview he said he feels very tired and needs a break. If he would return to the Russian team was still open. He was invited for the 2008 Qualification tournament in March, but he again cancelled his participation for the Russian National Squad. With his club Sthurm 2002 Chekhov he gained 2008 the first place in LEN Trophy. It was a big point for the Russian club, because it was the first International triumph for the young team. Til summer 2009 Revaz played for Chekhov. After his return in his native country Georgia he played in August 2009 on the B-European championship in Lugano and could help with it Georgia to the qualification. He took over the role of the youth younger generation trainer in the Georgian waterpolo association. His first success was the qualification for the youth European Championship in Stuttgart 2010. ==Achievements== * 1989: European Youth Championship Istanbul/Turkey, 5.

K., as a consumer version of the professional Nikon brand. Nikkormat cameras, produced from 1965 until 1978, were simpler and more affordable than Nikon-branded cameras, but accepted the same lenses as the Nikon F series cameras. == The Nikkormat F-series == ===Nikkormat FT=== Nikkormat FT SLR camera with Fisheye-NIKKOR 1:5,6 f=7,5mm and finder The Nikkormat FT was an all-metal, mechanically (springs, gears, levers) controlled, manual focus SLR with match-needle exposure control, manufactured in Japan from 1965 to 1967. It was available in two colors: black with chrome trim and all black. The unmetered version was designated \\"Nikkormat FS.\\" The FT had dimensions of 95 mm height, 146 mm width, 54 mm depth and 745 g weight. This was larger and heavier than most competing amateur level SLRs of the mid-1960s, such as the Asahi (Honeywell in the USA) Pentax Spotmatic of 1964, but the quality of the internal components gave the FT strength and durability. The FT used a metal-bladed, vertical travel, focal plane shutter with a speed range of 1 to 1/1000 second plus Bulb and flash X-sync of 1/125th second. The Nikkormat F-series had a shutter speed ring concentric with the lens mount, unlike Nippon Kogaku's other manual focus SLRs with a top mounted shutter speed dial. The FT's exposure control system was a \\"center-the-needle\\" system using a galvanometer needle pointer moving vertically at the lower right side of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in, open aperture, TTL, full-scene averaging, cadmium sulfide (CdS) light meter versus the actual camera settings. The photographer would adjust the shutter speed to freeze or blur motion and/or the lens aperture f-stop to control depth of field (focus) until the needle was centered between two pincer-like brackets. The needle array was duplicated in a window next the top-mounted film rewind crank to allow exposure control without looking through the viewfinder. The meter was turned on by pulling the film wind lever out to the standby ready position and turned off by pushing it back flush against the camera. This was very advanced in 1965 and proved to be remarkably long-lived. Nippon Kogaku used it for all versions of the Nikkormat FT with incremental improvements. The Nikon FM, FM2 and FM2N of the succeeding Nikon compact F-series SLRs used an improved viewfinder only, center-the-LED system until 2001. The FT's viewfinder also had a fixed focusing screen with Nippon Kogaku's then standard central 4 mm microprism focusing aid plus 12 mm matte focusing surface. The Nikkormat FT accepted all lenses with the Nikon F bayonet mount (introduced in 1959 on the Nikon F camera) and a \\"meter coupling shoe\\" (or prong, informally called \\"rabbit ears\\"). The FT had a mirror lockup allowing its use with some specialised lenses for which an auxiliary viewfinder was provided. The FT was Nippon Kogaku's first SLR with a built-in TTL light meter. As such, Nippon Kogaku could not find a way to automatically synchronize their Nikkor Auto lenses' aperture information with the FT body. Therefore, mounting lenses required a special preparatory procedure. First, the lens' maximum aperture (smallest f-stop number) must set against the film speed scale on the FT's shutter speed ring. Then, the \\"meter coupling pin\\" on the ring surrounding the FT's lens mount flange must pushed all the way to the right and the lens' aperture ring must be preset to f/5.6 to line up the \\"meter coupling shoe\\" with the pin for mounting. Note that the lens maximum aperture had to be reset every time the lens was changed. This was very inconvenient compared to some other SLRs of the 1960s. Note that modern AF Nikkor autofocusing lenses (introduced 1986) do not have a meter coupling shoe, but all non-G AF lenses have two pilot holes to retrofit the coupling shoe, making them 100% compatible with all Nikon F-mount cameras. Although most AF Nikkor lenses will mount and manually focus on the FT, the combination cannot provide open aperture metering; only stop down metering. Nikon's most recent 35 mm film SLR lenses, the AF Nikkor G type (2000) lacking an aperture control ring; and the AF Nikkor DX type (2003) with image circles sized for Nikon's digital SLRs will mount, but will not function properly at all. The FT also had two PC terminals to synchronize with flash units: an M-sync to all speeds for M and FP type (1/60 second for MF type) flashbulbs and an X-sync to 1/125th second for electronic flashes using guide number manual exposure control. However, the FT did not have a built-in accessory shoe to mount flash units. The \\"Nikkormat accessory shoe\\" must be screwed to the top of the pentaprism cover via the eyepiece first. Note that this shoe only mounts the flash. A PC cord must still be plugged into the appropriate PC terminal. This was normal for most SLRs of the 1960s. Rare Nikkormat FS with NIKKOR-H Auto 1:2 f=50mm lens ===Nikkormat FS=== The Nikkormat FS, manufactured from 1965 to 1971, was an FT stripped of the built-in light meter with its exposure information system and the mirror lockup feature. The FS was unpopular when new because of the lack of a built-in meter, but this makes it rarer and more valuable than the FTs to collectors today. ===Nikkormat FTN=== Nikomat FTN The Nikkormat FTN was manufactured from 1967 to 1975. It simplified the lens mounting procedure of the rabbit ear Nikkor lenses. The meter coupling pin on the camera still had to be aligned with the meter coupling shoe on the lens, but the lens maximum aperture no longer had to be manually preset on the FTN. Instead, the lens aperture ring had to be turned back and forth to the smallest aperture (largest f-stop number) and then to the largest (smallest number) immediately after mounting to ensure that the lens and the FTN couple properly (Nippon Kogaku called it indexing the maximum aperture of the lens) and meter correctly. This system seems unwieldy to today's photographers, but it was more efficient and easier than before, and became second nature to Nikon and Nikkormat photographers of the 1960s and 1970s. In addition, the FTN improved the metering system to the now classic Nikon 60/40 percent centerweighted style. The viewfinder also added +/‚Äì over/underexposure metering markers and set shutter speed information. The FTN also offered a choice (made at purchase time or by replacement at factory service centers) of brighter fixed viewfinder focusing screens: Nippon Kogaku's standard Type J with central 4 mm microprism focusing aid plus 12 mm etched circle indicating the area of the meter centerweighting or the Type A with central 3 mm split image rangefinder plus 12 mm etched circle. The front and back of the Nikon Nikkormat FT2 ===Nikkormat FT2=== The Nikkormat FT2, manufactured from 1975 to 1977, added a permanently affixed hot shoe to the top of the pentaprism cover, combined the two PC terminals into one and switched the light meter battery to a non-toxic silver cell, one 1.5 V S76 or SR44. ASA adjustment also featured a lock and an easier slider than previous models. The advance lever was more contoured with an added plastic grip. The FT2's viewfinder also switched to Nippon Kogaku's new standard Type K focusing screen with 3 mm split image rangefinder and 1 mm microprism collar focusing aids plus 12 mm etched circle indicating the area of the meter centerweighting. A final small touch was the addition of \\"+\\" and \\"-\\" symbols on the display of the top meter read-out. The numerous little improvements on the FT2 directly reflected customer suggestions for the FTn. ===Nikkormat FT3=== The Nikkormat FT3, manufactured for only several months in 1977 (but still available new from dealer stock in 1978), had the shortest production run of any Nippon Kogaku SLR. The FT3 was essentially identical to the FT2 except that it supported Nikkor lenses with the Automatic Indexing (AI) feature (introduced 1977). AI Nikkor lenses had an external \\"meter coupling ridge\\" cam on the lens aperture ring that pushed on an external \\"meter coupling lever\\" on a ring surrounding the FT3's lens mount flange to transfer lens set aperture information. Note that most AF Nikkor autofocusing lenses are also AI types. They will mount and meter properly under manual focus on the FT3. However, Nikon's most recent SLR lenses, the AF Nikkor G and AF Nikkor DX types, are not AI types. They will mount, but will not function properly. The FT3 was little more than a stopgap placeholder, awaiting the release of the first of the completely redesigned Nikon compact F-series SLRs, the all-new Nikon FM, with a more compact chassis, in late 1977. The metering system was considered one of the best on the market at the time, as the Nikkormat FT3 remained a very popular camera with professionals and amateurs alike. == The Nikkormat EL-series == Nikkormat EL ===Nikkormat EL=== The Nikkormat EL was an all-metal, electromechanically (some solid-state electronics, but mostly springs, gears and levers) controlled, manual-focus SLR with manual exposure control or aperture-priority autoexposure, manufactured in Japan from 1972 to 1976. It was available in two colors: black with chrome trim and all black. The EL had dimensions of 93.5 mm height, 145 mm width, 54.5 mm depth and 780 g weight. This was large and heavy compared to many other SLRs of the mid-1970s. As Nippon Kogaku's first electronic autoexposure camera, the EL required a battery (one 6V PX28 or one 4SR44 in the bottom of the mirror box) to power its electronically-controlled, metal- bladed, vertical-travel, focal-plane shutter with a speed range of four seconds to 1/1000 second (plus Bulb and flash X-sync at 1/125th second). Nikkormat EL Match-needle Display The battery also powered the camera's coupled 'match-needle' exposure metering system. This consisted of two needles pointing along a vertical shutter-speed scale visible in the viewfinder. In manual mode, a black needle pointed out the shutter speed recommended by the built-in 60/40 percent centerweighted, cadmium sulfide (CdS) light meter, while a translucent green needle showed the current (actual) shutter speed setting of the camera. The photographer would then adjust the shutter speed and/or the lens aperture until the needles aligned, at which point correct exposure would be achieved. In automatic mode, the EL's black needle indicated the shutter speed automatically set by the camera in response to the light available and the lens aperture set by the user. The green needle just indicated that the EL was in \\"A\\" mode. Setting a manual-exposure camera to expose the film properly takes two steps, even after taking a light meter reading. Autoexposure systems that greatly simplified the process were a boon when first introduced in the Konica AutoReflex (Autorex in Japan) in 1965. Nikon's autoexposure system was advanced at the EL's launch in 1972, and proved to be long-lived. Nippon Kogaku/Nikon continued to use aperture- priority autoexposure, with considerable development, in the Nikon FE, FE2 and FM3A of the succeeding Nikon compact F-series SLRs until 2006. In common with other manufacturers' first-generation electronic autoexposure SLRs, the EL had a reputation for rapidly draining batteries; later models had much more energy-efficient electronics. Note that the EL would still function without batteries in a very limited fashion: fully mechanical operation, with only one shutter speed available (an unmarked, fixed 1/90 second) and without the light meter. Like the contemporary Nikkormat FTN (see above), the EL accepted all 'rabbit-ear' Nikkor lenses (requiring a double-twist of the lens aperture ring on mounting), and its viewfinder had a choice of Type J or Type A fixed focusing-screens. ===Nikkormat ELW=== The Nikkormat ELW, manufactured from 1976 to 1977, was an EL modified to accept the Nikon AW-1 autowinder, providing motorized film advance at up to two frames per second. The ELW also expanded the automatic shutter speed range to eight seconds, and its viewfinder was fitted with a new standard focusing screen, the Type K (see the Nikkormat FT2 above). ===Nikon EL2=== The Nikon EL2 was manufactured from 1977 to 1978 and was essentially identical to the ELW, but with the addition of instant response silicon photodiode light meter sensors and support for Nikkor lenses with the new Automatic Indexing (AI) feature (see the Nikkormat FT3 above). The EL2 also abandoned the Nikkormat name (the Nikkormat FT3 being the last of the Nikkormat line) which had distinguished these cameras from the better known Nikon-badged models. The Nikon EL2 was replaced after a year of production by the Nikon FE. == Design history == In 1959, Nippon Kogaku released its first 35 mm SLR, the professional level Nikon F. The F combined every SLR technological advance available in 1959 (automatic diaphragm lenses, instant return mirror and eye-level pentaprism viewfinder) into an integrated package with mechanical durability and reliability, plus optical quality. It also offered the most complete system of accessories in the world, including interchangeable viewfinder heads, viewfinder screens, motor drives, flashbulb units, bulk film backs and eventually over fifty Nikkor lenses. The F quickly became a preferred 35 mm camera among professional photographers, especially photojournalists and amateurs who could afford them. However, the professional SLR market is a small market. The Nikon F with Nikkor 50 mm f/2 lens had a list price of US$359.50 in 1959 when new cars sold in the US$2500 range. Many amateur photographers could not afford Nikon cameras. Nippon Kogaku had tried offering a consumer grade camera-brand; beginning in 1963 the Nikkorex SLR was made by Mamiya but marketed by Nippon Kogaku and its distributors. Initially these cameras had fixed lenses and built-in metering, but in 1963 the Nikkorex F (made by Mamiya) was introduced; this was fully compatible with Nikkor F-mount lenses and had a look similar to the Nikon F style, though it was a larger camera. Despite reasonable quality in the later production, the Nikkorex brand was a marketing failure. Nippon Kogaku's second attempt at a consumer camera-line was designed and manufactured completely in-house. The Nikkormat FS and FT of 1965 were similar in size and weight to the Nikon F, had a pentaprism viewfinders, and were fully compatible with the F-mount lenses. The more expensive Nikkormat FT offered through-the-lens exposure- metering. However these had fewer professional-level features compared to the Nikon F, these had a fixed viewfinders and did not accept motor drives. Nippon Kogaku achieved some success with amateurs, but by the mid-1970s the remaining Nikkormat models were rebadged as Nikons and the line ended. == Current status == The Nikkormat F-series are today considered classic designs and are still favorites among film photographers. Assuming that they are not abused, Nikkormats suffer very few mechanical failures for an amateur level SLR. They generally need only the occasional cleaning, lubrication and adjustment (CLA) to continue normal operations even today, thirty to forty years after production, similar to other mechanical Japanese SLRs of the era, such as the Canon FTb, Pentax Spotmatic, and Minolta SR-T 101. However, the F-series are not indestructible ‚Äì especially the meter electronics. When they do break or wear out, repair may be difficult, requiring cannibalizing other F bodies, though CLA and repair services are still available. The Nikkormat EL-series were also tough and reliable, but as with all first generation autoexposure SLRs, they are not considered as handy as later generations with better electronics. With the size and weight of older mechanical SLRs, but with fewer features than succeeding autoexposure SLRs, the ELs are not as popular today as the newer Nikon FE and FE2. Nikkormats are still readily available on the second hand market, and can usually be found for US$50‚Äì200, depending on the exact model. The FS, AI type and all-black bodies are relatively rare and carry a premium. Nikkormats are collected and pristine examples are difficult to come by. == References == * \\"Nikon MF/AF Bodies ‚Äì Lens Compatibility\\" http://www.nikonlinks.com/unklbil/bodylens.htm retrieved 3 January 2006 * Anonymous. \\"Nikon EM: Budget Priced 35mm Reflex\\" pp 62‚Äì66.

She had a steel hull, measured (also cited as 11,358 DWT), , beam and depth.) The ship's construction was canceled in 1919 but she was then completed to a larger and different design than the originally planned Design 1013 and launched 24 February 1921. She was evaluated for naval use with a temporary designation of IX-4490. ==Peacetime service== After delivery the ship was operated by the Williams, Diamond & Company, Pacific Coast shippers for the Pacific Coast-European trade. Cargo handling equipment had been designed in light of the fact that many ports lacked sufficient handling equipment ashore to enable efficient cargo operations and initial service demonstrated increased efficiency. West Lewark and sister ship, West Faralon were placed in the company's Pacific Coast-European trade with West Lewark making an initial port call at Glasgow, Scotland. In 1922 the Army acquired the ship and renamed her Meigs. USAT Meigs was one of the small fleet the Army maintained during the inter-war years and operated in the Pacific as a freight and animal transport. In 1939, with USAT Ludington, Meigs was one of only two Army owned freight transports. Included in the requirement to transport army goods and personal possessions of personnel changing duty stations to the Pacific was transport of cavalry and personal horses of officers with occasional mention of the ship transporting notable horses or owners transferring between Pacific and continental postings. In July 1938 Meigs found an oil slick along the course of the lost Pan American flying boat Hawaii Clipper about 500 miles from Manila, took samples and stood by for further investigation. ==War service== Shortly before the US entry into World War II, the ship was given the tentative Navy hull number AK-34 under an agreement that Navy would take over then commission and crew any Army transports operating in areas of potential naval opposition. The reality of war resulted in a December 1941 Presidential order suspending that agreement and the hull number is listed by Navy as \\"not used.\\" USAT Meigs was part of the Pensacola Convoy attempting to reinforce the Philippines in the early stages of the Pacific War and held at Fiji when it was evident the Japanese were already invading the Philippines. Despite a military decision to bring the convoy back to Hawaii or the West Coast, a presidential decision routed the ships to Australia to attempt Philippine support from there. After being part of an abortive convoy escorted by and smaller escorts, that had departed on 15 February 1942 in an attempt to reinforce the island of Timor, she returned to the Australian town of Darwin, Northern Territory. On 19 February 1942 Japanese aircraft attacked Darwin's land and shipping targets in two waves. The Meigs was one of six ships sunk, with one of its crew of 66 killed, after being struck by a number of bombs and aerial torpedoes. ==Wreck== Although the superstructure of the wreck was salvaged after the war by Fujita Salvage of Osaka, Japan, the cargo of munitions, railway rails, Bren gun carriers and trucks intended for Allied forces in Portuguese Timor remains. The Meigs is now a dive site, where the remnants of the cargo are as visible as the remains of the vessel itself. It lies in of water at coordinates , and due to the large tidal movements creating strong currents and poor visibility, is only divable around neap tides. ==Namesakes== The name USS Meigs is incorrectly applied to the USAT Meigs and also, properly, to the , which served in the Korean War. There was also a small Quartermaster Corps passenger and freight steamer built in 1892 by John H. Dialogue & Son, Camden New Jersey, and serving in the early 20th century named General Meigs. ==References== ==See also== * List of ships sunk by the Imperial Japanese Navy ==External links== * The Bombing of Darwin * Australian War Memorial, photograph P05303.019 * The war at home: Second World War shipwrecks in Australian waters Category:1921 ships Category:Design 1133 ships of the United States Army Category:Ships built in Los Angeles Category:Ships sunk in the bombing of Darwin, 1942 Category:Maritime incidents in February 1942 Category:Transport ships of the United States Army Category:World War II auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Wreck diving sites ","title":"USAT Meigs"},{"id":"3253261","text":"Louis Malcolm (Mal) Boyd, popularly known as L.

Boyd (June 9, 1927 in Spokane, Washington, USA ‚Äì January 22, 2007, in Seattle) was a newspaper columnist whose nationally syndicated column was a collection of miscellaneous trivial and amusing facts. Boyd was raised in Chimacum and Bremerton, Washington. He joined the Army at the age of 16 and worked for the Stars and Stripes. After having worked at the (Spokane) Spokesman-Review, the New York Post, the San Francisco Chronicle and San Francisco Examiner, and the Houston Chronicle, in 1963 he moved to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, where he began his trivia column. The column ran locally under the name Mike Mailway, the name Mailway having been derived from the digits in Boyd's telephone number at the Post-Intelligencer. In 1968 it was picked up by the San Francisco Chronicle, where it was renamed The Grab Bag, the name by which it is most commonly known, though it ran under other titles in other markets. It eventually appeared in nearly 400 newspapers. Grab Bag often featured the occasional asides of \\"Our Love and War Man,\\" a character that presented items developed by him with his wife, Patricia. Boyd was \\"Love\\" and his wife \\"War\\"‚Äîalthough his wife Patricia maintained it was the other way around‚Äîhe told Chronicle writer Sam Whiting in 2000. To another reporter Boyd said that \\"sometimes he's the Love part, sometimes [Patricia] is.\\" The column led to the formation of Crown Syndicate by Boyd and his wife, which went on to offer several other columns and puzzles. The couple met in 1960, when Mr. Boyd was writing a column for the Houston Chronicle called Dial Watchem, which fielded reader complaints about broken signs and potholes. He had hired Patricia as an assistant. They were married 45 years and raised her six children. Boyd also had three children from a previous marriage. Boyd announced his retirement at the end of 2000, but popular demand brought the column back for a few more years.

The forest has an area of over 1.25 million acres (5,066 km¬≤) and is managed by the Forest Service. Forest headquarters are located in Custer, South Dakota. There are local ranger district offices in Custer, Rapid City, and Spearfish in South Dakota, and in Sundance, Wyoming.USFS Ranger Districts by State Predominantly ponderosa pine, the forest also includes hard woods like aspen, bur oak, and birch. The lower elevations include grassland prairie, but the National Forest System lands encompass most of the mountainous region known as the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming. Within the forest is Black Elk Peak which is the tallest mountain in South Dakota and the highest peak east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States. ==History== Fire tower atop Black Elk Peak After a series of devastating wildfires in 1893, U.S. President Grover Cleveland created the Black Hills Forest Reserve on February 22, 1897. U.S. President William McKinley issued a presidential proclamation on September 19, 1898 appending the Black Hills Forest Reserve geographic boundaries while acknowledging the forest preservation decrees established by the Timber Culture Act and Forest Reserve Act of 1891. Upon the creation of the Forest Service in 1905, the reserve was transferred to the new agency under the United States Department of Agriculture and redesignated as a National Forest two years later. Lakota words pah√° s√°pa meaning \\"hills that are black\\" (literally \\"black hills\\" as the adjectives (s√°pa) follow the noun) may be one of the factors in the regions naming. Early settlers and explorers called the Laramie Range the Black Hills prior to Lt. G. K. Warren's expedition in 1857. Prior to explorations by the La Verendrye brothers in 1742, many tribes frequented the Black Hills including Ponca, Kiowa Apache, Arapaho, Kiowa and Cheyenne for at least the past 10,000 years. The smallpox epidemics of 1771 to 1781 broke the will of the Arikara who prior to that time held the Sioux east of the Missouri. American Horse's winter count of 1775-76 is interpreted as depicting the Sioux discovery of the Black Hills.Raymond J. DeMallie, Jr., 2006. The mountains and other key features in and around the Black Hills and now within the Forest were considered sacred to indigenous peoples and many came here on vision quests, for hunting and for trade. ==Geography== The forest is located in parts of seven counties in South Dakota and Wyoming. In descending order of forestland area they are Pennington, Custer, Lawrence, Crook, Fall River, Meade, and Weston counties. (Crook and Weston are the only counties in Wyoming; only one-seventh of the forest acreage lies in Wyoming.) Table 6 - NFS Acreage by State, Congressional District and County - United States Forest Service - September 30, 2007 The Forest is located immediately west and south of Rapid City and can be accessed from Interstate 90. The forest headquarters is located in Custer, South Dakota. The Peter Norbeck National Scenic Byway passes through the forest in proximity to Mount Rushmore and along with the Spearfish Canyon National Forest Scenic Byway, provide two of the more scenic drives in the Country. Although surrounded by Black Hills National Forest, both Jewel Cave National Monument and Mount Rushmore National Memorial are separate areas administered by the National Park Service. Wind Cave National Park, which is another area administered by the National Park Service, borders portions of the forest in the southeast. Black Elk Wilderness is a wilderness within the Forest and no motorized transport is permitted. Outside of the wilderness, mining, logging, and ranching are permitted on public lands through land leases with companies and private parties, referred to as \\"permittees.\\" The Black Hills National Forest encompasses three distinct mountain ranges: the Black Hills and the Elk Mountains in South Dakota as well as the Bear Lodge Mountains in Wyoming. The Black Hills are by far the largest of the three ranges. ==Flora and fauna== While ponderosa pine is the most common tree species found in the forest, spruce can be found in the higher elevations. Elk, mule deer, pronghorn and white-tailed deer are commonly seen. Black bears have been spotted in the Black Hills. Cougars are increasing dramatically as a result of prolific herds of deer and elk. Coyotes, bighorn sheep and mountain goats are also frequently seen by visitors. Bald eagles, hawks, osprey, peregrine falcon and another two hundred species of birds can be found in this forest, especially along streams and near water sources. ==Recreation== 30 campgrounds are located in the forest and there are 11 reservoirs that are well stocked for sport fishing. 450 miles (725 km) of hiking trails provide access to more remote destinations and to the summit of Black Elk Peak. With over of Forest system roads, the Forest is also a haven for motorized travel. ==Gallery== File:20121015-FS-UNK-0022 (8100105565).jpgThe Bear and Beaver Gulches Botanical Area File:Black Hills National Forest - Social 1.jpgHikers on the Deerfield Trail File:Black Hills National Forest Districts Map.pdfA map of the Ranger Districts File:CusterCountySD ColdSpringsSchoolhouse.jpgThe Cold Springs Schoolhouse in Custer County File:Lake Dorn in the Black Hills of South Dakota - NARA - 286070.jpgLake Dorn circa 1940 ==ReferencesCategory:National Forests of South Dakota Category:National Forests of Wyoming Category:Lakota Category:Protected areas of Pennington County, South Dakota Category:Protected areas of Custer County, South Dakota Category:Protected areas of Lawrence County, South Dakota Category:Protected areas of Crook County, Wyoming Category:Protected areas of Fall River County, South Dakota Category:Protected areas of Meade County, South Dakota Category:Protected areas of Weston County, Wyoming Category:Protected areas established in 1897 Category:1897 establishments in South Dakota Category:1897 establishments in Wyoming ","title":"Black Hills National Forest"},{"id":"3253287","text":"Hi-Point Firearms, also known as Strassell's Machine, Inc (distributed by MKS Supply), is an American firearms manufacturer based in Mansfield, Ohio. All of their firearms are manufactured in the United States, in several different locations in Ohio. ==Construction of products== ===Pistols=== A Hi-Point JCP pistol Hi-Point semi-automatic pistols are polymer framed and generally regarded as simple, inexpensive handguns, which trade-off aesthetics for lower manufacturing cost. Based on a simple blowback design, Hi-Point pistols do not have a breech-locking system like most handguns. Instead they have large, heavy slides that hold the breech closed through sheer mass. The result is a heavier gun, for its size, that is bulkier and may be less aesthetically appealing than designs employing recoil operation. While making the pistols heavier, this design also makes them mechanically simple and easy to maintain. Hi-Point recommends hosing out the action with a powder solvent like Break Free Powder Blast, Rem Oil or another aerosol solvent every 300 to 400 rounds, then running a cleaning brush through the bore. Many semi-automatic pistols can be field stripped without the use of any tools. However, Hi-Point pistols require a small punch or a small screwdriver and a hammer to remove a pin in the receiver, in order to permit slide removal (and thus enable field- stripping). Rather than being machined from forged steel, the slide is die cast from Zamak-3 (A traditional zinc alloy, also popularly referred to as pot metal or white metal). When asked why die-casting was chosen as a manufacturing technique, a Hi-Point representative responded, \\"In the area of Ohio where we are located, there are many shops that specialize in die casting for the auto industry. We utilize this resource.\\" Uncommon for this construction, they are rated for +P ammunition in calibers up to .45 ACP. Blowback designs are generally simpler in design and easier and cheaper to manufacture than locked-breech recoil-operated firearms. And while the fixed barrel of a blowback gun generally will contribute to improved accuracy, blowback guns usually need to be larger and heavier than a locked-breech gun firing the same caliber. ===Carbines=== The Hi-Point carbine is a series of pistol-caliber carbines manufactured by Hi-Point Firearms chambered, for 9√ó19mm Parabellum, .40 S&W;, 10mm Auto, .45 ACP and .380 ACP handgun cartridges. They are very inexpensive, constructed using polymers and alloyed metals as much as possible, resulting in a reduction of production costs and sale price. It functions via a simple direct blowback action. Hi-Point carbines use a polymer stock, stamped sheet metal receiver cover, and a receiver and bolt cast from Zamak-3. The barrel is steel and button rifled using a 1-10\\" right hand twist. ===Use of zinc alloy=== Some people are wary of Hi-Points because of the use of zinc alloy (Zamak-3) castings in much of their construction. However, the parts made from Zamak-3 in Hi-Point guns (the receiver and bolt/slide) are low-stress components that do not require the strength of steel at these pistol cartridge power levels. Higher stress and wear components in Hi-Points, like the barrel, chamber, breech and other small parts, are made of steel. ==Calibers== Hi-Point manufactures firearms in the following calibers: * .380 ACP ‚Äì Model CF-380 and 380COMP * 9√ó19mm Parabellum ‚Äì C-9 and C-9 COMP pistols and YC-9 * .40 S&W; ‚Äì Model JCP pistol * .45 ACP ‚Äì Model JHP pistol * Hi-Point Carbines chambered in .380 ACP, 9mm Luger, .40 S&W;, 10mm Auto, and .45 ACP ==Safety== Hi-Point firearms have a manual thumb safety and an integral drop safety that prevents firing in the event that the firearm is dropped. Until recently, all Hi-Point products except the 995 (9mm) carbine had a last-round lock open and magazine disconnect safety, preventing firing unless a magazine was in the gun. With the replacement of the original 9mm carbine with the new 995 TS model, all pistols and carbines now have these features. ==Gallery== File:380 acp.jpgHi-Point CF380 pistol with two-tone finish; the C-9 is identical except it is simply black, and chambered for 9x19mm Parabellum File:Hipoint1.jpgHi-Point C380 pistol with the slide locked back File:Hp995carbine22.jpg\\"Generation 1\\" 995 Hi-Point Carbine ==ReferencesMKS Supply's website * Instruction Sheet for C9 and CF380 Pistols * Instruction manual for 40 S&W; and 45acp Pistols Category:Firearm manufacturers of the United States Category:Companies based in Ohio ","title":"Hi-Point Firearms"},{"id":"3253299","text":"Ecological analysis of CO2 in an ecosystem Systems ecology is an interdisciplinary field of ecology, a subset of Earth system science, that takes a holistic approach to the study of ecological systems, especially ecosystems. Systems ecology can be seen as an application of general systems theory to ecology. Central to the systems ecology approach is the idea that an ecosystem is a complex system exhibiting emergent properties. Systems ecology focuses on interactions and transactions within and between biological and ecological systems, and is especially concerned with the way the functioning of ecosystems can be influenced by human interventions. It uses and extends concepts from thermodynamics and develops other macroscopic descriptions of complex systems. ==Overview== Systems ecology seeks a holistic view of the interactions and transactions within and between biological and ecological systems. Systems ecologists realise that the function of any ecosystem can be influenced by human economics in fundamental ways. They have therefore taken an additional transdisciplinary step by including economics in the consideration of ecological-economic systems. In the words of R.L. Kitching: * Systems ecology can be defined as the approach to the study of ecology of organisms using the techniques and philosophy of systems analysis: that is, the methods and tools developed, largely in engineering, for studying, characterizing and making predictions about complex entities, that is, systems.. * In any study of an ecological system, an essential early procedure is to draw a diagram of the system of interest ... diagrams indicate the system's boundaries by a solid line. Within these boundaries, series of components are isolated which have been chosen to represent that portion of the world in which the systems analyst is interested ... If there are no connections across the systems' boundaries with the surrounding systems environments, the systems are described as closed. Ecological work, however, deals almost exclusively with open systems. As a mode of scientific enquiry, a central feature of Systems Ecology is the general application of the principles of energetics to all systems at any scale. Perhaps the most notable proponent of this view was Howard T. Odum - sometimes considered the father of ecosystems ecology. In this approach the principles of energetics constitute ecosystem principles. Reasoning by formal analogy from one system to another enables the Systems Ecologist to see principles functioning in an analogous manner across system-scale boundaries. H.T. Odum commonly used the Energy Systems Language as a tool for making systems diagrams and flow charts. The fourth of these principles, the principle of maximum power efficiency, takes central place in the analysis and synthesis of ecological systems. The fourth principle suggests that the most evolutionarily advantageous system function occurs when the environmental load matches the internal resistance of the system. The further the environmental load is from matching the internal resistance, the further the system is away from its sustainable steady state. Therefore, the systems ecologist engages in a task of resistance and impedance matching in ecological engineering, just as the electronic engineer would do. ==Closely related fields== ===Deep ecology=== Deep ecology is an ideology whose metaphysical underpinnings are deeply concerned with the science of ecology. The term was coined by Arne Naess, a Norwegian philosopher, Gandhian scholar, and environmental activist. He argues that the prevailing approach to environmental management is anthropocentric, and that the natural environment is not only \\"more complex than we imagine, it is more complex than we can imagine.\\"A statement attributed to British biologist J.B.S. Haldane Naess formulated deep ecology in 1973 at an environmental conference in Budapest. Joanna Macy, John Seed, and others developed Naess' thesis into a branch they called experiential deep ecology. Their efforts were motivated by a need they perceived for the development of an \\"ecological self\\", which views the human ego as an integrated part of a living system that encompasses the individual. They sought to transcend altruism with a deeper self-interest based on biospherical equality beyond human chauvinism. ===Earth systems engineering and management=== Earth systems engineering and management (ESEM) is a discipline used to analyze, design, engineer and manage complex environmental systems. It entails a wide range of subject areas including anthropology, engineering, environmental science, ethics and philosophy. At its core, ESEM looks to \\"rationally design and manage coupled human-natural systems in a highly integrated and ethical fashion\\" ===Ecological economics=== Ecological economics is a transdisciplinary field of academic research that addresses the dynamic and spatial interdependence between human economies and natural ecosystems. Ecological economics brings together and connects different disciplines, within the natural and social sciences but especially between these broad areas. As the name suggests, the field is made up of researchers with a background in economics and ecology. An important motivation for the emergence of ecological economics has been criticism on the assumptions and approaches of traditional (mainstream) environmental and resource economics. ===Ecological energetics=== Ecological energetics is the quantitative study of the flow of energy through ecological systems. It aims to uncover the principles which describe the propensity of such energy flows through the trophic, or 'energy availing' levels of ecological networks. In systems ecology the principles of ecosystem energy flows or \\"ecosystem laws\\" (i.e. principles of ecological energetics) are considered formally analogous to the principles of energetics. ===Ecological humanities=== Ecological humanities aims to bridge the divides between the sciences and the humanities, and between Western, Eastern and Indigenous ways of knowing nature. Like ecocentric political theory, the ecological humanities are characterised by a connectivity ontology and a commitment to two fundamental axioms relating to the need to submit to ecological laws and to see humanity as part of a larger living system. ===Ecosystem ecology=== A riparian forest in the White Mountains, New Hampshire (USA) Ecosystem ecology is the integrated study of biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems and their interactions within an ecosystem framework. This science examines how ecosystems work and relates this to their components such as chemicals, bedrock, soil, plants, and animals. Ecosystem ecology examines physical and biological structure and examines how these ecosystem characteristics interact. The relationship between systems ecology and ecosystem ecology is complex. Much of systems ecology can be considered a subset of ecosystem ecology. Ecosystem ecology also utilizes methods that have little to do with the holistic approach of systems ecology. However, systems ecology more actively considers external influences such as economics that usually fall outside the bounds of ecosystem ecology. Whereas ecosystem ecology can be defined as the scientific study of ecosystems, systems ecology is more of a particular approach to the study of ecological systems and phenomena that interact with these systems. ===Industrial ecology=== Industrial ecology is the study of industrial processes as linear (open loop) systems, in which resource and capital investments move through the system to become waste, to a closed loop system where wastes become inputs for new processes. ==See also== * Agroecology * Earth system science * Ecosystem ecology * Ecological literacy * Emergy * Energetics * Energy Systems Language * Holism in science * Holon (philosophy) * Holistic management * Landscape ecology * Antireductionism * Biosemiotics * Ecosemiotics * MuSIASEM ==References== ==Literature== * Gregory Bateson, Steps to an Ecology of Mind, 2000. * Kenneth Edmund Ferguson, Systems Analysis in Ecology, WATT, 1966, 276 pp. * Efraim Halfon, Theoretical Systems Ecology: Advances and Case Studies, 1979. * J.

He grew up in the intellectual atmosphere of an influential dynasty of professors at the Jagiellonian University. His father, Karol J√≥zef Estreicher, was a historian of literature and the chief librarian of the university. His brother, Stanis≈Çaw, was a historian of law and his sister, Maria, was one of the first women in Austria-Hungary to earn a doctorate (in English Philology). Estreicher studied in Berlin, Leipzig, and in London under William Ramsay. As a student at the Jagiellonian University, Estreicher worked as an assistant to Karol Olszewski, the first chemist to liquefy oxygen. After having been appointed assistant in 1899, Estreicher successfully liquefied hydrogen in 1901 before he was promoted to Privatdozent in 1904. In 1900, he described the Jagiellonian globe in the Transactions of the Cracow Academy of Sciences.Tadeusz Estreicher, Globus Biblioteki Jagiello≈Ñskiej z poczƒÖtku wieku XVI, w Krakowie, Nak≈Çadem Akademii Umiƒôjetno≈õci, 1900, 18 pp ; a resum√©, \\"Ein Erdglobus aus dem Anfange des XVI.

From 1906 until 1919 he worked in Switzerland a professor for mineral and general chemistry at the University of Fribourg where he ran a cryogenics laboratory. From 1913 to 1914 he also served as dean of the department. In 1919, aged 47, he returned to newly independent Poland and took a position with the Jagiellonian University where he remained until his retirement. His later work examined the history and language of science. On 6 November 1939, along with his brother Stanis≈Çaw and other professors of the University, Estreicher was caught in Sonderaktion Krakau. Both were transported to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where his brother died on 28 December 1939. Tadeusz survived the camp and was released in February 1940, following protests from European academics to the Nazi German government. ==See also== *List of Poles ==References== ;Notes ;Sources *Banach, A.K., Dybiec, J. & Stopka, K.

Scouting was founded in the Dutch East Indies in 1912, and Indonesia became a member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) in 1953. Its membership is compulsory for students. It has 21,599,748 members (as of 2011), making it the world's largest Scout association. Each year 14 August is celebrated as Pramuka Day to honour the organisation's first public parade in 1961, wherein independence hero Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX of Yogyakarta was appointed as the first Chief Scout of the GPI. With the 2013 education curriculum in effect, it is compulsory for all Indonesian students to join the scout movement as scouting is officially one of the study units in the curriculum. This contributes to the movement's recognition as the world's largest. The name Pramuka was derived from the acronym of \\"Praja muda karana\\", (Sanskrit: young people willing to work). The Pramuka word in Indonesia is currently often used as a term for scouting. ==History== Netherlands Indies stamp from 1937 Scouting came to Indonesia in 1912, as a branch of the Nederlandse Padvinders Organisatie (NPO, Netherlands Pathfinder Organisation). After 1916 it was called the Nederland Indische Padvinders Vereeniging (Netherlands Indies Scout Movement). Other Scouting organizations were established by the Indonesia Scouts in 1916. As the Dutch East Indies, Indonesia had been a branch of the Netherlands Scout Association, yet Scouting was very popular, and had achieved great numbers and standards. Boy Scouts from the Netherlands Indies at the World Scout Jamboree in the Netherlands (1937) When Indonesia became an independent country, there were more than 60 separate Boy Scout and Girl Guide organizations. Most were directly affiliated with some certain political parties or social groups. Attempts were made to unify all Scout organizations into one. The fact that Indonesia is made up of many islands made administration and supervision difficult, and the Japanese occupation caused some twenty separate Scout organizations to spring up, and it took time for them to coalesce. In September 1951 thirteen of the stronger Scout and Guide organizations nationwide met and decided to found a federating body to satisfy national and international needs. With their cooperation, the Ikatan Pandu Indonesia (Ipindo) came into being. Government approval of Ipindo was granted on 22 February 1952, and President Sukarno consented to become patron of the unifying and correlating National Scout Council. With the formation of Ipindo, Indonesia became a full member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in 1953John S. Wilson (1959), Scouting Round the World. First edition, Blandford Press. p. 254 as an organization of its Asia-Pacific Region. In 1955 the Ipindo hosted the country's first Scout Jamboree in Pasar Minggu, South Jakarta. Gerakan Pramuka celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2011 With the beginning of the Guided Democracy period came a period of unification of all Scout and Guide organizations into one. On 9 March 1961, in the State Palace of Jakarta, in the presence of Ipinido representatives and those of other organizations, President Sukarno gave his blessing for the unification of Indonesian Scouting and Guiding into one organization. With the April 1961 decision to merge the Fadjar Harapan Pioneer movement organization (founded in 1959) into Ipindo and other organizations, the establishment of a single Scout Movement organization in Indonesia called \\"Gerakan Pramuka\\" was officially complete. On 20 May 1961, President Sukarno signed a presidential regulation formally declaring Gerakan Pramuka as the official Scout and Guide organization in Indonesia and official heir and successor to the legacies of the former Scout and Guide organizations of the republic. On 30 July, at the Istora Gelora Bung Karno in Jakarta, the GPI was officially launched. Gerakan Pramuka is a former member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, having left WAGGGS and added the girls' program to WOSM also in 2002. After Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX, other Indonesian recipients of the Bronze Wolf, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting, include Abdul Azis Saleh in 1978, John Beng Kiat Liem in 1982 and retired Lieutenant General Mashudi in 1985. In July 2017, the Indonesian government suspended support for Gerakan Pramuka Indonesia after Adhyaksa Dault expressed support for Hizb-ut Tahrir,http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/indonesian-boy-scout-leader- called-for-sharia-law/news-story/889feb92be1eefc9f06412fb6387363a Indonesian Boy Scout leader called for sharia law as Hizb-ut Tahrir is against Indonesia's legislative foundation of Pancasila, an ideology based on a multi- faith democracy.

We have to make big changes. World order must be changed. We must impose sharia.\\" ==Programme== The Indonesia Scout Movement incorporates both boys and girls. It is an educational movement through Scouting activities, the education being directed toward a new, just, peaceful and prosperous Indonesian community based on the national ideology. Activities of the boys and girls are conducted separately from one another. They have joint activities whenever possible and necessary. Management of the Scout Movement is carried out by the National Headquarters. Education for young members is carried out through activities to achieve General Skill Requirements (Syarat Kecakapan Umum/SKU) and Special Skill Requirements (Syarat Kecakapan Khusus/SKK) (merit badge system) towards achieving Garuda Scout. To achieve the goals of Scouting, activities are carried out on the group and national level. Routine activities are focused on the development of character, patriotism, physical fitness, skill and intelligence of the Scouts themselves which are very important for their future life. Activities of the special troops are organized in order to develop specific personal interest and talent and enable them to serve the community with the knowledge, ability and skill he/she have learned. The Scouts take an active part in community development service projects. They take an active part in combating illiteracy. The success of the campaign against illiteracy in one province, gained the Scouts worldwide recognition and won them a UNESCO award. The Scouts also participate in the drive to improve health and nutrition in the community, especially children under five years of age. Acting as extension workers, they practice how to raise cattle, fish, breed hens and grow vegetables. Ensign The Scout emblem incorporates the seed of the coconut palm, a common native Indonesian plant and all parts of which are used in Indonesian everyday life, symbolizing the philosophy of a true Scout, who must make him or herself useful in all aspects of life. The seed form represents the growing spirit, physical toughness, adaptability, and high aspiration of the Scout. The logo is in maroon. ===Age groups=== Gerakan Pramuka is divided in two major educational groups: the member section and the adult section. The first is divided in further age-groups with different educational systems, the second provides the leaders and supports the younger members. The age-groups are: * Cub Scouts (\\"Pramuka Siaga\\") ages 7 to 10, or equal to elementary school's 1st-3rd grade, consists of: ** Siaga Mula ** Siaga Bantu ** Siaga Tata * Scouts (\\"Pramuka Penggalang\\") ‚Äì ages 11 to 15, or equal to elementary school's 4th-6th grade and junior high school's 7th-9th grade, consists of: ** Penggalang Ramu ** Penggalang Rakit ** Penggalang Terap * Rover Scouts (\\"Pramuka Penegak\\") ‚Äì ages 16 to 20, or equal to senior high school's 10th-12th grade, consists of: ** Penegak Bantara ** Penegak Laksana * Venture Scouts (\\"Pramuka Pandega\\") ‚Äì ages 21 to 25, or equal to academy/university students. * Adult members ‚Äì ages 26 and older ===Awards=== Activities are mainly carried out to achieve advancement through the Syarat kecakapan Umum (SKU) or Advancement Badge and Syarat Kecakapan Khusus (TKK) or Merit Badge system. The highest rank in each age group is Pramuka Garuda (Eagle Scout). ===Rover and Venture Scout Special Unit === In Pramuka, there are Rover and Venture Scouts Special Units called Satuan Karya (SAKA). In those units, the Rovers and Ventures are able to learn various skills to be specialist that are useful for their future careers as well as to provide services to the community. There are ten different units: * Law Enforcement Special Unit (Saka Bhayangkara) - in coordination with the Indonesian National Police and the Civil Service Police Units * Air Mindedness Special Unit (Saka Dirgantara) - in coordination with the Indonesian National Armed Forces and the Ministry of Transportation * Sea and Maritime Special Unit (Saka Bahari) - in coordination with the Indonesian National Armed Forces, the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries * Health Care And Services Special Unit (Saka Bakti Husada) - in coordination with the Ministry of Health * Population And Family Planning Special Unit (Saka Kencana/Saka Keluarga Berencana) - in coordination with the Ministry of Health * Plantation And Agriculture Special Unit (Saka Taruna Bumi) - in coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture * Forest Preserver Special Unit (Saka Wana Bakti) - in coordination with the Ministry of Environment and Forestry * Homeland Defense Special Unit (Saka Wira Kartika) - in coordination with the Indonesian National Armed Forces * Tourism Guides Special Unit (Saka Pariwisata) - in coordination with the National Police, Civil Service Police and the Ministry of Tourism * Education and Culture Special Unit (Saka Widya Budaya Bakti) - in coordination with the Ministry of Education and Culture * Environment Special Unit (Saka Kalpataru) - in coordination with the Ministry of Environment and Forestry * Information and Communications Technology Special Unit (Saka Telematika) - in coordination with the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology ===Scout Law (Dasa Dharma)=== Indonesian Scouts at Prambanan (8th National Rover Moot) in 2003 * Believe in God the Almighty * Preserve nature and love each other * Be an affable and knightly patriot * Be obedient and collegial * Help others with compliance and resilience * Be diligent, skilled and cheerful * Be provident and simple * Exercise discipline, be brave and faithful * Be accountable and trustworthy * Have purity in mind, word and act ===Scout Promise (Tri Satya)=== On My Honour, I promise that I will do my best to: * Fulfill my obligation to God and the Republic of Indonesia, and to obey Pancasila * Help other people and get involved in community building * Obey the Scout Law. The insignia of the 34 councils west to east in geographic order, except for the newest North Kalimantan Province, generally correspond to the coat-of-arms of their province ===Councils=== Gerakan Pramuka operates and maintains 34 terriorial councils (kwartir provinsi) each corresponding to provincial borders and a National Council for top-level staff and employees. ===National Special Scout Jamborees=== A National Special Scout Jamboree is held every five years for disabled Scouts. The seventh National Special Scouts Jamboree was held in 2007, in East Jakarta. The first jamboree of this sort to be held in Indonesia was in 1972. ==International units in Indonesia== In addition, there are American Boy Scouts in Jakarta and Balikpapan, linked to the Direct Service branch of the Boy Scouts of America, which supports units around the world. ==See also== *Bung Tomo *Hamengkubuwono IX, former Vice President and founder of the GPI *Paskibraka ==References== ==Further reading== * Scouting 'Round the World, John S.

In other words, causation provides a means of connecting conduct with a resulting effect, typically an injury. In criminal law, it is defined as the actus reus (an action) from which the specific injury or other effect arose and is combined with mens rea (a state of mind) to comprise the elements of guilt. Causation only applies where a result has been achieved and therefore is immaterial with regard to inchoate offenses. ==Background concepts== Legal systems more or less try to uphold the notions of fairness and justice. If a state is going to penalize a person or require that person pay compensation to another for losses incurred, liability is imposed according to the idea that those who injure others should take responsibility for their actions. Although some parts of any legal system will have qualities of strict liability, in which the mens rea is immaterial to the result and subsequent liability of the actor, most look to establish liability by showing that the defendant was the cause of the particular injury or loss. Even the youngest children quickly learn that, with varying degrees of probability, consequences flow from physical acts and omissions. The more predictable the outcome, the greater the likelihood that the actor caused the injury or loss intentionally. There are many ways in which the law might capture this simple rule of practical experience: that there is a natural flow to events, that a reasonable man in the same situation would have foreseen this consequence as likely to occur, that the loss flowed naturally from the breach of contractual duties or tortuous actions, etc. However it is phrased, the essence of the degree of fault attributed will lie in the fact that reasonable people try to avoid injuring others, so if harm was foreseeable, there should be liability to the extent that the extent of the harm actually resulting was foreseeable. ===Relationship between causation and liability=== Causation of an event alone is insufficient to create legal liability. Sometimes causation is one part of a multi-stage test for legal liability. For example, for the defendant to be held liable for the tort of negligence, the defendant must have owed the plaintiff a duty of care, breached that duty, by so doing caused damage to the plaintiff, and that damage must not have been too remote. Causation is just one component of the tort. On other occasions, causation is the only requirement for legal liability (other than the fact that the outcome is proscribed). For example, in the law of product liability, the courts have come to apply to principle of strict liability : the fact that the defendant's product caused the plaintiff harm is the only thing that matters. The defendant need not also have been negligent. On still other occasions, causation is irrelevant to legal liability altogether. For example, under a contract of indemnity insurance, the insurer agrees to indemnify the victim for harm not caused by the insurer, but by other parties. Because of the difficulty in establishing causation, it is one area of the law where the case law overlaps significantly with general doctrines of analytic philosophy to do with causation. The two subjects have long been intermingled. == Establishing causation == Where establishing causation is required to establish legal liability, it usually involves a two-stage inquiry, firstly establishing 'factual' causation, then 'legal' causation. ‚ÄòFactual‚Äô causation must be established before inquiring into legal causation, perhaps by assessing if the defendant acted in the plaintiff‚Äôs loss. Determining ‚Äòlegal‚Äô causation often involves a question of public policy regarding the sort of situation in which, despite the outcome of the factual inquiry, the defendant might nevertheless be released from liability, or impose liability. ==Establishing factual causation== The usual method of establishing factual causation is the but-for test. The but for test inquires ‚ÄòBut for the defendant‚Äôs act, would the harm have occurred?‚Äô A shoots and wounds B. We ask ‚ÄòBut for A's act, would B have been wounded?‚Äô The answer is ‚ÄòNo.‚Äô So we conclude that A caused the harm to B. The but for test is a test of necessity. It asks was it ‚Äònecessary‚Äô for the defendant‚Äôs act to have occurred for the harm to have occurred. In New South Wales, this requirement exists in s 5D of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), General principles. reinforcing established common law principles.. One weakness in the but-for test arises in situations where each of several acts alone are sufficient to cause the harm. For example, if both A and B fire what would alone be fatal shots at C at approximately the same time, and C dies, it becomes impossible to say that but-for A's shot, or but-for B's shot alone, C would have died. Taking the but-for test literally in such a case would seem to make neither A nor B responsible for C's death. The courts have generally accepted the but for test notwithstanding these weaknesses, qualifying it by saying that causation is to be understood ‚Äúas the man in the street‚Äù would,Yorkshire Dale Steamship Co v Minister of War Transport . or by supplementing it with ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù.. This dilemma was handled in the United States in State v. Tally, , where the court ruled that: ‚ÄúThe assistance given ... need not contribute to criminal result in the sense that but for it the result would not have ensued. It is quite sufficient if it facilitated a result that would have transpired without it.‚Äù Using this logic, A and B are liable in that no matter who was responsible for the fatal shot, the other \\"facilitated\\" the criminal act even though his shot was not necessary to deliver the fatal blow. However, legal scholars have attempted to make further inroads into what explains these difficult cases. Some scholars have proposed a test of sufficiency instead of a test of necessity. H. L. A. Hart and Tony Honor√©, and later Richard Wright, have said that something is a cause if it is a ‚Äònecessary element of a set of conditions jointly sufficient for the result‚Äô. This is known as the NESS test. In the case of the two hunters, the set of conditions required to bring about the result of the victim's injury would include a gunshot to the eye, the victim being in the right place at the right time, gravity, etc. In such a set, either of the hunters' shots would be a member, and hence a cause. This arguably gives us a more theoretically satisfying reason to conclude that something was a cause of something else than by appealing to notions of intuition or common sense. Hart and Honore, in their famous work Causation in the Law, also tackle the problem of 'too many causes'. For them, there are degrees of causal contribution. A member of the NESS set is a \\"causally relevant condition\\". This is elevated into a \\"cause\\" where it is a deliberate human intervention, or an abnormal act in the context. So, returning to our hunter example, hunter A's grandmother's birth is a causally relevant condition, but not a \\"cause\\". On the other hand, hunter A's gunshot, being a deliberate human intervention in the ordinary state of affairs, is elevated to the status of \\"cause\\". An intermediate position can be occupied by those who \\"occasion\\" harm, such as accomplices. Imagine an accomplice to a murder who drives the principal to the scene of the crime. Clearly the principal's act in committing the murder is a \\"cause\\" (on the but for or NESS test). So is the accomplice's act in driving the principal to the scene of the crime. However, the causal contribution is not of the same level (and, incidentally, this provides some basis for treating principals and accomplices differently under criminal law). Leon Green and Jane Stapleton are two scholars who take the opposite view. They consider that once something is a \\"but for\\" (Green) or NESS (Stapleton) condition, that ends the factual inquiry altogether, and anything further is a question of policy. ==Establishing legal causation== Notwithstanding the fact that causation may be established in the above situations, the law often intervenes and says that it will nevertheless not hold the defendant liable because in the circumstances the defendant is not to be understood, in a legal sense, as having caused the loss. In the United States, this is known as the doctrine of proximate cause. The most important doctrine is that of novus actus interveniens, which means a ‚Äònew intervening act‚Äô which may ‚Äòcut the chain of causation‚Äô. ===Proximate cause=== The but-for test is factual causation and often gives us the right answer to causal problems, but sometimes not. Two difficulties are immediately obvious. The first is that under the but-for test, almost anything is a cause. But for a tortfeasor's grandmother's birth, the relevant tortious conduct would not have occurred. But for the victim of a crime missing the bus, he or she would not have been at the site of the crime and hence the crime would not have occurred. Yet in these two cases, the grandmother's birth or the victim's missing the bus are not intuitively causes of the resulting harm. This often does not matter in the case where cause is only one element of liability, as the remote actor will most likely not have committed the other elements of the test. The legally liable cause is the one closest to or most proximate to the injury. This is known as the Proximate Cause rule. However, this situation can arise in strict liability situations. ===Intervening cause=== Imagine the following. A critically injures B. As B is wheeled to an ambulance, she is struck by lightning. She would not have been struck if she had not been injured in the first place. Clearly then, A caused B's whole injury on the ‚Äòbut for‚Äô or NESS test. However, at law, the intervention of a supervening event renders the defendant not liable for the injury caused by the lightning. The effect of the principle may be stated simply: :if the new event, whether through human agency or natural causes, does not break the chain, the original actor is liable for all the consequences flowing naturally from the initial circumstances. But if the new act breaks the chain, the liability of the initial actor stops at that point, and the new actor, if human, will be liable for all that flows from his or her contribution. Note, however, that this does not apply if the Eggshell skull rule is used.Nader v Urban Transit Authority of NSW (1985) 2 NSWLR 501.. For details, see article on the Eggshell Skull doctrine.J. Stanley McQuade, The Eggshell Skull Rule and Related Problems in Recovery for Mental Harm in the Law of Torts, 24 Campbell L. Rev. 1, 46 (2001) actus interveniens ===Independent sufficient causes=== When two or more negligent parties, where the consequence of their negligence joins together to cause damages, in a circumstance where either one of them alone would have caused it anyway, each is deemed to be an \\"Independent Sufficient Cause,\\" because each could be deemed a \\"substantial factor,\\" and both are held legally responsible for the damages. For example, where negligent firestarter A's fire joins with negligent firestarter B's fire to burn down House C, both A and B are held responsible. (e.g., Anderson v. Minneapolis, St: P. & S. St. R.R. Co., 146 Minn. 430, 179 N.W. 45 (1920).) This is an element of Legal Cause. ===Summers v. Tice Rule=== The other problem is that of overdetermination. Imagine two hunters, A and B, who each negligently fire a shot that takes out C's eye. Each shot on its own would have been sufficient to cause the damage. But for A's shot, would C's eye have been taken out? Yes. The same answer follows in relation to B's shot. But on the but-for test, this leads us to the counterintuitive position that neither shot caused the injury. However, courts have held that in order to prevent each of the defendants avoiding liability for lack of actual cause, it is necessary to hold both of them responsible, See Summers v. Tice, 33 Cal.2d 80, 199 P.2d 1 (1948). This is known, simply, as the Summers v. Tice Rule. ===Concurrent actual causes=== Suppose that two actors' negligent acts combine to produce one set of damages, where but for either of their negligent acts, no damage would have occurred at all. This is two negligences contributing to a single cause, as distinguished from two separate negligences contributing to two successive or separate causes. These are \\"concurrent actual causes\\". In such cases, courts have held both defendants liable for their negligent acts. Example: A leaves truck parked in the middle of the road at night with its lights off. B fails to notice it in time and plows into it, where it could have been avoided, except for want of negligence, causing damage to both vehicles. Both parties were negligent. (Hill v. Edmonds, 26 A.D.2d 554, 270 N.Y.S.2d 1020 (1966).) ===Foreseeability=== Legal Causation is usually expressed as a question of 'foreseeability'. An actor is liable for the foreseeable, but not the unforeseeable, consequences of his or her act. For example, it is foreseeable that if I shoot someone on a beach and they are immobilized, they may drown in a rising tide rather than from the trauma of the gunshot wound or from loss of blood. However it is not (generally speaking) foreseeable that they will be struck by lightning and killed by that event. This type of causal foreseeability is to be distinguished from foreseeability of extent or kind of injury, which is a question of remoteness of damage, not causation. For example, if I conduct welding work on a dock that lights an oil slick that destroys a ship a long way down the river, it would be hard to construe my negligence as anything other than causal of the ship's damage. There is no novus actus interveniens. However, I may not be held liable if that damage is not of a type foreseeable as arising from my negligence.. That is a question of public policy, and not one of causation. ==Example== An example of how foreseeability does not apply to the extent of an injury is the eggshell skull rule. If Neal punched Matt in the jaw, it is foreseeable that Matt will suffer a bodily injury that he will need to go to the hospital for. However, if his jaw is very weak, and his jaw is dislocated by the punch, then the medical bills, which would have been about $5,000 for wiring his jaw shut had now become $100,000 for a full-blown jaw re-attachment. Neal would still be liable for the entire $100,000, even though $95,000 of those damages were not reasonably foreseeable. == Other relevant considerations == Because causation in the law is a complex amalgam of fact and policy, other doctrines are also important, such as foreseeability and risk. Particularly in the United States, where the doctrine of 'proximate cause' effectively amalgamates the two-stage factual then legal causation inquiry favoured in the English system, one must always be alert to these considerations in assessing the postulated relationship between two events. ===Foreseeability tests=== Some aspects of the physical world are so inevitable that it is always reasonable to impute knowledge of their incidence. So if A abandons B on a beach, A must be taken to foresee that the tide comes in and goes out. But the mere fact that B subsequently drowns is not enough. A court would have to consider where the body was left and what level of injury A believed that B had suffered. If B was left in a position that any reasonable person would consider safe but a storm surge caused extensive flooding throughout the area, this might be a novus actus. That B was further injured by an event within a foreseen class does not of itself require a court to hold that every incident falling within that class is a natural link in the chain. Only those causes that are reasonably foreseeable fit naturally into the chain. So if A had heard a weather forecast predicting a storm, the drowning will be a natural outcome. But if this was an event like a flash flood, an entirely unpredictable event, it will be a novus actus. The question of A's beliefs is no different. If A honestly believes that B is only slightly injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair is it to say that he ought to have foreseen? The test is what the reasonable person would have known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of willful blindness. Fault lies not only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing to understand what the vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and at what the reasonable person would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness. Similarly, in the quantification of damages generally and/or the partitioning of damages between two or more defendants, the extent of the liability to compensate the plaintiff(s) will be determined by what was reasonably foreseeable. So if, for example, the plaintiff unexpectedly contributed to the extent of the loss suffered, that additional element would not be included in the damages award even though the plaintiff would not have had the opportunity to make this mistake had it not been for the defendant's breach. In cases involving the partitioning of damages between multiple defendants, each will be liable to the extent that their contribution foreseeably produced the loss. ===Risk=== Sometimes the reverse situation to a novus actus occurs, i.e. factual causation cannot be proved but the court nevertheless does want to hold the defendant liable. In Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories, the plaintiff's mother consumed diethylstilbestrol as a miscarriage preventive.Sindell, at 594-95. The medicine, later recalled from the market, caused the defendant to develop a malignant bladder tumor due to its negligent manufacture. However, there were many manufacturers of that drug in the market. The manufacturer of the particular medication that caused the injury could not be ascertained for certain.Sindell, at 596. The court held that the defendant was liable in proportion to its market share.Sindell, at 611-12. They departed from traditional notions of pure cause and adopted a ‚Äòrisk based‚Äô approach to liability. The defendant was held liable because of the amount of risk it contributed to the occasioning of the harm. Note that a risk theory is not strictly a theory built on notions of cause at all, as, by definition, the person who caused the injury could not be ascertained for certain. However, it does show that legal notions of causation are a complex mixture of factual causes and ideas of public policy relating to the availability of legal remedies. In R v Miller , the House of Lords said that a person who puts a person in a dangerous position, in that case a fire, will be criminally liable if he does not adequately rectify the situation. ===Evidence proving causation=== To be acceptable, any rule of law must be capable of being applied consistently, thus a definition of the criteria for this qualitative analysis must be supplied. Let us assume a purely factual analysis as a starting point. A injures B and leaves him lying in the road. C is a driver who fails to see B on the road and by running over him, contributes to the cause of his death. It would be possible to ask for a detailed medical evaluation at a post mortem to determine the initial degree of injury and the extent to which B's life was threatened, followed by a second set of injuries from the collision and their contribution. If the first incident merely damaged B's leg so that he could not move, it is tempting to assert that C's driving must have been the more substantial cause and so represents a novus actus breaking the chain. Equally, if B was bleeding to death and the only contribution that the driving made was to break B's arm, the driving is not a novus actus and does not break the chain. But this approach ignores the issue of A's foresight. Roads are, by their nature, used by vehicles and it is clearly foreseeable that a person left lying on the road is at risk of being further injured by an inattentive driver. Hence, if A leaves B on the road with knowledge of that risk and a foreseeable event occurs, A remains the more proximate cause. This leaves whether the test of foresight should be subjective, objective or hybrid (i.e. both subjective and objective). Obviously, there is no difficulty in holding A liable if A had actual knowledge of the likelihood that B would be further injured by a driver. The fault which caused the initial injury is compounded by the omission to move B to a safer place or call for assistance. But let us assume that A never averts the possibility of further injury. The issue is now the extent to which knowledge may be imputed objectively. == The future? == A difficult issue that has arisen recently is the case where the defendant neither factually causes the harm, nor increases the risk of its occurrence. In Chester v Afshar , a doctor negligently failed to warn a patient of risks inherent in an operation, specifically cauda equina syndrome.Chester [5]. The patient had the operation and a risk materialized causing injury. It was found that even if the patient had been warned, the patient would still have undergone the operation, simply at a different time.Chester [7]. The risk of the injury would be the same at both times. Accordingly, the doctor neither caused the injury (because but for the failure to warn, the patient would still have gone ahead with the operation), nor increased the risk of its occurrence (because the risk was the same either way). Yet the House of Lords, embracing a more normative approach to causation, still held the doctor liable. Lawyers and philosophers continue to debate whether and how this changes the state of the law. ==English criminal case law examples== ===Novus actus interveniens=== *Victim's contribution R v Dear (1996) CLR 595. Believing that the victim had sexually interfered with his 12-year-old daughter, the defendant attacked the victim with a Stanley knife. The defendant argued that the chain of causation had been broken because, two days later, the victim had committed suicide either by reopening his wounds or because he had failed to take steps to staunch the blood flow after the wounds had reopened spontaneously (i.e. the potential suicide constituted a novus actus interveniens). It was held that the real question was whether the injuries inflicted by the defendant were an operating and significant cause of or contribution to the death. Distinctions between the victim's mere self-neglect (no break in the chain) and the victim's gross self-neglect (break in the chain) were not helpful. The victim's death resulted from bleeding from the artery severed by the defendant. Whether the resumption or continuation of that bleeding was deliberately caused by the victim, the defendant's conduct remained the operative and significant cause of the victim's death. *Third party's inadvertent contribution R v Smith (1959) 2 QB 35 the defendant stabbed his victim twice in a barrack room brawl. Another soldier carried him to the medical centre but dropped him twice. The medical captain was very busy and failed to recognise the extent of the injuries. If the soldier had received proper treatment, he would have had a good chance of a complete recovery. Smith was convicted of manslaughter because the wound was the \\"operating and substantial cause of death\\". In R v Cheshire (1991) 3 AER 670, the victim was shot in the leg and stomach. In hospital, he suffered pneumonia and respiratory problems in intensive care so had a tracheotomy. After two months, he died. There was some medical negligence because the tracheotomy had caused a thickening of tissue ultimately causing suffocation. In upholding the conviction for murder, Beldam LJ laid down the following test: :Even though negligence in the treatment of the victim was the immediate cause of his death, the jury should not regard it as excluding the responsibility of the accused unless the negligent treatment was so independent of his acts, and in itself so potent in causing death, that they regard the contribution made by his acts as insignificant. *Third party's deliberate intervention R v Malcherek (1981) 73 Cr. App. R. 173. The victim was placed on a life support machine and, after determining that she was brain dead, the doctors turned off the machine. The defendant appealed the conviction of murder arguing that the doctors had broken the chain of causation by deliberately switching off the life support machine. It was held that the original wounds were the operating and substantial cause of death, and that a life support machine does no more than hold the effect of the injuries in suspension and when the machine is switched off, the original wounds continue to cause the death no matter how long the victim survives after the machine's disconnection. In R v Pagett (1983) 76 Cr. App. R. 279, to resist lawful arrest, the defendant held a girl in front of him as a shield and shot at armed policemen. The police instinctively fired back and killed the girl. The Court of Appeal held that the defendant's act caused the death and that the reasonable actions of a third party acting in self-defence could not be regarded as a novus actus interveniens because self-defence is a foreseeable consequence of his action and had not broken the chain of causation. ===Foreseeability=== *Victim's conscious actions R v. Blaue is a criminal law application of the \\"thin skull rule\\" in criminal law. The defendant visited the home of a Jehovah's Witness and demanded sex. When she refused, he stabbed her four times. At hospital, she refused a blood transfusion which would have saved her life. There was no suggestion that the doctors had acted improperly. Blaue was convicted of manslaughter by an unlawful act, namely wounding with intent. \\"But for\\" his actions, she would not have been faced with the choice about treatment and those who use violence on others must take their victims as they find them (albeit that he had known her religion and so her refusal was foreseeable). ==References== ==External links== * Category:Causality Category:Criminal law Category:Elements of crime Category:Judicial remedies Category:Legal concepts Category:Tort law Category:Delict Category:Legal reasoning ","title":"Causation (law)"},{"id":"3253321","text":"Sylwester Andrzej Porowski (born April 7, 1938 in Bierzyn, Lower Silesian Voivodeship), a Polish physicist specializing in solid-state and high pressure physics.

This damages the tissues and causes high blood pressure. Iloprost works by opening (dilating) the blood vessels to allow the blood to flow through again. It was developed by the pharmaceutical company Schering AG and is marketed by Bayer Schering Pharma AG in Europe and Actelion Pharmaceuticals in the USA. ==Clinical pharmacology== Iloprost is a synthetic analogue of prostacyclin PGI2. Iloprost dilates systemic and pulmonary arterial vascular beds. It also affects platelet aggregation but the relevance of this effect to the treatment of pulmonary hypertension is unknown. The two diastereoisomers of iloprost differ in their potency in dilating blood vessels, with the 4S isomer substantially more potent than the 4R isomer. While Iloprost is an analog of PGI2 that activates PGI2's receptor, the Prostacyclin receptor, to stimulate vasodilation, it has little selectivity in that it binds to and activates all four receptors for prostaglandin E2 viz., Prostaglandin EP1 receptor, Prostaglandin EP2 receptor, Prostaglandin EP3 receptor, and Prostaglandin EP4 receptor. Activation of the EP2 and EP4 receptors cause vasodilation but activation of the EP3 receptor causes vasoconstriction. ==Dosage and administration== ===Inhaled iloprost=== In the U.S., iloprost is inhaled specifically using the I-Neb AAD or Prodose AAD delivery systems. In Europe iloprost has been approved for use with two compressed air nebulizers with AAD delivery systems (Halolite and Prodose) as well as with two ultrasonic nebulizers Ventaneb and I-Neb. Ventavis is supplied in 1 mL single-use glass ampules containing either 10 Œºg/mL or 20 Œºg/mL. The 20 Œºg/mL concentration is intended for patients who are maintained at the 5 Œºg dose and who have repeatedly experienced extended treatment times which could result in incomplete dosing. Transitioning patients to the 20 Œºg/mL concentration using the I-neb AAD System will decrease treatment times to help maintain patient compliance.Ventavis Prescribing Information 2009 http://www.pahpathways.com/pdfs/ventavis_prescribing_info.pdf The approved dosing regimen for iloprost is 6 to 9 times daily (no more than every 2 hours) during waking hours, according to individual need and tolerability. The significant clinical effects observed in the pivotal study of patients with PAH were achieved with a median dose of 30 Œºg per day (range: 12.5 to 45 Œºg delivered at the mouthpiece), corresponding to 6 daily inhalations of 5 Œºg. The majority of patients (> 80%) in the pivotal study used this median dose or a higher dose with an excellent treatment compliance after 12 weeks. The first inhaled dose of iloprost should be 2.5 Œºg (as delivered at the mouthpiece). If this dose is well tolerated, dosing should be increased to 5 Œºg and maintained at that dose. Any patient who cannot tolerate the 5 Œºg dose should be maintained at 2.5 Œºg. Each inhalation treatment requires one entire single-use ampule. Each single-use ampule delivers a concentration of 10 Œºg/mL to the medication chamber of either the I-Neb AAD or Prodose AAD System, and delivers a nominal dose of either 2.5 Œºg or 5.0 Œºg to the mouthpiece. After each inhalation session, any solution remaining in the medication chamber should be discarded. Use of the remaining solution, even if the reservoir is \\"topped off\\" with fresh medication, will result in unpredictable dosing. Patients should follow the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning the I-Neb AAD or Prodose AAD System components after each dose administration. Complete information regarding use of iloprost in specific populations (e.g. nursing mothers, pediatrics, patients with hepatic or renal impairment), drug interactions, and overdosage can be found in full prescribing information. ===Intravenous iloprost=== Vial and box of IV iloprost Iloprost is also available in an intravenous form, developed and marketed by Schering AG under the trade name Ilomedine. (in Dutch) IV iloprost is usually administered diluted, via a peripheral vein or central venous catheter. The diluted iloprost should be delivered by an accurate rate delivery system such as a syringe driver. Doses vary with individuals as side effects are better tolerated by some patients than others. The duration of the treatment is typically 3 days. This is usually repeated every 8 to 12 weeks ==Important safety information== Contraindications: * unstable angina; within 6 months of myocardial infarction; decompensated cardiac failure (unless under close medical supervision); severe arrhythmias; congenital or acquired heart-valve defects; within 3 months of cerebrovascular events; pulmonary veno-occlusive disease; conditions which increase risk of bleeding. Common side effects: * In clinical studies, common adverse reactions due to inhaled iloprost included: vasodilation (flushing, 27%), cough (39%), headache (30%), flu syndrome (14%), nausea (13%), neck spasms (12%), hypotension (11%), insomnia (8%), and fainting (syncope) (8%); other serious adverse events reported with the use of Ventavis included congestive heart failure, chest pain, supraventricular tachycardia, dyspnea, swelling of the limbs (especially around the ankles and feet), and kidney failure. Serious adverse events reported with the use of inhaled iloprost include congestive heart failure, chest pain, supraventricular tachycardia, shortness of breath, peripheral edema, and kidney failure. Warnings: * Iloprost as Ventavis is intended for inhalation administration only via the I-Neb AAD or Prodose AAD Systems, pulmonary drug delivery devices. It has not been studied with any other nebulizers. * Vital signs should be monitored while initiating inhaled iloprost therapy. Dose adjustments or a change in therapy should be considered if exertional syncope occurs. Inhaled iloprost should not be initiated in patients with systolic blood pressure lower than 85 mm Hg. Iloprost should be stopped immediately if signs of pulmonary edema occur. This may be a sign of pulmonary venous hypertension. Iloprost has not been evaluated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), severe asthma, or with acute pulmonary infections. * Should signs of pulmonary edema occur when inhaled iloprost is administered in patients with pulmonary hypertension, the treatment should be stopped immediately. This may be a sign of pulmonary venous hypertension. == See also== * Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) * Raynaud's phenomenon * Scleroderma ==References== * Ventavis Package insert prescribing information available in PDF format. * * ATS 2005.

Wilhelm Marceli Nencki (15 January 1847 in Boczki, Zdu≈Ñska Wola County ‚Äì 14 October 1901 in Saint Petersburg) was a famous Polish chemist and doctor. ==Work== Nencki's main scientific interest concentrated on urea synthesis, the chemistry of purines and biological oxidation of aromatic compounds. He was also interested in the structure of proteins, enzymatic processes in the intestine and bacterial biochemistry. One of his achievements was for example demonstration that urea is formed in the organism from amino acids rather than being preformed on a protein molecule and that it is accompanied by binding of carbon dioxide. He proposed that the synthesis of fatty acids proceeds stepwise, by a gradual condensation of two-carbon-atom fragments and that oxidation of fatty acids occurs by splitting into two- carbon units. In 1877 while working at the University of Berne he discovered rhodanine via a reaction between ammonium rhodanide (in modern chemistry ammonium thiocyanate) and chloroacetic acid in water. Among Nencki's greatest achievements was his study on the chemical structure of haemoglobin. He identified haemopyrrole among degradation products of haemoglobin and showed its identity with one of the products obtained by Leon Marchlewski from chlorophyll. He was the first to rigorously analyze the cause of smell in urine following eating asparagus, which he attributed to methanethiol. He made Phenyl salicylate or salol in 1886, and introduced it as a mild intestinal antiseptic (which it is not) .

As its name suggests, the APIC is more advanced than Intel's 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC), particularly enabling the construction of multiprocessor systems. It is one of several architectural designs intended to solve interrupt routing efficiency issues in multiprocessor computer systems. The APIC is a split architecture design, with a local component (LAPIC) usually integrated into the processor itself, and an optional I/O APIC on a system bus. The first APIC was the 82489DX it was a discrete chip that functioned both as local and I/O APIC. The 82489DX enabled construction of symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) systems with the Intel 486 and early Pentium processors; for example, the reference two-way 486 SMP system used three 82489DX chips, two as local APICs and one as I/O APIC. Starting with the P54C processor, the local APIC functionality was integrated into the Intel processors' silicon. The first dedicated I/O APIC was the Intel 82093AA, which was intended for PIIX3-based systems. == Overview == There are two components in the Intel APIC system, the local APIC (LAPIC) and the I/O APIC. There is one LAPIC in each CPU in the system. In the very first implementation (82489DX), the LAPIC was a discrete circuit opposed to its thereafter implementation in Intel processors' silicon. There is typically one I/O APIC for each peripheral bus in the system. In original system designs, LAPICs and I/O APICs were connected by a dedicated APIC bus. Newer systems use the system bus for communication between all APIC components. Each APIC, whether a discrete chip or integrated in a CPU, has a version register containing a four-bit version number for its specific APIC implementation. For example, the 82489DX has an APIC version number of 0, while version 1 was assigned to the first generation of local APICs integrated in the Pentium 90 and 100 processors.Intel MultiProcessor Specification, version 1.4, page 3-5, May 1997 In systems containing an 8259 PIC, the 8259 may be connected to the LAPIC in the system's bootstrap processor (BSP), or to one of the system's I/O APICs, or both. Logically, however, the 8259 is only connected once at any given time. ==Discrete APIC== The first-generation Intel APIC chip, the 82489DX, which was meant to be used with Intel 80486 and early Pentium processors, is actually an external local and I/O APIC in one circuit. The Intel MP 1.4 specification refers to it as \\"discrete APIC\\" in contrast with the \\"integrated APIC\\" found in most of the Pentium processors.Intel MultiProcessor Specification, version 1.4, page 1-4, May 1997 The 82489DX had 16 interrupt lines; it also had a quirk that it could lose some ISA interrupts.http://people.freebsd.org/~fsmp/SMP/papers/apicsubsystem.txt In a multiprocessor 486 system, each CPU had to be paired with its own 82489DX; additionally a supplementary 82489DX had to be used as I/O APIC. The 82489DX could not emulate the 8259A (XT-PIC) so these also had to be included as physical chips for backwards compatibility.Intel MultiProcessor Specification, version 1.4, page 5-3, May 1997 The 82489DX was a packaged as a 132-pin PQFP. ==Integrated local APICs== Local APICs (LAPICs) manage all external interrupts for some specific processor in an SMP system. In addition, they are able to accept and generate inter-processor interrupts (IPIs) between LAPICs. LAPICs may support up to 224 usable interrupt vectors from an I/O APIC. Vector numbers 0 to 31, out of 0 to 255, are reserved for exception handling by x86 processors. All Intel processors starting with the P5 microarchitecture (P54C) have a built-in local APIC. However, if the local APIC is disabled in a P5 processor, it cannot be re-enabled by software; this limitation no longer exists in the P6 processors and later ones. In single-processor systems, the major advantage of the local APIC is that PCI cards no longer need to have their interrupts mapped to ISA interrupts, but can use virtual PCI IRQs above 15, resulting in fewer conflicts and better performance. In the Microsoft family of operating systems, Windows XP was the first to properly make use of virtual IRQs provided by the local APIC, with some partial support present in Windows 2000. In Windows 2000, the spreading of PCI card interrupts to virtual IRQ happens only if the machine also has an I/O APIC. Microsoft blamed their Windows 2000 implementation on information they had received from Intel supposedly promising that all future systems would contain an I/O APIC as well, something that in retrospect did not happen. (A Microsoft document from that era even claimed that \\"without an I/O APIC in the system, the local APICs are useless. In such a situation, Windows 2000 has to revert to using the 8259 PIC.\\") The sudden widespread use of the local APIC with Windows XP did expose a number of bugs in various BIOS implementations. In particular, Microsoft was forced to retain the PCI IRQ stacking behavior for any machine with a CardBus controller (and without an I/O APIC). The Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI) feature of the PCI 2.2 and later specifications cannot be used without the local APIC being enabled. Use of MSI obviates the need for an I/O APIC. Additionally, up to 224 interrupts are supported in MSI mode, and IRQ sharing is not allowed. === APIC timer === Another advantage of the local APIC is that it also provides a high-resolution (on the order of one microsecond or better) timer that can be used in both interval and one-off mode.Uwe Walter, Vincent Oberle Œº-second precision timer support for the Linux kernel The APIC timer had its initial acceptance woes. A Microsoft document from 2002 (which advocated for the adoption of High Precision Event Timer instead) criticized the LAPIC timer for having \\"poor resolution\\" and stating that \\"the clocks silicon is sometimes very buggy\\".Guidelines For Providing Multimedia Timer Support, September 20, 2002 Nevertheless, the APIC timer is used for example by Windows 7 when profiling is enabled, and by Windows 8 in all circumstances. (Before Windows 8 claimed exclusive rights to this timer, it was also used by some programs like CPU-Z.) Under Microsoft Windows the APIC timer is not a shareable resource.Windows 8 and APIC timer The aperiodic interrupts offered by the APIC timer are used by the Linux kernel tickless kernel feature. This optional but default feature is new with 2.6.18. With it enabled on a computer with an APIC timer, the kernel does not use the 8253 Programmable Interval Timer for timekeeping. A VMware document notes that \\"software does not have a reliable way to determine its frequency. Generally, the only way to determine the local APIC timer‚Äôs frequency is to measure it using the PIT or CMOS timer, which yields only an approximate result.\\"Timekeeping in VMware Virtual Machines (for VMware vSphere 5.0, Workstation 8.0, Fusion 4.0), page 8 ==I/O APICs== I/O APICs contain a redirection table, which is used to route the interrupts it receives from peripheral buses to one or more local APICs. The first-generation dedicated I/O APIC, the 82093AA, had support for 24 interrupt lines.James Coleman, Reducing Interrupt Latency Through the Use of Message Signaled Interrupts, pp. 10-11 It was packaged as a 64-Pin PQFP. The 82093AA normally connected to the PIIX3 and used its integrated legacy 8259 PICs. According to a 2009 Intel benchmark using Linux, the I/O APIC reduced interrupt latency by a factor of almost three relative to the 8259 emulation (XT-PIC), while using MSI reduced the latency even more, by a factor of nearly seven relative to the XT-PIC baseline.James Coleman, Reducing Interrupt Latency Through the Use of Message Signaled Interrupts, p. 19 == Variants == The xAPIC was introduced with the Pentium 4, while the x2APIC is the most recent generation of the Intel's programmable interrupt controller, introduced with the Nehalem microarchitecture in November 2008. The major improvements of the x2APIC address the number of supported CPUs and performance of the interface. The x2APIC now uses 32 bits to address CPUs, allowing to address up to 232 ‚àí 1 CPUs using the physical destination mode. The logical destination mode now works differently and introduces clusters; using this mode, one can address up to 220 ‚àí 16 processors. The x2APIC architecture also provides backward compatibility modes to the original Intel APIC Architecture (introduced with the Pentium/P6) and with the xAPIC architecture (introduced with the Pentium 4). The improved interface reduces the number of needed APIC register access for sending Inter-processor interrupts (IPIs). Because of this advantage, KVM can and does emulate the x2APIC for older processors that do not physically support it, and this support is exposed from QEMU going back to Conroe and even for AMD Opteron G-series processors (neither of which natively support x2APIC). APICv is the Intel's brand name for hardware virtualization support aimed at reducing interrupt overhead in guests. APICv was introduced in the Ivy Bridge-EP processor series, which is sold as Xeon E5-26xx v2 (launched in late 2013) and as Xeon E5-46xx v2 (launched in early 2014).http://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/2012/wp- content/uploads/2012/09/2012-lpc-virt-intel-vt-feat- nakajima.pdfhttp://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/product- briefs/xeon-e5-4600-v2-brief.pdf AMD announced a similar technology called AVIC,Wei Huang, Introduction of AMD Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller, XenSummit 2012http://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/2012/wp- content/uploads/2012/09/2012-lpc-virt-interrupt-virt-kvm-roedel.pdf it is available family 15h models 6Xh (Carrizo) processors and newer. == Issues == There are a number of known bugs in implementations of APIC systems, especially with concern to how the 8254 is connected. Defective BIOSes may not set up interrupt routing properly, or provide incorrect ACPI tables and Intel MultiProcessor Specification (MPS) tables. The APIC can also be a cause of system failure when the operating system does not support it properly. On older operating systems, the I/O and local APICs often had to be disabled. While this is not possible anymore due to the prevalence of symmetric multiprocessor and multi-core systems, the bugs in the firmware and the operating systems are now a rare occurrence. == Competition == AMD and Cyrix once proposed a somewhat similar-in-purpose OpenPIC architecture supporting up to 32 processors; it had at least declarative support from IBM and Compaq around 1995. No x86 motherboard was released with OpenPIC however.Andr√© D. Balsa, Note attached to \\"Linux Benchmarking: Part III -- Interpreting Benchmark Results\\" appearing in Issue 24 of Linux Gazette, January 1998 After the OpenPIC's failure in the x86 market, AMD licensed Intel's APIC for its AMD Athlon and later processors.

C. Meigs (AP-116) was a General John Pope class troop transport of the P2-S2-R2 type. She was a fast troop ship that transported troops for the United States in World War II and the Korean War. The ship was named after General Montgomery C. Meigs, the Quartermaster General of the United States Army during the United States Civil War. General M. C. Meigs was launched on 13 March 1944 under a Maritime Commission contract by the Federal Shipbuilding & Drydock Company of Kearny, New Jersey; she was acquired by the Navy on 2 June 1944, and commissioned at Bayonne, New Jersey the next day with Captain George W. McKean, USCG, in command. A fast troop carrier, she was capable of with 5200 troops on board. She was one of several of this class of transports that was manned by United States Coast Guard personnel. ==World War II== After two round-trip, troop-carrying voyages between Newport News, Virginia, and Naples, Italy General Meigs departed for Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where she was visited by Brazilian President Get√∫lio Vargas, and embarked 5,200 troops of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force, the first Brazilian troops to be carried by an American transport. She carried these troops to Italy, where they participated in the Italian campaign. At Naples she embarked troops, civilians, and 460 German prisoners of war for transportation to the United States, collecting additional troops at Bizerte, Tunisia, and at Oran, French Algeria. General Meigs made two similar round-trip voyages from the United States to Italy and North Africa via Brazil, carrying thousands of American and Brazilian troops to Europe for the remaining drive against Nazi Germany, and returning several thousand others to the United States and Brazil. She later deployed troops to Panama and Puerto Rico and to Le Havre, France. From Le Havre, Naples, Marseilles, Karachi, and Nagoya, she made six more trips carrying homebound troops for New York and Brazil. On 4 March 1946, she was decommissioned at San Francisco for transfer to the American President Lines as a passenger ship in the Pacific. She sailed from San Francisco on Jan 24, 1948, arriving in Manila, Philippines on Feb 10. ==Korean War== After the outbreak of hostilities in Korea in 1950, General Meigs was assigned to the Military Sea Transportation Service. Manned by a civilian crew, she made 19 cruises to the Far East carrying thousands of American troops from the West Coast to ports in Japan and South Korea. Following the uncertain armistice on 27 July 1953, she continued to support American readiness in the Far East with troop-rotation cruises in the remainder of 1953 and through 1954. ==Later events== Placed in Reduced Operational Status in 1955, she was transferred to the Maritime Administration on 1 October 1958, and entered the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Olympia, Washington. In 1972 while under tow to the Suisun Bay layup facility, she broke her tow in a storm, and ran aground off the coast of Washington State, where she eventually broke up over the next 4 years, spilling 2.3 million gallons of heavy oil. ==Awards== General M.

The 1927 tour, though no Test matches were played, was a triumph: Merritt took 107 wickets and WisdenWisden, 1928, p. 452. noted that though \\"he showed no great command of length... on certain days - and these were fairly frequent - he had the best of batsmen in trouble\\". Merritt was a certain selection when New Zealand were elevated to Test status with the MCC tour of 1929‚Äì30, but failed to live up to expectations. In the four Tests, he took just eight wickets and, though he bowled more than any other New Zealand player, his bowling was hit for more than 3.6 runs an over, a high scoring rate for those days. Returning to England on the 1931 tour, he took 99 first-class wickets, but failed in the Tests and was dropped for the final Test at Manchester, which was in any case ruined by rain. WisdenWisden, 1932, p. 5. noted that \\"he had his great days but in many matches bowled the bad ball far too often\\". Problems with maintaining a length were compounded by a tendency to over-bowl the googly at the expense of the more effective leg-break. His greatest moment on the tour came against the MCC at Lord's, when he bowled throughout the second innings to take 7 for 28 and dismiss the MCC for 48, giving the New Zealanders an innings victory.R.T. Brittenden, Great Days in New Zealand Cricket, A.H. & A.W. Reed, Wellington, 1958, pp. 74-79. ==Career in England== At the end of the 1931 tour, Merritt stayed in England to play League cricket for the Rishton Cricket Club in Manchester, in breach of his New Zealand Cricket Council agreement not to play in England for at least two years; he took over 1000 League Cricket wickets, also scoring more than 7000 runs. After 2 seasons at Rishton he played for East Lancashire and continued to play in the League after the war. In the winters he played rugby league for Wigan (Heritage No. 369) and Halifax (Heritage No. 412), having been a in the Canterbury team.Bill Merritt at Cricinfo Merritt: \\"My decision to come to England was dictated by business reasons, and when it is realised that some members of the New Zealand team are without employment at all, I do not think I can be blamed\\". He played only three more seasons in New Zealand. In 1935‚Äì36, his last season at home, he coached Canterbury and took 31 wickets in the Plunket Shield, which remained the record for several years.R.T. Brittenden, New Zealand Cricketers, A.H. & A.W. Reed, Wellington, 1961, p. 114. That season, in his last match in New Zealand, he took 13 wickets for 181 against Otago.Canterbury v Otago, 1935-36 By 1938 he had qualified by residence to play for Northamptonshire, where his New Zealand Test colleague Ken James had settled as wicket-keeper. In his one full season for the county, 1939, he scored 926 runs and took 87 wickets, though in this one English season of eight-ball overs he was conceding runs at almost five an over. He was instrumental, with 12 wickets, in enabling Northamptonshire to record their first victory in first-class cricket for almost four years, against Cambridge University, and followed that up with six wickets in an innings when, in the same month of May 1939, the team beat another county (Leicestershire) for the first time since May 1935. Walter Hammond described one of his deliveries as \\"a leg-break which struck like a cobra, one of the nastiest balls I have had to deal with\\". Merritt returned to Northamptonshire to play one season after the Second World War, but his appearances were restricted by a League contract to midweek games. He retired into the Leagues full-time after 1946, returning to New Zealand only in 1966, having run a successful business in Dudley, Worcestershire. He joined the BBC commentary team for the Test Matches when New Zealand toured England in 1958 and 1969.Christopher Martin-Jenkins, Ball by Ball, Grafton, London, 1990, pp. 182, 186. == References Category:1908 births Category:1977 deaths Category:Canterbury cricketers Category:Canterbury rugby league team players Category:Halifax R.L.F.C. players Category:New Zealand cricket commentators Category:New Zealand cricketers Category:New Zealand expatriate rugby league players Category:New Zealand expatriate sportspeople in England Category:New Zealand rugby league players Category:New Zealand Test cricketers Category:Pre-1930 New Zealand representative cricketers Category:Northamptonshire cricketers Category:Wigan Warriors players ","title":"Bill Merritt (cricketer)"},{"id":"3253583","text":" The Zlin Z-50 is an aerobatic sports airplane built by the Czechoslovakian company Zlin Aircraft. ==History== In autumn 1973 it was decided in Moravan Otrokovice to develop a new single seat aerobatic airplane. The design team was headed by Jan Mikula, a noted Czech designer. During the design phase, computer optimization was used to achieve the desired aerodynamic characteristics. The principal goal was to determine the optimum engine and propeller combination for this aircraft. Designers settled on the Lycoming AIO-540 D4B5 horizontally-opposed six-cylinder piston engine, rated at 194 kW (260 hp), driving a three-blade Hoffmann constant speed propeller. The prototype Zl√≠n Z-50L (L for its Lycoming engine), with civil registration OK-070, first flew 18 months after the start of design work, on 18 July 1975.Flight International 9 October 1975, p. 540. The first flights were successful. The Z-50L is a cantilever low-winged single-engined monoplane with a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Unlike the Zl√≠n Z 26 series which it replaced, the Z-50 was of all-metal construction, with limit maneuvering load factors of +9.0 and -6.0. It does not incorporate landing flaps; in their place, two-section ailerons extend the full wingspan, providing an exceptional rate of roll. The designers made ample provision for trimming: automatic trim tabs are used on the inboard aileron sections; on one of the elevators and on the fabric-covered rudder; one outboard aileron has a ground-adjustable trim tab; the elevator has a trim tab which can be adjusted in-flight. The standard fuel capacity can be supplemented by wingtip auxiliary tanks for ferry flights. The full-vision bubble canopy can be jettisoned in-flight if necessary.Mondey, p. 248 The Zl√≠n Z-50 made its competition debut at the 1976 World Aerobatic Championships, being flown by both the Czechoslovak and Polish teams, with a Czechoslovak Z-50 finishing in third place (behind two Soviet- flown Yakovlev Yak-50s), while the Czechoslovak team finished in second place in the team competition.Smith Flight International 21 August 1976, pp. 437‚Äì438. In the 1978 championships, the Zl√≠n was more successful, with Czech- flown Z-50s finishing first and third in the individual competition, and a German-flown Zl√≠n finishing fourth, with the Czechoslovak team winning the team competition.Frazer Flight International 23 September 1978, pp. 1156‚Äì1157. Zl√≠n Z-50s finished fourth in the 1980 championship,Firth Flight International 20 September 1980, p. 1183. and third in the 1982 competition.Flight International 11 September 1982, p. 776. The Zlin Z-50LS, with a more powerful Lycoming AEIO-540 L1B5D engine of 224 kW (300 HP), was first flown by Zdenek Polasek on 29 July 1981. The more powerful engine enhanced vertical maneuvers. The Zlin Z-50LS can fly at 760 kg gross weight in the aerobatic category (+8g to ‚Äì6g). Many Z-50L and LA versions were rebuilt to Z-50LS standard in the early 1980s. A Z-50LS won the World Aerobatic Championships in 1984 and 1986,Postlethwaite Flight International 2 July 1988, p. 34. but the debut of the Sukhoi Su-26 in the 1986 eventually edged out the Zlin from world-class competition.Postlethwaite Flight International 2 July 1988, pp. 34‚Äì35. Zl√≠n Z-50M Another version derived from the Zlin Z-50 aircraft is a \\"baby fifty\\" ‚Äì Z-50M with a LOM M137AZ engine of 134 kW (180 HP). This was introduced as a replacement for the Z-526, which was often converted to N (normal) category and used as a glider tug at aero clubs. The Z-50M has limit maneuvering load factors of +7 and -5,5. Only five Z-50M aircraft were built. In April 1990 a Z-50LS received modified wings and was evaluated to determine if maneuvrability was improved. The plane was designated Z-50LE (Experimental). This unit remained as a prototype and is currently in Moravska Trebova, at the Czech air school. The last version of Zlin 50 is the Z-50LX, which first flew in 1991, piloted by Zlin chief pilot Vladmir Peroutka. This version received additional fuel tanks in the wings and a robust smoke system for airshow routines; it was produced principally at the urging of show pilot Victor Norman. From 1992 to 1995 seven Z-50LX were built, and four of them are used by the Red Bull Flying Bulls Aerobatics Team led by Radka M√°chov√°. Z-50LS are still in use; the Polish Aerobatic Team Zelazny uses 3 of them. ==Variants== ;Z-50L :First production variant with a Lycoming AEIO-540-D4B5 engine, certified in 1977, conversion to 50LA and 50LS variants, 25 built.

Senanayake as first Prime Minister of Ceylon. The Sri Lankan independence movement was a peaceful political movement which was aimed at achieving independence and self-rule for the country of Sri Lanka, then British Ceylon, from the British Empire. The switch of powers was generally known as peaceful transfer of power from the British administration to Ceylon representatives, a phrase that implies considerable continuity with a colonial era that lasted 400 years. It was initiated around the turn of the 20th century and led mostly by the educated middle class. It succeeded when, on 4 February 1948, Ceylon was granted independence as the Dominion of Ceylon. Dominion status within the British Commonwealth was retained for the next 24 years until 22 May 1972 when it became a republic and was renamed the Republic of Sri Lanka. == British colonial rule == The British Raj was dominant in Asia after the Battle of Assaye; following the Battle of Waterloo, the British Empire became more influential. Its prestige was only briefly dented by setbacks in India, Afghanistan and South Africa. It was virtually unchallenged until 1914. The British were very powerful during their rule in Sri Lanka and left more of a lasting impact than any other power. The formation of the Batavian Republic in the Netherlands as an ally and of the French Directory, led to a British attack on Ceylon in 1795 as part of Britain's war against the French Republic. The Kandyan Kingdom collaborated with the British expeditionary forces against the Dutch, as it had with the Dutch against the Portuguese. Once the Dutch had been evicted, their sovereignty ceded by the Treaty of Amiens and subsequent revolts in the low-country suppressed, the British began planning to capture the Kandyan Kingdom. The 1803 and 1804 invasions of the Kandyan provinces in the 1st Kandyan War were bloodily defeated by the Kandyan Sinhalese forces. In 1815, the British fomented a revolt by the Kandyan Sinhalese aristocracy against the last Kandyan monarch and marched into uplands to depose him in the 2nd Kandyan War. The struggle against the colonial power began in 1817 with the Uva Rebellion when the same aristocracy rose against British rule in a rebellion in which their villagers participated. They were defeated by the occupiers. An attempt at rebellion sparked again briefly in 1830. The Kandy and Sinhalese peasantry were stripped of their lands by the Crown Lands (Encroachments) Ordinance No. 12 of 1840 (sometimes called the Crown Lands Ordinance or the Waste Lands Ordinance), a modern enclosure movement and reduced to penury. In 1848 the abortive Matale Rebellion, led by Hennedige Francisco Fernando (Puran Appu) and Gongalegoda Banda was the first transitional step towards abandoning the feudal form of revolt, being fundamentally a peasant revolt. The masses were without the leadership of their native King (deposed in 1815) or their chiefs (either crushed after the Uva Rebellion or collaborating with the colonial power). The leadership passed for the first time in the Kandyan provinces into the hands of ordinary people, non-aristocrats. The leaders were yeomen-artisans, resembling the Levellers in England's Civil War period and mechanics such as Paul Revere and Tom Paine who were at the heart of the American Revolution. However, in the words of Colvin R. de Silva, 'it had leaders but no leadership. The old feudalists were crushed and powerless. No new class capable of leading the struggle and heading it towards power had yet arisen.' === Plantation economy === Agriculture was the main source of revenue for the country and foreign exchanges. The land in Sri Lanka is very important because it has led to many different wars among different countries. In the 1830s, coffee was introduced into Sri Lanka, a crop which flourishes in high altitudes, and grown on the land taken from the peasants. The principal impetus to this development of capitalist production in Sri Lanka was the decline in coffee production in the West Indies, following the abolition of slavery there. However, the dispossessed peasantry was not employed on the plantations: The Kandyan Sinhalese villagers refused to abandon their traditional subsistence holdings and become wage-workers in the harsh conditions that prevailed on these new estates, despite all the pressure exerted by the colonial state. The British therefore had to draw on its reserve army of labour in India, to man its lucrative new outpost to the south. An infamous system of contract labour was established, which transported hundreds of thousands of Tamil 'coolies' from southern India into Sri Lanka for the coffee estates. These Tamil labourers died in tens of thousands on the journey as well as on the plantations. The coffee economy collapsed in the 1870s when coffee blight ravaged the plantations, but the economic system it had created survived intact into the era of its successor, tea, which was introduced on a wide scale from 1880 onwards. Tea was more capital-intensive and needed a higher volume of initial investment to be processed so that individual estate-owners were now supplanted by large English consolidated companies based either in London ('sterling firms') or Colombo ('rupee firms'). Monoculture was thus increasingly capped by monopoly within the plantation economy. The pattern thus created in the 19th century remained in existence down to 1972. The only significant modification to the colonial economy was the addition of a rubber sector in the mid-country areas. == The Buddhist resurgence and the 1915 riot == A new body of urban capitalists was growing in the low country, around transport, shop-keeping, distillery, plantation, and wood-work industries. These entrepreneurs were from many castes and they strongly resented the historically unprecedented and unbuddhistic practice of 'caste discrimination' adopted by the Siam Nikaya in 1764, just 10 years after it had been established by a Thai monk. Around 1800 they organised the Amarapura Nikaya, which became hegemonic in the low-country by the mid-19th century. Buddhism was enforced by kings and priests because they belonged to the Brahmin caste which allowed them to have the power to push what religion they wanted to practice. Buddhism practiced among higher castes (Brahmins) was further enforced by kings/ priest power, and their power increased and carried into the newly settled land. Since the higher caste individuals and those in power were enforcing Buddhism, it eventually became the established religion among the Sihlanese communities. It became very popular among all castes and practiced all over and in different land (areas). There was a practice that was known as Asoka in the Sihlanese kingdom and it is thought that Buddhism has many aspects that stemmed from Asoka. Similar to Asoka (Practice among the Sihlanese) \\"Such establishment of Buddhism in a country was evidently a departure in the history of that religion and seems to have been an innovation of Asoka\\". The British attempt at giving a Protestant Christian education to the young men of the commercial classes backfired, as they transformed the Buddhism practiced in Sri Lanka into something resembling the non-conformist Protestant model. A series of debates against clergymen of the Methodist and the Anglican church was organised, culminating in the defeat of the latter at Panadura by modern logical argument. The Buddhist revival was aided by the Theosophists, led by American Col. Henry Steel Olcott, who helped establish Buddhist schools such as Ananda College, Colombo; Dharmaraja College, Kandy; Maliyadeva College, Kurunegala; Mahinda College, Galle; and Musaeus College, Colombo; at the same time injecting more modern secular western ideas into the 'Protestant' Buddhist thought-stream. === Dharmapala, 1915 and the Ceylon National Congress === Sinhala Buddhist Revivalists such as Anagarika Dharmapala started linking 'Protestant' Buddhism to Sinhalese-ness, creating a Sinhala-Buddhist consciousness, linked to the temperance movement. This cut across the old barriers of caste and was the beginning of a pan- Sinhala Buddhist identity. It appealed in particular to small businessmen and yeomen, who now began to take centre stage against the Mudaliyars, an anglicised class of new elites created by the British rulers. The collaborationist compradore elements of the elite, led by S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, F.R. Senanayake and D.S. Senanayake succeeded the populists led by Dharmapala from the leadership of the temperance movement. A jolt was given to the British aura of invincibility by the German cruiser , which attacked the seaport of Penang in Malaya, sinking a Russian cruiser, bombarded Madras (now Chennai) and sailed unimpeded down the East coast of Sri Lanka. Such was its impact that, in Sri Lanka to this day, 'Emden' is the bogeyman that mothers scare their children with, and the term is still used to refer to a particularly obnoxious person. In a panic, the authorities jailed a Boer wildlife official, H. H. Engelbrecht, after accusing him falsely of having supplied meat to the cruiser. The British rebuff at Gallipoli, fighting Asian Turks, also dented the British white-supremacist sentiment. In 1915 commercial-ethnic rivalry erupted into a riot in the Colombo against the Muslims, with Christians participating as much as Buddhists. The British reacted heavy-handedly, as the riot was also directed against them. Dharmapala had his legs broken and was confined to Jaffna; his brother died there. Captain D. E. Henry Pedris, a militia commander was shot for mutiny. Inspector-General of Police Herbert Dowbiggin became notorious for his methods. Hundreds of Sinhalese Buddhists were arrested by the British colonial government during the Riots of 1915. Those imprisoned without charges included future leaders of the independence movement; F.R. Senanayake, D. S. Senanayake, Anagarika Dharmapala, Dr C A Hewavitarne, Arthur V Dias, H. M. Amarasuriya, Dr. W. A. de Silva, Baron Jayatilaka, Edwin Wijeyeratne, A. E. Goonesinghe, John Silva, Piyadasa Sirisena and others.An illustrious son of Sabaragamuwa. Daily News, retrieved on 20 October 2007. Sir James Peiris initiated and drafted a secret memorandum with the support of Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan and E. W. Perera braved mine and submarine-infested seas (as well as the Police) to carry it in the soles of his shoes to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, pleading for the repeal of martial law and describing the atrocities committed by the Police led by Dowbiggin. The British government ordered the release of the leaders who were in detention. Several high officials were transferred. A new Governor, Sir John Anderson was sent to replace Sir Robert Chalmers with instructions to inquire and report to His Majesty's Government. Newspapers such as The Morning Leader played a vital role to mold public opinion.The History of Newspapers in Ceylon (rootsweb) Retrieved 23 December 2014 In 1919 the Ceylon National Congress (CNC) was founded to agitate for greater autonomy. It did not seek independence, however, representing the comprador elite which opposed Dharmapala. This same elite vigorously opposed the grant of universal suffrage by the Donoughmore Constitutional Commission. Dharmapala was hounded out of the country by a press campaign by the Lake House group of the press baron D. R. Wijewardena. His mantle fell on the next generation, epitomised by the likes of Walisinghe Harischandra, Gunapala Malalasekera, and L.H. Mettananda, who were radicalised by Dharmapala's words. == The Youth Leagues and the struggle for independence == The young people who stepped into the shoes of Dharmapala organised themselves into Youth Leagues, seeking independence and justice for Sri Lanka. The first moves came not from Dharmapala's ethnic group, but from the Tamil youth of Jaffna. In 1924 The Jaffna Students‚Äô Congress, later renamed the Jaffna Youth Congress (JYC) was founded. Influenced by the Indian Independence movement, it was secular and committed to Poorana Swaraj (Complete Self-Rule), national unity, and the eradication of inequalities imposed by caste. In 1927, the JYC invited the Indian independence movement leader Gandhi to visit Jaffna. The JYC led a successful boycott of the first State Council elections in Jaffna in 1931, arguing that the Donoughmore reforms did not concede enough self-government. In the 1930s the Youth Leagues were formed in the South, around a core of intellectuals who had returned from education in Britain, influenced by leftist ideals. The Ministers of the CNC petitioned the colonial government to increase their powers, instead of demanding independence, or even dominion status. They were forced to withdraw their 'Ministers' Memorandum' after a vigorous campaign by the Youth Leagues. The South Colombo Youth League became involved in a strike at the Wellawatte Spinning and weaving mills. It published an irregular journal in Sinhala, Kamkaruwa (The Worker). === Suriya-Mal movement === In protest against the proceeds of poppy sales on Armistice Day (11 November) being used for the benefit of the British ex-servicemen to the detriment of Sri Lankan ex-servicemen, one of the latter, Aelian Perera, had started a rival sale of Suriya (Portia tree) flowers on this day, the proceeds of which were devoted to helping needy Ceylonese ex- servicemen. In 1933 a British teacher Doreen Young Wickremasinghe, wrote an article, The Battle of the Flowers which appeared in the Ceylon Daily News and criticised the practice of forcing Sri Lankan schoolchildren to purchase poppies to help British veterans at the expense of their own, which caused her to be vilified by her compatriots. The South Colombo Youth League now got involved in the Suriya-Mal Movement and revived it on a new anti-imperialist and anti-war basis. Yearly until the Second World War, young men and women sold Suriya flowers on the streets on Armistice Day in competition with the Poppy sellers. The purchasers of the Suriya Mal were generally from the poorer sections of society and the funds collected were not large. But the movement provided a rallying point for the anti-imperialist minded youth of the time. An attempt was made by the British colonial authorities to curb the movement's effectiveness through the 'Street Collection Regulation Ordinance'. Doreen Young was elected the first president of the Suriya Mal movement at a meeting held at the residence of Wilmot Perera in Horana. Terence de Zilva and Robin Ratnam were elected Joint Secretaries, and Roy de Mel Treasurer. === Malaria epidemic and floods === There had been a drought in 1934 which caused a shortage of rice, estimated at 3 million bushels. From October on there were floods, followed by a malaria epidemic in 1934‚Äì35, during which 1,000,000 people were affected and at least 125,000 died. The Suriya-Mal Movement was honed by volunteer work among the poor during the malaria epidemic and the floods. The volunteers found that there was widespread malnutrition, which was aggravated by the shortage of rice, and which reduced resistance to the disease. They helped fight the epidemic by making pills of 'Marmite' yeast extract. Philip Gunawardena and N. M. Perera came to be known as Avissawelle Pilippuwa (Philip from Avissawella) and Parippuwa Mahathaya ('Mr. Dhal') because of the lentils he distributed as dry rations to the people affected in those days. As Sybil described in Forward: The Progressive Weekly many years later: 'Work in connection with malaria relief was an eye-opener to many of these people who were just getting to know the peasant masses. The poverty was incredible, the overcrowding even more so, fifteen, twenty or more people crammed into tiny huts, dying like flies. This was what colonial exploitation meant: worse than the worst that prevailed in Britain when Marx and Engels analysed the conditions of the working classes. This was what had to be fought.' === The Lanka Sama Samaja Party is formed === The Marxist Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP), which grew out of the Youth Leagues in 1935, was the first party to demand independence. The first manifesto of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party declared that its aims were the achievement of complete national independence, the nationalisation of the means of production, distribution, and exchange, and the abolition of inequalities arising from differences of race, caste, creed or gender. Its deputies in the State Council after the 1936 general election, N. M. Perera and Philip Gunawardena and the other leaders Leslie Goonewardene and Colvin R. de Silva were aided in this struggle by not quite so radical members like Don Alwin Rajapaksa of Ruhuna and K. Natesa Iyer of the Indian Tamils. Others who supported them from time to time were George E. de Silva of Kandy, B. H. Aluwihare of Matale, D. P. Jayasuriya of Gampaha, A. Ratnayake of Dumbara and Susantha de Fonseka, Deputy Speaker. They also demanded the replacement of English as the official language by Sinhala and Tamil. In November 1936, motions that 'in the Municipal and Police Courts of the Island the proceedings should be in the vernacular' and that 'entries in police stations should be recorded in the language in which they are originally stated' were passed by the State Council and referred to the Legal Secretary, but nothing was done about these matters and English continued to be the language of the rule until 1956. Fraternal relations were established between the LSSP and the Congress Socialist Party (CSP) of India and an LSSP delegation attended the Faizpur Sessions of the Indian National Congress in 1936. In April 1937 Kamaladevi Chattopadyaya, a leader of the CSP addressed a large number of meetings in various parts of the country on a national tour organised by the LSSP. This helped to establish the indivisibility of the fights for the independence of Sri Lanka and India. In Jaffna, where Kamaladevi also spoke, the left movement found consistent and loyal supporters from among one-time members of the JYC. === Bracegirdle === On 28 November 1936, at a meeting in Colombo, the president of the LSSP, Dr. Inusha de Silva, introduced Mark Anthony Bracegirdle, a British/Australian former planter saying: 'This is the first time a white comrade has ever attended a party meeting held at a street corner.' He made his first public speech in Sri Lanka, warning that the capitalists were trying to split the workers of Sri Lanka and put one against the other. He took an active part in organising a public meeting called by the LSSP on Galle Face Green in Colombo on 10 January 1937 to celebrate Sir Herbert Dowbiggin's departure from the island and to protest against the atrocities during his tenure as Inspector General of Police. In March, he was co-opted to serve on the executive committee. He was employed by Natesa Iyer, Member of the State Council for the Hatton constituency, to 'organise an Estate Labour Federation in Nawalapitiya or Hatton, with an idea that he may be a proper candidate to be the future Secretary of the Labour Federation.' On 3 April, at a meeting at Nawalapitiya attended by two thousand estate workers, at which Kamaladevi Chattopadhyaya spoke, Dr. N. M. Perera said: 'Comrades, I have an announcement to make. You know we have a white comrade (applause) .... He has generously consented to address you. I call upon Comrade Bracegirdle to address you.' Bracegirdle rose to speak amid tumultuous applause and shouts of 'Samy, Samy' (master, master). The authorities were on hand to note his speech: > 'the most noteworthy feature of this meeting ... was the presence of > Bracegirdle and his attack on the planters. He claimed unrivaled knowledge > of the misdeeds of the planters and promised scandalous exposures. His > delivery, facial appearance, his posture were all very threatening ... Every > sentence was punctuated with cries of samy, samy from the labourers. > Labourers were heard to remark that Mr. Bracegirdle has correctly said that > they should not allow planters to break labour laws and they must in future > not take things lying down.' (T. Perera, The Bracegirdle Saga: 60 Years > After, 'What Next', No 5 1997.) The British planters were angry that their prestige was being harmed by a fellow white man. They prevailed upon the British Colonial Governor Sir Reginald Stubbs to deport him. Bracegirdle was served with the order of deportation on 22 April and given 48 hours to leave on the SS Mooltan, on which a passage had been booked for him by the Government. The LSSP with Bracegirdle's assent decided that the order should be defied. Bracegirdle went into hiding and the Colonial Government began an unsuccessful manhunt. LSSP started a campaign to defend him. At that year's May Day rally at Price Park, placards declaring 'We want Bracegirdle ‚Äì Deport Stubbs' were displayed, and a resolution was passed condemning Stubbs, demanding his removal and the withdrawal of the deportation order. On 5 May, in the State Council, NM Perera and Philip Gunawardena moved a vote of censure on the Governor for having ordered the deportation of Bracegirdle without the advice of the acting Home Minister. Even the Board of Ministers had started feeling the heat of public opinion and the vote was passed by 34 votes to 7. On the same day, there was a 50,000-strong rally at Galle Face Green, which was presided over by Colvin R de Silva and addressed by Dr. N.M. Perera, Philip Gunawardena, Leslie Goonewardene, A. E. Goonesinha, George E. de Silva, D. M. Rajapakse, Siripala Samarakkody, Vernon Gunasekera, Handy Perimbanayagam, Mrs. K. Natesa Iyer and S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike. Bracegirdle made a dramatic appearance on the platform at this rally, but the police were powerless to arrest him. However, the police managed to arrest him a couple of days later at the Hulftsdorp residence of Vernon Gunasekera, the Secretary of the LSSP. However, the necessary legal preparations had been made. A writ of habeas corpus was served and the case was called before a bench of three Supreme Court judges presided over by Chief Justice Sir Sidney Abrahams. H. V. Perera, the county's leading civil lawyer, volunteered his services free on behalf of Bracegirdle; he was made a Queen's Counsel (QC) on the day that Bracegirdle appeared in court. On 18 May order was made that he could not be deported for exercising his right to free speech, and Bracegirdle was a free man. == Second World War == After the outbreak of the Second World War, the independence agitators turned to opposition to the Ministers' support for the British war effort. The Ministers brought motions gifting the Sri Lankan taxpayers' money to the British war machine, which were opposed by the pro-independence members of the state council. There was considerable opposition to the war in Sri Lanka, particularly among the workers and the nationalists, many of the latter of whom hoped for a German victory. Among Buddhists, there was disgust that Buddhist monks of German origin were interned as 'enemy aliens' whereas Italian and German Roman Catholic priests were not. Two members of the Governing Party, Junius Richard Jayawardene and Dudley Senanayake, held discussions with the Japanese with a view to collaboration to oust the British. === Estate strike wave === Starting in November 1939 and during the first half of 1940 there was a wave of spontaneous strikes in the British- owned plantations, basically aimed at winning the right of organisation. There were two main plantation unions, Iyer's Ceylon Indian Congress and the All- Ceylon Estate Workers Union (later the Lanka Estate Workers Union, LEWU) led by the Samasamajists. In the Central Province the strike wave reached its zenith in the Mool Oya Estate strike, which was led by Samasamajists including Veluchamy, Secretary of the Estate Workers Union. In this strike, on 19 January 1940, the worker Govindan was shot and killed by the police. As a result of agitation both within the State Council and outside, the Government was compelled to appoint a Commission of Inquiry. Colvin R. de Silva appeared for the widow of Govindan and exposed the combined role of the police and employers in the white plantation raj. After Mool Oya, the strike wave spread southward towards Uva, and the strikes became more prolonged and the workers began more and more to seek the militant leadership of the Sama samajists. In Uva, Samasamajists including Willie Jayatilleke, Edmund Samarakkody and V. Sittampalam were in the leadership. The plantation-raj got the Badulla Magistrate to issue a ban on meetings. N. M. Perera broke the ban and addressed a large meeting in Badulla on 12 May, and the police were powerless to act. At Wewessa Estate the workers set up an elected council and the Superintendent agreed to act in consultation with the Workers' Council. An armed police party that went to restore 'law and order' was disarmed by the workers. The strike wave was finally beaten back by a wave of violence by the police, aided by floods which cut Uva off from the rest of the country for over a week. But the colonial authorities realised that the independence struggle had become too powerful to ignore. === Underground struggle === After Dunkirk, the British colonial authorities reacted in panic (as revealed in secret files released many decades later) and N. M. Perera, Philip Gunawardena and Colvin R. de Silva were arrested on 18 June 1940 and Edmund Samarakkody on 19 June. The LSSP press was raided and sealed. Regulations were promulgated which made open party work practically impossible. However, the experience gained in hiding Bracegirdle now paid off. The cover organisation of the LSSP, of which Doric de Souza and Reggie Senanayake were in charge, had been active for some months. Detention orders had been issued on Leslie Goonewardene but he evaded arrest and went underground. The LSSP was involved in a strike wave which commenced in May 1941 affecting the workers of the Colombo Harbour, Granaries, Wellawatta Mills, Gas Company, Colombo Municipality and the Fort Mt-Lavinia bus route. With Japan's entry into the war, and especially after the fall of Singapore, Sri Lanka became a front-line British base against the Japanese. On 5 April 1942, The Japanese Navy bombed Colombo. That evening, in the confusion following the attack, the LSSP leaders were able to escape, with the help of one of their guards. Several of them fled to India, where they participated in the independence movement there. However, a sizeable contingent remained, led by Robert Gunawardena, Philip's brother. In 1942 and 1944 the LSSP gave leadership to several other strikes and in the process was able to capture the leadership of Government workers‚Äô unions in Colombo. === Cocos Islands mutiny === The fall of Singapore and the subsequent defeat and sinking of the battleship and the battle cruiser , punctured the propaganda of British invincibility. The credibility & prestige of the British was further damaged by the sinking of the aircraft carrier and the cruisers and off Sri Lanka in early April 1942; accompanied at the same time by the virtually unopposed bombing of mainly the British colonial bases in the island and bombardment of Madras (Chennai). Such was the panic amongst the British in Sri Lanka that a large turtle which came ashore was reported by an Australian unit as a number of Japanese amphibious vehicles. The Ceylon Garrison Artillery on Horsburgh Island in the Cocos Islands mutinied on the night of 8/9 May, intending to hand the islands over to the Japanese. The mutiny took place partly because of the agitation by the LSSP. The mutiny was suppressed and three of the mutineers were the only British Commonwealth troops to be executed for mutiny during the Second World War. Gratien Fernando, the leader of the mutiny, was defiant to the end. No Sri Lankan combat regiment was deployed by the British in a combat situation after the Cocos Islands Mutiny. The defenses of Sri Lanka were beefed up to three British army divisions because the island was strategically important, holding almost all the British Empire's resources of rubber. Rationing was instituted so that Sri Lankans were comparatively better fed than their Indian neighbours, in order to prevent disaffection among the natives. === Lanka Regiment and Hikari Kikan === Sinhalese and Tamils in Singapore and Malaysia formed the 'Lanka Regiment' of the Indian National Army, directly under Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. A plan was made to transport them to British occupied Ceylon by submarine, to begin an independence uprising, but this was aborted. The Hikari Kikan, the Japanese liaison office for South Asia, recruited Sinhalese, Tamils, Indians and other south Asians domiciled in Malaya and Singapore for spying missions against the Allies. Four of them were to be landed by submarine at Kirinda, on the south coast of Sri Lanka, to operate a secret radio transmitter to report on South East Asia Command activities. However, they were dropped in error on the Tamil Nadu coast, where they were caught and executed. === Free Lanka Bill === Public opposition to British colonial rule continued to grow. Among the elite there was irritation at the colour-bar practised by the leading clubs. Sir Oliver Ernest Goonetilleke, the Civil Defence Commissioner complained that the British commander of Ceylon, Admiral Sir Geoffrey Layton called him a 'black bastard'. The CNC agreed to accept the Communists, who had been expelled by the Trotskyists in the Sama Samaja Party but who now supported the war effort. At its 25th annual conference, the CNC resolved to demand 'a complete freedom after war'. The leader of the house and Minister of Agriculture and Lands Don Stephen Senanayake left the CNC on the issue of independence, disagreeing with the revised aim of 'the achieving of freedom'. In November 1944, Sir Susantha de Fonseka, the State Council member for Panadura, moved a motion in the State Council calling for a dominion-type constitution for a Free Lanka. Subsequently, the \\"Free Lanka Bill\\" was introduced in the State Council, on 19 January 1945. At annual session of the Ceylon National Congress was held on 27‚Äì28 January 1945 its president, George E. de Silva, said, \\"Today we stand pledged to strive for freedom. Nothing less than that can be accepted.\\" The Congress resolved, \\"Whereas the decision of the State Council 'to frame a Constitution of the Dominion type for a Free Lanka', falls short of the full national right for freedom, nevertheless, this Congress instructs its members in the State Council to support the Bill providing 'a new constitution for a Free Lanka' as an advance in our struggle for freedom...\\" A second reading of the Free Lanka Bill was moved and passed without division on in February. The Bill brought up for a third reading, with amendment, on 22 March. G A Wille, a British-nominated member, moved that ‚ÄòThe Bill be read the third time six months hence‚Äô, which was defeated by 40 to 7. == Post-war unrest == With the conclusion of the war against Germany, public pressure for the release of the detenus increased. On 30 May 1945 A. P. Jayasuriya moved a resolution in the State Council that the detained independence agitators be released unconditionally. This was passed, opposed only by two British nominated members. However, the detainees were only released on 24 June, after a two-day hunger strike. The released prisoners were hailed as heroes and given receptions throughout the country. The Left had emerged stronger than before the war, having earned tremendous prestige. The oppression during the war years had kept unrest under control but, with the relaxation of wartime restrictions, there was an eruption of popular anger. From September onwards, there was a wave of strikes in Colombo, on the tramways and in the harbour. In November the LSSP-led All Ceylon United Motor Workers' Union launched an island-wide bus strike, which was successful in spite of the arrest of N. M. Perera, Philip Gunawardena and other leaders. The All-Ceylon Peasant Congress took action on the compulsory collection of rice by the government at 8 rupees per bushel. In some areas the farmers refused to give their rice to the Government and hundreds were charged in the courts. In 1946 the Congress organised a march on the State Council, which compelled the Ministers to drop the system of compulsory collection. In October 1946 a strike of Government workers, including those in the railway, extended to the harbour, the gas company, and became a general strike. The authorities at first refused to negotiate, but finally the Acting Governor agreed to meet a deputation of the Government Workers‚Äô Trade Union Federation. The adviser to the deputation, N. M. Perera was arrested by the police, but the workers refused to come to a settlement in his absence. In the end Perera was released and a settlement was reached. However, some of the promises made by the Acting Governor were not honoured, and a second general strike broke out in May‚ÄìJune 1947. The Ceylon Defence Force was recalled from leave in order to aid the police in crushing this upsurge. V. Kandasamy of the Government Clerical Service Union was shot dead at Dematagoda, on the way to Kolonnawa after a strike meeting at Hyde Park, Colombo, when the police repeatedly fired on the crowd. The suppression was successful in breaking the strike. However, it was set in stone for the British authorities that their position in the country was untenable. The Bombay Mutiny and other signs of unrest in the armed forces of India had already caused the British to start their retreat from that country. === General Election 1947 === D.S. Senanayake formed the United National Party (UNP) in 1946 , when a new constitution was agreed on. At the elections of 1947, the UNP won a minority of the seats in Parliament, but cobbled together a coalition with the Sinhala Maha Sabha of S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike and the Tamil Congress of G. G. Ponnambalam. It was to this government that the British prepared to hand over power. ==See also== *National Heroes of Sri Lanka *Sri Lankan independence activist *Independence Commemoration Hall (Sri Lanka) ==References== ==Further reading== * Arsecularatne, SN, Sinhalese immigrants in Malaysia & Singapore, 1860-1990: History through recollections, KVG de Silva & Sons, Colombo, 1991 * Brohier, RL, The Golden Age of Military Adventure in Ceylon: an account of the Uva Rebellion 1817-1818.

Thermotunnel cooling avoids this problem by making the gap narrow enough that electrons can tunnel across the gap, carrying the heat with them.

The McNeil emerges from glaciers and alpine lakes in the mountains of the Aleutian Range. The river's destination is the Cook Inlet in Alaska's southwest. The McNeil is the prime habitat of numerous animals, but it is famous for its salmon and brown bears. This wealth of wildlife was one of the reasons for the Alaska State Legislature's decision to designate the McNeil River a wildlife sanctuary in 1967. In 1993, this protected area was enlarged to preserve an area that has the highest concentration of brown bears anywhere in the world. According to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, up to 144 brown bears have been sighted on the river in a single summer with 74 bears congregating in one place at a time Its entire length of 35 miles (55 km) lies within the McNeil River State Game Sanctuary, created in 1967 by the State of Alaska to protect the numerous Alaska brown bears who frequented the area. It also lies entirely within the Kenai Peninsula Borough boundaries. The McNeil River State Game Sanctuary and Refuge is part of a piece of land that is protected from hunting; the rest of this is Katmai National Park. More famous for its bear population than for the size of the river or the strength of its salmon runs, McNeil River has been featured on many television and film documentaries. So well-known has the area become as a bear-viewing area, that in 1973 the State of Alaska began limiting the number of summer visitors to ten per day during peak visitor months of June, July and August. The area has also been \\"wired\\" for webcam remote viewing for those unable to access the river in person. Various groups have been formed to support keeping the area pristine and free from bear-hunting activity. And while the bear population often wanders outside the protected zone their numbers have gradually continued to rise over the years. ==Geography== The McNeil River State Game Sanctuary and Refuge is located on the northeastern Alaskan Peninsula, next to the northeastern part of Katmai National Park and Preserve, about 250 miles (402 km) southwest of the city of Anchorage. The sanctuary and refuge protect about 388 square miles (248,000 acres, 100,362 hectares) of land. Of these, about 200 square miles (128,000 acres, 51,799 hectares), are in the sanctuary and 188 square miles (120,000 acres, 48,562 hectares), are in the refuge. The McNeil River runs through the middle part of the sanctuary north of Mikfik Creek and south of the Paint River drainage. The sanctuary is open to few activities other than wildlife viewing and camping and all hunting and fishing is prohibited there. Within the refuge, both fishing and sport hunting and trapping are allowed, but the hunting of brown bear is banned in both the sanctuary and refuge. The northern edge of the refuge lies about 50 miles (80 km) south of the southern boundary of Lake Clark National Park and Preserve. The refuge is bounded to the west by Katmai National Preserve and the southern and western parts of the sanctuary are bordered by the rest of Katmai National Park. Much of the land is treeless, rolling tundra, but there are several mountainous areas in the southern part of the sanctuary. The nearest road ends 100 miles (161 km) away and access is only by boat or floatplane. Getting there requires extensive planning and booking. ==Fauna== ===Bears=== Mother brown bear with her cubs near the McNeil River McNeil Falls has always been famous for its bear watching, and as early as 1955, when it was closed to hunting, it was featured in an article of National Geographic by Cecil E. Rhode and in the 1956 documentary The Animal World. Bear watching at the falls reached a low in the mid-1970s due to limited rules and human interference, but with better rules, bear numbers increased. As many as 100 bears may be seen at the falls in a single day with frequent sights of 60 or more at one time. Visitors often view bears as they stand at the falls waiting to catch salmon in their mouths. In addition to the main McNeil River, Mikfik Creek to the south and Chenik Lake to the north, in the refuge, also provide bear viewing. Both Mikfik Creek and Chenik Lake offer best bear viewing in June and McNeil River does in July. Visiting McNeil is difficult. To visit the sanctuary and refuge, a person must win a lottery system that allows only 10 people per day for a four-day period to visit McNeil and the bears. This is a very effective way to protect the bears and is the main reason why there are so many bears at McNeil. The McNeil Camp comprises eight ranger cabins and eating areas and a tent camp just beyond. ===Salmon=== Chum salmon are the main salmon species that attract bears to the McNeil River. About 50,000 of them enter the drainage, the majority in July. The salmon feed bears and other carnivores such as foxes and wolves. Bears feed primarily on salmon in July but switch their diet to berries and grass in late August and early September. To reduce the impact of humans on bears, fishing is prohibited. ===Other animals=== Aside from its famous brown bears, the McNeil River Sanctuary also has moose, caribou, wolves, red foxes, wolverines, harbor seals, and bald eagles. None are encountered as frequently as the bears, but patient observers may observe any of them if lucky. ==History== McNeil River has had a long history in protecting its unique resources and the bears. This story began in the 1940s when the site was discovered. People were not only attracted to see the bears, but also to hunt and fish there. Hunters were challenged with hunting the bears because of the unique nature of the area and of how many bears there were. The hunting was regulated over the years, and when Cecil E. Rhode visited in 1954, he asked the Territory of Alaska to close the river to hunting; in one day he counted 32 bears. In 1955, the entire drainage was closed to brown bear hunting. Twelve years later, the area was further protected in a bill signed by Alaska Governor Jay Hammond and became the McNeil River State Game Sanctuary. The sanctuary protected about 93,000 acres and bear numbers visiting the falls grew. However, around 1970 bear numbers began to fall again because of humans getting in bears' space, fishing feet from them, and disturbing them. So new rules were set up in 1973 and bear numbers once again increased. For 20 years, no major events happened and bear numbers at the falls grew to about 60. However, it was discovered in 1993 that a fish ladder would be constructed in the Paint River drainage, just from McNeil Falls. Because it was required to have about 500,000 salmon spawn and die in the Paint River drainage, it was feared that bears would be drawn away from McNeil Falls and be in that drainage during bear hunting season. The Friends of McNeil River filled out a lawsuit that expanded the sanctuary to and established the McNeil River State Game Refuge. The refuge was closed to hunting in 1995. However, the issues did not end. In 2000, the McNeil Refuge was opened to hunting by the Board of Game. It was closed to hunting again in 2005 because of pressure from conservationists, but there was a proposal that would allow bear hunting in 2007. Support by Alaskan governor Sarah Palin pressured the conservationists, but they were finally able to close the refuge to hunting again in March 2007. The bear numbers boomed at McNeil Falls (the record of 74 were counted that year!). ==See also== * List of rivers of Alaska ==References== ==External links== * Friends of McNeil River Category:Rivers of Kenai Peninsula Borough, Alaska Category:Rivers of Alaska ","title":"McNeil River"},{"id":"3253620","text":"Doubleclick is a musician and producer based in the United Kingdom.

His full name is first seen in Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, the first game of the series, when he was using the computer in the V-22 Osprey to encrypt his home call. Fisher was originally voiced by veteran actor Michael Ironside in the first five installments of the series. In 2013, Eric Johnson assumed the voice and physical role in Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist. Ironside later returned to the role in 2018, participating in a crossover downloadable content for Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Wildlands and again in 2020 for Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Breakpoint. He is also added as a playable character in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege, voiced by Jeff Teravaienen. ==Fictional Biography== Countries Fisher has gone to in his missions. Sam Fisher (LCDR, USN-Ret.) is a former employee of Third Echelon, a top-secret black bag operation sub-branch within the National Security Agency (NSA) and a former member of its subsequent \\"Splinter Cell\\" program. Sam is currently the commander/head field operative of Fourth Echelon, a newly created covert special operations/counter-terrorism group that only reports to the President of the United States. ===Early life and education=== Fisher was born on April 17th 1957Concept art of Sam's DD214 from Splinter Cell: Double Agent confirms his date of birth as \\"1957\\". in the affluent Baltimore suburbs of Towson, Maryland. While not much is known of his childhood, it is known that Sam attended a military boarding school after the death of his parents when he was a child until being accepted into the United States Naval Academy, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in Political Science and was commissioned as an ensign in the U.S. Navy. Soon after, his personnel file was flagged for recruitment by the Navy SEALs, which he joined after passing their grueling selection process and training program. In the mid-1980s, while Fisher was attached to the CIA (though still on active duty with the Navy) and working under an official diplomatic cover in Georgia (at the time part of the USSR), he met an NSA crypt-analyst named Regan Burns and they married in 1984 at a small ceremony at Rhein-Main Air Base in Frankfurt, Germany, after learning that Regan was pregnant. On 31 May 1985, Regan gave birth to their only child whom they named Sarah.Newspaper clipping of Sarah Fisher's obituary from Splinter Cell: Double Agent Fisher and Regan divorced after three years of marriage, and after gaining custody of Sarah, Regan reverted to her maiden name and changed Sarah's as well. When Regan died from ovarian cancer sometime in 2000, Fisher gained guardianship of Sarah, moved back to the U.S. and took a job with the CIA, where he worked in weapons development as well as studied experimental weaponry and information warfare, in order to spend more time with her and focus on her upbringing. Third Echelon Conspiracy/D.C. EMP Event While Fisher was on a mission in Iceland, he was informed that Sarah was allegedly killed by a drunk driver in late 2007 or early 2008; however, three years later, he heard a rumor that her death was no accident and went to Malta to investigate. After being captured by Third Echelon in Malta, Grim revealed that Sarah is alive but if Sam wanted to see his daughter again he had to help her investigate Tom Reed. At Third Echelon HQ, Grim played a recording that Lambert made before his death in New York explaining that Sarah's death was faked to prevent her from being used as leverage by a mole inside Third Echelon to compromise Sam and the agency. After learning of this revelation, Sam reluctantly continued to help Grim in stopping Reed from assassinating the President of the United States, all the while reuniting with his daughter and retiring from government work.  Fourth Echelon and the Blacklist attack  Bored with civilian life, Fisher accepts a job from his old associate and best friend, Victor Coste at Paladin Nine Security which specialized at high-tech defense solutions and kidnapping recovery work. But when Coste is injured during the Blacklist attack at Anderson Air Base in Guam, he is then offered by President Patricia Caldwell the position of commander of Fourth Echelon, which consisted of himself, alongside civilian hacker Charlie Cole, former CIA officer Isaac Briggs and lastly his co-worker at Third Echelon, Anna Grimsdottir. ===Relationships=== Sam's direct supervisor and handler in Third Echelon was Irving Lambert (Colonel, USA-Ret.) (deceased, 2008), who maintained constant radio contact with Sam during his missions, providing him with updates and support, and was even one of Fisher's oldest and closest friends. Assisting Lambert were several other Third Echelon employees who provided additional reconnaissance, logistical, and technical support to Sam while operating in the field: Vernon 'Junior' Wilkes (deceased), Anna Gr√≠msd√≥ttir, Frances Coen and William Redding (introduced in Chaos Theory, reassigned sometime after Double Agent). Another of Sam Fisher's oldest friends, Douglas Shetland (Major, USMC-Ret.), a former USMC Recon officer and the CEO of a private military corporation who plays a prominent role in the third game, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, established that Fisher had served with Shetland in Kuwait during the Gulf War (while Shetland's unit was operating alongside the Navy SEALs and became close friends while stationed aboard the USS Nimitz) shortly after Fisher rescues him from a hostage situation during the \\"East Timor\\" mission in the second game, Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow, when Shetland asks, \\"Where are the rest of the SEALs?\\" to which Sam replies and establishing that he left the U.S. Navy Reserve in 1996 by saying \\"I came alone. Haven't been Navy for a decade.\\" When the role of Shetland and his PMC, Displace International, in Chaos Theory becomes clear, Sam hunts him down and kills him on the roof of a bathhouse in Tokyo. Victor 'Vic' Coste is another one of Sam Fisher's oldest and closest friends. The two served together in the Navy SEALs in Iraq during the Persian Gulf War in 1991. During their time in Iraq, Vic and Sam was part of a four- man Navy SEAL team that was ambushed by soldiers of the Iraqi Republican Guard during a routine foot patrol while traversing along the road leading into Baghdad. Two of the four men within the squad were killed in the ambush, Sam (the squad leader at the time) was captured, and Vic Coste was left for dead. Having disobeyed direct orders to hold position and wait for evacuation, Coste single-handedly fought his way through to Sam behind enemy lines and rescued him, despite being heavily outnumbered and outgunned. This is a debt which Sam has never forgotten and as a result, Vic is one of the only people that Sam trusts unconditionally, and often turns to him for covert assistance in the field. ===Professional Profile=== Sam is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall, weighs 77 kg (170 pounds), has greying, brown-black hair and green eyes. He still has an athletic physique for a man in his early 60s. He was the first person to be recruited as a field agent of the \\"Splinter Cell\\" program, Third Echelon's top-secret black ops project. A highly decorated veteran of JSOC's DEVGRU, and the CIA's Special Activities Division, Fisher is a master in the art of stealth, having been trained in various undercover and covert infiltration tactics. He not only specializes in night-time combat but in close-quarters combat in urban warfare and fieldcraft-related skills as well. In addition, Sam is extremely proficient in tradecraft skills such as surveillance tactics, computer hacking, handling explosives and the use of nearly any conventional firearm ambidextrously. He is also a highly trained expert in various forms of martial arts but he far excels in the Israeli self-defense and combat system of Krav Maga. In Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction, he utilized the Center Axis Relock, a modern shooting stance used in close-quarters combat and was invented by Paul Castle. He prefers to work alone in the field. Established from the novels, Sam is known to have command of a startling number of languages, including native English, Spanish, German, Russian, Korean, Chinese, Arabic, Burmese, Georgian, and Persian. While not on assignment or stationed at Fort Meade (while he was working for Third Echelon), Fisher resided in a townhouse in Towson and a farmhouse in rural Germantown, Maryland (according to the novelizations of the series). According to the 2013 graphic novel, Splinter Cell: Echoes (which takes place during the end of Conviction and before the events that happened at the beginning of Splinter Cell: Blacklist), Sam now resides in a two-story house in Falls Church, Virginia, where his daughter, who currently lives in Atlanta, Georgia, stayed with him for a while during the book before moving to New York. Sam's signature sidearm is the FN Five-seveN, which is also his preferred weapon of choice throughout the Splinter Cell franchise. During the \\"Washington Monument\\" level in Conviction, he retrieves the Five-seveN from Victor Coste, who refers to it as Sam's \\"favorite pistol\\". Fisher has conducted operations all over the world: Bolivia, Canada, Cuba, the former East Germany, the Democratic Republic of Congo, mainland China, Iceland, Israel, East Timor, Indonesia, Guam, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Libya, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, North and South Korea, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Paraguay, Myanmar, Serbia (when it was part of Yugoslavia), Georgia, and France. He has also conducted operations inside the United States, in places such as Los Angeles International Airport, Denver International Airport, Sabine Pass, Chicago, Philadelphia, Fort Meade, New York City, New Orleans, Washington, D.C., Ellsworth Federal Penitentiary in Kansas and the CIA's headquarters in Langley, Virginia. The novel version of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell establishes that Sam hated his time in the CIA when he was working there in the mid-late 1980s, and that he mostly had official cover (i.e. he was a \\"diplomatic aide\\"). The \\"Bank\\" mission in Chaos Theory reveals that Fisher served in Panama during Operation Just Cause and was part of a CIA team that raided the same bank during the conflict searching for some of Manuel Noriega's drug money. Around the time the conflict in Panama ended in January 1990, Fisher was called back to active duty with the SEALs and deployed to the Iraqi Republic, where he spent the next several months leading up to the Gulf War \\"sleeping in a ditch on the road between Baghdad and Kuwait\\" prior to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. He was already present once the Western military intervention by the U.S.-led coalition forces began at the beginning of the Gulf War itself in January 1991. ==Personality== As a covert operative whose existence is completely deniable by the U.S. government, Fisher approaches his target objectives in a gruff, no-nonsense manner, but maintains a lighthearted relationship with his colleagues and even with his momentary hostages (even if he is going to kill them). Fisher has little patience for government bureaucracy or behind-the-scenes political maneuvering. A realist who is well aware of the overarching political ramifications behind his assignments and the specific manner authorized for their completion, Fisher maintains a cynical, jaded and sarcastic sense of humor about the covert, illegal, and often morally ambiguous nature of his work. In Pandora Tomorrow, when Lambert informs Fisher that \\"Nobody knows whether he's (Norman Soth) a U.S. intelligence agent or a terrorist,\\" Fisher replies that, \\"Those things aren't mutually exclusive.\\" At the same time, he is highly loyal and a staunch believer in the ideals his work ultimately protects. He is quickly angered by the casual and/or intentional slaughter of innocent civilians or unarmed military personnel by his enemies. In the original Splinter Cell, Fisher is the original trial agent of the nascent Third Echelon initiative and its inaugural Splinter Cell program, and thus his interactions with his handler Colonel Lambert are relatively straightforward but respectful. At the same time, Fisher does drop the occasional sarcastic wisecrack at particularly unusual or obtuse instructions. For instance, during the final level in Pandora Tomorrow, Sam is in an elevator that shuts down when his enemies cut the power. Lambert informs him that the elevator has stopped, and Sam retorts with a sarcastic, \\"Thanks, Lambert.\\" In Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, Fisher is blunt, and he appears fairly disappointed when Lambert orders him to avoid enemy fatalities as part of his mission parameters. Frequently holding captured enemies at knife-point, his dialog with them is creative and highly intimidating, though often morbidly humorous to the audience. In Splinter Cell: Conviction, Fisher's personality takes a leap towards ruthlessness. The intimidating threats of lethal force in Chaos Theory become standard practice. Fisher often tortures his subjects of interrogation through creative use of surrounding objects such pianos, fire extinguishers or windowsills. The tie-in novels expand on Fisher's character. They portray him as detached and preferring solitude, buying non-perishables (such as any CDs he wants) online, and living by himself. The first novel explained in a one-sentence paragraph that Fisher \\"like[s] it that way.\\" He avoids relationships due to the demands of his job, though he eventually engages in a relationship with his Krav Maga instructor Katia in Operation Barracuda but Katia is killed by a sniper shot that was meant for him. However, he does have a close relationship with his daughter, Sarah, which is used to bait him into a trap in the first novel when Sarah is kidnapped in order to get to Fisher. In the novels, Fisher also mentions that he has the ability to fall asleep on command, unlike most people who can only sleep when tired. This, he says, is an asset in his line of work, which often requires him to obtain sleep in the most awkward of places. ==Appearances== ;Games: *Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell (2002) *Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow (2004) *Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory (2005) *Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Essentials (2006) *Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent (2006) *Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction (2010) *Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist (2013) *Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Wildlands (2018) *Far Cry New Dawn (2019) (via easter egg) *Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Breakpoint (2020) *Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege (2020) *Tom Clancy's Elite Squad (2020) ;Novels: * Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell (2004) by David Michaels * Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Operation Barracuda (2005) by David Michaels * Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Checkmate (2006) by David Michaels * Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Fallout (2007) by David Michaels * Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction (2009) by David Michaels * Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Endgame (2009) by David Michaels * Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist Aftermath (2013) by Peter Telep ;Music * Splinter Cell: Conviction: Original Soundtrack (Limited Collector's Edition) (2010) * Agent Sam Fisher - Conviction (2008) * Agent Sam Fisher - Double Agent (2007) ==Reception== In 2008, The Age ranked Fisher as the seventh greatest Xbox character of all time, stating \\"he's a man of action rather than words and a lone wolf, and sometimes, you've just got to respect that.\\" On the other hand, PC Zone staff listed Fisher as the eighth worst character in PC gaming history, declaring \\"Once a great, iconic character - now one in freefall due to a genuine lack of imagination on the part of his creators.\\" Text of this critique targets Splinter Cell: Double Agent. In 2010, Game Informer's readers voted for Fisher as the twelfth top character of the 2000s decade. Although Fisher ultimately did not make the cut, Game Informer staff considered his inclusion in their \\"30 characters that defined a decade\\" collection, with Bryan Vore saying, \\"Before Splinter Cell ... it was easy to assume that Sam Fisher was simply a poor man's Solid Snake.

Jewell was educated at Caulfield Grammar School in Melbourne and played for Under-18s football for Prahran; in Year 12 at Caulfield, he set a then Associated Public Schools of Victoria record for the most runs in a season (later eclipsed in season 2005/06 by Melbourne Grammar School cricket captain Bryan Vance), and captained the school's First XI team. Jewell played one Australian Football League game for the Richmond Football Club in 1997, the club for whom his father Tony Jewell had played for, before turning his attention to cricket. He made his second XI debut for the Victorian Bushrangers in the 2001‚Äì02 season, and made his senior debut shortly afterwards, in a four-run ING Cup loss to the Queensland Bulls. Jewell was seen as a one-day specialist early in his career and opened the batting with a focus on attack. This left him unsettled, and he switched between the second XI and the first XI for the following three seasons. In the 2005‚Äì06 season he changed his approach and adopted a dour, defensive style that has seen him start in all first class games played by Victoria. In January 2006, Jewell scored his maiden first-class century against New South Wales Blues at Lismore. On 21 November 2007, playing for Victoria against Queensland at the Gabba, Jewell made his highest first class score of 188. He and Brad Hodge batted undefeated for the entire third day of the game, only the fourth wicketless day's play in the history of the competition. ==See also== * List of Caulfield Grammar School people ==References== #Ken Piesse (2004).

The precautionary demand for money is the act of holding real balances of money for use in a contingency. As receipts and payments cannot be perfectly foreseen, people hold precautionary balances to minimize the potential loss arising from a contingency. The precautionary demand is dependent on the size of income, the availability of credit, and the rate of interest. With more income the precautionary demand will increase because there are more likely to be surprises in the timing or size of the correspondingly high expenditures. On the other hand, the more readily available is credit (e.g., the larger is the untapped portion of a credit card's line of credit), the less of a need there is to hold precautionary balances of money. A higher rate of interest represents a higher opportunity cost of holding money for any reason, including the precautionary reason, and so leads to lower precautionary holdings.

The Padmini's primary competitors in the Indian market were the Hindustan Ambassador and Standard Herald. This famous carhttp://www.drivespark.com/four-wheelers/2014/a-tribute-to-the-premier- padmini-007886.html ruled the Indian car market and its popularity peaked during 1970s and 80s. Many celebrities of the timehttps://mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com/2015/01/23/history-of-indias- premier-padmini-fiat-car/ including Rajnikanth, Mammootty, Aamir Khan owned a Premier Padmini during its prime years. Known colloquially as the Pad, or Fiat (since the Padmini was originally a Fiat car), the Padmini is named after a 14th-century Rajput princess. Padmini translates to \\"she who sits on the lotus\\" and refers to the Goddess Lakshmi. It was also a common name for girls in India at the time. The Fiat 1100D, based on the Fiat 1200 GranLuce Berlina, debuted in India in 1964 with a carburetted 1,089 cc four-cylinder petrol engine -- rather than the 1,221 cc engine fitted to the GranLuce in Italy. With a 10.8:1 compression ratio, it created at 4,800 rpm with a maximum torque of at 3,000 rpm. The original transmission was a four-speed manual gearbox (without synchronized first gear), which drove the rear wheels via a live rear axle. Its shifter was mounted on the left of the steering column. Weighing , its top speed was . Premier manufactured the Padmini at their Kurla plant in Bombay (now Mumbai) until they sold a majority stake to Fiat SpA in September 1997. The licensed vehicle was initially marketed as the Fiat 1100 Delight. For model year 1973, it was marketed as the Premier President and subsequently as the Premier Padmini. At its peak during the 1970s and 1980s, the car achieved immense popularity among youngsters, celebrities and women. Compared to the Hindustan Ambassador, it looked more modern, was more fuel-efficient and was very easy to drive. ==History== By the early 1980s, engine power was reduced to (at 5,000 rpm) with a modified carburettor to make it more fuel efficient. Premier began to offer an air-conditioner, leather upholstery, courtesy lights and tinted glass. These were considered luxuries in Indian cars at the time. From the mid-1980s, with the advent of more modern, cheaper and more fuel-efficient cars from Maruti Suzuki, the popularity of the Padmini slowly began to wane. The liberalisation of the Indian economy in 1991, which allowed foreign car manufacturers to launch operations in India, began the end for the Padmini. In 1996, Premier tried to revive the car's sagging fortunes with an updated model. Named the Padmini S1, this had a more modern radiator grille, bucket seats, a Nissan floor-shift synchronised gearbox and a more powerful engine thanks to a Solex carburetor and use of a thermostat- controlled electric fan with an output of . A diesel variant, the 137D, was also introduced, with the hope of taking advantage of the rising popularity of diesel vehicles in India. Its engine was built under license from Fratelli Negri Macchine Diesel Sud (FNM), Italy, with a displacement of 1,366 cc and generating . Its top speed was close to 140 km/h, and its fuel efficiency was 24 km/l. Production was shut down because of PAL's management problems. While all cars built by Premier were four-door sedans, small companies such as Starline also offered other bodywork, mainly in the form of estates. ==More recently== In 2014 numerous examples served as taxicabs in Mumbai, though these were being phased out due to regulations enacted in 2013 by the government disallowing vehicles over 20 years old.

At long it is one of the shortest highways in Australia. The highway was opened on 19 March 1932 and was named in honour of Dr John Bradfield. As a government-appointed civil engineer, Bradfield oversaw the tendering process for the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and as the NSW Public Works Department chief engineer had oversight of the bridge design and construction. Amid some controversy, Bradfield was also considered to be the co-designer of the bridge's arch design, along with Dorman Long and Sir Ralph Freeman. ==Route== The southern terminus of the Bradfield Highway is at the northeastern end of the Western Distributor in the Sydney central business district and crosses the Sydney Harbour Bridge, with its northern terminus at the Warringah Freeway in North Sydney, north of the Pacific Highway exit at the Mount Street ramp. Prior to the construction of the Warringah Freeway in 1968, all traffic at the northern terminus of the Bradfield Highway was directed to or from the Pacific Highway, via North Sydney. The Bradfield Highway currently carries six lanes of traffic across the eight lane Sydney Harbour Bridge. The other two traffic lanes on the Sydney Harbour Bridge are used for the Cahill Expressway, which run only southbound on the bridge. During peak periods three out of the six lanes are reversed, giving a 2 √ó 4, 3 √ó 3 or 5 √ó 1 flow. The default is 4 √ó 2, being four north lanes and two south lanes (with the additional two lanes of the Cahill Expressway providing an even flow of traffic). The direction of the lanes is indicated by electronic signage above each lane. The lanes are numbered one to six from west to east. Lane six was also reversed prior to 1990 during the evening rush hour, giving a 6 √ó 0 flow, however this no longer occurs because of changes made to the Warringah Freeway to accommodate the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. In 2001, 159,587 vehicles a day used the highway. In August 1992 the Sydney Harbour Tunnel opened which helped to relieve congestion on the Bradfield Highway. The Bradfield Highway is a designated stock route. ===Road toll=== A road toll is levied on all vehicles travelling across the Sydney Harbour Bridge, via the Bradfield Highway or the Cahill Expressway in a southerly direction only. A toll also applies for vehicles travelling in the same direction using the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. In November 2014 NSW Roads & Maritime Services proposed an to upgrade the tolling infrastructure which included the construction new tolling gantries at four locations on the northern approaches to the bridge, covering the Bradfield Highway, Cahill Expressway and the Sydney Harbour Tunnel, and the removal of existing tolling gantries at both the northern and southern bridge termini. ==Exits and interchanges== ==See also== == References Category:Highways in Sydney Category:Toll roads in Australia ","title":"Bradfield Highway (Sydney)"},{"id":"3253699","text":"Otto Addo (born 9 June 1975 in Hamburg, West Germany) is a scout and manager, and a retired Ghanaian-German footballer who played for Ghana internationally. He is currently the assistant manager of Borussia Dortmund. ==Club career== Addo started his career in 1991 in Hamburg, but failed to make an impression there. He then moved to Hannover 96 in the Regionalliga Nord (third German league). He made a big impression in a squad that featured stars-to-be Gerald Asamoah and Fabian Ernst. That team ripped through the season scoring more than 100 goals, but succumbed to Energie Cottbus in the 1997 promotion playoffs. In 1998, Hannover finally promoted to the Second Bundesliga. In his first season, he scored seven goals in 30 games and was acknowledged as one of the elite players of the league. He then transferred to Borussia Dortmund in 1999 and played more than 75 times for the team, becoming German champion in 2002. However, he was also hampered by great injury troubles, as he tore his cruciate ligaments three times in this time, the first coming after a German Cup match against SC Freiburg on 15 July 2001. The player had an MRI scan which showed he had torn knee ligaments and underwent surgery on his right knee on 22 July at the Vail, Colorado clinic of world-renowned knee specialist surgeon Dr. Richard Steadman. He healed completely after that, and came back to play the 2002 UEFA Cup Final for Dortmund against Feyenoord Rotterdam on 8 May 2002, which Dortmund lost 3‚Äì2 at the Feijenoord Stadion in Rotterdam. On 7 September 2002, Addo tore right knee ligaments for the second time, in a 2004 African Cup of Nations qualifier versus Uganda in Kampala. On 24 September 2003, Addo's career was under threat after he re-injured his troublesome right knee for the third time in Dortmund's 2‚Äì1 UEFA Cup victory over Austria Vienna. He started the match, but was replaced after just 38 minutes. After sitting out the whole of 2004, Addo returned to action as a substitute in Dortmund's 1‚Äì1 league home draw with Borussia M√∂nchengladbach in the last weekend of January 2005. At the beginning of the 2005‚Äì06 season he transferred to FSV Mainz 05, for whom he did not make an initial impact. However, he played well enough to earn a nomination for the Ghanaian squad who appeared at the 2006 World Cup. On 9 August 2007, Addo signed a three-year contract with hometown Hamburger SV, initially alternating with the reserves and the first team. While at Hamburg, Addo revealed his Hamburger goals in an interview with HSVLIVE, also addressing other topics. ==International career== Although born in Germany, Addo played for Ghana for seven years commencing 1999, his debut being a 5‚Äì0 rout of Eritrea on 28 February 1999, and he achieved international prominence when he led the nation in the 2000 African Cup of Nations. Along with Hans Sarpei from VfL Wolfsburg, he is one of two Ghanaians with German roots to have played for the African side. He started for Ghana as right midfielder in the 2006 FIFA World Cup game against the Czech Republic on 17 June 2006 at the RheinEnergieStadion in Cologne, which Ghana won 2‚Äì0. In 2006 he played in Ghana's 2‚Äì1 win over the United States at the Frankenstadion in Nuremberg. ==Coaching career== In December 2013, Addo was appointed as the head scout of the Ghana national football team and prior to the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, succeeding Ibrahim Tanko following the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations and 2013 Africa Cup of Nations. In April 2019, it was announced that Addo would work for former club Borussia Dortmund as a 'talent coach', having previously held a similar role at Borussia M√∂nchengladbach since 2017. ==Playing style== Addo was strong in one-on-one situations, physical, creative, and versatile enough to play on both wings, on the inside and also in the central position, although his main skill was his ability to dribble the ball. ==Honours== ===Club=== Borussia Dortmund * Bundesliga: 2001‚Äì02 * UEFA Cup: Runner-up 2001‚Äì02 ==References== Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:2000 African Cup of Nations players Category:2006 FIFA World Cup players Category:1.

The Tuesday night performances at The Stud ended on 12 August 2008, with Trannyshack resuming as a monthly event at DNA Lounge in March 2010. == Trannyshack history == The Trannyshack stage has hosted celebrities including Lady Gaga, Gwen Stefani, RuPaul, Charo, Michelle Visage, Mary Wilson and many of the contestants from RuPaul's Drag Race among others. In the early years of the club, Ana Matronic of the Scissor Sisters lived in San Francisco and performed frequently at Trannyshack before moving to New York in 1999. Trannyshack ended as a weekly Tuesday night show on August 12, 2008 with \\"The Final Tuesday\\". Heklina claims she stopped presenting the show because its success caused it to be copied by other shows: \\"I felt like if everyone's trying to copy me, maybe I should try to do something different.\\" The Trannyshack name has become so popular that Heklina has filed six cease- and-desist letters against other clubs using the name. In January 2015, Trannyshack was renamed \\"Mother\\" and now takes place at Oasis, a San Francisco gay club owned by Heklina. The reason for the name change was out of respect for the transgender community, who were critical of the use of the word \\"tranny\\" as being offensive. \\"Mother\\" ended in February 2020. ==Miss Trannyshack Pageant == The Miss Trannyshack Pageant is no longer held in a nightclub. In 2004, Trannyshack Founder and Promoter Heklina teamed up with event producer Juan Garcia of Beatbox Events to move the event from the clubs to the Regency Ballroom. Together with Juan Garcia the help of drag phenomena and co-hostess Juanita More!, they have expanded the contest into a late-night dance party complete with celebrity judges, live performances, concert-like production, and special effects. Until 2007, which marked the final Miss Trannyshack Pageant, this annual offsite event had been a pageant-style competition for the title \\"Miss Trannyshack.\\" Candidates for the pageant were recruited from Trannyshack, a weekly show at the Stud Bar in San Francisco. Every week, a new theme was presented. Guests could expect a mix of everything from lowbrow trash, \\"old-school\\" traditional drag performances, avant-garde and highbrow installations, and punk-rock shows in a dance-club setting. Trannyshack guest favorites worked towards entering and winning the coveted title \\"Miss Trannyshack\\" at the annual Trannyshack pageant. == Special Trannyshack events == Trannyshack also holds the annual Trannyshack Reno bus trip. Hosted by Trannyshack veteran Peaches Christ and held over Easter Weekend, participants are encouraged to dress and act as outrageously and provocatively as possible. Heavy drinking is also encouraged. During the ride from San Francisco to Reno, the tour bus makes several pit stops in relatively conservative places such as Placerville and Donner Pass. The culmination of the event is a special Trannyshack show at a Reno nightclub, followed by Easter Sunday brunch the next day at a local casino. Trannyshack also holds the annual SS Trannyshack chartered boat cruise on San Francisco Bay, usually held in September, although the event has not been held since 2004; however, it has been announced that the event will be revived for the 2009 Folsom Street Fair. == References == == External links == * Official Trannyshack website * A night at the Trannyshack * A Gallery of Trannyshack Posters * Trannyshack Archival Footage On Youtube* * Category:LGBT culture in San Francisco Category:Drag events Category:LGBT nightclubs in California ","title":"Trannyshack"},{"id":"3253741","text":"Georges d'Armagnac and his secretary Guillaume Philandrier by Titian (Louvre Museum) Georges d'Armagnac (c. 1501 - JulyVarious dates are given in fact 1585) was a French humanist, patron of arts, Cardinal and diplomat deeply embroiled in the Italian Wars and in the French Wars of Religion. ==Biography== He was born at Avignon, the son of Pierre d'Armagnac, sire de Caussade and Yolande of Beaumont, and thus he was a grandson of Catherine de Foix, and so a highly connected member of the powerful house of Foix d'Armagnac. In his youth he was the prot√©g√© of his kinsman Cardinal Georges d'Amboise. His uncle Charles, duc d'Alen√ßon introduced him to Francis I. Though there is no record of his ecclesiastical training or his sacred orders, he was approved by the king's sister, Marguerite (future Queen of Navarre), and swiftly provided with sinecures: dean of the cathedral chapter of Meaux, honorary abbot (in commendatario) of Saint-Ambroise de Bourges, and nearer to home, a canon of the cathedral chapter of Rodez. In 1529 he was appointed bishop of Rodez, and he was soon joined by his secretary and life companion, the humanist Guillaume Philandrier, who provided, under Armagnac's patronage, the design for the new cathedral fa√ßade at Rodez and catalogued the Bishop's increasing library. He was ambassador to Venice from 1536 to 1539; here he took the opportunity to sit to Titian for a highly personal and evocative double portraitNow in the collection of the Duke of Northumberland, Alnwick with the attentive Philandrier, whose commentary on Vituvius, the first in French, was completed in 1544. Armgnac's brief was to secure Venetian neutrality in the north Italian military conflicts between Francis I and Charles V, an episode of the Italian Wars. The emperor's failure to take Avignon led him to retreat from the south of France (1538). With the temporary truce of 1539 the king sent him as ambassador to the Holy See, where he was made a Cardinal in December 1544, remaining as ever the agent of French policy. He participated in the conclave (November 1550) that elected his friend, the worldly humanist and patron Pope Julius III. Armagnac's library was constantly growing. In 1543 he commissioned an illuminated book of meditations in the best Italian humanistic hand from Franc. WydonNow in the Mus√©e de Cond√©, Chantilly and was pleased enough with it to commission a pontifical from Wydon in 1557.Now in B.N. Wherever he was, the Cardinal sought out the company of men of learning and experience, and often befriended them. When his former tutor and countryman from Albi, the adventurous philologist and investigator of the antiquities of Constantinople Pierre Gilles, died penniless in Rome in 1555, Cardinal d'Aramagnac arranged from Toulouse to pay the funeral expenses and erect a wall tomb . Gilles' posthumous Antiquities of Constantinople were dedicated to the Cardinal. In 1552 he was appointed lieutenant-general of the king at Toulouse, together with the bishop of Cahors. On 6 January 1554, in the chapel of the ch√¢teau of Pau, he baptized Henry of Navarre, future king of France. In 1560 he was raised to the Archbishopric of Toulouse, the cultural capital of the Languedoc, the occasion for another visit to Rome. In 1565, Pope Pius IV appointed him vice-legate at Avignon, together with the Cardinal de Bourbon. The papal city of Avignon remained faithful in the bloody Wars of Religion that had broken out in earnest in 1562, but in the surrounding Venaissin the Huguenots were solidly implanted in Orange and the neighboring Dauphin√©, and fierce fighting ensued. Charles IX appointed his cousin Charles of Burgundy legate, but the man on the site was Armagnac, solidly of the Catholic party. In this position the Cardinal d'Armagnac vigorously defended Catholic interests against the Huguenots; when his cousin Jeanne d'Albret, queen of Navarre and mother of the future Henry IV, declared for the reformed church, he sent her a stiff letter of reproof, which, with her skillful and courageous reply conjoined, was printed and circulated throughout the south. The pope showed his approval of d'Armagnac's administration by promoting him to the Archbishopric of Avignon (1576). Georges d'Armagnac's position among the first nobility of Languedoc, his intelligence and judgment of men and events, and the protection which he granted to the arts and sciences placed him in the first rank of the faithful servants of the 16th-century Church. He was a friend and correspondent of the leading literary figures of his time in France and Italy. ==References== ==Sources== * ==External links== *Catholic Encyclopedia 1908: \\"Georges d'Armagnac\\" *Illuminated manuscripts prepared for Georges d'Amboise *Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church *Lemerle, Fr√©d√©rique, 2003.

While the game has multiple variations, the predominant version through much of its history was played with a full fifteen-ball , of which the winning player was required to legally pocket eight balls. A shortened version of the game using nine balls of which the players must legally pocket five for the win, often called \\"nine-ball banks,\\" gained popularity in the 1990s and 2000s and is the subject of international professional competition and televised matches. ==Rules== ===Aim=== The object of the game is to be the first player to five balls in any order (or eight balls, when played with a full rack). ===Rack=== The balls are racked in nine-ball formation (or eight- ball formation if using a full rack), but in no particular order. On the break shot, at least four balls must hit the rails else it is an illegal break. Any balls pocketed during the break do not count toward the score and will be spotted after the player's inning ends. Pocketing a ball on the break results in the player continuing to shoot. On an illegal break, the opponent has the option of requesting a re-rack or accepting the table as-is and may begin shooting. ===Play=== The key rule is that all shots must be banked ( to , then object ball to one or more on the way to the ). Bank pool is one of the \\"cleanest\\" (no \\"\\") pool games -- no (the object ball must be hit directly with the cueball, without hitting the rail first); no (shots must be cue ball to the object ball, then object ball to the called pocket, and the shooter must call both the ball and pocket); and the object ball cannot hit another ball on the way to the pocket (no ). ===Fouls=== The shooter \\"owes\\" the table a ball if they foul -- a previously pocketed ball (if any) must be . Any ball pocketed on a is spotted in addition to the ball owed. If the cue ball is (pocketed or knocked off the table), it is a foul, and the cue ball must be behind the (i.e., in the \\"\\"). Any balls that were sunk on that shot are spotted. If the shooter has not already legally pocketed a ball at the time of the foul, a ball is still owed, which must be spotted after the in which it was legally pocketed. If the shooter makes a legal bank shot and another ball goes in accidentally, it is not a foul, but that extra ball is spotted after the inning. It is also a foul if the shooter does not hit the ' object ball and drive it or the cue ball to a cushion or pocket the object ball (this is different from nine-ball and standardized eight-ball, in which any ball may contact a rail after the object-ball hit to avoid fouling). In many areas, fouling three times during successive turns means a loss of , but that rule may often be ignored in local amateur play. A stricter variant preferred by some is that even three non-consecutive fouls is a loss of game. Players typically make sure the rules are clear and agreed-upon before play begins, especially when gambling. == References == ==External links== *Official rules of bank pool of the Billiard Congress of America *Simplified bank pool rules, at BilliardsForum - non-authoritative Category:Pool (cue sports) ","title":"Bank pool"},{"id":"3253831","text":"More Greatest Hits of the Monkees is a 1982 greatest hits compilation album of songs by the Monkees, assembled and released by Arista Records.

Odum defined transformity as, > \\"the emergy of one type required to make a unit of energy of another type. > For example, since 3 coal emjoules (cej) of coal and 1 cej of services are > required to generate 1 J of electricity, the coal transformity of > electricity is 4 cej/J\\" The concept of transformity was first introduced by David M. Scienceman in collaboration with Howard T. Odum. In 1987 Scienceman proposed that the phrases, \\"energy quality\\", \\"energy quality factor\\", and \\"energy transformation ratio\\", all used by H.T.Odum, be replaced by the word \\"transformity\\" (p. 261). This approach aims to solve a long standing issue about the relation of qualitative phenomena to quantitative phenomena often analysed in the physical sciences, which in turn is a synthesis of rationalism with phenomenology. That is to say that it aims to quantify quality. ==Transformity: the rationalization of quality == === Definition of transformity in words === Scienceman then defined transformity as, > \\"a quantitative variable describing the measurable property of a form of > energy, its ability to amplify as feedback, relative to the source energy > consumed in its formation, under maximum power conditions. As a quantitative > variable analogous to thermodynamic temperature, transformity requires > specification of units.\\" (1987, p. 261. My emphasis). In 1996 H.T.Odum defined transformity as, > \\"the emergy of one type required to make a unit of energy of another type. > For example, since 3 coal emjoules (cej) of coal and 1 cej of services are > required to generate 1 J of electricity, the coal transformity of > electricity is 4 cej/J\\" G.P.Genoni expanded on this definition and maintained that, \\"the energy input of one kind required to sustain one unit of energy of another kind, is used to quantify hierarchical position\\" (1997, p. 97). According to Scienceman, the concept of transformity introduces a new basic dimension into physics (1987, p. 261). However there is ambiguity in the dimensional analysis of transformity as Bastianoni et al. (2007) state that transformity is a dimensionless ratio. === Definition as a ratio === One part of the rationalist viewpoint associated with modernity and science is to contrast qualitatively different phenomena under transformation through quantitative ratios, with the aim of uncovering any constancy amidst the transformation change. Like the efficiency ratio, transformity is quantitatively defined by a simple input- output ratio. However the transformity ratio is the inverse of efficiency and involves both indirect and direct energy flows rather than simply direct input-output energy ratio of energy efficiency. This is to say that it is defined as the ratio of emergy input to energy output. Original version:: \\\\mbox{Transformity} = \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{emergy input}}{\\\\mbox{energy output}} === Development === However, it was realised that the term \\"energy output\\" refers to both the useful energy output and the non-useful energy output. (Note: that as given by P.K.Nag, an alternative name for 'useful energy' is 'availability' or exergy, and an alternative name for 'non-useful energy' is 'unavailability', or anergy (Nag 1984, p. 156)). But as E.Sciubba and S.Ulgiati observed, the notion of transformity meant to capture the emergy invested per unit product, or useful output. The concept of Transformity was therefore further specified as the ratio of \\"input emergy dissipated (availability used up)\\" to the \\"unit output exergy\\" (Sciubba and Ulgiati 2005, p. 1957). For J√∏rgensen (2000, p. 61) transformity is a strong indicator of the efficiency of the system. Revised version: \\\\mbox{Transformity} = \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{emergy input}}{\\\\mbox{exergy output}} or Tr = \\\\frac{E_m}{E_x} (after Giannantoni 2002, p. 8). Substituting in the mathematical definition of emergy given in that article. : Tr = \\\\frac {\\\\int_{t=-\\\\infty}^{t_0} P_x \\\\, dt}{E_x} ==Contemporary development== ===Two transformities=== Albertina Lourenci and Jo√£o Antonio Zuffo from the Department of Electronic Systems Engineering at S√£o Paulo have posited that there are two transformity values; Tr_{ex} and Tr_{theta} (Lourenci and Zuffo 2004, p. 411). * Tr_{ex}: compensates for the dissipation of exergy, and is defined in words as the Quality Factor which takes into account the emerging Quality associated to other forms of Energy * Tr_{theta}: accounts for the increase of Transformity as a consequence of the Emergy generated by the Source Terms of the Universe Under these definitions \\"emergy\\" can always be structured as follows: Em_U= Tr_{theta}.Tr_{ex}.Ex_U ==References== *B.R.

In August 2004, Edwards appealed the ban, and an arbitration panel acknowledged that Edwards \\"conducted herself with honesty, integrity and character ... she has not sought to gain any improper advantage or to 'cheat' in any way.\\" In November 2005, her two-year ban was shortened to 15 months when the World Anti-Doping Agency downgraded nikethamide infractions to maximum one-year suspensions. The drug had come from pills she had taken at a meet in Martinique to combat a minor illness. Though arbitrators decided Edwards had taken the drug inadvertently, saying in their ruling that she had conducted herself with \\"honesty, integrity and character,\\" they did not overturn the suspension, because the glucose tablets given to her by her doctor contained a warning for athletes advising that the pills could cause a positive doping test. Therefore, Edwards did not take performance enhancement drugs to improve her performance.USADA Sanctions. USADA. Retrieved on 2015-01-23.

Williams picked up the baton to finish the race in last place, but the USA was disqualified because she had had to run out of her lane in order to retrieve the baton. ==International competitions== { - 2000 Summer Olympics Sydney, Australia bgcolor=\\"CC9966\\"  3rd 4√ó100 m relay DQ - doping by Marion Jones - rowspan=62003 World Indoor Championships Birmingham, United Kingdom bgcolor=\\"silver\\" 2nd 60 m  - rowspan=3World Championships rowspan=3Paris, France bgcolor=\\"gold\\" 1st 100 m  10.93 PB - bgcolor=\\"silver\\" 2nd 200 m  - bgcolor=\\"silver\\" 2nd 4√ó100 m relay  - rowspan=2World Athletics Final rowspan=2Monte Carlo, Monaco bgcolor=\\"CC9966\\" 3rd 100 m  - bgcolor=\\"CC9966\\" 3rd 200 m  - 2008 Olympic Games Beijing, China 8th 100 m } ==Coaching career== Torri Edwards was just named head track coach at Kentucky State University in August 2015. Torri Edwards brings a wealth of experience, both as a coach and as a former world-class sprinter to the University of Kentucky track and field teams (2014 and 2015). She worked 2 seasons with the UK track and field programs. Coach Edwards served as an assistant coach in the Riverside Community College track and field program. While serving as an assistant at RCC, Edwards helped the men's track and field team capture conference and state titles in 2012 and 2013. Edwards most recently worked as a volunteer assistant at Cal Poly Pomona the past two years. She helped Angela Garcia reach the NCAA Division II National Championships in just her first collegiate season of track and field. Garcia also earned All-West Region honors for her work in the 100- and 200-meter events. While Edwards was at Cal Poly Pomona, the teams boasted 12 individual conference champions, and more than 25 Broncos received All-CCAA honors. ==See also== *List of doping cases in athletics ==References== ==External links== * *Torri Edwards' U.S. Olympic Team bio *Torri Edwards wins Nike Prefontaine Classic, in Eugene, Oregon Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:American female sprinters Category:African-American female track and field athletes Category:Olympic track and field athletes of the United States Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Pan American Games track and field athletes for the United States Category:Pan American Games medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1999 Pan American Games Category:Doping cases in athletics Category:World Athletics Championships athletes for the United States Category:World Athletics Championships medalists Category:World Athletics Indoor Championships medalists Category:American sportspeople in doping cases Category:Medalists at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic bronze medalists for the United States in track and field Category:Pan American Games silver medalists for the United States Category:Track and field athletes from California Category:Universiade gold medalists for the United States Category:Universiade medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:USC Trojans women's track and field athletes Category:USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships winners Category:World Athletics Championships winners Category:Medalists at the 1999 Summer Universiade ","title":"Torri Edwards"},{"id":"3253892","text":"Ayr Racecourse at Whitletts Road, Ayr, Scotland,British Racing and Racecourses () by Marion Rose Halpenny ‚Äì Page 71 was opened in 1907. There are courses for flat and for National Hunt racing. ==History== Horse racing in Ayr dates back to 1576, but the first official meeting did not take place until 1771 at a racecourse situated in the Seafield area of the town. This first racecourse was a mile oval with sharp bends. In the early days, racing was supported by the local landed gentry and members of the Caledonian Hunt. Important figures in the course's history have included the Earl of Eglinton, Sir James Boswell and the Duke of Portland. In 1824, Ayr's most important race meeting, the Western Meeting, was established and by 1838 it offered ¬£2000 in prize money and the most valuable two-year-old race of the season in Britain. The meeting's feature race, the Ayr Gold Cup, became a handicap race in 1855 and is now the richest sprint handicap in Europe. Due to the small size of the track and limitations on the size of the paddock, a new site for the racecourse was eventually sought and in 1907, the course was moved to its current location in the Craigie area of town. After extensive research into other British courses, the new course layout was based on that of Newbury, with the exception that Ayr's straight course is six furlongs rather than a mile. The former racecourse is now playing fields, known as the Old Racecourse, and part of Seafield golf course. Local road names Racecourse Road and Racecourse View also reflect this history. A jumps track was added in 1950 and in 1966 the Scottish Grand National was transferred to the track after Bogside Racecourse was closed down. It is now regarded as the premier racecourse in Scotland. ==Characteristics== ===Flat=== Flat races at Ayr are run over the following distances: *5 furlongs *6 furlongs *7 furlongs 50 yards *1 mile *1 mile 1 furlong 20 yards *10 furlongs *1 mile 2 furlongs 192 yards (disused) *1 mile 5 furlongs 13 yards *1 mile 7 furlongs *2 miles 1 furlong 105 yards The track is a left-handed oval of 12 furlongs including a half mile run in. A six furlong chute joins the round track after just over a furlong. The course is generally flat, with gentle undulations, particularly in the straight. The turns are well graded and it can be regarded as basically a fair track. ===Jumps=== Hurdle races are run over distances of: *2 miles 1 furlong *2 miles 4 furlongs *2 miles 6 furlongs *3 miles 110 yards *3 miles 2 furlongs 110 yards *3 miles 3 furlongs 110 yards Chases are run over: *2 miles *2 miles 4 furlongs *2 miles 5 furlongs 110 yards *3 miles 1 furlong *3 miles 2 furlongs 110 yards *3 miles 3 furlongs 110 yards *3 miles 5 furlongs *4 miles 110 yards (Scottish National) The jumps course is a left-handed one and a half mile circuit with nine fences. It runs downhill to the home turn and thereafter there is a gentle rise to the finish, a run-in of 210 yards. Conditions can get extremely gruelling. ==Facilities== The paddock stand at Ayr is named the Rothesay Stand in honour of Charles and Camilla, Duke and Duchess of Rothesay. ==Awards== Ayr has been voted Best Racecourse in Scotland and the North East nineteen times by the Racegoers Club, including nine years in a row up until 2013. It has also won the Neil Wyatt Ground Staff Award for the Best Dual Purpose Course twice ‚Äì in 1996 and 2011. This award is voted on by representatives of the National Trainers Federation and Professional Jockeys' Association to recognise the achievements of racecourse groundstaff. In 2012, Ayr was nominated in two categories in the Racecourse Association Showcase Awards ‚Äì the Food and Beverage and Owners' Experience categories, winning the latter. It has been designated a five star visitor attraction by VisitScotland. ==Facts and figures== ===Flat=== *Number of fixtures (2016) ‚Äì 19 *Prize money (2015) ‚Äì ¬£1,384,100 *Top jockey (2010‚Äì2015) ‚Äì Graham Lee *Top owner (2010‚Äì2015) ‚Äì Johnie Delta Racing *Top trainer (2010‚Äì2015) ‚Äì Jim Goldie *Top trainer (2007 ‚Äì 2011 inc.) ‚Äì Richard Fahey, 55 wins from 325 runs ===Jumps=== *Top trainer (2007 ‚Äì 2011 inc.) ‚Äì Donald McCain, 44 wins from 319 runs ==Notable races== { class = \\"sortable\\"  border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" style=\\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\\" - bgcolor=\\"#77dd77\\" align=\\"center\\" ! style=\\"width:70px\\" Month ! style=\\"width:80px\\" DOW !

The most common form of the ceremony involves turning on Christmas lights. One of the older of such community events began at Colonial Williamsburg, the restored Historic District of the former Virginia capital city of Williamsburg in 1935. It is held there each year on the Sunday of the first full weekend in December. (That is, if December begins on a Sunday, the event is held the following Sunday.) Williamsburg's Grand Illumination, which also involves fireworks, is based loosely on the colonial (and English) tradition of placing lighted candles in the windows of homes and public buildings to celebrate a special event. The winning of a war and the birthday of the reigning monarch are examples of such national events. Many candles appeared in darkened windows in New York after the September 11, 2001 attacks. In recent times, in many cities much larger than Williamsburg, such as Richmond, Virginia, multiple skyscrapers and other buildings are decorated with long mostly vertical strings of lights of a common theme, and are activated simultaneously in \\"Grand Illumination\\" ceremonies. Some communities, such as Norfolk, Virginia and Asheville, North Carolina, have Grand Illumination parades. In Chattanooga, Tennessee, a similar event is called the \\"Grand Illumination On The River.\\" In Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts, on Martha's Vineyard, Grand Illumination is one of the most significant events each summer, immediately preceded by a Community Sing.

Widely known by its former trade name of Coramine, it was used in the mid-twentieth century as a medical countermeasure against tranquilizer overdoses, before the advent of endotracheal intubation and positive-pressure lung expansion. It is no longer commonly considered to be of value for such purposes. In alternate terminology, it is known as nicotinic acid diethylamide, which meaningfully emphasizes its laboratory origins, and of which its common name is derived as a blend. == Former and current medical use == Coramine injection kit from the Second World War (Auckland War Memorial Museum, New Zealand) Coramine was used by suspected serial killer John Bodkin Adams when treating patient Gertrude Hullett, whom he was suspected of murdering. However, the toxicity of nikethamide is quite low ( rabbits 650 mg/kg oral, LD50 rats 240 mg/kg subcutaneous). Theodor Morell, Adolf Hitler's personal physician, would inject the German ruler with Coramine when Hitler was unduly sedated with barbiturates. In addition, Morell would use Coramine as part of an all-purpose \\"tonic\\" for Hitler. It is available as a short-acting over-the-counter drug in several South American and European countries, combined with glucose in form of lozenges. It is especially useful for mountain climbers to increase endurance at high altitudes. Contraindications include hypertension, cardiovascular pathologies and epilepsy.Nikethamid , III-3.3, Toxcenter == Use in sports == In some sports, nikethamide is listed by the World Anti-Doping Agency as a banned substance.

Over 200 residential and other buildings were found to have been built using the material. About 7000 people are believed to have been exposed to long-term low-level irradiation as a result. In the summer of 1992, a utility worker for the Taiwanese state-run electric utility Taipower brought a Geiger counter to his apartment to learn more about the device, and discovered that his apartment was contaminated. Despite awareness of the problem, owners of some of the buildings suspected to be contaminated have continued to rent apartments out to tenants (in part because selling the units is illegal). Some research has found that the radiation has had an apparent \\"beneficial\\" effect upon the health of the tenants based on the death rate from cancers. (ecolo.org and authors of the paper are not associated with one another.) Another study looking at the incidence of cancer found that although the overall risk of cancer was sharply reduced (SIR = 0.6, 95% CI 0.5 ‚Äì 0.7), the incidence of certain leukemias in men (n = 6, SIR = 3.4, 95% CI 1.2 ‚Äì 7.4) and thyroid cancer in women (n = 6, SIR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.0 ‚Äì 5.7) was greater. *December 6, 1983 ‚Äì Ciudad Ju√°rez, Mexico. A local resident salvaged materials from a discarded radiation therapy machine containing 6,010 pellets of 60Co. The transport of the material led to severe contamination of his truck. When the truck was scrapped, it in turn contaminated another 5,000 metric tonnes of steel to an estimated of activity. This steel was used to manufacture kitchen and restaurant table legs and rebar, some of which was shipped to the U.S. and Canada. The incident was discovered months later when a truck delivering contaminated building materials to the Los Alamos National Laboratory drove through a radiation monitoring station. Contamination was later measured on roads used to transport the original damaged radiation source. Some pellets were actually found embedded in the roadway. In the state of Sinaloa, 109 houses were condemned due to use of contaminated building material. This incident prompted the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Customs Service to install radiation detection equipment at all major border crossings. *1985 to 1987 ‚Äì The Therac-25 was a radiation therapy machine produced by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL). It is known to be responsible for six accidents between 1985 and 1987, in which patients were given massive overdoses of radiation, which were in some cases on the order of hundreds of grays. Three patients died as a result of the overdoses. These accidents highlighted the dangers of inadequate software control of safety-critical systems. *September 13, 1987 ‚Äì In the Goi√¢nia accident, scavengers broke open a radiation-therapy machine in an abandoned clinic in Goi√¢nia, Brazil. They sold the kilocurie (40 TBq) caesium-137 source as a glowing curiosity. Two hundred and fifty people were contaminated; four died.‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ *June 6, 1988 ‚Äì Radiation Sterilizers, Inc. (now Sterigenics) in Decatur, Georgia reported a leak of 137Cs at their facility. Seventy thousand medical supply containers and milk cartons were recalled. *5 February 1989 ‚Äì Three workers were exposed to gamma rays from the 60Co source in a medical products irradiation plant in San Salvador, El Salvador. The most exposed person died; another lost a limb. A number of safety systems at the plant had been disabled, and workers were unaware of the danger posed by the radioactive source. *1989 ‚Äì In the Kramatorsk radiological accident, a small capsule containing highly radioactive 137Cs was found inside the concrete wall in an apartment building in Kramatorsk, Ukrainian SSR. It is believed that the capsule, originally contained in a measurement device, was lost sometime during the late 1970s and ended up mixed in with gravel used to construct that building in 1980. By the time the capsule was discovered, six residents of the building had died from leukemia and 17 more received varying doses of radiation. ==1990s== *June 24, 1990 ‚Äì Soreq, Israel ‚Äì An operator at a commercial irradiation facility bypassed safety systems to clear a jam in the product conveyor area. The one- to two-minute exposure resulted in a whole body dose estimated at 10 Gy (1,000 rad) or more. He died 36 days later despite extensive medical care. *December 10‚Äì20, 1990 ‚Äì a radiological accident that occurred at the Clinic of Zaragoza, in Spain. In the accident, at least 27 patients were injured, and 11 of them died, according to IAEA. All of the injured were cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. *October 26, 1991 ‚Äì Nesvizh, Belarus ‚Äì An operator at an atomic sterilization facility bypassed the safety systems to clear a jammed conveyor. Upon entering the irradiation chamber he was exposed to an estimated whole body dose of 11 Gy, with some portions of the body receiving upwards of 20 Gy. Despite prompt intensive medical care, he died 113 days after the accident. *November 16, 1992 ‚Äì Indiana Regional Cancer Center ‚Äì After treating a patient with HDR brachytherapy, personnel ignored alarms indicating high radiation levels and an available radiation survey meter was not used to confirm or rule out the area alarm's signal. A radioactive pellet of iridium-192 had broken off inside the patient during treatment. The patient was transported back to a nursing home where the catheter containing the radioactive pellet fell out four days later. The patient received a thousand times the intended dose and died several days later. *November 19, 1992 ‚Äì A 60Co source (which were used for an agricultural project) was taken home by a worker from a well within a construction site which used to be part of an environmental monitoring station in Xinzhou, Shanxi (China). This resulted in three deaths and affected 100+ people. A woman was exposed to radiation while nursing her sick husband. Her dose was estimated to be 2.3 Gy by means of a blood test 41 days after the accident, 16 years after the accident the woman has been subject to premature aging which may be a result of her radiation exposure. Her then unborn child (induced at 37 weeks, birth weight 2 kilograms) got a dose of almost 2 Gy in utero, at the age of 16 the child had an IQ of 46, and her second baby died because of an incident six months into pregnancy eight years after the event. *August 31, 1994 ‚Äì Commerce Township, Michigan ‚Äì A home-made neutron source built by 17-year-old David Hahn was discovered in his mother's back yard. The unshielded neutron source exposed his neighborhood to 1,000 times the normal levels of background radiation.Ken Silverstein The radioactive boy scout: When a teenager attempts to build a breeder reactor Harper's Magazine, November 1998 *October 21, 1994 ‚Äì a large caesium-137 source was stolen by scrap metal scavengers in Tammiku, M√§nniku, Saku Parish, Estonia. The man who carried the source home received a 4,000 rad whole-body dose and died 12 days after first taking it. *September, 1996 ‚Äì San Jos√©, Costa Rica: A cobalt radiation therapy device was not properly tuned and 116 patients that were undergoing treatment were irradiated with a very high dose. *May 1998 ‚Äì Acerinox accident ‚Äì recycler Acerinox in C√°diz, Spain, unwittingly melted scrap metal containing radioactive sources; the radioactive cloud drifted to Switzerland before being detected.Radioactive Scrap Metal Nuclear Free Local Authorities *December 1998 ‚Äì Istanbul, Turkey ‚Äì two sealed transport packages for spent 60Co teletherapy sources from a shipment of three planned for export in 1993 were instead stored in a warehouse in Ankara, then moved to Istanbul, where a new owner sold them off as scrap metal. The buyers dismantled the containers, exposing themselves and others to ionizing radiation. Eighteen people, including seven children, were admitted to hospital. Ten of the adults developed acute radiation syndrome. One exposed 60Co source was retrieved, but the source from the other package was still unaccounted for one year later. It is believed that the second container was empty all along, but this could not be conclusively proven from company records. *1999 ‚Äì A road near Mrima Hill, Kenya was rebuilt using local materials later found to be radioactive. Some workers were exposed to excessive radiation, and many residents of the area were tested for exposure. 2,975 metric tons of roadway material were to be dug up to eliminate the hazard. ==2000s== *February 1, 2000 ‚Äì Samut Prakan radiation accident: The radiation source of an expired teletherapy unit was purchased and transferred without registration, and stored in an unguarded car park in Samut Prakan, Thailand without warning signs. Bangkok Post, 2009 It was then stolen from the car park and dismantled in a junkyard for scrap metal. Workers completely removed the 60Co source from the lead shielding, and became ill shortly thereafter. The radioactive nature of the metal and the resulting contamination was not discovered until 18 days later. Seven injuries and three deaths were a result of this incident. *August 2000 ‚Äì March 2001; at the Instituto Oncologico Nacional of Panama, 28 patients receiving treatment for prostate cancer and cancer of the cervix received lethal doses of radiation due to a modification in the protocol for measuring radiation used without a verification test. The negligence, unique in its scope, was investigated by the IAT from May 26 ‚Äì June 1, 2001. *February 2001 ‚Äì A medical accelerator at the Bialystok Oncology Center in Poland malfunctioned, resulting in five female patients receiving excessive doses of radiation while undergoing breast cancer treatment. The incident was discovered when one of the patients complained of a painful radiation burn. In response, a local technician was called in to repair the device, but was unable to do so, and in fact caused further damage. Subsequently, competent authorities were notified, but as the apparatus had been tampered with, they were unable to ascertain the exact doses of radiation received by the patients (localized doses might have been in excess of 60 Gy). No deaths were reported as a result of this incident, although all affected patients required skin grafts. The attending doctor was charged with criminal negligence, but in 2003 a district court ruled that she was not responsible for the incident. The hospital technician was fined. *In the village of Lia, Georgia, on December 2, 2001, Three lumberjacks discovered two 90Sr cores from Soviet radioisotope thermoelectric generators. These were of the Beta-M type, built in the 80s, with an activity of 1295 TBq each. The lumberjacks were scavenging the forest for firewood, when they came across two metal cylinders melting snow within a one meter radius laying in the road. They picked up these objects to use as personal heaters, sleeping with their backs to them. All lumberjacks sought medical attention individually, and were treated for radiation injuries. One patient, DN-1, was seriously injured and required multiple skin grafts. After 893 days in the hospital, he was declared dead after a fever caused by complications and infections of a radiation ulcer on the subject's back. The disposal team consisted of 25 men who were restricted to a maximum of 2 minutes worth of exposure (max. 20mSv) each while transferring the canisters to lead-lined drums. A video documenting the training for the recovery and the recovery itself in Lia, Georgia, 10 minute silent documentation about the recovery. *March 11, 2002 ‚Äì INES Level 2 ‚Äì A 2.5 tonne 60Co gamma source was transported from Cookridge Hospital, Leeds, to Sellafield with defective shielding at the bottom of the container. As the radiation escaped from the package downwards into the ground, it is thought that this event did not cause any injury or disease in either a human or an animal. This event was treated in a serious manner because the defence in depth type of protection for the source had been eroded. Had the container been tipped over in a road crash then people at the scene would have been in danger of exposure to a strong beam of gamma rays (83.5 Gy/h). The company responsible for the transport of the source, AEA Technology plc, was fined ¬£250,000 by a British court.\\"Transport case prompts HSE reminder on the importance of radiation protection controls.\\" Health and Safety Executive. 20 February 2006. *2003 ‚Äì Cape of Navarin, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Russia. A radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) located on the Arctic shore was discovered in a highly degraded state. The exposure rate at the generator surface was as high as 15 R/h; in July 2004 a second inspection of the same RTG showed that gamma radiation emission had risen to 87 R/h and that 90Sr had begun to leak into the environment. In November 2003, a completely dismantled RTG located on the island of Yuzhny Goryachinsky in the Kola Bay was found. The generator's radioactive heat source was found on the ground near the shoreline in the northern part of the island. *September 10, 2004 ‚Äì Yakutia, Russia. Two radioisotope thermoelectric generators were dropped 50 meters onto the tundra at Zemlya Bunge island during an airlift when the helicopter flew into heavy weather. According to the nuclear regulators, the impact compromised the RTGs' external radiation shielding. At a height of 10 meters above the impact site, the intensity of gamma radiation was measured at 4 mSv/h. *2005 ‚Äì Dounreay, U.K. In September, the site's cementation plant was closed when 266 liters of radioactive reprocessing residues were spilled inside containment. In October, another of the site's reprocessing laboratories was closed down after nose-blow tests of eight workers tested positive for trace radioactivity. *2005-2006 ‚Äì : a problem in dosimetry software caused an overdosage during radiotherapy. During this period 7500 patients were treated for prostate cancer at the Jean Monnet Hospital in Epinal, France. An investigation showed that 5 people died from radiation, 24 were severely injured, 700 were significantly overexposed and 4500 more mildly. *March 11, 2006 ‚Äì at Fleurus, Belgium, an operator working for Sterigenics, at a medical equipment sterilization site, entered the irradiation room and remained there for 20 seconds. The room contained a source of 60Co which was not immersed in the pool of water. Three weeks later, the worker suffered symptoms typical of acute radiation syndrome (vomiting, loss of hair, fatigue). One estimate that he was exposed to a dose of between 4.4 and 4.8 Gy due to a malfunction of the control-command hydraulic system maintaining the radioactive source in the pool. The operator spent over one month in a specialized hospital before going back home. To protect workers, the federal nuclear control agency AFCN and private auditors from AVN recommended Sterigenics to install a redundant system of security. It is an accident of level 4 on the INES scale. *Teenager Lisa Norris died in 2006 after having been given an overdose of radiation as a result of human error during treatment for a brain tumor at Beatson Oncology Centre in Glasgow (Scotland). The Scottish Government published an independent investigation of this case. The intended treatment for Norris was 35 Gy to be delivered by a linac machine to the whole of the central nervous system to be delivered in twenty equal fractions of 1.75 Gy, which was to be followed by 19.8 Gy to be delivered to the tumor only (in eleven fractions of 1.8 Gy). In the first phase of the treatment a 58% overdose occurred, and Norris's CNS suffered a dose of 55.5 Gy. The second phase of the treatment was abandoned on medical advice, and Norris survived for some time after the overdose. *January 23, 2008 ‚Äì A licensed radiology technologist, Raven Knickerbocker, at Mad River Community Hospital in Arcata, California performed 151 CT scan slices on a single 3 mm level on the head of a 23-month-old child over a 65-minute period. The child suffered radiation burns (skin erythema) to a small strip of his face and head. In one report, an independent investigation of the child's blood was said to have found \\"substantial chromosomal damage\\" but subsequent reports reported no lasting harm. The technologist was fired, and her license was permanently revoked on March 16, 2011 by the state of California, citing \\"gross negligence\\". The hospital's radiology manager, Bruce Fleck, testified that Knickerbocker's conduct was \\"a rogue act of insanity\\". *August 23‚Äì24, 2008 ‚Äì INES Level 3 ‚Äì Fleurus, Belgium ‚Äì Nuclear material leak. A gaseous leak of a radioisotope of iodine, 131I, was detected at a large medical radioisotope laboratory, Institut national des Radio-El√©ments. Belgian authorities implemented restrictions on use of local farming produce within 5 km of the leak, when higher-than-expected levels of contamination was detected in local grass. The particular isotope of iodine has a half-life of 8 days. The European Commission sent out a warning over their ECURIE-alert system on the 29th of August. The quantity of radioactivity released into the environment was estimated at 45 GBq I-131, which corresponds to a dose of 160 microsievert (effective dose) for a hypothetical person remaining permanently at the site's enclosure.IAEA NEWS database: Iodine-131 release in the environment *February 2008-August 2009 ‚Äì A software misconfiguration in a CT scanner used for brain perfusion scanning at Cedar Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, resulted in 206 patients receiving radiation doses approximately 8 times higher than intended during an 18-month period starting in February 2008. Some patients reported temporary hair loss and erythema. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has estimated that patients received doses between 3 Gy and 4 Gy.Safety Investigation of CT Brain Perfusion Scans: Initial Notification: ==2010s== *April 2010 ‚Äì INES level 4 ‚Äì A 35-year-old man was hospitalized in New Delhi after handling radioactive scrap metal. Investigation led to the discovery of an amount of scrap metal containing 60Co in the New Delhi industrial district of Mayapuri. The 35-year-old man later died from his injuries, while six others remained hospitalized. The radioactivity was from a gammacell 220 research source which was incorrectly disposed of by sale as scrap metal. The gammacell 220 was originally made by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited whose gamma irradation work is now under the name of Nordion. Nordion do not offer servicing for gammacell 220 machines but can arrange for, in theory, safe disposal of unwanted units. *July 2010 ‚Äì During a routine inspection at the Port of Genoa, on Italy's northwest coast, a cargo container from Saudi Arabia containing nearly of scrap copper was detected to be emitting gamma radiation at a rate of around After quarantining the container for over a year in quarantine on Port grounds, Italian officials dissected it using robots and discovered a rod of 60Co long and 0.8 cm in diameter intermingled with the scrap. Officials suspected its provenance to be inappropriately disposed-of medical or food-processing equipment. The rod was sent to Germany for further analysis, after which it was likely to be recycled. *October 2011 ‚Äì At a hospital in Rio de Janeiro, a 7-year-old girl was treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia with whole brain radiation. The prescriptions were done manually in a form with no formal peer review process. Because of an error in the registration of the number of sessions, she received the full dose in each session of radiotherapy. Even with early toxicity, the doctor refused to assess the patient, because some of the complaints were usual. The full treatment was finished in about 8 sessions and the girl was admitted with radiation burns. She developed frontal lobe necrosis and died in June 2012. After an investigation, the physicist, technician, and physician were charged with manslaughter. *May 2013 ‚Äì J-PARC radioactive isotope leakage accident. On 23 May 2013, accidental leakage of radioactive isotopes occurred in the high-intensity proton accelerator facility, one of the nuclear research facilities in Tokai-mura, Ibaraki Prefecture. In addition to the diffusion of radioactive isotopes due to the malfunction of equipment, the response to the accident was mishandled, with 33 out of 55 personnel who were on site at the time exposed. A small amount of radioactive isotope leaked outside the controlled area as well. This incident was tentatively evaluated as an International Nuclear Event Scale Level 1 event by the Japanese Nuclear Regulatory Commission. *May 2013 ‚Äì A batch of metal-studded belts sold by online retailer ASOS.com were confiscated and held in a U.S. radioactive storage facility after testing positive for 60Co. *December 2013 ‚Äì A truck transporting a 111 TBq 60Co teletherapy source from a Tijuana hospital to a waste storage facility was hijacked near Mexico City. This triggered a nationwide search by Mexican authorities. The truck was found a day later near Hueypoxtla, where it was discovered that the source had been removed from its shielding. The source was found shortly after in a nearby field, where it was safely recovered. The thieves could have received a fatal dose of radiation. *August 2018 ‚Äì A 23kg radioactive source used for industrial radiography (detecting defects in metal weldments) went missing from the back of a pickup truck during transportation in Malaysia. It contains iridium-192 and was reported missing on August 10. This is not the first time such an incident happened. ==See also== *Background radiation *International Nuclear Event Scale *List of military nuclear accidents *List of nuclear reactors *List of nuclear whistleblowers *Lists of disasters *Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents *Nuclear power debate *Nuclear power *Nuclear reactor *Radiation *X-ray ==References== ==External links== *Schema- root.org: Nuclear Power Accidents 2 topics, both with a current news feed *U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) website with search function and electronic public reading room *International Atomic Energy Agency website with extensive online library *Canada's Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) *Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety Detailed articles on nuclear watchdog activities in the US *Canadian Centre for Occupational Health & Safety Information on radiation units and doses *Radiological Incidents Database Extensive, well-referenced list of radiological incidents. *Civilian nuclear incidents in the UK since 2001 * * Civilian radiation Civilian Radiation Accidents Category:Radioactivity cs:Jadern√° hav√°rie de:Liste der nuklearen Unf√§lle fr:Liste des accidents nucl√©aires ja:ÂéüÂ≠êÂäõ‰∫ãÊïÖ ","title":"List of civilian radiation accidents"},{"id":"3253964","text":"Aaron Henneman (born 13 December 1980) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Essendon in the Australian Football League (AFL).

It marked a transition from the classic feudal form of anti-colonial revolt to modern independence struggles. It was fundamentally a peasant revolt. ==Background== The Kandyan provinces were in a state of turmoil. They had been under British rule for 32 years. Under the Crown Lands (Encroachments) Ordinance No. 12 of 1840 (sometimes called the Crown Lands Ordinance or the Waste Lands Ordinance), the British had expropriated the common land of the peasantry and reduced them to penury. In the 1830s, coffee was introduced into Ceylon, a crop which flourishes in high altitudes, and grown on the land taken from the peasants. The principal impetus to this development was the decline in coffee production in the West Indies, following the abolition of slavery there. However, the dispossessed peasantry were not employed on the plantations: The Kandyan villagers refused to abandon their traditional subsistence holdings and become wage-workers in the nightmarish conditions that prevailed on these new estates, despite all the pressure exerted by the colonial state. The British therefore had to draw on its reserve army of labour in India, to man its lucrative new outpost to the south. An infamous system of contract labour was established, which transported hundreds of thousands of Tamil 'coolies' from southern India into Sri Lanka for the coffee estates. These Tamils labourers died in tens of thousands both on the journey itself as well as on the plantations. An economic depression in the United Kingdom had severely affected the local coffee and cinnamon industry. Planters and merchants clamoured for a reduction of export duties. Sir James Emerson Tennent, the Colonial Secretary in Colombo recommended to Earl Grey, Secretary of State for the Colonies in London that taxation should be radically shifted from indirect taxation to direct taxation, which proposal was accepted. It was decided to abolish the export duty on coffee and reduce the export duty on cinnamon leaving a deficit of ¬£40,000 Sterling which was to be met by direct taxes on the people. A new Governor, 35-year-old Lord Torrington, a cousin of Prime Minister Lord Russell was dispatched to Colombo by Queen Victoria to carry out these reforms. On 1 July 1848, license fees were imposed on guns, dogs, carts, shops and labour was made compulsory on plantation roads, unless a special tax was paid. These taxes bore heavily not only on the purse but also on the traditions of the Kandyan peasant. A mass movement against the oppressive taxes was developing. The masses were without the leadership of their native King (deposed in 1815) or their chiefs (either crushed after the Uva Rebellion or collaborating with the colonial power). The leadership passed for the first time in the Kandyan provinces into the hands of ordinary people. ==Rebellion== On 26 July 1848, the leaders and the supporters entered the historic Dambulla Vihara and at 11.30 a.m., Gongalegoda Banda was consecrated by the head monk of Dambulla, Ven. Giranegama Thera. Gongalegoda Banda was called \\"Sri Wickrama Subha Sarva Siddhi Rajasinghe\\". He asked the people whether they were on the side of the Buddhists or the British. On the same day Dines, his brother was declared the sub-king and Dingirala as the uncrowned king of the Sat Korale (Seven Counties). Veera Puran Appu was appointed prime minister and the sword bearer to Gongalegoda Banda and attended his consecration ceremony with 4000 others. After the proclamation of the king, he with his army left Dambulla via Matale to capture Kandy from the British. They attacked government buildings including the Matale Kachcheri and destroyed some of the tax records. Simultaneously, Dingirirala instigated attacks in Kurunegala, where eight people were shot dead by the British army. Governor Torrington immediately declared Martial Law on 29 July 1848 in Kandy and on 31 July in Kurunegala. Puran Appu was taken prisoner by the British troops and was executed on 8 August. Gongalegoda Banda and his younger brother Dines escaped and went into hiding. Gongalegoda Banda lived in a cave at Elkaduwa, from Matale. Torrington issued a warrant for his arrest with a reward of ¬£150 for information on his whereabouts. On 21 September, he was arrested by Malay soldiers ‚Äî although he offered resistance before his arrest - and was brought from Matale to Kandy where he was kept a prisoner. The trial of Gongalegoda Banda commenced on 27 November at the Supreme Court sessions in Kandy. He was charged with high treason for claiming to be King of Kandy and waging war against the British. He declared that he was guilty of all the charges. The Supreme Court condemned him to be hanged on 1 January 1849. Subsequently, a proclamation was issued to amend the death sentence to flogging 100 times and deportation to Malacca (Malaysia). Puran Appu, even though his leg of the rebellion was successful in capturing Matale, and was proclaimed as the King of Sinhale by people, was eventually captured, taken to Kandy and executed. ==Leaders== The Matale Rebellion was led by leaders such as, Paranagama Nilame, Swarnapali Paranagama Kumarihami (daughter of Paranagama nilame ), Suriyabandara Nilame (King Of Mathale) (Son), Gongalegoda Banda, Dines, Dingi Rala and Puran Appu who were supported by the people and the village headmen of Matale. These were workers with links to the low country, with rather broader vision than the Kandyan peasants they led. ===Gongalegoda Banda=== Gongalegoda Banda, the son of Wansapurna Dewage Sinchia Fernando was the leader of the 1848 Rebellion and King of Kandy. He had been employed by the police and came to reside at Gongalegoda, Udunuwara where he became a popular figure among the Kandyans. He was seen at the Temple of the Tooth just before the 1848 Rebellion broke out. Gongalegoda Banda led a protest march regarding unjustifiable taxes on 6 July 1848, near the Kandy Kachcheri. ===Veera Puran Appu=== Weerahennedige Francisco Fernando alias Veera Puran Appu is one of the most colourful personalities in Sri Lanka's history. He was born on November 1812 in the coastal town of Moratuwa. He left Moratuwa at the age of 13 and stayed in Ratnapura with his uncle, who was the first Sinhalese proctor, and moved to the Uva Province. In early 1847, he met and married Bandaramenike, the daughter of Gunnepana Arachchi in Kandy. ==Legacy== Memorial of the Matale Rebellion in Matale The Matale Rebellion was the first transitional step towards abandoning the feudal form of revolt, being fundamentally a peasant revolt. The masses were without the leadership of their native King (deposed in 1815), or their chiefs (either crushed after the Uva Rebellion or collaborating with the colonial power). The leadership passed for the first time in the Kandyan provinces into the hands of ordinary people. The leaders were yeomen-artisans, resembling the Levellers in England's revolution, and mechanics such as Paul Revere and Tom Paine who were at the heart of the American revolution. The old feudalists were crushed and powerless. No new class capable of leading the struggle and heading it towards power had yet arisen. ==See also== * Fort MacDowall ==References== *Tyronne Fernando, Veera Puran Appu: stood up against the might of British Empire accessed 5 December 2005. *Dr. K.

Large specimens of 190 cm (75 in) total length, weighing over 6.0 kg (13.2 lb) and with a girth of 40 cm (16 in) have been reported. Specimens from Saudi Arabia are not as large, usually no more than in total length. Males are usually larger than females and have relatively longer tails. B. arietans (adult) The color pattern varies geographically. The head has two well-marked dark bands - one on the crown and the other between the eyes. On the sides of the head, two oblique, dark bands or bars run from the eye to the supralabials. Below, the head is yellowish white with scattered dark blotches. Iris color ranges from gold to silver-gray. Dorsally, the ground color varies from straw yellow, to light brown, to orange or reddish brown. This is overlaid with a pattern of 18‚Äì22 backwardly directed, dark brown to black bands that extend down the back and tail. Usually, these bands are roughly chevron-shaped, but may be more U-shaped in some areas. They also form two to six light-and-dark cross-bands on the tail. Some populations are heavily flecked with brown and black, often obscuring other coloration, giving the animal a dusty-brown or blackish appearance. The belly is yellow or white, with a few scattered dark spots. Newborn young have golden head markings with pinkish to reddish ventral plates toward the lateral edges. One unusual specimen, described by Branch and Farrell (1988), from Summer Pride, East London, in South Africa, was striped. The pattern consisted of a narrow (one scale wide), pale yellowish stripe that ran from the crown of the head to the tip of the tail. Generally, though, these are relatively dull-looking snakes, except for male specimens from highland East Africa and Cape Province, South Africa, that usually have a striking yellow-and-black color pattern. ===Scalation=== The head has a less than triangular shape with a blunt and rounded snout. Still, the head is much wider than the neck. The rostral scale is small. The circumorbital ring consists of 10‚Äì16 scales. Across the top of the head, there are 7‚Äì11 interocular scales; three or four scales separate the suboculars and the supralabials. It has 12 to 17 supralabials and 13‚Äì17 sublabials. The first three or four sublabials contact the chin shields, of whichs only one pair exists. Often, two fangs are on each maxilla, and both can be functional. Midbody, the snake has 29‚Äì41 rows of dorsal scales. These are strongly keeled except for the outermost rows. The ventral scale count is 123‚Äì147, the subcaudals number 14‚Äì38. Females have no more than 24 subcaudals. The anal scale is single. ==Distribution and habitat== Distribution of B. arietans in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula This species is probably the most common and widespread snake in Africa. It is found in most of sub-Saharan Africa south to the Cape of Good Hope, including southern Morocco, Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, southern Algeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Sudan, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, northern, eastern, and southern Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Kenya, Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, Angola, Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa. It also occurs on the Arabian Peninsula, where it is found in southwestern Saudi Arabia and Yemen. It is found in all habitats except true deserts, rainforests, and (tropical) alpine habitats. It is most often associated with rocky grasslands.Mehrtens JM. 1987. Living Snakes of the World in Color. New York: Sterling Publishers. 480 pp. . It is not found in rainforest areas, such as along the coast of West Africa and in Central Africa (i.e., central DR Congo); it is also absent from the Mediterranean coastal region of North Africa. On the Arabian Peninsula, it is found as far north as Ta'if. It has been reported to be found in the Dhofar region of southern Oman. ==Behaviour== Normally a sluggish species, the puff adder relies on camouflage for protection. Locomotion is primarily rectilinear, using the broad ventral scales in a caterpillar fashion and aided by its own weight for traction. When agitated, it can resort to a typical serpentine movement of surprising speed. Although mainly terrestrial, these snakes are good swimmers and can also climb with ease; often they are found basking in low bushes. One specimen was found 4.6 m above the ground in a densely branched tree. If disturbed, they hiss loudly and continuously, adopting a tightly coiled defensive posture with the forepart of their body held in a taut \\"S\\" shape. At the same time, they may attempt to back away from the threat towards cover. They may strike suddenly and fast, to the side as easily as forwards, before returning quickly to the defensive position, ready to strike again. During a strike, the force of the impact is so strong, and the long fangs penetrate so deeply, those prey items are often killed by the physical trauma alone. The fangs apparently can penetrate soft leather. They can strike to a distance of about one-third of their body length, but juveniles can launch their entire bodies forwards in the process. These snakes rarely grip their victims, but instead release quickly to return to the striking position. Puff adder puffing (Greyton, Western Cape, South Africa) ==Feeding== Mostly nocturnal, they rarely forage actively, preferring, instead, to ambush prey as it happens by. Their prey includes mammals, birds, amphibians, and lizards. ==Reproduction== B. a. arietans, juvenile (ready to strike) Females produce a pheromone to attract males, which engage in neck- wrestling combat dances. A female in Malindi was followed by seven males. They give birth to large numbers of offspring; litters over 80 have been reported, while 50‚Äì60 are not unusual. Newborns are 12.5‚Äì17.5 cm in length. Very large specimens, particularly those from East Africa, give birth to the highest numbers of offspring. A Kenyan female in a Czech zoo gave birth to 156 young, the largest litter for any species of snake. ==Captivity== These snakes do well in captivity, but gluttony has been reported. Kauffeld (1969) mentions that specimens can be maintained for years on only one meal per week, but that when offered all they can eat, the result is often death, or at best wholesale regurgitation. They are bad-tempered snakes, and some specimens never settle down in captivity, always hissing and puffing when approached. ==Venom== This species is responsible for more snakebite fatalities than any other African snake, due to a combination of factors, including its wide distribution, common occurrence, large size, potent venom that is produced in large amounts, long fangs, and their habit of basking by footpaths and sitting quietly when approached. The venom has cytotoxic effectsWidgerow AD, Ritz M, Song C. 1994. Load cycling closure of fasciotomies following puff adder bite. European Journal of Plastic Surgery 17: 40-42. Summary at Springerlink. Accessed 31 August 2008. and is one of the most toxic of any vipers based on LD50. The values in mice vary: 0.4‚Äì2.0 mg/kg intravenously, 0.9‚Äì3.7 mg/kg peritoneally, and 4.4‚Äì7.7 mg/kg subcutaneously (SC).Brown JH. 1973. Toxicology and Pharmacology of Venoms from Poisonous Snakes. Springfield, Illinois: Charles C. Thomas. 184 pp. LCCCN 73-229. . Mallow et al. (2003) give an LD50 range of 1.0‚Äì7.75 mg/kg SC. Venom yield is typically 150‚Äì350 mg, with a maximum of 750 mg. Brown (1973) mentions a venom yield of 180‚Äì750 mg. About 100 mg are thought to be enough to kill a healthy adult human male, with death occurring after 25 hours. In humans, bites from this species can produce severe local and systemic symptoms. Based on the degree and type of local effect, bites can be divided into two symptomatic categories - those with little or no surface extravasation, and those with hemorrhages evident as ecchymosis, bleeding, and swelling. In both cases, severe pain and tenderness occur, but in the latter, widespread superficial or deep necrosis and compartment syndrome are seen. Serious bites cause limbs to become immovably flexed as a result of significant hemorrhage or coagulation in the affected muscles. Residual induration, however, is rare and usually these areas completely resolve. Other bite symptoms that may occur in humans include edema, which may become extensive, shock, watery blood oozing from the puncture wounds, nausea and vomiting, subcutaneous bruising, blood blisters that may form rapidly, and painful swelling of the regional lymph nodes. Swelling usually decreases after a few days, except for the area immediately around the bite site. Hypotension, together with weakness, dizziness, and periods of semi- or unconsciousness is also reported. If not treated carefully, necrosis will spread, causing skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle to separate from healthy tissue and eventually slough with serous exudate. The slough may be superficial or deep, sometimes down to the bone. Gangrene and secondary infections commonly occur and can result in loss of digits and limbs. The fatality rate highly depends on the severity of the bites and some other factors. Deaths can be exceptional and probably occur in less than 15% of all untreated cases (usually in 2‚Äì4 days from complications following blood volume deficit and disseminated intravascular coagulation), although some reports show that severe envenomations have a 52% mortality rate. Most fatalities are associated with poor clinical management and neglect. ==References== ==Further reading== *Boulenger GA. 1896. Catalogue of the Snakes in the British Museum (Natural History).

In this book, Ripley continues living quietly on his French estate, Belle Ombre, only obliquely involved in criminal activity. His idyll is shaken when he meets a teenaged boy who is hiding from the police. ==Plot summary== A 16-year-old American boy calling himself Billy approaches Tom Ripley in the French village near the latter's residence, asking for a job. Ripley agrees to give him a small amount of gardening work and puts him up in the guest room, but he believes that he recognizes the youth from a newspaper. Further investigation reveals that \\"Billy\\" is actually Frank Pierson, the son of a recently deceased American tycoon who has fled the United States. Frank soon confesses to Ripley that he did in fact murder his own father by pushing him off a cliff. Ripley recognizes a kindred spirit in Frank, discovering that he deliberately sought him out for advice after learning of his questionable reputation. Ripley commissions a false passport for Frank and they travel to West Berlin, where they stay with a friend of Ripley's erstwhile partner in crime, Reeves Minot. Frank is kidnapped while strolling through a wooded area in West Berlin. Ripley communicates with the Pierson family and with a private detective the family has sent to Paris. The Piersons wire the ransom to West Berlin, and Ripley takes it to an appointed drop-off point where he impulsively kills one of the kidnappers. The other three drive off. Ripley returns with the money and arranges a rendezvous at a gay bar, which he infiltrates by dressing in drag. He identifies the kidnappers, who again leave empty-handed, and follows them back to the flat where they are keeping the boy. Ripley scares the amateur thugs into dashing out of the apartment, and he single-handedly rescues the semi-conscious hostage. Ripley then dispatches the money back to the Pierson family, encourages Frank to New England, and accompanies him there besides. Despite Ripley's coaching and reassurances, Frank is overwhelmed by guilt as well as by his unrequited love for a teenaged girl named Teresa, and eventually commits suicide by throwing himself over the same precipice from which he pushed his father. Shaken and, much to his own surprise, saddened by Frank's death, Ripley returns to Belle Ombre after securing a former possession of the boy's as a memento. ==Major themes== Highsmith sets the novel against the oppressive atmosphere of Cold War Germany, and the hedonism of West Berlin, in particular the gay bar scene. Ripley tolerates -- and sympathizes with -- the gay characters he encounters, in contrast to the self- loathing he felt due to his latent attraction to Dickie Greenleaf in The Talented Mr Ripley. Ripley's efforts in protecting Frank, and that stealing the ransom money does not even occur to him, indicate a form of emotionless compassion lacking in the character's behaviour in earlier books. == Adaptations == ===Radio=== The 2009 BBC Radio 4 adaptation stars Ian Hart as Ripley, Nicholas Hoult as Frank and Helen Longworth as Heloise. ==Notes== Category:1980 American novels Category:Novels by Patricia Highsmith Category:Heinemann (publisher) books Category:Patricide in fiction Category:Novels about serial killers Category:Novels about psychopathy ","title":"The Boy Who Followed Ripley"},{"id":"3254040","text":"Euromed may refer to: *Euromed (train) *Barcelona Euro-Mediterranean Conference *Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly == See also == * EU Med Group ","title":"Euromed"},{"id":"3254042","text":"Jane Louise Curry, born September 24, 1932 in East Liverpool, Ohio, is a prolific author of adventure, fantasy, mystery, time travel, and American Indian tales for older children and teenagers.

Recruited from North Ringwood, Salmon had a prolific career, with many accolades such as being inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame, as well as being the 4th highest goal kicker for Essendon, among other things.http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/paul-salmon-inducted-into-afl- hall-of-fame/story-e6frf9jf-1225714213091 At 206 cm (6 ft 9 in), Salmon was at the time, along with Carlton's Justin Madden, the tallest man to play in the AFL. Also known as \\"Fish\\", Salmon was a well-known Full Forward and Ruckman in the Australian Football League over a long period of time.http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/paul-salmon-inducted-into-afl-hall- of-fame/story-e6frf9jf-1225714213091 ==Football career== ===AFL=== Essendon (1983-1995) He made his debut in 1983 with Essendon, however it was during the 1984 VFL season in which he established himself as the league's leading full forward kicking 63 goals in 13 games. Essendon's leading ruckman at the time was Simon Madden, which allowed Bombers coach Kevin Sheedy the luxury of playing the accurate kicking \\"Fish\\" up forward. His effectiveness in the position was due to his athleticism and ability to win one-on-one marking contests, using his superior height and mobility. At the time, Salmon was the VFL's equal tallest player alongside 's Justin Madden (Simon Madden's younger brother), and one of only a handful of VFL players who stood over 200 cm (6'7\\") tall. When leading the goalkicking, halfway through the season, a serious knee injury which required a full reconstruction left him sidelined for over a year, he then recovered to kick 6 goals 4 behinds in the 1985 premiership side. From this point onward he would rotate between full forward and his favoured ruck position with Simon Madden, who was in the twilight of his glittering career. He endured further minor complications with his knee injury and numerous soft tissue injuries over the next few years and was never allowed to settle in a specific role on field, despite this he played a vital role for the team, becoming Vice Captain in 1992, and culminating in leading the Bombers season goal kicking tally on seven occasions, as well as playing in Essendon's 1993 premiership where he kicked 5 goals in helping Essendon to a 20.13 (133) to 13.11 (89) win over Carlton in the Grand Final in front of 96,862 fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. After serious injuries to his Achilles tendon and groins in 1993 and 1994, and with the knowledge time was running out, he decided his time as a 'Bomber' was over at 31 years of age so he requested a new home and was subsequently traded to Hawthorn, the club whom he supported as a child. He was selected in Kevin Sheedy's best team of his 27 years as coach and at number 26 in the 'Champions of Essendon' which was a list of the best of the past century who wore the red and black. Salmon has been quoted saying, that while he has great respect for Kevin Sheedy, he felt at times he didn't get the best out of him, from perhaps lack of communication. But he has also spoken in glowing terms about Kevin Sheedy being good for his career. In such situations such as in late 1985 when Salmon had recently come back from injury, and was out of form and playing in the reserves, Sheedy made a deal with him that if he trained hard, if Essendon made the Grand Final he would play him, regardless of his form. Hawthorn (1995-2000) At the end of 1995, Salmon moved to Hawthorn, where he played from 1995‚Äì2000, and revived his career winning the Best and Fairest in 96 and 97 as well as the Most Consistent Award in 98. He became Vice Captain in 98 and also finished in the top ten in every best and fairest in each of his five years at the club. After 5 season's and 100 games with the Hawks he retired at the age of 35, and after his retirement he was named in Hawthorn's 'Team of the Century'. In 1997, Salmon achieved All-Australian selection, being named in the Ruck. In 1999, he won the Michael Tuck Medal for a best on ground performance in the winning Hawk's night Grand Final. Essendon Comeback Salmon retired from playing football at the end of the 2000 season. He made a comeback in 2002, after being drafted by Essendon at 37 years of age. He played 15 games in 2002 before permanently retiring from AFL football. ===State of Origin=== Salmon had a prolific State of Origin career, kicking 45 goals in 14 games. He first played for Victoria in 1984, against South Australia, kicking 5 goals. Salmon next played at State of Origin level in 1986 against South Australia, kicking 4 goals. In the same year he participated in a game against Western Australia, that has been regarded as \\"one of the greatest games in the 150 year history of Australian Football\\", but didn't trouble the scoreboard. In 1987 he performed well, kicking 5 goals and being named in the best players, against Western Australia in Perth. The following year Salmon performed in the State of Origin Carnival, winning the Tassie Medal, kicking 7 goals in the semi final, and 1 goal in the final. In 1990 he was picked against New South Wales, in a wet day at the SCG, scoring 1 goal, in an upset loss against favourites Victoria. In 1992 he kicked 5 goals against South Australia and was named in the best players.

Buddhism in Afghanistan was one of the major religious forces in the region during pre-Islamic era. The religion was widespread south of the Hindu Kush mountains. Buddhism first arrived in Afghanistan in 305 BC when the Greek Seleucid Empire made an alliance with the Indian Maurya Empire. The resulting Greco-Buddhism flourished under the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (250 BC-125 BC) and the later Indo-Greek Kingdom (180 BC - 10 AD) in modern northern Pakistan and Afghanistan. Greco-Buddhism reached its height under the Kushan Empire, which used the Greek alphabet to write its Bactrian language. Lokaksema (c. 178 AD), who travelled to the Chinese capital of Luoyang and was the first translator of Mahayana Buddhist scriptures into Chinese,Foltz, Religions of the Silk Road, p. 46 and Mahadharmaraksita who, according to the Mahavamsa (Chap. XXIXFull text of the Mahavamsa Click chapter XXIX), led 30,000 Buddhist monks from \\"the Greek city of Alasandra\\" (Alexandria of the Caucasus, around 150 km north of today's Kabul in Afghanistan), to Sri Lanka for the dedication of the Great Stupa in Anuradhapura. The Greco-Bactrian King Menander I, (Pali) \\"Milinda,\\" ruled 165 BC - 135 BC, was a renowned patron of Buddhism immortalized in the Buddhist text the Milinda Panha. The famous Persian Buddhist monastery in Balkh in northern Afghanistan, known as Nava Vihara (\\"New Monastery\\"), functioned as the center of Central Asia Buddhist learning for centuries. The Buddhist religion in Afghanistan started fading with the Muslim conquest in the 7th century but finally ended during the Ghaznavids in the 11th century. ==History== The territory within the borders of Afghanistan has seen many cultural and religious shifts over the centuries. The geographical position of the area between the Middle East, South Asian, and Central Asian cultures, and the proximity to the famous Silk Road (connecting East Asian and Mediterranean civilizations, and others in between), have been major drivers of local historical and cultural developments. One major influence was the conquest of the area by Alexander the Great, which incorporated the area for a time into the Hellenistic World, and resulted in a strong Hellenistic influence on Buddhist religious art in that region. In 305 BC, the Seleucid Empire made an alliance with the Indian Maurya Empire. The Mauryans brought Buddhism from India and controlled the area south of the Hindu Kush until about 185 BC when they were overthrown. Mes Aynak stupa At the time of these developments, most of the area belonged to the kingdoms of Bactria and Sogdiana, including the Scythians, followed Buddhism until the arrival of Islam. Many monuments testify to the Buddhist culture in present- day Afghanistan. Greek cultural and artistic influence in the region can be researched under Buddhist art and Greco-Buddhism. Additional historical detail can be researched under Pre Islamic Hindu and Buddhist heritage of Afghanistan and Hinduism in Afghanistan. Soon after the Sassanian Persian dynasty fell to the Muslims (in 651 AD), the Nava Vihara monastery in Balkh came under Muslim rule (in 663 AD), but the monastery continued to function for at least another century. In 715 AD, after an insurrection in Balkh was crushed by the Abbasid Caliphate, many Persian Buddhist monks fled east along the Silk Road to the Buddhist Kingdom of Khotan, which spoke a related Eastern Iranian language, and onward into China. Nava Vihara's hereditary administrators, the Persian Barmakids, converted from Buddhism to Islam after the monastery's conquest and became powerful viziers under the Abbassid caliphs of Baghdad. The last of the family's line of viziers, Ja'far ibn Yahya, is a protagonist in many tales from the Arabian Nights. In folktales and popular culture Ja'far has been associated with a knowledge of mysticism, sorcery, and traditions lying outside the realm of Islam. The Buddhist religion survived the Islamic conquest of Afghanistan by the Umayyads and rule by the Abbasid Caliphate. Buddhism in Afghanistan was effectively removed by the Saffarids, Ghaznavids, and Ghurids. ==Archaeological finds== Manuscript fragment of the Buddhist Jatakamala, Sanskrit, language in the Gilgit-Bamiyan-Type II Protosarada script, Toyuk, probably 8th-9th century - Ethnological Museum, Berlin. ===Bamiyan monastery library=== One of the early Buddhist schools, the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika-LokottaravƒÅda, were known to be prominent in the area of Bamiyan. The Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang visited a LokottaravƒÅda monastery in the 7th century CE, at Bamiyan, Afghanistan, and this monastery site has since been rediscovered by archaeologists. Birchbark and palm leaf manuscripts of texts in this monastery's collection, including MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras, have been discovered at the site, and these are now located in the Sch√∏yen Collection. Some manuscripts are in the GƒÅndhƒÅrƒ´ language and Kharo·π£·π≠hƒ´ script, while others are in Sanskrit and written in forms of the Gupta script.

The title is a satirical reference to the 1980 film Can't Stop the Music, in which the Village People star. Eck and Saleh play two police constables in a rural village, 'Gary' and 'Akmal' who lead fairly unremarkable lives. Gary's main aim is to be crowned line dancing champion of the village, having always been the runner-up. However, a series of horrific murders, involving the mutilation of bodies, rock the town, and 'Tony' (Mir), a detective from the city, is called in reluctantly to investigate. Whilst the young Akmal is in awe of the dashing detective, Tony's aggressive methods clash with the uptight Gary, and 'Chief Carter' (Richard Carter), the officer in charge of the station. Tony is eventually sent back to the city, after shooting a French male stripper. Gary and Akmal soon discover that the murders have a Village People theme, with those murdered having been in one of the occupations of a Village Person, or resembling one. They fearfully deduce that either a policeman or a dentist (Akmal is uncertain, as he doesn't clearly remember the Village People, although Gary quickly deduces that it is, in fact, a policeman) will be next to die, as does Tony, who rushes back from the city. ==Production== The film stars a number of Australian stand-up comedians including Jimeoin, Bob Franklin, The Umbilical Brothers, Kitty Flanagan, Garry Who, Haskel Daniel, Richard Carter, The Dickster, Rash Ryder, Kenny Graham and Sandman. ==Box office== You Can't Stop the Murders grossed $254,871 at the box office in Australia.Film Victoria - Australian Films at the Australian Box Office ==See also== *Cinema of Australia ==ReferencesYou Cant Stop The Murders at the National Film and Sound Archive Category:2003 films Category:2000s crime comedy films Category:2000s comedy thriller films Category:Australian films Category:Australian comedy films Category:Cultural depictions of the Village People Category:Films about murder Category:Films set in Australia Category:Films shot in Australia Category:2003 comedy films ","title":"You Can't Stop the Murders"},{"id":"3254059","text":"The South Island Party is the name of two unrelated political parties from New Zealand: *The NZ South Island Party stood in the 1999 General Election *The South Island Party (2008) stood in the 2008 General Election ","title":"South Island Party"},{"id":"3254061","text":"Grant Thomas (born 1941) is a New Zealand politician.

In the 1990 election Thomas stood for the National Party, taking the Hamilton West electorate from Trevor Mallard. However he lost it to Labour's Martin Gallagher in the 1993 election. Thomas was a Hamilton city councillor from 1995 to 2007, when he stood down. Thomas served under five mayors during his twelve years of office in the council. In 2003 a comment about then-mayor David Braithwaite being a dictator prompted fellow councillor Bill Ward to question Thomas' support for the mayor. This led to Jody Garrett nominating Ward in a bid to replace Thomas as deputy mayor. The move ultimately failed, with ten councillors backing Thomas and only four supporting Ward. In 2005 Thomas claimed that the 13 members of the city council were excessive, saying \\"[their] salary is too high for the workload\\". By reducing the number to ten, Thomas explained that the council could save NZ$150,000 annually.

It is named after Dr. Sven Ivar Seldinger (1921‚Äì1998), a Swedish radiologist who introduced the procedure in 1953. ==Uses== The Seldinger technique is used for angiography, insertion of chest drains and central venous catheters, insertion of PEG tubes using the push technique, insertion of the leads for an artificial pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, and numerous other interventional medical procedures. ==Complications== The initial puncture is with a sharp instrument, and this may lead to hemorrhage or perforation of the organ in question. Infection is a possible complication, and hence asepsis is practiced during most Seldinger procedures. Loss of the guidewire into the cavity or blood vessel is a significant and generally preventable complication. ==Description== The desired vessel or cavity is punctured with a sharp hollow needle, with ultrasound guidance if necessary. A round-tipped guidewire is then advanced through the lumen of the needle, and the needle is withdrawn. A sheath or blunt cannula can now be passed over the guidewire into the cavity or vessel. Alternatively, drainage tubes are passed over the guidewire (as in chest drains or nephrostomies). After passing a sheath or tube, the guidewire is withdrawn. An introducer sheath can be used to introduce catheters or other devices to perform endoluminal (inside the hollow organ) procedures, such as angioplasty. Fluoroscopy may be used to confirm the position of the catheter and to manoeuvre it to the desired location. Injection of radiocontrast may be used to visualize organs. Interventional procedures, such as thermoablation, angioplasty, embolisation or biopsy, may be performed. Upon completion of the desired procedure, the sheath is withdrawn. In certain settings, a sealing device may be used to close the hole made by the procedure.

This had a high rate of complications. However, with the introduction of the Seldinger technique, angiography became a relatively risk-free procedure, and the field of interventional radiology blossomed. Building on the work of Seldinger, Charles Dotter and Andreas Gruentzig developed angioplasty. ==References== ==External links== * Flash animation of the Seldinger technique (FRCA.co.uk) * Category:Interventional radiology ","title":"Seldinger technique"},{"id":"3254068","text":"Chao Lake (), also known by its Chinese name Chao Hu, is a lake wholly situated in Hefei, the capital of Anhui Province. It is the largest in Anhui and one of the five largest freshwater lakes in China. ==Mythology== According to legend, the site of the lake was once a prosperous city named Chaozhou. Because of sins of its people, it was cursed by the heavens and ordered to be destroyed by flooding. The task was to be carried out by a white dragon who was only able to find one good person, an old lady ('Lao' in Chinese) surnamed Jiao. After the destruction of Chaozhou, only the old lady and her daughter were saved. They became the two islands emerging from the lake. This legend may be rooted in geological history, since Lake Chao is on the intersection of several major faults, of which the most famous is the Tan Lu Fault, which caused the great 1976 Tangshan earthquake in its northern section. ==Tourism== Noted tourist sites around the lake include Mushan Island, Zhongmiao Temple, Tongyang River, Mount Yinping, and the Immortals Cave. The silver fish, shrimps, and crabs of Lake Chao are called the Three Treasures. It enjoys the grand name of \\"Land of Plenty\\". ==Pollution and rehabilitation== About 5 million people live near the lake and use it for irrigation, transportation and fishing. Heavy use since the 1990s led to eutrophication and silting. Due to China's rapid economic growth, the lake became one of China's most polluted.

The video game was released for MS-DOS in 1994. It was ported to the PC-98 in 1995. Versions for Windows and Mac OS were also released in 1996 under the name of Alone in the Dark: Ghosts in Town.Alone in the Dark: Ghosts in Town ==Plot== It's 1925 and after Edward Carnby's success in his previous two investigations, a journalist has nicknamed him the 'Supernatural Private Eye'. This time, he is called to investigate the disappearance of a film crew at a two-bit ghost town known by the name of Slaughter Gulch located in the Mojave Desert in California. Among the disappeared crew is Emily Hartwood, Jeremy Hartwood's niece from the original. Edward soon discovers that a curse has gripped the town, and an evil cowboy from the Badlands named Jed Stone is the villain who is responsible for the crew's disappearance. Lurking around town are many trigger-happy sharpshooters, deranged prospectors, and bloodthirsty lost souls whom Edward must ward off with both his strength and his wit. ==Gameplay== The main theme of this game is the Wild West, as Carnby is pitted against a town filled with \\"zombie cowboy outlaws\\" who attack him with revolvers and lever-action rifles. More traditionally mindless, shambling zombies begin to appear about midway through the game. Towards the end of the game, the concept of radioactive mutation plays a significant role in the story, and the player ends up fighting monstrous creatures created from the radiation. ==Release== This was the first game in the series not to be released on floppy disks. Rather, it was released as a CD-ROM game since the initial release, with full Red Book audio soundtrack and dialogue speech (in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian and Japanese, depending on the country the game was released) like the CD-ROM re-releases of the previous two games. It was also the first game in the series to be exclusively released for several computer formats and therefore it didn't receive any official console release unlike the previous two games. Outside of Europe, the game was distributed in North America by Interplay Entertainment.

The concept refers to the empirical experience of the characteristics, or qualia, of different energy forms as they flow and transform. It appeals to our common perception of the heat value, versatility, and environmental performance of different energy forms and the way a small increment in energy flow can sometimes produce a large transformation effect on both energy physical state and energy. For example the transition from a solid state to liquid may only involve a very small addition of energy. Methods of evaluating energy quality are sometimes concerned with developing a system of ranking energy qualities in hierarchical order. ==Introduction== Since before antiquity there has been deep philosophical, aesthetic and scientific interest in the contrast of quality with quantity. In some respects the history of modern and postmodern thought can be characterized by the phenomenological approach to these two concepts. A central question has been whether the many different qualitative aspects of the world can be understood in terms of rational quantities, or whether the qualitative and quantitative are irreconcilable: that is, there is no \\"rational quality\\", or quale ratio. Many scientists and analytic philosophers say they are not, and therefore consider some qualitative phenomena like, for instance, spirituality, and astrology to be unquantifiable, unanalysable by scientific methods, and therefore ungrounded in physical reality. The notion of energy quality therefore has a tendency to be linked with phenomena many scientists consider unquantifiable, or at least incommunicable, and are consequently dismissed out of hand. At the same time many people have also recognised qualitative differences in the way things can be done by different entities (both physical and biological). Humans, for example have qualitatively different capacities than many other mammals, due, in part, to their opposable thumb. In the attempt to formalise some of the qualitative differences, entities were grouped according to distinguishing features or capacities. Different schools of thought used different methods to make distinctions. Some people chose taxonomic and genome structure, while others chose energetic function as the basis of classifications. The former are often associated with biology, while the latter with the trophic food chain analysis of ecology. These can be considered attempts to formalise quantitative, scientific studies of the qualitative differences between entities. The efforts were not isolated to biology and ecology, since engineers were also interested in quantifying the amount of work that qualitatively different sources of energy could provide. ==Ohta== According to Ohta (1994, pp. 90‚Äì91) the ranking and scientific analysis of energy quality was first proposed in 1851 by William Thomson under the concept of \\"availability\\". This concept was continued in Germany by Z. Rant, who developed it under the title, \\"die Exergie\\" (the exergy). It was later continued and standardised in Japan. Exergy analysis now forms a common part of many industrial and ecological energy analyses. For example, I.Dincer and Y.A. Cengel (2001, p. 132) state that energy forms of different qualities are now commonly dealt with in steam power engineering industry. Here the \\"quality index\\" is the relation of exergy to the energy content (Ibid.). However energy engineers were aware that the notion of heat quality involved the notion of value ‚Äì for example A. Thumann wrote, \\"The essential quality of heat is not the amount but rather its 'value'\\" (1984, p. 113) ‚Äì which brings into play the question of teleology and wider, or ecological-scale goal functions. In an ecological context S.E. Jorgensen and G.Bendoricchio say that exergy is used as a goal function in ecological models, and expresses energy \\"with a built-in measure of quality like energy\\" (2001, p. 392). ==Energy quality evaluation methods== There appear to be two main kinds of methodology used for the calculation of energy quality. These can be classed as either receiver or donor methods. One of the main differences that distinguishes these classes is the assumption of whether energy quality can be upgraded in an energy transformation process. Receiver methods: view energy quality as a measure and indicator of the relative ease with which energy converts from one form to another. That is, how much energy is received from a transformation or transfer process. For example, A. Grubler used two types of indicators of energetic quality pars pro toto: the hydrogen/carbon (H/C) ratio, and its inverse, the carbon intensity of energy. Grubler used the latter as an indicator of relative environmental quality. However Ohta says that in multistage industrial conversion systems, such as a hydrogen production system using solar energy, the energy quality is not upgraded (1994, p. 125). Donor methods: view energy quality as a measure of the amount of energy used in an energy transformation, and that goes into sustaining a product or service (H.T.Odum 1975, p. 3). That is how much energy is donated to an energy transformation process. These methods are used in ecological physical chemistry, and ecosystem evaluation. From this view, in contrast with that outlined by Ohta, energy quality is upgraded in the multistage trophic conversions of ecological systems. Here, upgraded energy quality has a greater capacity to feedback and control lower grades of energy quality. Donor methods attempt to understand the usefulness of an energetic process by quantifying the extent to which higher quality energy controls lower quality energy. ==Energy quality in physical-chemical science (direct energy transformations) == ===Constant energy form but variable energy flow=== T.Ohta suggested that the concept of energy quality may be more intuitive if one considers examples where the form of energy remains constant but the amount of energy flowing, or transferred is varied. For instance if we consider only the inertial form of energy, then the energy quality of a moving body is higher when it moves with a greater velocity. If we consider only the heat form of energy, then a higher temperature has higher quality. And if we consider only the light form of energy then light with higher frequency has greater quality (Ohta 1994, p. 90). All these differences in energy quality are therefore easily measured with the appropriate scientific instrument. ===Variable energy form, but constant energy flow=== The situation becomes more complex when the form of energy does not remain constant. In this context Ohta formulated the question of energy quality in terms of the conversion of energy of one form into another, that is the transformation of energy. Here, energy quality is defined by the relative ease with which the energy transforms, from form to form. > If energy A is relatively easier to convert to energy B but energy B is > relatively harder to convert to energy A, then the quality of energy A is > defined as being higher than that of B. The ranking of energy quality is > also defined in a similar way. (T.Ohta 1994, p. 90). Nomenclature: Prior to Ohta's definition above, A.W.Culp produced an energy conversion table describing the different conversions from one energy to another. Culp's treatment made use of a subscript to indicate which energy form is being talked about. Therefore, instead of writing \\"energy A\\", like Ohta above, Culp referred to \\"Je\\", to specify electrical form of energy, where\\" J\\" refers to \\"energy\\", and the \\"e\\"subscript refers to electrical form of energy. Culps notation anticipated Scienceman's (1997) later maxim that all energy should be specified as form energy with the appropriate subscript. ==Energy quality in biophysical economics (indirect energy transformations)== The notion of energy quality was also recognised in the economic sciences. In the context of biophysical economics energy quality was measured by the amount of economic output generated per unit of energy input (C.J. Cleveland et al. 2000). The estimation of energy quality in an economic context is also associated with embodied energy methodologies. Another example of the economic relevance of the energy quality concept is given by Brian Fleay. Fleay says that the \\"Energy Profit Ratio (EPR) is one measure of energy quality and a pivotal index for assessing the economic performance of fuels. Both the direct and indirect energy inputs embodied in goods and services must be included in the denominator.\\" (2006; p. 10) Fley calculates the EPR as the energy output/energy input. { cellpadding=\\"20\\" align=\\"right\\" -  { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"right\\" + DIFFERENT HIERARCHICAL RANKS OF ENERGY FORM QUALITY -  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:\\"dark red\\" align=\\"center\\"  HIGHEST QUALITY -  efefef;\\"  Ohta Ranking  style=\\"2\\" ffdead;\\"  Odum Ranking -  Electromagnetic  Information -  Mechanical  Human Services -  Photon  Protein Food -  Chemical  Electric Power -  Heat  Food, Greens, Grains -   River-water potential -   Consolidated Fuels -   River Chemical energy -   Mechanical -   Tide -   Gross Photosynthesis -   Average wind -   Sunlight -  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:\\"yellow\\" align=\\"center\\"  LOWEST QUALITY - } } ==Ranking energy quality== ===Energy abundance and relative transformation ease as measure of hierarchical rank and/or hierarchical position=== Ohta sought to order energy form conversions according to their quality and introduced a hierarchical scale for ranking energy quality based on the relative ease of energy conversion (see table to right after Ohta, p. 90). It is evident that Ohta did not analyse all forms of energy. For example, water is left out of his evaluation. It is important to note that the ranking of energy quality is not determined solely with reference to the efficiency of the energy conversion. This is to say that the evaluation of \\"relative ease\\" of an energy conversion is only partly dependent on transformation efficiency. As Ohta wrote, \\"the turbine generator and the electric motor have nearly the same efficiency, therefore we cannot say which has the higher quality\\" (1994, p. 90). Ohta therefore also included, 'abundance in nature' as another criterion for the determination energy quality rank. For example, Ohta said that, \\"the only electrical energy which exists in natural circumstances is lightning, while many mechanical energies exist.\\" (Ibid.). (See also table 1. in Wall's article for another example ranking of energy quality). ===Transformity as an energy measure of hierarchical rank=== Like Ohta, H.T.Odum also sought to order energy form conversions according to their quality, however his hierarchical scale for ranking was based on extending ecological system food chain concepts to thermodynamics rather than simply relative ease of transformation . For H.T.Odum energy quality rank is based on the amount of energy of one form required to generate a unit of another energy form. The ratio of one energy form input to a different energy form output was what H.T.Odum and colleagues called transformity: \\"the EMERGY per unit energy in units of emjoules per joule\\" (H.T.Odum 1988, p. 1135). ==See also== * EKOenergy ecolabel for energy * Green energy * Eugene Green Energy Standard * ISO 14001 * Monism * Emergy * Renewable energy * Renewable energy development * Transformity * Energetics * Energy accounting * Energy economics * Pirsig's metaphysics of Quality ==References== * M.T.

It consists of a garden, the tall Singing Tower with its carillon bells, Pine Ridge Trail, Pinewood Estate, and a visitor center. The tower is built upon Iron Mountain, one of the highest points of peninsular Florida, estimated to be above sea level. It is a National Historic Landmark that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, nationally significant for its association with Edward W. Bok and its designers. Bok Tower Gardens is open daily and an admission fee is charged. ==History== The gardens began in 1921 when a Dutch immigrant, Edward W. Bok, editor of the popular women's magazine Ladies Home Journal and his wife, Mary Louise Curtis Bok, who would found the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia in 1924, were spending the winter beside Florida's Lake Wales Ridge and decided to create a bird sanctuary on its highest hill, 295 feet (90 meters) above sea level. Bok commissioned noted landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. to transform what then was an arid sandhill into \\"a spot of beauty second to none in the country\\". The first year was spent digging trenches and laying pipes for irrigation, after which soil was brought to the site by thousands of truck loads and plantings began. The Olmsted plan included the planting of 1,000 large live oaks, 10,000 azaleas, 100 sabal palms, 300 magnolias, and 500 gordonias, as well as hundreds of fruit shrubs such as blueberry and holly. Where Edward Bok is Happiest: In His Garden Attempts were made to introduce flamingos to the sanctuary several times, which is why early renderings of the tower show flamingos at the reflection pool rather than swans. These early efforts were unsuccessful, however, as the flamingos were not native to central Florida and could not survive the winters that were cooler than those of southern Florida, where they may be found. Under construction for over five years, Bok Tower Gardens was dedicated by President Calvin Coolidge on February 1, 1929. Edward Bok died on January 9, 1930 and was interred at the base of the tower. ==Gardens== Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. designed the meandering gardens of Bok Tower Gardens to feature acres of ferns, palms, oaks, pines, and wetland plants. The plantings also include camellias, tree ferns, creeping fig, yaupon and dahoon holly, Asiatic jasmine, Justicia, crinum and spider lily, monstera, wax myrtle, date and sabal palm, papyrus, philodendron, blue plumbago, and horsetail rush. The site is a refuge for more than a hundred bird species. Wild turkey and groups of sandhill cranes are also often seen wandering the grounds. ==Singing Tower== The ornate brass door leading into Bok Tower and details of its stonework The Singing Tower is the centerpiece of the gardens. The tower was built at the highest elevation of the site, south of a reflection pool that allows the water to reflect its full image. A 60-bell carillon (cast by Taylor) set within the tall, Gothic Revival and Art Deco tower that was designed by architect Milton B. Medary. Construction on the tower began in 1927 and was completed for the dedication of the gardens in 1929, when it was dedicated by President Calvin Coolidge. The tower is square at its base, changing form at high to an octagon with sides that include sculptures designed by Lee Lawrie. The tower is surrounded by a moat that serves as a koi pond. It is built of pink Etowah marble and gray Creole marble, mined in Tate, Georgia, and coquina stone from St. Augustine, Florida. Although the tower's interior is not open to the public, it contains the Anton Brees Carillon Library, said to be the largest carillon library in the world. It also is home to the Chao Research Center Archives, which keeps various institutional records related to Bok Tower. Inside the bell chamber is a playing room that houses a clavier, or keyboard, that is used for playing the carillon bells. Recitals are given daily from the 60-bell carillon set. ==Library and Archives== Bok Tower Gardens currently houses a substantial amount of collections that document the history and growth of the Singing tower, the Gardens, and Pinewood Estate. While many of the collections are closed to the public for viewing, some selections from the archives about the history of the Gardens, Singing Tower, and Edward Bok are on display in the Visitor Center. ===Anton Brees Carillon Library=== The Anton Brees Carillon Library was established in 1968 after the death of Anton Brees, the beloved first carillonneur of the Singing Tower. The library is located on the fifth floor of the Singing Tower. It is often considered to be one of the largest collections of carillon-related materials in the world. The Anton Brees Carillon Library includes over 1500 books, 200 collections of scores for keyboard instruments, 3000 scores and musical compositions for carillon, 1600 audio and video recordings, and 15 international professional journals that include more than 900 individual volumes. The library also houses vertical files on international carillons that include newspaper clippings, biographical information and concert programs along with the original blueprints and plans for the Singing Tower and Gardens and thousands of photographs and slides. There are several important collections located in the Anton Brees Carillon Library, including the Guild of Carillonneurs in North America Archives, Ronald Barnes Collection, Anton Brees Collection, Sidney Giles Collection and Arthur Bigelow Collection. Access to the collections in the Anton Brees Carillon Library is available by appointment only. To make an appointment, the Bok Tower librarian should be contacted. ===Chao Research Center Archives=== The Chao Research Center Archives was formed in 2008, after a generous donation made by the Ting Tsung and Wei Fong Chao Foundation. With this donation, space was made available on the second floor of the Singing Tower to accommodate a growing need for delicate archival documents. The Chao Research Center Archives stores the official archives of Bok Tower Gardens along with other significant collections. These significant collections include the Nellie Lee Bok Collection, American Foundation Collection, and Edward Bok Newspaper Scrapbook Collection. The Nellie Lee Bok Collection includes her personal communications, photographs, manuscript writings, and family possessions. The American Foundation Collection includes newspaper scrapbooks, meeting minutes, publications, and other manuscript materials. The Edward Bok Newspaper Scrapbook Collection is made up of 42 bound scrapbooks filled with newspaper clippings about Bok's publications and charitable acts. Access to the collections in the Chao Research Center Archives is available by appointment only. To make an appointment the Bok Tower Librarian should be contacted. ===Pinewood Estate Collections=== The Pinewood Estate Mansion holds furniture, ceramics and other objects that were kept in the house before Bok Tower purchased it in 1970. Other collections held at Pinewood Estate include letters, promotional materials, and manuscripts. Pinewood Estate is open to the public throughout most of the year at a small fee. To explore the Pinewood Estate Collections an appointment must be set with the Pinewood Estate coordinator in advance. ==Pine Ridge Trail== The Pine Ridge Nature Preserve and Trail is an ecosystem typified by an over-story of Longleaf Pine, sandhill habitats, and a dense ground cover of perennial grasses that includes a nature trail that begins at the Window by the Pond and extends for three-quarters of a mile ending at the Visitor Center. The trail is located on one of the highest points in peninsular Florida at 298 feet above sea level. Long ago the Ridge was a chain of islands. The plants and animals found on the Ridge are unique because they evolved on the chain of islands, which is why the most rare plants and animals can be found in this area. The Pine Ridge is home to several endangered animals including the gopher tortoise, eastern indigo snake, gopher frogs, and the Florida mouse. Conservation efforts for the pine trail by Bok Tower include restoration of native plants, the regulation of invasive species and educating the public. ==Pinewood Estate== of the Gardens include the Pinewood Estate, which features a twenty-room Mediterranean Revival mansion. This mansion was built between 1930-1932 by C. Austin Buck, vice-president of Bethlehem Steel Co. in Pennsylvania, as a winter residence. Its original name was \\"El Retiro\\", and it has been restored to its 1930s appearance. The sanctuary features several events at this mansion during the year. Guided tours of the 20-room Mediterranean-style mansion are given daily. ==Exhibit Hall and Museum== Historical perspective on the life of Edward W. Bok and the story of the creation of the garden. ==Education== All of the Education Department's programs and field trips align with the Florida Sunshine State Standards and Polk County Curriculum Maps. The lessons presented in the Education Department's curriculum guide cover academic areas such as science, nature, visual & performance arts, culture and history. The curriculum guide was created to help students explore and discover Bok Tower Gardens before, during and after their trip. Students are able to learn detailed information about the gardens, the singing tower, Pinewood Estate and the Visitor Center that is contained within the curriculum guide. ==Events== Throughout the year, there are numerous events designed to draw visitors to the Gardens. These events include concerts featuring jazz, orchestras, and the carillon bells of the Tower. The most popular are the semi-annual symphony concerts, given in the evening once in the fall and once in the spring. These events draw thousands of visitors to the large field in front of the Tower for an outdoor picnic. They feature music from both the symphony orchestra and carillon bells. ==Gallery== File:Bok_Tower_rear.JPGRear side of tower File:Bok Tower mosaic glazing details.jpgDetail of glazed ceramic mosaics File:Bok_Tower_view.JPGDistant orange groves seen from atop site of Bok Tower (Iron Mountain summit) File:Singing Tower sundial at Bok Tower Gardens 001.jpgSundial on the Singing Tower ==See also== *List of botanical gardens in the United States *Camp Mack's River Resort *Legoland Florida ==References== ==External links== * *Polk County listings at Florida's Office of Cultural and Historical Programs *Overview of Bok Tower Gardens *National Park Service National Historic Landmark Category:Botanical gardens in Florida Category:Carillon towers in the United States Category:Historic house museums in Florida Category:Lake Wales, Florida Category:Museums in Polk County, Florida Category:National Historic Landmarks in Florida Category:National Register of Historic Places in Polk County, Florida Category:Parks in Polk County, Florida Category:Towers in Florida Category:1929 establishments in Florida ","title":"Bok Tower Gardens"},{"id":"3254158","text":"300px The United States Navy master diver is the highest warfare qualification obtainable by a member of U.S. Navy diving community.

In 2016, it moved to Sydney Olympic Park, and found its new home at Qudos Bank Arena. The Schools Spectacular was broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation from 1984 until 2012, then by the Nine Network from 2013 until 2015. The Seven Network has been broadcasting the Schools Spectacular since 2016. Fifteen television cameras are placed in various vantage points throughout the arena. All four performances are recorded, and the best versions of each show segment are edited together and then aired in the television broadcast two weeks after the live event. The actual performance is made up of many different pieces. A typical piece would have a spotlighted soloist singing on an elevated platform in the arena, surrounded by many dancers and actors. On the stage, the orchestra would be playing the instrumental part of the song while the choirs behind and next to the orchestra would be singing the chorus of the song. There are some 400 audio inputs for microphones and musical instruments, and an amazing array of around 600 lights used throughout the show. The first Schools Spectacular was Schools Spectacular 1983 and was intended to be a sound test for the Sydney Entertainment Centre. Since then, the Schools Spectacular has evolved significantly. The 2012 event included 3,600 students and 600 teachers from 400 schools in four performances viewed by 30,000 people. Schools Spectacular 2016 broke the Guinness World Record for \\"Largest Amateur Variety Act\\", with 5,500 performers. As well as being broadcast each year on national television, the Schools Spectacular is webcast through the Internet onto their website, with the help and sponsorship by Cisco Systems. The Schools Spectacular is produced by 'The Arts Unit' of the New South Wales Department of Education. ==Themes By Year== Each year the Schools Spectacular follows a theme; *1993 - One Spirit *1994 - International *1995 - Hats Off To Australia *1996 - Get Set 2000 *1997 - The Edge *1998 - Reaching the World *1999 - To Be Australian *2000 - The Entertainers *2001 - Celebrate! *2002 - By Invitation *2003 - 20 Years on *2004 - 21st Birthday *2005 - The Face of Australia *2006 - Shine *2007 - My Spec *2008 - The Spectacular Spirit *2009 - Reaching Out *2010 - Colour My World *2011 - Imagine *2012 - Our Time *2013 - 30 Spectacular Years *2014 - This Is Australia *2015 - This is Our World *2016 - Dream Big *2017 - Own The Moment *2018 - The Greatest *2019 - Stars *2020 - (show cancelled) === Schools Spectacular 2020 === On 24 March, 2020, the official Schools Spectacular website announced that the 2020 Schools Spectacular would not go ahead due to the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

It is located in Plovdiv Province, close to the towns Sadovo and Chirpan. The word literally means First of May, i.e., May Day, in English and is sometimes transliterated as Parvomai or Purvomai. As with many places in Bulgaria, the town has other names, such as its old name (up until 1947) of Borisovgrad (after Bulgaria's last Tsar, Boris to celebrate his birthday on 30 January 1894), as well as Borisovgrad, Borissograd, Borissovgrade, or Borissowgrad. Until 1894, it was known by its Turkish names of Hadzi Ejles (Bulgarian –•–∞–¥–∂–∏ –ï–ª–µ—Å), Hadzi-Ele, Hadzi-Jeiles, Khadzhi Eiles, or Khadzhi-Eles (\\"Hacƒ± ƒ∞lyas\\" in Turkish). ==The Town== The municipal centre town Parvomay is situated at 134 meters above sea level, with geographic coordinates 25–æ13\`30\`\` East longitude and 42–æ06\`00\`\` North latitude. The town is 180 km to the east of Sofia, 39 km to the east of Plovdiv city, 50 km to the southwest of Stara Zagora, 34 km to the west of city of Haskovo and 360 km to the northwest of Istanbul, the northern edge of the town is 700m south of the Maritza River. The topography of the Parvomay Municipality is predominantly a flat plain with the exception being the fields of the Voden and Bukovo villages and the rolling hills around Iskra, Bryagovo, Dragoinovo and Ezerovo which are from the foothills of Dragoyna. The name of the ridge comes from a legend about Dragoy, prince of the Slavonic tribe that inhabited the region and his daughter Dragoyna, who built a white stone castle on the peak but the Byzantines conquered and destroyed her residence. This range is in turn the foothills of the Rhodopi mountains, passing to the South- West into the Novakovski Balkan mountain. In 1926, the population of the town was 4425 people, and in 1946 the town was 5050, by 1985 the population had risen to 17,136, by 1992 it had dropped to 16,826. The population of the town in 2009 was 16,630, by the end of 2010 it had fallen to 13,733. The settlement ranks the 57th largest cities of Bulgaria. Map of Parvomay municipality (Plovdiv Province) ==The Municipality== The Parvomay Municipality has its administrative centre in the town of Parvomay. The town is formed of three areas, Parvomay in the centre, Debar to the South and Liybenovo to the North east. The municipality is situated in the most Eastern area of the Plovdiv Pazadjik plain‚Äì part of the Upper Thracian lowlands, with total area of 470,057 decares. The Municipality encompasses 17 settlements with population of 32,131 people. Villages in Parvomay Municipality in the Plovdiv Province are; Bryagovo (789 inhabitants to 02/05/2006), Bukovo, Byala Reka, Dalbok Izvor, Dobri Do, Dragoynovo, Ezerovo, Gradina, Iskra, Karadjalovo. Iskra being the largest in the area with a population of 1829 (to 02/05/2006) in the Dragoyna foothills to the south of Parvomay. ==History== Fossils of sea shells have been found in the limestone rocks near the village of Ezerovo (to the south east of Parvomay town) a full skeleton of a prehistoric Deinotherium was also found in this area which is on display in Asenovgrad Paleontological Museum. Sometime from the 5th century BC to the 3rd century BC, this area became part of the Thracian Odrysian kingdom. In the quarters of Debar and Liybenovo on the outskirts of Parvomay town, archeologists have found Thracian mounds. By the 1st century AD, this part of Thrace was annexed by the Roman empire, and later it remained a part of its Eastern Roman Empire. Roman graves dating to the period of the 1st‚Äì4th centuries have been also discovered around Parvomay. Through the history of Bulgaria the area has been Thracian, Greek, Roman, Byzantium, Slav, Bulgar and Ottoman. There were archaeological finds in 2004 2005 and 2006 relating to a Thracian cult complex of a collection of tribes known as the Odrysian kingdom in an area to the south of Dragoynovo at the Goliama Dragoyna peak. The peak of Goliama Dragoyna is the highest point in the area at 813,60 m. The sub region of Dragoyna is believed to have been a local centre of the Thracian aristocracy within the Odryssian kingdom, possibly linked to Perperikon. A high concentration of Thracian tumulus (burial mounds) have been found in the area. A well known golden ring was found in Ezerovo,Comparative Indo-European Linguistics: An Introduction by Robert S. P. Beekes,1995,Back matter,\\"... Thracian ‚Äì The gold ring with inscription from Ezerovo, ...\\" near to Dragoyna archaeological site. The ring has an inscriptionThe Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 1: The Prehistory of the Balkans, the Middle East and the Aegean World, Tenth to Eighth Centuries BC by John Boardman, I. E. S. Edwards, N. G. L. Hammond, and E. Sollberger, 1982, page 878 in Thracian Language with Greek letters. It indicates that the relatives dedicate the ring to the deceased. Also found were numerous dice that resemble the modern dice used for playing. Playing dice has an ancient history and it seems that the inhabitants of Thrace were well acquainted with the game. A settlement, most probably related with the sanctuary, was located close to the village of Dragoynovo near to Iskra. This religious complex is one of the many sacred places, established by the Thracians on high mountain peaks. Sanctuaries of this type originated and developed as religious centres in the period between the Late Bronze Age and the end of the Roman Empire. The sanctuary complex on Dragoyna peak was first studied and recorded in the first half of the 20th century since when the site has suffered at the hands of numerous treasure hunters. No formal archaeological excavations were conducted until 2004. Two periods of occupation have been identified from the archaeological evidence: *13th century BC ‚Äì 5th century BC: the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age, but also the Dark Ages in the Aegean and Anatolia. At this time, the hill had no floral and soil cover. The archaeological finds from the period are fireplaces, which served as altars for various fire-related rituals. *4th century BC ‚Äì 3rd century BC: the Late Iron Age or the period of Classics and Hellenism. In this period, the region of the Eastern Mediterranean had its cultural consolidation provoked by the military campaigns of the Macedonian rulers Philip II and Alexander the Great. This was also the period of the most active utilization of the sanctuary. In recent years archaeological excavations near village of Iskra four churches were discovered, this has increased speculation about the existence of a sizable religious centre. 1928 Chirpan earthquake ‚Äì Voyvodinovo The oldest documented reference to the city Parvomay of 1576 it is in the register of Ottoman Taxes in Bulgaria. In 1671 the famous Turkish travel writer Evliya Celebi mentions Village Iskra to the South. Parvomay was for a time part of Eastern Rumelia an autonomous province within the Ottoman Empire after the Treaty of Berlin in 1878. After the revolution of September 6, 1885, the province was annexed by the Principality of Bulgaria. On 14 April 1928, a sequence of two earthquakes of a magnitude of approx 7 hit central Bulgaria which resulted in 74,000 buildings being destroyed and 114 people were killed in the nearby city of Plovdiv, Chirpan (to the north) and Parvomay. A newspaper at the time reported 1000 buildings in Parvomay as collapsed. ==Civic and educational buildings== Just after the opening of the Post Office in 1881, in 1882, the first hospital in Parvomay opened with one doctor and 10 hospital beds, and in 1886 the first doctors clinic. Today, Parvomay hospital is located just to the southwest of the town centre and a sizable medical centre just to the north of the centre. Parvomay Theatre (also the St. Cyril and Methodius Community Center) is located in parkland in the centre of the Town. Following the 1928 that destroyed many buildings including the Court House, a fund was set up to construct a new building. Justice Kachakova Jordan, who was born in Byala Reka, near Parvomay assisting in the fund raising. The small but impressive building was constructed in the centre of Parvomay in 1932 and has jurisdiction for the whole of the Parvomay Municipality. Court House Parvomay built 1932 Parvomay Theatre & St. Cyril and Methodius Georgi Karaslavov School, Parvomay Parvomay town has two secondary schools ‚Äì the School of Professional (economy, ecology, machinery) agriculture called \\"Vasil Levski\\" to the northeast of the centre, on Bratya Miladinovi street and \\"School Prof. Dr. Zlatarov \\" on Kocho Chestimenski street to the west of the town centre.

The Village of Bryagovo has \\"Razvitie\\" Community Center and the Village of Dragoynovo \\"Petar Delchev Orlovski\\" Community Center. ==Transport and Infrastructure== In addition to the water and electrical infrastructure, in 1994 Bulgaria began the gasification of the country. The city of Parvomay had the honour of having the first cubic meter of natural gas sold. There are limited charter flights to the nearby Plovdiv International Airport just to the east of the Plovdiv Asenovgrad highway (12 km SE of Plovdiv). There has been considerable investment in this airport by the Bulgarian government and local municipalities. In 2010, scheduled flights began to London and Moscow in 2011 routes were expanded to Frankfurt. The international European road –ï-80 passes through the southern edge of the town and a branch of the Trakia highway (A1) passes very near on the way to Burgas. The section branching off currently (2010) under construction to the Southeast towards Turkey known as the Maritza motorway A3. The Maritza motorway designated A3, which will branches off from east of Plovdiv just west of Chirpan at the Orizovo Interchange and 5 km north of Parvomay, at the Orizovo Interchange runs south east to the Turkish border. As of Summer 2015 all sections are in operation to the Turkish border other than a small section around Chirpan. In Parvomay town in 2011, two new road bridges over the railway line were opened forming part of a southern and northern ring road of the town. The railway line from Belovo to Dimitrovgrad, runs through Parvomay officially opened in 1873. Parvomay Station during renovations 200 The municipal territory is crossed by a high- speed railway, first opened in 1873 now run by the Bulgarian State Railways part of the line from Sofia to Istanbul. The upgrading of the Plovdiv- Svilengrad line was the biggest local project financed by EU's ISPA program at a cost of 340 mln euro. The European Investment Bank has lent 150 mln euro to the venture with 153 mln euro coming from ISPA and 37 mln euro from Bulgaria's state budget. The doubling of 150 km of track from Plovdiv to Parvomay was completied in November 2009 with the renovation of Parvomay Railway Station and the closure of road level crossings in Parvomay Town were replaced by a road flyover in 2011. Although this train route is open, it will have a limited service until further sections being constructed are completed. At the end of 2012 a scheme was selected for a new underpass to access the railway station from the southern half of the town. ==Agriculture and environment== The Maritsa river runs to the East through the Municipality with the Mechka, Byala and Kayaliyka rivers running North into the Maritsa with thermal mineral springs in Dragoinovo, Byala Reka and Lenovo.

He helped to develop a lively intellectual film culture in Britain during the interwar years, and was also the founder of the International Table Tennis Federation. ==Life and career== Montagu was born into enormous wealth, as the third son of Gladys Helen Rachel Goldsmid and Louis Montagu, 2nd Baron Swaythling, a Jewish banking dynasty with a mansion in Kensington. He attended Westminster School and King's College, Cambridge, where he contributed to Granta. He became involved in zoological research. With Sidney Bernstein he established the London Film Society in 1925, the first British film association devoted to showing art films and independent films. Montagu became the first film critic of The Observer and the New Statesman. He did the post- production work on Alfred Hitchcock's The Lodger in 1926 and was hired by Gaumont-British in the 1930s, working as a producer on a number of the Hitchcock thrillers. His 1928 silent slapstick movie Bluebottles (slang for police) is included in the British Film Institute's History of the Avant-Garde ‚Äì Britain in the Twenties. The story was by H. G. Wells, and the stars of the film were Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester, while the remaining cast were his friends including Norman Haire (also Montagu's doctor), Sergei Nolbandov and Joe Beckett. Montagu joined the Fabian Society in his youth, then the British Socialist Party, and then the Communist Party of Great Britain. This brought him into contact with the brilliant Russian film makers who were transforming the language of editing and montage in the 1920s. In 1930 he accompanied his friend Sergei Eisenstein to New York and Hollywood; later in the decade Montagu made a number of compilation films, including Defence of Madrid (1936) and Peace and Plenty (1939)British Film Institute: Peace and Plenty. Ivor Montagu, 1939. about the Spanish Civil War. He directed the documentary Wings Over Everest (1934) with Geoffrey Barkas. As a political figure and for a time a communist, much of his work at the time was on low budget, independent political films. By World War II, however, he made a film for the Ministry of Information. After the war Montagu worked as a film critic and reviewer. In 1933, Montagu was a founder member of the Association of Cinematograph and Television Technicians, holding various positions in the union until the 1960s. He also held post on the World Council of Peace. In 1934 he was founder of the Progressive Film Institute. Montagu had a keen interest in wildlife conservation, and was a council member of the Fauna Preservation Society for several years. He was friends with the eminent Soviet conservationist and zoologist Prof. . He had contacts in Mongolia, and was a champion for the conservation of the endangered Przewalski's horse. On 10 January 1927 he married Eileen Hellstern (1904-1984), the daughter of Francis Anton Hellstern, a boot maker from Camberwell. Although the couple did not have any children together, Ivor adopted Eileen's young daughter, Rowna Barnett n√©e Hellstern (1922-1996). ==Table tennis== Montagu was a champion table tennis player, representing Britain in matches all over the world. He also helped to establish and finance the first world championships in London in 1926. Montagu founded the International Table Tennis Federation that same year, and was president of the group for more than forty years, not retiring until 1967. He helped expel apartheid South Africa from the Federation during the 1950s.Brown and Hogsbjerg, Apartheid is not a game, 13 He also founded the English Table Tennis Association (ETTA), and served several terms as chairman and president. Montagu was inducted into the International Table Tennis Foundation Hall of Fame in 1995. ==Recruited by Soviet intelligence== His older brother Ewen Montagu, a barrister in civilian life, became a Naval Intelligence Officer RNVR in MI6, during the Second World War, privy to the secrets of top-secret Ultra and the mastermind of the successful deception that launched the invasion of Sicily, Operation Mincemeat. He later wrote a best-selling account of that adventure, The Man Who Never Was. Ivor Montagu himself turned out to be working, albeit briefly, for the other side. A 25 July 1940 cable from Simon Davidovitch Kremer, Secretary to the Soviet Military Attach√© in London, identified him as the somewhat reluctant new recruit who was supposed to create an \\"X Group\\" of like-minded friends.Records of the Government Code and Cypher School 15/43, British National Archives, Kew By the following year, Hitler had invaded Russia and the Soviet Union became an ally of Britain's, so that by June, 1941, both brothers were technically working for the same side. Ivor knew of his elder brother's spy work, but it seems doubtful his brother knew of his. Counter-espionage agents at MI5, however, even Ewen's boss John C. Masterman, seem to have suspected Ivor in general because of his outspoken Communist politics, his hanging around with scruffy Russians and housing a Jewish refugee in his house in the country. By far the greatest suspicions were aroused by Ivor's passionate support of international ping-pong, which seemed so eccentric to MI5 that they assumed it had to be a cover for something else. They even tapped his phone and opened his mail, creating three volumes on him by early 1942, but found nothing specific, much to Ewen's relief, since he was always worried that his own career in MI6 would be adversely affected by the activities of his left-wing brother.McIntrye, pp. 129-133 Only after the decryption in the 1960s of Venona telegraphs from March 1940 through April 1942 was he purportedly identified as \\"Ivor Montagu, the well known local communist, journalist and lecturer,\\" code name \\"Intelligentsia\\", in communications from the Soviet GRU. It should, however, be noted that the Verona decrypts, which were finally declassified in 1995, are a highly contested and confusing archive of information, with a welter of code-names, which were frequently changed and not explicitly identified with their real names; hence these decrypts were never used in any U.S. or British trials for treason, despite their availability to prosecutors from the late 1940s.\\"Cables Coming in From The Cold,\\" by Walter Schneir and Miriam Schneir, The Nation, July, 1999 http://www.thenation.com/article/cables-coming-cold/ If \\"Intelligentsia\\" was, indeed, Ivor Montagu, his rather haphazard informing had little of the impact of those much more famous Cambridge-educated spies, recruited as idealistic anti-Fascists in the 1930s, who continued to work at the height of the Cold War - Kim Philby, Guy Burgess and Donald MacLean. In 1952, MI5 intercepted a telegram from Ivor Montagu telling Charlie Chaplin how sorry he was to miss him in London when the star visited England that year; the British agency had agreed to spy on Charlie Chaplin for the FBI, who were looking for ways to keep him out of America at the height of McCarthyism. The Guardian, 17 February 2012. Retrieved 6 July 2013. Apart from that, they left Montagu and his ping pong tournaments alone. Montagu was awarded the prestigious Lenin Peace Prize in 1959, given by the Soviet government to a number of recipients whose work furthers the cause of Socialism, primarily outside of the USSR. ==Writing== Montagu wrote many pamphlets and books, such as Film World (1964), With Eisenstein in Hollywood (1968), and The Youngest Son (1970). He wrote two books about table tennis: Table Tennis Today (1924) and Table Tennis (1936). ==See also== *List of select Jewish table tennis players ==References== ==Further reading== *Montagu, Ivor (1975) \\"Old man's mumble: reflections on a semi-centenary\\" Sight and Sound; autumn 1975, pp. 220-224 & 247 (relates to the Film Society, found 1925) * * * Brown, Geoff and Hogsbjerg, Christian.

Nerolidol is present in neroli, ginger, jasmine, lavender, tea tree, Cannabis sativa, and lemon grass, and is a dominant scent compound in Brassavola nodosa. The aroma of nerolidol is woody and reminiscent of fresh bark. It is used as a flavoring agent and in perfumery and is used in non-cosmetic products such as detergents and cleansers.

From 1997 to 2011 its main shareholder was Julio Mario Santo Domingo. It is the oldest newspaper in Colombia. Since its first issue its motto has been \\"El Espectador will work for the good of the country with liberal criteria and for the good of the liberal principles with patriotic criteria\\". It was initially published twice a week, 500 issues each. It defined itself as a \\"political, literary, news and industrial newspaper\\". Years later it became a daily and in 2001 became a weekly. Since then, the paper uses the slogan \\"El Espectador. Opinion is news\\", implying it now focuses in opinion articles, not in breaking news.

It was closed by the authorities several times: * 8 July 1887, by the Rafael N√∫√±ez administration, 134 days after its first issue, until 10 January 1888. * 27 October 1888, by the then designated Carlos Holgu√≠n Sardi, until 12 February 1891; previously, the Catholic Church had forbidden its followers to read the newspaper, because of criticism of the lavishness of the Catholic Church in public celebrations made by its director. * On 26 September 1892 the government fined the newspaper with $200.000 after considering one of its articles \\"subversive\\". * 8 August 1893, by Antioquia governor Abraham Garc√≠a, until 14 March 1896. Fidel Cano Guti√©rrez was jailed. * On 27 June 1896, until 27 April 1897, due to a press law recently passed by the Congress. * The outbreak of the Thousand Days War made El Espectador suspend its activities between 19 October 1899 and 16 October 1903 * On 17 December 1904 it was suspended again, after facing difficulties and opposing the Rafael Reyes administration. It appeared again on 2 January 1913, as an evening daily in Medell√≠n. A Washington printing press where the first issue of El Espectador was printed in 1887, Museo Universitario, University of Antioquia, History Collection at San Ignacio Building, Medell√≠n, Colombia Since 10 February 1915 El Espectador has been simultaneously published in Medell√≠n and Bogot√°. Its Medell√≠n edition was suspended on 20 July 1923. In 1948, after the murder of Liberal Party leader Jorge Eliecer Gait√°n, its circulation was suspended for three days. Since then, El Espectador has had to deal with the censorship of the then ruling Conservative Party several times. On 9 November 1949, Luis Cano Villegas, its director, resigned in protest for the seizure of the entire edition by the government, being replaced by his brother Gabriel Cano Villegas. On 6 September 1952, its facilities, then located in downtown Bogot√°, as well as the building of competitor El Tiempo and the houses of Liberal Party leaders Eduardo Santos and Carlos Lleras Restrepo, were looted and partially destroyed, apparently with the tacit consent of the government. It reappeared on 16 September. In 1955 the newspaper, outspokenly opposed to the military government of Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, publishing several articles by Alberto Lleras Camargo, with a substantial effect on public opinion. In December, the government accused El Espectador of several accounting and tax irregularities, and fined the newspaper $10,000 on 20 December 1955. On 6 January 1956 the National Taxes Direction imposed on El Espectador a fine of $600,000. Its directors, who were forbidden to respond to the accusations against the paper, suspended its publication that day. A blackout at El Espectador facilities In order to replace El Espectador, on 20 February 1956 appeared El Independiente, directed by Alberto Lleras Camargo, who retired in April when the newspaper was closed for several months. It was published again in 1957 but due to an agreement by the opposition newspapers, it suspended its publication on 5 May. Five days later, Rojas Pinilla was ousted. El Independiente circulated until 31 May 1958. The next day, Jun 1, it was formally replaced by El Espectador. In 1964 its headquarters moved from downtown to western Bogot√°, on the avenida 68, the area becoming known as Avenida El Espectador. At the inauguration, its then director Gabriel Cano Villegas said: \\"if El Tiempo has the best corner in Bogot√°, El Espectador has the best corner in the country.\\" Throughout the 20th century El Espectador was the main Liberal newspaper, with El Tiempo, both holding an important political influence. Among its main contributors it had some of the most important Colombian journalists at the time, like Luis Eduardo Nieto Caballero, Alberto Lleras Camargo, Eduardo Zalamea Borda, Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, Eduardo Caballero Calder√≥n, Klim, Antonio Panesso Robledo, In√©s de Monta√±a, Alfonso Castillo G√≥mez, Jos√© Salgar, as well as cartoonists Hern√°n Merino, Pep√≥n, Consuelo Lago, and Osuna. ==Journalism of ideas== During the 20th century El Espectador criticized other mass media in Colombia, which preferred to remain silent instead of denouncing the atrocities happening in the country. In the early 1980s, the daily published several articles denouncing illegal loans and other irregularities allegedly performed by the Grupo Grancolombiano, one of the most powerful financial groups at the time. As retaliation, several big companies pulled their ads from the paper, which was already facing some financial issues. El Espectador disputed accusations made against it and dedicated an editorial piece to its credibility and the credibility of the financial groups. El Espectador also demanded in its editorials freedom of the press and denounced the political censorship the independent media outlets had to deal with to avoid being closed, stating that \\"not even in the worst times of press censorship or political retaliation, some resorted to crime in order to silence the press, in one of its more noble and higher democratic functions.\\" It recognized that in Colombia \\"the death penalty ordered and executed from the lowest social holes has become an habit, as a revenge against the work of social sanity the press is committed to.\\" It concluded saying that \\"the feeling of siege and danger ‚Äîon the press‚Äî would be negatively reflected on the whole democratic system.\\" The newspaper rejected being considered as \\"subversive opposition\\" and criticized Liberal president Julio C√©sar Turbay Ayala's government, which by its words wished to \\"have a totally loyal, extremely pro-government press, not silenced but flattering.\\" To defend itself, the paper published 15 July 1979 a column named Si eso es opposici√≥n... (\\"If that's opposition...\\") In the same text, the newspaper declared itself \\"neutral\\", considering that a democracy should not be polarized, \\"because in the times we are living, newspapers are increasingly more independent from governments, more devoted entirely to report and guide according to their honest knowledge and understanding,\\" adding that the \\"unanimous, one-way, uniformed, official press is (intended) for dictatorships and not for democracies... and we believe that Colombia is still a democracy.\\" El Espectador also criticized, openly, drug trafficking: ==Guillermo Cano's murder== As stated before, El Espectador stood firm against drug trafficking and often published articles on its crimes. On 17 December 1986, the then director of El Espectador, Guillermo Cano Isaza, was assassinated in front of the newspaper offices by gunmen paid by Pablo Escobar, after publishing several articles critical of Colombia's drug barons. Cano left the headquarters around 19:00 in his family station wagon. After he made a U-turn on the Avenida El Espectador, one of the hitmen approached the wagon Cano was driving, shot him in the chest four times, and then fled on a motorcycle identified with the licence plate FAX84. Cano was 61 years old, and had been a journalist for 44 years. His murder is still considered unpunished. The next day, El Espectador's main headline was Seguimos adelante (\\"We are going on\\"). The World Press Freedom Prize, awarded annually by UNESCO since 1997, is named in his honour, for \\"his courage, his compromise with independent journalism and the tenacity with which he fought for his country\\", which \\"are an example for the rest of the world to follow. Guillermo Cano's fate exemplifies the price paid by journalists the world over in exercising their profession; journalists are imprisoned and ill-treated every day and the fact that these crimes, for the most part, go unpunished is even more alarming.\\" On 2 September 1989 the paper's offices were bombed by the Medell√≠n Cartel. The blast occurred around 06:30; it blew the building's roof up, destroyed the main entry and affected the newspaper's production. The bomb was hidden in a van parked minutes before it exploded in front of the main entry. The same day, 6 armed men broke into an exclusive island in Islas del Rosario, near Cartagena de Indias, and set fire to the Cano family's summer house. ==Defence of the freedom of the press== On 29 May 2000 Reporters Without Borders issued a letter of protest to Interior Minister Humberto de La Calle Lombana, on the kidnapping of journalist Jineth Bedoya, at the time working for El Espectador, allegedly carried out by members of the paramilitary United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC). Robert M√©nard, RWB's secretary general, \\"stated that he was \\"scandalised\\" by this latest attack on Bedoya\\". She would later join El Tiempo. On 23 August 1999, a group called Colombian Rebel Army (ERC) published a communiqu√© issuing death threats against 21 personalities engaged in the then ongoing peace process, accusing them of \\"promoting war between Colombians\\". Among those personalities two El Espectador contributors were mentioned, Alfredo Molano y Arturo Alape. On 19 January 1999, Molano left the country (he would return years later). Molano had condemned the massacre of 130 people perpetrated weeks before by members of AUC commanded by Carlos Casta√±o, who had referred to Molano as \\"paraguerrilla\\". On 18 September, Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza, who had worked for El Espectador and RCN Radio, went into exile. Between February and May 2000, journalist Ignacio G√≥mez received at least 56 threatening letters. In an article published by El Espectador, G√≥mez had revealed that the Mapirip√°n Massacre, in which 49 peasants were killed by paramilitary militias, had been supported by members of the Colombian Army. After escaping a kidnapping attempt in Bogot√° on 24 May, G√≥mez sought refuge in the United States on 1 June 2000. He would return to Colombia one year later and become part of Noticias Uno TV newscast. On 21 March 2003 columnist Fernando Garavito left Colombia for the United States, after several death threats. He denounced human rights violations by AUC, as well as the alleged tolerance on drug barons in the past by the then presidential candidate √Ålvaro Uribe V√©lez. On 8 February 2003 photojournalist Herminso Ruiz was beaten and had his camera confiscated by members of the Colombian National Police while he was covering El Nogal club bombing. The incident was contempt by organizations as RWB. In May 2003 the newspaper, through an editorial written by its then director Ricardo Santamar√≠a, reported on \\"interference\\" on an investigation it was carrying on the alleged irregularities in Banco del Pac√≠fico, claiming that Police intelligence officials had obtained access to a draft of the report and sent it, through the Colombian National Police director, Teodoro Campo, to the then Interior Minister Fernando Londo√±o, who was a chairman of the bank. Organizations defending freedom of the press expressed their contempt and their \\"deep concern\\". Campo denied any involvement, while minister Londo√±o claimed the draft was sent anonymously to him. On 18 November 2004, a Bogot√° court sentenced columnist and film director Lisandro Duque to three days in jail and a 470 euros fine, for not publishing a rectification after a sentence for defamation, when in column published 13 April 2003 Duque criticized Claudia Triana de Vargas, manager of a film production company. Instead of rectifying, Duque wrote in a piece published 7 September that he had \\"no enough evidence\\" to support his criticism. Duque appealed the court sentence. ==El Espectador in the 21st century== ===Presence on the web=== Elespectador.com logo since March 2008 On 29 May 1996 the then daily newspaper launched its website elespectador.com. Its design format and layout have been changed several times In 2006 later added the .com to its logo, comments to the articles and user registration. Access hits to Elespectador.com grew 79% in 2007. On 7 March 2008 elespectador.com was revamped, setting up four \\"editions\\": online, latest news, news map and print version. It also improved the registration system and the RSS feeds, and added tags, audio, and videos taken from Noticias Caracol, newscast from sister network Caracol TV, uploaded to its YouTube channel. The website is built with Drupal. Elespectador.com received the Colombian Chamber of Computing and Telecommunications's Premio Colombia en L√≠nea 2008 award to the best online news website in the country. === From daily to weekly === Despite El Espectador had been the Colombian newspaper with the second highest circulation, after El Tiempo, the financial difficulties worsened and in 1997 the Cano family sold most of their shares in Comunican S.A., El Espectador publishing company, to Julio Mario Santo Domingo, who at the time owned Cromos, Caracol Radio (later sold to Spanish group PRISA) and Caracol TV. Its headquarters moved to the Avenida El Dorado. In September 2001 El Espectador became a weekly newspaper. RWB stated that \\"media diversity suffered a heavy blow\\" when the newspaper \\"downgraded itself to a weekly.\\" The Cali newspaper El Pa√≠s said: \\"El Espectador is a standard in defence of freedom, the fight against drug trafficking and corruption.\\" Since then, their editors Rodrigo Pardo, Carlos Lleras de la Fuente, Ricardo Santamar√≠a, and Fidel Cano Correa tried to recover the financial balance and the newspaper's circulation. As a weekly, it was published on Saturdays, with Sunday's date. Counting with the free time readers have available on weekends, El Espectador focused on opinion, investigation, and analysis pieces, recovering its circulation, influence, and earnings. In 2007 Fidel Cano Correa stated in an interview with Revista Semana that \\"[the return to a daily edition] is just a possibility. We have been doing very well during the last three years, especially the last one.\\" The Spanish group PRISA was considered as a strategic partner, but the negotiation failed when Santo Domingo refused to cede the control of the paper to PRISA. On 11 May 2008 El Espectador became a daily again, changing from broadsheet to tabloid format. ===Daily focus, supplements, and alliances=== Every day of the week, except Sunday, El Espectador devotes around 10 pages to a specific \\"focus\\": * Monday: Negocios (Business) * Thursday: Deportes (Sports) * Wednesday: Internacional (World news) * Thursday: Vivir (Living) * Friday: Cultura (Culture) * Saturday: Gente (People) It also publishes three magazines, published once in a month each: Autos/Motos, Espacios, and Discovery Health. On Mondays El Espectador publishes a 6-page edition of The New York Times International Weekly, see sample and on Tuesdays a two-paged Fox Sports minisection. It also syndicates articles from Harvard Business Review and El Pa√≠s. ===Design=== Since 2004, Lucie Lacava's Lacava Design has been in charge of El Espectador's design for its print edition. El Espectador uses Hoefler & Frere-Jones's Mercury and Gotham typefaces since then. ===Current management and employees=== nameplate used throughout the 20th century, until 2000.

He is suspected of having murdered three people: Kathleen McCormack Durst, his first wife, who disappeared in New York in 1982; Susan Berman, his longtime friend, who was killed in California in 2000; and his neighbor, Morris Black, who was killed in Texas in 2001. Durst was the subject of a multi-state manhunt after Black's body parts were found floating in Galveston Bay. Although he admitted to the dismembering of Black (which he was not charged with), he was ultimately acquitted of his murder on the grounds of self defense. On March 14, 2015, Durst was arrested in New Orleans on a first-degree murder warrant in relation to the Berman killing. On November 4, 2016, he was transferred to California and soon after was arraigned in Los Angeles on first-degree murder charges. In October 2018, Los Angeles County Superior Judge Mark Windham ruled there was sufficient evidence for Durst to be tried for the death of Berman. His trial began on March 2, 2020, but was postponed when Judge Windham announced that the trial, which had been under way for six days, will stand adjourned until a later date due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After additional COVID-19 related delays, and a denied defense motion for a mistrial, the trial is currently scheduled to resume on April 12, 2021. ==Early life== The eldest of four children, Robert Durst was born on April 12, 1943 and grew up in Scarsdale, New York, in a Jewish family. He is the son of real estate investor Seymour Durst and his wife Bernice Herstein. His siblings are Douglas, Tommy, and Wendy. Durst's paternal grandfather, Joseph Durst, who was a tailor when he emigrated from Austria-Hungary in 1902, eventually became a successful real estate manager and developer, founding the Durst Organization in 1927. Seymour became head of the family business in 1974 upon his father's death. When Robert was seven, his mother died as a result of a fall from the family's Scarsdale home; he later claimed that, moments before her death, his father walked him to a window from which he could see her standing on the roof. In a March 2015 New York Times interview, however, his brother Douglas denied that Robert had witnessed her death. As children, Robert and Douglas underwent counseling for sibling rivalry; a 1953 psychiatrist's report on 10-year-old Robert mentioned \\"personality decomposition and possibly even schizophrenia\\". Durst attended Scarsdale High School, where classmates described him as a loner. He earned a bachelor's degree in economics in 1965 from Lehigh University, where he was a member of the varsity lacrosse team and the business manager of The Brown and White student newspaper. He enrolled in a doctoral program at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) later that year, where he met Susan Berman, but eventually withdrew from the school and returned to New York in 1969. Durst went on to become a real estate developer in the Durst Organization; however, his brother Douglas was appointed, in 1992, to run the family business. The appointment caused a rift between Robert and his family. ==Capital Crimes for which Durst has been investigated== Police have directly questioned Durst, and sometimes conducted searches, in connection to the disappearance of his first wife, Kathie McCormack, and the homicides of Berman and Morris Black. He was tried and acquitted of murder in the Black case. ===Disappearance of Kathleen McCormack Durst=== In the fall of 1971, Durst met Kathleen \\"Kathie\\" McCormack, a medical student. After two dates, he invited McCormack to share his home in Vermont, where he had opened a health food store; she moved there in January 1972. However, Durst's father pressured him to move back to New York to work in the family business. The couple returned to Manhattan, where they married on April 12, 1973‚ÄîDurst's 30th birthday. Shortly before her disappearance, McCormack was a student in her fourth and final year at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in The Bronx and was only a few months short of earning her degree. She had intended to become a pediatrician. McCormack was last seen by someone other than Durst the evening of January 31, 1982, when she appeared unexpectedly at a dinner party thrown by her friend Gilberte Najamy in Newtown, Connecticut. Najamy noticed that McCormack was upset and was wearing red sweatpants, which Najamy found odd; McCormack had often dressed in much higher quality clothing. McCormack later left for her marital home in South Salem, New York, after a phone call from her husband. Although the couple argued and fought that evening, Durst maintained that he put his wife on a commuter train to New York City at Katonah station, had a drink with a neighbor, and spoke to his wife at their Manhattan apartment by telephone later that evening. \\"That's what I told police,\\" Durst later told documentary filmmakers. \\"I was hoping that would just make everything go away.\\" After McCormack had left Najamy's house, she was supposed to meet Najamy at a pub called The Lion's Gate in Manhattan. When she failed to show up, Najamy became concerned and repeatedly called the police for several days. Days later, Durst filed a missing person report as well. A doorman and the building superintendent at the couple's apartment on Riverside Drive claimed to have seen McCormack there on February 1, which was one day after she was last indisputably seen, but the doorman also said that he had seen her only from behind and from half a block away, and couldn't be certain that it was her. A private investigator, hired by Durst's own criminal lawyer, later reported that the doorman said he had not seen McCormack arrive at all, and may not have been working the night she disappeared. McCormack had been treated at a Bronx hospital for facial bruises three weeks before her disappearance. She told a friend that Durst beat her but did not press charges over the incident. McCormack asked Durst for a $250,000 divorce settlement. Instead, Durst cancelled his wife's credit card, removed her name from a joint bank account, and refused to pay her medical school tuition. At the time McCormack disappeared, Durst had been dating Prudence Farrow for three years and was living in a separate apartment. Durst initially offered $100,000 for his wife's return, then reduced the reward to $15,000. Only three weeks after Durst reported McCormack missing, the superintendent at the Riverside Drive apartment found her possessions in the building's trash compactor. When one of McCormack's friends and her sister found out that she had been reported missing, they broke into her cottage hoping to find her. Instead, they found the cottage ransacked, McCormack's mail left unopened, and her belongings in the trash. Investigation and aftermath After McCormack went missing, police said that Durst had claimed to have last spoken to her when she called him at the Riverside Drive apartment. He claimed that the last time he had seen her was at Katonah station, where she was planning to board a 9:15 p.m. train to Manhattan. He also claimed that on February 4, the supervisor at her medical school called him and said that she had called in sick on February 1 and was absent from class for the entire week. It is uncertain if it was indeed McCormack who made the call. The day after Durst received the call from McCormack's medical school, he reported her as missing. The police found his stories to be full of contradictions. Eight years after McCormack's disappearance, Durst divorced her, claiming spousal abandonment. In 2016, the McCormack family asked to have Kathleen declared dead, a request that was granted the following year. Kathleen's mother, Ann McCormack, attempted to sue Durst for $100 million, alleging that he killed McCormack and deprived them of the right to bury her. McCormack's parents are now deceased. Her younger sister, Mary McCormack Hughes, also believes that Durst murdered her. The New York State Police quietly re-opened the criminal investigation into the disappearance in 1999, searching Durst's former South Salem residence for the first time. The investigation became public in November 2000. In August 2019, a wrongful death lawsuit filed by McCormack's sister Carol Bamonte against Durst, which accused him of murdering his wife, was dismissed on the grounds that she had waited too long to file the suit. The death date for McCormack has been changed to be most likely at the time she disappeared in 1982, due to murder, instead of the previous determination of 1987 for a missing person. ===Homicide of Susan Berman=== Susan Berman, a longtime friend of Durst who had facilitated his public alibi after McCormack's disappearance, was the daughter of David Berman, a reputed gangster who in the late 1940s operated the Flamingo Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. On December 24, 2000, Berman was found murdered execution-style in her home in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles, California, after her neighbors called the police to report that her back door was open and her three fox terriers were loose. A few days later, the Beverly Hills Police Department received a handwritten note postmarked December 23, which contained Berman's address and the word \\"cadaver.\\" Durst is known to have been in northern California days before Berman was killed, and to have flown from San Francisco to New York the night before Berman's body was discovered. Berman had recently received $50,000 from Durst, in two payments. Although Durst confirmed to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) that he had sent her $25,000, and faxed investigators a copy of her 1982 deposition regarding his missing wife, he declined to be further questioned about Berman's murder. Durst said in a 2005 deposition that Berman called him shortly before her death to say that the LAPD wanted to talk to her about McCormack's disappearance. A study of case notes by The Guardian cast doubt on whether the LAPD had made such a call, or whether then-Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro had scheduled an interview with Berman at all. Durst moved to Galveston, Texas in 2000, and lived in a boarding house, as he had gone into hiding and begun posing as a woman to avoid police inquiries. Durst had been tipped off to the re-opened investigation into his wife's disappearance on October 31, 2000, and immediately began planning for life as a fugitive. Berman biographer Cathy Scott has asserted that Durst killed her because she knew too much about McCormack's disappearance. === Killing and dismemberment of Morris Black=== On October 9, 2001, Durst was arrested in Galveston shortly after body parts belonging to his elderly neighbor, Morris Black, were found floating in Galveston Bay. He was released on $300,000 bail the next day. Durst missed a court hearing on October 16 and a warrant was issued for his arrest on a charge of bail jumping. On November 30, he was caught inside a Wegmans supermarket in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, after trying to shoplift Band-Aids, a newspaper, and a chicken-salad sandwich, even though he had $500 cash in his pocket. A police search of his rental car yielded $37,000 in cash, two guns, marijuana, Black's driver's license, and directions to Gilberte Najamy's home in Connecticut. Durst also used his time on the run to stalk his brother Douglas, visiting the driveway of his home in Katonah, New York while armed. Durst employed defense attorney John Waldron while he was held on charges in Pennsylvania. He was eventually extradited to Texas for trial. Trial In 2003, Durst was tried for the murder of Black. He employed defense attorney Dick DeGuerin and claimed self-defense; DeGuerin conducted two mock trials in preparation for the case. Durst's defense team had difficulty communicating with him, so they hired psychiatrist Dr. Milton Altschuler to find out why. Altschuler spent over 70 hours examining Durst and diagnosed him with Asperger syndrome, saying, \\"His whole life's history is so compatible with a diagnosis of Asperger's disorder.\\" His defense team argued at trial that the diagnosis explained his behavior. Durst claimed he and Black, a cranky and confrontational loner, struggled for control of Durst's .22-caliber target pistol after Black grabbed it from its hiding place and threatened him with it. During the struggle, the pistol discharged, shooting Black in the face. During cross-examination, Durst admitted to using a paring knife, two saws, and an axe to dismember Black's body before bagging and dumping his remains in Galveston Bay. Black's head was never recovered, so prosecutors were unable to present sufficient forensic evidence to dispute Durst's account of the struggle. As a result of lack of forensics, the jury acquitted Durst of murder on 11 November 2003. On 21 December 2004, Durst pleaded guilty to two counts of bail jumping and one count of evidence tampering (for his dismemberment of Black's body). As part of a plea bargain, he received a sentence of five years and was given credit for time served, requiring him to serve three years in prison. Durst was paroled on 15 July 2005. The rules of his release required him to stay near his home; permission was required to travel. That December, Durst made an unauthorized trip to the boarding house where Black had been killed and to a nearby shopping mall. At the mall, he ran into former Galveston trial judge Susan Criss, who had presided over his trial. Due to this incident, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles determined that Durst had violated the terms of his parole and returned him to jail. He was released again from custody on March 1, 2006. Asked in March 2015 whether she believed Durst murdered Black, Criss commented: \\"You could see that this person knew what they were doing and that it was not a first time. The body was cut perfectly like a surgeon who knew how to use this tool on this bone and a certain kind of tool on that muscle. It looked like not a first-time job. That was pretty scary.\\" == The Jinx TV Documentary == In early 2015, a six-part HBO documentary titled The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst described circumstantial evidence linking Durst to the murder of Berman, who was believed to have knowledge of McCormack's disappearance. The documentary detailed the disappearance of McCormack, Berman's subsequent death, and the killing of Black. Against the advice of his lawyers and his wife Debrah Lee Charatan, Durst gave multiple interviews and unrestricted access to his personal records to the filmmakers. The FBI arrested Durst in New Orleans on the same day as the final episode was broadcast. The documentary ended with him moving into a bathroom where his microphone recorded him seemingly saying to himself: \\"There it is. You're caught! .... You're right, of course. But you can't imagine. ... Arrest him ... I don't know what's in the house ... Oh, I want this ... What a disaster ... He was right. I was wrong. And the burping ... I'm having difficulty with the question ... What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.\\" The Associated Press reported that a March 1999 letter from Durst to Berman, discovered by her stepson and turned over to the filmmakers during their research, provided \\"key new evidence\\" leading to the filing of murder charges. ==Berman trial== ===Arrest=== A few days after a first-degree murder warrant was signed by a Los Angeles judge in relation to the Berman killing, Durst was arrested by FBI agents on March 14, 2015, at the Canal Street Marriott in New Orleans, where he had registered under the false name \\"Everette Ward.\\" Durst, who had been tracked to the hotel after making two calls to check his voicemail, was observed wandering aimlessly in the lobby and mumbling to himself, having driven to New Orleans from Houston four days before. In addition to a .38 revolver loaded with four live rounds and one spent shell casing, police recovered five ounces of marijuana, Durst's birth certificate and passport, maps of Louisiana, Florida, and Cuba, a \\"flesh-toned\\" latex mask, the fake Texas ID used to check into the hotel, a new cellphone, and cash totaling $42,631. Police discovered a UPS tracking number, which led to an additional $117,000 cash and a pair of shoes in a package sent to Durst by a friend in New York, which was seized after his arrest. Bank statements found in one of Durst's Houston condominiums revealed cash withdrawals of $315,000 in little more than a month. On March 15, 2015, New York State Police investigator Joseph Becerra, long involved with the McCormack case and said to have been working closely with the FBI and Los Angeles detectives, removed some 60 file boxes of Durst's personal papers and effects from the home of Durst's friend Susan T. Giordano in Campbell Hall, New York. All of these items had been sent to Giordano for safekeeping three years prior by Debrah Lee Charatan, Durst's wife at the time. Also stored at Giordano's residence were videotaped depositions of Durst; Durst's brother, Douglas; and Charatan, all of which were related to the Black case. Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney John Lewin, in charge of prosecuting Durst, claimed to have found information uncovered by the filmmakers in the HBO documentary series The Jinx to be compelling and repeatedly flew to New York to interview witnesses, including friends of Durst and Berman. ===Firearm charge=== On March 16, 2015, defense attorney Richard DeGuerin advised court authorities in New Orleans that his client waived extradition and would voluntarily return to California. Late that same day, Louisiana State Police filed charges against Durst for being a felon in possession of a firearm and for possession of a firearm with a controlled substance, forestalling his immediate return to California. Orleans Parish District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro commented that, in light of prior convictions that could influence Durst's sentencing, \\"[j]ust for those gun charges here in Louisiana, [Durst] could face up to life in prison\\". On March 23, Durst was denied bail by a Louisiana judge after prosecutors argued he was a flight risk. In an effort to hasten his extradition to California and avoid a protracted Louisiana court battle, DeGuerin raised questions about the validity of the New Orleans arrest and hotel room search, pointing out that a local judge did not issue a warrant until hours after his client was detained. While communicating with the LAPD and conducting an inventory of Durst's hotel room possessions, \\"[t]he FBI ... held him there, incommunicado, for almost eight hours\\". According to DeGuerin, Durst was questioned extensively by a Los Angeles prosecutor and detective, without a lawyer present, on the morning after his arrest. In failing to produce the arresting officers subpoenaed for a probable cause hearing, Durst's attorneys charged that Louisiana prosecutors engaged in a \\"misguided attempt to conceal the facts from the court, the defendant, and the public.\\"State of Louisiana v. Robert Durst: Defendant Robert Durst's Motion and Incorporated Memorandum For Finding Of No Probable Cause , Click2houston.com, April 3, 2015; accessed April 6, 2015. Peter Mansfield, an Assistant U.S. Attorney, said that his office instructed the two FBI agents and arresting officer not to appear, arguing that DeGuerin's subpoenas were issued in an attempt to conduct \\"actions against them in their official capacities for the purpose of obtaining testimony, information and material maintained under color of their official duties.\\" On April 8, a day after the U.S. Attorney filed an independent federal weapons charge, Durst was formally indicted by a Louisiana grand jury for carrying a weapon with a controlled substance and for the illegal possession of a firearm by a felon. Later that month, Durst's lawyers requested that more than $161,000 seized by authorities during their searches be returned, saying the cash \\"is not needed as evidence, is not contraband, and is not subject to forfeiture.\\" After negotiations with Durst's defense team, Louisiana authorities ultimately dropped weapons charges against Durst on April 23, 2015. Durst's trial on the federal weapons charge was scheduled for September 21, 2015. DeGuerin confirmed rumors that Durst was in poor health, stating that he suffers from hydrocephalus and had a stent put into his skull two years before, as well as spinal surgery and a cancerous mass removed from his esophagus. Durst's attorneys requested a later date for the federal weapons charge trial, saying they'd need more time to prepare after rulings on pending motions. U.S. District Judge Helen Berrigan later rescheduled the trial to January 11, 2016. On November 16, 2015, a New Orleans federal judge ordered Durst re-arraigned on the weapons charges and scheduled a hearing for December 17. When asked, Durst's attorney said only that Durst did not kill Berman, and that he wants to resolve the other charges to expedite Durst's extradition to Los Angeles to face that charge. On December 16, 2015, prosecutors and defense attorneys told Berrigan in a joint motion that scheduling conflicts ruled out all dates before a January 11 trial date. Berrigan ultimately rescheduled the trial for February 3, 2016, and Durst changed his plea to guilty to the federal gun charge and received an 85-month prison sentence. ===Incarceration=== Durst (BOP Number 45101-079) was originally placed in USP Terre Haute, but was later transferred to a Los Angeles County Jail awaiting trial. ===Trial=== The trial was scheduled to begin in Los Angeles after Durst was arraigned in California, but his transfer was delayed by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons due to \\"serious surgery,\\" according to DeGuerin. A conditional hearing was convened in February 2017, where Nick Chavin, Durst's close friend and best man at Chavin's wedding, testified that Durst had confessed to him of having murdered Berman. Chavin will be one of the prosecution's witnesses against Durst. A preliminary hearing was initially scheduled for October 2017, but was postponed to April 2018 to accommodate Durst's defense team, some of whom suffered damage to their homes and offices from Hurricane Harvey. The pretrial hearings included extensive testimony from a number of older witnesses who potentially would not be available when the trial itself begins. In October 2018, Los Angeles County Superior Judge Mark Windham ruled there was enough evidence to try Durst for the murder of Berman, and Durst would be arraigned November 8, 2018. During his court appearance the following day, Durst pleaded not guilty. In January 2019, Windham set Durst's trial date as September 3, 2019. At the same time the judge ruled that prosecutors can present evidence involving the Black murder. Prosecutors will try to connect Berman's death with McCormack's disappearance, which they want to show as the foundation for the motive for Berman's slaying. In his ruling that prosecutors could use evidence from the Texas case, Judge Windham said the killings of Black and Berman seemed \\"to be intertwined.\\" The murder charge against Durst includes the special circumstance allegations of lying in wait and killing a witness to a crime. There is also an allegation that he used a handgun to carry out the murder. In May 2019, a motion filed by Durst's attorneys claimed two handwriting samples (the anonymous \\"cadaver note\\" from 2000 informing Beverly Hills Police that a body could be found at her house, and a letter in 1999 from Durst to Berman), along with other evidence from his 2015 arrest at his hotel in New Orleans, were illegally obtained. Durst's lawyers also claim there was a Fourth Amendment violation that would exclude the New Orleans evidence and that the search of his hotel room was unlawful. On May 8, 2019, Los Angeles County prosecutors filed an affidavit replying to the motion. Prosecutor John Lewin said Durst is creating an elaborate conspiracy theory between the producers of the HBO documentary miniseries The Jinx, law enforcement officers, and the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, to make the \\"Defendant incriminate himself and to time his arrest to maximize media attention and ratings. However, Defendant completely fails to acknowledge the most relevant fact leading to his arrest and the subsequent search of his hotel room and damning interview‚Äîlaw enforcement was on notice that Defendant was actively preparing to flee the country right after crucial evidence connecting him to Susan's (Berman) murder was widely publicized on national television. When viewed in this context, it is readily apparent that the actions taken by law enforcement were more than reasonable‚Äîthey were absolutely necessary to prevent a murderer, who had already avoided apprehension for more than 30 years, from fleeing the country and evading justice.\\" On May 17, 2019, LA County Judge Mark Windham granted Durst's defense team a four-month postponement of his murder trial. The delay was granted after defense lawyers raised concerns about the volume of evidence in the case and conflicts with attorney schedules. On September 3, 2019, LA County Judge Mark Windham rejected an attempt by defense attorneys for Durst to strip the producers of The Jinx of protection under California's journalist shield law by having them declared \\"government agents.\\" A number of other procedural rulings also went against Durst. LA County Prosecuting Attorney John Lewin set another hearing on discovery and other matters for October 28. Additional evidential hearings were held in December 2019 regarding the admissibility of statements Durst made in March 2015 just after his arrest in New Orleans, at an interview with Lewin. In a surprise move on December 24, 2019, Durst's lawyers contradicted his previous statements and filed court documents admitting that Durst wrote the \\"cadaver note.\\" In all previous statements about the note, Durst consistently denied writing the note, although the handwriting appears to be identical to his own as is the misspelling of the word \\"Beverley\\" contained in a prior letter to Berman that Durst admitted to authoring. During the filming of The Jinx, Durst told the filmmakers that the person who wrote the \\"cadaver note\\" was taking a \\"big risk,\\" because it was something \\"that only the killer could have written.\\" He told his godson, Howard Altman, \\"The person who wrote the note killed her.\\" However, in August 2019, Durst's attorneys also argued that \\"What the note demonstrates is that the person who mailed it was aware that there was a body at the house, not that the individual murdered Susan Berman.\\" On 2 March 2020, Durst appeared in court to begin his trial for the murder of Susan Berman, which was expected to take several months. However, the proceedings were postponed amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2020, a motion by the defense for a mistrial because of the delay was denied. In July 2020, LA County Judge Mark Windham ruled that a further delay until April 2021 was necessary due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but he would allow the trial to proceed if Durst agreed to a bench trial, without jury. Durst declined this option and the trial is scheduled to resume on April 12, 2021. ==Other cases== Days after the Berman murder, police were reportedly examining connections between Durst and the disappearances of 18-year-old Lynne Schulze from Middlebury, Vermont and 16-year-old Karen Mitchell from Eureka, California. Investigators are also looking into a possible connection between Durst and the disappearance of 18-year-old Kristen Modafferi, who was last seen in San Francisco in 1997. Schulze, a Middlebury College freshman, visited Durst's health food store on December 10, 1971, the day she disappeared, and was last seen that afternoon near a bus stop across from the store. DeGuerin characterized the Schulze investigation as \\"opportunistic\\" and said he would not permit his client to be questioned by Vermont police. Author and investigative journalist Matt Birkbeck reported in 2003, and again in his 2015 book A Deadly Secret, that credit card records placed Durst in Eureka on November 25, 1997, the day Mitchell vanished. Mitchell may have volunteered in a homeless shelter that Durst frequented; Durst, dressed in women's clothing, had visited the Eureka shoe store owned by Mitchell's aunt. Mitchell was last seen walking to work from her aunt's store and possibly speaking to someone in a stopped car; a witness sketch of Mitchell's presumed abductor resembles Durst. Although the FBI ultimately could not connect Durst to the Long Island serial murders (in which some victims were disposed of in a similar manner to the Black killing), the Bureau created an informal task force in 2012 to work with investigative agencies in jurisdictions where Durst was known to have lived in past decades, including Vermont, New York, and California. In the wake of his recent arrest, the FBI encouraged such localities to re-examine cold cases. Texas private investigator Bobbi Bacha has also traced Durst operating under stolen identities in Texas, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, South Carolina, Mississippi, and Virginia. ==Personal life== On December 11, 2000, shortly before the Berman killing, Durst married Debrah Lee Charatan. According to The New York Times, the couple briefly shared a Fifth Avenue apartment in 1990 but \\"have never lived together as husband and wife.\\" Durst once told his sister that it was \\"a marriage of convenience\\"; \\"I wanted Debbie to be able to receive my inheritance, and I intended to kill myself,\\" Durst said in a 2005 deposition. According to The New York Times, Charatan lived with one of Durst's real estate lawyers, Steven I. Holm, as of May 2017. It was reported in Real Estate Weekly that Stephen I. Holm died on October 17, 2019, and Debrah Lee Charatan was his wife. After being referred to as Holm's wife at his funeral, and in the obituary in the New York Times, Charatan sent the Times a letter saying she and Holm were not married and asked them to print a retraction. Charatan and Holm were involved with a number of philanthropic ventures together. Durst traveled and lived under dozens of aliases over the years, using different identities to buy cars, rent apartments, and open credit card accounts. \\"He had a scanner, copier, and a laminating machine,\\" a former office employee of Durst told Newsweek. \\"What I didn't realize is that I unwittingly saw what would have allowed Robert Durst to make a fake driver's license.\\" Durst was also \\"a prolific user of private mailboxes,\\" and apparently conducted business under a number of canine-themed names: Woofing LLC, WoofWoof LLC, and Igor-Fayette Inc. In the early 1980s, Durst owned a series of seven Alaskan Malamutes, all of which were named Igor and all of which died under mysterious circumstances, according to his brother, Douglas. In December 2014, prior to the airing of The Jinx, Douglas told The New York Times that, \\"In retrospect, I now believe he was practicing killing and disposing [of] his wife with those dogs.\\" Durst was once recorded saying he wanted to \\"Igor\\" Douglas. Durst, however, has disputed the assertion that he owned seven dogs named Igor; he owned three, he said, one that was run over and another that died in surgery after eating an apple core, \\"before the Igor that lasted forever.\\" In late 1981, while Durst was still married to McCormack, he was nearing the end of a three-year affair with Prudence Farrow, who was also married at the time. According to the New York Post, a few months before McCormack's disappearance in January 1982, Farrow called her and asked that she give Durst up, as friends said she wanted him all to herself. After Durst was acquitted of murdering Black in 2003, Farrow contacted law enforcement authorities with concerns for her safety, as she said Durst was angry with her for terminating their relationship three days before McCormack disappeared. Durst has had a number of significant medical issues since 2015, including major surgeries for esophageal cancer, having a shunt installed in his brain for hydrocephalus, and cervical spinal fusion. When arrested in New Orleans in 2015, he was found to be in possession a variety of drugs, including the sleep aid melatonin, a muscle relaxant, and medications for high blood pressure, blood flow, and acid reflux.https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-durst- health-20150407-story.html ===Financial status and residences=== In mid-2002, Durst signed over a power of attorney to Charatan, and it is believed their holdings remain closely intermingled, although the current status of their relationship is unknown. In 2006, Durst gave Charatan around $20 million of his $65 million trust settlement. In 2011, Durst purchased a $1.75 million townhouse on Lenox Avenue in Harlem. A source close to his estranged family confirmed that he was living there at least some of the time, and they were keeping him under surveillance. Durst also owns three condominiums in a multi- story complex in Houston, and after filing suit, received a $200,000 settlement in 2006 from a Houston developer who refused to let him move into a unit newly purchased by his wife, which she had then immediately resold to Durst for $10. At the time of Berman's murder in Los Angeles, Durst had just sold a home in Trinidad, California, but maintained an office in Eureka while renting in nearby Big Lagoon. Media have variously reported Durst's financial status as \\"real estate baron,\\" \\"rich scion,\\" \\"millionaire,\\" \\"multimillionaire,\\" and \\"billionaire.\\" The Durst family's real estate holdings are worth more than $4 billion, but his brother Douglas was in control of the company beginning in 1994, shortly before their father's death. From about 1994 to 2006, Robert waged a legal campaign to gain greater control of the family trust and fortune. During that time he received $2 million a year from the trust. In 2006 the case was settled, with Durst giving up any interest in his family's properties and trusts in exchange for a one-time payment of about $65 million. It is unknown how much of that went to legal fees and taxes. Durst remained active in real estate; he reportedly sold two properties in 2014 for $21.15 million after purchasing them in 2011 for $8.65 million. At the time of his 2015 arrest, the FBI estimated Durst's net worth at approximately $100 million; The New York Times estimated his net worth at $110 million. On May 1, 2015, the New York Post reported that Douglas had settled litigation against Jinx filmmaker Andrew Jarecki, having confirmed that Robert was the source of videotaped depositions that appeared in the documentary. Robert's disclosure apparently violated the terms of his 2006 agreement with the Durst family, which had dispersed to him a lump sum of family trust assets. Although it was unclear whether Jarecki confirmed Robert as his source --The New York Times reported in March 2015 that Jarecki was given \\"unrestricted access\\" to Robert's personal records, including the videotaped material--the settlement paves the way for Douglas to reclaim as much as $74 million of his brother's assets, effectively freezing those assets pending court judgment. This could affect Robert's ability to pay for high-caliber legal representation without tapping into real estate or other investments. The Post reported that Douglas was \\"mulling his next move.\\" In November 2015, nearly 34 years after her disappearance, McCormack's three sisters and 101-year-old mother sued Durst for $100 million, citing his apparent role in her murder and his denial to her family of the \\"right to sepulcher,\\" a New York law that grants immediate relatives access to a deceased person's body and the opportunity to determine appropriate burial. If successful, the lawsuit could deprive Durst of most or all of his inherited fortune. McCormack's brother James had attempted in October 2015 to file a wrongful death suit against Durst on behalf of his mother, but was challenged by one of his sisters, who holds her mother's power of attorney. DeGuerin said that \\"there is no evidence that Robert Durst had anything to do with Kathleen's disappearance. Anybody can file a lawsuit, but eventually they'll have to come with evidence.\\" On December 7, 2015, the same family members filed a suit asking the court to freeze Durst's assets. The family's attorney, Robert Abrams, called Durst the \\"poster child\\" for why courts block defendants from disposing assets while civil lawsuits are pending. In July 2016, the McCormack family asked the Surrogate's Court in Manhattan to \\"declare that Kathie died on January 31, 1982, when she was murdered by her husband, Robert Durst\\" so the sepulcher lawsuit could proceed. The court granted the request in 2017. ===Other legal issues=== In 2012 and 2013, Durst's family members sought and received restraining orders against him, claiming they were afraid of him. Durst was charged with trespassing in New York for walking in front of townhouses owned by his brother Douglas and other family members. He went on trial and was acquitted in December 2014. The judge also vacated the thirteen orders of protection his family members had taken out on him. In July 2014, Durst was arrested after turning himself in to police following an incident at a Houston CVS drugstore in which he allegedly exposed himself without provocation and urinated on a rack of candy. He then left the store and casually walked down the street. Durst was charged with misdemeanor criminal mischief. In December 2014, he pleaded \\"no contest\\" and was fined $500. His lawyer described the incident as an \\"unfortunate medical mishap,\\" as Durst had just been released from a hospital where he had undergone two medical procedures. The incident was recorded on videotape. ==In popular culture== * The events surrounding Durst inspired the 2010 film All Good Things, the title of which is a reference to a health food store of the same name set up by Durst and his wife in the 1970s. David Marks, the character based on Durst, was portrayed by Ryan Gosling. Shortly after its theatrical release, Robert Durst saw the film and contacted director Andrew Jarecki, expressing admiration for the film, which evolved into discussions between the two of them being included on the DVD video release, and eventually resulting in Jarecki co-writing, co-producing, directing, and appearing in the 2015 HBO six-part documentary series about Durst titled The Jinx. * Three episodes in the Law & Order television franchise gave different takes on the murders: The Law & Order episode \\"Hands Free\\"; the Law & Order: Criminal Intent episode \\"Maledictus\\"; and the Law & Order: Special Victims Unit episode \\"Devil's Dissections.\\" * Fred Armisen played Robert Durst in a 2003 sketch on Saturday Night Live and again in 2016 on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Kate McKinnon played Robert Durst in a 2015 SNL sketch. *The American Court TV (now TruTV) television series Mugshots released an episode covering Durst, titled Robert Durst‚ÄîMogul in Murder Mystery. *A&E; and Lifetime announced in August 2016 that they were developing a movie based on the book A Deadly Secret. The television movie, titled The Lost Wife of Robert Durst, originally aired on November 11, 2017. *Investigation Discovery network released a special miniseries titled Robert Durst: An ID Murder Mystery, containing new interviews with friends and family of Durst's alleged victims, along with his defense attorney Dick DeGuerin.

Usually, they are not only \\"beer drinking events\\", they are fun fairs and folk festivals. Many of them are held for centuries and have their origins in parish fairs, markets and trade fairs or other historical reasons. In some German regions, especially in South West Germany fun fairs are more connected with wine than beer festivals. It is commonly said that the largest beer festival in the world is Oktoberfest in Germany, though some argue that is actually a folk festival not a beer festival. Several other smaller beer festivals are held all over Germany throughout the year. The second largest beer festival in Germany and probably in Europe, is the Cannstatter Volksfest, hosted on the Cannstatter Wasen in the Bad Canstatt district of Stuttgart. It starts one week later and is very similar in character to Oktoberfest. Its popularity increases and more and more people come from around the world to visit the festival every year. Many places have beer festivals styled as \\"Oktoberfests\\", but taken on its own the name is generally taken to mean for the Munich event. Smaller beer festivals similar to the Oktoberfest are common in Germany and take place throughout the year in most bigger German cities. Some of them go on later into the night than the Oktoberfest. Another large genuine Bavarian festival is the G√§ubodenvolksfest in Straubing. The festival is similar to Oktoberfest but it has an own history and it is not a copy of the Oktoberfest, as is the Barthelmarkt by Manching, which even dates back to Roman times. Other large festivals in Bavaria are N√ºrnberg Volksfeste in spring and autumn, F√ºrth Michaeliskirchweih (held since 12th century) and the Bergkirchweih in Erlangen, with the largest open-air beer garden in Europe. Other beer festivals include the Hanover Sch√ºtzenfest, the Freimarkt in Bremen, the Hamburger Dom, the Stuttgarter Fr√ºhlingsfest, the Cranger Funfair, the D√ºsseldorf Funfair. Like the Oktoberfest and the Cannstatter Volksfest, most German beer festivals are also funfairs. They are called \\"Volksfest\\" (festival for the people) and are numerous in Germany. An emerging festival located in Berlin boasts the world's longest beer garden.International Bier Festival The International Berlin Beer Festival hosts over 2,100 different beers from 86 countries.Berliner-Zeitung - 'Bierfestival auf der karl marx allee begonnen' === United Kingdom === Reading Beer Festival 2009 British beer festivals focus on draught real ale, although bottled beers and ciders are often included. There is also an emphasis on variety as well as volume. Festivals can be organised by the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA), pubs, brewers, social and sporting societies or charities. CAMRA festivals are run by volunteers under the direction of local branches and the admission fee is reduced or waived for CAMRA members. Pub festivals use professional bar staff and there is usually no entry fee. Larger British beer festivals are usually held in large indoor venues (Kensington Olympia in the case of the GBBF). Casks of ale from different brewers, numbering in the hundreds, are placed on stillage behind rows of trestle tables. Staff serve beer directly from the cask and take payment in the form of cash or tokens purchased at the entrance. Cooling is achieved using wet sacking or blankets for evaporative cooling or though refrigerated cooling saddles and coils. Glasses are distributed at the entrance to the venue, usually for a small deposit although often included in the entrance fee, often bearing a design specific to the festival. A beer list is usually available, often indicating where in the venue the different casks will be situated. Food is usually available, and entertainment and games such as live music, pub quizzes or tombolas are often organised. Medium-sized festival are typically held in meeting halls or marquees. These include festivals organised by local CAMRA branches, Round Tables or by other clubs and charities. They may be themed, emphasizing beers from a certain region or in a particular style, for instance, the Winter Great British Beer Festivalhttps://winter.gbbf.org.uk/ (Formerly the National Winter Ales Festival). If a pub is well-provided with handpumps, it can put on a small festival by rotating guest beers rapidly through them. Alternatively, a temporary stillage may be set up inside the bar, or in a tent outside. Pub- based festivals usually last a weekend, (in fact, often a long weekend). The pubco Wetherpoon holds simultaneous festivals twice-yearly in all the hundreds of branch in its chain, lasting over two weeks, and using the handpump rotation method. It claims its festivals are Britain's largest. The number of different beers that can be provided in a pub festival ranges from about 15 to about 100. In all British festivals the beer is sold in quantities of half or full pints. From 2006 the GBBF additionally served beer in \\"nips\\" (one-third of a pint), for the benefit of those who wish to sample many beers without consuming excessive amounts of alcohol.  Notable British beer festivals  Beer festivals are held across the United Kingdom. Notable ones include: * The Great British Beer Festival held annually in August in London is the largest beer festival in the UK organised by the Campaign for Real Ale. The \\"GBBF\\", founded in 1977, was attended by over 66,000 people in 2006 when 350,000 pints of ale were consumed over the five days. In the past it has been held at various locations but London has been its venue since 1991. * The Peterborough Beer Festival is the biggest outdoor CAMRA real ale festival in the UK and is the second largest beer festival in the UK behind the Great British Beer Festival. It is a 5-day event situated on the Embankment in 3 very large marquees which always takes place in the run up to August Bank Holiday weekend. * Romsey Beer Festival, held at the end of October or start of November each year at Crosfield Hall in Romsey. Widely acknowledged as offering the best selection of local beers from any Beer Festival in the country, all proceeds are donated to local charities and good causes. * The CAMRA Great British Beer Festival Winter; held at various locations, currently Birmingham, is designed to showcase beer styles which may not be readily available during the summer festival. Taking place every February, it has also been celebrated in Glasgow, Burton-on-Trent, Manchester, Derby and Norwich. * The Farnham Beer Exhibition in Surrey, having been held every year since 1977 at the Farnham Maltings, is the longest-running beer festival to be held annually on a single site in the United Kingdom, and every year sells over 29,000 pints of real ale during its 3-day opening. * The Cambridge Beer Festival, held since 1974, is the longest running beer festival, although it has changed venue three times.

Like most other towns in the East Fjords, it is surrounded by mountains, of which the highest is about . Although the climate is particularly rainy and foggy, on clear summer days it often has the highest temperatures in Iceland. From the early 20th century, Rey√∞arfj√∂r√∞ur was a trading port, as well as a fishing port. Due to its strategic location and good harbour conditions, it became the second-largest of the Allied bases in Iceland during World War II. There is a World War II museum located at the old camp above the town. Rey√∞arfj√∂r√∞ur joined Eskifj√∂r√∞ur and Neskaupsta√∞ur in 1998 to form the new municipality of Fjar√∞abygg√∞ (\\"fjords-settlement\\"). ==Geography== The other villages composing the municipality are: Eskifj√∂r√∞ur (1,043 inh.), F√°skr√∫√∞sfj√∂r√∞ur (662 inh.), Mj√≥ifj√∂r√∞ur (35 inh.), Neskaupsta√∞ur (1,437 inh.)Located in the Nor√∞fj√∂r√∞ur and St√∂√∞varfj√∂r√∞ur (203 inh.).

At one point, the town had the highest concentration of foreign residents of any community in the country, and the number of workers reached as high as 2,800.

The Fjar√∞a√°l aluminium smelter reached full production capacity in April 2008. The facility contains a smelter, cast house, rod production and deep-water port. The smelter employs 450 people and produces 940 tons of aluminium a day, with capacity of 346,000 metric tons of aluminium per year.

Portman Members Against the Takeover, a protest group created against the merger, argued that \\"there is nothing wrong with Portman; it can exist on its own\\", and cited loss of jobs, customer service and members' interests as reasons that the merger should not go ahead.Portman Protest web site ‚Äì the unsuccessful campaign against the merger of the Portman Building Society with the Nationwide Building Society The campaign attracted significant media attention. Bournemouth Counciller Ron Whittaker, himself a Portman account holder, appealed to Portman members to vote against the merger and \\"not to be taken in by handouts\\", in reference to the windfall offered. Financial observers questioned the benefits of a merger (describing it as more akin to a takeover) citing issues such as job losses, less competitive rates and lower service standards as disadvantages. Just months prior to the announcement of merger plans, Portman executive directors had argued that the interests of Portman members would be best served by it remaining an independent mutual building society. As part of the merger tender presented by Nationwide, Portman executive directors were offered the incentive of higher paid jobs on the board of the Nationwide should the planned merger take place. Portman executive directors had further personal interest in the merger being approved as a large portion of their bonuses were dependent on the merger being completed, a fact that was omitted from the merger booklet provided to Portman members and not disclosed until after the merger votes had been submitted. Merger information presented to voters suggested that they should vote in favour of the proposed merger, advice in direct contrast to that expressed by the same Portman board before they had received Nationwide's incentive-laden offer. The merger was overwhelmingly endorsed by members at the society's AGM on 23 April 2007. After the Financial Services Authority (FSA) endorsed the members' decision on 26 July 2007, the society became part of the Nationwide on 28 August 2007. When the merger was announced it was anticipated that it would result in 900 redundancies.

The line was soon absorbed by the London and North Western Railway, which in turn became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923. Vaughan Street in Llandudno was also laid out in 1858 as the station approach road. As the first station had become inadequate to cope with increasing usage, the present Llandudno station buildings and frontage together with five platforms and an extensive glass roof were erected in 1892 and the station still has the Victorian carriage road between the two principal platforms. Platforms 4 & 5 had been disused since 1978 with the tracks to the platforms being disconnected and eventually dismantled in 2012. The southernmost half of the glass roof was removed some decades ago, and the remainder was substantially cut back again in 1990.

Several models were available with 48 kB, 96 kB or 128 kB RAM. It was possible to reach 192 kB with RAM expansions on board. John Shireff designed the hardware and Davis Jansons the firmware. The machine was based around a Z80A CPU clocked at 4 MHz (6 MHz for the 128/192 kB models) and featured a Motorola 6845 as video controller. It was possible to run CP/M with the optional 5.25\\" floppy disk-drive on the 96 kB and 128 kB models. The machine was quite advanced for its time. A 48k machine cost ¬£225, a 96k machine ¬£299 and a 128k machine ¬£345. When compared to its competitors, such as the Sinclair ZX Spectrum and the Oric 1, it was also fairly highly priced. Camputers rebranded and relaunched each machine on several occasions, with the 48k machine renamed the Leisure, and the 128k machine renamed as the Laureate. The machine had very little software available, and survived only until Camputers ceased trading in June 1984. It is believed that approximately 30,000 Camputers Lynx units were sold worldwide. Anston Technology took over in November 1984 and a re-launch was planned but never happened. In June 1986, Anston sold everything - hardware, design rights and thousands of cassettes - to the National Lynx User Group. The group planned to produce a Super-Lynx but was too busy supplying spares and technical information to owners of existing models, and the project never came into being. Unique features of this computer (compared to other home computers at the time) includes: * All numbers were floating point BCD numbers (even line numbers). * The computer always ran in \\"high\\" resolution graphics mode (256x252 pixels in eight colours) using 6 times 10 pixels characters. Only a few bytes of graphic memory could be manipulated during the horizontal sync period, and thus graphics were extremely slow compared to most other computers. * Up to 192 kB of RAM and 20 kB of ROM (16 kB on the smallest model) on a 16 bit address bus was implemented using special hardware. As a consequence, certain RAM areas shadowed by ROM could only be used for data storage and the video memory had a green and alternative green bank that could be switched by a hardware register. * For sound it had a simple (6 bit) DAC. A comparator was included to serve as an ADC (primarily used for reading from tape drives). Compared to, for example, the Commodore 64, the BASIC was more extensive and faster and resolution of graphics was better; but computer games on the other hand suffered from the special implementation and lack of hardware for sound and sprites. ==Reception== After seeing a preview of the Camputer Lynx at the Personal Computer World Show, BYTE in January 1983 stated that it \\"offers more computing power for the money than any other machine I saw there\\". Computing Today in June 1983 criticized the manual as \\"put together in something of a hurry ... confusing\\" and criticized the computer for not meeting published specifications and having manufacturing defects. It concluded that the Lynx \\"could be seen as a flawed jewel ... If the less satisfactory aspects can be put to rights, it could prove to be a very popular machine. That, however, could entail some sacrifices.\\" ==References== Camputers Lynx Category:Computer-related introductions in 1983 ","title":"Camputers Lynx"},{"id":"3254385","text":"The Cebu Coliseum is an indoor arena in Cebu City, Philippines.

Its territory is included in the Tuscan- Romagnolo Apennines. ==History== Ancient Sarsina or Sassina was a town of the Umbri. Captured by Cornelius Scipio in 271 BC, it became later a municipium of the Roman empire. In 266 BC Roman consuls celebrated a triumph over the Sassinates. It is mentioned in the Fasti, and in the enumeration of the Italian allies of the Romans in 225 BCE the Umbri and Sassinates are mentioned, on an equal footing, as providing 20,000 men between them. It is possible that the tribus Sapinia (the name of which is derived from the river Sapis) mentioned by Livy in the account of the Roman marches against the Boii in 201 BC and 196 BC formed a part of the Sassinates. The playwright Plautus was native of Sassina. The town had a strategic importance, as inscriptions, preserved in the local museum, show. Its milk is frequently mentioned; it was the centre of a pasture district and it provided a number of recruits for the Praetorian Guard. In the 10th century the bishops obtained the temporal sovereignty of the city and the surrounding district, which thus became a prince-bishopric. From 1327 till 1400 it was disputed for by the Ordelaffi of Forl√¨, the popes and the bishops. In the fifteenth century it was subject in turn to the Malatesta family of Cesena, and then to the Malatesta branch of Rimini, from whom it was taken by Cesare Borgia (1500‚Äì03), on whose death it was captured by the Venetians (1503‚Äì09). In 1518 it was enfeoffed to the Pio di Meldola, passing later to the Aldobrandini. ==Main sights== The city contains remains of several ancient buildings, one of which probably was the public baths. Furthermore, remains of temples and fortifications have been found, as well as a number of urns, pillars, bronze objects, etc. The Sarsina cathedral was probably constructed around the years 1000-08, has been chosen as its official year of construction, so that there were festivities in 2008.Cattedrale Sarsina - SARSINA 1008 Ennio Morricone on 25 August 2008 conducted his newest composition Vuoto d'anima piena, a work for vocals, an orchestra of 40 and a choir of 60 persons, in the cathedral-basilica for the first time.

Œ±-Farnesene and Œ≤-farnesene are isomers, differing by the location of one double bond. Œ±-Farnesene is 3,7,11-trimethyl-1,3,6,10-dodecatetraene and Œ≤-farnesene is 7,11-dimethyl-3-methylene-1,6,10-dodecatriene. The alpha form can exist as four stereoisomers that differ about the geometry of two of its three internal double bonds (the stereoisomers of the third internal double bond are identical). The beta isomer exists as two stereoisomers about the geometry of its central double bond. Two of the Œ±-farnesene stereoisomers are reported to occur in nature. (E,E)-Œ±-Farnesene is the most common isomer. It is found in the coating of apples, and other fruits, and it is responsible for the characteristic green apple odour. Its oxidation by air forms compounds that are damaging to the fruit. The oxidation products injure cell membranes which eventually causes cell death in the outermost cell layers of the fruit, resulting in a storage disorder known as scald. (Z,E)-Œ±-Farnesene has been isolated from the oil of perilla. Both isomers are also insect semiochemicals; they act as alarm pheromones in termites or food attractants for the apple tree pest, the codling moth. Œ±-Farnesene is also the chief compound contributing to the scent of gardenia, making up ~65% of the headspace constituents. Œ≤-Farnesene has one naturally occurring isomer. The E isomer is a constituent of various essential oils. It is also released by aphids as an alarm pheremone upon death to warn away other aphids. Several plants, including potato species, have been shown to synthesize this pheromone as a natural insect repellent. == See also == * Farnesol * Nerolidol * Prenylation * Terpene == References == Category:Insect pheromones Category:Perfume ingredients Category:Sesquiterpenes Category:Polyenes ","title":"Farnesene"},{"id":"3254427","text":"Gavin Mitchell accepting David Bowie's induction into Barrowland Hall of Fame Gavin Mitchell (born 16 December 1964) is a Scottish actor and comedian, best known for playing Robert \\"Boaby the Barman\\" Taylor in the Scottish sitcom Still Game.

Richard Cartwright (February 2, 1759 ‚Äì July 27, 1815) was a businessman, judge and political figure in Upper Canada. ==Early life== Richard Cartwright was born at Albany, New York in 1759. His father, Richard Cartwright, had immigrated there from England in 1742. His mother, Joanne Beasley, was from a 'loyal Dutch family', and his father, an innkeeper and small landowner, soon became a pillar of the local community and was able to educate Richard privately. ==Family loyalty questioned== During the American Revolution his father tried to remain as neutral as possible in the now rebel- occupied Albany, but a letter from Richard was intercepted by the authorities in 1777; this showed his loyalty was not with the American Patriots. ==Departs for Canada== The younger Richard was allowed to leave for Quebec, but following his departure, now tainted by their son's loyalism to the Crown, his parents were abused and their property was 'destroyed and plundered', before they were 'conveyed away by guard to Crown Point' in 1778. At Fort Niagara, the young Cartwright found employment as secretary to John Butler, and took part in military expeditions with his Loyalist regiment into New York. He soon saw the potential profits in supplying the British army; in 1780 he ended his military career and formed a partnership with Robert Hamilton. ==Life at Kingston== In 1783, Cartwright moved from Carleton Island where he operated a trading post, and settled at nearby Cataraqui (now Kingston) where he continued his business endeavours. His business interests expanded to include importing and exporting goods, manufacturing, retailing, milling, shipbuilding, and land speculation. He was an early proponent of free trade with the United States. ==Political career== In 1788, he became a judge in the Court of Common Pleas and, in 1789, was named to the land board for the Mecklenburg District. He became a member of the Legislative Council for the province in 1792. He helped bring John Strachan to Upper Canada in 1792 to help improve educational facilities in the province. Unlike Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe, Cartwright believed that English institutions should be adapted to Upper Canada's needs, and he opposed encouraging Americans to immigrate to the province. He served as an officer in the militia during the War of 1812. Cartwright died in Kingston in 1815. ==Family== He was a cousin of politician and businessman Richard Beasley. In 1785 Cartwright married Magdalen Secord, from a well-known Loyalist family, sister-in-law of Laura Secord. His son, John Solomon, became a judge and political figure in the Province of Canada. His grandson, Sir Richard John Cartwright, became a Kingston lawyer and Canadian political figure. The former township of Cartwright in Durham County was named in his honour. ==References== *Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online Retrieved 2016-04-07 *Osborne, Brian S. and Donald Swainson.

It is served by the A train at all times and is the southern terminal for the C train at all times except nights. During nights, this is the northern terminal for the Lefferts Boulevard shuttle train from Ozone Park, Queens. Construction on the Euclid Avenue station started in 1938, but this part of the Fulton Street Line did not open until 1948. The Fulton Street Line was extended to the east in 1956, connecting to the Fulton Street Elevated via a branch line that runs through the Grant Avenue station. Elevators were installed at Euclid Avenue circa 2000. The station has four tracks and two island platforms. In terms of railroad directions, this is the southernmost station on the Fulton Street Line. The line was originally planned to extend further east as a four-track underground line; however, the four-track extension was never built. East of the station, there are connections to the Pitkin Yard as well as to the Fulton Street Elevated. The tracks themselves dead-end after the Fulton Street elevated spur diverges. ==History== Euclid Avenue was part of a four-station extension of the Fulton Street subway along Pitkin Avenue, past its original planned terminus at Broadway Junction. Construction of the extension began in 1938. Work on the section of the line between Crystal Street and Grant Avenue, which included the Euclid Avenue station and the Pitkin Yard, began in late 1940. On August 26, 1941, lightning from a severe thunderstorm damaged the temporary timber roofing over the construction site at Pitkin Avenue and Autumn Avenue just east of the station. The lighting also ruptured a gas main at the site creating a fire and causing damage to an adjacent building, while two automobiles fell into the exposed tunnel cavern. Construction of the extension was halted in December 1942 due to material shortages caused by World War II. At the time, the section of tunnel between Crystal Street and Grant Avenue was 96% complete. Other parts of the extension were more than 99% complete, but vital equipment had yet to be installed, precluding these stations' openings. Construction resumed on the extension in November 1946. The delay meant the station received different design features than the rest of the stations along the line, including a slightly different tiling, fluorescent lighting instead of then-standard incandescent lights, and improved restroom and phone booth facilities. The station also featured a then-modern interlocking technology, known as the \\"NX\\" system, wherein train operators would press buttons that automatically adjusted the corresponding switches. In older interlockings throughout the subway system, workers in a separate control tower had to manually adjust the switches using a series of levers within the tower. After several test runs, the station opened to the public in the early morning of November 28, 1948. It became the new terminal of the Fulton Street Line, replacing the former terminal at Broadway‚ÄìEast New York (now Broadway Junction). It later became the replacement for the elevated BMT Fulton Street Line's Chestnut Street and Crescent Street stations, which closed on April 26, 1956 when the connection to the eastern Fulton elevated was opened. In the mid-2000s, an elevator to the street and elevators between the mezzanine and each platform were installed, making the station ADA-accessible. ==Station layout== Street staircase The station has four tracks and two island platforms. It is the easternmost express station on the IND Fulton Street Line in terms of geographic directions. In terms of railroad directions, Euclid Avenue is the line's southernmost express station. It has the same 10\\" √ó 5\\" eggshell-beige wall tile as do the next three stations west, in contrast to the typical square white tiles seen in the rest of the IND. The tile band, however, is a delicate shade of lilac with a violet border, similar to Delancey Street in Manhattan. The I-beams are tiled with color bands and mini- vertical name tablets reading \\"Euclid,\\" along with the two-tone border motif. The I-beams are in pairs at the center of the platforms; towards each end the platforms narrow and there is a single row of these I-beams. A crew quarters room is over the railroad south end of both platforms. The station has a crossover in the mezzanine along with an active newsstand and elevators to both platforms. The station has a control tower at the eastern end of the southbound platform, which monitors trains between Broadway Junction and the station, and controls the interlockings east of Euclid Avenue. The tower was the first in the subway system to use the \\"NX\\" or \\"Entrance-Exit\\" system. In this system, the tower utilizes a wide, tall electric light signal board which features a diagram of the nearby stations and track layout. It operates on direct current and consists of simple knobs and push buttons to control track switches, as opposed to the previous system which ran on alternating current and required a complicated series of levers. ===Exits=== Stairways are present from each platform to the mezzanine above the tracks. Fare control is located in the mezzanine. Outside fare control is a street elevator leading to the northeast corner of Pitkin and Euclid Avenues. Street stairs also lead to all four corners of the intersection. * * The bus routes stop outside the station. ==East of the station== The next station east (railroad south) for IND Fulton Street service is Grant Avenue, located in City Line, Brooklyn. However, an unfinished station is rumored to exist at 76th Street in nearby Ozone Park, Queens, just four blocks east of Grant Avenue. Express tracks The site of the planned station at 76th Street in Ozone Park, Queens The track work near Euclid Avenue is intricate, allowing trains to enter the Pitkin Yard from both the express and local tracks (where C trains relay to get from the southbound to the northbound local track), and with connections to the two- track Grant Avenue station from both the express and local tracks; the Grant Avenue spur then veers northeast towards Liberty Avenue. All four mainline tracks continue below the Grant Avenue connection, used only to store trains, east under Pitkin Avenue until approximately Eldert Lane (just south of the Grant Avenue station). It was planned that these tracks would continue under Pitkin Avenue to Cross Bay Boulevard, as part of a never-built system expansion which would have extended the Fulton Street Subway to the Rockaways and to Cambria Heights near the Queens-Nassau County border. On the electric light signal board in the control room at Euclid Avenue, there is a taped-over section of the board that hides the 76th Street station. There are also two tracks coming from the Pitkin Yard heading towards the planned 76th Street station site. These tracks would have merged with the mainline tracks just before 76th Street station. When Pitkin Yard originally opened, the yard leads toward 76th Street were usable to relay short trains on. Today, those two tracks are no longer connected via switches. Parts of the trackways still exist, but the switches were removed and the tunnel ends in a cinderblock wall. As late as 1951, the mainline and relay tracks were still planned to be extended as far as 105th Street (the modern location of Aqueduct Racetrack), with a connection to the then-recently abandoned Rockaway Beach Branch of the Long Island Rail Road east of Cross Bay Boulevard. The extension of the subway, however, was never built; instead the line was connected to the former Fulton Street elevated on Liberty Avenue and the former LIRR Rockaway branch (now the IND Rockaway Line), both via the Grant Avenue station, which opened in 1956. Rumors that the proposed station was actually constructed, at least partially, are prevalent. Evidence supporting the existence of the station includes the signal board, the cinderblock wall at the end of the tunnel (cinderblock, brick, and wooden partitions are used in other parts of the subway to seal potential expansion sites) and several signals for trains running from the station into Euclid Avenue facing the wall, including one directly in front of the wall. On online transit forums, such as the website SubChat, some have claimed to have known people who have seen the station. The New York Times, referring to the rumor as the \\"transit Atlantis\\", has likened it to the Roswell UFO incident or the Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories. Steve Krokowski, a retired transit worker and police officer, was quoted by the Times in reference to the station, mentioning: * The taped-over portion of the signal board which covers a label for the 76th Street station. (This control board actually exists, and has indeed been taped over.) * The remnants of the Pitkin Yard leads that head northeast and then stop near the aforementioned cinder-block wall. Krokowski tried to dig under the wall, and found a track tie, but stopped when the hole caved in. * A retired police officer claimed that the cinder-block wall previously had a door, and that in the 1960s he walked through it, and saw a station complete with everything except for turnstiles and token booths. Other \\"colleagues\\", all supposedly dead, also claimed to have seen the station, though whether anyone else actually made such claims is unknown. However, there is also significant evidence against the existence of the station, including a lack of newspaper coverage, the lack of subway infrastructure such as ventilation grates or skylights on Pitkin Avenue in the area, and the absence of documentation of the work from the Board of Transportation or the Board of Estimate. == References == == External links == * * Station Reporter ‚Äî C train * Station Reporter ‚Äî A Lefferts * Station Reporter ‚Äî A Rockaway * The Subway Nut ‚Äî Euclid Avenue Pictures * Euclid Avenue entrance from Google Maps Street View * Platforms from Google Maps Street View Category:IND Fulton Street Line stations Category:New York City Subway stations in Brooklyn Category:New York City Subway terminals Category:New York City Subway stations located underground Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1948 Category:East New York, Brooklyn Category:1948 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Euclid Avenue station (IND Fulton Street Line)"},{"id":"3254500","text":"Michael Weiss may refer to: ==Sports== * Michael Weiss (triathlete) (born 1981), Austrian triathlete and cyclist * Michael Weiss (figure skater) (born 1976), American former figure skater * Michael Wei√ü (football manager) (born 1965), German association football coach * Michael Weiss (swimmer) (born 1991), American swimmer ==Other== * Michael Weiss (pianist) (born 1958), pianist, composer * Michael T.

However, in Galileo images it is hard to tell where the volcano is. One would suspect that this would mean that it was inactive.

It is a member of the ergoline family and chemically similar to LSD, ergine, ergometrine, and lysergic acid. Due to its oxytocic properties, it has a medical use in obstetrics. According to Jonathan Ott, methylergonovine has LSD-like actions above 2 milligrams, due to its agonistic action at the 5HT2A-mGlu2 receptor protomers. Clinical efficacy occurs around 200 ¬µg, ten times lower than the hallucinogenic threshold. Methylergometrine maleate is marketed under the trade name Methergine. ==Uses== ===Obstetric use=== Methylergometrine is a smooth muscle constrictor that mostly acts on the uterus. It is most commonly used to prevent or control excessive bleeding following childbirth and spontaneous or elective abortion, and also to aid in expulsion of retained products of conception after a missed abortion (miscarriage in which all or part of the fetus remains in the uterus) and to help deliver the placenta after childbirth. It is available as tablets or injection (IM or IV) or in liquid form to be taken orally. ===Migraine=== Methylergometrine is sometimes used for both prevention and acute treatment of migraine. It is an active metabolite of methysergide. ==Contraindications== Methylergometrine is contraindicated in patients with hypertension and pre- eclampsia. It is also contraindicated in HIV positive patients taking protease inhibitors, delavirdine and efavirenz (which is also an agonist at the 5HT2A-mGlu2 receptor protomer and increases the chances of a patient experiencing hallucinations during methylergometrine therapy). ==Side effects== Adverse effects include: * Cholinergic effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea * Dizziness * Pulmonary hypertension * Coronary artery vasoconstriction * Severe systemic hypertension (especially in patients with pre-eclampsia) * Convulsions In excessive doses, methylergometrine can also lead to cramping, respiratory depression and coma. == Interactions == Methylergometrine likely interacts with drugs that inhibit the liver enzyme CYP3A4, such as azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics and many HIV drugs. It can also increase constriction of blood vessels caused by sympathomimetic drugs and other ergot alkaloids. ==Mechanism of action== Methylergometrine is a partial agonist/antagonist on serotonergic, dopaminergic and alpha- adrenergic receptors. Its specific binding and activation pattern on these receptors leads to a highly, if not completely, specific contraction of smooth uterus muscle via 5-HT2A serotonin receptors, while blood vessels are affected to a lesser extent compared to other ergot alkaloids. == See also == * Ergometrine == References == Category:Lysergamides ","title":"Methylergometrine"},{"id":"3254536","text":"Claude Janiak Claude Janiak (born 30 October 1948) is a Swiss politician of Polish origin, lawyer and President of the Swiss National Council for the 2005/2006 term.

Individuals within this group included Francis Place (1771‚Äì1854), George Grote (1794‚Äì1871), Joseph Parkes (1796‚Äì1865), John Arthur Roebuck (1802‚Äì1879), Charles Buller (1806‚Äì1848), John Stuart Mill (1806‚Äì1873), Edward John Trelawny (1792‚Äì1881), and William Molesworth (1810‚Äì1855). Several became Radical members of Parliament, and the group as a whole attempted to use the Westminster Review to exert influence on public opinion. They rejected any philosophical or legal naturalism and furthered Jeremy Bentham's utilitarian philosophy. Utilitarianism as a moral philosophy argues that maximizing happiness should be the moral standard by which our actions should be measured. It thereby stands in contrast to the rationalistic ethics of Immanuel Kant as well as to the convictions of idealism, amongst others. ==Background== Born in the first half of the eighteenth century, Bentham proved a conduit for enlightenment ideas to reach nineteenth century Britain.D Daiches, ed., Companion to Literature 1 (1969) p. 44-5 A disciple of Helvetius,E Hal√©vy, The Liberal Awakening (London 1961) p. 31 who saw all society as based on the wants and desires of the individual,G Berereton, A Short History of French Literature (Penguin 1954) p. 99 Bentham began with a belief in reform through enlightened despotism, before becoming a philosophical radical and supporter of universal suffrage,D Daiches, ed., Companion to Literature 1 (1969) p. 45 (though without ever losing his belief in the positive power of the state). G. M. Trevelyan considered that ‚ÄúParliamentary, municipal, scholastic, ecclesiastical, economic reform all sprang from the spirit of Bentham‚Äôs perpetual enquiry, ‚Äòwhat is the use of it?‚Äô - his universal shibboleth‚Äù.G M Trevelyan, British History in the Nineteenth Century (London 1922) p. 182 ==Peak Activity== The philosophical radicals, as a group, came to prominence in the 1820s. When radicalism re- emerged from the defeat of the Six Acts, it was (in Elie Hal√©vy‚Äôs words) ‚Äúthe Radicalism ‚Äì respectable, middle-class, prosaic, and calculating ‚Äì of Bentham and his followers‚Äù.E Hal√©vy, The Liberal Awakening (London 1961) p. 189 Central to their political aims was the reduction of aristocratic power, privilege and abuse. In his article in the opening number of the Westminster Review, James Mill dissected the aristocratic nature of the British Constitution, the House of Commons largely nominated by some hundred borough- managers, the landlord culture propped up by the Law and the Church.J S Mill, Autobiography (Penguin 1989) p. 85-6 His son veered in many respects from his views, but never ceased (in his own words) to consider ‚Äúthe predominance of the aristocratic classes, the noble and the rich, in the English Constitution, an evil worth any struggle to get rid of‚Äù.J S Mill, Autobiography (Penguin 1989) p. 136 Some of their remedies ‚Äì universal suffrage; the ballot ‚Äì would a century later have become taken-for-granted realities of British life; others ‚Äì abolition of the monarchy and the House of Lords; disestablishment of the Church of EnglandE Hal√©vy, The Triumph of Reform (London 1961) p. 64-9 \\\\- never materialised. Alongside their political radicalism, the group shared a liberal view of political economy influenced by David Ricardo,E Hal√©vy, The Liberal Awakening (London 1961) p. 193 and favouring laissez faire;G M Trevelyan, British History in the Nineteenth Century (London 1922) p. 183 while codification and centralisation also formed component elements (not always compatible with laissez faire) of the Benthamite creed. ==Later developments== By the second half of the 19thC, much of the philosophical radicals‚Äô program had been realised, much had become to be seen as inadequate ‚Äì aristocratic privilege no longer appearing as the central social problematic.J. Harvey, John Henry Muirhead (2013) Setting out ‚Äúto free philosophical radicalism from the reproach of sectarian Benthamism‚Äù,J S Mill, Autobiography (Penguin 1989) p. 164 J. S.

It remains a separate ecclesiastical parish. Radipole stands at the head of, and is named after, the lake, now an RSPB nature reserve, into which the River Wey flows, and which leads into Weymouth Harbour. Until 1984 it had Radipole railway station on the South Western Main Line and Heart of Wessex Line out of Weymouth. There is some evidence of prehistoric occupation, and it is believed that the Romans had a small port or landing stage at the head of the lake. A Romano-British burial site was found nearby when the upper playing field of Southill Primary School was constructed. A Roman road runs from Radipole to Dorchester (the former Durnovaria), and indeed still forms by far the greater part of the line of the present road between Weymouth and Dorchester. The parish of Radipole predates by centuries the borough of Melcombe Regis, which grew up on its wastes on an exposed spit of shingle by the sea in the 12th century. The church of St Ann was the mother church of Melcombe Regis until 1606. The church is distinguished for its triple bellcote, consisting of a single arch above double arches. A daughter church, St Aldhelm's, was built in 1939‚Äì41. St Ann's Church, Radipole, as seen from nearby Southill. The old Manor House lies behind the church. In the last decades Radipole has experienced suburbanisation and accompanying road-building, as nearby Weymouth has expanded northwards. However the centre of the old village still remains. The attractive architectural group formed by the church and the manor house is well known locally. The field known as Humpty-Dumpty Field immediately to the south of the churchyard, on the slope leading down to the head of the lake, is supposed once to have covered the site of the lost mediaeval village, and possibly even Roman remains, but any such evidence was destroyed by the action of the then landowner. ==References== * Dorset (The Buildings of England), by John Newman and Nikolaus Pevsner.

His father Leo Phokas the Younger was a curopalates and brother to the Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas. Even as a young man, Bardas gained a reputation for his great expertise in the science of war: If his military career was quick to peak, it was even quicker to collapse. Upon his uncle's death in 969, Phokas and his family rebelled against the new emperor and their own cousin, John I Tzimiskes. Bardas was proclaimed emperor by troops stationed at Caesarea, but their rebellion was extinguished by another skilled commander, Bardas Skleros. Phokas and his relatives were captured and exiled to the island of Chios, where he would spend the following seven years. == Phokas versus Skleros == Clash between the armies of Skleros and Phokas, miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes. In 978 Bardas was delivered from his prison cell by the eunuch Basil Lekapenos, Basil II's uncle and de facto regent. He was dispatched in disguise to his native Cappadocia to stir up the local aristocracy against Skleros, who had revolted against imperial authorities and advanced to the Hellespont. Despite several initial setbacks, and with the assistance of a Georgian army led by Tornikios, Phokas eventually suppressed the revolt, gaining victory in single combat with Skleros. For his vital services to the crown, he was rewarded with a coveted office of Domestic of the Scholae and at once led the Byzantine armies to reconquer Aleppo from the Saracens. Later, to quote Psellos, \\"he was given the privilege of a triumph and took his place among the personal friends of his sovereign.\\" == Second rebellion == While Constantine VIII was easily swayed by his advisers, his brother Basil II was apparently irked by their supremacy. Basil's energy showed that he was determined to take the administration into his own hands and personally control the army. His growing independence alarmed both Basil Lekapenos and Phokas. In 987 they entered into secret negotiations with their former enemy, Skleros, on the understanding that the empire would be partitioned if they succeeded in their revolt against the emperors. In a campaign that curiously mimicked Skleros' revolt a decade earlier, Phokas proclaimed himself emperor and overran most of Asia Minor. \\"It was no longer in imagination, but in very truth, that he put on the imperial robes, with the emperor's crown and the royal insignia of purple\\", says Psellos. After relegating his colleague Skleros to a prison, Phokas proceeded to lay siege to Abydos, thus threatening to blockade the Dardanelles. At this point Basil II obtained timely aid, in the form of Varangian mercenaries, from his brother-in-law Vladimir, the Rus prince of Kiev, and marched to Abydos.The Earliest Mediaeval Churches of Kiev, Samuel H. Cross, H. V. Morgilevski and K. J. Conant, Speculum, Vol. 11, No. 4 (Oct., 1936), 479. The two armies were facing each other, when Phokas galloped forward, seeking personal combat with the Emperor who was riding in front of the lines. Just as he prepared to charge at Basil, however, Phokas suffered a seizure, fell from his horse, and was found to be dead (April 13, 989). His head was cut off and brought to Basil. This ended the rebellion. == Family == By his marriage to a cousin, one Adralestina, Bardas left two sons, Leo and Nikephoros (died 1022). His grandson and namesake, Bardas Phokas, was blinded by imperial authorities in 1025. It is believed that the Cretan family of the Phokades descends from him. == References == ==Notes== Category:Byzantine generals Category:Byzantine usurpers Category:10th-century Byzantine people Category:989 deaths Bardas 02 Category:Generals of Basil II Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Domestics of the Schools ","title":"Bardas Phokas the Younger"},{"id":"3254581","text":"Robert Hamilton (September 14, 1753 ‚Äì March 8, 1809) was a businessman, judge and political figure in Upper Canada.

They are found in Eastern Asia, ranging from the Russian Far East in the north to Vietnam in the south, with the highest species richness in China. Some species are widespread and common, but others have relatively small ranges and are threatened. Depending on species, they inhabit coastal marine, brackish or fresh water habitats, and some are anadromous, only visiting fresh water to spawn. ==Appearance and life cycle== They are slender, have translucent or transparent bodies and almost no scales (females are entirely scale-less, while males have a few). The head is strongly depressed and has numerous teeth. The adults are believed to be neotenic, retaining some larval features. For example, the skeleton is not fully ossified, consisting largely of cartilage. They are small fish, typically around long; only a few reach , and the largest species no more than . Icefish rapidly reach maturity, have a high fecundity and typically only live one year. Some species live in the same habitat throughout their lives, but other visit specific habitats, like rivers, estuaries or the surf zone, to lay their eggs. In at least Salangichthys microdon there are both populations that are resident and populations that are anadromous. ==As food and introduced species== Sushi in Japan with Salangichthys microdon Icefish support important fisheries and are eaten in East Asia, often after being dried or cooked. They are also exported to southern Europe for use as a replacement for the more expensive transparent goby, a Mediterranean species used in the local cuisine. Because of their value as food fish, there have been many attempts of introducing icefish (especially certain Neosalanx and Protosalanx) to regions in East Asia where not native. Most attempts failed, but several were successful, and in some cases the icefish rapidly multiplied and became the most common fish in their new habitat. Feeding on planktonic crustaceans and tiny fish, they have outcompeted certain native fish like Anabarilius grahami, which have become rare and threatened. ==See also== * Sundasalanx, the Sundaland noodlefish, which formerly were included in Salangidae, but now are placed in their own family ==References== Category:Fish of Asia Category:Ray-finned fish families ","title":"Salangidae"},{"id":"3254611","text":"Blogging Tories is the name of a group of Canadian bloggers who come from the centre, centre-right, right-wing and libertarian sides of the political spectrum.

They captured five castles in the north of Ceredigion then later in the year launched a second invasion, inflicting a heavy defeat on the Normans at the Battle of Crug Mawr, just outside Cardigan. In 1137 they captured Carmarthen. He later married Richard Fitz Gilbert de Clare's daughter Alice (Adelize) de Clare and had issue with her. Gruffudd ap Cynan died in 1137 and was succeeded by Owain Gwynedd, his eldest surviving son. Cadwaladr was given lands in northern Ceredigion. Cadwaladr joined with Ranulph, Earl of Chester in the attack on Lincoln in 1141, when King Stephen of England was taken prisoner. This alliance was probably linked to Cadwaladr's marriage to Alice de Clare, daughter of Richard Fitz Gilbert de Clare. In 1143 Cadwaladr's men killed Anarawd ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth by treachery, apparently on Cadwaladr's orders. Owain Gwynedd responded by sending his son Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd to deprive Cadwaladr of his lands in Ceredigion. Cadwaladr fled to Ireland where he hired a fleet from √ìttar the Norse-Gael king of Dublin and landed at Abermenai in 1144 in an attempt to force Owain to return his lands. Cadwaladr apparently abandoned or escaped from his allies and made peace with his brother, who obliged the Dubliners to leave. In 1147 Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd and his brother Cynan drove Cadwaladr from his remaining lands in Meirionnydd. A further quarrel with his brother Owain led to Cadwaladr being driven into exile in England, where King Henry II later gave him lands at Hess in Shropshire. ==Henry II's time== When Henry II invaded Gwynedd in 1157 the terms of the peace agreement between him and Owain Gwynedd included the stipulation that Cadwaladr should be given back his lands. From this time on Cadwaladr was careful to cooperate closely with his brother, helping him to capture Rhuddlan and Prestatyn castles in 1167. Cadwaladr survived his brother by two years, dying in 1172. He was buried alongside Owain in Bangor Cathedral. ==Children== Cadwaladr had seven sons with three different wives. With his first wife Gwerfel ferch Gwrgan, he had: *Cadfan ap Cadwaladr With his second wife Alice de Clare, he had: *Cunedda ap Cadwaladr *Rhicert ap Cadwaladr *Ralph ap Cadwaladr With his third wife Tangwystl,Burke, p. 43. he had: *Cadwgan ap Cadwaladr *Maredudd ap Cadwaladr *Cadwallon ap Cadwaladr ==Fiction== Cadwaladr's attempt to reclaim his lands with the help of a Danish fleet in 1144 forms the background to The Summer of the Danes by Ellis Peters in the Brother Cadfael series. He also appears in the Sarah Woodbury 'Gareth and Gwen Medieval Mystery Series' of books. ==Notes== === Sources === * * *John Burke, Sir Bernard Burke (1850) A genealogical and heraldic dictionary of the landed gentry of Great Britain.

This large village is served by the A48 road, and lies less than one mile from Junction 37 of the M4 motorway, and is therefore only a half-hour journey from the capital city of Wales, Cardiff; in fact it lies approximately equidistant between the capital (Cardiff) and the second city (Swansea). The nearest town is the seaside resort of Porthcawl. Within the Community, to the northeast of Pyle, is the adjoining settlement of Kenfig Hill, North Cornelly also adjoins Pyle and the built-up area had a population of 13,701 in 2011. https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W37000111 ==Etymology== The English name \\"Pyle\\" is derived from the Welsh P√Æl, meaning a tidal inlet of the sea, this localised toponym is found along the coast of South Wales, from Pembrokeshire and into Somerset. In this instance it may refer to the mouth of the River Kenfig, which is tidal for its first mile from the sea. A commonly stated, but erroneous derivation from the English word \\"pile\\" (a stake) is highly unlikely, with the only settlement in the United Kingdom known to have this derivation being a hamlet on the Isle of Wight. ==Location== Pyle is located approximately twenty miles west of Cardiff, four miles west of Bridgend and six mile southeast of Port Talbot. It is on the main A48 road from Cardiff to Swansea and is just north of the M4 motorway which has superseded the trunk road for through traffic. Junction 37 on the motorway is one mile south of Pyle. Other communities in the vicinity are South Cornelly, North Cornelly, Kenfig and Porthcawl. Pyle railway station is on the Cardiff to Swansea section of the London to South Wales Main Line. according to certain sources cowbridge now also borders Pyle ==Early history== An indication of early settlement is the Croes Siencyn Incised Stone, a Scheduled monument on Marlas Road, (, grid ref: SS822823). This is a weathered stone with an incised cross, dated to 11th or 12th century, moved to its present garden location in 1945 from 'between Kenfig and Pyle'.coflein NPRN: 301402. Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust (search for PRN: 00141m). Cadw SAM: GM036: Pyle Incised Stone The early expansion of Pyle was brought about when the ancient borough of Kenfig was abandoned after being overwhelmed by sand during a catastrophic encroachment by the sea in the mid fifteenth- century. The road through Kenfig was diverted one and a half miles inland and brought Pyle to prominence while Kenfig dwindled into a straggle of a few houses. The walls of Pyle St James' parish church are reputed to have been moved stone by stone from the old town, relocated further inland as the sand encroached. This gave rise to the church sometimes being referred to as the upside-down church, because the first stones moved would have been the higher ones in the original church. Writing in 1870, in the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales, John Marius Wilson described the parish of Pyle, including Kenfig and Skerr, to comprise of land and of water. In 1861, the population of the village was 1,192 distributed among 251 households. Real property in the village of Pyle was valued at ¬£3,949, of which ¬£1,619 was in mines. Besides the thriving collieries there were also coking plants and ironworks as well as a quarry where good quality building stone was extracted. ==Recent history== The street of Longlands Close in Pyle was the site of a coaching inn which was used by passing travelers using the west Wales to London turnpike. Lord Nelson stayed at Pyle Inn on his way to visit to naval installations in Pembrokeshire, as did Isambard Kingdom Brunel during the construction of the Great Western Railway line through South Wales. Pyle was made a community in 2002, when the Cynffig community was split into two parts (the other being Cornelly), following a recommendation of the Local Government Boundary Commission for Wales.See: Boundary commission for Wales See: Welsh Statutory Instrument 2002 No. 1129 (W.117): The Bridgend (Cynffig, Cornelly and Pyle Communities) (Electoral Changes) Order 2002 ==Governance== Pyle is the name of the electoral ward which is coterminous with the community. The ward elects three county councillors to Bridgend County Borough Council. ==Village facilities== The village has its own leisure centre, swimming pool, supermarket, library and petrol station. The leisure centre is a frequent school trip destination, attracting schools from the Cardiff area. There is also a large industrial estate which hosts some notable names and a garden centre. An area of woodland known as The Collwyn is close to the west side of the village. In 2010 Pyle Community Council were able to buy the strip of woodland, with its stream and old watermill, to ensure its survival and use for the village. There are three schools in the community: Cynffig Comprehensive School, Mynydd Cynffig Primary School and Pil Primary School. Pyle Rugby Football Club plays in the WRU Swalec League Division 3. ==Religion== Kenfig Hill, though a smaller settlement, has four places of worship. St Theodore's (Church in Wales), was built in 1889, and became a parish in 1923.History of St Theodore, Kenfig Hill Also in Kenfig Hill are Pisgah Chapel, (Welsh Baptist), Bethal Community Church and St Joseph's Church (Roman Catholic).Pyle community council: Places of worship Accessed 13 May 2013 Within Pyle itself there is Mount Zion Chapel (English Baptist) and the parish church of St James (Church in Wales) is a Grade I listed building. It was built in around 1471 as is indicated by a carving of the figures on a small wooden shield on a wallplate. It is unclear to what extent the present building adheres to the original structure because there are variations in construction methods and in the stone used. The church is considered to be a fine example of a mainly Perpendicular, two-cell church with a nave and chancel. The tower at the west end bears a clock. ==See also== *List of Scheduled Monuments in Bridgend ==References== ==External links== *community- council.org.uk/pyle *www.geograph.co.uk : photos of Pyle and surrounding area Category:Villages in Bridgend County Borough Category:Communities in Bridgend County Borough Category:Wards of Bridgend County Borough ","title":"Pyle"},{"id":"3254643","text":"Nakano Station (‰∏≠ÈáéÈßÖ; Nakano Eki) is the name of three train stations in Japan. * Nakano Station (Gunma) in Midori, Gunma Prefecture * Nakano Station (Nagano) in Ueda, Nagano Prefecture * Nakano Station (Tokyo) in Nakano, Tokyo Other similarly named stations include: * Aki-Nakano Station in Aki-ku, Hiroshima, Hiroshima Prefecture * Kazusa-Nakano Station in Otaki, Isumi District, Chiba Prefecture * Rikuchu-Nakano Station in Kunohe District, Iwate Prefecture * Shinsh≈´-Nakano Station in Nakano, Nagano Prefecture * Nakano Sakaue Station Station formerly called Nakano Station (ÂêçÈ¶ôÈáéÈßÖ): * Nishitetsu Chihaya Station in Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture ","title":"Nakano Station"},{"id":"3254646","text":"Deganwy railway station serves the small town of Deganwy, Wales, and is the only intermediate station located on the Llandudno branch line from Llandudno Junction (on the North Wales Coast Line from Crewe to Holyhead) to Llandudno. ==History== The station was built by the London and North Western Railway in 1866 together with adjacent wharfs on the Conwy Estuary to which it was planned to bring dressed slate from Blaenau Ffestiniog for export by sea.

It is their first to feature a majority of clean vocals, sung by new vocalist Pasi Koskinen. The music and lyrics are inspired by the traditional Finnish ballads and poems compiled in the Kanteletar by Elias L√∂nnrot in 1840. The primary genre of the album is progressive metal, with strong folk influence, as well as elements of melodic death metal and heavy metal. Many of the album's tracks, e.g. \\"Against Widows\\", have become fan favorites and have been performed in concerts since Elegy's release. In 2004, Relapse Records reissued Elegy as a digipak, featuring four live bonus tracks.

Recorded near the end of Sinatra's career, it consists of electronically assembled duets between Sinatra and younger singers from various genres. The album was a commercial success, debuting at No. 2 on the Billboard albums chart, reaching No. 5 in the UK, and selling over 3 million copies in the US. It is the only Sinatra album to date to achieve triple platinum certification. The album received mixed critical notices, with complaints stemming from Sinatra's specified style of isolated performance wherein he was never joined by his duet partners in the studio, an artificial method of record production which lacked the elements of personal collaboration and spontaneity. The guest singers had been directed to sing along to his pre-recorded vocal parts, and to make their performances complement his. The cover art displays a specially commissioned painting of Frank Sinatra by LeRoy Neiman. Its sequel, Duets II, was released the following year. Both albums were packaged together in a \\"90th Birthday Limited Collector's Edition\\" released in 2005; North American pressings add an unreleased duet recording of \\"My Way\\" with Willie Nelson, while international pressings have him singing with Luciano Pavarotti. ==Production== Sinatra was approached in 1992 with the idea of making an album of duets. Phil Ramone, Sinatra's manager Eliot Weisman and the Capitol executive producer Don Rubin discussed the details at Sinatra's house in Palm Springs, California. Ramone felt that Sinatra's classic songs would be brought to new, younger listeners by way of the Duets project.Ramone 2007, pp. 6, 52 For duet partners, Sinatra suggested Ella Fitzgerald but she was not well enough to participate. Other artists, younger than Sinatra, were put on the list of potential partners. Sinatra specified that the duet partners must not be in the studio when he was singing his part. The project was pushed forward by Charles Koppelman, the CEO of EMI Records Group North America. An orchestra was rehearsed at Capitol Records Studio A in Los Angeles, where Sinatra had recorded many times, the orchestra using classic Nelson Riddle arrangements. Sinatra showed up for the first two days of intended tracking sessions but begged off laying down any vocals, the first day because he did not like being isolated in a vocal booth as intended by recording engineer Al Schmitt. On the second day, Hank Cattaneo (Co-Producer), suggested to Ramone, Schmitt and Pat Williams, that they create a small elevated stage set-up for Sinatra to stand on, and to place Bill Miller and his piano adjacent to Frank within the open- air stage/booth to make the recording session feel more like a live performance. However, Sinatra said his voice was not in optimal condition. At this point, about $350,000 had been spent to put the project together. Ramone and Capitol were worried the record would never be completed. Ramone spoke to Hank Cattaneo, his co-producer, about his concern. It was suggested that since Cattaneo was Frank's production manager and close friend, that he stay near Frank to assist in the sequence of songs and detail to Frank when the takes were acceptable and a retake was not required. Cattaneo further suggested to Ramone and Schmitt, that they record with the wireless microphones that Frank was accustomed to using in live performances. Nine songs were recorded in five hours, beginning with \\"Come Fly with Me\\". The various duet partners were invited to participate remotely, their recordings sent to Capitol by way of ISDN digital telephone lines connected by EDnet to the digital recording equipment. Bono and Aretha Franklin asked that Ramone fly out to appear in person at their local studios to strengthen the connection to Sinatra and the project. Bono recorded his part to \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" while standing on a couch in the STS Studios control room in Dublin, singing into a handheld microphone.Ramone 2007, p. 89 After Franklin recorded her part to \\"What Now My Love\\" in Detroit, she recorded a personal message to Sinatra, thanking him for the opportunity. The duet of ‚ÄúMy Way‚Äù with Luciano Pavarotti was not recorded in time to make the primary release of Sinatra‚Äôs Duets. It was placed on the Sinatra 80 album and then added to subsequent pressings of Duets as a bonus track addition. Hank Cattaneo produced and recorded this segment in Pavarotti‚Äôs summer villa in Pesaro, Italy. Don Rubin was in attendance at the recording session.Ramone 2007, p. 264 ==Release== The album was advertised as \\"The Recording Event of The Decade\\".

The European Tour sanctions several events in Asia, and has made a particular effort to expand its coverage in the Chinese market. ==Winners== {class= style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" !Year!!Tour!!Winner!!Score!!To par!!Margin of victory!!Runner(s)-up!!Venue -  align=center2020  ASA, EUR  colspan=\\"5\\" align=\\"center\\" Tournament postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic  Genzon GC -  align=center2019  ASA, EUR  Mikko Korhonen align=\\"center\\" 268  align=center‚àí20  Playoff  Benjamin H√©bert Genzon GC -  align=center2018  ASA, EUR  Alexander Bj√∂rk align=\\"center\\" 270  align=center‚àí18  1 stroke  Adri√°n Otaegui  Topwin G&CC; -  align=center2017  EUR, ONE  Alexander L√©vy (2) align=\\"center\\" 271  align=center‚àí17  Playoff  Dylan Frittelli  Topwin G&CC; -  align=center2016  EUR, ONE  Li Haotong align=\\"center\\" 266  align=center‚àí22  3 strokes  Felipe Aguilar Topwin G&CC; -  align=center2015  EUR, ONE  Wu Ashun align=\\"center\\" 279  align=center‚àí9  1 stroke  David Howell Tomson Shanghai Pudong GC -  align=center2014  EUR, ONE  Alexander L√©vy align=\\"center\\" 269  align=center‚àí19  4 strokes  Tommy Fleetwood Genzon GC -  align=center2013  EUR, ONE  Brett Rumford align=\\"center\\" 272  align=center‚àí16  4 strokes  Mikko Ilonen Binhai Lake GC -  align=center2012  EUR, ONE  Branden Grace align=\\"center\\" 267  align=center‚àí21  3 strokes  Nicolas Colsaerts Binhai Lake GC -  align=center2011  EUR, ONE  Nicolas Colsaerts align=\\"center\\" 264  align=center‚àí24  4 strokes  S√∏ren Kjeldsen Peter Lawrie Danny Lee Pablo Mart√≠n Luxehills Int‚Äôl CC -  align=center2010  EUR, ONE  Yang Yong-eun align=\\"center\\" 273  align=center‚àí15  2 strokes  Rhys Davies Stephen Dodd Suzhou Jinji Lake GC -  align=center2009  EUR, ONE  Scott Strange align=\\"center\\" 280  align=center‚àí8  1 stroke  Gonzalo Fern√°ndez-Casta√±o Beijing CBD Int‚Äôl GC -  align=center2008  ASA, EUR  Damien McGrane align=\\"center\\" 278  align=center‚àí10  9 strokes  Simon Griffiths Mike Lorenzo-Vera Oliver Wilson Beijing CBD Int‚Äôl GC -  align=center2007  ASA, EUR  Markus Brier align=\\"center\\" 274  align=center‚àí10  5 strokes  Scott Hend Graeme McDowell Andrew McLardy Shanghai Silport GC -  align=center2006  ASA, EUR  Jeev Milkha Singh align=\\"center\\" 278  align=center‚àí10  1 stroke  Gonzalo Fern√°ndez-Casta√±o Beijing Honghua Int‚Äôl GC -  align=center2005  ASA, EUR  Paul Casey align=\\"center\\" 275  align=center‚àí13  Playoff  Oliver Wilson Shenzhen GC -  align=center2004  ASA, EUR  Stephen Dodd align=\\"center\\" 276  align=center‚àí12  3 strokes  Thomas Bj√∏rn Shanghai Silport GC -  align=center2003  ASA  Zhang Lianwei align=\\"center\\" 277  align=center‚àí11  2 strokes  Thaworn Wiratchant Shanghai Silport GC -  align=center2002  ASA  David Gleeson align=\\"center\\" 272  align=center‚àí16  1 stroke  Pablo Del Olmo Shanghai Silport GC -  align=center2001  ASA  Charlie Wi align=\\"center\\" 272  align=center‚àí16  1 stroke  Thongchai Jaidee Shanghai Silport GC -  align=center2000  ASA  Simon Dyson align=\\"center\\" 275  align=center‚àí13  1 stroke  Jyoti Randhawa Shanghai Silport GC -  align=center1999  ASA  Kyi Hla Han align=\\"center\\" 273  align=center‚àí15  7 strokes  Christian Pena Shanghai Silport GC -  align=center1998  ASA  Ed Fryatt align=\\"center\\" 269  align=center‚àí19  2 strokes  Takeshi Ohyama Shanghai Sun Island Int‚Äôl GC -  align=center1997  ASA  Cheng Jun align=\\"center\\" 280  align=center‚àí8  5 strokes  Adrian Percey Beijing International GC -  align=center1996  ASA  Prayad Marksaeng align=\\"center\\" 269  align=center‚àí19  9 strokes  Hsieh Yu-shu Beijing International GC -  align=center1995   Ra√∫l Fretes align=\\"center\\" 277  align=center‚àí11  3 strokes  Lai Ying-juh Beijing International GC } ==References== ==External links== * *Coverage on the European Tour's official site *Coverage on the Asian Tour's official site Category:European Tour events Category:Asian Tour events Category:Golf tournaments in China Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1995 Category:1995 establishments in China ","title":"Volvo China Open"},{"id":"3254688","text":"'''''' Class 95 is an English radio station of Mediacorp Radio in Singapore.

It is a concept album, the lyrics are based on the Finnish national epic, Kalevala. While still predominantly death metal, the album shows a greater influence of doom metal than the band's debut, along with more melodic, heavy metal-inspired riffing and elements of progressive rock and traditional Finnish folk music. The album also introduced synthesizers and clean vocals to the band's sound, though the latter was used sparingly. This is the first Amorphis release to have an official keyboardist, Kasper M√•rtenson, as any previous of the band's releases had the band's own drummer, Jan Rechberger, provide the empty keyboardist role until the band decided to have a keyboardist and also to find one being M√•rtenson. With M√•rtenson in the band, it is the first time the band's original lineup changed by having an additional member. The album was an influential release in the development of the melodic death metal and folk metal genres. The original limited version (on digipack) had a cover of \\"Light My Fire\\" by The Doors added as a bonus track. It was later re-released in 2001 with most tracks from the Black Winter Day EP and the \\"Light My Fire\\" cover added as bonus tracks. ==Track listing== ===Bonus tracks=== Tracks 11‚Äì13 added from the Black Winter Day EP; track 14 is a bonus track: ==Credits== ===Band members=== * Tomi Koivusaari ‚Äì vocals, rhythm guitar * Esa Holopainen ‚Äì lead guitar * Olli-Pekka Laine ‚Äì bass * Jan Rechberger ‚Äì drums * Kasper M√•rtenson ‚Äì keyboards ===Additional musicians=== * Ville Tuomi ‚Äì clean vocals, speech ==References== Category:Amorphis albums Category:1994 albums Category:Relapse Records albums Category:Music based on the Kalevala ","title":"Tales from the Thousand Lakes"},{"id":"3254712","text":"Badbury Hundred was a hundred in the county of Dorset, England, which took its name from the earthwork of Badbury Rings.

(\\"Over The Top\\") was a late-night adult version of the anarchic ATV children's show Tiswas, which was made by its ITV franchise successor Central Independent Television. It was broadcast at 11.00pm on Saturday nights for one series in 1982. O.T.T. was created and presented by Chris Tarrant, and also starred ex-Tiswasians John Gorman, Lenny Henry and Bob Carolgees. Helen Atkinson-Wood was the female sidekick replacement for Sally James, who stayed behind to present the concurrent and final series of Tiswas alone. ==Origins== The programme's origins can be traced to Tarrant and Gorman discussing the future, and accepting that they couldn't go on forever doing a kids' programme, and explored the idea of doing a 'grown-up, late-night Tiswas'. Gorman's 'Bucket of water' song, getting into the top 30, and a successful nationwide tour with Sally James and Bob Carolgees, as The Four Bucketeers, confirmed that there was an 'Adult' audience out there. Initially, the aim had been to do Tiswas in the morning and OTT in the evening; but it was felt that this wouldn't work. On 28 March 1981, Tarrant, Carolgees and Gorman left Tiswas for good to start work on O.T.T.. In January 1982, Chris Tarrant told Kenneth Kennaugh: \\"We know Tiswas has enormous potential appeal for adults. Quite what that appeal was remained remarkably ill-defined.\\" The same article stated that Lenny Henry \\" ... doesn't know what he will be doing in tonight's O.T.T.. But one thing is sure. When the show ends he'll be standing under a hot shower - 'just to recover' ... Henry loves the uncontrolled humour where even he never knows what is going to happen next. Tiswas was marvellous to work on. It was a new style of lunatic humour, and we got away with murder. When I first started Tiswas, my nerves used to go before each show simply because it was live. But now, in OTT I just get on with it.\\" ==Series== Later, in his book Great Bus Journeys of the World Alexei Sayle said of his time on the show \\"I was good, Lenny Henry was good, the show was packed with vibrant life... it was happy to come from Birmingham and not tainted with Londoniswhereitsatism... it was very popular, with 7-8 million viewers...\\". ==The name OTT== An abbreviation of the phrase \\"over the top\\". The origin of the name came about when John Gorman, working with Chris on a late night version of Tiswas, compiled a list of possible titles; which included BigTis and OTT. It was Mike Palin who 'voted' for the OTT title. Rick Wakeman told an interview with Tiswas Online that he was a member of: \\"an elite showbiz club, called 'Over The Top' in the late seventies. I became chairman and the president was a record plugger called Allan James, who also used to supply some of the music acts for Tiswas. We would all meet up in restaurants. There were about 20 of us in all, and whilst the evening meal would start quite normally, it usually ended in ejection or sometimes arrest as things became very similar to that of the Tiswas programme. We called ourselves the Over the Top Club. Membership was elite and we were banned eventually from at least nine restaurants to my knowledge.\\"Tiswas Online ==Episode guide== 12 episodes and one compilation finale were broadcast between 2 January and 3 April 1982. ==References == ==External links== *Comedy Guide - O.T.T. bbc.co.uk *O.T.T. discussion forum at Tiswas Online *Tiswas Online page on related shows (including OTT) *Rare British Television Reviews - A detailed look at the last ever episode of OTT *Off The Telly - The Glory Game - The Rise of Saturday Night Television Part 5 (includes section on OTT) Category:1982 British television series debuts Category:1982 British television series endings Category:ITV (TV network) original programming Category:1980s British television sketch shows Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:English-language television shows Category:Television shows produced by Central Independent Television ","title":"O.T.T."},{"id":"3254719","text":"The Belfast Group was a poets' workshop which was organized by Philip Hobsbaum when he moved to Belfast in October 1963 to lecture in English at Queen's University. As with Hobsbaum's earlier discussion group in London, known as The Group, the meetings commenced with the discussion of a single poet's work. After a break for coffee and biscuits, there was an open session in which participants could read any work they wished to. The group met once a week, initially on Tuesday evenings at 8:00pm, later on Monday evenings. During term time it met at No. 4 Fitzwilliam Street, Philip and Hannah Hobsbaum's home near the university. Seamus Heaney attended group meetings from the start. Seven of the poems in Heaney's Eleven Poems (November 1965) were taken from his 'group sheets'. Heaney has said that the group \\"ratified the idea of writing\\". Michael Longley started attending after his return to Belfast in 1964. He has said that the group gave \\"an air of seriousness and electricity to the notion of writing\\", and that he was \\"surprised by the ferocity of Hobsbaum's attack\\". Other participants over the years included: James Simmons, Paul Muldoon, Ciar√°n Carson, Stewart Parker, Bernard MacLaverty, Frank Ormsby and the critics Edna Longley and Michael Allen. Louis Muinzer, the translator and theatre director was also a member of the group. In 1965 and 1966, the Belfast Festival at Queen's published pamphlets by some of the members of the group, including Heaney, Longley, and this attracted a certain amount of publicity. After Hobsbaum's departure for Glasgow in 1966, the Group lapsed for a while, but then was reconstituted in 1968 by Michael Allen, Arthur Terry, and Heaney. Meetings were held at Seamus and Marie Heaney's house on Ashley Avenue. May 1968 saw the first issue of The Honest Ulsterman, edited by James Simmons.

The term \\"Greater Bristol\\" is used by some to denote the whole of this area, and by others only to denote the contiguous urban area including, for example, right Greater Bristol is a term used for the conurbation which contains and surrounds the city of Bristol in the South West of England. There is no official \\"Greater Bristol\\" authority, but the term is sometimes used by local, regional and national authorities, and others as a synonym for either the \\"Bristol Urban Area\\" or a wider area of the former County of Avon (sometimes the whole of the former County of Avon area), and by some, TfGB (Transport for Greater Bristol), to refer to the Province of Bristol as defined by C. B. Fawcett (1919) or Derek Senior (1969). The Bristol post town covers a wider area than the city of Bristol. ==Problems of definition== One definition of \\"Greater Bristol\\" is the \\"Bristol Built-up Area\\" (previously termed the \\"Bristol Urban Area\\"), as defined by the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS).Office for National Statistics, 2011 Built-up Areas ‚Äì Methodology and Guidance, p.3 This covers the contiguous built-up area around Bristol, including the Kingswood, Mangotsfield, Stoke Gifford, Bradley Stoke, Patchway, Filton, Almondsbury, Frampton Cotterell and Winterbourne areas within South Gloucestershire; Easton-in-Gordano within North Somerset; and part of Whitchurch which falls within the administrative area of Bath and North East Somerset. However, this ONS definition does not include the city of Bath, or the towns of Yate, Keynsham, Portishead, Clevedon or Weston-super-Mare. The wider \\"Greater Bristol\\" area ‚Äì that is, the former Avon county area ‚Äì has since 1996 been divided for local government purposes between Bristol City Council, and Bath and North East Somerset, North Somerset, and South Gloucestershire councils, and is shown on the map on this page. The boundaries of the County of Avon, which administered the area from 1974 to 1996, were similar to those of the Bristol Travel to Work Area as originally defined in the 1950s. The former county area is still used in some official UK statistics and by local and regional authorities, for example in transport planning, with the South West Regional Government Office commissioning a Greater Bristol Strategic Transport Study in 2005,Atkins, 2005. \\"Greater Bristol Strategic Transport Study .\\" and the local authorities presenting a Joint Local Transport Plan to the DfT in 2006.B&NES;, Bristol, North Somerset & South Gloucestershire councils, 2006. \\"Greater Bristol Joint Local Transport Plan. \\" Other alternative names occasionally in official use for the former Avon area include the West of England and Severnside. The term \\"CUBA\\" (county that used to be Avon) has also occasionally been used unofficially. Transport for Greater Bristol (TfGB) has also used 'Greater Bristol' to refer to a travel to work area of 50 miles radius around Bristol which it wishes to be covered by an Integrated Transport Authority (ITA). This is similar to the 'Province of Bristol' described by geographer C. B. Fawcett in 1919. The area within the administrative City of Bristol limits had a population of 428,200 according to the 2011 census. The ONS give a figure for the Bristol Urban Area of 617,280, making it the tenth largest conurbation in England and Wales. The 2001 census figure was 551,006 and the 1991 census figure was 522,784. The 2001 population of the former county of Avon was 983,860.

The Spanish Renaissance was a movement in Spain, emerging from the Italian Renaissance in Italy during the 14th century, that spread to Spain during the 15th and 16th centuries. This new focus in art, literature, quotes and science inspired by the Greco-Roman tradition of Classical antiquity, received a major impulse from several events in 1492: *Unification of the longed-for Christian kingdom with the definitive taking of Granada, the last Islamic controlled territory in the Iberian Peninsula, and the successive expulsions of thousands of Muslim and Jewish believers, *The official discovery of the western hemisphere, the Americas, *The publication of the first grammar of a vernacular European language, the Gram√°tica (Grammar) by Antonio de Nebrija. ==Historical background== Image of Isabella I of Castile in the Rimado de la Conquista de Granada The beginning of the Renaissance in Spain is closely linked to the historical-political life of the monarchy of the Catholic Monarchs. Its figures are the first to leave the medieval approaches that secured a feudal scheme of weak monarch over a powerful and restless nobility. The Catholic Monarchs unite the forces of the incipient state and ally with the principal families of the nobility to maintain their power. One of these families, the Mendoza, use the new style like distinction of its clan and, by extension, of the protection of the monarchy. Little by little, the novel esthetic was introduced into the rest of the court and the clergy, mixing with purely Iberian styles, like the Nasrid art of the dying kingdom of Granada, the exalted and personal Gothic Castilian queen, and the Flemish tendencies in the official painting of the court and the Church. The assimilation of elements gave way to a personal interpretation of the orthodox Renaissance, which came to be called Plateresque. Therefore, secondary artists were brought in from Italy, apprentices were sent to the Italian shops, they brought designs, architectural plans, books and engravings, paintings, etc., of which portraits, themes and composition were copied. King Charles I was more predisposed to the new art, paradoxically called the old way, remitted to the Classical antiquity. His direct patronage achieved some of the most beautiful works of the special and unique Spanish Renaissance style: the patronage of Almazan de Covarrubias, his commissions for Titian, who never agreed to relocate to Spain. Painters of great quality were, far from the courtier nucleus, Pedro Berruguete, Juan de Juanes, Paolo da San Leocadio, of whom the delicate Virgin of the Caballero de Montesa is highlighted, Y√°√±ez de la Almazan and Gerardo de los Llanos. The painting of the Spanish Renaissance is normally completed in oil. It realizes interiors perfectly subject to the laws of perspective, without over-emphasis of the people. The figures are all of the same size and anatomically correct. The colors and the shading are applied in tonal ranges, according to the Italian teachings. To accentuate the Italian style, in addition, it is common to add elements directly copied from it, like the adornments a candelieri (borders of vegetables and cupids that surround the frames), or Roman ruins in the countrysides, including in scenes of the life of Christ. ==Literature== Vida del Lazarillo de Tormes, de sus fortunas y adversidades published in 1554.

It is published and edited in Vienna. Started in 2004, the magazine is now published ten times annually. Although its stories focus on the political and cultural life of Austria, Datum has a significant audience outside of the country. Throughout the German-language- countries it is well known for its journalism on political, cultural and social issues, its illustrations, its rigorous fact checking and copyediting and its cosmopolitan sophistication. ==History== Datum debuted in March 2004. It was founded by author and journalist Klaus Stimeder (aka JM Stim) and Hannes Weyringer, a businessman and financial consultant. Stimeder wanted to create a sophisticated monthly based on the editorial concepts of The New Yorker, German weekly Die Zeit and the weekend supplement of the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, providing long articles with background information on contemporary and historical topics. The magazine's first office was based in Stimeder's apartment in a public housing project in Vienna. Regardless of the early, occasionally precarious years of its existence, it soon established itself as a pre-eminent forum for non-fiction writing and serious journalism. In subsequent years the magazine published features, essays and commentaries by many of the most respected (and sometimes controversial) contemporary Austrian writers, journalists, artists, politicians, sportsmen and scientists, including Karl Markovics, Wolf D. Prix, Johannes Hahn, Kurt Waldheim, Anton Zeilinger, Alfred Dorfer, Ursula Plassnik, Bernhard Lang, Louie Austen, Oliver Welter, Ursula Stenzel, Alfred Gusenbauer, Deborah Sengl, Peter Noever, Markus Kupferblum, Barbara Prammer, Toni Innauer, Toni Innauer, Lothar H√∂belt or Andreas Khol. Notable permanent contributors include philosopher Franz Schuh, Viennese actionist painter G√ºnter Brus, Philip K√∂ster, founder and editor of soccer magazine 11 Freunde, and Michael Frank, the long-time Vienna and Prague correspondent of S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, who from 2005 to 2014 Frank curated a section named ‚ÄúAlte Texte‚Äù (‚ÄúOld Texts‚Äù) under which the magazine re-published popular, but mostly less known pieces by classic authors like Kurt Tucholsky, Stefan Zweig or Heinrich B√∂ll. Since its debut the magazine has been awarded with numerous international and domestic awards for its design and for its content. In September 2005, Tyler Br√ªl√© awarded Datum with a \\"Fast Lane Media Award\\" in the \\"Best International News Magazine\\". In his column in the Financial Times he stated: \\"Austria's Datum is showing others how it should be done. With its slightly off, always iconic covers, matte paper stock and sharp lay-outs it's become a cult favourite among art directors around the world. The website's a thing of beauty, too.\\" In 2007 Stimeder published the ‚ÄúDatum Code of Ethics‚Äù, making the magazine the first privately owned medium in Austrian media history to have one. In 2009 DATUM was named one of the \\"100 Most Innovative Magazines in the World\\" by members of a jury of Luxembourg- based magazine symposium \\"Colophon\\". From 2007 to 2009 the magazine co- operated with Vienna's Rabenhof Theater in co-hosting a series of literary events called \\"DATUM presents‚Äù. The series brought an array of acclaimed international writers to Austria's capital, notably Chuck Palahniuk, Ian Rankin, Sven Regener, Juli Zeh, FM Einheit, Manuel Andrack, Thomas Brussig, and Robert Menasse. In its early years, the magazine started to sometimes publish three or for stories a month online, but in recent years has increased its online output significantly, mostly by adding blogs. In August 2008 Austrian trade magazine ‚ÄúDer Journalist‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Journalist‚Äù) called Datum ‚ÄúThe Best School for Young Writers in the Country\\". Stimeder edited the magazine until 2009 and stayed on as publisher until 2010. == Change of ownership == In 2010, Stimeder sold his shares in Datum to his partner Weyringer who subsequently sold a minority of shares to Stefan Kaltenbrunner, a journalist and corporate publishing consultant who had started working for the magazine in 2008 and succeeded Stimeder as editor a year later. Starting in 2013 publishing company Medecco acquired 100 percent of Datum's shares. In February 2016 medecco announced an asset deal with Stefan Apfl, an award-winning journalist who had been among the first generation of journalists to work for the magazine. Apfl acquired the title copyright for Datum as well as the magazine's subscriber database. He had previously succeeded Kaltenbrunner as editor in late 2015. ==Readership== Datum is read nationwide, with 84 percent of its circulation in Austria's metropolitan areas (municipalities above 5.000 people). According to a survey conducted by Peter Hajek Public Opinion Strategies in 2008, the vast majority of readers is between 20 and 39 years of age. The average household income of Datum readers in 2008 ranged between at least 1.800 Euros to more than 3.000 Euros (the average income in Austria in 2008 was 2.088 Euros). 58 percent of its readers have at least one college degree, while 34 percent have a High School Diploma. ==See also== List of magazines in Austria ==References== == External links == * Category:2004 establishments in Austria Category:Magazines published in Austria Category:Monthly magazines published in Austria Category:News magazines published in Europe Category:German-language magazines Category:Magazines established in 2004 Category:Political magazines ","title":"Datum (magazine)"},{"id":"3254800","text":"Phocas or Phokas (from ) may refer to: *Saint Phocas, Bishop of Sinope *Saint Phocas, a 4th-century Christian martyr *Flavius Phocas, Byzantine emperor from 602610 *John Phokas, 12th-century pilgrim and writer *Phokas (Byzantine family), Byzantine nobles including: **Nikephoros Phokas the Elder, general **Leo Phokas the Elder, son of Nikephoros, general **Bardas Phokas the Elder, son of Nikephoros, general **Nikephoros II Phokas, son of Bardas, Byzantine emperor from 963969 **Leo Phokas the Younger, son of Bardas, general and curopalates **Bardas Phokas the Younger, son of Leo, general and rebel against Basil II ","title":"Phocas (disambiguation)"},{"id":"3254801","text":"Brownshall Hundred was a hundred in the county of Dorset, England, containing the following parishes: *Holwell (transferred from Somerset 1844) *Lydlinch *Stalbridge *Stock Gaylard (absorbed by Lydlinch 1884) *Stourton Caundle ==See also== *List of hundreds in Dorset ==Sources== *Boswell, Edward, 1833: The Civil Division of the County of Dorset (published on CD by Archive CD Books Ltd, 1992) *Hutchins, John, History of Dorset, vols 1-4 (3rd ed 1861‚Äì70; reprinted by EP Publishing, Wakefield, 1973) *Mills, A.

It is the eleventh book in the Honor Harrington series. ==Plot summary== Due to the actions of the High Ridge government in War of Honor, which led to a successful attack on key Alliance shipyards by the Republic of Haven, the Star Kingdom of Manticore finds itself decidedly on the short end of the strategic balance between the two warring star nations. Admiral Honor Harrington is placed in command of Eighth Fleet, the Manticoran Alliance's primary offensive force, which is the sole heavy formation available for operations against Haven. Queen Elizabeth and her senior advisors project it will be at least two \\"T-years\\" (Terran years, i.e. Earth years) before they can expect any significant numbers of new construction to begin bolstering their thin wall of battle; this while Haven's progress under Admirals Theisman and Foraker have given them an even larger force advantage, and smaller technological disparity, than Haven suffered before the beginning of hostilities in Short Victorious War. Strategically, the Eighth Fleet's goal is to instill enough operational caution and sensitivity to losses in Haven to force redeployments of starships in defensive postures, reducing Haven's offensive resources. To expedite this, they are assigned the lion's share of Manticore's cutting-edge warfighting hardware, including the new \\"Apollo\\" self-guided missile system and \\"Keyhole\\" platforms that increase the efficacy of their own counter-missiles. Their first two raids do indeed instill some panic into the Havenite populace, but on the third, at Solon, a defensive ambush led by Admiral Javier Giscard is waiting for them. Honor is sorely trounced, losing several ships and being forced to abandon a vessel captained by her best friend, Admiral Michelle \\"Mike\\" Henke, Countess Gold Peak, to its own devices; Henke is believed killed in action. Honor continues to work closely with Hamish Alexander, now First Lord of the Admiralty, on the military and political challenges facing the Alliance, and they fall into the very romantic relationship the High Ridge government tried to insinuate during War of Honor. She and Hamish are married and conceive a son, Raoul, who is \\"tubed\\" while his mother goes into combat and is born before the end of the novel. Emily, with the assistance of Honor's mother Allison, a leading geneticist, also becomes a mother with Hamish. Republic of Haven President Eloise Pritchart continues to work towards finding a peaceful solution to the war. She and her administration discover the peace talks were sabotaged by her Secretary of State, Arnold Giancola. Unfortunately, both he and his accomplice, Yves Grosclaude, are killed before they can be questioned. This lack of proof prevents Pritchart from coming forward and accepting culpability for the current war, but she nonetheless sends Mike Henke‚Äîactually a POW‚Äîback to Manticore with an offer for a peace conference. Queen Elizabeth accepts, but several more cases of the nanotechnology are deployed to in assassination attempts on other figures of Manticoran note, including Queen Berry of Torch and her Head of Intelligence. This forces Elizabeth to resume the war, ordering the Eighth Fleet to attack the Lovat System. Honor does so, and this time turns the tables on Giscard's ambushers, leading to the destruction of most of his fleet, as well as his death. Pritchart, with few options and devastated by the loss of her lover Giscard, realizes that if Haven cannot conclude the war peacefully, they must conclude it violently. She authorizes \\"Operation Beatrice,\\" a direct strike at the Manticore System itself. The result is the largest space battle in recorded history: Haven's Second and Fifth fleets against the Manticoran Home, Third and Eighth Fleets. After several engagements, Harrington arrives and obliterates the Fifth Fleet, and Tourville surrenders the remainder of Second. == Commentary == Most of the action takes place simultaneously with the events of The Shadow of Saganami. In addition to Manticore, Haven, and Grayson, front stage players (even those lurking in the wings of the stage) now include the Andermani, who have entered the Manticorian Alliance; the genetic slavers of Mesa, secretly striving to keep Manticore and Haven shooting at each other as long as possible; non-self absorbed elements of the Solarian League continuing the inexorable and glacier creep of League influence; and the inhabitants of the Talbot Cluster, clamoring for membership in the Star Kingdom after discovering the new Manticore Junction terminus in their region of space. The book was released in hardcover in 2005 (with a CD-ROM containing free copies of other works written by Weber). Advance Reader Copies were made available for sale at baen.com some months previously, with a sizable portion of the book being \\"snippetted\\" on Baen's Bar for free. ==Trivia== In conference, Admiral Thomas Caparelli tells Honor that Hamish has compared her favorably to the Old Earth \\"wet-navy\\" Admirals Raphael Semmes and Bill Halsey.See end of Chapter 23. Hamish said Honor had \\"marginally better tactical sense than Semmes and better strategic sense than Halsey.\\" Semmes is remembered for his strategy and Halsey for his tactics, and Honor knows this. David Weber has stated his original plan was to have Honor in charge of the third fleet during the final battle, and perish during the battle. Her son, then would have had his own series start as he came of age, at which point the Solarian League begins its breakup, and a long war begins.An Authorial Note.

Hallgr√≠mur's father, Helgi Hallgr√≠msson, is an engineer, the former head of the Icelandic Road Administration. His mother is Margr√©t Schram, a retired kindergarten teacher. His sister N√≠na Helgad√≥ttir works for the Red Cross, his brother Gunnar Helgason is an actor and an award-winning writer of children's‚Äô books, and his brother √Åsmundur Helgason works in advertising and publishing. In 1984 Hallgr√≠mur fathered his first child, Hallger√∞ur Hallgr√≠msd√≥ttir. In 1985, he met flautist √Åshildur Haraldsd√≥ttir, a student at the Boston Conservatory. They lived together in Boston, New York and Paris, got married in 1988 and divorced in 1992. In the years 2003-2009, Hallgr√≠mur lived with Oddn√Ω Sturlud√≥ttir, a city councilor. They have two children together, K√°ri Dan√≠el born 2003, and Margr√©t Mar√≠a born 2005. Since 2009 Hallgr√≠mur has been living with Agla Magn√∫sd√≥ttir, senior adviser at the Icelandic Literature Center. Hallgr√≠mur and Agla live in Reykjav√≠k and the island of Hr√≠sey, with his younger kids and a dog named Lukka. ==The 1980s== Hallgr√≠mur Helgason in Aarhus Denmark (2016) Hallgr√≠mur started out as a visual artist, studying at the Iceland Academy of the Arts (1980‚Äì81) and The Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, Germany (1981‚Äì82). Unsatisfied with both, he started painting on his own, mostly romantic colorful and ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù landscapes inspired by his native Iceland, a clear break with the current fashions of conceptual and minimal art. After a couple of personal shows in Reykjavik, he spent the winter of 1985-86 in Boston, where he showed at Bromfield Gallery on Newbury Street, and met the Starn Twins (Doug and Mike Starn) and other artists represented by Stux Gallery, located in the same building. From 1986 to '89 Hallgr√≠mur lived in New York City, painting and drawing, with moderate success, showing at Hal Bromm Gallery, Stux Gallery and other places. In an effort to support himself he started writing weekly articles for a newspaper back home in Reykjavik, describing life in the Big Apple. He also developed his own weekly radio program, named ‚ÄúRadio Manhattan‚Äù, for Icelandic State Radio, recording his impressions of the streets and life around his home in Hell's Kitchen and shipping them up north on a cassette. Encouraged by the good reception to the articles, as well as his radio rants, Hallgr√≠mur felt the pressure to take a break from painting and try to write a novel. ==First novel== Hallgr√≠mur Helgason's first novel, Hella, was published in 1990, a visual and cinematic story that takes place in the small village of Hella, situated in southern Iceland, an agricultural county surrounded by the volcanoes Mt. Hekla and Eyjafjallaj√∂kull and famous for its big earthquakes. Hallgr√≠mur aims for a totally objective tone, tries to stay away from poetic descriptions and the use of adjectives. The text never enters the mind or the feelings of the characters, describing everything from the outside. It's an attempt at letting the inner world be read through the signs of the outer visual world. Inspired by Flaubert's Madame Bovary as well as Duchamp's Large Glass, the book tells the story of one summer in the life of a 14-year-old girl who gets her first job at the highway diner and has her first sexual encounter in a tent at the local horse fair. The latter coincides with a small earthquake shaking the area. The novel can be read as one big metaphor for the transition from virgin to woman. The novel received a lukewarm reception--at most the critics said the book was interesting--and sales were modest. ==The Paris Years== Between 1990-95 Hallgr√≠mur lived in Paris, painting and writing. In New York the subject of his paintings had shifted from landscape to figures: stylized in the manner of Keith Haring and the late eighties, it seemed the artist was trying hard to update the Picasso nude. In Paris his paintings at first turned more ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù, in the manner of (the American) George Condo, until Hallgr√≠mur found his more personal style, more realistic and cartoonish at the same time, by leaving out the background. The figures were painted in the middle of a canvas which was left virgin white around them. In Paris, Hallgr√≠mur had two solo exhibitions in the early nineties, at Galerie Alain Gutharc and Galerie Philippe Rizzo. Here he also wrote his second novel, √ûetta er allt a√∞ koma (Things Are Going Great), which was published in 1994, and became Hallgr√≠mur's breakthrough as a writer. Here he found his true writing voice, his own style overflowing with words, ideas and stories. The book is an ironic take on the traditional Icelandic mini-celebrity biography, a genre that was very popular at the time. Ragga Birna is a ‚Äúfamous‚Äù actress and musician who remembers her life in the most positive light. Her life is full of failures, but she meets all of them with the self-delusional phrase ‚ÄúThings are going great!‚Äù. She goes from the piano to violin, from violin to viola, from viola to singing, from singing to acting, from acting to movie-acting, from movie-acting to bad movie-acting. The reader slowly learns that this woman has never had any talent for any art in her life. Yet her whole being has been commit-ted to fulfil her dream of ‚Äúmaking it‚Äù as an artist. The character of Ragga Birna and her tragic life story was based on Hallgr√≠mur's impressions of the artist's life in Iceland and the States during the seventies and eighties, and makes good fun of the big eighties idea of ‚Äúmaking it‚Äù. Indeed, the book makes fun of almost every aspect of artistic life in Iceland in the years from Ragga's birth in 1959 until she finally reaches her ‚Äústardom‚Äù in 1994, when she is paralysed from waist down in an accident on the set of a no-budget Icelandic Viking movie and ends up on the front page in a wheelchair, all smiling and happy with her long overdue fame. The book became a local hit and a theatre version was put on stage at the National Theatre of Iceland in 2004, directed by Baltasar Korm√°kur. ==101 Reykjavik== Hallgr√≠mur spent autumn 1995 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY, writing his third novel, 101 Reykjavik. It was published in 1996 and turned into a successful movie in the year 2000, directed by Baltasar Korm√°kur and starring Hilmir Sn√¶r Gu√∞nason and Victoria Abril. The novel takes its title from the postal code of the Reykjavik downtown area. It is a first person narrative, set in the strange mind of Hlynur Bj√∂rn, a mid-nineties slacker who never leaves the downtown area, is unemployed and lives with his mother. He spends his days on the internet or watching videos, and his nights at the K-bar, a fictional hangout based on the famous Kaffibarinn, which at the time was partly owned by Damon Albarn, the famous singer of Blur. The novel coincided with and accidentally captured the rise of Reykjavik as a trendy city, launched by the fame of its best known citizen, Bj√∂rk. Hallgr√≠mur invented the character Hlynur Bj√∂rn in the summer of 1990 and used him from time to time as his own Borat, allowing him guest appearances on his radio show, Radio Manhattan, and thus developing his strange style of thinking and talking over a period of five years. The idea for the plot came partly from the French movie, Gazon Maudit, by Josiane Balasco (also starring Victoria Abril), and Shakespeare‚Äôs Hamlet. Like Hamlet, Hlynur Bj√∂rn becomes burdened by his mother‚Äôs sex life, when she comes out of the closet as a lesbian, and introduces him to her girlfriend, the much younger Lolla, whom Hlynur Bj√∂rn already has slept with. Things get even more complicated when it is revealed that Lolla is pregnant. The book was originally met with negative reviews and poor sales in Iceland, but later found an international readership, after the movie won prizes at several film festivals. It was nominated on behalf of Iceland for the Nordic Council Literature Prize in 1999. It became a bestseller in Italy and Poland and has been published in 14 languages. American novelist Tim Sandlin famously wrote in his review: ‚ÄúImagine if Henry Miller had written Tropic of Cancer on crack instead of wine.‚Äùhttp://www.timsandlin.com/recommended.html ==The Author of Iceland== Since 1996 Hallgr√≠mur has been living in his hometown, Reykjavik. In 1998 he published his first book of poetry, Collected Poems 1978-1998. A truly post-modern work, it was all written in the Icelandic nineteenth-century tradition of rhyming poetry, full of jokes and irony, with a nod to American rap lyrics, and was a clear break with the serious modern tradition of the twentieth century in Icelandic poetry. There were no poems about nature, silent lakes or lava fields. In 2001 Hallgr√≠mur published his biggest and most ambitious novel, H√∂fundur √çslands (The Author of Iceland). It was a succ√®s de scandale, since the main character was based on the biggest Icelandic writer, Halld√≥r Laxness (1902-1998), who received the Nobel prize in 1955. The novel tells the story of a very old and famous Icelandic writer who dies and wakes up inside a novel he wrote some fifty years earlier. Thus the author lives on in his work. The main character, Einar J. Gr√≠msson, is partly based on Laxness and the novel he's trapped in is inspired by Laxness's biggest novel, Independent People. Its publication caused outrage among the old leftist elite in Iceland who felt it was sacrilege to write about Laxness, especially his communist past. The Author of Iceland has been translated into German, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish and Italian. It won the Icelandic Literary Prize in 2001. ==Grim== Since 1995, Hallgr√≠mur has been working on his cartoon self and alter-ego called Grim. A Tintin-style m√©lange of Dracula and Pinocchio, the long-nosed and fang-toothed character symbolizes the role of the artist/writer, who sucks blood out of real people's lives and then goes on making up stories about them. Hallgr√≠mur has made paintings and drawings featuring Grim, and devoted a couple of exhibitions to this strange fellow. A catalogue, ‚ÄúBest of Grim‚Äù, was published in Iceland in 2004, by Forlagid, and in 2005 French publisher Actes Sud published a book, Les Contes de Grim, featuring all the existing Grim works. ==Mr. Universe ‚Äî a ‚Äúcin√©-roman‚Äù== After the big and ambitious Author of Iceland, Hallgr√≠mur published the short and comic sci-fi novel Mr. Universe, written in Italy in the summer of 2002. Written as a mock Hollywood blockbuster movie, it tells the tale of the fight between God and mankind. God lives on a small planet, Planet Zero, in the middle of his universe, managing all his 716 different mankinds on as many planets. One day he learns that his mankind on Planet 607 (Earth) has managed to clone itself. God gets angry and decides to kill off this annoying mankind and replace it with a new one. When the deceased souls from planet 607, who reside in the VIP camps at Planet Zero, learn about the big boss's plan, they decide to try to save their planet. Their leader is Napoleon Nixon (a soul that has been both men) who leads the operation against God, a journey that takes him inside Planet Zero, where the Devil reigns. Keeping in line with the movie-like ‚Äúcin√©-roman‚Äù, all the characters of the novel are cast by the author. God is played by Marlon Brando, Woody Allen is his assistant, Salman Rushdie the scientist in charge of creating a new mankind. Anthony Hopkins is Napoleon Nixon and his muscular assistant is played by Mike Tyson, in the role of the Devil is Leonardo DiCaprio. Mr. Universe was published in France, in 2015, under the title ‚ÄúLa grosse col√®re‚Äù. ==Stormland== Stormland (2005) was Hallgr√≠mur's first contemporary novel since 101 Reykjavik. Set in North Iceland, in the small town of Sau√∞√°rkr√≥kur, it tells the story of B√∂ddi, an angry blogger in the countryside, who dreams of a revolution and a complete overhaul of the western capitalist system. Soaked in German literature, philosophy and romantic idealism √† la Nietzsche, after his years of study in Berlin, he finds it hard to fit into his old and very small home town. B√∂ddi is the guy who never makes compromises. Living with his lonely mother, the TV addict, he loses his teaching job on the first page, his love midway and his mind at the end of the book. Stormland was written at the height of the boom and bubble years in Icelandic history, when the nation had completely lost itself in the materialistic craziness that led up to the big financial Crash in 2008. It became a bestseller in Denmark, and has also been translated into Norwegian, Swedish and German. It was nominated for the Nordic Council Literature Prize in 2007. A movie based on the novel, Stormland, was released in Iceland in 2011. It was written and directed by Marteinn Thorsson, and starring √ìlafur Darri √ìlafsson in his first leading film role. His performance earned him an Edda Award for Best Actor. ==The Hitman‚Äôs Guide to Housecleaning== Hallgr√≠mur's only novel written in English was also his only flirt with the crime novel genre. Tomislav Boksic, aka Toxic, is a professional hitman for the Croatian Mafia in New York. His record is near flawless, he has 66 killings on his CV, when killing number 67 proves to be a failure. The victim turns out to be an FBI guy. Forced to flee the States, Toxic finds himself at JFK at the beginning of the novel. There he spots the FBI waiting for him at the gate. He turns and hides in the men's‚Äô room, contemplating his moves, when out from one of the stalls comes another bald guy, who looks a bit like him. Being a pro, Toxic kills the bald man, takes on his clothes, ID, passport and air ticket. The dead one turns out to be a TV- evangelist from Richmond, Virginia, on his way to Iceland to preach on a local Christian TV station. So the Croatian hitman arrives in Reykjavik, disguised as a TV preacher. A classic tale of mistaken identities, the novel offers an outsider's view of Iceland, that according to the author was ‚Äúa fun challenge: To write about my home country as if I had never been there before‚Äù. ==Suit & Tie== In the fall of 2009, Hallgr√≠mur was asked to open the Kapittel Literature Festival in Stavanger, Norway. For the occasion he wrote a five- minute-long poem titled Suit & Tie, commemorating the first anniversary of the Financial Crash that hit Iceland so hard in October 2008. He later recorded his rendering of it, which can be enjoyed on YouTube. ==The Thousand Degree Woman== A historical novel published in 2011, The Thousand Degree Woman (in some countries titled The Woman at 1000¬∞) is based on the real life of Brynhildur Georg√≠a Bj√∂rnsson, an Icelandic woman whom Hallgr√≠mur accidentally met over the telephone in 2006, when he was aiding his ex-wife during an election campaign, getting people to vote for the Social Democratic Party. Ms. Bj√∂rnsson died in 2007 but had published her biography in 1983. Her father had also published his biography in 1988. He was one of a handful of Icelanders who fought with the Nazis in World War Two. Brynhildur's grandfather was the first president of Iceland, Mr. Sveinn Bj√∂rnsson. ==Portraits and Darkness== In 2012 Hallgr√≠mur picked up his paint brushes again. The result was a show in September 2013 at the Tveir hrafnar listh√∫s, Reykjav√≠k, of black-and-white portraits of famous Icelandic authors from the first half of the twentieth century. Douglas Coupland wrote about the show for Artforum. Another show followed in September 2015, titled ‚ÄúAcrylic on Darkness I - Outside Your House, at Night, While You‚Äôre Sleeping‚Äù. It consisted of nightscapes from the Reykjavik suburbs, cars parked in driveways outside houses, hardly visible in the pitch black dark. ‚ÄúWe have darkness most of the time up here, on our northern island. Still we have hardly ever painted it or done art about it.‚Äù For the big group show ‚ÄúJust Painted 2‚Äù at the Reykjavik Art Museum in 2015, Hallgr√≠mur did a big portrait of J√≥n Gnarr, the comedian turned mayor of Reykjavik, titled ‚ÄúThe Gnarr Family‚Äù, featuring a family of 8, where all the characters were ‚Äúplayed‚Äù by Gnarr. ==Seasick in Munich== Hallgr√≠mur's first and only autobiographical novel, Seasick in Munich, was published in 2015. It describes one winter in the life of the author, when he studied art at the famous Art Academy in Munich in 1981-82. ‚ÄúThe most difficult winter in my life,‚Äù according to the author. It's a classic Bildungsroman but with a fantastical twist that nods both to Hamsun‚Äôs Hunger and Kafka‚Äôs A Hunger Artist. It‚Äôs the story of Young Man, a shy 21-year old from a provincial and isolated country, who for the first time in his life is made to live on his own, in a big European city. Shy, non-German speaking, and not fitting in with the latest trends at the Academy, he has a hard time adopting to the difficult Bavarian capital. He hasn‚Äôt even had a beer yet, since beer was banned in Iceland until 1989. Very much an artist‚Äôs novel, it describes the soul- searching process of the Young Man, his quest for finding himself, and his wrestling with the giants of the past, like Halld√≥r Laxness, Gustave Flaubert and Edvard Munch, but mostly Marcel Duchamp and The Large Glass. The book was a success with the critics (‚ÄúOne of Helgason‚Äôs best books‚Äù - Fr√©ttabla√∞i√∞) and sold well. In Iceland the main discussion around it, though, was about the chapter describing a rape that the Young Man experiences on his Italian trip, at Christmas night in Florence. In an ugly newspaper column, that caused an outrage among readers, Icelandic writer Gudbergur Bergsson (born 1932) ‚Äúslut- shamed‚Äù his colleague Hallgr√≠mur for bringing this topic into light, accusing him of using a rape scene to sell his book, and finishing off by asking ‚Äúwhich faggot had such bad taste?‚Äù ==Bibliography== ===Novels=== * Hella (1990) * √ûetta er allt a√∞ koma (Things Are Going Great, 1994) * 101 Reykjav√≠k (1996) * H√∂fundur √çslands (The Author of Iceland, 2001) * Herra Alheimur (Mr. Universe, 2003) * Rokland (Stormland, 2005) * The Hitman's Guide to Housecleaning (written in English and translated by the author into Icelandic as 10 r√°√∞ til a√∞ h√¶tta a√∞ drepa f√≥lk og byrja a√∞ vaska upp, 2008) * Konan vi√∞ 1000¬∞ (The Woman at 1000¬∞, 2011) * Sj√≥veikur √≠ M√ºnchen (Seasick in Munich, 2015) ===Poetry=== * Lj√≥√∞m√¶li 1978‚Äì1998 (Collected Poetry 1978‚Äì1998, 1998) * 'Suit & Tie' (2009) ===Selected Solo Exhibitions=== * √Åsmundarsalur, Reykjavik (1984) * The Living Art Museum, Reykjavik (1984) * Listmunah√∫si√∞, Reykjav√≠k (1985) * Gallery Hallger√∞ur, Reykjav√≠k (1986) * Bromfield Gallery, Boston (1986) * The Living Art Museum, Reykjavik (1987) * Hal Bromm Gallery, New York (1988) * Reykjav√≠k Art Museum, Reykjav√≠k (1991) * The Living Art Museum, Reykjavik (1992) * Galerie Alain Gutharc, Paris (1994) * Galleri Isidor, Malm√∂ (1995) * Gallery S√¶var Karl, Reykjavik (1996) * Galerie Philippe Rizzo, Paris (1997) * Gallery S√¶var Karl, Reykjav√≠k (2000) * K√≥pavogur Art Museum, Reykjav√≠k (2003) * Gallery Turpentine, Reykjav√≠k (2006) * Gallery Turpentine, Reykjav√≠k (2007) * Gallery Icelandic Contemporary Art, Reykjav√≠k (2009) * Gerduberg Culture Center, Reykjavik (2012) * Tveir hrafnar listh√∫s, Reykjavik (2013) * Gallery Christoffer Egelund, Copenhagen (2015) * Tveir hrafnar listh√∫s, Reykjavik (2015) ===Selected Group Shows=== * \\"Young Artists\\", Reykjav√≠k Art Museum, Reykjav√≠k (1983) * \\"New Painting\\", JL-house, Reykjav√≠k 1983 * Now Gallery, New York (1985) * Hal Bromm Gallery, New York (1986) * Stux Gallery, Boston (1987) * Galerie Leger, Malm√∂ (1987) * \\"Icelandic Artists\\", Privatbanken, New York (1987) * \\"Icelandic Artists\\", V√§xj√∂ Konsthall, V√§xj√∂, Sweden (1992) * \\"Aurora 5\\", Joensuu, Finland (1992) * \\"Art Hotel\\", Hilton Hotel, Amsterdam (1994) * \\"Bazar du jour\\", Galerie du Jour, Paris (1995) * \\"L'art d'aimer\\", Espace Paul Boy√©, S√©te, France (1995) * Galerie Alain Gutharc, Paris (1995) * \\"Wolemi- Pine\\", K√≥pavogur Art Museum (1995) * \\"Selfportraits, Mocca-Caf√©, Reykjavik (1997) * \\"Mutants\\", Galerie Philippe Rizzo, Paris (1997) * \\"Colorblind\\", Salle de Bains, Rotterdam (1997) * \\"Fl√∂g√∞ og f√∂gur skinn\\", The Living Art Museum, Reykjavik (1998) * \\"Ainsi de suite 3\\", Centre d'art, S√©te, FRance (1999) * \\"Hot Spot\\", Kulturbahnhof Eller, D√ºsseldorf (1999) * \\"Tilfelli\\", Epal, Reykjav√≠k (2000) * \\"Hors les cartes\\", Centre R√©gional d'art, S√©te, France (2000) * \\"The Golden Brush\\", Thorshavn, Faroe Islands (2002) * \\"Des del confins de la terra\\", La Capella, Barcelona (2004) * \\"Bye Bye, Iceland\\", Akureyri Art Museum (2008) * \\"Icelandic Contemporary Portraits, Akureyri Art Museum, (2014) * \\"Just Painted 2\\", Reykjav√≠k Art Museum, Reykjav√≠k (2016) * \\"Whatever...

It was released in 1994, and was the sequel to the previous year's Duets. Phil Ramone produced the album and guest artists from various genres contributed their duet parts to Sinatra's already recorded vocals. Though not as commercially successful as Duets, it still rose to #9 on the Billboard albums chart and sold over 1 million copies in the U.S. It also peaked at #29 in the UK. Critical notices were again mixed at best, although some viewed it as an improvement over its predecessor. However, the album won Sinatra the 1995 Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance, his last competitive Grammy Award. These would be the last studio recordings made by Sinatra, who had begun his recording career fifty-four years earlier. Both were packaged together in a \\"90th Birthday Limited Collector's Edition\\" released in 2005; North American pressings add an unreleased duet recording of \\"My Way\\" with Willie Nelson, while international pressings have him singing with Luciano Pavarotti. ==Track listing== Unless otherwise indicated, Information is based on Liner notesSinatra, Frank. ‚ÄúDuets II‚Äù.

The first issue, issued on 14 March 1931, contained a manifesto in which National Syndicalism was elaborated. Ledesma's idea was to win over the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT), the then dominant trade union movement in the country, to a form of national corporatism. The ideas in the essay were discussed during the CNT congress in the summer of 1931 without being approved. On the other hand, despite the magazine being inspired from the views of Adolf Hitler, the founders of the magazine did not endorse his views on racism and argued that it should be replaced with the notion of Spain's imperial past. Members of the organizing committee of La Conquista del Estado were Ramiro Ledesma Ramos (president), Juan Aparicio L√≥pez (secretary), Ernesto Gim√©nez Caballero, Ricardo de Jaspe Santoma, Manuel Souto Vilas, Antonio Berm√∫dez Ca√±ete, Francisco Mateos Gonz√°lez, Alejandro M. Raim√∫ndez, Ram√≥n Iglesias Parga, Antonio Ria√±o Lanzarote and Roberto Escribano Ortega. The small group around La Conquista del Estado was based in the universities of Madrid. On 10 October the group around La Conquista del Estado merged with the Valladolid-based Junta Castellana de Actuaci√≥n Hisp√°nica to form the Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional- Sindicalista.

The novel centers upon three historical events: the Emperor Domitian‚Äôs war with the Germanic Chattian tribe in 83 A.D.; the inauguration of the Colosseum, or Amphitheatrum Flavium; and the assassination of Domitian. In dramatizing the assassination, the author follows the details given by first-century Roman historian Suetonius. ==Plot summary== The fictional protagonists are a proto- Germanic tribeswoman, Auriane, daughter of a Chattian war leader; and Marcus Arrius Julianus, a Roman senator and imperial advisor whose character and circumstances are loosely based on the Roman philosopher Seneca, as well as another contemporary in the reign of Nero, Stoic philosopher and statesman Helvidius Priscus, a man known for his outspokenness in public life. Rome‚Äôs interference in tribal affairs compel Auriane to take the warrior‚Äôs oath and lead her father‚Äôs retinue after his death. In Rome, Stoic humanist Marcus Julianus reaches the highest levels of government, where he is taken into the confidence of the Emperor Domitian. Through political maneuvering, he attempts to check the excesses of the increasingly corrupt Emperor Domitian. Auriane is captured in Domitian's Chattian War and taken to Rome. As Domitian's reign of terror begins, Julianus orchestrates a plot to assassinate the Emperor; here the author has inserted a fictional character into a gap left by history. The Emperor Domitian, who according to Suetonius, was fond of pitting women against dwarfs in the arena, condemns Auriane to a gladiatorial school. Here Auriane discovers the tribesman who betrayed her people in war. As Julianus‚Äô assassination plot reaches its conclusion, Auriane must carry out the tribal rite of vengeance in the Colosseum. ==Reception== The book has sold over 350,000 copies worldwide, and has been translated into German, Dutch, Russian and Italian. In 1994-95 it spent 18 weeks on Germany‚Äôs Buchreport bestseller list. In 2001, The Light Bearer was optioned by Hallmark Entertainment for a four-hour television miniseries that was not produced. In general, reviews were positive; it received a ‚Äústarred‚Äù review in Publishers Weekly.

A camping coach was positioned here by the London Midland Region from 1960 to 1964. Goods traffic ceased here in June 1964, but it remained open for passenger services. The station building was demolished in 1987, during construction work for the A55 North Wales Coast dual carriageway which runs next to the railway at this location - the site was also altered (the retaining wall for the road backs directly onto the eastbound platform) and the station temporarily closed as a consequence of this. The station reopened once the work was complete. The original station footbridge still stands, but the other surviving structures all date from the 1987 alterations. ==Facilities== There are no permanent buildings left here now other than the footbridge and a stone shelter on each side, the station being unstaffed and a request stop. Tickets must be purchased from the guard on the train or prior to travel, as there is no ticket machine present. Train running details are offered via telephone, digital display screens or timetable poster boards.

They held, for the English Crown, Tynedale to the Cumbrian Border up to the border with Scotland. It was in Scotland where the Umfravilles reached the pinnacle of their power. As a prominent border landowning family, it is likely that they were invited, along with dozens of other Anglo-Norman knights, administrators, and warlords to settle in Scotland by David I of Scotland as part of his policy of modernising Scotland by introducing feudalism, now known as the Davidian Revolution by historians. The Umfravilles, who were granted lands in Stirlingshire, were by the third generation established as members of Court and for three generations became Mormaer of Angus Earl of Angus through marriage into the Scots-Gaelic aristocracy. The split loyalties between the Kings of Scotland and the Kings of England meant the family frequently found itself as unsettled as the border and this game to a head during the Wars of Scottish Independence where they fought for both Scotland and England at various points of the conflict (as did the de Brus family). Perhaps coming from the French village of Offranville in Normandy, traditions of their origins and early exploits appearing in past writers are fanciful. According to Mark Antony Lower, the founder of the family in England was Robert de Umfraville, called Robert \\"with the Beard\\" (cum Barba), who came into England with William the Conqueror.Lower, Mark Antony (1860). Patronymica Britannica: A Dictionary of the Family Names of the United Kingdom. London: J.R. Smith. pp. 360‚Äì61. There is a possible connection with another Umfraville family in Glamorgan. ==Principal members== ===Robert I (died in or after 1145)=== The first historical member of the family, he held the lordships of Prudhoe and Redesdale for King Henry I in England and also acquired interests in Scotland. Associated there with King David I and his son Henry, lands in Stirlingshire held by his descendants were probably granted then. He is taken to be the father of Odinel I and Gilbert I. ===Odinel I (died in or after 1166)=== Succeeding his father Robert I in England, he was also active in Scotland, being associated there with King David I and his grandson King Malcolm IV. He left no children. ===Gilbert I (died in or after 1175)=== Succeeding his brother Odinel I after 1166, he had made his career mostly in Scotland, and was presumably the father of Odinel II. ===Odinel II (died 1182)=== Succeeding his presumed father Gilbert I after 1175, he had been raised in Scotland, initially serving in the household of King William I. He married Alice, daughter of the justiciar Richard Lucy, and had four or five sons, including Robert II and Richard, and at least three daughters, one being Alice who married William Bertram of Mitford. At his death in 1182 his estates in Northumberland alone were valued at nearly ¬£60 a year and other English lands in Yorkshire, Suffolk, and Rutland may have doubled that, making him a wealthy magnate. ===Robert II (died in or before 1195)=== Succeeding his father Odinel II in 1182, he left no children. ===Richard (died 1226)=== Succeeding his brother Robert II around 1195, he was among the northern barons who resisted the exactions of King John and came under suspicion of treachery, being required in 1212 to hand over to the king his sons and his castle of Prudhoe. By 1216 he joined the rebels fighting John and his lands were forfeit, though he later made peace with the government of King Henry III. With a wife whose name is unknown he had at least four sons, including Gilbert II, and two daughters. ===Gilbert II, Earl of Angus (died 1245)=== Succeeding his father Richard in 1226, his first wife was Tiffany, a member of the Balliol family. After she died, in 1243 he married Maud, widow of John Comyn and daughter of Malcolm, Earl of Angus, who was the mother of his only son, Gilbert III. He is usually called Earl of Angus in right of his wife, who remarried after his death. ===Gilbert III Earl of Angus (died 1307 or 1308)=== Succeeding his father Gilbert II in 1245 while still an infant, he married Elizabeth, daughter of Alexander Comyn, Earl of Buchan and their second son was Robert III. His effigy can be seen in Hexham Abbey ===Robert III Earl of Angus (died 1325)=== Succeeding his father Gilbert III in 1307, he married first Lucy, daughter of Sir Philip Kyme, and secondly Eleanor, daughter of Robert Lumley. With his first wife he had a son Gilbert IV and with his second wife a son Thomas I. ===Gilbert IV (died 1381)=== Succeeding his father Robert III in 1325, he married first Joan, daughter of Sir Robert Willoughby, and secondly Maud, daughter of Sir Thomas Lucy. With Joan he had a son Robert, who died before him. ===Thomas I (died 1387)=== Succeeding his half-brother Gilbert IV in 1381, he married Joan, daughter of Adam Roddam, and had two sons Thomas II and Robert IV. ===Thomas II (died 1391)=== Succeeding his father Thomas I in 1387, he married Agnes (died 1420), daughter of Sir Thomas Grey and his wife Margaret Pressene, and had a son Gilbert V. A daughter Maud married Sir William Ryther, of Ryther. He died on 12 February 1391. ===Gilbert V (died 1421)=== Succeeding his father Thomas II in 1391, in 1413 he married Anne, daughter of Ralph Nevill, 1st Earl of Westmorland, and his wife Margaret, daughter of Hugh Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford. They had no children, and he died fighting the French at Baug√© in 1421. ===Robert IV (died 1437)=== Succeeding his nephew Gilbert V in 1421, his wife was named Isabel and they had no children. He was the last of the family and his lands passed to Sir William Tailboys, a remote cousin.A first cousin three times removed, William was the great-great-grandson of Robert's aunt Elizabeth (died before 1337) who had married Sir Gilbert Burradon. ==Arms== In 1245 the Umfraville arms were recorded as: gules, a cinquefoil pierced or in a bordure azure, the bordure being sometimes shown charged with horseshoes. Horse breeding was a major activity of the family in England. ==References== Category:English families Umfraville Category:People from Northumberland ","title":"Umfraville"},{"id":"3254930","text":"Gillian \\"Gill\\" Cowley (born July 8, 1955 in Kitwe, Northern Rhodesia) is a former hockey player from Zimbabwe, who was a member of the national team that won the gold medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.

He served under James Cook on his last voyage around the world, specialising in taking important astronomical readings using a sextant. After Cook died he helped lead the ships on the remainder of their course, also completing Cook's account of the voyage. He continued his career in the Navy, reaching the rank of post-captain, commanding several ships and serving in the American War of Independence. ==Early life== King was born in Clitheroe, Lancashire, in 1750, the son of James King, who was at that time curate of St Mary Magdalene, Clitheroe. According to the parish registers young James King was baptised on 13 July 1750, presumably shortly after his birth. At an early age King entered Clitheroe Royal Grammar School, where he remained until he was 12 years old. ==The Navy== King entered the navy on 19 November 1762 under the patronage of his kinsman William Norton, serving under him first in as an able seaman, although in fact he was treated as a junior officer, and then as a midshipman in the William and Mary. After further service as an able seaman or midshipman in and , King joined , Captain James Chads, on 15 March 1768 as an able seaman for service on the Newfoundland Station under Hugh Palliser, a commodore and friend and patron of James Cook, but there is no indication that Cook and King met at this time. It has been said that King served aboard in the Mediterranean under Captain John Jervis but there is no evidence of this. Having passed for lieutenant on 7 March 1769, King was promoted to this rank on 10 January 1771, serving in several ships before being placed on half pay in May 1773. He was then granted leave to go abroad on his private affairs for one year, visiting Paris before joining his elder brother Thomas in Auxerre. This was followed by a period with his brother Walker King at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he was introduced to Thomas Hornsby, a priest and Savilian Professor of Astronomy, by his uncle by marriage, Fletcher Norton, 1st Baron Grantley, Speaker of the House of Commons and member of the Board of Longitude, who recommended him for Cook's third voyage. ==Service on Captain Cook's third voyage== King joined as second lieutenant, sharing the duties of astronomer with Cook, taking astronomical observations on board by sextant and with Larcum Kendal's timekeeper K1, to establish the Resolutions position at sea and on shore by sextant or by astronomical quadrant to establish the geographical position of salient points during the course of Cook's surveys. Thus King's geographical positions were an important contribution to the accuracy of the various surveys carried out during the voyage and his use of the early chronometers helped prove their use at sea for calculation of Longitude. . Following the death of Cook, King remained in the Resolution but on the death of Charles Clerke, Cook's successor, King was appointed to command , the Resolutions consort, remaining in her for the rest of the voyage. After his return to England King was very much involved in the publication of the official account of Cook's third voyage, writing the third volume at Woodstock, near Oxford, where his brother Thomas was rector of St Mary Magdalene. But shortly after his return King was promoted Post-captain and appointed commander of in the English Channel. ==Later life== Then towards the end of 1781 King was appointed commander of the 40-gun and escorted a fleet of merchantmen to the West Indies. He captured a French frigate, La Coquette, off Turks Island before returning to England at the end of the American Revolutionary War in 1783 with his health much impaired. King then returned to Woodstock to continue to work on Cook's third voyage. After the publication of the three-volume account of the voyage, advancing tuberculosis drove him to Nice, accompanied by his friends James Trevenen, who had served with him in the Resolution and Discovery, and Captain William Young, who had served with him in the Guernsey, where he died on 16 November 1784 at the age of 34, although the memorial tablet in Woodstock parish church states erroneously that he died in his 32nd year. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1782 in recognition of his astronomical observations during Cook's third voyage he was also made an honorary L.L.D. Trinity College, Dublin, after donating his collection of Pacific Artifacts to the college. ==References== Category:1750 births Category:1784 deaths Category:People from Clitheroe Category:English explorers of North America Category:English sailors Category:English astronomers Category:Explorers of Australia Category:Explorers of Canada Category:English explorers of the Pacific Category:Royal Navy officers Category:Royal Navy personnel of the American Revolutionary War Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:People educated at Clitheroe Royal Grammar School Category:James Cook ","title":"James King (Royal Navy officer)"},{"id":"3254944","text":"Sarah English (born November 28, 1955) is a former field hockey player from Zimbabwe, who was a member of the national team that won the gold medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.

An \\"obstack\\" is a \\"stack\\" of \\"objects\\" (data items) which is dynamically managed. It implements a region-based memory management scheme. Obstack code typically provides C macros which take care of memory allocation and management for the user. Basically, obstacks are used as a form of memory management which can be more efficient and less difficult to implement than malloc/free in several situations. For example, say one needs to set up a stack for handling data items whose number grows for a while and then reach a final form; such a stack could be defined in obstack.h. ==Freeing allocated objects== Once the object is allocated a new chunk of memory in obstack it must be freed after its use. ==Functions and macros== The interfaces for using obstacks may be defined either as functions or as macros, depending on the compiler. The obstack facility works with all C compilers. In an old-fashioned non-ISO C compiler, all the obstack functions are actually defined only as macros. You can call these macros like functions, but you cannot use them in any other way. For example, you cannot take their address. Calling the macros requires a special precaution: namely, the first operand (the obstack pointer) should not contain any side effects, because it may be computed more than once. In ISO C, each obstack function has both a macro definition and a function definition. The function definition is used if the macro substitution fails. An ordinary call uses the macro definition by default, but you can request the function definition instead by writing the function name in parentheses, as shown here: char *x; void *(*funcp)(); x = obstack_alloc(obptr, size); /* Use the macro. */ x = (obstack_alloc) (obptr, size); /* Call the function. */ funcp = obstack_alloc; /* Take the address of the function. */ This is the same situation that exists in ISO C for the standard library functions. == Growing Objects == Since the memory chunks in an obstack are used sequentially, it is possible to build up an object by adding data of size 'bytes' at the end of it. This technique of step by step building up of an object is termed as 'growing an object'. == References == ==External links== * Obstacks - The GNU C Library Category:Abstract data types ","title":"Obstack"},{"id":"3254956","text":"Ann-Mary Gwynne Grant (n√©e Fletcher; born May 6, 1955) is a former field hockey player from Zimbabwe, who captained the national team that won the gold medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.

It was completed along with the rest of the IRT Lenox Avenue Line, then known as the East Side Subway or East Side Branch, south of 145th Street. Starting on March 2, 1998, the tunnel was reconstructed along with the cracked tunnel floor, and the 116th Street station was closed for a complete renovation. This was done to correct a major water problem that had existed for many years due to the presence of the Harlem Creek and other underground streams, which caused extensive flooding, water damage, and seepage problems that occasionally contributed to severe service disruptions. The project cost $82 million and was finished on October 12, 1998. During the reconstruction, many trains were rerouted via the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, while the trains were rerouted to the 137th Street‚ÄìCity College station on the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line.

Mattar's career-high rankings were World No. 29 in singles (in 1989) and World No. 55 in doubles (in 1991). His career prize money totalled $1,493,136. With seven ATP singles titles in tournaments of the Association of Professional Tennis Players, he is the second Brazilian tennis player, after Gustavo Kuerten, with more ATP titles in his career. He also lead the Brazilian Davis Cup team to their best result in history back in 1992 defeating Germany and Italy and reaching the semi-final of the World Group in the 1992 Davis Cup. This feat has only been matched by Gustavo Kuerten who lead the Brazilian team again to the semi-final in 2000. He started his professional career only at the age of 22, unlike most tennis players who started their careers at 18 or earlier, after dropping out in his last year of engineering at Mackenzie Presbyterian University in S√£o Paulo. He was trained by Paulo Cleto from the beginning to the end of his career. He even said that he couldn't see himself training with another coach.

It is served by the 2 and 3 trains at all times. ==History== This station opened just after midnight on November 23, 1904, as part of the IRT's original system. It was completed along with the rest of the IRT Lenox Avenue Line, then known as the East Side Subway or East Side Branch, south of 145th Street. Starting on March 2, 1998, the tunnel was reconstructed along with the cracked tunnel floor. This was done to correct a major water problem that had existed for many years due to the presence of the Harlem Creek and other underground streams, which caused extensive flooding, water damage, and seepage problems that occasionally contributed to severe service disruptions. The project cost $82 million and was finished on October 12, 1998. During the reconstruction, many trains were rerouted via the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, while the trains were rerouted to the 137th Street‚ÄìCity College station on the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line. Each of the two Lenox Avenue Line tracks were alternately taken out of service and supplemental shuttle bus service connecting to other lines in the area were provided for much of this time. ===2020 fire=== On March 27, 2020, a northbound 2 train caught fire as it entered the Central Park North‚Äì110th Street station, killing the operator, injuring at least 16 others, and damaging the station. The incident was investigated as a possible arson, as several other fires had been observed in nearby stations. ==Station layout== {table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=50G style=\\"border- top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=100Street level style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=400Exit/entrance - style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" rowspan=5 valign=topP Platform level style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"Northbound style=\\"border- top:solid 1px gray;\\"‚Üê toward () ‚Üê toward () - style=\\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\\" colspan=2Island platform - style=\\"border-left:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\\" colspan=2 { cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=100% width=20% style=\\"border:solid 1px gray;\\" align=centerFare control, station agent width=20% } - style=\\"border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\\" colspan=2Island platform - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"Southbound style=\\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" toward () ‚Üí toward ( late nights) () ‚Üí } The entrance on 110th Street-Central Park North station This underground station is the southernmost station on the Lenox Avenue Line. South of this station, the line turns southwest under the Great Hill and North Woods of Central Park, then west under 104th Street, and then south once again at Broadway, merging with the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line to become the express tracks of that line. This has two tracks and an island platform. The platform is wider at its south end than at its north, where it was extended in the 1950s and the tracks curve. Both track walls have some of the original, hanging mosaic designs and the platform has a line of red circular columns in the middle. The station's artwork, installed during a 1998 renovation, is called Message from Malcolm by Maren Hassinger. It consists of mosaic panels on the platform and main fare control area's street stairs that depict quotes and writings by Malcolm X written in script and surrounded by mosaic borders. ===Exits=== This station has two fare control areas, both of which are on platform level: * The full-time one is at the south end and has a bank of four turnstiles, token booth, and double-wide staircase going up to the northwest corner of Central Park North and Malcolm X Boulevard. * A full height turnstile at the center of the platform leads to a staircase that goes up to the northwest corner of West 111th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard. == References == == External links == * * nycsubway.org ‚Äì Message from Malcolm Artwork by Maren Hassinger (1998) * Station Reporter ‚Äî 2 Train * Station Reporter ‚Äî 3 Train * The Subway Nut ‚Äì Central Park North‚Äì110th Street Pictures * MTA's Arts For Transit ‚Äì Central Park North‚Äì110th Street (IRT Lenox Avenue Line) * 110th Street (Central Park North) entrance from Google Maps Street View * 111th Street entrance from Google Maps Street View * Platform from Google Maps Street View Category:1904 establishments in New York (state) Category:Harlem Category:IRT Lenox Avenue Line stations Central Park North‚Äì110th Street station Category:New York City Subway stations located underground Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1904 ","title":"Central Park North‚Äì110th Street station"},{"id":"3255015","text":"Linda Margaret Watson (born September 15, 1955) is a former field hockey player from Zimbabwe, who was a member of the national team that won the gold medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.

On 2 November 1939, after the Soviet invasion of Poland, the territories of West Belarus were annexed by the Soviet Union. The local population remained disaffected towards the Soviet occupants, so when Germany invaded the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, many people organized around the Belarusian Central Council, a Belarusian representative council in the Nazi-occupied Belarus, Vitu≈°ka among them. In August 1941 he became one of the commanders of the Belarusian Self-Defense units formed in the Western part of Belarus. He was also a chief organizer of the Belarusian Auxiliary Police in Minsk. From 1942 to 1943 he organized Belarusian forces in Bryansk, Smolensk and Mogilev. He also became a part of the Belarusian Self-Help and had the rank of a major in the Byelorussian Home Defence. He took part in the 2nd Belarusian congress and beginning in the late summer of 1944 was also the officer of the Dallwitz parachute battalion.

They were trained in Dahlwitz near Berlin by SS-Standartenf√ºhrer Otto Skorzeny. The paratroopers came from Reichskommissariat Ostland; and were split into commandos based on the country of origin. As part of the Nazi effort to combat the growing Soviet partisan movement in Belarus during the war, some thirty Belarusians from the espionage and sabotage outfit known as \\"ƒåorny Kot\\" (Black Cat) led by Micha≈Ç Vitu≈°ka age 37, were airdropped by the Luftwaffe in late 1944 behind the lines of the Red Army. At that time, the German forces had been expelled from the present-day Belarus during Operation Bagration. Black Cats experienced some initial successes due to disorganization in the rear of the Red Army. Other German- trained Belarusian nationalist units also slipped through the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest in 1945.Perry Biddiscombe: The SS Hunter Battalions.

However, the NKVD secret police informants infiltrated these units. As the result, they were ambushed and killed in short order. At the beginning of the 1950s most of the leaders of the resistance movement had to escape to the West.

Sinuses are mucosa-lined airspaces within the bones of the face and skull. Each opens into the anterior part of the corresponding middle nasal meatus of the nose through the frontonasal duct which traverses the anterior part of the labyrinth of the ethmoid. These structures then open into the semilunar hiatus in the middle meatus. ==Structure== Frontal sinus. Frontal sinuses are rarely symmetrical and the septum between them frequently deviates to one or other side of the middle line. Their average measurements are as follows: height 28 mm, breadth 24 mm, depth 20 mm, creating a space of 6-7 ml.University of Texas Medical Branch The mucous membrane in this sinus is innervated by the supraorbital nerve, which carries the postganglionic parasympathetic nerve fibers for mucous secretion from the ophthalmic nerve and supplied by the supraorbital artery and anterior ethmoidal artery. ===Development=== The frontal sinuses are absent at birth, but are generally fairly well developed between the seventh and eighth years, only reaching their full size after puberty.Human Anatomy, Jacobs, Elsevier, 2008, page 210 The frontal bone is membranous at birth and there is rarely more than a recess until the bone tissue starts to ossify about age two. Consequently, this structure does not show on radiographs before that time. Sinus development begins in the womb, the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses are present at birth. Sphenoidal sinuses are present at birth as well but are very small. Approximately 5% of people have absent frontal sinuses. ==Function== Through its copious mucus production, the sinus is an essential part of the immune defense/air filtration carried out by the nose. Nasal and sinal mucosae are ciliated and move mucus to the choanae and finally to the stomach. The thick upper layers of nasal mucus trap bacteria and small particles in tissue abundantly provided with immune cells, antibodies, and antibacterial proteins. The layers beneath are thinner and provide a substrate in which the cilia are able to beat and move the upper layer with its debris through the ostia toward the choanae. ==Clinical significance== Infection of the frontal sinus causing sinusitis can give rise to serious complications, as it is in close proximity to the orbit and cranial cavity (orbital cellulitis, epidural and subdural abscess, meningitis). Endonasal approach into the frontal sinus in children with acute and chronic frontal sinusitis without the usage of surgical optics is not successful, because in this case the operation is performed almost blindly and technically difficult even in adults. ===Fractures=== Frontal sinus fractures occur from trauma to the part of the frontal bone that overlies the sinus, often from motor vehicle accidents and falls. The hallmarks of a frontal sinus fracture is a frontal depression in the anterior table of the bone. Additionally, clear fluid leaking from the nose may indicate that fractures to the posterior table have torn into the dura mater, creating a cerebrospinal fluid leak. Goals in management are to protect the intracranial structure, control any existing CSF leakage, prevent late complications, and aesthetically correct the deformity caused, if any. In anterior table fractures, if the table is minimally displaced, there will be no treatment necessary, only observation. If largely displaced, the correction is open reduction and internal fixation. If inhibiting the nasofrontal outflow tract, procedure is to undergo open reduction and internal fixation of the anterior table and osteoplastic flap with obliteration. In posterior table fractures, a nondiplaced fracture with no CSF leak will only be observed. Those with a CSF leak will undergo sinus exploration if the CSF leak is not internally resolved within 4 to 7 days. With more dramatic displacements, sinus exploration will be required to determine the required level of cranialization, obliteration, and reparation to the dura. ===Aesthetic reconstruction=== In the case of facial feminization surgery, modifications to the frontal sinus can be made to make the face more feminine, alongside softening the orbital rims. The forehead operations for feminization were first described by Dr. Douglas Ousterhout in the 1980s. Those operations consisted of four different techniques based on the anatomy of the patient. They were named arbitrarily by number (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3 and Type 4), with no particular relevance to their level of difficulty or frequency. * Type 1 The Type I forehead describes a forehead with an absent frontal sinus or alternatively with sufficiently thick bone overlaying the frontal sinus so that burring alone is enough to correct the forehead. This type of forehead tends to occur in approximately 3% to 5% of the population. In these situations, the operation consists of using rotary instruments to shape and contour the bone to the desired level, while observing the thickness of the bone to avoid penetrating the intracranial space. The main risks associated with this operation tend to be bleeding. There are often venous lakes present throughout the frontal bone. * Type 2 The Type II forehead describes another uncommon situation. This describes a patient with brow bossing; however, the bossing is at the correction position in terms of prominence. Therefore, the problem lies primarily above the bossing. We see this forehead type at about the same frequency as we see the Type I forehead. The Type II forehead is corrected by using a filling material such as methyl methacrylate.7 Other materials may be more ideal at this point; however, none are superior in terms of cost to methyl methacrylate. Although many surgeons do not consider the cost of the materials they are using, hydroxyapatite and calcium phos-phate bone cements cost approximately 1000 times that of methyl methacrylate. The advantage of bone cement is its adherence to the underlying bone, and the more analogous nature to native bone substrate. The material is applied to fill in the area above the bossing, and then gently contoured to blend with the transverse forehead bossing thereby-creating a uniformly round forehead * Type 3 The Type III forehead is the most common situation and occurs in more than 90% of patients. The forehead, in this situation, has a prominent bossing across the top of the brows, and that bossing is overly projected. A frontal sinus is present. The thinness of the sinus precludes using exclusively rotary instruments to thin the bone. An osteotomy and reconstruction are the only operations to provide the proper round shape to the forehead with the decreased prominence that is necessary for a soft forehead, which involves a setback of the anterior table of the frontal sinus. * Type 4 This operation can be described as an extended Type II operation. In this situation, the entire forehead is diminutive, including the area underlying the brows, and the entire forehead requires augmentation. Regardless of the material type, care should be taken to avoid having the implant sit directly underneath the incision as this leads to a higher rate of infection and removal. Treatment of the orbital rim is almost always necessary in all these various forehead operations, regardless of what is done with the frontal bossing. Deschamps- Braly JC.

In this speech, which was first delivered in 1859, Frederick Douglass gives his own definition of the self-made man and explains what he thinks are the means to become such a man. The concept of the self-made man is deeply rooted in the American Dream. Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, is sometimes said to have created the concept of the self-made man. In his Autobiography, he describes his way from a poor, unknown son of a candle-maker to a very successful business man and highly acknowledged member of the American society. Franklin creates the archetype of someone coming from low origins, who, against all odds, breaks out of his inherited social position, climbs up the social ladder and creates a new identity for himself. Key factors in this rise from rags to riches are hard work and a solid moral foundation. Franklin also stresses the significance of education for self-improvement. ==Douglass' View== Douglass stresses the low origins of the self-made man, who has not inherited his social position by birth or other favourable circumstances, but who achieves everything without any outside assistance: > Self-made men ... are the men who owe little or nothing to birth, > relationship, friendly surroundings; to wealth inherited or to early > approved means of education; who are what they are, without the aid of any > of the favoring conditions by which other men usually rise in the world and > achieve great results. (pp549-50) In addition, Douglass does not believe in what he calls the \\"good luck theory\\" (p552), which attributes success to chance and friendly circumstances. He believes that \\"opportunity is important but exertion is indispensable\\" (p553). It is not luck that makes a man a self-made man, but considerable physical and mental effort. Similar to Franklin's virtue of industry, Douglass underlines the importance of hard work as a necessary means to achieve success. He remarks that \\"there is nothing good, great or desirable ..., that does not come by some kind of labor\\" (p555). Douglass is convinced that success can be explained by only one word, namely \\"work!\\" (p556) He further argues that there is a natural hierarchy of men. An ambitious man will naturally, through hard work, climb the social ladder, whereas the unmotivated man will not improve his position: \\"the man who will get up will be helped up; and the man who will not get up will be allowed to stay down\\" (p557). Applying this theory to the situation of the African-Americans, Douglass remarks: \\"Give the negro fair play and let him alone. If he lives, well. If he dies, equally well. If he cannot stand up, let him fall down.\\" (p557) Yet, Douglass admits that industry is not the only explanation of the phenomenon of the self-made man. In his opinion, necessity is what urges a man to achieve more. Moreover, favourable circumstances are counterproductive to one's resolution to get ahead. Ease and luxury rather lead to helplessness and inactivity and an inactive man can never become a self-made man. \\"As a general rule, where circumstances do most for men there man will do least for himself; and where man does least, he himself is least. His doing makes or unmakes him.\\"(p558) However, though acknowledging that there are other factors for success such as \\"order, the first law of heaven\\" (562), Douglass insists that hard work is the most important of them all, without which all others would fail: > My theory of self-made men is, then, simply this; that they are men of work. > Whether or not such men have acquired material, moral or intellectual > excellence, honest labor faithfully, steadily and persistently pursued, is > the best, if not the only, explanation of their success. (p560) Thus, like Franklin, Douglass arrives at his moral principles. According to him, \\"the principles of honor, integrity and affection\\" (p561) are the essential prerequisite for enduring success: > All human experience proves over and over again, that any success which > comes through meanness, trickery, fraud and dishonour, is but emptiness and > will only be a torment to its possessor. (p561) ==Differences between Douglass and Franklin== Despite all these similarities between Douglass' and Franklin's concept of the self-made man, the two men differ in their emphasis on relationships to other men. Before Douglass even gives his definition of the self-made man, he remarks, \\"Properly speaking, there are in the world no such men as self-made men.\\" (p549) > It must in truth be said though it may not accord well with self-conscious > individuality and self-conceit, that no possible native force of character, > and no depth or wealth of originality, can lift a man into absolute > independence of his fellow-men, and no generation of men can be independent > of the preceding generation. (p549) Whereas Franklin does not put a strong emphasis on relationships, for Douglass, they are a matter of the utmost importance. Douglass understands himself as part of a larger entity and highlights what he calls the \\"brotherhood and inter-dependence of mankind\\" (p549). Comparing the relationship between an individual and the masses to that between a wave and the ocean, Douglass explains that, though we differ like the waves, we all depend on each other and the power and greatness of each individual derives exactly from this interdependence. Since all men complement each other in their abilities and strengths, Douglass further argues that \\"the balance of power is kept comparatively even, and a self-acting brotherhood and interdependence is maintained.\\" (p549) ==See also== *Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave (1845), Douglass' first book *My Bondage and My Freedom (1855), Douglass' next memoir *The Heroic Slave, a heartwarming Narrative of the Adventures of Madison Washington, in Pursuit of Liberty, (1852), a fiction book by Douglass based on the experiences of Madison Washington. *Rags to riches *Novus homo - A similar concept in Roman and Renaissance social philosophy ==References== *Douglass, Frederick (2003): \\"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, Written by Himself\\".

It sits on the Northern shore of the fjord of the same name, is part of the municipality of Fjar√∞abygg√∞ and has less than 200 inhabitants. ==History== St√∂√∞varfj√∂r√∞ur is recorded in the Landn√°mab√≥k as having been settled by √û√≥rhaddur 'The Old' from Trondheim. Archaeological investigation of the site at the farm St√∂√∞ in St√∂√∞varfj√∂r√∞ur has revealed two Viking-age longhouses, the older of which was (from C-14 dating) built shortly after the year 800. It is thought that the settlement was a seasonal camp for fishing and hunting, rather than a permanent settlement. The modern village arose later on the North shore of the fjord. ==Geography== St√∂√∞varfj√∂r√∞ur has a harbour and (since the reclassification of Route 96 (Su√∞urfjar√∞arvegur) in November 2017) lies on Route 1, at the foot of Hellufjall (859m). Most of the village lies on or close to the main street, Fjar√∞arbraut. The other villages composing the municipality are: Eskifj√∂r√∞ur (1,043 inh.), F√°skr√∫√∞sfj√∂r√∞ur (662 inh.), Mj√≥ifj√∂r√∞ur (35 inh.), Neskaupsta√∞ur (1,437 inh.),Located in the Nor√∞fj√∂r√∞ur and Rey√∞arfj√∂r√∞ur (1,102 inh.). Infos on Fjar√∞abygg√∞ municipal website The nearest weather station (with road webcams) is at Kambaskri√∞ur. The nearest airport with scheduled flights is Egilssta√∞ir Airport, which is 75 km (47 mi) away and can be reached within an hour's drive. Air Iceland operates two or three daily flights from Reykjav√≠k to Egilssta√∞ir or vice versa and the flight is 1 hour long. There is an unscheduled and unused airport with a grass runway in Brei√∞dalsv√≠k, 20 km (12 mi) from St√∂√∞varfj√∂r√∞ur. Hornafj√∂r√∞ur Airport in H√∂fn, which is 180 km (112 mi) away and takes two hours to reach by car. Eagle Air operates two daily flights from Reykjav√≠k to H√∂fn on weekdays with the exception of Tuesday, and one flight on Sundays. Additional flights can be scheduled on specific days in the summer. Reykjav√≠k is 620 km (385 mi) away. It takes 7 hours and 30 minutes to drive from Reykjav√≠k. It takes 12 hours by bus as one needs to change the buses and take the bus to Reykjav√≠k in H√∂fn. The buses connecting Egilssta√∞ir to H√∂fn stop in St√∂√∞varfj√∂r√∞ur alongside other villages. ===Climate=== The climate seen in St√∂√∞varfj√∂r√∞ur and nearby areas is Tundra climate (ET) because no month has a daily mean above . However, precipitation and winter temperatures have subpolar oceanic (Cfc) characteristics. From November to March, St√∂√∞varfj√∂r√∞ur is warmer than Reykjav√≠k, even though Reykjav√≠k has an annual mean temperature 1 ¬∞C higher than St√∂√∞varfj√∂r√∞ur. ==Economy== Employment was once predominantly found in fishing, though now it is largely textile-based. Most of the young people have left, thus the community youth hall has been closed due to disuse. Steinasafn Petru (Petra's Stone Collection) accounts for a modest stream of visitors during the tourist season. There are also galleries (Galler√≠ Sn√¶r√≥s and Svartholi√∞) and a handicrafts market in the salthouse (Salth√∫si√∞). At Galler√≠ Sn√¶r√≥s one can find a range of artwork, jewellery and textiles, including products from a local company that designs and manufactures a range of products made from recycled materials (MupiMup). The town's formerly disused 2800m2 fish factory is currently being transformed into the HERE Creative Centre, which houses workshops for ceramics, wood and metal, art studio spaces, and a recording studio. The centre also hosts live music events, exhibitions, and visiting artists, providing a cultural hub for the town. Accommodation is available at: Kirkjub√¶r, a former church converted into a guesthouse; at the caf√© / bar / bed & breakfast (Saxa Guesthouse, formerly Kaffi Steinn), at a campsite, and at the √ìseyri farmhouse (4 km west of the village). Several other holiday rentals are also available. There is also an internet caf√© / general store (Brekkan, formerly called Svarti Folinn), an outdoor swimming pool, self- service petrol station, ATM, bus stop and other services. ==Notable residents== Footballer √çvar Ingimarsson is the best known former inhabitant of the town. His footballing career started at local youth club S√∫lan, but he is best known for his spell at Reading in England where he played 281 games, 72 of which were in the Premier League. ==References== ==External links== * St√∂√∞varfj√∂r√∞ur page on Fjar√∞abygg√∞ municipal website Category:Populated places in Eastern Region (Iceland) Category:Fjords of Iceland ","title":"St√∂√∞varfj√∂r√∞ur"},{"id":"3255132","text":"Rushmore Hundred was a hundred in the county of Dorset, England, containing the parish of Winterborne Zelston ==See also== * List of hundreds in Dorset ==Sources== *Boswell, Edward, 1833: The Civil Division of the County of Dorset (published on CD by Archive CD Books Ltd, 1992) *Hutchins, John, History of Dorset, vols 1-4 (3rd ed 1861‚Äì70; reprinted by EP Publishing, Wakefield, 1973) *Mills, A.

Cell nuclei stained blue. Papanicolaou stain (also Papanicolaou's stain and Pap stain) is a multichromatic (multicolored) cytological staining technique developed by George Papanicolaou in 1942. The Papanicolaou stain is one of the most widely used stains in cytology, where it is used to aid pathologists in making a diagnosis. Although most notable for its use in the detection of cervical cancer in the Pap test or Pap smear, it is also used to stain non-gynecological specimen preparations from a variety of bodily secretions and from small needle biopsies of organs and tissues. Papanicolaou published three formulations of this stain in 1942, 1954, and 1960. == Usage == Pap staining is used to differentiate cells in smear preparations (in which samples are spread or smeared onto a glass microscope slide) from various bodily secretions and needle biopsies; the specimens may include gynecological smears (Pap smears), sputum, brushings, washings, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, abdominal fluid, pleural fluid, synovial fluid, seminal fluid, fine needle aspirations, tumor touch samples, or other materials containing loose cells. The pap stain is not fully standardized and comes in several formulations, differing in the exact dyes used, their ratios, and timing of the process. Pap staining is usually associated with cytopathology in which loose cells are examined, but the stain has also been modified and used on tissue slices. === Pap test === Pap staining is used in the Pap smear (or Pap test) and is a reliable technique in cervical cancer screening in gynecology. == Generalized staining method == The classic form of the Papanicolaou stain involves five stains in three solutions. * The first staining solution contains haematoxylin which stains cell nuclei. Papanicolaou used Harris's hematoxylin in all three formulations of the stain he published. * The second staining solution (designated OG-6), contains Orange G in 95% ethyl alcohol with a small amount of phosphotungstic acid. In the OG-6, the OG signifies Orange G and the '6' denotes the concentration of phosphotungstic acid added; other variants are OG-5 and OG-8). * The third staining solution is composed of three dyes, Eosin Y, Light Green SF yellowish, and Bismarck brown Y in 95% ethyl alcohol with a small amount of phosphotungstic acid and lithium carbonate. This solution, designated EA, followed by a number which denotes the proportion of the dyes, other formulations include EA-36, EA-50, and EA-65. The counterstains are dissolved in 95% ethyl alcohol which prevents cells from over staining which would obscure nuclear detail and cell outlines especially in the case when cells are overlapping on the slide. Phosphotungstic acid is added to adjust the PH of counterstains and helps to optimize the color intensity. The EA counterstain contains Bismarck brown and phosphotungstic acid, which when in combination, cause both to precipitate out of solution, reducing the useful life of the mixture. == Results == The stain should result in cells that are fairly transparent so even thicker specimens with overlapping cells can be interpreted. Cell nuclei should be crisp, blue to black on color and the chromatin patterns of the nucleus should be well defined. Cell cytoplasm stains blue-green and keratin stains orange in color. Eosin Y stains the superficial epithelial squamous cells, nucleoli, cilia, and red blood cells. Light Green SF yellowish stains the cytoplasm of other cells, other than superficial squamous cells. Superficial cells are orange to pink, and intermediate and parabasal cells are turquoise green to blue. ==Ultrafast Papanicolaou stain== Ultrafast Papanicolaou stain is an alternative for the fine needle aspiration samples, developed to achieve comparable visual clarity in significantly shorter time. The process differs in rehydration of the air- dried smear with saline, use 4% formaldehyde in 65% ethanol fixative, and use of Richard-Allan Hematoxylin-2 and Cyto-Stain, resulting in a 90-second process yielding transparent polychromatic stains. == Examples of Papanicolaou stain == == Papers by George N.

The work also questioned Spain's right to take the gold and silver acquired from the ransom paid to free Atahualpa, the Inca sovereign emperor, as well as valuables looted from the burial sites of the indigenous population. As a settler in the New World, he was appalled by the behaviour of the conquistadors towards the Native Americans. In De thesauris in Peru, which was dedicated to King Philip II of Spain, Las Casas wrote that when he had first reached the New World he had supported the atrocities, but had soon become sure that these acts would lead to the collapse of Spain itself in an act of Divine retribution. According to Las Casas, it was the duty of the Spanish to convert the Indians, who would then be loyal subjects of Spain, rather than to kill them. To remove the burden of slavery from them, Las Casas suggested that Africans should be brought to America instead, although he later decided against this when he saw how Africans were affected by slavery. ==See also== * Bartolom√© de las Casas * New Laws ==External links== * Bartolom√© de Las Casas and the Tradition of Medieval Law Category:Spanish colonization of the Americas Category:Spanish literature ","title":"De thesauris in Peru"},{"id":"3255144","text":"St George's Hundred, later often George Hundred, was a hundred (administrative division) in the county of Dorset, England, containing the following parishes: *Bradford Peverell *Broadmayne *Charminster *Frome Whitfield (absorbed by Dorchester Holy Trinity in 1610) *Stinsford *Stratton *Winterborne St Martin ==See also== * List of hundreds in Dorset ==Sources== *Boswell, Edward, 1833: The Civil Division of the County of Dorset (published on CD by Archive CD Books Ltd, 1992) *Hutchins, John, History of Dorset, vols 1-4 (3rd ed 1861‚Äì70; reprinted by EP Publishing, Wakefield, 1973) *Mills, A.

He was implicated in the 1920s Teapot Dome Scandal, and served six months in prison for jury tampering. Afterwards he returned to his former life and enjoyed its prosperity until his death. He was an avid owner of sports properties, one of the principal financial backers of baseball's Federal League and a force in U.S. thoroughbred racing. Horses from his stable won the Kentucky Derby and three Belmont Stakes. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Harry Sinclair was born in Benwood, West Virginia, now a suburb of the city of Wheeling. Sinclair grew up in Independence, Kansas. The son of a pharmacist, after finishing high school, he entered the pharmacy department of the University of Kansas, at Lawrence. He was working as a pharmacist in 1901 when the business failed. He then began selling lumber for derricks in the oil fields of southeastern Kansas. On the side, he started speculating in oil leases.Kansapedia. \\"Harry Ford Sinclair.\\" Kansas Historical Society. Retrieved November 14, 2011. The opportunity in the rapidly expanding oil industry saw him become a lease broker and acquire an interest in the White Oil Company. In 1904, Sinclair married Elizabeth Farrell of Independence, Kansas. By the time he was thirty, he had become a millionaire. ===Oil business=== In 1910, four businessmen: Eugene Frank Blaise, Charles J. Wrightsman, William Connelly, and Harry F. Sinclair bought the failed Farmers National Bank in Tulsa. They created a new entity, Exchange National Bank, and named Sinclair as President.\\"Historic Tulsa:The Bank at 320 South Boston\\" This bank, later renamed as the National Bank of Tulsa, was a forerunner of the present Bank of Oklahoma. On May 1, 1916, the highly successful Sinclair formed Sinclair Oil from the assets of eleven small petroleum companies. In the same year, he bought the Cudahy Refining Company of Chicago, owner of several oil pipelines and refineries.Weaver, Bobby D. \\"Sinclair Oil and Refining Corporation.\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Retrieved November 14, 2011. By the end of the 1920s, Sinclair Oil refineries had a production capacity of 80,000 barrels a day and had built almost of oil pipelines. Operations were expanded in various areas including a coal mining property. The company was ranked as the seventh largest oil company in the United States and the largest in the Midwest. Harry Sinclair's business acumen made him an important member of the local business community and he helped organize the State Bank of Commerce, which later was acquired by the First National Bank of Independence, of which Sinclair served on the board of directors. His brother, Earle W. Sinclair, served as president of Sinclair Refining Company until his death at age 70 of heart disease on September 21, 1944.United Press, ‚ÄúSinclair Refining Co.

D. (1978). The Great American Baseball Scrapbook, p. 54. Random House. . He was the principal owner of that league's Indianapolis franchise. Following the 1914 season, he purchased the remainder of the team and moved them to Newark, New Jersey, where they became the Newark Pepper.Hoosiers article at Everything2 After the season, the Federal League cut a deal with the other two baseball leagues. Sinclair reportedly made $2 million on his investment.Newark Pepper article at Everything2 Sinclair invested a substantial amount of money in thoroughbred race horses, acquiring the prestigious Rancocas Stable in Jobstown in southwest New Jersey from the estate of Pierre Lorillard IV. One of the most successful stables in the late 19th century, the farm continues to operate today as the Helis Stock Farm. The more than 2,000-acre (8.1 km2) farm includes a training barn with 1,100 windows enclosing a half-mile oblong indoor track. Sinclair again made it a major force in thoroughbred racing during the 1920s. Under trainer Sam Hildreth, Sinclair's stable won the Kentucky Derby and three Belmont Stakes. Such was the fame of Rancocas Stable that the Pennsylvania Railroad named baggage car #5858 in its honor. Two of the stable's colts, Grey Lag and Zev, are in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. == Scandal == Sinclair and his attorneys on the state at the Teapot Dome hearing Harry Sinclair's high-profile image as a reputable American business leader and sportsman came into question in April 1922 when The Wall Street Journal reported that United States Secretary of the Interior Albert B. Fall had granted an oil lease to Sinclair Oil without competitive bidding. The oil field lease was for government land in Wyoming that had been created as an emergency reserve for the United States Navy. What became known as the Teapot Dome scandal, ultimately led to a United States Senate establishing a Committee on Public Lands and Surveys to conduct hearings into the circumstances surrounding the government oil lease. The result was a finding of fraud and corruption which led to a number of civil lawsuits and criminal charges against Harry Sinclair and others. In 1927 the United States Supreme Court declared the Sinclair oil lease had been corruptly obtained and ordered it canceled. Two weeks after Harry Sinclair's trial began in October 1927, it abruptly ended when the judge declared a mistrial following evidence presented by the government prosecutors showing that Sinclair had hired a detective agency to shadow each member of the jury. Sinclair was charged with contempt of court, the case eventually winding up before the United States Supreme Court who, on June 3, 1929 upheld Sinclair's conviction. He was fined and sentenced to six and a half months in prison, which he served as prisoner #10,520, at the District of Columbia jail. While in prison, Sinclair was allowed to work as both pharmacist and physician's assistant, and it was while working within these capacities that he was allowed to be taken by car to attend to the prisoners assigned to work details at the city wharfs. Public attention and perceived favoritism prompted George S. Wilson, District Director of Public Welfare, to order an end to these rides, but rumors of Sinclair's preferential treatment continued. In 1929, Secretary Fall was found guilty of bribery, fined $100,000 and sentenced to one year in prison, making him the first Presidential cabinet member to go to prison for his actions in office. == Later life == At one time, Harry F. Sinclair owned this C. P. H. Gilbert designed mansion now known as the Harry F. Sinclair House, in New York City. After serving his short prison term Sinclair returned to his successful business. He had owned a luxurious French Renaissance-style ch√¢teauUkrainian Institute, originally the Isaac and Mary Fletcher House on the southeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 79th Street in New York City. His reputation destroyed there, Sinclair sold the property in 1930. Located in the same area as several major museums, it was eventually acquired by the Ukrainian Institute of America and is now open to the public. Harry Ford Sinclair retired as president of Sinclair Oil and Gas Company in January 1949. He died a wealthy man in Pasadena, California in 1956 and was interred in the Roman Catholic Calvary Cemetery, East Los Angeles. == Notes == == References == == External links == * Harry Ford Sinclair from the Kansas Historical Society Category:1876 births Category:1956 deaths Category:American businesspeople in the oil industry Category:American racehorse owners and breeders Category:People from Benwood, West Virginia Category:People from Independence, Kansas Category:American white-collar criminals Category:Federal League Category:Sinclair Oil Corporation Category:Teapot Dome scandal Category:Burials at Calvary Cemetery (Los Angeles) Category:Businesspeople from Tulsa, Oklahoma Category:People from Pasadena, California Category:American businesspeople convicted of crimes ","title":"Harry Ford Sinclair"},{"id":"3255152","text":"In Occupied Europe during World War II, a co-ordinated assassination offensive against Nazi security forces, codenamed Ratweek, was mounted in January 1944 by the Special Operations Executive (SOE), with the intention of creating confusion and trepidation at the same time as the Allies increased preparations for the Resistance's contribution to the Normandy Landings.

The measurements and markings of the track are of IAAF standards. The running track and jumping track use Conipur M full polyurethane synthetic material and are 13 mm and 20 mm thick respectively. Landing mattresses of 71 cm and 81 cm thick are provided for high jump and pole vault. Also, floodlighting of 450 lux is available. ==History== Wan Chai Sports Ground opened in 1979 on reclaimed land. It was originally managed by the Urban Council, and formed the Wan Chai Reclamation Recreation Centre Stage I (stage II being the adjacent swimming pool and indoor games hall). In 1996, the sports ground was used to help accommodate a queue of nearly 60,000 people seeking British Dependent Territories citizenship at Immigration Tower prior to the cut-off date of 30 March 1996 ahead of the handover. Part of the north end of the grandstand was demolished as part of the Sha Tin to Central Link project.

The conference, abbreviated as MC6, was held in Hong Kong from 13 to 18 December 2005. Officials expressed concerns that the protesters might destroy the sports ground, which could force a large number of schools to abandon their plans for sporting activities. However, the protest organiser, the Hong Kong People‚Äôs Alliance on WTO, was unhappy with a previous proposed location for demonstrations, Southorn Playground, which is blocked by highrises from the venue of the conference, the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. In the end, the number of protesters was smaller than expected and were sufficiently accommodated at the cargo handling basin. Hence, the sports ground was not used as a protest site. ==HKCEC Phase III== Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre Phase III will be developed on land now occupied by the Wan Chai pier bus terminus and Wan Chai Sports Ground.

Inspired by the work of Nicolas Bourbaki, they allegedly hoped to create a unified approach to evolutionary biology. However, the project was aborted and the name was reused in the 1980s for satirical purposes. Nabi's biography was listed in American Men and Women of Science, articles and letters were published in prominent journals under his name, and he was listed on the editorial board of Evolutionary Theory. He has primarily written on sociobiology. His article, \\"An Evolutionary Interpretation of the English Sonnet\\" was delivered as the First Annual Piltdown Lecture on Man and Nature and appeared under the heading \\"Advances in Sociobiopsy\\".

Nabi was supposedly born in 1910 in La Paz, Bolivia. After a precocious stay in medical school, he received an M.D. in 1936. He went on to attend grammar and secondary schools, finally receiving a Ph.D. at the Cochabamba University. For a period he resided in Buenos Aires, Argentina, as well as Caracas, Venezuela, where he headed the local affiliate of what was then called Esso Oil. He also was a practicing brain surgeon and editor of the revolutionary journal El Fomento. Despite his multi-tasking, he managed to publish a number of articles and addresses in population biology, evolution, and ecology. == Controversy == In 1981, Nabi had a letter published in Nature complaining that Richard Dawkins suggested both that we were \\"robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes ... they control us body and mind\\" and that we need to fight against the tendencies of our genes. Similarly, E. O. Wilson has said that neurobiology provided \\"a genetically accurate and hence completely fair code of ethics\\" but also warned against the naturalistic fallacy. Wilson complained to Nature magazine that Nabi was an invented character and insisted that he \\"lifted the two 1975 phrases of mine out of context in a way that reverses the meaning of one\\". The editors suggested that Nabi was a pseudonym of Lewontin's. Lewontin wrote to insist he was not \\"Isidore Nabi\\", citing Nabi's biography in American Men and Women of Science and editorial board position on Evolutionary Theory. Isidore Nabi replied to insist that he was not Isadore Nabi, the author of the letter. This all led to a Nature editorial in the fall of 1981 which stated that Nabi was the pen name of Richard Lewontin, Leigh van Valen, and Richard Lester and decrying its use as deceptive. Richard Lester wrote an outraged reply insisting that he had not been involved at all and suggesting Nature was irresponsible in not checking with him first. The editors suggested that Richard Lester was a pseudonym of Richard Levins. ==References== Category:Hoaxes in science Category:Academic shared pseudonyms Category:Fictional academics Category:Fictional Czech people Category:Fictional Bolivian people ","title":"Isadore Nabi"},{"id":"3255183","text":"Brave Murder Day is Katatonia's second full-length album, released in 1996 by Avantgarde Music.

After some shuffling of commands, these two squadrons were placed under the provisional 801st Bomb Group at RAF Harrington at the beginning of 1944 and the first \\"Carpetbagger\\" missions were carried out by this unit under the control of General \\"Wild Bill\\" Donovan's Office of Strategic Services (OSS). In April 1944, the group moved to RAF Harrington (Station 179), a more secluded and thus more secure airbase. A month later, in advance of the expected invasion of Europe, it was expanded to four squadrons to increase its capabilities and to pick up workload from RAF Bomber Command; the two new squadrons were the 788th and 850th Bombardment Squadrons. The Group had already adopted the nickname of \\"Carpetbaggers\\" from its original operational codename. In August 1944, the group dropped the \\"Provisional\\" status and absorbed the names of the 492d Bombardment Group from RAF North Pickenham, which had stood down after severe losses in its initial operations but stayed at Harrington; its squadrons became the 856th, 857th, 858th and 859th Bomb Squadrons. From January 1944 to the end of the war, the Group, in liaison with the British Special Operations Executive and later the Special Forces Headquarters (SFHQ) in London, dropped spies and supplies to the resistance forces of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway. During a hiatus in operations from mid-September 1944 to the end of 1944, the Group ferried gasoline to depots on the Continent for two weeks to supply advancing Allied armies, then three squadrons went into training for night bombing operations, whilst the 856th participated in the return of Allied airmen on the Continent who had either evaded capture or had walked out of Switzerland after that country relaxed its internment practices. This exercise was carried out mostly in Douglas C-47 Skytrains assigned to the group originally for insertion operations during the previous summer. In December 1944, the 859th was sent on Detached Service with the Fifteenth Air Force in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations with the 2641st Special Group (Provisional) at Brindisi, Italy. The 856th Bomb Squadron, after completing the personnel recovery mission, resumed Carpetbagger operations on a limited basis during the bad weather of the winter of 1945, while the remaining two squadrons (the 857th and 858th) participated in medium altitude bombing from late December 1944 through March 1945. In the spring of 1945, Carpetbagger operations resumed but not to the extent of the previous year. The 857th was detached and sent to RAF Bassingbourn (91st Bomb Group) at the end of March 1945, while the 856th and 858th dropped small numbers of agents and sabotage teams into the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway and Germany. Operations came to an end at Harrington at the end of April 1945, though a few special OSS missions, such as returning dignitaries to formerly occupied countries, carried on until the Group disbanded and returned to the United States in early July 1945. ==Operations== The B-24 Liberator bombers used for the flights were modified by removing the belly turret, nose guns and any equipment unnecessary for the mission, such as oxygen equipment, in order to lighten them and provide more cargo space and speed. The rear guns were kept as protection from night fighters. Agents and crated supplies were dropped by parachute through the opening left by removal of the belly turret. In addition, supplies were loaded into containers designed to fit inside the bomb-bay and released from there by the existing equipment. Targets were given by exact longitudes and latitudes, thus making precise navigation imperative. All flights were made on moonlit nights so that visual navigation could be made by using rivers, lakes, railroad tracks, and towns as check points. The pilot, copilot, and bombardier all had maps to aid them in keeping track of their location, whilst the navigator kept position by dead reckoning, with all four of these officers staying in close interphone contact. All flights were individual, each navigator choosing his route in consultation with the pilot. On flights to French targets the aircraft crossed the coast at around six thousand feet to avoid light anti-aircraft fire, dropping to five hundred feet or so to avoid night fighters once inland and to make it possible to verify location, assuring that checkpoints on the ground corresponded exactly to the area being looked at in the cockpit and nose of the aircraft. Limited visibility at higher altitude would make this more difficult if not impossible. Since drops were made at at the pilot's discretion, being already at such a height made the drops more efficient. When only a few miles from the target area all available eyes began searching for the drop area, which would usually be identified by three high powered flashlights placed in a row, with a fourth at a 90 degree angle to indicate the direction of the drop. Coming towards the target, the aircraft slowed to between and dropped to an altitude of , higher in hilly country: agents were dropped first, with supplies on a second drop. Often, pilots had to fly several miles farther into enemy territory after completing their drops to disguise the actual drop location should any enemy observers recognize the aircraft's turning point as the drop location. In some cases multiple drops in isolated areas were made at different intervals and bonfires would be used as drop indicators instead of flashlights. In rare cases air to ground oral radio contact would be made, these being of great importance. ==After the war== The group has been generally recognized as the ancestor of today's Air Force Special Operations. ==External links== * The Harrington Museum * Operation Carpetbagger Fact Sheet - U.S. Air Force Museum Category:World War II aerial operations and battles of the Western European Theatre Category:World War II operations and battles of the Italian Campaign Category:World War II resistance movements ","title":"Operation Carpetbagger"},{"id":"3255190","text":"Sturminster Newton Hundred or Sturminster Newton Castle Hundred was a hundred in the county of Dorset, England, containing the following parishes: *Hinton St Mary *Margaret Marsh *Marnhull *Okeford Fitzpaine *Sturminster Newton ==See also== *List of hundreds in Dorset ==Sources== *Boswell, Edward, 1833: The Civil Division of the County of Dorset (published on CD by Archive CD Books Ltd, 1992) *Hutchins, John, History of Dorset, vols 1-4 (3rd ed 1861‚Äì70; reprinted by EP Publishing, Wakefield, 1973) *Mills, A.

Tarantini was part of the Argentina under-23 team that won the 1975 Toulon Tournament, together with Jorge Valdano, Am√©rico Gallego, and others, with C√©sar Menotti as coach. He became the left-back of the Argentina national football team after Jorge Carrascosa left the team (the book El DT del Proceso by Gasparini and Ponsico El DT del Proceso claims that the wolf Carrascosa declined to play for the dictatorship). He was also, at 22, the youngest player of that team. A few months before the 1978 FIFA World Cup, he had a contractual dispute with Boca that left him clubless, as Boca management pressured all Argentine clubs into denying him a new contract.

Bowdon, Hale and Hale Barns together are regarded as the wealthiest areas in Greater Manchester, and similarly wealthy to Cheshire Golden Triangle towns Wilmslow, Alderley Edge and Prestbury. These towns and the area between them contain some of the most expensive properties in England outside London. ==History== Both Bowdon and Dunham Massey are mentioned in the Domesday Book, citing the existence of a church and a mill in Bowdon, and Dunham Massey is identified as Doneham: Hamo de Mascy. The name Bowdon came from Anglo-Saxon Boga-d≈´n = \\"bow (weapon)-hill\\" or \\"curved hill\\". Both areas came under Hamo de Masci in Norman times. His base was a wooden castle at Dunham. Watch Hill Castle was built on the border between Bowdon and Dunham Massey between the Norman Conquest and the 13th century. The timber castle most likely belonged to Hamo de Mascy; the castle had fallen out of use by the 13th century.Watch Hill Castle by Norman Redhead in The last Hamo de Masci died in 1342. The Black Death came to the area in 1348. Before 1494 the ruins of the castle at Dunham were acquired by Sir Robert Booth. In 1750, this and the other Booth estates passed to the Earl of Stamford by his marriage to Lady Mary Booth. The 10th and last Earl of Stamford died in 1976, who bequeathed Dunham Massey and his Carrington estates to the National Trust. The development of Bowdon as a residential area began apace in the 1840s, when the landowners of the area sold off parcels of land. The opening of Bowdon railway station in 1849 provided a commuter route to the centre of Manchester, making the clean air and tranquility of the Bowdon Downs more attractive to developers. Initially, terraces and semi-detached houses were built, but by the 1860s and 1870s, the 'merchant princes' had built the large houses on Green Walk which are still a defining feature of the ward.A history of Bowdon in the 19th Century, from Bowdon Bowling and Lawn Tennis Club. By 1878 Kelly's Directory was describing Bowdon as \\"studded with handsome villas and mansions\\", and around 60% of the residents were business owners.

Bowdon has formed part of two Poor Law Unions: Altrincham (1837 to 1895); Bucklow (1895 to 1930). ===Political representation=== Bowdon was in the parliamentary constituency of Altrincham from 1885 until 1945; in Bucklow from 1945 until 1950; in Knutsford from 1950 until 1983; and in Altrincham and Sale from 1983 until 1997. Bowdon has been part of the parliamentary constituency of Altrincham and Sale West since 1997. Since its formation this constituency has been represented in the House of Commons by the Conservative MP, Graham Brady. This is one of only a small number of seats in the North West held by the Conservative Party, and one of only two in Greater Manchester. Bowdon is in Trafford Metropolitan Borough; Trafford Council is responsible for the administration of local services, such as education, social services, town planning, waste collection and council housing. Bowdon is covered by the Bowdon electoral ward; this ward has 3 out of the 63 seats on the Trafford Council; as of the 2012 local elections all three seats were held by the Conservative Party. The councillors for the Bowdon ward are Sean Anstee, Karen Barclay, and Michael Hyman, all members of the Conservative Party. ==Geography== Bowdon is located at the southwest edge of Greater Manchester. It is situated on a ridge which rises above the Cheshire Plain. Bowdon is the largest ward in the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, and comprises several small, rural villages surrounded by open countryside, including Dunham Massey Country Park and other more densely populated residential areas. It has been described as an affluent and attractive place to live.Bowdon Ward Profile , Trafford Council Working Document, 2006. Retrieved 19 February 2007. The majority of the ward is owned by the National Trust as part of the Dunham Massey Estate, which serves as a significant communal asset for the residents of the local and wider areas. The estate includes Dunham Massey Hall and a deer park. Bowdon is a semi-rural ward and has a low population density. ===Divisions and suburbs=== There are four distinct neighbourhoods of Bowdon: * Dunham Massey * Warburton * Bowdon * Bowdon Vale ==Demography== According to a Trafford Metropolitan Council report, the population of Bowdon in 2001 was 8,806. 1730 were under 16 and 1699 were 65 and over. In 2004, the majority of residents (8,343) described themselves as white. Out of 8414 wards of the United Kingdom, Bowdon ranks as 8,235th in terms of deprivation indicating that only 2.2% of UK wards suffer less deprivation In 1931, 27.6% of Bowdon's population was middle class compared with 14% in England and Wales, and by 1971, this had increased to 58.9% compared with 24% nationally. Parallel to this doubling of the middle classes in Bowdon was the decline of the working class population. In 1931, 16.1% were working class compared with 36% in England and Wales; by 1971, this had decreased to 14.7% in Bowdon and 26% nationwide. The rest of the population was made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers or other miscellaneous.

It results in unusually thick convolutions of the cerebral cortex. Typically, children have developmental delay and seizures, the onset and severity depending on the severity of the cortical malformation. Infantile spasms are common in affected children, as is intractable epilepsy. == Presentation == The term 'pachygyria' does not directly relate to a specific malformation but rather is used to generally describe physical characteristics of the brain in association with several neuronal migration disorders; most commonly disorders relating to varied degrees of lissencephaly. Lissencephaly is present in 1 of 85,470 births and the life span of those affected is short as only a few survive past the age of 20. Pachygyria is a condition identified by a type of cortical genetic malformation. Clinicians will subjectively determine the malformation based on the degree of malposition and the extent of thickened abnormal grey differentiation present. === Connections to epilepsy, lissencephaly, and subcortical band heterotopia === Various degrees of intensity and locations of epilepsy are associated with malformations of cortical development. Researchers suggest that approximately 40% of children diagnosed with drug- resistant epilepsy have some degree of cortical malformation. Lissencephaly (to which pachygyria is most closely linked) is associated with severe mental retardation, epilepsy, and motor disability. Two characteristics of lissencephaly include its absence of convolutions (agyria) and decreased presence of convolutions (pachygyria). The types of seizures associated with lissencephaly include: *persisting spasms *focal seizures *tonic seizures *atypical seizures *atonic seizures Other possible symptoms of lissencephaly include telecanthus, estropia, hypertelorism, varying levels of mental retardation, cerebellar hypoplasia, corpus callosum aplasia, and decreased muscle tone and tendon reflexes. Over 90% of children affected with lissencephaly have seizures. Patients with subcortical band heterotopia (another disorder associated with pachygyria) typically have milder symptoms and their cognitive function is closely linked to the thickness of the subcortical band and the degree of pachygyria present. == Causes == Pachygyria is caused by a breakdown in the fetal neuronal migration process due to genetic or possibly environmental influences. The affected cerebral cortex will typically have only four developed layers instead of the normal six. One of the best known and most common types of neuronal migration disorders is lissencephaly, a diffuse cortical malformation relating directly to agyria and pachygyria. Incomplete neuronal migration during the early fetal brain development is the precursor to lissencephaly. Should neurons follow an abnormal migration during development possible cortical malformations include classical lissencephaly (as stated above) and subcortical band heterotopia with an agyria-pachygyria band spectrum. === Normal neuronal migration === Normal neuronal migration involves the development of six cortical layers, each one performing distinct functions. Normal cerebral development occurs in three dynamic and overlapping stages: *first stage: stem cells proliferate and differentiate into neurons or glial cells within the forebrain and the ventricular and subventricular zones lining the cerebral cavity; *in humans this stage lasts from gestational weeks 5-6 to 16-20; *second stage: migration away from the origin in a radial fashion along the glial fibers from the periventricular region of the ganglionic eminences towards the pial surface; **the generations settle into a pattern within the cortical plate during this stage; **in humans this stage lasts from gestational weeks 6-7 to 20-24; *third stage: apoptosis and synaptogenesis within the six cortical layers to develop correct cortical organization; **in humans this stage lasts from gestational week 16 until long after birth. Most types of incomplete neuronal migration to the cortex occur during the third and fourth gestational months. The abnormal migration of the neurons causes them to not reach their proper final destinations, which results in failure of the sulci and gyri to form. The stage of cortical development at which migration is arrested is directly related to the level of structural malposition. One of the most critical stages in brain development is when the post-mitotic neurons migrate from the ventricular zone to form the cortical plate. Migration arrested toward the latter part of development usually restricts the abnormal cell position to the cortex level. === Neuronal migration disorder caused by genetic mutations === Several genetic mutations have been isolated and linked to specific malformations of the cerebral cortex. Genes shown to cause lissencephaly include both autosomal and X-linked genes. Below, the mutations of LIS1 or DCX genes are discussed as they are most commonly linked to neuronal migration disorders including lissencephaly-pachygyria and subcortical band heterotopia. === LIS1 === LIS1 is responsible for the autosomal form of lissencephaly. Mutations of the LIS1 gene are associated with about 80% of those affected with lissencephaly. LIS1 was the first human neuronal migration gene to be cloned. It is responsible for encoding the alpha subunit of the intracellular Ib isoform of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase. It is located on chromosome 17p13.3 and has 11 exons with a coding region of 1233bp. LIS1 protein appears to interact with tubulin to suppress microtubule dynamics. The protein is highly conserved and studies have shown that it participates in cytoplasmic dynein-mediated nucleokinesis, somal translocation, cell motility, mitosis, and chromosome segregation. LIS1 encodes for a 45kDa protein called PAFAH1B1 that contains seven WD40 repeats required for proper neuronal migration. The LIS1 gene encodes for a protein similar to the Œ≤ subunit of G proteins responsible for degrading bioactive lipid platelet-activating factor (PAF). This leads to theories that LIS1 might exert its effect on migration through microtubules. Specific concentrations of PAF may be necessary for optimal neuronal migration by influencing cell morphology adhesion properties. Studies have shown that addition of PAF or inhibition of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) decreases cerebellar granule cell migration in vitro. Addition of PAF to hippocampal cells have shown growth cone collapse and neurite retraction. LIS1 knockout homozygous null mice die during embryogenesis and heterozygous mice survive with delayed neuronal migration confirmed by in vitro and in vivo cell migration assays. Most lissencephaly cases are associated with deletions of mutations of the LIS1 gene and the results are usually more severe in the posterior brain regions. One study showed that of an isolated group of patients with lissencephaly, 40% resulted from an LIS1 deletion and another 25% resulted from an intragenic mutation of the gene. Patients with missense mutations tend to have less severe symptoms, pachygyria, and rare cases of subcortical band heterotopia. Truncated (shortened) mutations of LIS1 tend to cause severe lissencephaly. === Doublecortin === Doublecortin (DCX or XLIS) mutations are responsible for X-linked disorders. While LIS1 mutations tend to cause severe malformations in the posterior brain, DCX mutations focus much of their destruction on anterior malformations and are linked to lissencephaly in males and subcortical band heterotopias in females. Women with DCX mutations tend to have an anteriorly- predominant subcortical band heterotopia and pachygyria. DCX was the first known gene causing X-linked lissencephaly and subcortical band heterotopia. It is found on chromosome Xq22.3-q23 and has nine exons that code for 360 proteins. DCX is expressed exclusively in the fetal brain. Spastic For details on the most common form of cerebral palsy, see spastic diplegia. Spastic cerebral palsy is by far the most common type, occurring in 70% to 80% of all cases. Moreover, spastic CP accompanies one of the other types in 30% of all cases. People with this type are hypertonic and have a neuromuscular condition stemming from damage to the corticospinal tract or the motor cortex that affects the nervous system's ability to receive gamma amino butyric acid in the area(s) affected by the disability. Spastic CP is further classified by topography dependent on the region of the body affected; these include: Spastic hemiplegia (one side being affected). Generally, injury to muscle- nerves controlled by the brain's left side will cause a right body deficit, and vice versa. Typically, people that have spastic hemiplegia are the most ambulatory, although they generally have dynamic equinus on the affected side and are primarily prescribed ankle-foot orthoses to prevent said equinus.[11] Spastic diplegia (the lower extremities are affected with little to no upper- body spasticity). The most common form of the spastic forms. Most people with spastic diplegia are fully ambulatory and have a scissors gait. Flexed knees and hips to varying degrees are common. Hip problems, dislocations, and in three-quarters of spastic diplegics, also strabismus (crossed eyes), can be present as well. In addition, these individuals are often nearsighted. The intelligence of a person with spastic diplegia is unaffected by the condition. Spastic tetraplegia (all four limbs affected equally). People with spastic quadriplegia are the least likely to be able to walk, or if they can, to want to walk, because their muscles are too tight and it is too much effort to do so. Some children with quadriplegia also have hemiparetic tremors, an uncontrollable shaking that affects the limbs on one side of the body and impairs normal movement. Occasionally, terms such as monoplegia, paraplegia, triplegia, and pentaplegia may also be used to refer to specific manifestations of the spasticity. ==Pathogenesis== Pachygyria, lissencephaly (smooth brain), and polymicrogyria (multiple small gyri) are all the results of abnormal cell migration. The abnormal migration is typically associated with a disorganized cellular architecture, failure to form six layers of cortical neurons (a four-layer cortex is common), and functional problems. The abnormal formation of the brain may be associated with seizures, developmental delay, and mental dysfunctions. Normally, the brain cells begin to develop in the periventricular region (germinal matrix) and then migrate from medial to lateral, to form the cerebral cortex. == Diagnosis == Different imaging modalities are commonly used for diagnosis. While computed tomography (CT) provides higher spatial resolution imaging of the brain, cerebral cortex malformations are more easily visualized in vivo and classified using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which provides higher contrast imaging and better delineation of white and gray matter. Diffuse pachygyria (a mild form of lissencephaly) can be seen on an MRI as thickened cerebral cortices with few and large gyri and incomplete development of the Sylvian fissures.Phadke, S., \\"et al.\\" (2007). \\"Pachygyria in a Girl with Microcephalic Osteodysplastic Primordial Short Stature Type II.\\" Brain and Development. 27:237-240. *severe epilepsy *reduced longevity *varying degrees of mental retardation *intractable epilepsy *spasticity Cognitive ability correlates with the thickness of any subcortical band present and the degree of pachygyria. === Classifications === The degree of cerebral cortex malformation caused by genetic mutations is classified by the degree of malposition and the extent of faulty grey matter differentiation. Neuronal migration disorders are generally classified into three groups: *lissencephaly/subcortical band heterotopia *cobblestone *‚Äòother‚Äô heterotopias The ‚Äòother‚Äô types are associated with corpus callosum agenesis or cerebellar hypoplasia while the cobblestone lissencephalies are associated with eye and muscle disorders. Classical lissencephaly, also known as type I or generalized agyria-pachygyria, is a severe brain malformation of a smooth cerebral surface, abnormally thick (10-20mm) cortex with four layers, widespread neuronal heterotopia, enlarged ventricles, and agenesis or malformation of the corpus callosum. Classical lissencephaly can range from agyria to regional pachygyria and is usually present along with subcortical band heterotopia (known as ‚Äòdouble cortex‚Äô to describe the circumferential bands of heterotopic neurons located beneath the cortex). Subcortical band heterotopia is a malformation slightly different from lissencephaly that is now classified under the agyria-pachygyria-band spectrum because it consists of a gyral pattern consistent with broad convolutions and an increased cortical thickness. The established classification scheme for lissencephaly is based on the severity (grades 1-6) and the gradient. *Grade 1: generalized agyria *Grade 2: variable degree of agyria *Grade 3: variable degree of pachygyria *Grade 4: generalized pachygyria *Grade 5: mixed pachygyria and subcortical band heterotopia *Grade 6: subcortical band heterotopia alone *Gradient ‚Äòa‚Äô: from posterior to anterior gradient *Gradient ‚Äòb‚Äô: from anterior to posterior gradient Grade 1 and Grade 4 are very rare. Grade 2 is observed in children with Miller‚ÄìDieker syndrome (a combination of lissencephaly with dysmorphic facial features, visceral abnormalities, and polydactyly). The most common lissencephaly observed, consisting of frontotemporal pachygyria and posterior agyria, is Grade 3. Another malformation worth mentioning because of its connections to pachygyria is polymicrogyria. Polymicrogyria is characterized by many small gyri separated by shallow sulci, slightly thin cortex, neuronal heterotopia and enlarged ventricle and is often superimposed on pachygyria. == Treatment == Because pachygyria is a structural defect no treatments are currently available other than symptomatic treatments, especially for associated seizures. Another common treatment is a gastrostomy (insertion of a feeding tube) to reduce possible poor nutrition and repeated aspiration pneumonia. == Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism== Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism (MOPD) type II is an autosomal multisystem disorder including severe pre- and post-natal growth retardation, microcephaly with Seckel syndrome-like facial appearance, and distinctive skeletal alterations. Usually those affected have mild to moderate mental retardation. This female child is the first born of nonconsanguineous parents at 35 weeks gestation through a cesarean section due to intrauterine growth retardation. She had a retarded psychomotor development and was repeatedly hospitalized during her first six months of life due to recurring respiratory infections. Her electroencephalography, auditory brainstem response evaluation, and chromosomal analysis were relatively normal. A brain MRI revealed thickened cerebral cortices with few and large gyri prominently in the frontal and posterior temporal regions, incomplete development of the Sylvian fissures, and dilatation of the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles (colpocephaly). Usually only mild brain malformations are associated with MOPD type II. The imaging findings of this child‚Äôs brain most likely represent diffuse pachygyria, a mild form of lissencephaly. This child‚Äôs neurodevelopmental findings were mild when compared to previous reports of a well-defined chromosome 17-linked and X-linked lissencephaly in a bedridden patient with severe developmental delays. ==See also== * Lissencephaly * Polymicrogyria ==References== Should ref 4 Phadke be the following, rather than having ref 10 Ozawa's data? * == External links == * Category:Congenital disorders of nervous system Category:Neuronal migration disorders ","title":"Pachygyria"},{"id":"3255229","text":"Tollerford Hundred was a hundred in the county of Dorset, England, containing the following parishes: *Chilfrome *East Chelborough *Evershot *Frome St Quintin *Frome Vauchurch *Maiden Newton *Melbury Sampford *Rampisham *Toller Fratrum *Toller Porcorum (part) *West Chelborough *Wynford Eagle ==See also== *List of hundreds in Dorset ==Sources== *Boswell, Edward, 1833: The Civil Division of the County of Dorset (published on CD by Archive CD Books Ltd, 1992) *Hutchins, John, History of Dorset, vols 1-4 (3rd ed 1861‚Äì70; reprinted by EP Publishing, Wakefield, 1973) *Mills, A.

The station is in an unusual location straddling a curved section of track. As a result, the track bed is cambered so that trains come to rest at the station platform at a significant tilt. In recent years enforcement action was taken by the Environment Agency when fuel oil spilled from the over-filled tanks of a diesel engine and percolated through the track bed and flowed onto the nearby beach, polluting it. The current station consists of the platform faces that served the former fast lines (the section from here to Llandudno Junction was quadruple track until the 1960s). The platform faces to the slow lines were taken out of service and that on the \\"down\\" (westbound) side has been obliterated as a result of the construction of the A55 Images of diversion of North Wales Coast Railway at Colwyn Bay to accommodate A55 dual carriageway (along with the old station goods yard).

He left Sinclair Research in 1984 in protest at the premature launch of the QL, and formed QJUMP Ltd., a software house specializing in system software and utilities for the QL, based in Rampton, Cambridgeshire, England. Prior to this he worked at the Philips Research Laboratories in Redhill, Surrey where he worked on realtime image processing, using electronic hardware rather than software. At that time, software would have been either a batch program on the PRL mainframe computer or, within the departmental laboratory, the Commodore PET. Among the software developed by QJUMP was SuperToolkit II, a collection of extensions to Qdos and SuperBASIC; a Qdos floppy disk driver which became the de facto standard for the various third-party floppy disk interfaces sold for the QL; and the QJUMP Pointer Environment, which extended the primitive display windowing facility of Qdos into something approaching a full GUI. Tebby also received a commission to write a Qdos-like operating system for the Atari ST; this was called SMS2. Tebby later moved to Le Grand-Pressigny, France, but continued his involvement in the QL user community. In the early 1990s, he developed SMSQ, a new Qdos-compatible OS, based on SMS2, for the Miracle Systems QXL, a QL emulator card for PCs. An enhanced version of SMSQ was ported to the Atari ST and various other QL emulators, being renamed SMSQ/E. He has also worked on Stella, an embedded operating system for 68000-series and ColdFire processors. == References == Category:Computer programmers Category:Sinclair Research Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Tony Tebby"},{"id":"3255275","text":"Tell Me a Story may refer to: ==Music== * \\"Tell Me a Story\\" (1927 song), 1990 * \\"Tell Me a Story (About the Night Before)\\", a song by Hilary Duff * \\"Tell Me a Story\\" (Terry Gilkyson song), 1953, written by Terry Gilkyson and recorded by Jimmy Boyd & Frankie Laine * \\"Tell Me a Story\\", a song by Iggy Pop from New Values ==Literature== * Tell Me a Story (book), a children's book by Mary Louisa Molesworth * Tell Me a Story: Fifty Years and 60 Minutes in Television, a book by Don Hewitt * Tell Me a Story: A New Look at Real and Artificial Memory, a book by Roger Schank * \\"Tell Me a Story\\", a newspaper column carried by Universal Press Syndicate ==Television== * Tell Me a Story (TV series), CBS All Access series ","title":"Tell Me a Story"},{"id":"3255276","text":"Whiteway Hundred was a hundred in the English county of Dorset, containing the following parishes: *Cheselbourne *Hilton *Ibberton *Melcombe Horsey *Milton Abbas *Stoke Wake *Woolland ==See also== *List of hundreds in Dorset ==Sources== *Boswell, Edward, 1833: The Civil Division of the County of Dorset (published on CD by Archive CD Books Ltd, 1992) *Hutchins, John, History of Dorset, vols 1-4 (3rd ed 1861‚Äì70; reprinted by EP Publishing, Wakefield, 1973) *Mills, A.

It is designed to cover every economic sector and virtually every activity of the humankind where technical standards may be used. Developed and maintained by the International Organization for Standardization, the ICS is intended to be a continuous work in progress and is updated when necessary. The latest edition of the ICS can be downloaded free of charge from the ISO web site. Anyone may submit a proposal for modifications or additions to the ICS. == Purpose == The ICS serves as a structure for catalogues and databases of technical standards and other normative documents, and as a basis for standing-order systems for international, regional and national standards. == Classification principles == The ICS uses an hierarchical classification, which consists of three nested levels called fields (Level 1), groups (Level 2) and sub-groups (Level 3). Each field is subdivided into groups, which are further divided into sub- groups. All classification levels are designated by a classification code (called notation) and a title. The notation is a set of Arabic numerals. Top- level items, which have no parent levels, use a two-digit notation, for example: :\`43 ROAD VEHICLE ENGINEERING\` The notations for groups and sub- groups include the parent-level notations. The example below shows a notation for Sub-Group 20 (Level 3), which belongs to Group 040 (Level 2) in Field 43 (Level 1). :\`43.040.20 Lighting, signaling and warning devices\` === Level 1 (Fields) === A field is the first level in the International Classification for Standards. It may represent one or a combination of the following: *A sector of the economy such as agriculture, mining, construction or the packaging industry; *A technology such as telecommunications or food processing; *An activity such as environment protection, safety assurance and protection of public health; *A field of science such as mathematics or astronomy. At present the classification includes 40 fields: :01 Generalities, terminology, standardization, documentation :03 Services, company organization, management and quality, administration, transport, sociology :07 Mathematics, natural sciences :11 Health care technology :13 Environment, health protection, safety :17 Metrology and measurement, physical phenomena :19 Testing :21 Mechanical systems and components for general use :23 Fluid systems and components for general use :25 Manufacturing engineering :27 Energy and heat transfer engineering :29 Electrical engineering :31 Electronics :33 Telecommunications, audio and video engineering :35 Information technology, office machines :37 Image technology :39 Precision mechanics, jewelry :43 Road vehicles engineering :45 Railway engineering :47 Shipbuilding and marine structures :49 Aircraft and space vehicle engineering :53 Materials handling equipment :55 Packaging and distribution of goods :59 Textile and leather technology :61 Clothing industry :65 Agriculture :67 Food technology :71 Chemical technology :73 Mining and minerals :75 Petroleum, and related technologies :77 Metallurgy :79 Wood technology :81 Glass and ceramics industries :83 Rubber and plastics industries :85 Paper technology :87 Paint and colour industries :91 Construction materials and building :93 Civil engineering :95 Military engineering :97 Domestic and commercial equipment, entertainment, sports. ===Level 2 (Groups) === The ICS second level, the group, is a subdivision of the field. === Level 3 (Sub-Groups) === Sub-groups are used in the ICS to subdivide groups into subjects that certain to a particular aspect of the subject covered by a given group. Regardless of the subject, virtually all groups include a sub-group No. 01 that covers the complete subject of the respective group. In addition, most of the groups contain a sub-group No. 99 for standards on subjects which do not correspond either to the subjects of the general sub-groups or to the subjects of the specific sub-groups of the respective groups. === Level 4 (Units) === Level 4 subdivisions are not part of the official ICS document. The ICS rules however allow users of the classification system to subdivide the official ICS sub- groups into so-called units, making them a Level 4 component of the International Classification for Standards. This is accomplished by adding a two-digit number to the notation of the sub-group being subdivided. However, instead of a period, new notations use a hyphen as a separator. For example: :\`35.220.20-10 Magnetic tapes\` == Statistics == *The International Classification for Standards has 99 top-level divisions of which only 40 are presently used. The remaining 59 divisions are reserved for topics that are not yet known. *There are three \\"official\\" levels in the ICS system, each holding ninety nine (99), nine hundred and ninety nine (999) and ninety nine (99) subsets, respectively. *Each field of the ICS is designed to hold a maximum of 999 groups. *Although any group in the ICS may contain no more than 99 \\"official\\" sub-groups, the holding capacity of the group can be expanded 99 times by using \\"unofficial\\" Level 4 subdivisions, an option that is built into the ICS. Adding Level 4 subdivisions to all sub-groups within a group increases the group's holding capacity to 9 801 subjects. *The expanded version of the International Classification for Standards is capable of covering nearly 1 billion subjects (969,328,701 to be exact). This can be achieved without any restructuring of its numerical coding system. Since there are currently about 780 000 national standards in the world, the number of subjects that the ICS can offer for classification purposes exceeds 1 200 times the total number of documents that are available for classification. == References == * * ==External links== *Full text of the ICS in PDF format (ISO web site) Category:Trade and industrial classification systems Category:Standards ","title":"International Classification for Standards"},{"id":"3255294","text":"Little Oxendon is a deserted medieval village about one mile north of Great Oxendon (where any population is included) at . A number of primary sources for some of the details that appear below are quoted by John Bridges in his history of Northamptonshire. ==History== Little Oxendon, despite its name, was historically situated in the parish of Little Bowden and not transferred to Great Oxendon until the 19th century. A chapel at Little Oxendon itself was evidently built around 1398, as in that year the building was in existence but had not yet been consecrated. The chapel appears still to have been in use when Robert Palmer made his will on 10 April 1525. In about 1467, Hugh Boyvile of Ridlington gave up the manor of Little Oxendon to his son Richard Boyville and his heirs, with remainder to William his brother and his heirs. In 1510, Richard Boyvile of Burton Latimer bequeathed his estate to his wife Gresyll for her life, after which it was to go to his son George Boyvile. A series of transactions during the early 16th century transferred the manor in sequence from George Boyvile to Andrew Palmer; his son Robert Palmer; Sir Thomas Griffin and lastly to Edward Griffin of Dingley who died about 1570. An account of the history of Little Oxendon and an intricate plan of the extent of the surviving earthworks appear on the relevant page of British History Online. That source concludes ‚Äúit appears that the village was deliberately cleared for sheep farming in the 14th century‚Äù. However Little Oxendon still had at least eight inhabitants in 1405 and evidence of the total population during the 15th century is lacking, so the period suggested for depopulation may well be too early. When Bridges researched the history of Northamptonshire during the five years prior to his death in 1724, only one house remained at Little Oxendon, though there was evidence of the site of the chapel and of several former houses as square building stones and burnt hearth stones had been dug up at different times. ==Information available== Information about how to visit the site of Little Oxendon and the extensive well preserved ridge and furrow fields in the vicinity is set out on the Natural England website. This includes an opportunity to download a large scale map showing the relevant public and permissive footpaths and the precise location of the site of the village. The extent and pattern of the surviving earthworks can be best appreciated by consulting aerial views which can also be seen online. ==References== Category:Deserted medieval villages in Northamptonshire ","title":"Little Oxendon"},{"id":"3255299","text":"Winfrith Hundred was a hundred in the county of Dorset, England, containing the following parishes: *Coombe Keynes *East Lulworth *East Stoke *Moreton (part) *Owermoigne (later a separate liberty) *Poxwell *Warmwell *Watercombe (from 1858) *Winfrith Newburgh *Woodsford ==See also== *List of hundreds in Dorset ==Sources== *Boswell, Edward, 1833: The Civil Division of the County of Dorset (published on CD by Archive CD Books Ltd, 1992) *Hutchins, John, History of Dorset, vols 1-4 (3rd ed 1861‚Äì70; reprinted by EP Publishing, Wakefield, 1973) *Mills, A.

He was nicknamed \\"Ciccio\\" throughout his career. ==Career== ===Early career=== Born in Turin, Grabbi began his career with the Juventus youth team. He is also the grandson of former Juventus player Giuseppe Grabbi. He was later promoted to the first team and scored on his debut against Lazio, in one of his total two appearances in the 1994‚Äì95 season. Unable to break into the team, because of his young age and the contemporary explosion of Alessandro Del Piero, he was loaned to Lucchese (76 games, 8 goals) and then Chievo (18 games, 2 goals) before switching to Modena. There he found some real form, scoring 30 times in 58 appearances. This performance saw him signed by Ternana, where he played for one season before been loaned to Ravenna where he scored 13 goals. When he returned to Ternana he became a regular scorer again, with 20 goals in 34 games and became idol for the local supporters, who still remember him as the best player to ever have played for Ternana. ===Blackburn Rovers=== Grabbi's prolific season with Ternana saw him attract attention of various Serie A clubs, including Udinese and AC Milan. But apparently Luciano Moggi of Juventus, who had previously pressured Grabbi to change his agent and join GEA World with no success, made it impossible for Ciccio to play in Italy, so in 2001 he was signed by Blackburn Rovers for a record fee of ¬£6.75 million in July 2001, but due to injuries and personal reasons, he failed to repeat this progress, scoring just once in fourteen league games, his goal coming in a 1‚Äì0 win over Everton. He scored once more before going on loan to Messina, in the FA Cup against Barnsley. Leaving the club on loan meant he missed out on their victory in the 2002 League Cup Final. Grabbi's move to Blackburn is widely regarded as one of the worst transfers in the history of the Premier League.http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article2096584.ece In the same interview, Grabbi stated that the only person who he became friends with in this time was Tugay Kerimoƒülu. Despite his unsuccessful spell at Blackburn Rovers, Grabbi still has a cult following with fans of the club. During a loan spell back in Italy with Messina, he scored two goals in the final game of the season and saved Messina from relegation. Upon his return to England, he failed to reignite his form, and after a further 16 games and three goals (against Liverpool in the league, CSKA Sofia in the UEFA Cup and Walsall in the League Cup) with Blackburn, who had in the meantime signed ex- Manchester United strikers Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole, he was allowed to return to Italy permanently with Ancona in 2004. ===Later career=== After spending one year without a team, trying to recover from the injury caused by a rare form of foot disease (Leveraus Morb) which had afflicted him for the past three seasons, he joined Genoa of Serie C1/A in September 2005. With his new team, he gained promotion to Serie B on playoffs scoring 9 goals in 25 games. Club president Enrico Preziosi decided then that Genoa did not need Grabbi anymore, so during the 2007 winter transfer window, Grabbi signed for Arezzo, still in Serie B, after having never made a single appearance in the first half of the season for Genoa. After relegation with Arezzo, scoring no goals, Grabbi signed a contract with AC Bellinzona, a team from the Swiss Challenge League (second division). Ciccio scored the winning goal (his first after more than one year) in the Swiss Cup game Bellinzona-Gossau: 2‚Äì1 . Grabbi was also directly involved in the Calciopoli scandal of summer 2006 as a victim: It was in fact only then that Ciccio could tell the media what Luciano Moggi had done to affect his career: after Ciccio Grabbi had refused to drop his agent in favour of Luciano Moggi's son, Moggi told him \\"you will never play football again, if not in my garden!\\" Grabbi was propriety of Juventus until he was sold to Ternana. ==Honours== ===Club=== Juventus *Serie A: 1994‚Äì95 *Coppa Italia: 1994‚Äì95 Blackburn Rovers *League Cup: 2001‚Äì02 ==References== ==Websites== *http://www.acbellinzona.ch *http://corradograbbi.blogspot.com/ Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Turin Category:Association football forwards Category:Italian footballers Category:Juventus F.C. players Category:S.S.D.

It was founded by the Suebic king Hermeric in 409, with its capital established in Braga. It was the first kingdom which adopted Catholicism officially. In 449 it minted its own currency. In 585, it became a part of the Visigothic Kingdom. In the 8th century, Galicia became a part of the newly founded Christian Kingdom of Asturias, which later became the Kingdom of Le√≥n, and while occasionally achieving independence under the authority of its own kings. Compostela became capital of Galicia in the 11th century, while the independence of Portugal (1128) determined its southern boundary. The accession of Castilian King Ferdinand III to the Leonese kingdom in 1230 brought Galicia under the control of the Crown of Castile. Galicia resisted central control, supporting a series of alternative claimants, including John of Le√≥n, Galicia and Seville (1296), Ferdinand I of Portugal (1369) and John of Gaunt (1386), and was not brought firmly into submission until the Catholic Monarchs imposed the Santa Hermandad in Galicia. The kingdom of Galicia was then administered within the Crown of Castile (1490‚Äì1715) and later the Crown of Spain (1715‚Äì1833) by an Audiencia Real directed by a Governor which also held the office of Captain General and President. The representative assembly of the Kingdom was then the Junta or Cortes of the Kingdom of Galicia, which briefly declared itself sovereign when Galicia alone remained free of Napoleonic occupation (1808‚Äì1809). The kingdom and its Junta were dissolved by Maria Cristina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Regent of Spain, in 1834. ==Origin and foundation (409)== Theodemar (or Ariamir), king of Galicia with the bishops Lucrecio, Andrew, and Martin. Codex Vigilanus (or Albeldensis), Escurial library The origin of the kingdom lies in the 5th century, when the Suebi settled permanently in the former Roman province of Gallaecia. Their king, Hermeric, probablyThis is a debated point, completely denied by Thompson (2002: 160), but cf. . signed a foedus, or pact, with the Roman Emperor Honorius, which conceded them lands in Galicia. The Suebi set their capital in the former Bracara Augusta, setting the foundations of a kingdom which was first acknowledged as Regnum Suevorum (Kingdom of the Suebi), but later as Regnum Galliciense (Kingdom of Galicia). A century later, the differences between Gallaeci and Suebi people had faded, leading to the systematic use of terms like Galliciense RegnumHistoria Francorum. Gr√©goire de Tours.

(Bishop of Galicia). ==Suebic Kingdom (409‚Äì585)== The independent Suebic kingdom of Galicia lasted from 409 to 585, having remained relatively stable for most of that time. ===5th century=== In 409 Gallaecia was divided, ad habitandum, between two Germanic people, the Hasdingi Vandals, who settled the eastern lands, and the Suebi, who established themselves in the coastal areas. As with most Germanic invasions, the number of the original Suebi is estimated to be relatively low, generally fewer than 100,000,80,000 Vandals and Alans passed into Africa in 429, on the account of Victor Vitensis. and most often around 30,000 people.Cf. Arias (2007) pp. 15‚Äì16. They settled mainly in the regions around modern northern Portugal and Western Galicia, in the towns of Braga (Bracara Augusta) and Porto, and later in Lugo (Lucus Augusta) and Astorga (Asturica Augusta). The valley of the Limia (or Lima) River is thought to have received the largest concentration of Germanic settlers, and Bracara Augusta‚Äîthe modern city of Braga‚Äîbecame the capital of the Suebi, as it had previously been the capital of Gallaecia. In 419 a war broke out between the Vandal king Gunderic and the Suebi's Hermeric. After a blockade alongside the Nervasian Mountains,Thompson (2002) p. 171. the Suebi obtained Roman help, forcing the Vandals to flee into the Baetica.Historians like Jos√© Antonio L√≥pez Silva, translator of Idatius' chronicles, the primary written source for the period, find that the essential temper of Galician culture was established in the blending of Ibero-Roman culture with that of the Suebi.

In the absence of competitors, the Suebi began a period of expansion, first inside Gallaecia, and later into other Roman provinces. In 438 Hermeric ratified a peace treaty with the Gallaeci, the native and partially Romanized people. Illness led Hermeric to abdicate in favor of his son, Rechila, who moved his troops to the south and the east, conquering M√©rida and Seville, the capitals of the Roman provinces of Lusitania and Betica.Thompson (2002) p. 162. In 448 Rechila died, leaving the expanding state to his son Rechiar, who in 449 became one of the first Germanic kings of post-Roman Europe to convert to Catholicism. Rechiar married a Visigothic princess, and was also the first Germanic king to mint coins in ancient Roman territories. Rechiar led further expansions to the east, marauding through the Provincia Tarraconensis, which was still held by Rome. The Roman emperor Avitus sent a large army of foederates, under the direction of the Visigoth Theoderic II, who defeated the Suebi army by the river √ìrbigo, near modern-day Astorga. Rechiar fled, but he was pursued and captured, then executed in 457. In the aftermath of Rechiar's death, multiple candidates for the throne appeared, finally grouping into two allegiances. The division between the two groups was marked by the Minius River (now Minho River), probably as a consequence of the localities of the Quadi and Marcomanni tribes, who constituted the Suebi nation on the Iberian Peninsula.Together with the Suebi came another Germanic tribe, the Buri, that settled in the lands known as Terras de Bouro (Lands of the Buri) in what is now Portugal. The Suebi in the north conquered Lugo, proceeding to use that city as their co-capital, while the Suebi in the south expanded into Lisbon and Conimbriga, which were assaulted, and abandoned after their Roman inhabitants were banished. By 465 Remismund, who established a policy of friendship with the Goths and promoted the conversion of his own people into Arianism, was recognized by his people as the only king of the Suebi.Arias (2007) p. 22 ===6th century=== Miro, king of Galicia, and Martin of Braga, from an 1145 manuscript of Martin's Formula Vitae Honestae,Formula Vitae Honestae now in the Austrian National Library. The book was originally dedicated to King Miro with the header \\"To King Miro, the most glorious and calm, the pious, distinguished for his Catholic faith\\" Galicia, founded in 575 and inhabited until the early 20th century Roman walls of Lugo After a period of obscurity, with very little remaining information on the history of this area, or in fact Western Europe in general,Cf. L√≥pez Carreira (2005) pp. 57‚Äì60.Arias (2007) pp. 24‚Äì25. the Suebi Kingdom reappears in European politics and history during the second half of the 6th century. This is following the arrival of Saint Martin of Braga, a Pannonian monk dedicated to converting the Suebi to Nicene Christianity and consequently into allegiance with the other Nicene Christian regional powers, the Franks and the Eastern Roman Empire.Arias (2007) p. 29 Under King Ariamir, who called for the First Council of Braga, the conversion of the Suebi to Nicene Christianity was apparent; while this same council condemned Priscillianism, it made no similar statement on Arianism. Later, King Theodemar ordered an administrative and ecclesiastical division of his kingdom, with the creation of new bishoprics and the promotion of Lugo, which possessed a large Suebi community, to the level of Metropolitan Bishop along with Braga. Theodemar's son and successor, King Miro, called for the Second Council of Braga, which was attended by all the bishops of the kingdom, from the Briton bishopric of Britonia in the Bay of Biscay, to Astorga in the east, and Coimbra and Idanha in the south. Five of the attendant bishops used Germanic names, showing the integration of the different communities of the country. King Miro also promoted contention with the Arian Visigoths, who under the leadership of King Leovigild were rebuilding their fragmented kingdom which had been ruled mostly by Ostrogoths since the beginning of the 6th century, following the defeat and expulsion of Aquitania by the Franks. After clashing in frontier lands, Miro and Leovigild agreed upon a temporary peace. The Suebi maintained their independence until 585, when Leovigild, on the pretext of conflict over the succession, invaded the Suebic kingdom and finally defeated it. Audeca, the last king of the Suebi, who had deposed his brother-in-law Eboric, held out for a year before being captured in 585. This same year a nobleman named Malaric rebelled against the Goths, but he was defeated.Arias (2007) pp. 32‚Äì33. As with the Visigothic language, there are only traces of the Suebi tongue remaining, as they quickly adopted the local vulgar Latin. Some words of plausible Suebi origin are the modern Galician and Portuguese words laverca (lark), meixengra or mejengra (titmouse), lobio (vine), esc√° (a measure, formerly \\"cup\\"), groba (ravine), and others. Much more significant was their contribution to names of the local toponymy and onomastics. The historiography of the Suebi, and of Galicia in general, was long marginalized in Spanish culture, with the first connected history of the Suebi in Galicia being written by a German scholar.Cf Varias investigaci√≥ns recuperan a memoria do Reino Suevo. 5 / 7 / 2004. ==Visigothic monarchy (585‚Äì711)== { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 87%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:23em; max-width: 25%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  \\"After the death of Miro king of Galicia, and while his son Eboric and his son-in-law Audeca were fighting each other for the control of the kingdom, Leovigild subjugated the Suebi and all of Galicia under the power of the Goths.\\" Chronicle of Fredegar, III. p 116.In Monumenta Germania Historica. -  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  \\"Not only the conversion of the Goths is found among the favors that we have received, but also the infinite multitude of the Sueves, whom with divine assistance we have subjected to our realm.

Therefore, most holy fathers, these most noble nations gained by us, as a holy and atoning sacrifice, by your hands I offer to God eternal.\\" King Reccared, Acts of the Third Council of Toledo. } Political map of southwestern Europe around the year 600, which referred to three different areas under Visigothic government ‚Äì Hispania, Gallaecia, and Septimania Church of Santa Comba de Bande, built c.7th century, rebuilt in the 9th century after being ruined for more than 200 years In 585, Liuvigild, the Visigothic king of Hispania and Septimania, annexed the Kingdom of Galicia, after defeating King Audeca, and later the pretender to the throne, Malaric. Thus the kingdom of the Suebi, which incorporated large territories of the ancient Roman provinces of Gallaecia and Lusitania, became the sixth province of the Visigothic Kingdom of Toledo. The government of the Visigoths in Galicia did not totally disrupt the society, and the Suevi Catholic dioceses of Bracara, Dumio, Portus Cale or Magneto, Tude, Iria, Britonia, Lucus, Auria, Asturica, Conimbria, Lameco, Viseu, and Egitania continued to operate normally. During the reign of Liuvigild, new Arian bishops were raised among the Suebi in cities such as Lugo, Porto, Tui, and Viseu, alongside the cities' Catholic bishops. These Arian bishops returned to Catholicism in 589, when King Reccared himself converted to Catholicism, along with the Goths and Suebi, at the Third Council of Toledo.At that council assisted episcoporum totius Hispaniae, Galliae and Gallaetiae (\\"all bishops of Spain, Gaul, and Galicia\\"), in words of John of Biclara. Cf. Chronicon Iohannis Biclarensis 590.1 = vv 330‚Äì341. The territorial and administrative organization inherited from the Suevi was incorporated into the new Provincial status, although Lugo was reduced again to the category of bishopric, and subjected to Braga.Isla Fern√°ndez (1992) p. 6. Meanwhile, the Suevi, Roman, and Galician cultural, religious, and aristocratic elite accepted new monarchs. The peasants maintained a collective formed mostly by freemen and serfs of Celtic, Roman and Suebi extraction, as no major Visigoth immigration occurred during the 6th and 7th centuries. This continuity led to the persistence of Galicia as a differentiated province within the realm, as indicated by the acts of several Councils of Toledo, chronicles such as that of John of Biclar, and in military laws such as the one extolled by WambaNam et si quilibet infra fines Spanie, Gallie, Gallecie vel in cunctis provinciis Wamba Lex which was incorporated into the Liber Iudicum, the Visigothic legal code. It was not until the administrative reformation produced during the reign of Recceswinth that the Lusitanian dioceses annexed by the Suevi to Galicia (Coimbra, Idanha, Lamego, Viseu, and parts of Salamanca) were restored to Lusitania. This same reform reduced the number of mints in Galicia from a few dozen to just three, those in the cities of Lugo, Braga, and Tui. The most notable person of 7th century Galicia was Saint Fructuosus of Braga. Fructuosus was the son of a provincial Visigoth dux (military provincial governor),San Fructuoso de Braga: vida y novena, Juan Llorens, Vicente Rafael. 2007. p 21. See also . and was known for the many foundations he established throughout the west of the Iberian peninsula, generally in places with difficult access, such as mountain valleys or islands. He also wrote two monastic rulebooks, characterized by their pact- like nature, with the monastic communities ruled by an abbot, under the remote authority of a bishop (episcopus sub regula),Isla Fern√°ndez (1992) pp. 33-34- and each integrant of the congregation having signed a written pact with him. Fructuosus was later consecrated as abbot-bishop of Dumio, the most important monastery of Gallaecia‚Äîfounded by Martin of Braga in the 6th century‚Äîunder Suebi rule. In 656 he was appointed bishop of Braga and metropolitan of Galicia, ostensibly against his own will. During his later years the Visigothic monarchy suffered a pronounced decline, due in large part to a decrease in trade and therefore a sharp reduction in monetary circulation, largely as a result of the Muslim occupations in the early 8th century in the south Mediterranean. The Gallaecia were also affected, and Fructuosus of Braga denounced the general cultural decline and loss of the momentum from previous periods, causing some discontent in the Galician high clergy. At the tenth Council of Toledo in 656, Fructuosus was appointed to the Metropolitan seat of Potamio after the renunciation of its previous occupier. At the same time the Will of the Bishop of Dume Recimiro was declared void after he donated the wealth of the diocese convent to the poor. The crisis at the end of the Visigoth era dates to the reign of Egica. The monarch appointed his son Wittiza as his heir, and despite the fact that the Visigothic monarchy had been traditionally elective rather than hereditary Egica associated Wittiza during his lifetime to the throne (for example, Egica and Wittiza are known to have issued coinage with the confronted effigies of both monarchs). In 701 an outbreak of plague spread westward from Greece to Spain, reaching Toledo, the Visigothic capital, in the same year, and having such impact that the royal family, including Egica and Wittiza, fled. It has been suggestedRoger Collins (2004), Visigothic Spain, 409‚Äì711. (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing.), 110. . that this provided the occasion for sending Wittiza to rule the Kingdom of the Suevi from Tui,As assumed by the 10th century Chronicle of Alfonso III. which is recorded as his capital. The possibility has also been raised that the 13th-century chronicler, Lucas of Tuy, when he records that Wittiza relieved the oppression of the Jews (a fact unknown from his reign at Toledo after his father), may in fact refer to his reign at Lucas' hometown of Tui, where an oral tradition may have been preserved of the events of his Galician reign.Bernard S. Bachrach (1973), \\"A Reassessment of Visigothic Jewish Policy, 589‚Äì711.\\" The American Historical Review, 78:1 (Feb.), pp 31‚Äì32. Lucas' account has a large number of both detractors (Graetz, Katz, and Dahn) and supporters (Scherer, Ziegler, and Altamira) and even if true it is possible that Lucas' story is based on the minutes of XVIII Toledo, which still survived in his time. In 702, with the death of Egica, Wittiza as sole king moved his capital to Toledo. In 710, part of the Visigothic aristocracy violently raised Roderic to the throne, triggering a civil war with the supporters of Wittiza and his sons. In 711, the enemies of Roderic got a Muslim army to cross the Straits of Gibraltar and face him at the Battle of Guadalete. The defeat was the end of Roderic and of the Visigothic rule, with profound consequences for the whole of the Iberian peninsula. ==Early and High Middle Ages== Tombstone of the sepulcher of bishop Theodemar of Iria (d. 847), discoverer of the tomb attributed to apostle Saint James the Great { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 87%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:23em; max-width: 25%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  \\"Alfonso king of Galicia and of Asturias, after having ravaged Lisbon, the last city of Spain, sent during the winter the insignias of his victory, breastplates, mules, and Moor prisoners, through his legates Froia and Basiliscus.\\" Annales regni Francorum, c 798.at the Latin Library. -  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  \\"And so, as I've been told, when Adefonsus departed of this world, as Nepotianus usurped the kingdom of Ramiro, Ramiro went to the city of Lugo in Galicia, and there he reunited the army of the whole province.

Along with the rest of the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, it was free of Arab presence from the mid-8th century, being gradually incorporated into a growing Christian state. This is usually called the Kingdom of Asturias in traditional and modern sources, although the precise historical details of these events have been obscured by the national myths leading to the construction of modern Spanish identity. The 9th century saw this state expand southward, with Castilian and Asturian noblemen acquiring most of the northern Meseta,Isla Frez (1992) pp. 134‚Äì140. while in Galicia, a similar impulse led to the conquest and re-population of the regions of Astorga, southern Galicia, and northern Portugal down to Coimbra, by noblemen mostly proceeding from northern Galicia. Also significant was the pretended discovery of the tomb of Saint James the Great at what would become Santiago de Compostela;This 'discovery' is named 'inventio' in contemporary Latin sources. For the significance of this fact : \\"La invenci√≥n del sepulcro de Santiago de Compostela...\\" the shrine constructed there became the religious center of the nation, as well as being the destination of a major international pilgrimage route, the Way of St. James. This increased the political and military relevance of Galicia, and its noble families aspired to positions of power within the kingdom through either military forceSuch as count Froila of Lugo in the 9th century, who was briefly claimed the crown after expelling Alfonso III. or by matrimonial alliance with the royal family.Queen Elvira, first wife of Ordo√±o II, or queen Goto, wife of Garcia I Ord√≥√±ez, belonged to Galician noble families. Cf. Rodr√≠guez Ferm√°ndez (1997) pp. 40 and 188. To the east, this southern expansion led the capital of the Christian kingdom to be moved to the city of Le√≥n, from which time the state is usually called the Kingdom of Le√≥n. This same kingdom was frequently known as either Gallaecia or Galicia (Yillƒ´qiya and Galƒ´siya) in Al-Andalus Muslim sources up to the 14th century,Cf Carballeira Debasa (2007). as well as by many European Christian contemporaries.Alfonso II of Asturias was addressed as: \\"DCCXCVIII.

This role was assumed by the rural north during the Early and High Middle Ages, as a consequence not only of the Islamic invasion, but as the final result of a continent-wide urban crisis. The old bishoprics of Braga, Ourense, Tui, Lamego, and others, were either discontinued, or re- established in the north, under the protection of Lugo‚Äîwhich was now a stronghold due to its Roman walls‚Äîand Iria Flavia. Dumio was re-established by the Bay of Biscay in Mondo√±edo, Lugo assumed the role of Braga, and the bishops of Lamego and Tui sought refuge in Iria, where they received generous territorial grants. During the 9th, 10th, and 11th centuries most of these bishoprics were re-established in their historical sees, but at this time the bishops of Lugo, Mondo√±edo, and Iria became major political players--not just as religious figures, but also as wealthy, and sometimes mighty, secular powers. In particular, the bishops of Iria and Compostela were notorious warlords,The Historia Compostellana of the 12th century records a popular proverb: \\"Bishop of Santiago: Staff and Crossbow\\" (HC, II.1) due to the many fortresses and military resources they controlled as heads of a military Norman mark,The presence of Norman (Viking) raiders by the coasts of Galicia is constant during much of the 9th, 10th and 11th centuries; even a bishop, Sisenand II, was killed while fighting them, in the Battle of Fornelos, in 977. Cf. as well as due to the wealth that the pilgrimages and royal grants brought to their lands. Each bishopric was divided into a number of territories or counties, named terras, condados, mandationes, commissos, or territorios in local charters,Isla Frez (1992) p. 144. which in the north were true continuations of the Suebic dioceses which frequently preserved old tribal divisions and denominations, such as Lemabos, Celticos, Postamarcos, Bregantinos, and Cavarcos. Rights to the tax collection and government of each territory was granted by the titular ruler‚Äîusually the king‚Äîto a count, bishopric, or large monastery, although there existed some singularities. The bishopric of Lugo was divided into counties, each one under the government of an infanzon (a lesser nobleman) as a concession of the bishop, while in the south, large and mighty territories such as the Portucalense became hereditary, passed down to the descendants of the 9th century's conquerors. In the Terra de Santiago (Land of Saint James, the fief of the bishops of Iria- Compostela) each territory was administered by a bishop's vicar, while justice was administered by a council composed of representatives of the local churchmen, knights, and peasants.L√≥pez Ferreiro (1895) pp. 155‚Äì165. Each territory or county could be further divided into mandationes and decanias. The basic territorial division was the villa, centered on a church, and composed of one or more hamlets or villages, together with all its facilities, lands, and possessions. The villas perpetuated ancient Roman and Suevic foundations, and they were the base for the ecclesiastical organization, and for the economic production of the country, later evolving into the modern parroquias and freguesias (rural parishes). The local economy was subsistence, based mainly on the production of grain and beans, and notably in cattle breeding.The modern Galician, Portuguese and Spanish words for cattle (gando, gado, ganado, respectively) derive from a term meaning per se ‚Äì \\"the earned thing\\". Other valuable‚Äîthough geographically restricted‚Äîproducts included fruits, salt, wine, honey, olive oil, horses, iron for the production of weapons and tools, and exotic oriental fabrics introduced from Spania. There were also specialized artisans who worked on demand, such as masons and goldsmiths. While local commerce was common, long range interchanges‚Äîgenerally maintained by Hebrew merchants‚Äîwere rare and appreciated. Monetary circulation was scarce, composed mainly of old Suebi and Visigothic coinage known locally as solidos gallicianos. War and pillaging against the thriving Al-Andalus was also a very important source for the acquisition of riches, exotic items, and Muslim serfs. Later, pilgrimage of Christians from all over Europe to Santiago de Compostela brought not only riches, but also a range of continental innovations and trends, from shipbuilding, to new architectural styles such as Romanesque art. Romanesque cathedral of San Marti√±o de Mondo√±edo (9th‚Äì11th centuries); first construction dates from the 6th‚Äì7th centuries The elites were composed of counts, dukes, senatores, and other high noblemen, who were frequently related by marriage with the monarch,During the High Middle Ages not unusually a king would refer to a Galician nobleman or to a noblewoman as uncle or aunt. and who usually claimed the most powerful positions in society, either as governors, bishops, or as palatine officials or companions of the king or queen. The Galician nobility however were also frequently found as rebels, either as supporters of a different candidate to the throne, or aspiring to it themselves, or simply as disobedient to the king's orders and will.For instance, the list of the rebels against Alfonso III include in Galicia noblemen such as count Froila Lemundi, who was briefly king; duke Uittiza in southern Galicia, who resisted for seven years; count Flacidio in Lugo; the brothers Aldreto and Flacencius again in Lugo; Oduarius in the east; Hermegildo and Iberia in the west... Cf. Bali√±as P√©rez (1998) pp. 104‚Äì107. At the service of the noblemen were miles (knights) and infanzones; they were often found marching to war with their subalterns on behalf of a patron, or as vicars and administrators. A sizable section of the society were churchmen‚Äîpresbyters, deacons, clergymen, lectors, confessos, monks, and nuns‚Äîwho frequently lived in religious communities, some of which were composed of both men and women living under vows of chastity and poverty. Most of these monasteries were directed by an abbot or abbess, ruled under a pactual tradition heavily influenced by Germanic legal traditions,Cf. Bishko (1984). with a bishop sub regula as the highest authority of the community. Other monasteries used different, sometimes antagonistic rules. The Benedictine and Augustine rules were uncommon until the 11th century. As in most of Europe, the chartulary and chronicle proceedings of monasteries and bishoprics are the most important sources for the study of local history.In Galicia the most important chartularies for the Early and High Middle Ages are those from the monasteries of Sobrado, with documents from the 8th‚Äì13th centuries, Celanova (9th‚Äì13th), Samos (8th‚Äì13th) ... And of the cathedrals of Santiago and Lugo, with documents dated from the 8th century. In Portugal the most notable documentation for the period was edited and published by Alexandre Herculano in the 19th century, under the title Portugaliae Monumenta Historica. By the 12th century the only known bourgeois were the multinational inhabitants of Compostela, by this stage a fortified and strong city. Meanwhile, the City Council of Santiago for centuries had struggled against their bishops for the recognition of a number of liberties. In the country, most people were freemen, peasants, artisans, or infantrymen, who could freely choose a patron, or buy and sell properties, although they frequently fell prey to the greed of the big owners, leading many of them to a life of servitude. Finally, servos, libertos, and pueros (serfs and slaves), either obtained in war with the Moors or through trial, constituted a visible part of the society; they were employed as household workers (domesticos and scancianes), shepherds, and farmhands. Local charters also show that, in time, they were freed.For instance, in the 10th century Saint Rudesind freed his Muslim governess, granting her a series of properties, together with 'Roman citizenship'. In terms of religion, most were Roman Catholics, although the local rites‚Äîknown today as Mozarabic rites‚Äîwere notably different from those used in most of Western Europe. No Arian, Priscillianist, or Pagan organizations are known to have survived during the High Middle Ages.For the pagan survivals: Cf. Stephen McKenna (1938) Paganism and Pagan Survivals in Spain up to the Fall of the Visigothic Kingdom . However, there were still pagans and pagan shrines in the Bierzo region during the 7th century, whilst Arian or Priscillianist tonsure‚Äîseen as long hair, with only a partial tonsure atop the head‚Äîwas in use in Galicia up to 681, when it was forbidden at a council in Toledo. There were no known Muslim communities in Galicia and northern Portugal, other than Moor serfs. Records of Hebrew people are also uncommon in local charters until the 12th century, except as travelers and merchants.Pace Personal names in Galicia and northern Portugal were chiefly of Germanic origin, although Christian, Roman, and Greek names were also common. Names were usually composed just of a single surname, although noblemen frequently also used a patronymic. Muslim names and patronymics were rare amongst Galicians, as even serfs were frequently given a Germanic or Roman name, which is in contrast with the relative popularity of Muslim names amongst the Leonese.For the anthoponymy of medieval Galicia cf.

The youngest brother, Fruela II, received the Asturian heartland in the northeast, with Oviedo as its capital. From Galicia, Ordo√±o launched several successful raids on the Islamic south, returning with riches and Muslim serfs, and confirming himself as an able commander. At the death of Garc√≠a in 914, Ordo√±o also acquired Le√≥n, and on his death in 924 his younger brother, Fruela, reunited Alfonso's realm. Fruela's death a year later initiated a period of chaos, with several claimants to the crown. Fruela's son, Alfonso Fr√≥ilaz, received support from Asturias, but was captured and blinded by Sancho, Alfonso IV, and Ramiro II, sons of Ordo√±o, with the aid of the Basque troops of Jimeno Garc√©s of Pamplona. Vague and conflicting historical records make it uncertain whether Alfonso Fr√≥ilaz reigned briefly as king of the entire kingdom, or simply held a remote part of Asturias.Isla Fernandez (1999) p. 25. In Galicia, Sancho succeeded, being crowned in Santiago de Compostela and marrying a Galician noblewoman. After reigning for just three years he died childless. Alfonso IV then took control of an again-reunited Kingdom of Le√≥n in 929; however, he was forced into a monastery by their youngest brother, Ramiro, two years later.Rodr√≠guez Fern√°ndez (1997) p. 212. Ramiro II had ties with the Galician nobility through kinship, marriage and patronage, and he and his son, Ordo√±o III, whose mother was Galician, reigned with their support. This was not the case when Ordo√±o was succeeded by his half-brother Sancho I of Le√≥n in 956. Sancho proved unpopular and ineffectual and the Galician nobles grew fractious, forming a coalition with Fern√°n Gonz√°lez of Castile to overthrow Sancho in favor of Ordo√±o IV, who was enthroned in Santiago de Compostela in 958.Portela Silva (2001) p. 165. However Sancho reclaimed the crown in 960 with support from his mother's Kingdom of Pamplona, the Leonese nobility, and Muslim assistance.After returning to the throne he frequently spoke of his \\"returning back from Spain\\": \\"Era DCCCCa LXLVIII anno regni nostri quarto & de adventu Spanie secundo\\", (document from the Monastery of Sahag√∫n). On the Muslim support, cf. Isla Fernandez (1992) p. 191. His son, Ramiro III, grew increasingly absolutist, alienating the Galician nobility who also resented the lack of Leonese help when the Normans raided Galicia from 968 through 970.Cf. Isla Fern√°ndez (1999) p. 37. On this particular invasion: The Galician nobility again rose in rebellion, in 982 crowning and anointing Bermudo, son of Ordo√±o III, as king in Santiago de Compostela. With their support, he first repelled the army of Ramiro in the battle of Portela de Areas and eventually made himself undisputed ruler of the Leonese kingdom.Some Leonese and Castilian charters still claim Ramiro as king as late as 985, or even later. Cf. Gregorio del Ser Quijano, Documentaci√≥n de la Catedral de Le√≥n (s. IX-X). Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca. pp. 273‚Äì279. Once in control, Bermudo lost many of his Galician and Portuguese supporters by repudiating his Galician wife in favor of a new marriage alliance with Castile.Isla Fern√°ndez (1992) pp. 194‚Äì195. His later reign was marked by the ascension of a strong military leader, Almanzor, who led a brief resurgence of the Cordoban Caliphate, reconquering Coimbra or Viseu, and even raiding Santiago de Compostela. In the 1030s, Galicia became the sole holdout to the Leonese conquests of Sancho III of Pamplona. When the Count of Castile‚Äînominally a Leonese vassal, but de facto independent‚Äîwas assassinated in Le√≥n in 1029, Sancho claimed the right to name the successor, giving it to his own son Ferdinand. Taking advantage of the youth of Leonese king Bermudo III, Sancho seized disputed border regions, formalizing the arrangement by including the lands in the dowry of Bermudo's sister, who was married to Ferdinand in 1032. Two years later, in 1034, Sancho took Bermudo's capital, becoming de facto ruler of most of the kingdom, whilst leaving Bermudo to rule from his refuge in Galicia. Sancho's death the next year allowed Bermudo to regain not only the entire kingdom, but to briefly become overlord of Ferdinand's Castile. However, in 1037, the Castilian count killed Bermudo in battle, and Galicia passed with the Kingdom of Le√≥n into the hands of Ferdinand, who then had himself crowned king. thumbrightPolitical situation in the Northern Iberian Peninsula around 1065: Ferdinand's death in 1065 led to another short-lived Galician state. In 1063 he had opted to partition his realm,Portela Silva (2001) pp. 47‚Äì48. giving the eastern Kingdom of Castile to his eldest son, Sancho II, along with the right to the paria (tribute) from the Taifa of Zaragoza. His second son Alfonso VI was given the Kingdom of Le√≥n, representing the central portion of the old realm, with the paria from Toledo. His youngest son, Garc√≠a II, who had been educated in Galicia under the tutelage of bishop Cresconius of Compostela, received the western half of Bermudo's old kingdom as King of Galicia, along with the right to parias from the Taifas of Badajoz and Seville. As king, Garcia aimed to restore the old episcopal sees of Tui, Lamego, and Braga, which had been dissolved due to Arab and Viking assaults.Reilly (1998) p. 26. The death of two of his most notable supporters, bishops Cresconius of Compostela and Uistrarius of Lugo, left the young king in a weaker position, and in 1071 the Count of Portugal, Nuno Mendes, rose in rebellion. Garc√≠a defeated and killed him in the same year at the Battle of Pedroso,Reilly (1998) p. 27. and in recognition of his solidified control adopted the title King of Galicia and Portugal. However his brothers, Alfonso and Sancho, immediately turned on the victor, forcing Garc√≠a to flee, first to central Portugal and later‚Äîafter defeating him near Santar√©m‚Äîinto exile in Seville in 1072.Reilly (1998) p. 28. Garc√≠a's realm was divided, with Alfonso joining the county of Portugal to his Kingdom of Le√≥n, while Sancho held the north. This situation was inherently unstable, with Sancho's lands separated by Alfonso's Le√≥n, and the two soon fought a war in which Sancho proved victorious, forcing Alfonso into exile and reuniting all of Ferdinand's kingdom except the autonomous city of Zamora, held by his sister Urraca. While besieging this town in 1072, Sancho was assassinated, inducing Alfonso to return and claim the entire realm. Garc√≠a also returned in 1073 from his exile, either with the hope of re-establishing himself in Galicia, or simply having been misled by promises of safety from Alfonso, however he was imprisoned by Alfonso for the rest of his life, dying in 1091.Portela Silva (2001) pp. 140‚Äì142. As an aftermath to these events, before 1088 Alfonso deposed the bishop of Compostela, Diego Pelaez, who was charged \\"on trying to deliver the Kingdom of Galicia [\\"Galleciae Regnum\\"] to the king of the English and of the Normans [William the Conqueror], while taking it away from the kings of the Spaniards\\".\\"quod Gallaecia Regnum prodere Regi Anglorum & Normannorum & auferre Regi Hispanorum satageret.\\", is Expa√±a Sagrada, XX, II.II. Cf. . On the deposition of Diego Pel√°ez, Portela Silva (2001) pp. 137‚Äì139. Cf. also Medieval culture and the Mexican American borderlands, pp. 172ss. This reunion with the Kingdom of Le√≥n would prove permanent, although both kingdoms maintained their separate personality. ===Raymond of Burgundy=== Queen Urraca ruled Galicia with her husband, Raymond of Burgundy, until the death of her father Alfonso VI. Medieval portrait, Tumbo A chartulary of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela In 1091 the daughter of King Alfonso VI, infanta Urraca, married a Burgundian nobleman, Raymond of Burgundy, who had participated in the Crusades against the Almoravids. His military victories as well as his Anscarid lineage justified this union, and Alfonso bestowed on him the government of Galicia between Cape Ortegal and Coimbra, as a personal fief.The charters he issued shows a man whose authority, although derived of that of his father-in-law, was absolute: ego comes domnus Raimundus, totius Gallecie imperator seu Adefonsi Tolletane principis gener (document from the chartulary known as Tumbo A, cathedral of Santiago, 1107. In This union gave rise to the House of Burgundy, which would rule in Galicia, Le√≥n, and Castile until the death of King Peter. Two years after Raymond's marriage, in 1093, another French crusader, his cousin Henry, the grandson of Duke Robert I of Burgundy and nephew of Alfonso's queen, was given the hand of the Alfonso's illegitimate daughter Theresa, receiving lands in Castille. Both Burgundians were close allies in the affairs of the realm, ratifying a pact of friendship where Raymond promised his cousin the Kingdom of Toledo or the Kingdom of Galicia, together with a third of his treasure, in return for Henry's aid in acquiring the crown as successor of King Alfonso.Reilly (1982) p. 27. However, by 1097 King Alfonso granted Henry the counties of Portugal and Coimbra, from the river Minho to the Tagus,Reilly (1982) p. 29. thus limiting the powers of Raymond, who by this time was securing an important nucleus of partisans in Galicia, including Count Pedro Fr√≥ilaz de Traba, whilst appointing his own notary, Diego Gelm√≠rez, as bishop of Compostela. In successive years he also obtained the government of Zamora, Salamanca, and √Åvila, but he died in 1107, two years before King Alfonso, who was now in his seventies. The government of Galicia and their other possessions was retained by Alfonso's widow, Urraca, who styled herself Mistress and Empress of Galicia.totius Gallecie domina (Santiago, 1107), tocius Gallecie imperatrix (Lugo, 1108). Cf. Reilly (1982) p. 48, 50. King Alfonso, in a council held in Le√≥n, asked the magnates of Galicia to swear an oath on the defense of the rights of his grandson, Alfonso Raim√∫ndez, to the kingdom of Galicia, in case his mother Urraca remarried.Reilly (1982) p. 49. On June 30, 1109, King Alfonso VI died. He was succeeded by Queen Urraca, who was remarried in 1109 to the king of Aragon, Alfonso the Battler, a soldier by nature who was immediately received as king in Castille and Le√≥n, but not in Galicia. As part of the marriage settlement, any children born to the union were to have priority over Raymond's son Alfonso in the succession. In Galicia this union was rejected by the old party of count Raymond, now led by count Pedro Fr√≥ilaz, tutor of young Alfonso, although the partisans of Urraca also joined forces.Villaca√±as Berlanga (2006) p. 361. With Leon and Castille quiet and under control, Alfonso moved on Galicia in 1110, and while he did not suffer any major defeat, he had little success, returning three months later to Le√≥n. Probably as a consequence of this development, Pedro Froila drew Diego Gelmirez to his party. In 1111, the young Alfonso Raim√∫ndez was crowned and anointed king in Compostela.Villaca√±as Berlanga (2006) p. 363. ===Separation of the County of Portugal (1128)=== Political Map of the northwest Iberian peninsula at the end of the 12th century On the death of Henry in 1112, his widow Theresa succeeded him as head of the two Counties of Portugal and Coimbra, during the minority of her son, Afonso Henriques. Two trends emerged at this time, firstly a policy of rapprochement with the new King Alfonso VII, and secondly the maintenance of their power with the aim that the heir to the county would be proclaimed king. The increasing importance of Santiago de Compostela‚Äînow metropolitan church of Lusitania, which was in open competition with Braga, metropolitan church of Galicia‚Äîand the support for Theresa's rule north of the Minho brought about by her romantic union with Fernando P√©rez de Traba altered the status quo. The Archbishop of Braga, who had suffered the nocturnal theft of the relics of Fructuosus of Braga by Diego Gelmirez in 1102,Fletcher (1984) p. 115. and the major Portuguese aristocrats who were pursuing a larger territorial authority, gave support to the royal pretensions of Afonso Henriques. Given this situation, King Alfonso VII marched on Portugal, taking first Tui and other territories north of the river Minho, later besieging Guimar√£es and obtaining the submission of the Portuguese.Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) pp. 231‚Äì236. Several months later, in 1128, inspired by the shortcomings of Afonso Henriques, the Galician and Portuguese troops of Theresa and Fernando Perez de Trava entered Portugal, but the men of Afonso scored a decisive victory at the Battle of S√£o Mamede. The later death of Theresa, and Afonso's success against the Moors at the Battle of Ourique, led to him being proclaimed King of the Portuguese in 1139, this independence being recognized at the Treaty of Zamora in 1143. Still, the status of frontier lands such as Toro√±o and Limia in southern Galicia led to frequent border conflicts during most of the Lower Middle Ages.Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) pp. 237‚Äì247. ===Compostelan Era (1111‚Äì1230)=== { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 87%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:23em; max-width: 25%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  Excerpts from the Historia Compostelana -  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  The laws, the rights, the peace, the justice, called the Galician to arms; everything which is wrong threw the Aragonese into every kind of crime.

Chartulary of the monastery of Toxosoutos, Lousame, 13th century At Santiago de Compostela on September 17, 1111 the Galician high nobility crowned Alfonso VII, the son of Raymond and Urraca, as king of Galicia, and he was anointed by bishop Diego Gelm√≠rez; the coronation was led by Pedro Fr√≥ilaz de Traba, who had been Alfonso's mentor throughout his childhood.\\"\\" (HISTORIA COMPOSTELLANA, I.108) Cf. The coronation was intended to preserve the rights of the son of Raymond of Burgundy in Galicia, at a time when Urraca effectively delivered the kingdoms of Castile and Le√≥n to her new husband, Alfonso the Battler of Aragon and Navarre. The ceremony in Compostela was more symbolic than effective, and Diego Gelm√≠rez, Pedro Fr√≥ilaz, and other Galician nobles headed first to Lugo, and later to the royal seat in Le√≥n to enthrone Alfonso VII there. However, they were intercepted at Viadangos, near Le√≥n, by the troops of Alfonso the Battler. The Galician knights charged, but they were outnumbered and surrounded by the Aragonese infantry, who defeated the Galicians and frustrated their plans. Pedro Fr√≥ilaz was taken prisoner, whilst other nobles were killed, but bishop Gelm√≠rez managed to escape, delivering his prot√©g√©, the young king, to his mother,Villaca√±as Berlanga (2006) p. 364. who began acting against her new husband. From then until Alfonso VII came of age and Urraca died, the entire realm lived under a constant state of civil war, experiencing frequent seizures and shifting alliances between mother and child, and between Urraca and her Aragonese husband.Villaca√±as Berlanga (2006) pp. 364‚Äì381. This same civil war was evident in the kingdom of Galicia, where partisans of Diego Gelmirez, of Pedro Fr√≥ilaz, and of other nobles and warlords, found themselves battling each other as defenders of either Queen Urraca or King Alfonso VII, or under their own agenda,A number of authors consider that Diego Gelm√≠rez and Pedro Fr√≥ilaz aspired to the full independence of the Kingdom. Cf, as an example, Villaca√±as Berlanga (2006) p. 362. whilst Alfonso of Arag√≥n and Theresa of Portugal also had their own supporters. With Calixtus II, uncle of Alfonso VII, becoming Pope, Diego Gelm√≠rez secured the elevation of Compostela into an archdiocese in 1120 through a steady flow of generous donations sent to Rome.The number and amount of these donations, together with the correspondence interchanged by Diego Gelm√≠rez and the Pope's representatives has been preserved in the Historia Compostellana. Bishop Diego attempted to gain recognition for Compostela by becoming primate of Spain, but lost the title to Toledo, the old Visigoth capital. Later, however, he sought to have Compostela recognized as the metropolitan church of the Kingdom of Galicia, in opposition to the church of Braga, which had been the metropolitan since at least the days of Martin of Dumio. Calixtus II did not grant Gelmirez's claims, but finally decided to enlarge Compostela's jurisdiction in an anomalous fashion: instead of Galicia, Compostela was granted control over the old jurisdiction of M√©rida, the former metropolitan church of Lusitania, which was then under Muslim control without a bishop.Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) p. 219-223. Consequently, the bishops of Coimbra, Lamego, Viseu, or Salamanca, among others, were subjected to the rule of Compostela. Braga, metropolitan of the cities of Galicia other than Compostela, found itself limited by the jurisdiction of the latter, and became the centre of the movement for the independence of Portugal. In 1128 the leader of the Galician nobility, Fernando Peres de Trava, together with his lover Countess Theresa of Portugal, who were acting with absolute liberty in most of Galicia and Portugal,Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) p. 224-230. were defeated by Afonso Henriques, Theresa's son. This was the foundation of the future kingdom of Portugal. On his death in 1156, Alfonso VII divided his domains under pressure from the Castilian and Galician nobles,Villaca√±as Berlanga (2006) p. 414. bequeathing Le√≥n and Galicia to his second son, Ferdinand II. Ferdinand, who had been using the title of King of Galicia at least since 1152,tenente Gallicie rex Fernandus (chartulary of the monastery of Xuvia, 1152); Adefonsus Ymperator, una cum coniuge sua dona Riga dominante regnante in tota Yspania.

In 1158 the death of his brother Sancho III of Castile permitted him to intervene the Castilian internal affairs,Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) p. 255-256. which led him to use the title Rex Hispaniarum.Cf. In his own realm, he continued his father's policiesAlfonso VII had yet granted a constitutional charter on Allariz in 1152, while the consuetudinal \\"practices and customs\\" of Santiago de Compostela's townspeople had been approved by Count Raymond back in 1095. by granting Cartas P√≥voa or Foros (constitutional charters) to towns such as Padr√≥n, Ribadavia, Noia, Pontevedra and Ribadeo,Cf. most of them possessing important harbors or sited in rich valleys. Thus he promoted the growth of the bourgeoisie and improved the local economy through the expansion of commerce. He also contributed to the economic and artistic development of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, at least after the death of bishop Martin in 1168, and under the rule of two of his closest subjects, bishops Pedro Gudesteiz and Pedro Su√°rez de Deza.Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) 261‚Äì267. Ferdinand died in 1188, in Benavente, leaving two main claimants to the throne: his sons Sancho, born of a Castilian noblewoman, and Alfonso, from Ferdinand's first marriage, to Urraca of Portugal. Alfonso, supported by the Galician nobility and by the archbishop of Compostela Pedro Su√°rez de Deza,Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) p. 268. hastened to Santiago de Compostela carrying the remains of his father and proclaiming himself King there.Villaca√±as Berlanga (2006) pp. 472‚Äì473. Unlike his father, he dropped the title of \\"King of the Spains\\", preferring the use of \\"King of Le√≥n\\" and \\"King of Le√≥n and Galicia\\".\\"Rex Legionis\\" and \\"Rex Legionis et Gallcie\\". Cf. Alfonso IX's long reign was characterized by his rivalry with Castile and Portugal,Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) pp. 268‚Äì284. and by the promotion of the royal power at the expense of the church and nobility, whilst maintaining his father's urban development policies.Villaca√±as Berlanga (2006) pp. 468‚Äì469. He was one of the first European monarchs to call for a general council, summoning not only the nobility and the Church, but also the inhabitants of the towns and cities, presaging modern representative parliaments.Villaca√±as Berlanga (2006) pp. 473‚Äì474 and Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) p. 318. The last years of his reign were also marked by the conquest of large areas of what is now Extremadura (including the cities of C√°ceres, M√©rida and Badajoz) then in the hands of the Almohad Caliphate, a territory also wanted by the Portuguese.Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) pp. 305‚Äì307. Alfonso granted constitutional charters to the towns of Betanzos, A Coru√±a, Baiona, Salvaterra de Mi√±o, Ver√≠n, Monforte de Lemos, O Valadouro, Milmanda, Bo Burgo de Castro Caldelas, Melide, Sarria and Triacastela,Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) pp. 289‚Äì295. sited in good harbors along the Galician coastline, by the Mi√±o river, or at major crossroads in the country. These new reguengo villages (royal villages under direct royal political and economical control, and administered by their autonomous city councils), each one usually known as a burgo due to its walled circuits, attracted peasants, who could find better living conditions under the direct protection of the king than abroad under the authority of a bishop, a monastery or a nobleman; they also attracted foreigners,For the first time we know of Jewish communities established in Galicia during the 12th and 13th centuries. Cf. Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) pp. 288. most notably artisans and merchants, who brought new trends and knowledge. These burgs effected a revolution in the social structure of the time, leading to economic diversification, removing the dominant autarky of the previous centuries, and facilitating the development of fishing and pre-industrial mass production of some resources, especially salted and dried fish, fish oil, and wine, marketed through the seaports to England and the Mediterranean.L√≥pez Carreira (1999) pp. 223‚Äì225. { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 87%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:23em; max-width: 25%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\" -  'I, Alfonso, by the grace of God King of Le√≥n and of Galicia, by this writing, which is to be forever valid (...)

L√≥pez Carreira (1999) p. 241. These new burgs also allowed a number of minor noble houses to consolidate power by occupying the new administrative and political offices, in open competition with the new classes: mayors, aldermen (regedores, alcaldes, justi√ßas), agents and other officials (procuradores, notarios, avogados) and judges (juizes) of the town council; or mordomos and vigarios (leader and deputies) of the diverse guilds.Cf. L√≥pez Carreira (1999) pp. 242‚Äì266. Throughout this century there was also a rapid growth of the rural population, resulting in a larger force of farm labor which consequently allowed the great monasteries to develop new agricultural lands. This, coupled with the improvement of farming equipment and techniques, such as the introduction of the heavy wheeled plough, resulted in an increase in productivity that impacted the people's lifestyles. The distribution of this increased productivity between peasants and lords was regulated by the establishment of foros or lifelong contracts, frequently spanning several generations or vozes. The economic and social transformations led to profound changes in mindset. In the towns, it initiated a religious and intellectual renewal under the mendicant orders, most notably the Franciscans, who instituted social reforms. Compostela, \\"capital and looking glass\\" of the Kingdom of Galicia, became a showcase of this thriving era, reflected in Master Matthew's work in the granite of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela‚Äîespecially in the Portico da Gloria and in Prateria's fa√ßade‚Äîdemonstrating a prosperity also witnessed through the numerous surviving Romanesque buildings in Galicia. This period is also responsible for Latin literary creations such as the Codex CalixtinusGonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) pp. 357‚Äì359. and the Historia Compostellana. The Historia is an extensive chronicle of the deeds of the bishop of Compostela, Diego Gelmirez, and, though partisan, it is a source of great significance for the understanding of contemporary events and Galician society in the first half of the 12th century. ===Union under the Crown of Castile (1230)=== In the early Medieval era, a fluid pattern of union and division was observed among the states of Christian Iberia. While marriage of royals had resulted in the union of some of these states‚Äîfor example between Navarre and Aragon, and Castile and Le√≥n‚Äîsubsequent divisions amongst heirs created a dynamic pattern of union and separation. However, the 12th century initiated a series of unions that would prove permanent. Alfonso IX married twice. From his first marriage to Teresa of Portugal he had a son, Ferdinand, and two daughters, Sancha and Aldonza. From his second marriage to Berengaria of Castile, he had five children: Eleanor, who died as a child, a second Ferdinand, Alfonso, Berengaria, and Constance. The death of Alfonso IX's son from his first marriage, Ferdinand, in 1214 left the younger Ferdinand, from his second marriage, as heir to his father. When the Castilian king, Henry I, died in 1217 and Berengaria ceded her rights to her son, Ferdinand became King of Castile, against the will of his father.Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) p. 361. To preserve the independence of his realm, Alfonso IX applied customary Galician-Leonese inheritance to nominate Aldonza as future Queen of Galicia, and Sancha as Queen of Le√≥n, enlisting their uncle Afonso II of Portugal to support their succession.Cf. Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) p. 360, where he anyway just mentions the Galician consuetudinary laws which equates the rights of women and men. Alfonso died in 1230 in Sarria, while on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela to thank the apostle for his help in the conquest of Extremadura, and his body was taken there for burial.Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) p. 286. Most of the Leonese nobility cleaved to Ferdinand, who also gained the support of the new Portuguese king, Sancho II. After clashes in Le√≥n and Galicia, Alfonso IX's two former wives, Berengaria and Theresa, reached an agreement whereby Theresa induced Aldonza and Sancha to abandon their regal claims in exchange for an annuity.Cf. Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) p. 360-366. As a result, Ferdinand III became successor to Alfonso's kingdoms of Le√≥n and Galicia, bringing about a permanent union into what would come to be called the Crown of Castile, wherein the kingdoms continued as administrative entities under the unified rule of a single monarch.

Year 1228. Miniatures from a manuscript of the Cantigas de Santa Maria Sepulchre of the knight Sueiro Gomes de Soutomaior. The inscription, in Galician, reads \\"[Here] lies Sueiro Gomes de Souto Maior, who died [...]\\": SUEIRO GOMES DE SOUTO MAIOR Q FALECEU Latinate Galician charters from the 8th century onward show that the local written Latin was heavily influenced by local spoken romance, yet not until the 12th century do we find evidence for the identification of the local language as a language different from Latin itself.As an example, in a passage of the Historia Compostellana it is stated, as a notable event, that bishop Diego Gelmirez spoke publicly in Latin. During this same 12th century we can find full Galician sentences being inadvertently used inside Latin texts,Cf Souto Cabo 2008. whilst its first reckoned use as a literary language dates to the last years of the 12th century.Queixas Zas (2001) p. 14. The linguistic stage from the 13th to the 15th centuries is usually known as Galician-Portuguese (or Old Portuguese, or Old Galician) as an acknowledgement of the cultural and linguistic unity of Galicia and Portugal during the Middle Ages, as both linguistic varieties differed only in minor dialectal phenomena, and were considered by contemporaries as just one language. This language flourished during the 13th and 14th centuries as a language of culture, developing a rich lyric tradition of which some 2000 compositions (cantigas, meaning 'songs') have been preserved‚Äîa few hundred even with their musical score‚Äîin a series of collections, and belonging to four main genres: Love songs, where a man sings for his love; Cantiga de amigo, where a woman sings for her boyfriend; crude, taunting and sexual Songs of Scorn; and religious songs.Queixas Zas (2001) pp. 24‚Äì61. Its most notable patrons‚Äîthemselves well-known authors‚Äîwere kings Dom Dinis in Portugal, and Alfonso X the Learned in Galicia, who was a great promoter of both Galician and Castilian Spanish languages. The noble houses of both countries also encouraged literature in Galician-Portuguese, as being an author or bringing famous troubadours into one's home became a way of promoting social prestige; as a result many noblemen, businessmen and clergymen of the 13th and 14th centuries became notable authors, such as Paio Gomes Charinho, lord of Rianxo, and the aforementioned kings. Aside from the lyric genres, Galicia also developed a minor tradition of literary prose,Queixas Zas (2001) pp. 66‚Äì74. most notably translations of European popular series, such as those dealing with king Arthur written by Chretien de Troyes, or those based on the war of Troy, usually commissioned by noblemen who desired to read these romances in their own language. Other genres include history books (either translations of Spanish ones, or original creations like the Chronicle of St. Mary of Iria, by Rui Vasques), religious books, legal studies, and a treatise on horse breeding. Prose literary creation in Galician had stopped by the 16th century, when the printing press became popular; the first complete translation of the Bible was not printed until the 20th century. As for other written uses of Galician, legal charters (last wills, hirings, sales, constitutional charters, city council books of acts, guild constitutions, books of possessions, and any type of public or private contracts and inventories) written in Galicia are to be found from 1230 to 1530‚Äîthe earliest one a document from the monastery of Melon, dated in 1231.Souto Cabo (2008) p. 51. Galician was by far the most-used language during the 13th to 15th centuries, in preference to Latin. Whilst the written use of Castilian in Galicia had been common since 1400, at least in the documents issued by the offices of foreigners established in the country,Mari√±o Paz (1998) pp. 201‚Äì230. since 1500 the open substitution of Galician elites by Castilian officials led to the progressive discrimination against the Galician language and even the Galician people, although public inscriptions in tombstones and foundations were still common during much of the 16th century. These developments led to the appearance of a series of literary and historical works, the goal of which was the vindication of Galician history, language, people and culture, most notably during the 17th and 18th centuries.Mari√±o Paz (1998) pp. 231‚Äì265. Later Galician language would become a regional language, with just minor literary use up to the 19th century, when a thriving literature developed. As Galician had no official recognition, no legal Galician documents were issued again up to the last quarter of the 20th century. ===Galicia and the Castilian Crown=== Romance portrait of Castilian King Ferdinand III; flanking him are the canting arms of his kingdoms, the purple lion of Le√≥n, and the castle of Castile The rule of Ferdinand IIIAfter the acquisition of the kingdoms of Le√≥n and Galicia he signed as King of Castile and Toledo, of Le√≥n and Galicia (‚ÄúRex Catelle et Toleti, Legionis et Gallecie‚Äù). Posterior monarchs would add their new acquired titles to this growing list: Seville, Granada, Aragon, Neaples, Sicilly, etcetera. initiated a gradual decline in the influence of Galicia in the politics of state, in which the aristocracy and the Galician city councils would lose power to the local bishops.L√≥pez Carreira (2005) pp. 396‚Äì397. Galicia found itself on the periphery of the enlarged kingdom, which was largely ruled from Toledo or Seville, and increasingly controlled by Castilians. The royal court abandoned Compostela and began a policy of centralization. Despite this, Galician nobles and bishops continued to exercise a degree of autonomy from the Castilian crown until the time of the Catholic Monarchs. In 1231 Fernando established in his newly acquired kingdoms positions known in Galicia as meyrino maor,Cf. Garc√≠a Oro (1987) vol. I, pp. 26‚Äì27. These officials were known as merino mayor in Spanish, in Castile and Le√≥n. a high official and personal representative of the king, in 1251 substituted by an adelantado mayor (Galician: endeantado maior), with even greater powers. These officials were established in each one of the three old Christian kingdoms (Galicia, Le√≥n and Castile); in the vassal Kingdom of Murcia; and in the frontier with the Muslims, 'La Frontera'.Cf. Garc√≠a Oro (1987) vol. I, pp. 26‚Äì27; and Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) pp. 363‚Äì364. During the 13th and the 14th centuries these positions were occupied either by local noblemen‚Äîsuch as Estevan Fernandes de Castro, Paio Gomes Chari√±o, Fernando Jos√© de Estrada, or Afonso Suares de Deza‚Äîor by members of the royal family, such as the infante Felipe, son of Sancho IV, thus maintaining a state of fluid relations and communications between the Crown and the Kingdom, which would prove fruitful during the conquest and colonization of Seville and other Andalusian cities.Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) pp. 373‚Äì378. Ferdinand's policy of centralization was continued during the reign of his son Alfonso X: during a period of unrest in Compostela, with the city council at odds with the archbishop, he introduced an alcalde, or representative of the Crown, into the local government,Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) p. 390. later delivering the see of Compostela to a Castilian, after forcing Archbishop Gonsalvo Gomes to flee to France.Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) p. 391. This started a process that eventually led to the replacement of Galician bishops, abbots, and noblemen by Castilians during the 15th and successive centuries. Unlike his father, he usually favoured the bourgeois through the concession of numerous constitutional charters to new towns,Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) pp. 388. angering the nobility. While the Castilian (Castile-Toledo) and Leonese (Galicia and Le√≥n) crowns were linked in the person of the king, both crowns retained political peculiarities.L√≥pez Carreira (2005) p. 396. Galicia and Le√≥n retained the legal code Liber Iudicium and their own parliament (Cortes). Also, whilst the public charters within the kingdom of Galicia continued to be written in Galician, documents from the royal court were issued only in Castilian. The creation in 1282 of a joint Brotherhood (league) of the Kingdoms of Le√≥n and Galicia showed the existence of a grade of unrest in the old western kingdoms of the Crown.'Germanitas Regnorum Legionis et Gallecie'. Cf. Garcia Oro (1987) vol. I, p. 69 and ===John, king of Le√≥n, Galicia and Seville (1296‚Äì1301)=== Paio G√≥mez Chari√±o's Tomb, Convent of San Francisco, Pontevedra, Galicia The reign of Alfonso X ended in civil war and political instability regarding the succession. The death of his eldest son Ferdinand de la Cerda led Ferdinand's younger brother, Sancho, to rebel in a bid to secure the succession, which was ultimately successful. A similar pattern then followed Sancho's own death in 1295, with the reign of his juvenile son Ferdinand IV of Castile being contested by his uncle John, who had been in revolt since 1286.Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) pp. 406‚Äì415. With the help of King Denis I of Portugal, John‚Äîwho lived exiled in Granada‚Äîadvanced to Badajoz to claim the throne of Castile, but negotiations with Ferdinand's party, together with the assassination of his closest ally the adelantado mayor of Galicia Paio G√≥mez Charinho, led him to withdraw his claim.Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) pp. 415‚Äì416. In 1296 John took the lead of the nobility of the old Leonese crown, and with the support of the kings of Aragon and Portugal was proclaimed king of Le√≥n and Galicia in 1296, which also included the Kingdom of Seville, a vassal of Galicia since the 11th century. Charinho was succeeded by Fernando Ru√≠z de Castro, a kinsman of the house of Traba, whose wife also supported John and encouraged calls for a rapprochement with Portugal.Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) pp. 419‚Äì420. This attempted secession lasted five years amid great political and military instability due to opposition from many sectors of society, including the party of Sancho's widow Maria de Molina, which was supported by the Castilian nobility, and the high Galician clergy. Faced with this resistance, King Denis of Portugal proposed to Queen Maria de Molina that John and his heirs should be granted the Kingdom of Galicia, where he counted on the strong support of Fernando Ruiz de Castro and other noblemen.\\"E en el pleito avianle tratado e puesto de esta manera, que diesen luego al infante Don Juan todo el reino de Galicia, e que se llamase ende Rey\\", Cr√≥nica General del Rey Don Fernando IV, cap IV, in Gonz√°lez L√≥pez (1978) pp. 422‚Äì423. In 1301, however, after losing the support of the King of Portugal, John was forced to abandon his claim to kingship in exchange for a number of minor titles, thus confirming the unity of the Crown of Castile. ===Unrest in the cities=== Ruins of the castle of A Rocha Forte, torn down in 1467 by the Irmandi√±os. There B√©renger de Landore's men assassinated the members of the Council of Compostela in 1320. Sepulchre of Alvaro Paz Carneiro, church of St. Mary 'A Nova' in Noia, 'who died in the Mortality, August 15, 1348' After John's challenge, Ferdinand decided to send his brother Don Felipe to Galicia as Adelantado Mayor; he would later be granted the title of Pertigueiro Maior, or first minister and commander of the Terra de Santiago. For nearly thirty years he would act as alter ego of the king, closely supported by the local nobility.Garcia Oro (1987) vol. I pp. 61‚Äì87. The beginning of the 14th century was characterized by the civil unrest in the cities of the kingdom,L√≥pez Carreira 1999, 281‚Äì290. most notably in Lugo, Tui, Ourense and Compostela. The aspiration of their city councils to become reguengas--i.e., direct dependencies of the king, and as such virtually autonomous republics under the direction of their elected councils--which placed them in direct conflict with their bishops, intent on maintaining their fiefs. This unrest was not new, as Compostela had known bloody conflicts between the bourgeois and the bishops since the first years of the 12th century, when the bishop Gelmirez himself was chased inside the city.His flight was itself an astonishing Hollywood story, narrated in the Historia Compostellana, I.114‚Äì116. In these conflicts, Don Felipe and the local nobility usually supported the councils' pretensions in opposition to the mighty and rich bishops,Garcia Oro (1987) vol. I pp. 62. although most of the time the military and economic influence of the archbishop of Santiago proved determinative in the maintenance of the status quo.Garcia Oro (1987) vol. I pp. 63‚Äì64. The conflict in the City of Compostela reached its zenith in September 1320, when, after forty years of autonomyL√≥pez Carreira 1999, 284. and two years of war, the new archbishop, the French B√©renger de Landore, assassinated the nobleman Alonso Su√°rez de Deza together with the members of the City Council in his castle, A Rocha Forte near Santiago, where he had lured them for talks.Garcia Oro (1987) vol. I p. 80. While Berenger's forcefulness temporarily pacified the city, he still had to fight for another year just to take the rest of the fiefdom. However, twenty-five years later, the City Council of Compostela obtained the long-sought reguengo status from King Alfonso XI.Garcia Oro (1987) vol. I pp. 96. Similar conflicts are known to have occurred in other Galician cities. In 1348, the Black Death, locally known as A Mortaldade, reached the ports of Galicia, decimating the population,It came to the world such a pestilence and death of people that most of them were gone, charter from Baiona (1349) in L√≥pez Carreira 1999, 185. and causing a severe and lasting economic crisis.Barros Guimer√°ns 1988, 37. ===Civil War of the Castilian Crown (1366‚Äì1369)=== Battle of Najera. Galician armies fought with Pedro I and Edward of Woodstock, defeating the Castilian armies of Henry of Trast√°mara In 1360 the kingdom of Galicia was again at the centre of a succession crisis, this time of European dimension. The throne of Castile was disputed between King Peter I and his half-brother, Henry Count of Trast√°mara, within the broader context of the Hundred Years' War.L√≥pez Carreira 1999, 290‚Äì291. This fratricidal conflict lasted from 1354 to 1369, having its origin in the policies of Peter I, who tried to expand his royal power while leaning on the municipal councils; this would come at the expense of the high nobility, including Castilian families such as Pimentel, Ponce de Le√≥n, Mendoza, Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, and Alvarez de Toledo; and Galician ones such as Castro. As a result, in 1354 a coalition of nobles rose in defence of a pactual monarchy,Garcia Oro 1987, vol. I, 103. although this coalition did not last long. Henry, illegitimate son of Alfonso XI of Castile and half-brother of Peter, took advantage of the dissatisfaction among the noblemen to launch a war against Peter, with the support of Peter IV of Aragon, with whom Peter I was already at war, and along companies of mercenaries such as that commanded by Bertrand du Guesclin. Meanwhile, Peter I drew his support from the municipalities and part of the nobility, most notably the Galician Castro family headed by Fernando Rodrigues de Castro, Pertegueiro Maior of Santiago and Adelantado Mayor of Galicia, who, after defecting from Henry's side in 1355, was playing the same role as the Traba family two hundred years before. Other notable supporters were Sueiro Eans Parada, Men Rodrigues de Seabra, and the Moscoso family. In 1366 Pedro was forced to flee into Andalusia, while Fernando de Castro returned to Galicia. After a dangerous journey through Portugal, King Pedro made it to Galicia, where an assembly of supporters decided to send him into Gascony to seek English support,Garcia Oro 1987, vol. I, 104. whilst at the same time internal enemies such as the archbishop of Compostela were assassinated or prosecuted.L√≥pez Carreira 1999, 291. This same year, with Pedro abroad, a temporary truce permitted Henry to surface in Galicia, where he obtained the support of some important aristocrats, most notably Fernan Peres de Andrade.Garcia Oro 1987, vol. I, 105‚Äì106. In 1367, counting on the additional support of the archers of the English prince Edward of Woodstock, Peter won the battle of Najera, which allowed him to take the war into Andalusia. However, the entry of England's enemy Charles V of France on Henry's side had a destabilising effect. In 1369 the new archbishop of Santiago, the loyalist Rodrigo de Moscoso, urgently ordered his knights to march to Andalusia and support the King and Fernando de Castro, but the call was ignored.It's precise that you come immediately and as fast as you can (¬´Compre que ve√±ades logo et o mais a presa que poderdes¬ª). Garcia Oro 1987, vol. I, 106‚Äì107. The capture of Peter during the Battle of Montiel and his subsequent murder left Henry II in control of the Crown of Castile. ===Ferdinand I of Portugal king in Galicia=== Ferdinand I of Portugal The triumph of the high nobility in Castile,L√≥pez Carreira 2005, 406. as represented by the death of Peter I and crowning of their candidate, Henry II, was resented by the majority of Galician nobles, who had been forgiven by the new King.Garcia Oro 1987, vol. I, 107‚Äì108. Under the leadership of Fernando de Castro, the Galician loyalist party and the cities,Tui, A Coru√±a, Lugo and Santiago most notably. Cf. Garcia Oro, vol. I, 108. invited Ferdinand I of Portugal to be their king, assuring him that the Galician nobles and citizens would \\"raise their voices for him ... and they hand him the cities and recognize as lord and will honor him\\".Fern√£o Lopes, Cr√≥nica, ed. 1966, p. 75. In his triumphant entrance Ferdinand was accompanied by many aristocratic Galician supporters, including Fernando de Castro, Count of Trastamara; Alvar Peres de Castro, the lord of Salvaterra; and Nuno Freire de Andrade, Master of the Portuguese Order of Christ. He was acclaimed in the cities and towns:Fern√£o Lopes, Cr√≥nica, ed. 1966, p.86 \\"os da villa o sairom todos a re√ßeber\\". Tui, Redondela, Ribadavia, Ourense, Lugo, Padr√≥n, Compostela, and finally A Coru√±a,L√≥pez Carreira 1999, 292. which was given to the king by its keeper, Joan Fernandes de Andeiro. During his brief government in Galicia, Ferdinand I set about restoring the Galician strongholds, including Tui and Baiona, and liberalized trade between Galicia and Portugal, supplying grain and wine by sea to the war-weakened Galician populace.Fern√£o Lopes, Cr√≥nica, ed. 966, p. 87. \\"Carregar em Lisboa navios e cevada e vinhos, que levassem todo a aquelle logar para seer bastecido\\". He also made provisions for the issuance of gold and silver coinage at Tui and A Coru√±aOn the abundant Portuguese coinage of the mints of A Coru√±a, Tui and Milmanda: to be recognized as valid throughout Galicia and Portugal. Despite these measures, the presence of the Portuguese monarch was short-lived. Henry II of Castile, with the support of the mercenaries of Du Guesclin, launched an offensive that forced Ferdinand I back to Portugal. Later, in 1371, with the Portuguese troops defending themselves from Henry's mercenaries, Fernando de Castro and his fellow nobles were defeated in the battle of Porto de Bois, near Lugo, by Henry's men: Pedro Manrique, governor of Castile, and Pedro Rois Sarmento.Garcia Oro 1987, vol. I, 109. Fernando de Castro fled to Portugal, but was later banished to Gascony under the terms of the Treaty of Santar√©m, which forced Portugal to expel many of the Galician supporters of Fernando I, dying there in 1377. In 1372, after Henry had defeated Men Rodrigues de Seabra, Castilian rule was re-established over most of Galicia, although A Coru√±a, regularly supplied by Portuguese ships, held out until 1373.Garcia Oro 1987, vol. I, 109; L√≥pez Carreira 2005, 406‚Äì411; L√≥pez Carreira 1999, 293. ===John of Gaunt=== John of Gaunt entering Santiago de Compostela, from a manuscript of Jean Froissart's chronicles John of Gaunt The expulsion of Ferdinand I of Portugal and the abandonment of his claim to Galicia was followed a year later by the capture of Tui by Diego Sarmento on behalf of Henry II. However, the town of Coru√±a remained faithful to Portugal until 1373, whilst Jo√£o Fernandes de Andeiro, exiled in England, entered negotiations for further support for the loyalist Galician party, at the same time laying the foundation of the secular alliance between England and Portugal.Garcia Oro 1987, vol. I, 110‚Äì111. On July 10, 1372 a treaty was signed by which Constance, daughter of Peter I, claimed the legitimate right to succeed her father. Her husband, John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster and son of King Edward III of England, then claimed the Castilian Crown on her behalf.L√≥pez Carreira 1999, 293. John's first attempt to make good on this claim failed when his troops were diverted to Poitou to participate in the clashes against France as part of the Hundred Years' War. On July 25, 1386, with the support of a papal bull of Urban IV confirming his right to the Crown of Castile, he landed in Coru√±a with some 1500 archers, 1500 lancers and some 4000 other supporters, without fighting or attacking the city.\\"The grand master Davis had news few days ago of how the Duke of Lancaster had arrived with ships and militarymen at the town of Coru√±a in Galicia, the day of St. James, and how he took some ships of the king of Castile, and the military-men were 1500 lances and alike number of archers and all of them were good. And he brought with him his wife Constance, who was the daughter of king Peter and a daughter who had been born of her, who was called Catherine, and he brought other two daughters who the Duke had of another woman he married before, who was daughter of another Duke of Lancaster and Earl of Derby, the elder was called Philippa, who married the grand master of Davis, who was called king of Portugal, as further on we tell, and the other daughter was called Elisabeth, who married then a knight who come with the Duke, who was called John of Holland, who was son of the princess and Thomas of Holland, because the Duke of Lancaster made him his military chief.\\" Ayala's Chronicles (J. L. Mart√≠n ed. 1991: 607). Following negotiations it was agreed that the city would open its gates once the Duke was received in Santiago de Compostela; being admitted there, John's troops, assisted by Galician exiles, took control of Pontevedra, Vigo, Baiona and Betanzos without a fight, whilst John himself proceeded to Ourense, defended by Breton troops in the service of John I of Castile. Meanwhile, the port of Ferrol was taken by John's ally the Portuguese king John I of Portugal, and the town of Ribadavia‚Äîwhere the local Jews, most of them of Leonese extraction, apparently presented a fierce defence‚Äîwas assaulted after a siege by troops commanded by Thomas Percy.L√≥pez Carreira 2005, 412‚Äì413. With the capture of Ferrol, the Duke controlled the whole Kingdom of Galicia, as reported in the chronicles of Jean Froissart: ¬´avoient mis en leur obeissance tout le roiaulme de Gallice¬ª.Froissart Chronique, t. 12, p.214. John was unable to capitalize on this initial success, as plague decimated the English army in Galicia during 1386 and 1387. Later, in 1387, together with the Portuguese, he launched an unsuccessful assault into the dry terrain of Castile; finally, John was forced to negotiate with John I of Castile. In their 1388 peace treaty, the Duke of Lancaster and Constance of Castile renounced their claims to Castile in exchange for monetary compensation and a marriage alliance between their daughter and the son and heir of Henry II, the future Henry III of Castile.L√≥pez Carreira 2005, 413. The withdrawal of the English armies brought an end to Galicia's attempts, spearheaded by its nobles and town councils, to secede from the Crown of Castile. ===The 15th century=== Castle of the House of Andrade, A Nogueirosa, Pontedeume After the defeat of the loyalist party, with their leaders consequently exiled in Portugal or dead abroad, Henry II and John I introduced a series of foreign noble houses in Galicia as tenants of important fiefs. For example, the County of Trast√°mara, ancient dominion of the Traba and Castro houses, was given first to Pedro En√≠quez de Castro, nephew of Henry II;Garcia Oro 1987, vol. I, 265. later, in 1440, it was divided into two counties, Trastamara and Lemos, and given to the Osorios, of the frontier lands of Bierzo.‚ÄúPont Ferrat, fin d'Espage, commecemnt de Galice‚Äù (Itinerary of Senlis, c.15th century). Cf. L√≥pez Carreira 2005, 418. In the South some important concessions were given to the Sarmento family, which, in time, would hold the job of Adelantado Mayor of the Kingdom of Galicia as a family legacy; and to the Pimentels of Benavente.Garcia Oro 1987, vol. I, 265‚Äì267. Some of these families, most notably the Osorios, would become during the 16th and 17th centuries the most influential defenders of Galician causes. But during the 15th century, in the absence of solid leadership, such as exercised in the past by the archbishop of Santiago or by the Counts of Trast√°mara, the Kingdom of Galicia was reduced to a set of semi-independent and rival fiefdoms,L√≥pez Carreira 2005, 417. militarily important, but with little political influence abroad. The 15th century was characterized by the rapacity of these and other local noble houses (among others, the Moscosos in western Galicia, the Andrades in the North, the Soutomaiors and the Estradas in the South and West, and the Ulloas in central Galicia)Garcia Oro 1987, vol. I, 116 and 267‚Äì269. each one directed by the heir of the lineage, not unusually a woman. The houses, and their minor knights and squires, tried to acquire every type of economic and jurisdictional title (usually as encomendeiros, that is, protectors) over towns and cities, monasteries, bishoprics, and even over royal properties, towns and territories. Castles and mottes were used all over Galicia to hold and keep the noblemen's armies, and as raiding outposts. The noblemen frequently fought each other for the possession of these strongholds. { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 87%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:23em; max-width: 25%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  We obey that letters (...) but regarding the fulfillment of what we are asked, we say that what these letters demand of us is very burdensome, and it would be impossible for us to accomplish it (...)

For in this Kingdom there is an archbishopric, four bishoprics, and other towns and places of our lord the Prince, and of three Counties, and of many other great knights; and it would be very accomplishing and very necessary for the King and for this Kingdom to invoke its deputies. Letter of the City Council of Ourense to the King, 1454. } Similar conflicts were frequent between the city councils and the Church, even occasioning the deaths of the bishop of Lugo in 1403 and the bishop of Ourense in 1419.L√≥pez Carreira 1999, 296‚Äì297. All these wars, together with rampant banditry, created a climate of violence and insecurity throughout Galicia.The Bohemian nobleman Baron Le√≥n Rosmithal, in his pilgrimage to Santiago in 1466, was a witness of these conflict-ridden times, when first he and his retinue were confronted by a group of some 100 peasants, armed with spears, swords and crossbows, after a boy had accidentally hit with a stone a passerby; whilst later he found the City of Santiago raised on arms against the bishop, who was a prisoner inside the Cathedral. Cf. 84-7154-909-3, pp. 32‚Äì40. The remoteness of the King was partly to blame: during the 15th century no monarch ever come to visit Galicia, except for the Catholic Monarchs in 1486.Barros Guimer√°ns 1988, 41. This absence on the one hand transformed the King into a remote ideal of Justice, whilst on the other affirmed the sensation of impunity and defencelessness among the inhabitants of the Kingdom.Cf. Barros Guimer√°ns 1988, 39‚Äì47. The remoteness of the monarch also resulted in Galicia losing its vote in the Cortes (Parliament) sometime during the late 14th or early 15th centuries. In 1423, in the absence of the Galician cities, the city of Zamora (located in Le√≥n, but historically linked to Galicia) asked to be treated as the capital of the Kingdom of Galicia, which was granted, with their deputies sitting next to the monarch at his right. Zamora represented the Kingdom of Galicia in the Cortes until 1640, usually against the will and the advice of the Galician cities. Under these difficult circumstances, with constant wars and a broken judicial system, the cities of Galicia, which progressively acquired a leading role during this century, engaged in a tax revolt between 1430 and 1460.Barros Guimer√°ns 1994, 84‚Äì85. They refused to pay certain taxes to John II and Henry IV, citing the many and onerous services the Kingdom rendered to the King; the lack of effective law enforcement, which had led to the economic destruction of the Kingdom;Due to the decline of thy justice and thou not having remedied this (...) thou have a great burden in thy conscience; Barros Guimer√°ns 1994, 88. and the absence of Galician deputies in the Parliament.In a letter to the King, the Council of Ourense accused the Kingdoms of Le√≥n and of Castile of acting unfairly, charging on Galicia part of their own taxes, taking advantage on the absence of Galician deputies. Cf. L√≥pez Carreira 2005, 420. ===Irmandinos Wars=== 14th century 'Retablo de Belvis' The castle of Pambre, Palas de Rei, which resisted the Irmandi√±os troops Castle of Soutomaior During the 15th century, a time of social and economic crisis in Europe, a series of insurrections roiled the Kingdom, the result the brutal behavior of the bishops and the noblemen toward the churchmen, artisans and peasants. The insurgents were generally organized in irmandades ('brotherhoods'), groups of men who, in exceptional circumstances, and allegedly with the king's approval, armed themselves to act as policemen in defence of peace and justice. One of these brotherhoods, established in Compostela in 1418, took advantage of the temporary absence of the archbishop, and violently overthrew the city council in 1422. Another one, called Fusquenlla or 'The Mad Brotherhood', rose up in the north of the kingdom against the House of Andrade. The armies of the brotherhood, directed by the lesser nobleman Roi Xordo, were finally defeated by the Andrades' armies by the gates of Compostela in 1431. Later, in 1453, the troops of the bishop of Ourense and that of the council of the city fought fiercely for the possession of the local castles, even using tronos (cannons; lit., 'thunders'), and forcing the bishop into exile.L√≥pez Carreira 1999, 299‚Äì302. In 1458 a brotherhood was established among some important noblemen (the House of Moscoso, the House of Estrada, and Sueiro Gomes de Soutomaior among others) and the cities and towns of Compostela, Noia, and Muros, against the archbishop of Santiago, who was taken prisoner, kept and paraded in a cage for two years, and then banished for ten years after his supporters paid a large ransom. Similar revolts were occurring all over the kingdom, in Betanzos, Viveiro, Lugo and Allariz. All of these Galician brotherhoods acted autonomously, sometimes even against King's will and direct orders.Barros Guimer√°ns 1988, 39‚Äì45. In 1465 the Crown of Castile was again in crisis, with King Henry IV under siege by Castilian noblemen who were supporting an aristocratic candidate to the throne. Henry sent letters all around the realm, calling for the establishment of brotherhoods to defend the status quo. From 1465 to 1467 local brotherhoods were organized all over Galicia, gaining the allegiance of churchmen, artisans, peasants, and some noblemen.Barros Guimer√°ns 1988, 94. In the spring of 1467 a General Council of the Kingdom of Galicia (Junta General do Reyno de Galizia) was held in Melide. After an angry debate it was decided that noblemen should deliver all of their strongholds and castles to the officials of the Irmandade, resulting in the flight of many lesser nobles, while others resisted the armies of the Irmandi√±os ('little brothers'), only to be slowly beaten back into Castile and Portugal; as described by a contemporary, 'the sparrows pursued the falcons'.Garcia Oro, vol. I, 314. For the rest of the year the armies of the Brotherhood marched all over Galicia, fighting the lords and demolishing tens of strongholds. From 1467 to 1469 the Kingdom of Galicia was governed by the Irmandade, directed by the city dwellers, whilst its armies‚Äîcomposed mostly of armed peasants‚Äîwere commanded by sympathizing noblemen, as the veteran soldiers they were. General Councils of the Kingdom were later held in Betanzos and Santiago de Compostela in 1467, in Lugo in 1468, and in Ourense in 1469. But in autumn of 1469 the exiled noblemen, joining forces, marched into Galicia: Pedro Alvares de Soutomaior entered from Portugal with gunmen and mercenaries; the archbishop Fonseca of Compostela from Zamora; and the Count of Lemos from Ponferrada. Meanwhile, other noblemen who had resisted inside the Kingdom also pushed forward. In 1469 and 1470 the Irmandi√±o armies were defeated all over the Country, except in some well defended cities such as A Coru√±a.L√≥pez Carreira 1999, 306; and Garcia Oro, vol. I, 314. In 1470, after the defeat of the Brotherhood, the noblemen, regaining their states and granting themselves sonorous titlesMany of the noblemen acquired titles such as Viscount of Tui, Marshal of Baiona, Count of Altamira, Count of Monterrei. One notable exception was the Lord of Andrade, who refused to acquire a title for himself, declaring that 'he either would prefer to be a good knight, than a bad count'. Cf. ordered the reconstructions of a number of strongholds, usually using the rebels as labour force. This same year, the noblemen assigned a pact of mutual assistance, signaling the beginning of a long war against the archbishop of Santiago--among which were Pedro Alvarez de Soutomaior, called Pedro Madruga,Meaning who get up early, because of his capacity to draw ahead of his enemies. designated as leader of the nobility.Garcia Oro, vol. I, 315‚Äì319. The situation of the Kingdom of Galicia in 1473 is described by a nobleman in his last will: ===Catholic Monarchs=== A Mariscala, the chain which allegedly kept prisoner Marshal Pardo de Cela before his execution.

Isabella had married her cousin, Fernando II of Aragon, and was supported by the Aragonese and Catalans, while Joanna married the king of Portugal, Afonso V, thereby obtaining his country's support. In Galicia, Archbishop Fonseca sided with Isabella, while Pedro √Ålvarez de Soutomaior, who had large interests in Portugal and in southern Galicia, sided with Joanna, and was accordingly rewarded by the king of Portugal with the title of Count of Caminha. Notwithstanding, most noblemen behaved cautiously, waiting to join the winner's side.Garcia Oro 1987, vol. I, p. 319. In October 1476 Fonseca unsuccessfully attacked the well-defended city of Pontevedra, held by Pedro Madruga, with an army composed of 200 lancers and 5000 infantrymen, while a Basque navy commanded by Ladr√≥n de Guevara took Baiona and assaulted Viveiro; but Pedro's tenacity resulted in a draw.Garcia Oro 1987, vol. I, p. 323-330. In 1479, the armies of Fonseca moved south again against Pedro Madruga, and, after a series of battles, forced the Count of Caminha into Portugal, although Tui, Salvaterra de Mi√±o and other towns and strongholds were still held by his people and their Portuguese allies. In 1480, a peace treaty recognised Isabella and Fernando, the Catholic Monarchs, as queen and king. Under the terms of the peace treaty with Portugal and Juana, all the enemies of Isabel, including Pedro Madruga, were granted pardons. This same year, and against the advice of the Galician nobility,Garcia Oro 1987, vol. I, p. 331-333. the Catholic monarchs sent a Castilian police and military corps, the Santa Hermandad, to Galicia. It was soon criticised not only as an institution composed mostly of foreigners,Garcia Oro 1987, vol. I, p. 335-336. but also as a heavy burden on the local economy, costing more than 6 million maravedi per year‚Äî-by comparison, the budget of Columbus' first journey to America was just 2 million maravedi-‚Äîbut also due to its arbitrariness and rudeness with the local inhabitants.Cf. Garcia Oro 1987, vol. I, p. 337-340, who also narrates some episodes of cruelty and mass punishment. This corps, reinforced with mercenary troops and under the pretension of pacifying the country and getting rid of adventurers and thieves, was also used as field army at the service of the policies of the monarchs.Garcia Oro 1987, vol. I, p. 335. As personal representatives, the Catholic Monarchs also sent a new plenipotentiary Governor of the Kingdom of Galicia‚Äîan office first established in 1475‚Äîand a Justi√ßia Mayor (Attorney general), together with a series of other officials and collection agents. They also appointed royal aldermen in some of the cities and towns.Garcia Oro 1987, vol. I, p. 289-309. From 1480 to 1485, the Santa Hermandad and the new official, endorsed by local supporters, worked jointly in harassing the largely-rebelliousGarcia Oro 1987, vol.

I, p. 334-335 However, the resistance was ended with the death of its leader, the Count of Lemos, and the wars against Marshal Pardo de Cela and Count Pedro Madruga concluded around the same time; de Cela was beheaded in Mondo√±edo in 1483, whilst Pedro was deposed in 1485 by his own son, √Ålvaro--a desperate attempt to save the lineage of Soutomaior.Garcia Oro 1987, vol. I, p. 353. The establishment in 1500 of the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia (a permanent royal tribunal), and later the forced reformation and submission of the Galician monasteries to the Castilian ones, represented the integration de facto of the Kingdom of Galicia under the Crown of Castile.L√≥pez Carreira 2005, 426. ==Modern age== Charles V, also king of Galicia, by Joannes and Lucas Doetecum ===The Junta or General Assembly of the Kingdom=== The Junta, Junta General, Juntas, or Cortes of the Kingdom of Galicia was the representative assembly of the Kingdom from the 15th century, when it originated as a general assembly of all the powers of Galicia aimed at the constitution of hermandades (brotherhood), and until 1834, when the Kingdom and its General Assembly were officially disbanded by a Royal decree. Initially the Juntas Generales was an assembly where representatives of the three states of the Kingdom (noblemen, churchmen, and the commoners) met, but it soon followed the evolution prompted by the King in other representative institutions, such as the Cortes of Castile, becoming the assembly monopolized by the bourgeoisie and lesser nobility (fidalgos), who controlled most of the local councils of the cities and towns of the Kingdom, and at the expenses of Church and nobility. From 1599 the composition of the assembly became fixed and reduced to just seven deputies, each one representing one of the Kingdom's provinces, and appointed by the local council of the province's capital ‚ÄîSantiago de Compostela, A Coru√±a, Betanzos, Lugo, Mondo√±edo, Ourense, and Tui‚Äî from among its members. Other towns, namely Viveiro and Pontevedra, tried during the 17th and 18th centuries to regain their seats in the assembly, to no effect. The Junta had no direct role in law making, and was permitted little control in the Royal administration,Only occasionally the King permitted the deputies to supervise the labour of the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia, or other King's officials. Cf. . but it could nevertheless rise armies, ships and taxes, conceding or denying the King's petitions on behalf of the local powers of the Kingdom, and it could also petition the King directly, being recognized as the voice and representative of the Kingdom and the depositary of its will, traditions and rights (foros). Notwithstanding, the King never consented on the petition of the assembly to meet at will, and from 1637 he decreed that the meetings of the assembly could only take place when in presence of a representative of the monarch, with voice, usually the Governor-Captain General of the Kingdom, in an attempt to maintain a tighter grip on the institution and its agreements. As a reaction of the abdication of King Ferdinand VII in favour of Napoleon, the Junta declared itself the sovereign and supreme authority of the Kingdom on June 18, 1808, during the Peninsular war, thereby becoming the legitimate and de facto government of the Kingdom until Galicia was conquered by Napoleon in 1809. In an effort to broaden its representation, it briefly admitted churchmen (viz., the bishop of Ourense) and titled nobility. ===Policies of Philip II (1556‚Äì1598)=== Philip II of Habsburg saw a deep economic and social crisis, and was disastrous for its cultural development; portrait by Alonso Sanchez Coello In 1556, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, abdicated the throne and divided his realm between his brother Ferdinand I of Habsburg, and his son Philip II. In practice this resulted in the disappearance of the European empire of the Habsburgs and the idea of a universal Catholic monarchy. Ferdinand was declared Holy Roman Emperor and king of Hungary and Bohemia, while Philip inherited the Netherlands, Naples and Sicily, the Crown of Aragon and Castile, including the Kingdom of Galicia. The 42-year reign of Philip II was characterized from the beginning by wars of expansion‚Äîagainst the Netherlands, France, England, Portugal and the Ottoman Empire. Stretching across the Atlantic and northern Europe these wars had disastrous consequences for Galicia's society and economy. Battle between the naval fleets of Philip II of Habsburg (nicknamed the \\"Invincible Armada\\") and Elizabeth I of England in 1588, leaving the English victorious With his private crusade against the Lutherans, the Catholic monarch prevented the participation of the Kingdom of Galicia in the three most important revolutionary processes of the age: the Reformation, the opening up of the New World, and the Scientific revolution. In 1562, Philip II deployed the Holy Office, via the Spanish Inquisition, in the Kingdom of Galicia, after the failure of Charles V's attempts to do so due to the opposition of the Galician clergy. The Inquisition was an instrument of cultural and religious repression without precedent, which began operating in Portugal from 1575, led by the Castilian Inquisitor Quijano del Mercado. The Inquisition's stated aim was to prevent the \\"contamination\\" of the Kingdom of Galicia by the reformist ideas of the Lutherans, which arrived in Galicia via English, Dutch and French traders. This situation also had serious commercial consequences, as merchant ships could not dock without the Inquisition's approval, and sailors believed to be heretics could be burned at the stake. The Inquisition even went as far as proposing the closure of all Galician seaports to avoid religious contamination. Such measures eventually exceeded the patience of the inhabitants of cities like A Coru√±a, which requested the end of inquisitorial activity at the seaport in 1589 due to the effect on maritime traffic. { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 87%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:23em; max-width: 25%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  \\"Rodrigo Montero, cleric, priest and rector of the Fort of San Felipe ... declared that ... the armies of the King our Lord (Philip II), have stayed here in winter and summer in the seaport town of Ferrol ... have done great harms to the residents of the town of Ferrol ... as they (the Spanish troops) took the houses where Ferrol people lived and the troops forced them to leave it and look for others ... troops have removed and cut the vines and breaking civilian's walls ... also razed and felled the forests and wood in people's forests ... took by force the boats to the inhabitants of the said town of Ferrol and the troops forced them to recruit and work for them without payment ... these services didn't allow the Ferrol's men go fishing and feed their wives and children and ... the troops also ate and destroyed the fruits of their trees and cabbages, vegetables and turnips and more lelgumbres of their orchards ... stole them also wood tabals from the civilians houses got repairing their vessels and the benefit of the said vessels ... - (Rodrigo Montero, September 2, 1603) } Philip II's reign saw the continuation of the expulsion of the Jews begun on May 30, 1492, linguistic persecution (from 1566 the adoption of Castilian was enforced, and the use of Arabic was punished by the Crown), and religious persecutions effectively constituted ethnic cleansing. For example, in Alpujarra in the Kingdom of Granada in 1568, led by self-proclaimed king Muhammad ibn Umayya, Philip ordered the forced dispersal of 80,000 Granadian Muslims throughout the realm, and the introduction of Christians in their place. Thousands of Galician families were sent to Granada for that purpose between the years 1572‚Äì77, with many of them dying in the process. Although Spain generally militarized in order to conduct its war against the Netherlands--used primarily to garner support for the Crown-- Galicia was left relatively undefended, a result of the prior dismantling of the Galician strongholds. Thus, in 1580 the Board of the Kingdom of Galicia requested troops from Philip in order to defend the coast, just months after a recruitment drive had taken place. However, although Phillip assented, these troops were not used to protect Galicia, but instead to attack Portugal, in an attempt to add it to Phillip's empire. Despite claims to the contrary, the military campaign against Portugal was not carried out by professional soldiers billeted at A Coru√±a, Ferrol, or Baiona, and was not paid for by the crown, but was rather conducted by ill-equipped peasant troops, and paid for by Galician nobles such as Pedro Fernandes de Castro II, the Count of Monterrei, Gaspar de Z√∫√±iga e Azevedo, and others. The war against England (1585‚Äì1604), motivated by the traditional English support of Portugal and Holland, also had disastrous consequences for the Kingdom of Galicia. This was due to both the disruption of trade relations with northern Europe, which since the Middle Ages had provided enormous wealth to the kingdom, and to England's constant operations in the region, staged in order to end Phillip's maritime expeditions, such as the Spanish Armada in 1588. The outcome of all this was the complete ruin of Galician villages such as Ferrol, where the civilians were driven from their homes by Philip's soldiers, who seized all their crops and property, and drove the fishermen into forced labor. Towns like A Coru√±a also suffered constant attacks by the English fleet, such as that led by Francis Drake in 1589, with the cities being protected by civilian troops and folk heroes, such as Mar√≠a Pita. ===The last Habsburgs (1598‚Äì1700)=== The Kingdom of Galicia in 1603 The death of Philip II in 1598 failed to effect a dramatic improvement in Galicia's fortunes. Although the reign of Philip III of Spain (1598‚Äì1621) was marked by a more conciliatory foreign policy and was more peaceful than that of his father, throughout the rest of the 17th century (viz., the reigns of Philip IV and Charles II) witnessed a series of wars between the Habsburgs and Holland, England, France and especially Portugal, which collectively had a remarkable social and economic impact in Galicia. Thus, while conflicts against the Ottomans resulted in a devastating battle in the Rias Baixas in 1617, the unpopular war against Portugal (1640‚Äì1668) and the decades-long war against the Netherlands, both took a heavy toll on Galician peasants, sent to various fronts from the Atlantic seaports. Fray Felipe de la Gandara, official chronicler of the kingdom of Galicia, complained that during 25 years (1624-1659), \\"the kingdom of Galicia has served for now during the glorious reign of His Majesty [Philip IV] until the year 1659 with more than 68,000 men and 18,001,000 ducats\\". The war also affected the Galician economy. Trade was paralysed, as Galicia's traditional commercial partners were now enemy powers: England, France, Flanders, and its main customer, Portugal, whose border had been closed for over three decades. The provisions of the Spanish monarchs against trading timber in the kingdom also deepened the crisis. With the imposition a new (and controversial) administrative figure, the juez de plant√≠os y dehesas (\\"judge of forests and plantings\\"), the Castilian Council reclaimed its rights to the Galician forests for the construction of warships. This led to the perverse situation of locals being arrested for collecting firewood to heat their houses, leading in turn to resentment against the Galician junta. ===Restoration of voting at the Council of Castile (1623)=== Diego Sarmiento de Acu√±a, count of Gondomar, was one of the main advocates of voting rights at the Council of Castile. A humanist ambassador and lover of the Galician language and culture, he was respected and appreciated in the kingdom and abroad; c. 17th century Since the reign of King John II of Castile, the kingdom of Galicia was no longer on the Crown Council, and from about 1476 Zamora in Le√≥n acted on behalf of Galicia in the assembly. However, in 1518 the Galician cities and towns began to demand their legitimate positions in the Council of Castile, and to protest the Zamoran leaders speaking for them. The recovery of their voting rights at the Council of Castile was a goal shared by the Galician aristocracy and oligarchs. In 1520 the Archbishop of Santiago, Afonso III da Fonseca, and the Counts of Benavente and Andrade complained about it during a celebration of the Castilian Council in the Galician capital, Compostela, but to no avail. These elites organized an assembly, headed by Alfonso and consisting of nobles and prelates, in the town of Melide in central Galicia on December 4, 1520. They sent a new demand to Emperor Charles V on the subject of the vote, but he again refused to give Galicia an independent voice. { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 87%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:23em; max-width: 25%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Quando eu non tibera a obriga√ßon que o mundo save pola nobre√ßa que en Vmd co√±e√ßo o fijera A esos meus se√±ores seus fillos de Vmd e primos meus ueyjo infinitas ue√ßes as mans e deus os faga en to do seus fillos de Vmd e de mi√±a se√±ora Dona Costan√ßa.

Sent to Diego Sarmiento de Acu√±a, this letter is one of the few witnesses in Galician language during the 17th century. } A year after the emperor's refusal, the Galician city councils tried another tack, resulting in a 1557 proposal to offer 20,000 ducats in exchange for restoring Galicia's vote in the Castilian Council. This proposal was put to successive meetings of the Galician assembly, until in 1599 the assembly accepted it and agreed to take the lead on negotiations. Two delegations were chosen to go to Madrid, but the new offer was rejected like the rest. However, in 1621, circumstances turned in favor of Galicia. The Empire needed the political and financial cooperation of its kingdoms in order to wage another war, following the end of a twelve-year truce. The oligarchy and the Galician city councils were able to seize this opportunity, and, despite the resistance of Zamora and other cities with exclusionary voting at the Courts, the Crown bowed to military necessity, and in 1623 the kingdom of Galicia regained its Council vote, dependent upon paying 100,000 ducats to build a navy to defend its own coastline. The influence of Diego Sarmiento de Acu√±a, Count Gondomar, was crucial to the success of this effort, and Philip IV signed the resolution on October 13, 1623. ===The establishment of the Bourbons (18th century)=== In 1700, Charles II of Habsburg died without an heir. This caused a war between those who supported the French Philip V of Bourbon as the successor (mainly the crown of Castile and France) and those who supported the Austrian Archduke Charles VI of Habsburg (the Crown of Aragon, England and Holland among others). In fact the struggle between these two suitors was also basically a struggle between two political conceptions: on the one hand the absolutist centralism of Philip V, and on the other the federalism of Charles VI of Habsburg. In the ensuing war (1701‚Äì1714) between the crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon, the kingdom of Galicia could not avail itself of an independent policy due to being controlled strongly since 1486 by Castile, and Galicia was forced to provide military support to the suitor supported by the Castilian Crown, Philip V of Bourbon, who eventually won the war. The political result of this war was the establishment of a monarchy based in Castile, from where it attempted to impose uniform governance on the region. The culmination of this policy was the \\"Nueva Planta Decrees\\" (1707‚Äì1716), designed to punish the Crown of Aragon by eliminating its political bodies and imposing an Audiencia similar to that in Galicia 200 years before. Once the old crowns -Castile and Aragon- were dissolved in 1715, the \\"Crown of Spain\\", governed solely by the Castilian government--notably by the Council of Castile--replaced them. In addition, the Bourbons established a \\"provincial Intendance\\" on their territories according to the French model, including the kingdom of Galicia, under the command of a General Captain. There was also a firm Bourbon policy aimed at standardizing culture and language within their Spanish territories. Explicit and stringent laws were designed to end linguistic diversity in Bourbon territories with non-Castilian native languages: Finally, I command that the teaching of the first letters, Latin and rhetoric will only in Castilian language, taking care this compliance the Audiencias and the respective Courts. May 23, 1768.

Mart√≠n Sarmiento. } The Age of Enlightenment arose during the 18th century in Europe, representing new interests in empirical ideas, in philosophy, political economy, and sciences such as physics, chemistry, and biology. Thus began a renewal of interest in the historical personality, as well as the cultural and economic diversity, of the Kingdom of Galicia, attributable to important local writers who knew Galicia as a distinct polity with particular needs. Portrait of Mart√≠n Sarmiento In the vast task of modernizing the kingdom to best leverage its human and natural resources, Galician societies and academies played a prominent role, such as the Academy of Agriculture of the Kingdom of Galicia (inaugurated on January 20, 1765), The Economic Society of Friends of the Kingdom of Galicia (February 15, 1784), and the Societies of Friends of the Country to Santiago de Compostela (1784) and Lugo (1785), as well as ambitious proposals such as the Royal Fishermen's Pawnshop of the Kingdom of Galicia (1775). The Enlightenment writers were the first to denounce the Kingdom's contemporary problems, most of them arising from the harmful policies of the Catholic Monarchs and the Habsburgs. These writers began reporting on the state of roads, the unnecessary imports, the mass emigration, the linguistic acculturation polities, and the economic marginalization of the kingdom. Due to their demands, they achieved, inter alia, the constitution of a Maritime and Land Consulate in A Coru√±a, allowing Galicia to trade with the American colonies. Two ecclesiastics, Benito Jer√≥nimo Feij√≥o y Montenegro and Mart√≠n Sarmiento, stood out for their enormous contributions to the language and culture of the kingdom. Montenegro was the first to denounce the misery of the Galician peasants, proposing changes in the administration of the kingdom. Sarmiento, with extensive knowledge of botany and natural medicines, devoted himself to philology; and was a great defender of the Galician language, composing the Catalogue of voices and phrases of the Galician language (1745‚Äì1755). Economic themes were highlighted by other Galician aristocrats, such as Joseph Cornide Saavedra, Pedro Antonio S√°nchez, and Lucas Labrada, as well as ecclesiastics like Francisco de Castro, and merchants like Antonio Raimundo Ib√°√±ez. They were all authors of many works of vital importance to economic development, such as the Report on sardine fishing off the coast of Galicia (1774), and the Economic description of the Kingdom of Galicia (1804). ===19th century=== The Kingdom of Galicia and the Junta continued to formally exist until the State Liberal Reform of 1833, at the time of the provincial division under the regency of Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies. Galicia regained its territorial unity for twenty-four days by the constitution of the Junta de Gobierno de Galicia following a liberal armed uprising in 1846, the M√°rtires de Carral, but never regained the status of a kingdom. ==Culture== Due to myths surrounding Galicia's history (especially during the era of the kingdom), the Kingdom has been referred to as \\"Terra Meiga\\" (land of the witches) or \\"Reino Meiga\\" (kingdom of the witches).https://santiagoways.com/en/myths-and-legends-of-the- camino-de-santiago/ ==Symbols of the kingdom== Romanesque miniature representing Alfonso IX, King of Le√≥n. In the upper part appears his historic title Rex Legionensium et Gallecie, while the lower part shows the purple lion, symbol of the Leonese monarchy ===The purple lion=== The custom of painting symbols, such as the heraldic shields of war, was forged in the battlefields of Europe after the middle decades of the 12th century, due to a confluence of different circumstances. One was the need to differentiate between allies and adversaries on the battlefield, as facial protection in medieval helmets tended to obscure the combatants' faces, but also due to the high ornamental value of decorated shields with bright, crisp, and alternate shapes in the context of chivalrous society. The first heraldic signs were used by kings as personal marks to identify themselves. Shortly after, they began to be shared by the upper social levels close to the royalty, and finally were used to represent the territory in which they exercised their jurisdiction, the kingdom. One of the first kings in Europe to make use of a heraldic emblem was the Leonese king, Alphonse VII. At the beginning of the 12th century he began timidly using a purple lion in accordance with its ancient symbolism, as Leo Fortis, the \\"strong lion\\", symbolized power and primacy of the monarch, but would also have represented a punning reference to the name of his kingdom, Le√≥n. The emblem was developed with his son Ferdinand II, and was finally established by Alphonse IX. ===The Chalice, symbol of the kingdom=== Parallel to the process of development and consolidation of European royal emblems from the late 13th century, collections of them, the Armorials, displayed lists of kingdoms and their royal symbols. In the case of Galicia, the prominence which the Kingdom had had for centuries saw it included in the early European armorials. However, the absence of an exclusive symbol for Galician kings, who were also kings of Le√≥n since the 12th century, forced the medieval heraldists to use Canting arms, a symbol derived from the phonetics of the name. An English armorial named Segar's Roll, produced in 1282, was the first Armorial which assigned the chalice as the Coat of Arms for the King and Kingdom of Galicia (Roy de Galice), probably coming directly from the Anglo-Norman word for Galicia, Galyce, which was very close to the word Calice (chalice). Following that time, different European armorials began to use the chalice as the emblem of the Kingdom of Galicia. In the mid-15th century, this symbol came to Galicia, where it was easily and readily accepted, as the Holy Grail was already a symbol widely spread over Europe and already present in Galician history and its deepest beliefs. Thereafter, the purple lion of the former Galician-Leonese monarchy lost its representative character in favor of the better known canting arms, being then adopted exclusively by the Kingdom of Le√≥n, whilst in Galicia the chalice would develop into the modern coat-of-arms of Galicia.

Many of the items offered are not available easily elsewhere on the web or otherwise. Microcosm is also known for incorporating the tactics of early punk record labels, a DIY approach, and guerrilla-style tactics for promoting their titles.

Microcosm struggled to find affordable warehousing for the volume of publishing it was now doing inside inner-Portland. Unable to do so, it opened a mailorder warehouse in Bloomington, Indiana in March 2007. However, because of complications of managing across state lines, this location was closed in July 2011 and a new location replaced it in Lansing, Kansas. One month later, Lansing staffer Jessie Duquette (aka \\"Jessie Duke\\"), an employee since 2006, became co-owner of Microcosm. In August 2012, the organization split into two separate businesses: one that focused primarily on zine distribution (now Pioneers Press), run by Jessie Duke in rural Kansas; and Microcosm Publishing, which focused on the book publishing operation, run by Joe Biel in Oregon.http://microcosmpublishing.com/blogifesto/2012/09/big-changes-in-our- little-world On December 12, 2014 Microcosm merged with Taking the Lane Omnimedia and Elly Blue Publishing to strengthen their respective catalogs with more feminist bicycling titles and added Elly Blue as co-owner and marketing director. Microcosm grew considerably once all operations were consolidated back in Oregon. After paying off the remaining debts from former management, Microcosm was finally able to purchase a former Black credit union building a few blocks from its former location. Over the next eight years sales increased by over 450% and wages were increased by 241%. In 2019, Microcosm resumed distributing its own books from its own building and sales immediately increased 55.77%, sustained for the year, and continued to climb in 2020. ==References== ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== *Microcosm Publishing Category:Small press publishing companies Category:Book publishing companies based in Oregon Category:Companies based in Portland, Oregon Category:Privately held companies based in Oregon Category:Publishing companies established in 1996 Category:1996 establishments in Ohio ","title":"Microcosm Publishing"},{"id":"3255331","text":"Southborough is a town and civil parish in the borough of Tunbridge Wells in Kent, England. It lies immediately to the north of the town of Tunbridge Wells and includes the district of High Brooms, with the A26 road passing through it. According to the 2001 census it had a population of 11,124. The town is within the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. ==Origin of name== After the Norman Conquest, the area came within the domain of Tonbridge Castle, one of 4 boroughs to do so. This was the South Borough. ==Governance== Southborough separated from Tonbridge in 1871 when its own board of health was formed . In 1894, it was recreated to become an urban district, with its own elected council to manage its affairs. It retained that title until 1974, when under local government reorganisation it became a civil parish. By historical accident, however, Southborough had a Town Council, which it has retained. Southborough Town Council consists of 18 members, from the three town wards: North (seven Councillors); West (six Councillors); and East/High Brooms (five Councillors). The posts of mayor and deputy mayor are elected annually. As with many other Parish Councils, its responsibilities are less than those of the local Borough Council. At the same time, Southborough is part of Tunbridge Wells borough: the two wards of that borough are Southborough and High Brooms (three councillors) and Southborough North (two).Setting up parish wards, 2001Southborough Town Council The town has its own grant of heraldry: this includes reference to the cricket ball industry and contains two sprigs of broom, alluding to High Brooms.Southborough Town Council arms (inter alia ==History== The Southborough Society'‚ÄôThe Southborough Society (\\"the civic, heritage and amenity society for Southborough\\") is the main source for many of the facts in this part of the article The remains of an Iguanodon (135 million years ago) was discovered in High Brooms. Before the first millennium AD the land here was heavily forested; however some significant finds have revealed that it was inhabited. Arrowheads and stone axe heads provide evidence of ‚Äò‚Äô'prehistoric'‚Äô‚Äô habitation of Southborough while burial sites from both the Bronze and Iron Ages have also been unearthed. The site of the Castle Hill Iron Age Fort, dating back to 315 BC, lies in the Eastern valley. Routes linking other forts are still part of the town‚Äôs road network. Little is then known about the district until the Norman Conquest as it was the most sparsely populated part of the Weald due to the almost impenetrable forest. Richard Fitz Gilbert (later de Clare) was rewarded for his part in the conquest with land;Notes on other lands granted to Fitzgilbert one such grant was the Lowey of Tunbridge, an area of land equating with the holdings of a manor, which covered some 20,660 acres (8347h) on the Weald and across the River Medway valley. He was also granted the right to build a castle at Tonbridge. The Manor of Southborough was one part of the Lowey. Over the following seven hundred years it had a chequered history. After Richard de Clare, it was held by the Audley and Stafford families until 1521, when Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, was beheaded on Tower Hill and the estates reverted to the Crown. Henry VIII gave the (now separated from Tonbridge) estate to George Boleyn, brother of Anne Boleyn, whose fate he also suffered. It was then passed to John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, who later exchanged it for other estates. Under Elizabeth I it had again reverted to the Crown: she bestowed it on Sir Richard Sackville who sold it to Thomas Smythe of Westernhanger. He was commonly known as Customer Smythe, a \\"farmer\\" of the collection of customs and excise dues. In 1790 when Lady Smythe died the Manor was split up and sold; the Manor House of Great Bounds and the Manorial rights being purchased by the Earl of Darnley who in turn parted with it to James Alexander. The whole area was part of the Royal forest of Southfrith until about the middle of the 16th century, reserved by royalty for hunting. The settlement consisted of a number of isolated hamlets including Nonsuch Green, Holden Corner, Modest Corner and a few houses near the Common. High Brooms was a desolate tract inhabited by Romany Gypsies, very many of Kent's population today will have Gypsy heritage - whether they choose to admit this is another matter. From 1639, lodging houses appeared in Southborough to accommodate visitors to the newly discovered chalybeate spring at The Pantiles, Tunbridge Wells. During the reign of King Charles I, the Cavalier faction tended to stay at Southborough, whilst nearby Rusthall tended to attract visitors from the Roundhead (puritan) faction.Melville, L (1912): Society at Tunbridge Wells in the 18th Century. London: Eveleigh Nash (available at www.theweald.org) ==Industrial Southborough== Iron was worked in the area since prehistoric times, since the underlying rock (the iron-rich sandstone of the Hastings Beds which make up the Weald) provided the raw material. From the mid-16th century onwards there were a number of water-powered furnaces on the two streams running through the town: one at Modest Corner; and three on the Southborough Bourne. The latter included the Vauxhall Furnace, operating from at least 1552, near Mote Farm in what is now Vauxhall Lane: and the Brook (Broakes) Mill opened in 1553. The rock was dug from \\"bell pits\\", and iron smelted here was worked at a forge nearby. The forges probably continued working until the 18th century when the making of iron became uneconomical and in 1771 the sites were taken over for gunpowder manufacturing hence the name Powder Mill Lane. The mill blew up shortly afterwards but was replaced and continued manufacturing gunpowder. By 1845 a cornmill had been erected on the site, which continued in operation until 1942 when it was demolished. There are now no traces of any industrial workings on the site. Apart from that heavy industrial employment, people in Southborough were mainly occupied in Agriculture, Textiles and Transport: trades such as Blacksmiths, Coachbuilders and Harness makers. With cricket being played on the common, it is perhaps logical that the town became renowned for the manufacture of cricket balls. The first recorded makers were Philip Wickham and Joseph Smith of Modest Corner and many other cricket ball makers set up business including Thomas Twort and John Martin in 1853. Southborough began to expand rapidly from 1879 when the Holden Estate was sold and laid out to accommodate 165 new dwellings. The High Brooms Brick and Tile Company started to build houses for its employees and the area expanded: it is now an industrial estate. ==Southborough Common== The Common of Southborough (now owned by the Town Council) has always been part of the Manorial Holding. It was originally around larger but between 1790 and 1810 portions were enclosed so that the total area now is . Under the Commons Registration Act 1965, a number of persons registered their rights as Commoners. In 2003, the whole area of the Common ‚Äì a conservation area ‚Äì was the subject of an appraisal by Tunbridge Wells Borough Council. The appraisal report seeks to retain the historical significance of the Common and its immediate area. Cricket has been played on the Common for over 200 years. ==Twinning== On 18 October 1992, Southborough twinned with the town of Lambersart, France. The Twinning Charter signed by both towns formally resolved to honour the twinning relationship by establishing and maintaining friendly relations with each other, to foster and develop mutual understanding and respect between the people of their respective administrative areas, to favour all kinds of links between the two regions especially in the educational and cultural fields, to encourage exchange visits and to develop human and cultural relationships and establish a firm foundation for future understanding, respect and friendship between their people for all time. To celebrate five years of twinning on 18 October 1997 Lambersart Close on the new Barnetts Wood housing estate was officially unveiled followed by a reception at the Salomons Estate. A friendship between the towns of Southborough and Kaniv in Ukraine began in the year 2001, when representatives of the towns met at the European Project for Youth in Lambersart. The friendship developed strongly and in 2005 the Southborough and Kaniv Association (SAKA) was founded. Now citizens of Southborough visit Kaniv as welcome guests and citizens of Kaniv are similarly welcomed in Southborough. SAKA has its own website - www.southboroughandkanivassociation.com. ==Sport== Southborough has long been associated with sport. Cricket has been played on the common for over 200 years and the town was a centre for cricket ball manufacture until 1978.Southborough Conservation Area Appraisal, Tunbridge Wells Borough Council, August 2003.

A two-platform station was provided by the C&HR;, with a main two-storey building on the eastbound (north) side. A decade later, it became a junction with the opening of a branch line to Denbigh (the Vale of Clwyd Railway) on 5 October 1858. The C&HR; was taken over by the London and North Western Railway a few months later, with the Vale of Clwyd also being leased (and later absorbed) by the LNWR in 1867 to prevent the rival Great Western Railway acquiring it and thus gaining access to the area. Under LNWR auspices the coast line became one of the company's major trunk routes, serving several popular holiday resorts in addition to the port of Holyhead. The rapid increase in traffic led the company to quadruple most of the section between Chester and Llandudno Junction in the 1890s to provide extra capacity. This included the to Abergele stretch in 1897 and the station at Rhyl was remodelled and enlarged as a result. The westbound platform was re-located and widened into an island with an extra loop line on the south side, new bay platforms added (along with new carriage sidings and a large goods yard) and a pair of non-platform lines laid in the centre of the station for use by non-stop trains. A covered footbridge was provided to link the platforms, along with extensive awnings to shelter passengers and two large brick and timber signal boxes built to control the new layout. These were all completed and the new layout commissioned in 1900.North Wales Signalling - Rhyl Alan's Railway Images; Retrieved 13 January 2017 Rhyl would remain a popular holiday destination throughout the 20th century, though after World War II and nationalisation of the railway system in 1948 the Denbigh branch would see its service reduced; the line eventually closing to passenger traffic in September 1955. Excursions and goods traffic would continue until the line's eventual closure to all traffic in March 1965. The 1960s and 70s would also see the main line gradually lose much of the additional infrastructure added by the LNWR as road competition and changing holiday habits led to a decline in summer passenger numbers (along with the Beeching closures of many of the line's intermediate stations). By 1976 both slow lines towards Abergele had been lifted, along with west-end bays at the station and the up slow westwards to Prestatyn, whilst the down loop platform saw use only on summer weekends. The remaining down slow from Prestatyn, goods sidings and platform 3 line at the station survived until 1990, when they were also lifted (along with the up fast line through the station) and Rhyl No2 signal box closed. Though the latter still survives (though boarded up, it is a listed building), the site of the old platform 3 and goods yard has been redeveloped (now a supermarket and associated car park). Only the two through platforms remain in use in 2016, along with the down through line and a pair of engineers sidings. These were formerly supervised from the former No.1 signal box, but this was made redundant in March 2018, when a new modular colour light signalling system controlled from the South Wales Rail Operating Centre was brought into use between and Colwyn Bay as part of a ¬£50 million route upgrade project.\\"Network Rail ¬£50m upgrade will see new signalling system installed from Shotton to Colwyn Bay\\" Deeside.com news article 13 February 2017; Retrieved 4 August 2017 ==Facilities== Ticket barriers are in operation at the station; the ticket office on platform 1 is manned throughout the week.

She has published a number of books and academic articles, including on Cleopatra, and made numerous television and radio appearances. In 2003, she controversially claimed to have identified the mummy of Queen Nefertiti. Her findings have been defended successfully and even validated by former critics. ==Early life and education== Fletcher was born on 30 August 1966 in Barnsley. She was educated at Barnsley College, a sixth form, and further education college in Barnsley. She studied ancient history and Egyptology at University College London, specialising in the Ptolemaic dynasty and Cleopatra, and also in ancient Egyptian hair, wigs, and forms of adornment. She was graduated with a bachelor of arts (BA) degree in 1987. Her doctor of philosophy (PhD) degree was undertaken at the University of Manchester. Her doctoral thesis was on hair and wigs; it was entitled \\"Ancient Egyptian Hair: a study in style, form, and function\\". Her PhD was completed in 1996. ==Career== Currently, Fletcher is honorary visiting professor in the Department of Archaeology at the University of York and Head of the Egypt Exploration Society‚Äôs Local Ambassador Programme. She is a consultant Egyptologist for Harrogate Museums and Arts and an archaeology consultant for the museums of Wigan and for Barnsley, for whom she curated a trio of exhibitions in 2017-2018. In addition, she has contributed to the galleries at the National Museum of Ireland, the Great North Museum in Newcastle, Sheffield‚Äôs Weston Park Museum, and Scarborough‚Äôs Rotunda Museum, as well as having made contributions to the Burrell Collection in Glasgow, a series of mummification exhibitions at Bolton, Burnley, Warrington, and Hull & East Riding museums, and she made contributions to Leiden's Rijksmuseum as part of their 1994 exhibition \\"Clothing of the Pharaohs\\". In 2012, she and Dr. Stephen Buckley worked with Sheffield‚Äôs Medico-Legal Centre to mummify a human body donor. They continued this long-term project with the Gordon Museum of Pathology at King‚Äôs College London, where the body is housed, in line with the wishes of the individual and his family. In 2003, Fletcher designed the first UK GCSE equivalent qualification in Egyptology on behalf of the government education body ABC Centra, a programme that ended in 2008. She is co-founder of the York University Mummy Research Group, with whom she has studied human remains from South America, Yemen, Italy, Ireland, the Canary Islands, and Egypt, including the royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings. She has undertaken excavation work in Egypt, Yemen, and the UK, and has examined mummies both on-site and in collections around the world. Fletcher writes for The Guardian newspaper and the BBC History Magazine and Web site (including major input into their multimedia project 'Death in Sakkara', which won the New Media Award in 2005) and has made numerous appearances on television and radio. She was lead investigator and series consultant in the History Channel television series Mummy Forensics, was at the centre of Mummifying Alan: Egypt's Last Secret, a documentary for Channel 4 and Discovery, the subject of a long-term project she initiated with Dr. Stephen Buckley that rewrote the current understanding of mummification. As part of this documentary she won the 2011 Royal Television Society Award for Science and Natural History, the BAFTA Award for Specialist Factual programme, and an AIB (Association for International Broadcasting) Award for Best Science programme. In 2015, she was the recipient of the prestigious ‚ÄòSurprise Award‚Äô presented at the Proud of Barnsley Awards Ceremony and in 2016, she received the Freedom of the Borough of Barnsley for exceptional service to the Borough award. Her publications include The Story of Egypt, Cleopatra the Great and The Search for Nefertiti, together with guidebooks, journal articles, and academic papers. ==Queen Nefertiti== In 2003, Fletcher and a multidisciplinary scientific team from the University of York, including the forensic anthropologist, Don Brothwell, took part in an expedition to the Valley of the Kings in Egypt that was sanctioned by Dr Zahi Hawass, then head of the Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA). The investigation pursued a hypothesis put forward by Fletcher that one of the three mummies studied could be the mummified body of Queen Nefertiti. All three of the mummified bodies had been found among a cache of mummies in tomb KV35 in 1898. The team's scientific findings supported this and the hypothesis was included in the official report submitted to Hawass and the SCA shortly after the 2003 expedition. The expedition, the result of 12 years of research, was funded by the Discovery Channel, which also produced a documentary on the findings. Fletcher's conclusions were dismissed by the majority of Egyptologists (some of whom previously claimed that the mummy in question was a male as young as fifteen years old {a theory now disproven}),Hawass, Zahi et al. \\"Ancestry and Pathology in King Tutankhamun's Family\\" The Journal of the American Medical Association, 17 February 2010. Vol 303, No. 7 p.638-647 and the evidence used to support Fletcher's theories was declared as insufficient, circumstantial, and inconclusive. Archaeology, a publication of the Archaeological Institute of America, asserted that Fletcher's \\"identification of the mummy in question as Nefertiti is balderdash\\".Mark Rose, \\"Where's Nefertiti?\\", Archaeology, 16 September 2004. Zahi Hawass, head of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, subsequently banned her from working in Egypt because he said \\"Dr. Fletcher has broken the rules\\". Hawass explained this action in an article in the newspaper Al-Ahram: :\\"There are more than 300 foreign expeditions currently working in Egypt, and they all follow the same guidelines. We grant concessions to any scholar affiliate to a scientific or educational institution, and it has long been accepted code of ethics that any discovery made during excavations should first be reported to the SCA. By going first to the press with what might be considered a great discovery, Fletcher broke the bond made by York University with the Egyptian authorities. And by putting out in the popular media what is considered by most scholars to be an unsound theory, Fletcher has broken the rules and therefore, at least until we have reviewed the situation with her university, she must be banned from working in Egypt.\\" According to The Times newspaper, British archaeologists \\"leapt to her defence\\", however, and they reported that the research team members stood by their findings. The team members maintained that no rules were broken, on the basis that the official report submitted to the SCA included Fletcher's hypothesis, described by others as a 'discovery', and that Hawass had been informed of what was to be put forward in the television programme prior to the Discovery Channel documentary being aired.Ian Parker, \\"The Pharaoh: Is Zahi Hawass bad for Egyptology?\\", The New Yorker, 16 November 2009 Soon, professional publications revealed that others, including a fierce critic at the time, agreed with Professor Fletcher‚Äôs original identification,Nile Magazine 14, June‚ÄìJuly 2018, p. 46-55 (and Editorial, p. 3) ‚Äì to cite below and eventually, the Hawass ban was lifted.

He was a pioneer in the field of shape perception and on the interaction between mental processes and the involuntary movements of the body. He became famous, particularly in Portugal, because of his interpretation of the inscriptions present on the surface of Dighton Rock, a boulder on the shore of the Taunton River, in southeastern Massachusetts. He attributed the carvings to Miguel Corte-Real, a Portuguese navigator who left Lisbon in May 1502 on an exploration trip to the western Atlantic, never to return.

The Routledge Companion to Nazi Germany, p. 243. Prior to his ministry, Seldte served as the Federal Leader of Der Stahlhelm World War I ex-servicemen's organisation from 1918 to 1934. Ideologically, he identified as a national conservative. ==Early life and education== Born in Magdeburg in the Prussian province of Saxony, Seldte was the son of an owner of a factory producing chemical products and soda water.Stackelberg (2007). The Routledge Companion to Nazi Germany, p. 243. He attended the Wilhelm-Raabe-Gymnasium in Magdeburg and, after an apprenticeship as a salesman, studied chemistry at the universities of Braunschweig and Greifswald. In 1908 he took over the business of his early deceased father.Wistrich (2001). Who's Who In Nazi Germany, p. 232. As an officer of the German Army he was wounded in World War I and lost his left arm.Stackelberg (2007). The Routledge Companion to Nazi Germany, p. 243. He then became a front reporter. Awarded with the Iron Cross 2nd and 1st class,Snyder (1976). Encyclopedia of the Third Reich, p. 320. Seldte also was promoted to the rank of Hauptmann d.R. in the 66th Infantry Regiment. ==Der Stahlhelm== Seldte (r.) with Hugenberg and the Berlin Stahlhelm leader von Stephani at a rally against the Young-Plan, Berlin Sportpalast, 1929 As a reaction to the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919, Seldte founded Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten on 25 December 1918, agitating against the Treaty of Versailles and German war reparations. According to Seldte, the organization was to use the spirit of the Frontsoldaten against the ‚Äòswinish revolution‚Äô taking place in Germany under the Weimar government.Snyder (1976). Encyclopedia of the Third Reich, p. 320. While he took charge of Der Stahlhelm from 1923 onwards, he had to cope with the constant rivalry of his deputy leader, the militant Theodor Duesterberg. Seldte became a member of the national conservative German National People's Party (DNVP) and was a member of the Magdeburg city council (Stadtrat). During the later years of the Weimar Republic Der Stahlhelm became increasingly anti-democratic and anti- republican. However, Seldte hoped that the organization could become a leading organ of a united right-wing movement. In 1929 it united its forces with the DNVP under Alfred Hugenberg, the Pan-German League and the Nazi Party to initiate a German referendum against the Young Plan on World War I reparations.Kershaw (2000). Hitler: 1889-1936, Hubris, p. 310, 356. The common goal was to denounce the Chancellor Hermann M√ºller and his ministers as traitors to their country, nevertheless the plebiscite failed to reach the quorum. In 1931 Seldte helped create the short-lived Harzburg Front,Zentner & Bed√ºrftig, eds. The Encyclopedia of the Third Reich, vol. 2, (M-Z), p. 869. a right-wing alliance against the government of M√ºller's successor Heinrich Br√ºning. ==Minister for Labour== During the negotiations for the Chancellorship of Germany between Franz von Papen and Hitler in mid-January 1933, Seldte threw his vote and Der Stahlhelm behind Hitler, after which, Papen acquiesced to Hitler‚Äôs demands.Longerich (2012). Heinrich Himmler, p. 144. On the day of the Machtergreifung on 30 January 1933, Seldte joined the Hitler Cabinet as Reich Minister for Labour,Shirer (1990). The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, p. 184. once again outdoing his long-time rival Duesterberg. In the run-up to the elections of March 1933 Der Stahlhelm together with Hugenberg's national conservative German National People's Party (DNVP) attempted to make the Kampffront Schwarz-Wei√ü-Rot (\\"Black White Red Combat Front\\") into the dominant political camp on the right, but ultimately failed as it only gained 8.0% of the votes cast. Nevertheless, Seldte obtained a seat in the Reichstag parliament as a DNVP \\"guest\\". On 27 April 1933 Seldte finally joined the Nazi Party and merged Der Stahlhelm into Ernst R√∂hm's Sturmabteilung (SA) militia ‚Äì de facto placing it at the disposal of Hitler.Bracher (1970). The German Dictatorship: The Origins, Structure, and Effects of National Socialism, p. 222. In August 1933, he was awarded the rank of SA-Obergruppenf√ºhrer and later was appointed Reichskommissar for the Freiwilliger Arbeitsdienst employment program, but was soon superseded by his state secretary Konstantin Hierl as leader of the Reichsarbeitsdienst organization. In March 1934 Seldte was made the federal leader of the Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher frontk√§mpfer-Bund (Stahlhelm) () (NSDFBSt), a successor organization of Der Stahlhelm, which however was soon disbanded. In 1935 he requested to be released from official responsibilities, but Hitler refused. Throughout his tenure as chief of the Labor Ministry, Seldte never enjoyed the full support of Hitler, who did not think he was worth much. As a result, members of the Nazi hierarchy began encroaching on his areas of responsibility and Seldte was marginalized accordingly.Fischer (1995). Nazi Germany: A New History, p. 315. For instance, Hermann Goering‚Äôs Four Year Plan which he began to implement in late 1936, ran roughshod over Seldte's Labor Ministry altogether.Evans (2006). The Third Reich in Power, p. 358. Seldte, without substantial power, remained Reich Minister for Labour until the end of World War II and was also a member of the Prussian government under Minister president Hermann G√∂ring as State Labour Minister. Even after Hitler‚Äôs suicide and the nomination of Grand-Admiral D√∂nitz as his successor, Seldte kept his post, being accordingly named Labour Minister.Mazower (2009). Hitler‚Äôs Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe, pp. 532‚Äì533. ==Death== Seldte was captured and arrested in Mondorf-les-Bains at the end of the war. During the Nuremberg trials, Seldte tried to exonerate himself by claiming that he had stood against the dictatorship of Hitler and that he advocated for a two-chamber system of parliamentary governance.Taylor & Shaw (2002). Dictionary of the Third Reich, p. 261. His story was not convincing. Seldte died in a US military hospital in April 1947 at F√ºrth, before the Nuremberg Tribunal had the chance to formally arraign him on charges.Snyder (1976). Encyclopedia of the Third Reich, p. 320. ==Legacy== During the time of Nazi Germany, streets were named after him in several German cities, among them his hometown Magdeburg and Leverkusen.Franz-Seldte-Str.

Joining his father in some of his travels, he was exposed to the lifestyle and the music of the gauchos of Buenos Aires Province from his early days. His maternal great-grandfather, named Lionel, was a British immigrant, and fought against the Pampas tribes in the mid-19th century, being wounded by a spear. From him, Rivero inherited his blond hair and his first name. In his teens, Rivero's family moved to the Belgrano neighborhood, in the days where tango developed as a dancing phenomenon, but also as an ever more complex music form under the \\"ABC\\" of composers/directors Arolas, Bardi, and Cobi√°n. At the same time, the themes of tango lyrics evolved from light-hearted ribaldry into more complex stories delving on love and manly honor. Rivero learned classic guitar and also trained as a singer; he had a deep bass-baritone voice that was one of his trademarks,Valdes-Socin H, De Herder WW, Beckers A. The acromegalic voice of Tango: Don Edmundo Rivero. J Endocrinol Invest. 2015 Jul 11. together with his huge hands (due to his acromegaly) that made him the butt of many jokes. ===Singing career=== Edmundo Rivero performing. After working as a cover singer in small venues, Rivero got his first radio appearance singing a duet with his sister Eva in Radio Cultura. He spent the early 1930s alternating radio work with dance hall gigs. After singing for bandleader Jos√© De Caro in 1935, Rivero's qualities attracted Jos√©'s more famous brother Julio De Caro, who drafted Rivero into his orchestra, which incorporated non-traditional instruments and was a fixture of the Pueyrred√≥n theatre ballroom in Flores. Rivero gained some fame, and the moniker that stayed with him forever: el feo (the ugly guy). Even though Rivero was featured in many Argentine films in the 1930s and 1940s, the early forties were a time of uncertainty for him. Even bandleaders who did hire him (such as Humberto Canaro) would not retain him for long. Later, Rivero would claim that his deep voice was a severe handicap during this time. In 1944, Rivero joined Horacio Salg√°n. His three-year tenure there left no recordings (with his Bart√≥k influences, Salg√°n was too \\"far out\\" for the general tango audience) but earned Rivero the respect of avant-garde and jazz musicians. To make ends meet, Rivero also worked in a duo with fellow singer Carlos Berm√∫dez that recorded tangos in a more commercial vein for the Colombian market. In 1947, Rivero was hired by An√≠bal Troilo, who was having a stellar run of recordings with new hit songs, many of them in collaboration with lyricist Homero Manzi. During his three years with Troilo, Rivero shared the limelight with Floreal Ruiz and Aldo Calder√≥n, and recorded 22 songs, including the mega-hit Sur, where Troilo's melody frames Manzi's elegy for a young love and also for the old barrio. Having found fame and fortune, Rivero left Troilo in 1950 and started a solo career. For accompaniment, he would alternate between guitar quartets and a full orchestral format for the remainder of his career. The most famous musician to follow Rivero was guitarist Roberto Grela, who was also the guitarist of Troilo's quartet. Guitar-only formations were used by countryside milonga artists, early tango singers, and even Carlos Gardel in his youth, but Rivero's 1950s recordings, during a period of total dominance by big orchestras, was a bold statement, which forever cemented his identification with the silent masculinity of the countryside, as opposed to the emphasis that \\"urban\\" tango put on stories of lost love. In the sixties, Salg√°n and Rivero had their revenge, and recorded several tunes together. Rivero also collaborated with other artists, who noted his generosity and his devotion to music. In 1966 he appeared in the film Buenos Aires, verano 1912. ===El Viejo Almac√©n=== Rivero singing with his guitar while then president of Argentina, Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n (sitting in front of him) and other people laugh (1984). By the late 1960s, tango had become mostly \\"for export\\", since musicians and audiences were aging and making little progress from the orchestral format of the 1940s and 1950s. many tango fans rejected the music of √Åstor Piazzolla and his followers, but Rivero himself admired Piazzolla, and recorded his creations on more than one occasion. Even major artists had trouble finding venues to play. Fearing for tango's viability, in 1969 Rivero opened El Viejo Almac√©n (\\"The old store\\"), a tango club in the San Telmo district. His hospitality was enjoyed by many visitors to Buenos Aires, who went to Rivero's club to savor the tango music and dance in its full intensity. Among the recurring visitors were Joan Manuel Serrat and Camilo Jos√© Cela. Rivero's place was a venue for tango, where musicians knew they would be respected and paid on time. Famed tango lyricist Horacio Ferrer wrote a milonga about the almac√©n for which Rivero later composed the music, and took to calling Rivero by his forgotten first name, Leonel, a gesture that many friends would imitate. Rivero was an icon in Japanese tango circles. He toured Japan in 1968, and got to know many Japanese musicians and dancers. Rivero composed \\"Arigato Jap√≥n\\" and \\"A lo Megata\\" (honoring Tsunayoshi \\"Tsunami\\" Megata, one of the top tango dancers of his age). Japanese tourists were a constant presence in Rivero's place. Rivero hosted a TV show in the early seventies, which featured artists from the club (such as Beba Bidart), as well as lively dialog sprinkled with lunfardo. Some of his 1960s and 1970s reunions with Troilo and Grela were televised. In 1980, Rivero took part in Osvaldo Pugliese's 75th birthday concert. In his later years, he delegated the day-to-day operation of the club to his son Edmundo (\\"Muni\\"). Rivero was hospitalized in late 1985, and died from heart failure on January 18, 1986, in Buenos Aires. In February 2011 it was reported that many artifacts germane to Rivero's legacy were stolen from a warehouse in Ramos Mej√≠a. ==Selected recordings== * ' (perhaps the most popular tango in Argentina) * ' (an underworld saga sprinkled with heavy doses of lunfardo) * ' (a sonnet sung as a milonga‚Äîthe lyrics lead to a dramatic ending) * '''' * '''' * '''' * '''' * '''' * '''' ==ReferencesEdmundo Rivero on todotango.com * Edmundo Rivero on tango.info Category:1911 births Category:1986 deaths Category:Argentine male singers Category:Argentine people of British descent Category:Tango singers Category:People from Buenos Aires Province Category:Burials at La Chacarita Cemetery Category:20th-century Argentine singers Category:20th-century male singers ","title":"Edmundo Rivero"},{"id":"3255451","text":"The Wilder Park Conservatory is a conservatory and botanical garden located in Wilder Park at 225 Prospect Avenue in Elmhurst, Illinois.

Members of the other section, formed out of the exiled BLPI nucleus, effectively maintained a separate party, the Bolshevik Samasamaja Party (BSP). The latter group functioned as the Ceylon section of BLPI and was led by Colvin R de Silva, Leslie Goonawardene and Edmund Samarakkoddy. The relation between the two groups was often antagonistic. The BSP, which concentrated on building a cadre party, accused LSSP of 'organisational Menshevism'. The LSSP wanted to build a mass-based party and accused the BSP of being introvert doctrinaires. On 25 October 1945 fist- fights broke out between the two groups at a meeting of the BSP. In 1946 there was a brief reconciliation between the two factions. At the general election of 1947, the LSSP emerged as the main opposition party, with 10 seats. The BSP obtained 5 seats. The BLPI-affiliated BSP became an independent party in 1948, and was recognized as the Lankan section of the Fourth International, when the BLPI was dissolved.

Nicknamed \\"Buddy\\", at age eight he got his first guitar and soon began performing live with his father's band, The Fremont River Rangers. Three years later, he appeared with his father live on local television station KDYL in Salt Lake City. When the family moved to Los Angeles, California in the early 1950s, he continued to perfect his musical skills, playing both the acoustic guitar and the steel guitar. He also began to do home recordings of himself playing rhythm guitar to a song. == The Lawrence Welk Show == Buddy Merrill joined The Lawrence Welk Show in 1955, the same year it first went national on ABC. On the Welk Show, he performed his guitar version of \\"Blue Suede Shoes,\\" a popular hit by Elvis Presley in 1956. (Retrieved from \\"The Lawrence Show.\\" PBS TV. May 12, 2018) He briefly left the show from 1959 to 1962 when he was drafted by the Army. On his return to the Music Makers he was joined in the band's rhythm section with fellow guitarist Neil Levang. For the next twelve years the two would perform together on television. Merrill used a Fender Stratocaster guitar for many of his TV appearances. ==Accomplishments after Welk== In 1974, Merrill left the Welk orchestra to devote more time to writing music and recording for Accent Records.Profile, AccentRecords.com; accessed December 4, 2014. He continued to perform live, either as a solo artist or with a band, until 1988 when he retired from the road. He continued to perform as a studio musician. He penned a symphonic work, \\"Living Sea\\", as well as original compositions for tape programmers and television commercials. Today he lives in Murrieta, California with his wife Connie, whom he married in 1983. ==Discography== * Classics in Rhythm, Accent ACD 5054, 2001 * Classic Guitars, Accent ACD 6042, 2001 * Guitars Express, ACD 6041, 1998 * The Exciting Guitars of Buddy Merrill, ACD 5038, 1998 * World of Guitars, ACD 6030, 1994 (sampler of Buddy's compositions) * Beyond the Reef, ACD 5034, 1992 * Classics in Rhythm, ACS 5054, 1980 * Guitar Sounds of Buddy Merrill, ACS 50100, 1977 * Buddy Merrill Today, ACS 5052, 1975 * Upbeat M.O.R., ACS 5048, 1975 * World of Guitars, ACS 5042, 1972 * Country Capers, ACS 5040, 1972 * 25 Great All-Time Hits, ACS 5038, 1971 * Steel Guitar Country,ACS 5036, 1970 * Beyond the Reef,ACS 5034, 1970 * Guitar Sounds of the 70's, ACS 5032, 1970 * The Best of Buddy Merrill, ACS 5034, 1969 * Electrosonic Guitars, ACS 5028, 1969 * Land of a Thousand Guitars, ACS 5026, 1967 * Sounds of Love, ACS 5024, 1967 * The Many Splendored Guitars of Buddy Merrill, ACS 5022, 1967 * Guitars on Fire, Accent SQBO 91997 * The Exciting World of Buddy Merrill, ACS 5020, 1966 * Latin Festival, ACS 5018, 1966 * Holiday from Guitars, Accent AC 5016, 1965 * The Guitar Sounds of Buddy Merrill, ACS 5010, 1965 * Songs of the Islands (with Lawrence Welk), Dot DLP 3251, 1960 (re-issued by Ranwood R 8022 and R 2007) ==References== ==External links== *Biography, SpaceAgePop.com; accessed December 4, 2014. *Profile, welkmusicalfamily.com; accessed December 4, 2014. *Interview with Buddy Merrill for the NAMM (National Association of Music Merchants) Oral History Program February 15, 2011 *Flea market Funk: Buddy Merrill ‚Äì Funky Category:1936 births Category:Living people Category:Guitarists from Utah Category:People from Wayne County, Utah Category:People from Greater Los Angeles Category:Lawrence Welk Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:Guitarists from Los Angeles Category:American male guitarists ","title":"Buddy Merrill"},{"id":"3255478","text":"Skelmersdale and Holland was an urban district in Lancashire, England from 1968 to 1974.

Generally more costly than ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals are used because of desirable properties such as low weight (e.g. aluminium), higher conductivity (e.g. copper), non- magnetic property or resistance to corrosion (e.g. zinc). Some non-ferrous materials are also used in the iron and steel industries. For example, bauxite is used as flux for blast furnaces, while others such as wolframite, pyrolusite and chromite are used in making ferrous alloys. All pure metals are non-ferrous elements except iron (also called ferrite, chemical symbol Fe, from the Latin ferrum, meaning \\"iron\\"). Important non-ferrous metals include aluminium, copper, lead, nickel, tin, titanium and zinc, and alloys such as brass. Precious metals such as gold, silver and platinum and exotic or rare metals such as cobalt, mercury, tungsten, beryllium, bismuth, cerium, cadmium, niobium, indium, gallium, germanium, lithium, selenium, tantalum, tellurium, vanadium, and zirconium are also non-ferrous. They are usually obtained through minerals such as sulfides, carbonates, and silicates. Non-ferrous metals are usually refined through electrolysis. ==Recycling and pollution control== Due to their extensive use, non-ferrous scrap metals are usually recycled. The secondary materials in scrap are vital to the metallurgy industry, as the production of new metals often needs them. Some recycling facilities re-smelt and recast non-ferrous materials; the dross is collected and stored onsite while the metal fumes are filtered and collected. Non- ferrous scrap metals are sourced from industrial scrap materials, particle emissions and obsolete technology (for example, copper cables) scrap. ==Ancient history== Non-ferrous metals were the first metals used by humans for metallurgy. Gold, silver and copper existed in their native crystalline yet metallic form. These metals, though rare, could be found in quantities sufficient to attract the attention of humans. Less susceptible to oxygen than most other metals, they can be found even in weathered outcroppings. Copper was the first metal to be forged; it was soft enough to be fashioned into various objects by cold forging and could be melted in a crucible. Gold, silver and copper replaced some of the functions of other resources, such as wood and stone, owing to their ability to be shaped into various forms for different uses. Due to their rarity, these gold, silver and copper artifacts were treated as luxury items and handled with great care. The use of copper also heralded the transition from the Stone Age to the Copper Age. The Bronze Age, which succeeded the Copper Age, was again heralded by the invention of bronze, an alloy of copper with the non-ferrous metal tin. == Mechanical and structural use == It is used in residential, commercial, industrial industry. Material selection for a mechanical or structural application requires some important considerations, including how easily the material can be shaped into a finished part and how its properties can be either intentionally or inadvertently altered in the process. Depending on the end use, metals can be simply cast into the finished part, or cast into an intermediate form, such as an ingot, then worked, or wrought, by rolling, forging, extruding, or other deformation process. Although the same operations are used with ferrous as well as nonferrous metals and alloys, the reaction of nonferrous metals to these forming processes is often more severe. Consequently, properties may differ considerably between the cast and wrought forms of the same metal or alloy. ==References== Category:Metals Category:Alloys Category:Metallurgy ","title":"Non-ferrous metal"},{"id":"3255481","text":"Cyto-Stain, or CytoStain, is commercially available mix of staining dyes for polychromatic staining in histology.

He authored Acoustics, considered a classic textbook in this field, and its updated and extended version published in 2012 under the title Acoustics: Sound Fields and Transducers. He was also an expert in the design and evaluation of concert halls and opera houses, and authored the classic textbook Music, Acoustics, and Architecture, revised and extended in 2004 under the title Concert Halls and Opera Houses: Music, Acoustics, and Architecture. == Early life and education == Beranek was born in 1914 in Solon, Iowa. His father Edward Fred Beranek was a farmer whose ancestors came from Bohemia (in what is now the Czech Republic) and his mother Beatrice Stahle, previously a schoolteacher, had become a farmwife. Edward's paternal grandparents Josef Ber√°nek and Anna ≈†imandlov√° were from Nynice and Jarov respectively. Beranek first started school in a one-room schoolhouse in Tipton, Iowa. After his first year, he rode in a horse-drawn school bus on a two-hour trip to a somewhat larger school. In 1922 his family moved back to Solon, where he was soon skipped over third grade and moved directly into fourth grade classes. Around that time, a baby brother was born, named Lyle Edward Beranek. In 1924 Beranek's father brought home a battery-powered radio containing a single vacuum tube. His eldest son became fascinated with both the technology and the musical aspects of radio. In the harsh winter of January 1926, Beranek's mother died suddenly, leaving his father with huge debts and forcing his father to sell the farm within two months. In junior high school Beranek earned his first independent money by selling silk stockings and fabric. Beranek's father remarried and moved the family to the nearby town of Mount Vernon, Iowa, where he became co- owner of a hardware store. At his father's suggestion, Beranek learned radio repair via a correspondence course, and apprenticed to an older repairman. The younger Beranek quickly learned the trade, and was soon able to buy a Model T automobile. He also earned some spare cash by playing trap drums in a 6-person dance band. He continued to excel in his studies, including a typing class (rarely studied by boys) where he was the top performer. Beranek applied for and was accepted at nearby Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa. In the aftermath of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, money was tight, but he had managed to save $500. Worried about the shaky financial situation, he went to his bank and managed to withdraw $400 to pay his college tuition in advance. The bank failed the next day, and Beranek lost the remaining $100. During freshman year at college, Beranek was told by his father that he could not expect any family money and that he was on his own. In the summers of 1932 and 1933 Beranek worked as a field hand on local farms, to earn tuition money and to improve his physical condition. Beranek moved into two rooms above a bakery, shared with three other students to save money. He also continued to repair radios and played in a dance band, but falling income forced him to consider dropping down to a single class (in mathematics) during the next academic year. In August 1933 Beranek was invited to accompany the family of a local dentist to the Century of Progress World's Fair in Chicago. This was his first trip to a big city and it was a revelation. He attended concert performances by the Chicago Symphony and Detroit Symphony daily, was dazzled by the displays of industrial products and technology, and fascinated by the international pavilions. He lived on a shoestring, spending a total of $12 for four days, and felt compelled to make a return trip the following summer. In college Beranek became friends with a fellow student who had an amateur radio setup, inspiring him to study Morse Code and to earn his own amateur radio license. In fall of 1933, he bought an early disc sound recorder to earn a modest fee by recording students before and after taking a speech training class. This was his first hands-on experience with the developing science of acoustics. By early 1934 he was forced to drop out of college and work full- time to earn more tuition money. He found a position at the fledgling Collins Radio Company of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where he studied German in his spare time. While there, he also met and dated Florence \\"Floss\\" Martin, a business school student. He was able to save enough money to attend the Spring 1935 semester at Cornell College, then returned to Collins Radio for the summer. In August 1935 Beranek had a chance encounter with a stranger whose car had developed a flat tire while passing through Mount Vernon. While helping the stranger (who turned out to be Glenn Browning), he learned that the passing motorist had written a technical paper on radio technology. When Beranek mentioned plans for graduate school, Browning encouraged him to apply to Harvard University, a possibility he had regarded as financially out of reach. Beranek was very busy in his final year at Cornell, running a radio repair and sales business and then transitioning to house wiring for electricity, while carrying a full course load. He managed three major wiring jobs for Cornell, including designing and installing a master antenna system in a new men's dormitory then under construction. He also continued to date his girlfriend Floss. Beranek graduated from Cornell College in summer 1936 with a Bachelor of Arts. He continued studies at Harvard University, where he received a doctorate in 1940. ==Career== During World War II Beranek managed Harvard's electro-acoustics laboratory, which designed communications and noise reduction systems for World War II aircraft, while at the same time developing other military technologies. During this time he built the first anechoic chamber, an extremely quiet room for studying noise effects which later would inspire John Cage's philosophy of silence. In 1945 Beranek became involved with a small company called Hush-A-Phone, which marketed a cup that fit over the mouthpiece of a telephone receiver in order to prevent the person speaking from being overheard. Although Hush-A-Phone had been around since the 1920s, Beranek used his acoustical expertise to develop an improved version of the device. AT&T; threatened Hush-A-Phone users with termination of their telephone service. At the time, AT&T; maintained a monopoly on American telephone service and telephones were leased from AT&T;, rather than owned by customers. The resulting legal case, Hush-A-Phone v. United States, resulted in a victory for Hush-A-Phone. In finding that AT&T; did not have the right to restrict use of the Hush-A-Phone, the courts established a precedent that would eventually lead to the breakup of AT&T;'s monopoly. Beranek joined the staff at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as professor of communications engineering from 1947 to 1958. In 1948, he helped found Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN), serving as the company's president from 1952 to 1969. He continued to serve as chief scientist of BBN through 1971, as he led Boston Broadcasters, Inc. which (after a court battle) took control of television station WCVB-TV. Beranek's 1954 book, Acoustics, is considered the classic textbook in this field; it was revised in 1986. In 2012, at the age of 98, he collaborated with Tim Mellow to produce an updated and extended revision, published under the new title Acoustics: Sound Fields and Transducers.\\"Book Review: A classic text unexpectedly revised\\". HIFICRITIC, 9 January 2013 archived from the original on 17 September 2013. His famous adage was Beranek's Law about psychological effect of somebody's own design and comparison to other designs. == Beranek's Law == It has been remarked that if one selects his own components, builds his own enclosure, and is convinced he has made a wise choice of design, then his own loudspeaker sounds better to him than does anyone else's loudspeaker. In this case, the frequency response of the loudspeaker seems to play only a minor part in forming a person's opinion. Beranek's 1962 book, Music, Acoustics, and Architecture, developed from his analysis of 55 concert halls throughout the world, also became a classic; the 2004 edition of the text expanded the study to 100 halls. Beranek has participated in the design of numerous concert halls and opera houses, and has traveled worldwide to conduct his research and to enjoy musical performances. From 1983 to 1986, Beranek was chairman of the board of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, where he remained a Life Trustee. He also served on the MIT Council for the Arts, \\"an international volunteer group of alumni and friends established to support the arts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\". In 2008 he published Riding the Waves : A Life in Sound, Science, and Industry, an autobiography about his lengthy career and research in sound and music. He turned 100 in September 2014, an occasion marked by a special celebration at Boston Symphony Hall. Beranek died on October 10, 2016 at the age of 102. His last paper, \\"Concert hall acoustics: Recent findings\\", had been published earlier that year. ==Awards and honors== * Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1952) * Wallace Clement Sabine Medal of the Acoustical Society of America (1961) for internationally recognized achievements in all phases of architectural acoustics, and his publications on acoustical measurements, and the world's great concert halls. * Gold Medal of the Audio Engineering Society (1971) * Gold Medal from the Acoustical Society of America (1975) for leadership in developing, in the United States and abroad, the desire and the capability for achieving good acoustics in communications, workplaces, concert halls, and communities. * National Medal of Science in Engineering (2002) * IEEE Founders Medal (2013) * Rayleigh Medal of the Institute of Acoustics, United Kingdom (2014) == In popular culture == Beranek appeared on the television game show To Tell the Truth in 1962, around the time of the opening of Philharmonic Hall at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City.

Among many Iranian poets who shaped up the New Persian Poetry or New Poetry (in Persian: She'r-e Now), Ali Esfandiari aka Nima Yooshij, Parviz Natel Khanlari, Nader Naderpour, Forough Farrokhzad, Mehdi Akhavan Saless, Sohrab Sepehri, Fereydoon Moshiri, Siavash Kasrai, Ahmad Shamlu, Hushang Ebtehaj, and Mohammad-Reza Shafiei Kadkani are considered to be the most famous, skillful, and professional. Though Nima Yooshij (1896‚Äì1960) is known as the Father of New Persian Poetry, aka Nimaii Poetry or She'r-e Nimaii, according to a number of eminent and highly respected literary and poetry scholars Nader Naderpour is considered as the first Iranian poet who opened up exciting vistas of the new Persian poetry. ==Personal life == Nader Naderpour was born on 6 June 1929 in Tehran, Iran. His parents were both fluent in French and had a deep love for art, music and history. His father, Taghi Mirza, was a descendant of Reza Gholi Mirza, the eldest son of Nader Shah. The eldest of two brothers and three sisters, Naderpour grew up under the supervision and care of his culturally rich parents. His father, who died when Naderpour was only fourteen, was a skillful painter and also a man familiar with poetry and literature. It was he who taught young Naderpour Persian literature and classic poetry. When he was a preschooler, Naderpour would sit on his father's lap and be encouraged to read the newspaper every night. His father also had Naderpour memorize classical and modern poetry. His mother was a talented player of the string instrument the tar, and she helped Naderpour to develop an appreciation for music. In 1942 during World War II, Naderpour entered Iran-Shahr High School in Tehran. A year later when Iran was occupied by the Allied military forces, Naderpour, like many other students of the time, got involved in politics, and he participated in a small nationalist party group. Later he joined the Tudeh Party of Iran (TPI), which became the major Communist Party of the country. Like Nima, Naderpour also published a number of poems in journals such as People (in Persian: Mardom), Leader (in Persian: Rahbar), and Our Iran (in Persian: Iran-e Maa), which were all supported by TPI at the time. By the time Naderpour graduated from high school in 1948, he had already left the Party. In fact, since 1946 Naderpour had been unhappy about the Iran-Azerbaijan crisis, and like many other nationalist students, he was convinced that Soviet communism could not make any provision for the independent nationalist communist movements in other countries. Subsequently, Naderpour worked wholeheartedly to ensure that Iran's parliamentary elections would be open, honest, and fair. He therefore became sympathetic to the National Front (in Persian: Jebheh-ye Melli) and its leader, Mohammad Mosaddegh, and other nationalist champions in those elections. In 1950 Naderpour was sent to Paris, France, to continue his education in French Language and Literature at the Sorbonne University. During his stay in Paris, he not only became a freelance writer for various publications but he also wrote for the Third Force Party (in Persian: Nirooy-e Sevvom), which Iranian ideologue and writer Khalil Maleki had established under the aegis of the National Front in Iran. After receiving his BA degree, Naderpour returned to Tehran and started working in the private sector. In 1960 Naderpour arranged the first modernist Persian poetry reading in Tehran, held at the Cultural Society of Iran & America (in Persian: Anjoman-e Farhangi-e Iran-o Amrika). Later, he worked as a consultant at the Office of Dramatic Arts of the Ministry of Arts and Culture (in Persian: Vezaarat-e Farhang-o Honar). He was also appointed as the Editor of Theater Magazine (in Persian: Majaleh-ye Namayesh), and as the Editor-in-Chief of the Monthly Journal of Art and People (in Persian: Honar-o Mardom). In 1964 Naderpour traveled to Europe. In Rome, he continued his studies on the Italian Language and Literature. He also spent some time in Paris, studying French cinema, and devoting time to his own poetry. In 1968, Naderpour became one of the thirty or so founding members of the first Association of Writers of Iran (in Persian: Kaanoon-e Nevisandegaan-e Iran). He was also one of the signatories of its manifesto, along with several other famous Iranian writers and poets. When Jalal Al-e- Ahmad, the driving force behind the Association, died in 1969, the Association chose Naderpour to speak on its behalf at the interment ceremony. For two consecutive years Naderpour was elected as a member of the steering committee for the Association of Writers of Iran. Later on, in 1977, he decided not to participate in the rejuvenation of the Association due to differences of opinion. In 1971, Naderpour took over as the director of Contemporary Literature Department (in Persian: Gorooh-e Adab-e Emrooz) in the National Iranian Radio and Television, where he directed many programs on the life and works of contemporary literary figures. Naderpour fled the Iranian Revolution in 1980 for France and resided there until 1987. He was elected to France's Authors' Association, and participated in several conferences and gatherings. In 1987, he moved to California. During his residence in the United States, Naderpour gave several speeches and lectures at Harvard University, Georgetown University, UCLA, and UC Berkeley. Naderpour was considered as the first Iranian poet who opened up exciting vistas of the new Persian poetry, and he was regarded as one of the leaders of the movement for the New Poetry or She'r-e Now in Iran and among other Persian speaking nations like Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Pakistan. Left to Right: Nader Naderpour, with Simin Behbahani and Ali Limonadi in Los Angeles, 1999. ==Death== Naderpour died from a heart attack in his Los Angeles home on Friday 18 February 2000, at 11:00 AM. Visitors to the Los Angeles area often pay their respects to Naderpour by visiting his gravesite located at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery. Shortly after Naderpour died, his widow Jaleh Bassiri established the Naderpour Foundation in Los Angeles. The aim of the Naderpour Foundation is to promote cross-cultural studies and comparative approaches to East-West literary tradition by focusing on the late poet's legacy. ==Works== Naderpour is well known for his extensive research on Iran's contemporary poetry, and also his thorough, insightful analyses of Iranian poets (Hafez, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Mowlavi (Rumi), and others). In addition, he is recognized for his perceptive commentaries on Iran's recent history and his astute observations on Iranians' cultural and political challenges. Naderpour published his first poems in the 1940s and completed four collections by the 1970s. His poems have been translated into English, French, German, and Italian. Here is the list of his publications: *Eyes and Hands (in Persian: Cheshm-haa-o Dast-haa): (1954) *Daughter of the Cup (in Persian: Dokhtar-e Jaam): (1955) *The Grape Poem (in Persian: Sher-e Angoor): (1958) *Collyrium of the Sun (in Persian: Sormeh-ye Khorsheed): (1960) *Not Plant and Stone, but Fire (in Persian: Giaah-o Sang Nah, Aatash): (1978) *From the Sublime to the Ridiculous (in Persian: Az Aasemaan taa Rissmaan): (1978) *The Last Supper (in Persian: Shaam-e Baazpaseen): (1978) *False Dawn (in Persian: Sobh-e Drooghin): (1982) *Blood and Ash (in Persian: Khoon-o Khaakestar): (1989) *Earth and Time (in Persian: Zamin-o Zaman): (1996) publisher, Ketab corp., Los Angeles, California *Collected poems (in Persian: Majmooeh-ye Ash'aar) (2003) publisher, Ketab corp., Los Angeles, California *Selected poems on audio CD ‚Äì recited by the poet (1998) (in Persian: Peyvand) publisher, Ketab corp., Los Angeles, California In the introduction to his tenth and last collection of poems, Earth and Time, Naderpour noted that, > Poems come from ‚ÄúHeaven‚Äù and remain alien on ‚ÄúEarth‚Äù; instead of ‚Äúplace‚Äù > they deal with ‚Äúnature‚Äù and instead of ‚Äútime‚Äù they deal with ‚Äúhistory‚Äù. A > poet who leaves his country and migrates to an alien land talks about his > new home in terms of his original homeland. With his words he pictures the > nature of his homeland, and instead of speaking of the ‚Äúpast‚Äù or the > ‚Äúfuture,‚Äù he links ‚Äúhistory‚Äù with ‚Äúeternity\\". For an exiled poet the images > of his homeland will always stay alive, but the homeland‚Äôs history, as well > as its present, will be (for him) ‚Äúeternity‚Äù. The poems composed by Naderpour are rich in imagery and deeply embedded in the texture of the Persian language. Naderpour was an imagist and a wordsmith in one, and he ultimately was a classic poet living in a modern world, in a modern style. Naderpour also published a large number of scholarly and research papers on Iran's politics, culture, history, and literature in various print journals and magazines such as Iran-Shenasi, Mehregan, Sokhan, and Rahavard as well as in many different online journals. Naderpour was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature and was awarded the Human Rights Watch Hellman-Hammett Grant in 1993. The grant is mostly awarded to the writers in exile whose works are banned in their own homelands. ==Samples== Here are some samples of poems composed by Naderpour and translated into English by Farhad Mafie and Manouchehr Saadat Noury: The Winter Homily :‚ÄúO, the fire that flames from inside the night :rises to dance, :but turns to stone by morning :O, the memory of the earth‚Äôs seething anger :in the days when the sky‚Äôs rage was spreading. :O, the sense of pride :O, the point where epics begin and end :O, the magnificent summit of old epics :O, the house of Ghobad! :O, the stony nest, the destiny of the phoenix :O, the land of Zal the Champion‚Äôs childhood.‚Äù ::Farhad Mafie (Los Angeles, 2000). Awareness :‚ÄúIn the midst of the battle, we understood :The words were not able and never could :Get the job done as it really should :And seize a very great raiding road.‚Äù ::Manouchehr Saadat Noury (Montreal, 2006). The Persian version of the above poem by Naderpour reads as follows: :Maa dar miyaan-e mahlekeh daanestim :Kaz vajeh kaar vijeh nemi-aayad :In harbeh raa tavaan-e tahaajom nist. ==Remarks== Here are the various remarks about Naderpour and his poetry as cited by some Iranian scholars and researchers: ‚ÄúIn my opinion, Naderpour‚Äôs poems are lasting poems. Undoubtedly, his works will be counted among the classics in the Persian language. In the last twenty years we owe thanks to Naderpour for many expressions that have now become popular and universal, such as the sadness of exile, being cut from our own roots, disheartened by the homeland that is being traumatized. In addition, he has given life to his poems through his beautiful descriptions, and through new, effective explanations he has made apparent to us the ambiguous, complex conditions of our own hidden conscience. His poem is the poem of our sadness, our worries, our hopes, and our disappointments‚Äù: Ehsan Yarshater (2001). According to Iraj Bashiri (2008), ‚ÄúNaderpour supported the three principles established by Nima. First, he believed that like natural or conversational speech, poetry must convey the meaning; the number of words as well as the simplicity or complexity of the phraseology must be dictated by the requirement of the expression of the thought being expressed. In other words, he believed that the phrases expressing single thoughts do not have to be of the same length. Secondly rhythm, Naderpour believed, need not follow an established, monotonous form. Rather, like natural speech, it should be allowed to vary depending on the requirements of the thought structure being expressed. Thirdly, rhyme must appear at the end of each completed thought pattern. Rather than forced on thought segments, Naderpour believed, rhyme must serve as a unifier; it must join complete thought segments and present them as a cohesive expression of the poet's sentiments‚Äù. His poem, \\"Man with Two Shadows\\" is a good example of this, especially regarding his use of shadow, its intransigence vis-a-vis the sun and its profoundity vis-a-vis the night: \\"A Man with Two Shadows\\" by Nader Naderpur, translated by Iraj Bashiri: :Standing amid a cold global sunset, :my shadow is cast :by the burning evening sun :which has, in turn, :gradually but carefully, :pulled it away :from beneath the feet of the mid-day sun. :But this elongated shadow :is not the creature that has :accompanied me from dawn to dusk :the creature that has led me from childhood to senility :that shadow was born to the morning light :this shadow is sired by the evening glow. :One day, when suddenly, :through the frame of my bright adolescence window :I discovered \\"future,\\" :golden and glowing, :that shadow, too, was born with the light :alongside that future :prepared to climb to the peak :I hurried from peak to peak :I rode, I felt, while :the rest of the world walked beside me. :But the appearance of noon :like light to which a film is exposed :destroyed my morning dreams of \\"future\\" :it destroyed all the shadows that graced the earth :the shadow that had accompanied me :(the shadow that had perished by the warmth of the sun) :that shadow alone was revived :and now, :in the fleeting sunlight of my life :standing amid the mud, it waits for the night :its face to the \\"past,\\" its back is to the \\"future.\\" ‚ÄúNaderpour loved to talk about what was going on in Iran as long as you could talk on the same level\\": Farhad Mafie (2000). \\"Naderpour made it very easy and approachable for younger people who've been away from their culture. His death was the perfect definition of a tragedy\\": Parastoo Izad Seta (2000) ==References== * * * ==External links== *Site dedicated to this poet *Some of Naderpour's poetry *Tribute website *Interview with Nader Naderpour (Voice of American Persian Service) *Information on the Naderpour Foundation Category:Iranian male poets Category:University of Paris alumni Category:1929 births Category:2000 deaths Category:Burials at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery Category:20th- century Iranian poets Category:Pan-Iranist Party politicians Category:Tudeh Party of Iran members Category:20th-century male writers ","title":"Nader Naderpour"},{"id":"3255491","text":"urban district Standish-with-Langtree was, and to a limited extent remains, a local government district centred on Standish, Lancashire, in North West England.

It is located from Hamworthy railway station and from Bournemouth International Airport. The ward had a population of 10,303 at the 2011 Census, increasing from 10,256 at the 2001 Census. Since 1840, Broadstone has grown from a small farm to a suburb of 10,000 people. Centred on the main road (the B3074), 'The Broadway' is a busy hub of shops, churches, schools and housing. The shops consist of Costa Coffee, Bennett's Bakery, Charity shops, a Tesco Express store, a Marks and Spencer‚Äôs supermarket, and a jewellery. Broadstone is notable for its large recreation fields and heathland park, as well as an annual Christmas parade and lights. The Broadstone Heath possesses some of the original heathland which covered the Poole Basin. ==History== In 1840, \\"Broadstone Farm\\" was built, and a railway line bypassed it in 1847. Its first church was built in 1853, which later became the Scout hall. The first railway station was built in 1872 and named \\"New Poole Junction\\" and, after several name revisions, became \\"Broadstone\\" in 1890. Broadstone First School originated as a Dame school, founded in 1871. At the turn of the century, lavender oil started being produced. This ceased in 1935 when the factory burnt down, but much lavender can still be found in the area. Rapid expansion of the town has since occurred, with the development of the Pine Springs housing estate and the opening of additional schools to cope with the increase in population. ==Toponymy== Legend has it that a number of \\"broad stones\\" were laid across a local stream to enable people to cross over without wetting their feet. This stream flows in the valley between Clarendon Road and Springdale Road, and the stones were located close to the Brookdale Farm. The Stepping Stones pub (now renamed 'The Blackwater Stream' since its takeover by Wetherspoon) was named in honour of this, and displays a large stone outside its beer garden. Rumoured to be the original, it was stolen decades ago and has since been replaced by a replica. There are also two stones outside Broadstone United Reformed Church, supposedly also originals from the stream. ==Notable residents== Wallace's grave in Broadstone Cemetery The Victorian biologist, naturalist and philosopher Alfred Russel Wallace, who independently proposed the same evolutionary theory as Charles Darwin, lived in Broadstone during the last few years of his life. He built his own house, named Old Orchard, near what is now Wallace Road. His remains are buried in Broadstone Cemetery, next to those of his wife, Annie. His grave was restored by the A. R. Wallace Memorial Fund in 2000. It features a tall fossil tree trunk mounted on a block of Purbeck limestone. Annette Brooke, a Liberal Democrat MP for Mid-Dorset and North Poole from 2001, currently resides in Broadstone. Bryan Telfer, a commodore in the Royal Navy and veteran of the Falklands War is buried in Broadstone Cemetery. Victor Watkins who lived in Broadstone was the first Scout in England to gain the Kings Scout Award (now the Queens Scout Award) and a Blue Plaque has now been unveiled on the wall outside the 29029 Nepalese Restaurant on Lower Blandford Road. Martin Smith, five-time British Powerlifting champion, European and Commonwealth powerlifting medallist also resides in Broadstone. Stuart Hibberd, the chief announcer of the BBC (or \\"voice of the BBC\\") for 25 years who announced the deaths of King George V and Adolf Hitler, died in Broadstone in 1983. ==Education== Broadstone follows the Three-tier education model and contains two First schools (Broadstone First and Springdale First) and a middle school (Broadstone Middle School). Corfe Hills School is also located in Broadstone and is one of the largest secondary schools in Dorset. Corfe Hills School moved from being a Foundation School to being an Academy on 1 April 2011.http://www.corfehills.net/academy-status/43.html Its catchment area serves Broadstone, Poole, Corfe Mullen, Wimborne, Merley as well as other areas. ==Clubs and associations== Broadstone is the centre of many clubs, societies and organisations for the South East Dorset area including The Lytchett archery club, Broadstone Football Club, the Broadstone Golf Club, Broadstone Horticultural society, Broadstone Tennis Society, Dorset Caledonian Society, Broadstone Scout Group, Broadstone Youth Centre and the Broadstone Cricket Club.

The e-mail claimed that the recipient had been caught visiting illegal websites, and asked the user to open an attachment to answer some questions. Once the infected attachment was opened a variety of system-damaging events occurred: anti-virus and other security measures were disabled, as well as the ability to access websites for assistance; furthermore, contacts in the user's address book were sent an identical e-mail. It is also suspected that Sober.X functions as spyware by stealing personal information about the infected user. MessageLabs, a computer security company, caught at least three million copies within 24 hours after the breakout, and McAfee, another system security research firm, reported over 70,000 cases of the virus on consumer computers. A similar e-mail circulated in Germany. Claiming to be sent by the Bundeskriminalamt, the e-mail told its readers that they were caught downloading \\"pirated\\" software. Sober.X was included in an attachment. ==Political motivations== In May 2005, the variant Sober.Q appeared. Whereas previous variants appeared to be motivated by commercial gain or by malicious intent, this was the first to seem politically motivated. Other variants (such as Sober.B) sent e-mails with subject headers also indicated political intent, but these seemed to be designed to arouse the victim's interest, so that he or she would open the e-mail's attachment. Sober.Q does not send e-mails with attachments, instead preferring links to web sites with no viruses. Sober.Q spread on computers to send messages of support for far-right groups in Germany pending the local elections in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Most appeared to be in support of, or directly from the German political party NPD (Nationalist Party of Germany) with links to their website, as well as other forum entries. It is, however, unknown whether this virus originated from the NPD themselves, supporters of the party, a hacker group trying to place the blame on the party or a group attempting to discredit the party. Similar to the above incident, the Sober virus was used again in 2005 by an unidentified German group to send out a widespread distribution of links to various political articles and commentaries.German political spam spread by virus, By Bob Sullivan, NBC News, 5/16/05.

The other colourists were John Duncan Fergusson, Francis Cadell and Leslie Hunter. ==Biography== A Rocky Shore, Iona by Samuel Peploe Still life: apples and jar, circa 1912‚Äì16, Art Gallery of New South Wales Peploe grave, Dean Cemetery Born in Edinburgh at 39 Manor Place,Meet the West Enders: Edinburgh World Heritage publications he was the son of a bank manager, Robert Luff Peploe (1828‚Äì1884) Grave inscription: Dean Cemetery He studied at the Royal Scottish Academy schools from 1893 to 1894, and then at the Acad√©mie Julian and Acad√©mie Colarossi in Paris, where he shared a room with Robert Brough. He visited the Netherlands in 1895, returning with reproductions of work by Rembrandt and Frans Hals. From 1901, he undertook painting trips to northern France and the Hebrides with his friend J. D. Fergusson, another of the Scottish Colourists. Inspired by the bright sunlight, he experimented with the bold use of colour, and the influence of the rustic realism of French painters is evident in his landscapes. In 1910 Peploe married Margaret MacKay (1873‚Äì1958), whom he had known since 1894. He also moved to Paris in 1910, a period which saw him concentrate increasingly on still life and landscape painting. His still-life works show the influence of Manet, with combinations of fluid brushwork, thick impasto and dark backgrounds with strong lighting. Returning to Scotland in 1912 he found that his usual dealer refused his work and he was obliged to stage his own exhibition.Biography and works at Portland Gallery , accessed December 2012 Peploe went on regular painting trips with friends to many parts of the country, and during the 1920s he spent several summers with Francis Cadell, another Scottish Colourist, painting in Iona. Peploe was strongly influenced by French painting throughout his life. Although his work never became overly abstract, it was notable for its use of strong colour, tight composition, and meticulous execution. Influences are said to include de Segonzac, C√©zanne, Matisse and Van Gogh. He died in Edinburgh in 1935. Peploe's younger son Denis followed his father's career. He is buried in the family plot in Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh. His name is listed near the end of several names on a stone to the north side of the main east‚Äìwest path, towards the west end. ==Legacy== Peploe's 1905 painting Still Life with Coffee Pot, sold on 26 May 2011 at Christie's in London for ¬£937,250, is one of the most expensive Scottish paintings sold at auction ‚Äì the most expensive being Peter Doig's White Canoe which sold for 11 million. The previous record for a work by Peploe was ¬£623,650 for Tulips, sold in 2010.¬£1m coffee pot smashes art record, Scotsman.com, 26 May 2011, accessed December 2012 In October 2012, the Peploe painting Pink Roses sold for ¬£225,000. The painting had been relegated to a spare room because the owner's wife did not like it. Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery holds the largest collection of Peploe's paintings aside from the National Galleries of Scotland. ==In fiction== A painting which might or might not be by Peploe (the question is only resolved at the end of the book) plays a central role in the novel 44 Scotland Street by the Scottish writer Alexander McCall Smith where a grandson of the painter makes a brief appearance. A Peploe painting also plays a small role in the novel Winter Solstice by Rosamunde Pilcher. A Peploe painting is mentioned as an item for sale by an auction house in The Quaker by Liam McIlvanney. ==ReferencesWorks in the Aberdeen Art Gallery * Exhibition of paintings by S.J.

The mortuary temple is located on the Western bank of the Nile river, across from the Eastern bank city of Luxor (Kozloff and Bryan). During its time, the Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III was the largest funerary complex in Thebes that was built (Kozloff and Bryan). Currently, only parts of the mortuary temple's layout remains, as well as the Colossi of Memnon, which are two large stone statues placed at the entrance measuring 18 meters (59 feet) high (Wilkinson). Because the mortuary temple was built relatively close to the river, the annual flooding caused the site to decay at a more rapid rate over time. The Colossi of Memnon and Amenhotep III Temple Project have helped conserve the site as well as possible (Sourouzian-Third Report). ==Excavation history== Dr. Hourig Sourouzian was the main excavator in the early 2000s and the site was visited by Dr. Zahi Hawass, although the mortuary temple was previously excavated in the late 1900s as well. Laurent Bavay examined the pottery found at the site from the 1999-2002 excavation seasons. The Hypostyle Hall was cleared by Myriam Seco √Ålvarez. (Sourouzian-Third Report) ==Temple layout== 200px The temple faced to the East, which is most likely due to the sun rising in the East, since Amenhotep III revered the sun god Amun. At the front of the mortuary temple, the Colossi of Memnon can be found, and as one enters, the long Hypostyle Hall leads to the Peristyle Sun Court, and the whole area is surrounded by three pylons, also known as gates (Sourouzian-Third Report). The Sun court is divided into the North and South halves and consisted of statues of both Amenhotep III and the gods. The North side had statues made of brown quartzite from Lower Egypt, while the South side had red granite from Aswan in Upper Egypt (Kozloff). ===Major findings and their significance=== View of the site in 2014 Some of the pottery examined by Laurent Bavay were ring-based cups, beer jars, and wine amphorae, which were mainly found in the Peristyle Sun Court and Third Pylon (Sourouzian-Third Report). Some stelae were found at the entrance of the Sun Court, which may have described the pharaoh's building accomplishments. There are hundreds of freestanding statues, sphinxes, and massive stelae throughout the mortuary temple. Some of these include: numerous statues of Sekhmet (lion-headed goddess), animals (such as lion-crocodile sphinx, jackals, scarabs beetles, and a white hippopotamus), Egyptian gods, and Amenhotep III as a god (Kozloff). Dr. Betsy Brian suggests that Amenhotep III may have organized the animal and Sekhmet statues into maps of the heavens, therefore bringing the heavens to Earth (Kozloff). As for the white hippopotamus, archaeologists are unsure of what it represents since there are no written documents or evidence that suggest its purpose, although some have guessed that it was used as some form of ritual (Sourouzian-Fourth Report). Some Sekhmet statues are standing, some are sitting, while some are holding a papyrus scepter on left hand, and the symbol of life on the right hand. Why are there hundreds of Sekhmet statues? Jean Yoyotte suggests that the goddess Sekhmet is given importance because not only is she the \\"mistress of drunkenness\\", but she provides healing qualities, which are meant to cure any illnesses of Amenhotep III. Also, she played an important role in the royal jubilee in order to \\"protect the sun-king against the enemies of the sun\\" (Sourouzian-Fourth Report). Crocodile sphinx seen from the road Having building materials from both Upper and Lower Egypt was a way Amenhotep III established sema-tawy (unification) of both lands. He also establishes Maat (justice and peace) over Islet (chaos) by having the statues of fauna, and therefore having control over them, as well as having depictions of bounded Egyptian enemies (such as the Nubian, Asiatics, Mesopotamians, Aegeans, Hittites, etc.) by some of the many statues of himself. The whole temple also symbolizes a mound and the \\"emergence of the world from the primeval waters of creation\\" every time the Nile river flooded the temple, since the Egyptians believed that the Earth was formed by a mound emerging from the water (Wilkinson). Amenhotep III wanted to be revered as a god on Earth, not just in the afterlife once he is dead. He builds this enormous mortuary temple to leave a legacy that he was a living god who ruled on Earth. ==The Temple's future== Dr. Zahi Hawass, Mansour Boraik, Ali el-Asfar and Ibrahim Soliman want to bring back the artifacts and findings from the Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III to the original site, since they are dispersed in different museums. They hope to form an open-air museum and to eventually bring awareness of the importance of on-site conservation. ==See also== *Colossal quartzite statue of Amenhotep III Found at the Mortuary Temple *Medinet Habu (Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III) ==References== * Kozloff, Amenhotep III: Egypt's Radiant Pharaoh. 2012. * Kozloff and Bryan, Egypt's Dazzling Sun: Amenhotep III and his World. 1992. * Sourouzian, Hourig, Rainer Stadelmann, Myriam Seco √Ålvarez, Josef Dorner, Nairy Hampikian, and Ibrahim Noureddine 2007.

Broadleaf plantain is not related to the fruit also known as plantain, which is a kind of banana. ==Description== Plantago major is an herbaceous perennial plant with a rosette of leaves in diameter.Blamey, M. & Grey-Wilson, C. (1989). Flora of Britain and Northern Europe. Each leaf is oval-shaped, long and broad, rarely up to long and broad, with an acute apex, a smooth margin, and a distinct petiole almost as long as the leaf itself. There are five to nine conspicuous veins over the length of the leaf.Parnell, J. and Curtis, T. 2012. Webb's An Irish Flora. Cork University Press. The flowers are small, greenish-brown with purple stamens, produced in a dense spike long on top of a stem tall and rarely to tall. Plantain is wind-pollinated, and propagates primarily by seeds, which are held on the long, narrow spikes which rise well above the foliage. Each plant can produce up to 20,000 seeds, which are very small and oval-shaped, with a bitter taste. There are three subspecies: *Plantago major subsp. major. *Plantago major subsp. intermedia (DC.) Arcang. *Plantago major subsp. winteri (Wirtg.) W.Ludw. File:Broadleaf Plantain (Plantago major) growing in crack in sidewalk.JPGPlantago major is notable for its ability to colonize compacted and disturbed soils, and to survive repeated trampling. File:Plantago major 05 ies.jpgDeveloping fruits of Plantago major File:Purple Plantago major.JPGCultivar 'Rubrifolia' of Plantago major ==Ecology== Plantago major grows in lawns and fields, along roadsides, and in other areas that have been disturbed by humans. It does particularly well in compacted or disturbed soils. It is believed to be one of the first plants to reach North America after European colonisation. Reportedly brought to the Americas by Puritan colonizers, plantain was known among some Native American peoples by the common name \\"white man's footprint\\", because it thrived in the disturbed and damaged ecosystems surrounding European settlements. The ability of plantain to survive frequent trampling and colonize compacted soils makes it important for soil rehabilitation. Its roots break up hardpan surfaces, while simultaneously holding together the soil to prevent erosion. The seeds of plantain are a common contaminant in cereal grain and other crop seeds. As a result, it now has a worldwide distribution. ==Uses== The mature plant contains pliable and tough fibres that can be used in survival situations to make small cords, fishing line, sutures, or braiding. Some cultivars are planted as ornamentals in gardens, including 'Rubrifolia' with purple leaves, and 'Variegata' with variegated leaves.Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. ===Edibility=== The leaves are edible as a salad green when young and tender, but they quickly become tough and fibrous as they get older. The older leaves can be cooked in stews. The leaves contain calcium and other minerals, and 100 grams of plantain contain approximately the same amount of beta-carotene as a large carrot. The seeds are so small that they are tedious to gather, but they can be ground into a flour substitute or extender. ===Herbal medicine=== Plantain contains the phytochemicals allantoin, aucubin, ursolic acid, flavonoids, and asperuloside. Plantain extract has been studied for its potential health effects. Plantain leaves were used commonly in folk medicine for skin poultices on wounds, sores, or insect stings. The root was used for fever and respiratory infections. ==References== major Category:Flora of Europe Category:Demulcents Category:Medicinal plants Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Category:Leaf vegetables ","title":"Plantago major"},{"id":"3255656","text":"Sid Chaplin (20 September 191611 January 1986) was an English writer whose works (novels, television screenplays, poetry and short stories) are mostly set in the North East England of the 1940s and 1950s. ==Biography== Chaplin was born into a Durham mining family and worked in pits as a teenager.http://www.ncl.ac.uk/library/special-collections/exhibitions/current- and-past-exhibitions/chaplin/ Between 1941 and 1953, he resided at Ferryhill, County Durhamhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-37466143 and worked as a miner at Dean and Chapter Colliery at Dean Bank.

Volunteer resources are harnessed through Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) platform. In 1999, the Space Sciences Laboratory launched SETI@home, which would rely on massively parallel computation on desktop computers scattered around the world. SETI@home utilizes recorded data from the Arecibo radio telescope and searches for narrow-bandwidth radio signals from space, signifying the presence of extraterrestrial technology. It was soon recognized that this same data might be scoured for other signals of value to the astronomy and physics community. == Development == For about 6 years, Astropulse existed in an experimental beta testing phase not available to the general community. In July 2008, Astropulse was integrated into SETI@home, so that the massive network of SETI participants could also contribute to the search for other astronomical signals of value. Astropulse also makes contributions to the search for ET: first, project proponents believe it may identify a different type of ET signal not identified by the original SETI@Home algorithm; second, proponents believe it may create additional support for SETI by providing a second possible concrete result from the overall search project. Final development of Astropulse has been a two-part endeavor. The first step was to complete the Astropulse C++ core that can successfully identify a target pulse. Upon completion of that program, the team created a trial dataset that contained a hidden pulse, which the completed program successfully found, thus confirming the ability of the Astropulse core to successfully identify target pulses. Since July 2008, research has focused on a series of refinements to the Beta version which are then rolled out to the full universe of SETI participants. At the programming level, developers first seek to assure that new versions are compatible with a variety of platforms, after which the refined version is optimized for greater speed. As of April, 2009, Astropulse is testing Beta version 5.05. The future of the project depends on extended funding to SETI@home. The BOINC idea is to divide (split) large blocks of data into smaller units, each of which can be distributed to individual participating work stations. To this end, the project then began to embed the Astropulse core into the SETI beta client and began to distribute real data, split into Astropulse work units, to a team of beta testers. The challenge has been to assure that the Astropulse core will work seamlessly on a broad array of operating systems. Current research focuses on implementing algorithm refinements that eliminate or reduce false positives. ==Scientific research== Astropulse searches for both single pulses and regularly repeating pulses. This experiment represents a new strategy for SETI, postulating microsecond timescale pulses as opposed to longer pulses or narrowband signals. They may also discover pulsars and exploding primordial black holes, both of which would emit brief wideband pulses. The primary purpose of the core Astropulse algorithm is coherent de-dispersion of the microsecond radio pulses for which Astropulse is searching. Dispersion of a signal occurs as the pulse passes through the interstellar medium (ISM) plasma, because the high frequency radiation goes slightly faster than the lower frequency radiation. Thus, the signal arrives at the radio-telescope dispersed depending upon the amount of ISM plasma between the Earth and the source of the pulse. Dedispersion is computationally intensive, thus lending itself to the distributed computing model. Astropulse utilizes the distributed computing power of SETI@home, delegating computational sub-tasks to hundreds of thousands of volunteers' computers, to gain advantages in sensitivity and time resolution over previous surveys. Wideband pulses would be \\"chirped\\" by passage through the interstellar medium; that is, high frequencies would arrive earlier and lower frequencies would arrive later. Thus, for pulses with wideband frequency content, dispersion hints at a signal's extraterrestrial origin. Astropulse searches for pulses with dispersion measures ranging from to (chirp rates of to per microsecond), allowing detection of sources almost anywhere within the Milky Way. Project proponents believe that Astropulse will either detect exploding black holes, or establish a maximum rate of , a factor of 104 better than any previous survey. ===Challenges=== Any radio astronomy project confronts issues arising from interference, and the challenges are especially great when the target signals are weak or of transient duration. Military radar noise which is regularly occurring and of known duration can be \\"blanked\\" at the radio telescope source. A variety of techniques have been explored in the literature to develop algorithms that detect and account for radar sources that cannot be blanked in this way. ===Results=== Astropulse started computing in mid-July 2008. , the results have been used in a variety of ways. Development staff, aided by volunteers, have worked to assure that the client works effectively on a broad array of operating systems. Code has been refined and optimized to reduce calculation time on the local work station. Results have been analyzed so that the algorithms can be adjusted to reduce false positives that may result from interference or from random background noise. To date, a target signal has not yet been found. == Potential pulse finds == One goal of Astropulse is to detect postulated mini black holes that might be evaporating due to \\"Hawking radiation\\". Such mini black holes are postulated to have been created during the Big Bang, unlike currently known black holes. The Astropulse project hopes that this evaporation would produce radio waves that Astropulse can detect. The evaporation wouldn't create radio waves directly. Instead, it would create an expanding fireball of high-energy gamma rays and particles. This fireball would interact with the surrounding magnetic field, pushing it out and generating radio waves. Rotating radio transients (RRATs) are a type of neutron stars discovered in 2006 by a team led by Maura McLaughlin from the Jodrell Bank Observatory at the University of Manchester in the UK. RRATs are believed to produce radio emissions which are very difficult to locate, because of their transient nature. Early efforts have been able to detect radio emissions (sometimes called RRAT flashes) for less than one second a day, and, like with other single-burst signals, one must take great care to distinguish them from terrestrial radio interference. Distributing computing and the Astropulse algorithm may thus lend itself to further detection of RRATs. Pulses with an apparent extragalactic origin have been observed in archived data. It is suggested that hundreds of similar events could occur every day and, if detected, could serve as cosmological probes. Radio pulsar surveys such as Astropulse-SETI@home offer one of the few opportunities to monitor the radio sky for impulsive burst-like events with millisecond durations. Because of the isolated nature of the observed phenomenon, the nature of the source remains speculative. Possibilities include a black hole- neutron star collision, a neutron star-neutron star collision, a black hole- black hole collision, or some phenomenon not yet considered. However, in 2010 there was a new report of 16 similar pulses from the Parkes Telescope which were clearly of terrestrial origin. Previous searches by SETI@home have looked for extraterrestrial communications in the form of narrow-band signals, analogous to our own radio stations. The Astropulse project argues that since we know nothing about how ET might communicate, this might be a bit closed- minded. Thus, the Astropulse survey can be viewed as supplementing the narrow- band SETI@home survey as a by-product of the search for physical phenomena. RF radiation from outer space was first discovered by Karl G. Jansky (1905‚Äì1950), who worked as a radio engineer at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to studying radio frequency interference from thunderstorms for Bell Laboratories. He found \\"...a steady hiss type static of unknown origin\\", which eventually he concluded had an extraterrestrial origin. Pulsars (rotating neutron stars) and quasars (dense central cores of extremely distant galaxies) were both discovered by radio astronomers. In 2003 astronomers using the Parkes radio telescope discovered two pulsars orbiting each other, the first such system known. Explaining their recent discovery of a powerful bursting radio source, NRL astronomer Dr. Joseph Lazio stated: \\"Amazingly, even though the sky is known to be full of transient objects emitting at X- and gamma-ray wavelengths, very little has been done to look for radio bursts, which are often easier for astronomical objects to produce.\\" The use of coherent dedispersion algorithms and the computing power provided by the SETI network may lead to discovery of previously undiscovered phenomena. == Astronomy in the schools == Astropulse and its older partner, SETI@home, offer a concrete way for secondary school science teachers to involve their students with astronomy and computing. A number of schools maintain distributed computing class projects. ==References== ==External links== ===Related websites=== *Astropulse Science *Von Korff, Astropulse: A Search for Microsecond Transient Radio Signals Using Distributed Computing *Astropulse FAQ *Website *SETI@home forum thread about Astropulse *SETI@home Beta forum thread about Astropulse *Astropulse Wiki *Electromagnetic Radiation *A multibeam sky survey ===For teachers and students=== *Ask an Astrophysicist ‚Äî black holes *Ask an Astrophysicist ‚Äî neutron stars and pulsars *Goddard Space Center's Teachers Corner *Basics of Radio Astronomy *SETI Science Links *Planetary Society Article Category:Free astronomy software Category:Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing projects ","title":"Astropulse"},{"id":"3255666","text":"Harper Road may refer to: * Harper Road, London, a road in south London, England * Harper Road, Singapore, a road in Singapore * Prince Edward Island Route 158, officially known as Harper Road ","title":"Harper Road"},{"id":"3255669","text":"Horsemen may refer to: *Horsemen, people who practise equestrianism *Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse *Four Horsemen (football) *Royal Canadian Mounted Police *Brooklyn Lions / Horsemen (1926), a National Football League team that played in the 1926 NFL season ==Films== *The Horsemen (1971 film), starring Omar Sharif *Horseman (film), 2003 Croatian drama film directed by Branko Ivanda *The Horseman (film), 2008 Australian thriller directed and written by Steven Kastrissios *Horsemen (film), 2009 American thriller film directed by Jonas √Ökerlund ==See also== *Horseman (disambiguation) *The Horsemen (disambiguation) ","title":"Horsemen"},{"id":"3255677","text":"Auckland Campbell Geddes, 1st Baron Geddes, (21 June 1879 ‚Äì 8 June 1954) was a British academic, soldier, politician and diplomat.

He was the brother of Sir Eric Campbell-Geddes, First Lord of the Admiralty during World War I and principal architect of the Geddes Axe, which led to the retrenchment of British public expenditure following the War. His sister was Dr. Mona Chalmers Watson, the first woman to graduate M.D. from the University of Edinburgh and the first Chief Controller of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps. ==Boer War== Geddes served in the Second Boer War in South Africa between 1901 and 1902 as a second lieutenant in the Highland Light Infantry. On 2 June 1902 he was promoted a lieutenant in the 3rd (Militia) battalion of the regiment, and he returned home with other men of this battalion on the SS Doune Castle in September 1902, after the war had ended two months earlier. ==Academic career== Geddes was educated at George Watson's College, in Edinburgh. He then studied Medicine at Edinburgh University graduating MB ChB in 1903. From 1906 to 1909, Geddes was an Assistant Professor of Anatomy at Edinburgh University. The university gave him his doctorate (MD) in 1908. In 1909 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. his proposers were William Turner (anatomist), Sir Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer, David Waterston and George Chrystal. From 1913 to 1914 he was a Professor of Anatomy at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. From 1913 to 1914, he was a Professor of Anatomy at McGill University. His academic career was interrupted by the First World War during which he served as a Brigadier General in the War Office. ==First World War== During the First World War he served as a Major in the 17th Northumberland Fusiliers and was on the staff of the General Headquarters in France as a Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel and Honorary Brigadier General.Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).

The gain‚Äìbandwidth product (designated as GBWP, GBW, GBP, or GB) for an amplifier is the product of the amplifier's bandwidth and the gain at which the bandwidth is measured. For devices such as operational amplifiers that are designed to have a simple one-pole frequency response, the gain‚Äìbandwidth product is nearly independent of the gain at which it is measured; in such devices the gain‚Äìbandwidth product will also be equal to the unity-gain bandwidth of the amplifier (the bandwidth within which the amplifier gain is at least 1). For an amplifier in which negative feedback reduces the gain to below the open-loop gain, the gain‚Äìbandwidth product of the closed-loop amplifier will be approximately equal to that of the open-loop amplifier. According to S. Srinivasan, \\"The parameter characterizing the frequency dependence of the operational amplifier gain is the finite gain‚Äìbandwidth product (GB).\\"Srinivasan, S. \\"A universal compensation scheme for active filters.\\" International Journal of Electronics 42.2 (Feb. 1977): 141. Science & Technology Collection. EBSCO. Dallas Public Library , Dallas, TX, USA. retrieved 31 July 2009 from . == Relevance to design == This quantity is commonly specified for operational amplifiers, and allows circuit designers to determine the maximum gain that can be extracted from the device for a given frequency (or bandwidth) and vice versa. When adding LC circuits to the input and output of an amplifier the gain rises and the bandwidth decreases, but the product is generally bounded by the gain‚Äìbandwidth product. === Examples === If the GBWP of an operational amplifier is 1 MHz, it means that the gain of the device falls to unity at 1 MHz. Hence, when the device is wired for unity gain, it will work up to 1 MHz (GBWP = gain √ó bandwidth, therefore if BW = 1 MHz, then gain = 1) without excessively distorting the signal. The same device when wired for a gain of 10 will work only up to 100 kHz, in accordance with the GBW product formula. Further, if the maximum frequency of operation is 1 Hz, then the maximum gain that can be extracted from the device is 1. We can also analytically show that for \\\\omega \\\\gg \\\\omega_c GBWP is constant. Let A_1(\\\\omega) be a first-order transfer function given by: A_1(\\\\omega)= \\\\frac{}{{\\\\sqrt {1 + {{\\\\left( {\\\\frac{\\\\omega }{}} \\\\right)}^2}} }} We will show that: GBWP_{\\\\omega \\\\gg {\\\\omega_c}} = {A_1}(\\\\omega )\\\\cdot\\\\omega \\\\approx const. Proof: We will expand A_1 using Taylor series and retain the constant and first term, to obtain: GBWP = {A_1}(\\\\omega )\\\\cdot\\\\omega = \\\\frac{}{{\\\\sqrt {1 + {{\\\\left( {\\\\frac{\\\\omega }{}} \\\\right)}^2}} }}\\\\cdot\\\\omega \\\\simeq \\\\frac{}{{\\\\sqrt {{{\\\\left( {\\\\frac{\\\\omega }{}} \\\\right)}^2}} }} {{ {{{\\\\left(\\\\omega- {\\\\frac{\\\\omega_c^2 }{}} \\\\right)}}} }} = {H_0}\\\\cdot{\\\\omega_c} \\\\left(1- \\\\frac{\\\\omega_c^2 }{2\\\\omega^2} \\\\right) = const. Example for \\\\omega = 5\\\\cdot \\\\omega_c GBWP = \\\\frac{}{{\\\\sqrt {\\\\frac{{\\\\omega_c^2 + 25{\\\\omega _c}^2}}} }}\\\\cdot5{\\\\omega_c} = \\\\frac{5}{{\\\\sqrt {26} }}{H_0}\\\\cdot{\\\\omega_c} = 0.98\\\\cdot{H_0}\\\\cdot{\\\\omega_c} Note that the error in this case is only about 2%, for the constant term, and using the second term, \\\\left(1- \\\\frac{\\\\omega_c^2 }{2\\\\omega^2} \\\\right) , the error drops to .06%. ==Transistors== For transistors, the current-gain‚Äìbandwidth product is known as the or transition frequency. It is calculated from the low-frequency (a few kilohertz) current gain under specified test conditions, and the cutoff frequency at which the current gain drops by 3 decibels (70% amplitude); the product of these two values can be thought of as the frequency at which the current gain would drop to 1, and the transistor current gain between the cutoff and transition frequency can be estimated by dividing by the frequency. Usually, transistors must be applied at frequencies well below to be useful as amplifiers and oscillators.Martin Hartley Jones A practical introduction to electronic circuits, Cambridge University Press, 1995 page 148 In a bipolar junction transistor, frequency response declines owing to the internal capacitance of the junctions. The transition frequency varies with collector current, reaching a maximum for some value and declining for greater or lesser collector current. == References == == External links == * \\"Op-amp gain- bandwidth-product\\" masteringelectronicsdesign.com Category:Electronic amplifiers ","title":"Gain‚Äìbandwidth product"},{"id":"3255704","text":"Queensbury and Shelf was an urban district in the West Riding of Yorkshire from 1937 to 1974.

Hematoxylin and eosin stain or haematoxylin and eosin stain (often abbreviated as: H&E; stain or HE stain) is one of the principal tissue stains used in histology. It is the most widely used stain in medical diagnosis and is often the gold standard. For example, when a pathologist looks at a biopsy of a suspected cancer, the histological section is likely to be stained with H&E.; H&E; is the combination of two histological stains: hematoxylin and eosin. The hematoxylin stains cell nuclei blue, and eosin stains the extracellular matrix and cytoplasm pink, with other structures taking on different shades, hues, and combinations of these colors. The stain shows the general layout and distribution of cells and provides a general overview of a tissue sample's structure. Hence a pathologist can easily differentiate between the nuclear and cytoplasmic parts of a cell. This stain combination was first introduced in 1876 by A. Wissowzsky. ==Uses== The H&E; staining procedure is the principal stain in histology in part because it can be done quickly, is not expensive, and stains tissues in such a way that a considerable amount of microscopic anatomy is revealed, and can be used to diagnose a wide range of histopathologic conditions. The results from H&E; staining are not overly dependent on the chemical used to fix the tissue or slight inconsistencies in laboratory protocol, and these factors contribute to its routine use in histology. H&E; staining does not always provide enough contrast to differentiate all tissues, cellular structures, or the distribution of chemical substances, and in these cases more specific stains and methods are used. ==Method of application== Rack of slides being removed from a bath of hematoxylin stain. There are many ways to prepare the hematoxylin solutions (formulation) used in the H&E; procedure, in addition, there are many laboratory protocols for producing H&E; stained slides, some of which may be specific to a certain laboratory. Although there is no standard procedure, the results by convention are reasonably consistent in that cell nuclei are stained blue and the cytoplasm and extracellular matrix are stained pink. Histology laboratories may also adjust the amount or type of staining for a particular pathologist. After tissues have been collected (often as biopsies) and fixed, they are typically dehydrated and embedded in melted paraffin wax, the resulting block is mounted on a microtome and cut into thin slices. The slices are affixed to microscope slides at which point the wax is removed with a solvent and the tissue slices attached to the slides are rehydrated and are ready for staining. Alternatively, H&E; stain is the most used stain in Mohs surgery in which tissues are typically frozen, cut on a cryostat (a microtome that cuts frozen tissue), fixed in alcohol, and then stained. The H&E; staining method involves application of haematoxylin mixed with a metallic salt, or mordant, often followed by a rinse in a weak acid solution to remove excess staining (differentiation), followed by bluing in mildly alkaline water. After the application of haematoxylin, the tissue is counterstained with eosin (most commonly eosin Y). ==Results== Hematoxylin principally colors the nuclei of cells blue or dark-purple, along with a few other tissues, such as keratohyalin granules and calcified material. Eosin stains the cytoplasm and some other structures including extracellular matrix such as collagen in up to five shades of pink. The eosinophilic (substances that are stained by eosin) structures are generally composed of intracellular or extracellular proteins. The Lewy bodies and Mallory bodies are examples of eosinophilic structures. Most of the cytoplasm is eosinophilic and is rendered pink. Red blood cells are stained intensely red. ==Mode of action== Although hematein, an oxidized form of hematoxylin, is the active colorant (when combined with a mordant), the stain is still referred to as hematoxylin. Hematoxylin, when combined with a mordant (most commonly aluminum alum) is often considered to \\"resemble\\" a basic, positively charged, or cationic stain. Eosin is an anionic (negatively charged) and acidic stain. The staining of nuclei by hemalum (a combination of aluminum ions and hematein) is ordinarily due to binding of the dye-metal complex to DNA, but nuclear staining can be obtained after extraction of DNA from tissue sections. The mechanism is different from that of nuclear staining by basic (cationic) dyes such as thionine or toluidine blue. Staining by basic dyes occurs only from solutions that are less acidic than hemalum, and it is prevented by prior chemical or enzymatic extraction of nucleic acids. There is evidence to indicate that co-ordinate bonds, similar to those that hold aluminium and hematein together, bind the hemalum complex to DNA and to carboxy groups of proteins in the nuclear chromatin. The structures do not have to be acidic or basic to be called basophilic and eosinophilic; the terminology is based on the affinity of cellular components for the dyes. Other colors, e.g. yellow and brown, can be present in the sample; they are caused by intrinsic pigments such as melanin. Basal laminae need to be stained by PAS stain or some silver stains, if they have to be well visible. Reticular fibers also require silver stain. Hydrophobic structures also tend to remain clear; these are usually rich in fats, e.g. adipocytes, myelin around neuron axons, and Golgi apparatus membranes. ==Examples of H&E; stained tissues== ==References== ==Further reading== * Kiernan JA (2008) Histological and Histochemical Methods: Theory and Practice. 4th ed.

Beaver Creek Chapel. View at the Beaver Creek Village. Beaver Creek Resort is a major ski resort in the western United States, near Avon, Colorado. The resort comprises three villages, the main Beaver Creek Village, Bachelor Gulch, and Arrowhead to the west. The resort is owned and operated by Vail Resorts which operates multiple additional resorts. Beaver Creek is a regular host of World Cup events, usually in early December. ==History== The valley that houses Beaver Creek Resort lies just south of Avon and was first settled in 1881. Many early pioneers moved to the area under President Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs Homestead Act (1862), farming hay and raising cattle to feed local miners. Beaver Creek remained a lightly populated farming area through the middle of the twentieth century. Beaver Creek Resort was envisioned in the 1950s by Earl Eaton, but it was not until the early 1970s that Pete Seibert tried to convince the Denver Organizing Committee to hold the 1976 Winter Olympics alpine events at the yet to be built ski resort. However, when Denver backed out from holding the Olympic Winter Games in November 1972, Seibert's plans of building the resort collapsed. When Vail Associates was purchased by Harry W. Bass Jr., an oil tycoon of Goliad Oil, he decided to develop Beaver Creek. The ski slope and first hotel property, The Charter at Beaver Creek, opened during the 1980‚Äì81 ski season. The resort had six chairlifts, all constructed by Doppelmayr: three triple and three double chairlifts. In 1983, Larkspur Bowl was opened with the addition of its own triple chairlift, accessible via the Strawberry Park region. In 1985, Bass sold Beaver Creek and Vail Associates filed for bankruptcy a few years later. In 1986, Beaver Creek entered the high speed lift market with the installation of the Centennial Express on the main mountain, replacing the Centennial triple chairlift. In 1989, the resort hosted the World Ski Championships, and repeated in 1999 and in 2015. In 1991, a new pod of advanced terrain was opened on Grouse Mountain in the Talons area, with Garaventa-CTEC constructing a high speed quad to service the new trails. CTEC would go on to install three more high speed quads during the 1990s, replacing the Strawberry Park triple in 1994 and the Stump Park triple on the main mountain with the Cinch Express in 1996. The former Strawberry Park triple was relocated and renamed Elkhorn, providing mountain access for real estate owners. In 1993, Beaver Creek purchased the small, adjacent Arrowhead Mountain, formerly an independent resort catering to the beginner and lower intermediate skier with its own Doppelmayr-constructed high speed quad. In 1997, the two resorts were connected through the addition of Bachelor Gulch Village and a new high speed quad, known as the Bachelor Gulch Express. For the 2003 season, Doppelmayr constructed a new high speed quad known as the Birds of Prey Express to replace the Westfall double chairlift, providing high speed lift service to the Birds of Prey downhill course. A year later, they built a pair of high speed quads in the Bachelor Gulch area to improve transiting from the Bachelor Gulch and Arrowhead region to Beaver Creek Mountain, as well as provide lift service from Avon. A year after that, they constructed the Larkspur Express to replace the Larkspur triple chairlift. In 2007, two new gondolas were opened. The Riverfront Express Gondola was constructed to connect Avon to the Beaver Creek Landing and the Lower Beaver Creek Mountain Express lift, while the Haymeadow Gondola was built to replace one of two double chairlifts in the Beaver Creek Village learning area. More improvements came in the 2011 season, as the Rose Bowl Express was constructed to replace the older triple chairlift. In 2014, massive changes occurred as Doppelmayr replaced the aging Centennial Express lift with a chondola, combining a high speed six pack with ten passenger gondola cabins. In 2017, the last of Beaver Creek's original opening day lifts, the Drink of Water double chairlift, was removed and replaced with a high speed quad. The Red Buffalo Express supplements the older Cinch Express, and reused towers from the defunct Montezuma Express at Keystone Resort. For the 2020-2021 season, a new beginner terrain pod was opened in McCoy Park, accessible from Larkspur Bowl and Strawberry Park, and serviced by its own high speed quad. For the last several years, Beaver Creek has hosted the Audi \\"Birds of Prey\\" World Cup downhill ski races early in the season. ==Beaver Creek Golf Course== The resort is known for its upscale family-oriented accommodations, terrain and a Robert Trent Jones, Jr. Golf Course. The Beaver Creek Golf Club, nestled against the slopes of Beaver Creek Mountain, is one of the longest established golf courses in the Vail Valley. Opened in 1982, the course is known for its long and narrow challenging fairways, and its stunning scenery. Recently, Beaver Creek has worked to re- shape all of the bunkers on the course, aligning them more closely with their original design, and in the process installing a new drainage system and new sand for better playability. Additionally, the clubhouse restaurant, formerly known as Holden's, has undergone a face lift and reopened as the Rendezvous Club. ==Workforce== The town hires extensively from the around the world to fill its large seasonal employee rosters. Vail Resorts (formerly Vail Associates) is the corporation that owns Beaver Creek. It also operates Breckenridge, Keystone, Heavenly, Vail Mountain, Kirkwood, Park City and Northstar at Tahoe. ==Holy Cross Wilderness Area== Beaver Creek Resort is adjacent to the Holy Cross Wilderness in White River National Forest. Beaver Lake Trail passes through Beaver Creek Resort, beside Beaver Creek. Beaver Lake Trail crosses the wilderness area boundary immediately before reaching Beaver Lake. Beyond Beaver Lake, Beaver Lake Trail ascends south to Turqoise Lakes and Grouse Mountain. ==Beaver Creek Resort statistics== ===Elevation=== *Base: *Summit: *Vertical Rise: ===Developed Terrain=== *Mountains: 5 (Beaver Creek, Grouse Mountain, Larkspur, Arrowhead Mountain, Bachelor Gulch) *Bowls: 2 (Rose Bowl, Larkspur Bowl) *Skiable Area: *Trails: 150 total (19% beginner, 43% intermediate, 38% expert/advanced) *Longest Run: Centennial *Terrain Parks: 2 *Average Snowfall: annually ===Slope Aspects=== *North: 55% *West: 20% *East: 25% ===Lifts=== As of 2019, Beaver Creek has 25 total chairlifts. 2 Gondolas *Haymeadow Express Gondola #1 *Riverfront Gondola #7 1 hybrid lift *Centennial Express #6 (cross between high speed six pack and ten person gondola) 11 high-speed quads *Rose Bowl Express #4 *Red Buffalo Express #5 *Cinch Express #8 *Birds of Prey Express #9 *Grouse Mountain Express #10 *Larkspur Express #11 *Strawberry Park Express #12 *Lower Beaver Creek Mountain Express #15 *Bachelor Gulch Express #16 *Arrow Bahn Express #17 *Upper Beaver Creek Mountain Express #18 1 triple chairlift *Elkhorn #14 1 double chair *Highlands #2 8 magic carpets ==References== ==External links== * *Official Beaver Creek Snow & Weather Report *Official Beaver Creek Trail Map *The Vail Resorts official website *3dSkiMap of Beaver Creek Ski Resort *Vail Valley Partnership - The Chamber & Tourism Bureau *White River National Forest (USDA Forest Service) Category:Buildings and structures in Eagle County, Colorado Category:Tourist attractions in Eagle County, Colorado Category:Ski areas and resorts in Colorado Category:Vail Resorts Category:Populated places established in 1980 Category:1980 establishments in Colorado ","title":"Beaver Creek Resort"},{"id":"3255729","text":"Garden Road may refer to: * Garden Road stop, the lower terminus of the Peak Tram line, Hong Kong * Garden Road, Hong Kong, on Hong Kong Island * Hankow Road, formerly Garden Road, in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong * \\"Garden Road\\", an unreleased song by Rush intended for inclusion on the 1974 album Rush ","title":"Garden Road"},{"id":"3255732","text":"Tunes of War is the seventh studio album by German metal band Grave Digger.

It is mostly within the present Leeds metropolitan borough, although some areas now in Bradford metropolitan district may also be considered to form part of Aireborough. It includes the settlements of Guiseley, Hawksworth, Menston, High Royds, Nether Yeadon, Rawdon, Yeadon, West Carlton, East Carlton and Esholt. The name Aireborough is used for a UK census ward, which was named \\"the most average place in England and Wales\\", following studies arising from the 2001 census. ==Etymology== The name Aireborough was first applied to a fictional and wealthy manufacturing town, in short stories written for newspapers of the late nineteenth century by Charles Darcy Friel, who lived and worked in Leeds, and died there in 1910. The name derives from the River Aire, which intersects the West Yorkshire Urban Area.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Names Society, 2017), p. 14. In 1936, the urban councils of Guiseley, Yeadon and Rawdon, along with smaller settlements belonging to Wharfedale Rural District, decided to form a new autonomous Urban District Council. While the area was similar to the former civil Parish of Guiseley, the name Aireborough was instead adopted ‚Äì to reflect the equality of all townships included in the district and \\"wipe out old jealousies, and concentrate more readily on the problems ahead, working together as a team\\". On 1 April 1937, the Urban District came into being. Aireborough Urban District was subsumed by Leeds metropolitan borough under the 1974 local government reorganisation.''' ==Physical characteristics== The area sits on the sandstone and millstone grit of the South Pennines, in a landscape shaped by human endeavour since ancient times. Water in the form of becks, tarns and wetlands, is a key natural resource, mostly draining towards the River Aire. Local stone features in the drystone walls and solid stone buildings ‚Äì as well as in the foundations of the Houses of Parliament. Whilst green-ways used for travelling to church, market, mill or dispersed farmsteads still cut across the town and landscape. ==History== The main townships of Guiseley, Rawdon and Yeadon grew into industrial textile and manufacturing townships from their medieval farming/weaving origins. The smaller areas of Nether Yeadon, Carlton, and Hawksworth still retain their pre-industrial character. Aireborough, in common with the South Pennines Heritage Area, was an important area for social developments such as: non-conformist religion (e.g. Quakers, Baptists and Methodists); co-operative movements and; 19th century philanthropists who donated public buildings and facilities, such as Jonathan Peate. Many of the mills made fabric or supported the textile industry for national companies such as Jaeger and Marks & Spencer. However, since 2000 most of the bigger industry has left, and Leeds Bradford International Airport, in Yeadon, is now one of the biggest employers. There are though still some successful quality textile firms such as Abraham Moon who have survived and thrived, and a range of smaller and medium size businesses who base themselves in the area to take advantage of the setting and the local skilled labour force. High Royds Hospital, a former psychiatric hospital at Menston, was redeveloped as housing at the beginning of the 21st century. The name Aireborough has been used by many official bodies or organisations. Yeadon and Guiseley Secondary School was renamed Aireborough Grammar School in 1937 (when the Urban District was formed) and retained the name until its closure in 1991 ‚Äì the names of the different townships emblazoned on the school frontage are now set into the stone wall opposite Nunroyd Park. In the UK Parliament, the constituency of Pudsey is sometimes known as \\"Pudsey, Horsforth and Aireborough\\". The Royal Mail has an Aireborough delivery office.

The racecourse is set in an area of parkland bounded by the towns of Haydock to the west, Ashton-in-Makerfield to the north, Golborne to the east and Newton- le-Willows to the south. Horse racing had been run in Newton for many years (the great racemare Queen of Trumps won at Newton in 1836), and the venue was also used for hare coursing in the 1880s. The current racecourse was opened in 1899. Much of the course's early development was overseen by Sydney Sandon, who served as course secretary, chairman and managing director in the early 20th century. ==Facilities== Haydock Park racecourse dress code The track is a mostly flat left-handed oval of around 1 mile 5 furlongs with a slight rise on the four and a half furlong run-in. An extension or \\"chute\\" to the straight allows sprints of up to six furlongs to be run on a straight course. There are courses for flat racing and National Hunt racing.

It was introduced in 1957 and distributed by Steineck's company Concava S.A and remained in production up to 1996. The Tessina takes 14x21 mm pictures on standard 35 mm film (loaded into a special cassette), making it one of the few subminiature cameras to use the format. It is a very small (2.5x2x1 inch) twin lens reflex, with two 25 mm f/2.8 Tessinon lenses, one for taking the picture, the other for viewing on a tiny ground-glass focusing screen on top of the camera. A 45¬∞ mirror is employed to bend incoming light onto the film, which lies along the bottom of the camera rather than the back to save space. Apertures are continuously variable down to f/22, and shutter speeds range from 1/2 to 1/500, and B. The Tessina 35, Tessina L can focus down to 9 inches, Tessina Automatic 35mm to 12 inches. The film is advanced via a clockwork master spring built into the takeup spool, with a pullout winder like the crown on a wristwatch. Each winding can last up to 8 exposures. Tessina is hand assembled from more than two hundred precision parts, it contains ruby bearing like swiss watch to reduce friction, each camera is designed for 100,000 pictures.

With this piece, the artist () pays tribute to Galicia's oral culture and the medieval poets and troubadours who, like Martin Codax, or Mendinho, celebrated the bounties of Vigo's sea. Mendinho, also Meendinho, Mendi√±o and Meendi√±o, was a medieval Iberian poet. Nothing is known about Mendinho except by inference. Scholars generally assume from the reference to the shrine of San Simi√≥n (in the modern Isle of San Sim√≥n, R√≠as Baixas of Vigo, Spain) that he was Galician. And it is supposed from his name (without any accompanying patronym or toponym), his style, and the place of his song in the manuscripts (the Cancioneiro da Vaticana, Vatican Library, and the Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional, Lisbon, Portugal) that he was a jogral - a non-noble Minstrel. Mendinho may have been active in the early 13th century, making him one of the earliest poets in this genre whose work has survived. A single cantiga de amigo (song about a boyfriend sung in the feminine) is attributed to him - Sedia-m' eu na ermida de San Simion, but it is among the most famous in the Galician-Portuguese lyric corpus of around 1685 texts. It has been admired for its imagery (critics say the girl is afraid of the waves of her own passion), its rhythm, and its formal and semantic parallelism (including the system of alternating strophes with the rhymes-sounds -on(or)/-ar). The text in the manuscripts is problematic in places, especially in the refrain, where the reading is much disputed. In 1998, the D√≠a das Letras Galegas (Galician Letters Day) was dedicated to Mendinho, along with Mart√≠n Codax and Xoh√°n de Cangas. His single known poem was set to music by Alain Oulman, the French composer and long term musical collaborator of the great Portuguese Fado singer Am√°lia Rodrigues. An English translation/adaptation of Sedia-m'eu na ermida... is contained in the longpoem The Tale of Tekarionyoken (2013) by Thomas M.

It is located along the East Bank of the Mississippi River, approximately 3.5 miles below the lower limit of New Orleans. The community, for governmental and postal address purposes, is considered part of Chalmette and by some designations, part of neighboring Meraux. As a place designation, the name \\"Versailles\\" continues in local use. ==History== Versailles was founded by Major-General Pierre Denis de la Ronde (1762-1824), one of Louisiana's wealthiest plantation owners and a descendant of French Canadian judge and poet, Ren√©-Louis Chartier de Lotbini√®re, of Maison Lotbini√®re, poet Alain Chartier and, traditionally, the explorer Jehan Denys, though this is unproven and is likely entirely the confabulation of Frederick Gilman Forsyth, the self-styled, so-called \\"Forsyth de Fronsac,\\" who published falsified lineages.The Aryan Order of America and the College of Arms of Canada, by Yves Drolet; Montreal, Canada; 2015, p. 45.\\" In 1802, Denis de La Ronde was appointed to Louisiana (New Spain)'s governing authority, the Cabildo, at the behest of his late brother-in-law, Andr√©s Almonaster y Rojas, to succeed him as Regidor Perpetuo, Councilman for Life. (Spanish bureaucratic offices were a form of property, purchased from the Crown, and could be inherited.) In 1805, during the U.S. territorial period, along with other local investors, he made plans to build Versailles along the Mississippi River and to then cut a barge canal through some dozen miles of swamp to the shore of Lake Pontchartrain, where they planned to build another town, to be called \\"Paris.\\" The intended communities were named after Paris and Versailles in France and were meant to recreate the French style. Denis de La Ronde envisioned that this Versailles would overtake New Orleans in size and popularity. However, development was waylaid by political unrest, culminating in the War of 1812. In 1814-15, then- Colonel de La Ronde commanded the Louisiana militia's Third Regiment at the Battle of New Orleans, which was fought both at his plantation (December 23, 1814, Night Battle)Pierre Denis de la Ronde, fils at the Dictionary of Louisiana Biography, retrieved 10 April 2017. and at the neighboring Chalmette plantation, belonging to his maternal half-brother, Ignace Martin de Lino de Chalmette (1755-1815). Like de La Ronde, de Lino was a descendant of the Chartier family, through his paternal grandmother. Their mutual niece, Micaela Almonester, Baroness de Pontalba, later constructed the Pontalba Buildings in New Orleans, during the 1840s, then, in 1855, completed the H√¥tel de Pontalba in Paris. All three are descendants of the famed French architect Ignace Fran√ßois Broutin. Versailles remained a small town for the rest of the 19th century, with no navigable canal linking the River and the Lake until the Industrial Canal was built in New Orleans during the 20th century. Denis de La Ronde's path through the swamps fared better, eventually developing into a major artery. Paris Road remains the farthest downriver route connecting the River to the Lake in Greater New Orleans. ==La Ronde Plantation== The house was considered the most stylish plantation home in that part of Louisiana at the time, and the name Versailles is mistakenly distributed by various authors and in reports‚Äîlargely from the misnaming of the La Ronde plantation in Old Families of Louisiana.Families of Louisiana, by Arthur, Stanley Clisby; Louisiana Historical Society; New Orleans, USA; 1905; p.396. Evidence has yet to materialize, however, that this mansion was ever referred to as \\"Versailles\\" in its time, or by its owners. The plantation was affectionately known as \\"Parnassus\\" to the family, a home \\"where lavish hospitality was dispensed.\\"Families of Louisiana, by Arthur, Stanley Clisby; Louisiana Historical Society; New Orleans, USA; 1905; p.397. Pierre Denis de La Ronde purchased the property in 1783.Robert W. Tebbs, Photographer to Architects: Louisiana Plantations in 1926, by Richard Anthony Lewis; Louisiana State University; USA; 2011, p. 29.\\" Then, to commemorate his 21st birthday, he had slaves plant an avenue of now-famous oak trees.The Regional Review, Volume II - No. 5: \\"Historic Sites in the South\\", by Roy Edgar Appleman, Regional Supervisor of Historic Sites; Richmond, Virginia; USA; May, 1939. The all√©e still stands, largely intact, as the La Ronde Oaks‚Äîthough the trees, like the mansion they once led to from the Mississippi, are also widely mislabeled as \\"Versailles Oaks\\" or \\"Pakenham's Oaks\\" (the latter since General Edward Pakenham met his fatal end from battlefield injuries among Denis de La Ronde's oaks). On December 23, 1814, General Andrew Jackson learned of the advances and position of the British encampment from Colonel Pierre Denys de La Ronde and his son-in-law, Major Gabriel Viller√©.Creole families of New Orleans, by King, Grace Elizabeth; Macmillan; New York, USA; 1921; p. 315: \\"Colonel de la Ronde, who himself had just rushed in from his command at Chef Menteur on the lake with the news of the British landing. The two officials jumped in a skiff at the river bank, crossed the stream and, seizing horses on the other side, spurred to the city where, covered with mud and breathless from their ride, they made their report to General Jackson, surrounded by his aides, that 'the British were encamped on the soil of Louisiana'! To repeat the old, old anecdote which can never be too often repeated in the estimation of Louisianians ‚Äî At the close of Major Villere's narrative the General drew up his figure to its full height, and with an eye of fire and an emphatic blow with his clenched fist upon the table, swore his oath: 'By the Eternal, they shall not sleep on our soil!'...The Chalmette plantation has gained the honor of naming the great victory, but the attack and the retreat were made through the de la Ronde place; and many a gallant British officer and soldier breathed his last under the soft shade of the old oaks whose great trunks still carry the scars of cannon balls and even the balls themselves.\\"The Story of the Battle of New Orleans, by Arthur, Stanley Clisby; Louisiana Historical Society; New Orleans, USA; 1915; p.97: \\"Judge Walker's account continues. \\"The sounds ceased at the door of his headquarters and the sentinel on duty announced the arrival of three gentlemen who desired to see the General immediately, having important intelligence to communicate. 'Show them in,' ordered the General. The visitors proved to be Mr. Dussau de la Croix, Major Gabriel Villere and Colonel De la Ronde. They were stained with mud and nearly breathless with the rapidity of their ride. 'What news do you bring, gentlemen?' eagerly asked the General. 'Important, highly important!' responded Mr. de lu Croix. The British have arrived at Villere's plantation nine miles below the city and are there encamped. Here is Major Villere, who was captured by them, has escaped and will now relate his story.'\\" The Night Attack of the Battle of New Orleans was subsequentbvly fought on the La Ronde plantation.The Story of the Battle of New Orleans, by Arthur, Stanley Clisby; Louisiana Historical Society; New Orleans, USA' 1915; p.123. Major Viller√© was the son of Louisiana's future first Creole Governor, Jacques Viller√©. The La Ronde mansion was looted and heavily damaged by the British during the fateful Night Attack of December 23, 1814, which effectively launched the Battle of New Orleans, then further ruined when commandeered by the British as a field hospital. The house then burned about 70 years later, though most of the walls remained standing until the hurricane of 1915.Wilson, Samuel, Jr.: Plantation Houses on the Battlefield of New Orleans. New Orleans: Louisiana Landmarks Society, 1989.

Considered inferior to the competing Douglas XSB2D and requiring higher grade fuel than was provided on aircraft carriers, the project was cancelled before any aircraft were built. ==Design and development== In response to a Navy request for proposals issued on 3 February 1941 for a replacement for the SB2C,Norton 2008Lawson 2001 p.82 Curtiss designed an improved and enlarged version of the Helldiver, which was, at the time, still only in the process of flight testing. A larger tail, revised wing planform and tricycle landing gear distinguished the aircraft from its predecessor, in addition to the provision of heavier armament. An internal bomb bay in the midsection of the aircraft could carry up to of bombs, or alternatively, two torpedoes could be carried in semi- submerged mountings. In addition, hardpoints for two bombs were fitted under the wings. Forward-firing armament proposals were for the aircraft to be fitted with either six .50-calibre machine guns or four 20mm cannon in the wings, while defensive armament was planned to be fitted in a power-operated turret. Power was intended to be provided by a Wright R-3350 of , while the Pratt & Whitney R-4360, giving , was considered for future installation.Johnson 2008, pp. 425-426. Impressed with the inspection of the mockup of the massive aircraft in December 1941, the Navy ordered two prototypes, and parts of the design were tested by the XSB2C-6. As the project progressed during 1942, however, it was determined to be inferior to the competing Douglas aircraft. This, combined with the aircraft's requirement for 115/145 octane fuel, which was considered difficult to handle aboard ship, and the decision by the Bureau of Aeronautics that future attack aircraft would be single-seat aircraft, led to the Navy's decision to cancel the prototype contract, and no examples of the XSB3C were ever built. ==Specifications (XSB3C-1)== ==See also== ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * Johnson, E.R.

By the Tree got their start playing a series of small venues -- predominantly churches -- throughout the southern and southwestern United States. In 1999 they released two independent, self-produced CDs, which they sold at their concerts. By 2001, these two CDs had sold a combined 30,000 units, which more than recouped their production costs, and additionally brought them to the attention of the Christian music industry. The band eventually signed with Fervent Records, part of the BMG music publishing company. Their first national U.S. commercial recording was Invade My Soul. The album charted on the Billboard Christian Albums chart and Independent chart. The album eventually went on to win two Dove Awards: The album itself won Best Modern Rock/Alternative Album, and the album's title track won Best Recorded Song. By the Tree achieved a number-one hit single with a cover of Jeremy Camp's song \\"Beautiful One\\" in 2004. The song reached the number-one position on the Billboard Hot Christian Songs chart on October 30, 2004, and stayed in the top spot for four weeks. By the Tree released four albums under the Fervent label. == Members == Current * Chuck Dennie - vocals *Aaron Blanton - drums * Ben Davis - bass Former *K.S.

The LGBT market comprises a group of customers who buy goods and services from a broad range of companies across industry segments and in many countries. ==History== One of the first instances of the impact of the LGBT community in the marketing world was in 1973 when Coors Brewing Company was the subject of a boycott by the LGBT community. The LGBT community joined to protest Coors' hiring practices, since Coors used a polygraph test when going through the hiring process and specifically asked an employee about their sexual orientation. Coors ignored the boycott for several years, but made some concessions in 1978, and in 1995 began several countermeasures, including dropping the questions regarding homosexuality and extending domestic partnership benefits to its LGBT employees. The company also hired Mary Cheney as a marketing representative and began advertising in The Advocate and at events such as Denver's PrideFest. ==Statistics== Marketing to the gay and lesbian community faces statistical obstacles in that few credible peer-reviewed estimates of the gay and lesbian marketplace have been published. In particular, the use of non- random \\"convenience surveys\\" on attendees at gay resorts and subscribers to gay or lesbian newspapers has resulted in unreliable statistical estimates of LGBT buying power. The exact number of gays and lesbians in a given market is generally, if not always, unknown. However, some national governments have started to publish data that include demographics of sexual orientation from census results. In the 2000 United States Census, two questions were asked that allowed same-sex partnerships to be counted, and the Census Bureau reported that there were more than 658,000 same-sex couples heading households in the United States. In 2013, the American Marketing Association reported that 3.5% of adults in the United States identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual and .3% of adults as transgender. At that time, the LGBT consumer market was estimated to have an overall buying power of more than $835 billion. ==Advertising categories== Major ad categories include travel, financial services, alcoholic beverages, automotive, entertainment, hair and skincare, luxury goods, pharmaceuticals, and fashion. For example, American Airlines has launched a specific LGBT-targeted vacations website. While over fifteen years old in the United States, LGBT marketing is a relatively new marketing phenomenon elsewhere in Australia and Europe, including Belgium and the Netherlands. Many brands that have previously ignored the existence of this segment of society now increasingly target LGBT customers. In August 2006, Time magazine carried a Business article on growing interest amongst brand name advertisers in Europe to target LGBT customers. In 2013, the Human Rights Campaign issued the Corporate Equality Index 2013,\\"Corporate Equality Index 2013\\". which provides a national benchmarking tool on corporate policies and practices related to LGBT employees in the United States. This is also used to determine a company's level of gay-friendliness. ==Social media== Social media plays an incredibly important part in an LGBT youth's life, with Amy Adele Hassinoff stating that \\"a variety of studies of gay, lesbian, transsexual and queer youth indicate that the internet provides an important way to connect with communities and romantic partners, find information, and gain confidence\\" (Hasinoff, 2012). For marketers, this is important knowledge to possess as it suggests that LGBT marketing should place a heavy focus on the social media aspects of their campaigns. ==Social marketing== A large amount of the marketing that is aimed at the LGBT community has a heavy focus on social marketing. Social marketing is defined by Alan R. Andreasen as: \\"The adaption of commercial marketing technologies... to influence the voluntary behaviour of target audiences to improve their personal welfare and that of the society of which they are a part\\" (Andreasen, 1994). Put simply, social marketing's main aim is to raise awareness about a topic or issue within a community and work to change the overall opinion, attitude, or actions associated with that issue. Social marketing in a community that is as intimate and intertwined as the LGBT community is an extremely effective and important way to get messages across that really benefit the community as a whole. ==Social benefits of successful LGBT marketing campaigns== The effects of a successful LGBT marketing campaign can positively impact the LGBT community in ways that make the community safer and more welcoming, which is the overall goal of social marketing. Some examples of these effects include: === Love Your Condom ‚Äì New Zealand === The New Zealand Aids Foundation (NZAF) launched the Love Your Condom (LYC) campaign in 2014 to promote the concept of safer sex through the active use of condoms and lube every time gay/bisexual men have sex. The overall goal of the campaign was to reduce the transmission of HIV in New Zealand amongst gay and bisexual men, as these were the groups that were identified as the highest at risk (Clayton-Brown, 2015). The LYC campaign incorporates traditional media, such as billboards and print, (i.e. newspapers and magazines), along with an active social media presence and guerrilla marketing to engage with its target audience ‚Äì gay/bisexual men in New Zealand. The campaign was launched after the NZAF executive director Shaun Robinson noticed condom use amongst men who have sex with men, otherwise known as MSM, was on the decline, both in NZ and internationally (Saxton et al., 2015). The success of the campaign can be measured through the popularity of the LYC social media channels as a part of the NZ LGBT community, and in the statistic published on the NZAF webpage that states \\"new HIV infection rates among MSM in NZ have dropped 12%\\" since the launch of LYC. (NZAF, n.d.) === Know Your Status Stage ‚Äì New York === The not-for-profit organisation LifeBeat is a charity that works with the music industry to educate America's young LGBT and their allies about the realities and dangers of HIV/AIDS (LifeBeat, c2013). In 2014 LifeBeat launched the Know Your Status Stage (KYSS) campaign to try and raise awareness for the importance of getting tested for HIV on a larger scale than ever before. The idea behind it was to hold a large scale music event with artists that were very attractive to the target audience, (LGBT aged 13‚Äì25), where the only way to receive a ticket was to take a simple HIV test. The two objectives were to get at least 167 youth to visit the testing locations, and to attract NYC youth who had never been tested. (Effie Worldwide, 2015) Due to the mass followings of the artists on social media, as well as the incorporation of traditional advertising through the use of billboards in popular areas and ads in newspapers that were popular with their target audience, the campaign went viral. A large factor of this success is that today's youth experience a new phenomenon that has been labelled 'FOMO', or fear of missing out, as a result of social media which meant more and more of the target audience were getting tested just to attend this event (Przybylski et al., 2013). The success of this campaign was unprecedented due to the heavy online social media presence of the youth, spreading this event through word of mouth. The objective of 167 youth tested was almost tripled, and 60% of those youth tested said they had never been tested before, with 98% of those saying they would get tested again. (Effie Worldwide, 2015) As a direct result of this campaign, numbers of youth that were educated in terms of HIV and their own status in New York City grew considerably, and therefore the LGBT community could be perceived as a safer place, as these youth were now aware of the risks involved with sex, and the consequences of unsafe sex. LifeBeat stated that \\"due to the impressive performance of the KYSS idea in New York, the name was registered to spread the initiative to other cities in other states with high youth HIV indices, like Florida, California, Texas and Georgia\\" (Effie Worldwide, 2015). ==Controversies== LGBT marketing initiatives have not been without controversy both for and against them. Coors Brewing Company was the subject of a boycott by the LGBT community starting in 1973. The boycott was initiated by labor unions to protest the company's antagonistic practices, and was later joined by African Americans, Latinos, and the LGBT community. The LGBT community joined to protest Coors' hiring practices ‚Äì polygraph tests were often required, during which the prospective employee was asked about their sexual orientation. Coors ignored the boycott for several years, but made some concessions in 1978, and in 1995 began several countermeasures, including dropping the questions regarding homosexuality and extending domestic partnership benefits to its LGBT employees. The company also hired Mary Cheney as a marketing representative and began advertising in The Advocate and at events such as Denver's PrideFest. Specialist LGBT marketing agencies in various countries provide specialised LGBT market services to companies seeking to target LGBT customers. The tobacco and alcohol industries have marketed products directly to the LGBT+ community. In 1990, ACT-UP, an AIDS organization, boycotted Phillip Morris. Following this, other tobacco companies began funding AIDS organizations. In a 2013 study, LGBT+ participants reported statistically significant higher levels of exposure to tobacco-related content than non- LGBT+ participants. In 2010, of the sampled parades that listed sponsors, 61% of the prides were sponsored by the alcohol industry. In a study gauging LGBT+ response to targeted marketing, researchers noted that participants, particularly non-POC, interpreted it as valuable representation. The LGBT+ community has historically suffered from higher levels of substance abuse than non-LGBT+ individuals. As of 2013, LGBT+ youth struggle with higher levels of alcohol usage than their non-LGBT+ peers, a pattern previously seen in 1998, 2003, and 2008 data. In a 2016 study, 49.5% of LGBT+ respondents reported current cigarette smoking, while 70.2% recognized smoking endangered one's health. In 2009-2010 data from the National Adult Tobacco Survey, gay and bisexual smokers were less likely to be aware of cessation helplines than straight smokers. Marketing campaigns focusing on lowering levels of LGBT+ substance abuse have been attempted. Break Up, a LGBT+ focused anti-smoking campaign, was met with mixed results; while a study following its implementation indicated helpline usage had increased, cessation attempts had not. In 2016, the FDA funded the This Free Life campaign to help prevent and reduce smoking among LGBT+ young adults. ==Pinkwashing== Anarcho-queer collective Mashpritzot hold a \\"die-in\\" protest against Israeli pinkwashing and the perceived homonormative priorities of the LGBT support centre in the city. \\"Pinkwashing\\" is a portmanteau compound word of the words \\"pink\\" and \\"whitewashing\\" that is used to describe a variety of marketing and political strategies aimed at promoting a product or an entity through an appeal to queer-friendliness, primarily by political or social activists. The phrase was originally coined by Breast Cancer Action to identify companies that claimed to support women with breast cancer while actually profiting from their illness. == See also == * Commercial Closet Association * Gay-friendly * LGBT * LGBT culture * Out Now Consulting * Pink capitalism * Pink Dollar * Pinkwashing * Project SCUM * Queerbaiting == References == ==External links== *CommercialCloset.org ‚Äì Nonprofit with worldwide LGBT marketing information. *Gay Market News ‚Äì covers latest news on gay marketing *Survey Reveals Gay Spending Power *Corporate America Taking Notice of GLBT Market *Survey: Advertising Motivates Gay Consumers Category:LGBT and society Marketing Category:Marketing by target group ","title":"LGBT marketing"},{"id":"3255819","text":"Knights of the Cross is the eighth studio album by German heavy metal band Grave Digger, released in 1998.

The Order of The Poor Knights Of Christ and the Temple Of Solomon, originate from a group of nine Aristocrates, whose sole aim was the protection of the Holy Land. So let us undertake a journey into the past, back to the origin, rise and fall of the Order of the Templars. A journey, which will lead as to the legendary world of the Knights of the Cross.\\" The album tells the story of the Knights Templar from the times of the Order's birth in 1119, through the years of its glory, and finally to its fall in 1312. The first song describes the First Crusade organised in the West after Muslim victories in Asia Minor over the weakening forces of Byzantine Empire (\\"Deus Lo Vult\\", \\"Knights of the Cross\\"). Subsequent songs mention the foundation of the Knights Templar by French knight Hugues de Payens in 1119 after the establishing of the Kingdom of Jerusalem (\\"Monks of War\\"), and the new danger to the Franks brought some time later by Saladin's Egyptian armies and Nizari sect of Hashashim (\\"Heroes Of This Time\\", \\"Fanatic Assassins\\"). Then the album deals with cruelties of the Third Crusade led by Richard I of England and Philip Augustus of France (\\"Lionheart\\"), and with the myth of Templars holding the Holy Grail (\\"Keeper Of The Holy Grail\\"). The next four songs deals with the tragic end of the Order: putting hundreds of Knights Templar under arrest in 1307 to face the Inquisition on false accusations by French king Philip the Fair of heresy and homosexual practicies within the Order (\\"Inquisition\\"), prisoners' statements - forced under torture - about worshipping the demon Baphomet which led to Order's cancellation by Pope Clement V in 1312 (\\"Baphomet\\"), the escape of some former Templar Knights into Scotland (\\"Over the Sea\\"), and the execution of Order's last Grand Master Jacques de Molay in 1314, who was believed to curse the King and the Pope from his stake while being burned alive, so both of them would die the same year he did (\\"The Curse of Jacques\\"). The last song deals with the alleged help of former Templar Knights to the Scots during the Battle of Bannockburn, which allowed them to acquire independence from the English rule (\\"Battle of Bannockburn\\"). ==Historical accuracy== The story incorporates many myths and legends (i.e. the Holy Grail, the curse of Jacques de Molay, the cult of Baphomet), but its historical content is mostly close to the truth (at least on the level of names, dates and places). Many scholars believe that the end of the Order was truly orchestrated by Philip the Fair due to his debts and deep hatred toward the Templar Knights, who in fact were most likely innocent of any heresy. They also became virtually obsolete after Acre was lost to the Saracens, marking the fall of Kingdom of Jerusalem, for now there was nowhere to fight Pagans, except for the Eastern Europe where Teutonic Knights have a de facto monopoly due to the major political role of Holy Roman Empire supporting them.

Trained as an historian, and the author of many works of European history, she also wrote novels, poems, and a play. Asteroid 879 Ricarda is named in her honour. She was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature seven times. == Early life and education== Huch was born in Braunschweig to Marie Louise and Georg Heinrich Huch in 1864. The Huchs were a well off merchant family. Her brother Rudolf and cousins Friedrich and Felix were writers. While living with her family in Braunschweig she corresponded with Ferdinand T√∂nnies. Because German universities did not allow women to graduate, Huch left Braunschweig in 1887 and moved to Zurich to take the entrance examinations for the University of Zurich. She matriculated into a PhD program in history and received her doctorate in 1892 for a dissertation on \\"The neutrality of the Confederation during the Spanish War of Succession\\" (Die Neutralit√§t der Eidgenossenschaft w√§hrend des spanischen Erbfolgekrieges). While at the University of Zurich she established lasting friendships with Marie Baum, Hedwig Bleuler-Waser and Marianne Plehn, who like her had come to Zurich to study. After receiving her doctorate she found employment at the Zurich public library. In 1896 she taught at a girl's school in Bremen. == Early publications and historic studies== In the 1890s Huch published her first poems and stories. In 1892 her first novel was published Erinnerungen von Ludolf Ursleu dem J√ºngeren. In 1897 Huch moved to Vienna to research Romanticism. In Vienna she met the Italian dentist Ermanno Ceconi, whom she married in 1898. In 1899 she gave birth to their daughter Marietta. In 1899 the first volume of her two volume study on German Romanticism was published, Bl√ºtezeit der Romantik. The book launched Huch as contributor to the contemporary cultural discourse in Germany and established her reputation as a historian. Ausbreitung und Verfall der Romantik was published in 1902. Huch argued that German Romanticism went through a period of blossoming and a later period of decay. She argued that August Wilhelm Schlegel, Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel, Friedrich von Hardenberg, Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder and Ludwig Tieck were exponents of early German Romanticism. In this blossoming period utopian thinking and a striving for balance between reason and fantasy, mind and body, culminated in the idea that human perfectibility was a task for everyone. Huch identifies late German Romanticism with a leaning towards simplistic folklore, myth and self-destructive tendencies. She counts Zacharias Werner, Clemens Brentano, Achim von Arnim, Bettine von Arnim and Justinus Kerner among the late and decadent Romantics. Huch lamented the aspirituality and technocentrism of her own day and expressed the hope that after the rejection of Romanticism in the first half of the 19th century the intellectual achievements of Romanticism would be regenerated. Huch emphasised the role of women in early German Romanticism, pointing to the writings of Caroline Schelling, Dorothea von Schlegel, Karoline von G√ºnderrode, Rahel Levin, Bettina von Arnim and Dorothea von Rodde-Schl√∂zer. Huch's historical research was challenged by her contemporaries. While her meticulous research was admired and her breath of vision was honoured, she was criticised for poetic imagination. In her days historians would interpret the meaning of historic documents. While Huch focused on conjuring up images by describing contents, symbolism, colour and moods to invoke the world view of a historic period. Her contemporary Toni Wolff identified Huch as medial historian who had the ability to ‚Äúevoke historical situations and persons‚Äù. This caused bewilderment among her contemporaries, who were used to thinking of history as big events, military campaigns and great men. Instead Huch presented the historic facts and drew character studies of the individuals, with their failures and triumphs. In her historic studies she also charted the lives of ordinary people, such as monks, society ladies and children. Huch and her husband moved to Trieste and then to Munich. In the early 1900 the couple divorced, though Huch remained close to Ceconi. In 1903 Huch's novel Vita somnium breve was published, which was retitled and republished in 1913 as Michael Unger. In 1906 her treatise on Gottfried Keller Die Geschichte von Garibaldi was published. A volume with poetry followed in 1907. In the same year Huch married her cousin Richard Huch, who had divorced from her sister in 1907. In 1908 she published a treatise on the Italian unification Aus dem Zeitalter des Risorgimento. == Publications during World War I == Wallenstein depicted as Mars, the God of war, riding the sky in a chariot pulled by four horses. Ceiling decoration in the main hall of the Wallenstein Palace Ricarda Huch; 1916, by Paul Peterich, sculptor, 1864‚Äì1937 In 1914 Huch celebrated her fiftieth birthday, three weeks after the assassination of Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, her final volume of her trilogy on the Thirty Years' War had just been completed. This trilogy solidified her reputation as one of Germany's foremost historians. During the first years of the World War I Huch lived in Munich. 1915 Huch's character study of Albrecht von Wallenstein was published, Wallenstein - Eine Charakterstudie. In it she chronicled Wallenstein's attempt to renew and unify Germany out of the Holy Roman Empire, which she termed a ‚Äúdegenerate and decadent‚Äù Reich. After World War I Huch's interpretation of regenerating Germany through war and violent revolution resonated among nationalists in the defeated Germany. In 1916 she moved to Switzerland, but returned to Munich in 1918 just before the German Empire collapsed. During the war she had also published Natur und Geist in 1914 and Luthers Glaube in 1916. Just after the war she published Der Sinn der heiligen Schrift in 1919. In her early autobiographical writings Huch had expressed a Lutheran faith combined with a Goethean view of history and the community. In Luthers Glaube she established counter arguments to modern scepticism, emphasising that Martin Luther was a great man of faith rather than the founder of a new church. While Huch emphasised the importance of the home country, and family values, she regarded change as inevitable and valued individuality above all else. Her books on religious and philosophical history conveyed a joined-up view of human beings, human life and history. == Publications during the Weimar Republic== In the early years of the Weimarer Republik Huch published Entpers√∂nlichung in 1921. In 1924 she published a study on the anarchist Michael Bakunin entitled Michael Bakunin und die Anarchie. Her study of the Prussian reformer Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein entitled Stein was published 1925. In 1927 she published in three volumes geographical essays of German cities Im alten Reich. Lebensbilder deutscher St√§dte. In these essays she describes the structure of old cities, their buildings and important historic events. Huch stressed the particularity of urban organisms and the communal spirit cities generated. Huch also examined the Medieval commune and charted the development of self-governing communities based on personal involvement and solidarity. Huch had first examined the idea of self-reliant communities, which she contrasted to what she perceived as artificial modern societies, in her biography of Bakunin. In 1927 Huch, her daughter and her son-in-law Franz B√∂hm moved to Berlin. In 1931 Huch was awarded the Goethe Prize. She was the first woman that was invited to join the Preu√üische Akademie der K√ºnste (Prussian Academy of Arts). In 1930 her treatise on the German revolutions of 1848‚Äì49 was published under the title Alte und neue G√∂tter (1848). Die Revolution des 19. Jahrhunderts in Deutschland. == Publications during the Third Reich == When the Nazis seized power in 1933 and proclaimed the German Dritte Reich she resigned in protest from the Prussian Academy of Arts. Huch and other members of the academy had in March 1933 received a letter from the president of the Prussian Academy of Arts, Max von Schillings, asking them to sign a declaration drafted by Gottfried Benn, declaring their loyalty to the new government. A public and infamous exchange of letters between Huch and Schillings followed. Huch refused to sign. Schillings responded, expressing the hope that the academy could count on her support and her continuous membership. Huch responded, saying that she will not forego her right to freedom of expression and asked Schillings whether her refusal to sign the declaration will inevitably lead to her exclusion from the academy. Schillings replied that the academy is merely asking its members to not publicly oppose the new government. Schillings also pointed out that if she resigned, she would be in the company of Heinrich Mann who had resigned from the academy to mount an unsuccessful attempt of mobilising a social democratic alliance against the NSDAP during the March 1933 elections. Schillings argued that this could not be her wish, since she had in her writings clearly expressed nationalist and conservative views. Huch responded, saying that it is natural for a German to feel German, but that she condemned the Nazis' strong-arm tactics, brutal centralization and intimidation of those with other opinions. Huch called the Nazis' tactics un-German, defended her right to freedom of expression and noted that she was not in agreement with the Nazi doctrine. Huch remained in Berlin and researched early German history, starting with Charles the Great. In 1934 she published the first volume of her trilogy on medieval Germany social history, focusing on various medieval political, social and religious institutions. R√∂misches Reich Deutscher Nation was followed by Das Zeitalter der Glaubensspaltung in 1937. Huch idealized medieval German culture, and passed comment on leadership, justice and Jews in Germany. Her views were an open challenge to the Nazi doctrine on Germanic culture and its roots. Her son-in-law B√∂hm was forced out of the public service by the Nazis. In 1936 Huch together with her daughter, B√∂hm and their son, moved to Jena. B√∂hm was able to secure a teaching contract with Jena University, but in 1937 he and Huch were accused of sedition because the two had defended the intellectual capacities of Jews at a dinner party. While neither of the two were convicted, B√∂hm could not maintain his teaching position. During World War II B√∂hm moved to Freiburg and later to Frankfurt, while Huch and her daughter remained in Jena. == Publications and work in the post-war period== When Jena was to become part of the Soviet zone of occupation Huch fled to West Germany and settled in Frankfurt. She began work on a book celebrating members of the German resistance to Nazism. In March 1946, 13 years after her resignation from the Prussian Academy of Arts she published a public appeal in Germany's daily newspapers asking for help in compiling biographical information on those who had sacrificed their lives to resist the Nazi terror. She reasoned that this ultimate sacrifice had helped all Germans to retain a grain of human dignity during a period of near boundless brutality. Huch argued that those who had resisted allowed all humans to rise from the swamp of everyday routine, light the spark for the fight against the bad and maintain the belief in the noble godliness of humanity. Huch was the honorary president of the 1947 German Writers' Congress in Frankfurt. She died at the age of 83 in November 1947, her book on the German resistance remained unfinished. ==Legacy== Professor Frank Trommler, University of Pennsylvania, in his study of the German literature elite during the Third Reich argues that Huch, along with Ernst Wiechert, Werner Bergengruen, Reinhold Schneider, Albrecht Haushofer and Friedrich Reck- Malleczewen, took a courageous stand on issues such as the suppression of freedom, the fight against tyranny, the longing for privacy and the simple life. Their reputation was grounded in their ability to articulate their opinions and in doing so authors like Huch shaped the political and cultural transformation in Germany after the demise of the Third Reich. These authors were closely observed by Nazi authorities because they were widely read by the German middle-class. Huch was in her 70s when the Nazi seized power, and unlike authors such as Thomas Mann who first fled into ‚Äò‚Äòinner emigration‚Äò‚Äò and then went into exile, she took a stand against the Nazi doctrine from the outset. Huch continued to live in Germany, made no attempt to conceal her convictions and published in Germany through Swiss publishers. In 1934 Mann wrote of his intellectual struggle against the powers that be \\"Getting through it and maintaining one‚Äôs own personal dignity and liberty is everything.\\" When Alfred Andersch assessed German literary output during the Nazi reign in 1947 he categorised Huch alongside Gerhart Hauptmann, Rudolf Alexander Schr√∂der, Hans Carossa and Gertrud von Le Fort as older and established poets who had stayed in Germany and upheld a tradition of \\"bourgeois classicism\\". Andersch counted the poets Stefan Andres, Horst Lange, Hans Leip, Martin Raschke and Eugen Gottlob Winkler among the younger generation who stayed in Germany and contributed to the resistance against Nazi authorities with their literary work. After the second world war Thomas Mann honoured Huch as \\"the first lady of German letters\\". == Publications by Huch == * Gedichte Dresden 1891 * Evoe Berlin 1892 * Erinnerungen von Ludolf Ursleu dem J√ºngeren Berlin 1893 * Gedichte Leipzig 1894 * Der Mondreigen von Schlaraffis Leipzig 1896 * Teufeleien, L√ºgenm√§rchen Leipzig 1897 * Haduvig im Kreuzgang Leipzig 1897 * Fra Celeste und andere Erz√§hlungen Hermann Haessel Verlag, Leipzig 1899 * Bl√ºtezeit der Romantik Leipzig 1899 * Ausbreitung und Verfall der Romantik Leipzig 1902 * Dornr√∂schen.

He was nicknamed Keravnos, Greek for \\"Thunder\\" or \\"Thunderbolt\\". ==Military career== Kondylis was born in Prouss√≥s. He enlisted in the army as a volunteer in 1896, and fought with the Greek expeditionary corps in Crete. He was later commissioned and participated in the Macedonian Struggle (1904-1908) leading his own guerrilla band, and was promoted to captain during the Balkan Wars (1912-1913). He supported the Movement of National Defence of Eleftherios Venizelos during the First World War, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel. A firm Venizelist, he opposed the restoration of King Constantine I in 1920, fleeing to Constantinople together with other Venizelist officers and organizing there the \\"Democratic Defence\\" (ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒÜŒºœÖŒΩŒ±). He returned after the 1922 Revolution as a major general, suppressed the royalist revolt of 1923, retired from the army, and became involved in politics. ==Political career== He was elected to Parliament at the 1923 elections for the constituency of Rodope, initially for the Democratic Union, and later founded the National Republican Party (ŒïŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫œå ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫œå ŒöœåŒºŒºŒ±), renamed in 1928 National Radical Party (ŒïŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫œå Œ°ŒπŒ∂ŒøœÉœÄŒ±œÉœÑŒπŒ∫œå ŒöœåŒºŒºŒ±). He was war minister from March to June 1924. On August 24, 1926, he overthrew the dictatorship of Theodoros Pangalos in a bloodless coup and formed a government, proclaiming elections for November. Notably, his party did not participate in these. In the elections of August 1928, voters elected nine of his party's candidates as MPs, and he was elected in Kavala. Kondylis in 1932 During this time, Kondylis began moving rightward. In 1932 he became war minister again in return for his support of the Populist government, a post he retained after the Populists were reelected in 1933. From this post he was instrumental in crushing the March 1935 Venizelist revolt. In the period immediately following the revolt, Kondylis became the real power in the country. He sacked numerous pro-republican soldiers and civil servants, and condemned Venizelos to death in absentia. By now, Kondylis was one of the strongest proponents of restoring the monarchy. However, he opposed Prime Minister Panagis Tsaldaris' call for a referendum. On October 10, 1935, Kondylis and several other officers called on Tsaldaris and forced him to resign. Kondylis forced President Alexandros Zaimis to name him the new premier. Later that day, Kondylis forced Zaimis to resign, declared himself Regent, abolished the Republic and staged a plebiscite on November 3 for the return of the monarchy. The official tally showed that 98 percent of the voters supported the return of George II‚Äîan implausibly high total that could have only been obtained through massive fraud. Indeed, the vote took place under less-than-secret conditions. Voters were given the choice of dropping a blue piece of paper in the ballot box if they supported the monarchy, and a red one if they supported the republic. Those who supported the republic risked being beaten up. Under those circumstances, it took a brave Greek to vote \\"no.\\" By this time, Kondylis had turned so far to the right that he now openly sympathized with fascism. He hoped to echo Benito Mussolini's example in Italy, in which Victor Emmanuel III had been reduced to a puppet.By the Grace of God, TIME Magazine, November 18, 1935 George returned to Greece on 25 November, and retained Kondylis as prime minister. Kondylis soon quarreled with the king, who was not content to be a mere puppet, and resigned five days later. In the January 1936 elections, he cooperated with Ioannis Rallis and managed to have fifteen MPs elected. Soon after, however, he died of a heart attack on February 1, 1936, in Athens. His nephew, George Kondylis Jr., became a general in the Greek army and later fought against the Axis during the German invasion of Greece. He was awarded Serbian Order of the White Eagle. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1878 births Category:1936 deaths Category:People from Prousos Category:Regents of Greece Category:Prime Ministers of Greece Category:Deputy Prime Ministers of Greece Category:Ministers of Military Affairs of Greece Category:Hellenic Army generals Category:Greek military personnel of World War I Category:Greek military personnel of the Balkan Wars Category:Greek military personnel of the Greco-Turkish War (1919‚Äì1922) Category:Greek military personnel of the Macedonian Struggle Category:Leaders who took power by coup Category:19th-century Greek people Category:Recipients of the Order of the White Eagle (Serbia) Category:Ministers of Naval Affairs of Greece ","title":"Georgios Kondylis"},{"id":"3255876","text":"James Jacob Lomas (born 1 March 1990) is a British Olivier Award-winning actor best known for his role as Billy Elliot in Billy Elliot the Musical.

As nitric acid was added to a column containing an ion-exchange resin and americium, the chemicals exploded, blowing out the leaded glass of the glove box. Harold was exposed to at least 37 MBq of americium-241 and nitric acid. He was hit on the right side by a mixture of nitric acid, broken glass, americium and ion exchange resin. Harold was helped from the room, had his clothing removed and was washed with water at the scene. He was transferred to a decontamination facility where he was washed again and given a dose of one gram of Ca-DTPA on arrival. For the first week he had two baths per day, then he had one bath per day for two months. For the first five days he was treated with the calcium complex of DTPA and then after that for four years he was treated with a total of 583 grams of the zinc complex of DTPA. The treatment reduced the systemic deposition to 500 kBq instead of the 19 MBq which he would otherwise have retained inside his body. Because of risk of exposure to other individuals, he was placed in isolation in the Hanford Emergency Decontamination Facility for five months and underwent chelation therapy using DTPA by Dr. Bryce Breitenstein. By 1977, his body's radiation count had fallen by about 80 percent. When McCluskey returned home, friends and church members avoided him. His minister finally had to tell people it was safe to be around him. Although McCluskey largely avoided the media, Breitenstein said McCluskey sometimes accompanied him when he gave lectures on the case. \\"He really wanted people to know what happened as long as it is rationally presented,\\" Breitenstein said. Several times after the explosion, McCluskey spoke in favor of developing nuclear power, saying he saw his injuries as the result of \\"purely an industrial accident.\\" He died on August 17, 1987, of coronary artery disease. He had this disease before the accident, and a post mortem examination found no signs of cancer. At the time of his death he had 55 kBq of americium in his soft tissues (27.9 kBq in the liver), 470 kBq in the mineral surfaces of the bones and bone marrow contained 20 kBq of americium. == References == ==Further reading== * Health Physics, October 1983 - Volume 45 - Issue 4 - dedicated to the accident in 1983 (Health Physics Society) * Workers Demolish McCluskey Room at Hanford (KGMI) Category:1912 births Category:1987 deaths Category:Victims of radiological poisoning Category:People from Prosser, Washington Category:Hanford Site people ","title":"Harold McCluskey"},{"id":"3255915","text":"right Hillsboro Parish was created as a civil parish in Queens County, Prince Edward Island, Canada, during the 1764-1766 survey of Samuel Holland.

Retrieved: 2 October 2010. or electrical power on a national or regional level, using fixed infrastructure. The term is defined by the European Commission. The certification procedure for Transmission System Operators is listed in Article 10 of the Electricity and Gas Directives of 2009. Due to the cost of establishing a transmission infrastructure, such as main power lines or gas main lines and associated connection points, a TSO is usually a natural monopoly, and as such is often subjected to regulations. In electrical power business, a TSO is an operator that transmits electrical power from generation plants over the electrical grid to regional or local electricity distribution operators. In natural gas business, a TSO receives gas from producers, transports it via pipeline through an area and delivers to gas distribution companies. The United States has similar organizational categories: independent system operator (ISO) and regional transmission organization (RTO). ==Role in electrical power transmission== Safety and reliability are a critical issue for transmission system operators, since any failure on their grid or their electrical generation sources might propagate to a very large number of customers, causing personal and property damages. Natural hazards and generation/consumption imbalances are a major cause of concern. To minimize the probability of grid instability and failure, regional or national transmission system operators are interconnected to each other. ===Electricity market operations=== The role of the System Operator in a wholesale electricity market is to manage the security of the power system in real time and co-ordinate the supply of and demand for electricity, in a manner that avoids fluctuations in frequency or interruptions of supply. The System Operator service is normally specified in rules or codes established as part of the electricity market. The System Operator function may be owned by the transmission grid company, or may be fully independent.irene-40-Road map towards a future electricity network They are often wholly or partly owned by state or national governments. In many cases they are independent of electricity generation companies (upstream) and electricity distribution companies (downstream). They are financed either by the states or countries or by charging a toll proportional to the energy they carry. The System Operator is required to maintain a continuous (second-by-second) balance between electricity supply from power stations and demand from consumers, and also ensure the provision of reserves that will allow for sudden contingencies. The System Operator achieves this by determining the optimal combination of generating stations and reserve providers for each market trading period, instructing generators when and how much electricity to generate, and managing any contingent events that cause the balance between supply and demand to be disrupted. System Operations staff undertake this work using sophisticated energy modelling and communications systems. In addition to its roles of real- time dispatch of generation and managing security, the System Operator also carries out investigations and planning to ensure that supply can meet demand and system security can be maintained during future trading periods. Examples of planning work may include coordinating generator and transmission outages, facilitating commissioning of new generating plant and procuring ancillary services to support power system operation. ==Role in gas transmission== A gas TSO works for the functioning of the internal market and cross-border trade for gas and to ensure the optimal management, coordinated operation and sound technical evolution of the natural gas transmission network. Some gas TSOs also provide the marketplace for gas trading. ==See also== *Electric power distribution *European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSO-G) *Independent system operator (ISO) and regional transmission organization (RTO, US) *Mains electricity and mains electricity by country *High-voltage direct current (HVDC), Electric power transmission, Electrical grid *Smart grid, Super grid *Regional transmission organization (North America) ==References== Category:Natural gas pipeline companies ","title":"Transmission system operator"},{"id":"3255925","text":"Sturminster Newton is a town in Dorset, England.

Warrick appeared in all but five episodes until his death in the first episode of season nine, with the exceptions of \\"Caged\\" from season two, \\"After the Show\\" from season four, \\"Crow's Feet\\" and \\"Committed\\" from season five, and \\"The Chick Chop Flick Shop\\" from season eight. == Early life and childhood == Brown was a Las Vegas native, whose father abandoned him soon after his birth, and whose mother died when he was seven years old. Raised by his grandmother and Aunt Bertha, Warrick found it very difficult to socialize, and could often be found with his head in a book. His love of mathematics and science took him to Western Las Vegas University, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry. == Background and personality == Warrick grew up in a strict household, and kept his position as a casino runner a secret from his grandmother. He once told Catherine that while he was unpopular in high school he had \\"got a little action\\". He was strongly influenced by a community organizer who ran a center where he spent time after school. Early in the series it was discovered that Warrick had a gambling addiction. He even admitted to Sara Sidle that he counted cards. After an incident in the pilot episode that resulted in a rookie's death, Warrick's gambling addiction caused friction with a number of other team members. Sara did not get along with Warrick early in the series because she knew of his addiction; however, they ended up becoming good friends and colleagues. Warrick was also something of a mentor and older brother to Greg Sanders. He did chastise Sanders when the latter, still a very green trainee at the time, showed up late to a crime scene, dressed as if he just woken up, and not having restocked or sterilized his kit, prior to showing the young Sanders how Brown's own vehicle was properly stocked and well-organized. Warrick was also sensitive to the difficulties of minorities. When Jason, an African-American teenager he was mentoring, was arrested, Warrick paid his bail. Also, Warrick showed understanding and sympathy for the young African American James Moore, who committed a hit and run that resulted in the death of a young girl. He offered advice before James was taken into custody and gave him his cell phone number. He told James to contact him just in case trouble arises in prison. === Family === After dating a woman named Tina for a short time, Warrick proposed and married her in Season 6. Nearing the Season 6 finale, Warrick's marriage seemed to have become rocky, especially when he discovered that she was cheating on him. Through the midpoint of Season 7, Warrick still wore his wedding band, which could suggest that he and Tina had worked through their differences. In season 8, however, Warrick told Catherine that he was getting divorced. Later on in the season, Warrick found out that Tina was pregnant with his child. He asked her to let him raise the child with her, only to be met by resistance from Tina. At Warrick's funeral, Sara and Greg discovered that Warrick had a son named Eli with Tina, and had been fighting for custody over him. Tina also brought their son to the funeral. == Relationships == === Catherine Willows === Warrick appeared to have a close working and personal relationship with Catherine Willows, although it became clear throughout the show that their relationship did not develop into a romantic one. In the season 5 episode \\"Down the Drain\\", he and Catherine shared a \\"romantic\\" moment which was interrupted. Catherine and Warrick continued to flirt with each other until Season 6, when Warrick proposed to his girlfriend, Tina. Catherine told Warrick that she was disappointed that he hadn't told her, and was visibly upset and jealous of his new relationship. === Nick Stokes === Warrick and co-worker Nick Stokes were close friends and surrogate brothers. Warrick was frightened when Nick was kidnapped and buried alive, and led the team in rescuing him. Nick was very upset when Warrick was murdered, and was tempted to kill his murderer in cold blood; he relented and let the killer live, however, reasoning that Warrick would not have wanted him to throw his life away. === Gil Grissom === Warrick had a deep, abiding respect for Gil Grissom. Grissom genuinely cared for Warrick as well; he regarded Warrick as like a son, often trying to help the younger man when he struggled with his gambling addiction. He later said that he thought Warrick could potentially have been his successor as lab supervisor. Grissom was the first person to find Warrick after he was shot, and held him in his arms as he died. Later in the episode, \\"For Warrick\\", the team found a video in Warrick's home in which he stated that he never knew his biological father, but if he had to choose someone to be his father, it would have been Grissom. === Greg Sanders === Warrick was something of an older brother to Greg Sanders. When Sanders expressed an interest in transitioning out into the field, Warrick took him under his wing. In the episode \\"Early Rollout\\", when Sanders came to the scene clearly unprepared, arriving in desheveled street clothes and a trunk in almost complete disarray, Warrick chastised him for that, noting that he would've gotten much worse had it been from Grissom. Warrick then proceeded to show Greg how a properly stocked trunk should look, complete with a properly stocked & sterilised kit, a backup kit, divider full of forms, and everything else he could possibly need to process a scene, right down to what he wanted to eat & how he wanted his food prepared. ==Death== In the Season 8 finale, \\"For Gedda\\", Warrick was held for questioning after the murder of mafia boss Lou Gedda. Earlier in the season, Warrick had become involved with a woman connected with Gedda. After she was killed, Warrick became a prime suspect in her murder. During the investigation, rumors spread that Gedda had a mole in the LVPD. Gedda called Warrick to inform him that he was \\"ready to talk\\". When Gedda was murdered, Warrick was framed for his death. Grissom's team discovered that another LVPD officer was involved in Gedda's murder and the LVPD did not press charges against Warrick. After Warrick's release, he and the rest of Grissom's team ate at a local diner to celebrate his acquittal. As Warrick left the restaurant and headed to his car, Undersheriff Jeffrey McKeen - the mole in the LVPD - shot him twice, mortally wounding him. In the Season 9 premiere, \\"For Warrick\\", Grissom found Warrick bleeding to death in his car; Warrick tried to tell Grissom that McKeen shot him, but was deterred by McKeen's brandishing of his sidearm, and died in Grissom's arms. McKeen was eventually found out and arrested for his murder. Warrick's funeral was held a few days later and Grissom delivered an emotional eulogy, saying that he would miss him \\"so much\\". To honor Warrick's memory, the CSI team started a college fund for his son Eli. In the CSI: Miami season eight episode \\"Bone Voyage\\", when Lt. Horatio Caine meets Raymond Langston for the first time, he asked Langston if he could tell Catherine that, \\"I'm very sorry about Warrick Brown\\". == References == Category:2008 deaths Category:CSI: Crime Scene Investigation characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2000 Category:Fictional African-American people Category:Fictional gamblers Category:Fictional musicians Category:Fictional scientists Category:Fictional orphans ","title":"Warrick Brown"},{"id":"3255954","text":"The Coalition for the Future American Worker is an umbrella coalition of organizations in America that claim that current immigration policies are harming American workers.

He was the joint International Coordinator for the Green Party and stood against Prime Minister Theresa May as the Maidenhead Green candidate in the 2017 general election. Formerly the party's Principal Speaker, he is known as a prominent eco-socialist, campaigning both for environmentalism and socialism. Alongside his political role, Wall is an academic and a writer, having published on the subject of ecosocialism and the wider Green politics movement. He is a contributor to the Morning Star newspaper and a blogger. ==Biography== ===Early political activism=== Wall first became involved in the Green movement in 1979. He joined the Ecology Party (later the Green Party of England and Wales) in 1980. By 1987, Wall was standing for the Ecology Party against Chris Patten in Bath. At the time of the European Parliament election in 1989, Wall was one of three National Speakers in the Green Party. In the elections themselves, which saw the Green Party gain over 2 million votes (14.5% of the national poll), Wall received 15% of the vote in the Bristol constituency. During his time in the Green Party, Wall has been a Parish Councillor. Wall rose to national prominence in the wake of the 1989 result, when he presented himself to the national press as a 'left wing' candidate for the ruling Green Party Council in opposition to the leadership. He styled himself a 'maverick''Triumph for 'Fundies' hits Green Party, Daily Mail, 21 September 1989 and a Green 'fundamentalist'.'Greens face wrangles over party leadership, Guardian, 21 September 1989 He was then in turn attacked as a 'parasite' by pragmatists such as Sara Parkin and Jonathon Porritt.'Greens Warned of extremist 'parasites, Independent, 22 September 1989 These divisions contributed to highly negative press coverage at the time. ===Academic career=== Wall is a visiting tutor at the Department of Politics at Goldsmiths College, University of London, where he teaches a course on the new radical political economy. His PhD thesis was titled The Politics of Earth First! UK. He has written a series of books on eco-socialism and green politics. Getting There: Steps Towards a Green Society was published in 1990, and looked at the strategies of green politics. A Green Manifesto for the 1990s, also written in 1990, outlined the Green vision. In 1994, a book examining the roots of ecological politics, Green History: A Reader in Environmental Literature, Philosophy, and Politics and Weaving a Bower Against Endless Night: An Illustrated History of the Green Party as a Green Party publication appeared.Wall, Derek, Weaving a Bower Against Endless Night: An Illustrated History of the Green Party, 1994 Having taken a BSc in Archaeology at the University of London, he subsequently completed a PhD at the University of the West of England, later published in a revised form in 1999 as a book entitled Earth First! and the Anti-Roads Movement: Radical Environmentalism and Comparative Social Movements. Academic reviews for the book were mixed. One academic reviewer commented that the book offered \\"valuable and often original information about the radical environmentalist movement\\" but \\"fails to provide a systematic analysis of the topic\\" and uncritically paid little attention to possible personal agendas of the activists interviewed.http://www.webhost.ua.ac.be/extremismanddemocracy/newsletter/Newsletter3.htm#gallagher Babylon and Beyond: The Economics of Anti-Capitalist, Anti-Globalist and Radical Green Movements (2005), looks at the history of anti-capitalism, including reformist capitalists (such as Joseph Stiglitz), anti-corporate critics (namely Naomi Klein and David Korten), monetary reformers, eco- socialists (especially Joel Kovel), Marxists, green localists (including Caroline Lucas, Mike Woodin and Vandana Shiva) and anarchists (particularly Michael Hardt and Toni Negri). It includes a foreword by N√°ndor T√°nczos, the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand MP.Wall, Derek, Babylon and Beyond: The Economics of Anti-Capitalist, Anti-Globalist and Radical Green Movements, 2005 Wall has written for the left-wing magazine Red Pepper and is an advisory editor of Socialist Resistance. He has also published articles in academic journals such as Environmental Politics, Social Movement Studies and Capitalism Nature Socialism. ===Later political activism=== Wall was also a prominent figure opposing the organisational changes by the group known as Green 2000 along with Penny Kemp and John Norris. Organising a faction within the Green Party known as the Association of Socialist Greens, this left grouping was accused by pragmatists such as Mallen Baker as being responsible for ensuring the party was \\"going knowhere fast\\".Challenge Magazine, Winter 1995 Wall is an eco-socialist and anti-capitalist who believes that \\"an infinitely growing capitalist economy destroys nature, fuels injustice and leads to an alienated way of life\\". He describes Green politics as \\"the politics of survival\\", stressing that \\"unless we build a green economy based on meeting need rather than greed our children face a bleak future\\". Distinguishing between socially-oriented development and capitalist growth, Wall asserts that there is \\"no contradiction between development and ecology,\\" while, on the other hand, there is \\"a contradiction between capitalist economic growth and human lifeand the life of all other species.\\"Wall, Derek. Address to Global Future of Globalised Disaster? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD4r6Q3KL3Y He adds that \\"a world dominated by the need for constant growth puts people and the rest nature behind a blind economic system of accumulation.\\" He is a founder member of the Green Left, an anti-capitalist and eco-socialist faction within the Green Party, which held its first meeting in June 2006.(Green Party of England and Wales) Website His critique of Green Party politics is that ambition tends to dilute policy, reduce democracy and lead to failure. He says of the Green 2000 project to modernise the executive structures and reduce the number of Principal Speakers to two: > \\"The right around the Green 2000 faction wanted to make us into a mainstream > party with mass appeal, ditch the radicalism, re-engineer the Party > constitution and centralise power. We fought them. I remember Sara Parkin > talking to the Independent about 'socialist parasites' i.e. myself and Penny > Kemp who had been members nearly as long as her. They won and then imploded, > when the Party received just a couple of percentage at the 1992 General > Election. When the 'realists' believe in achieving a Westminster > Parliamentary government by 2000 (thus Green 2000), give me fundamentalism.\\" Wall has continued to be an out-spoken member of the Green Party, particularly on the issue of entering into alliances with other parties. He was given a vote of censure by the Green Party Association of Green Councillors (AGC) when he made comments concerning the alliance between Green Party, Conservative and Liberal Democrat councillors on the Leeds City Council; he stated in Red Pepper magazine that, \\"While I understand that repellent Labour councils may be the only substitute for alliances with Liberal Democrats and Conservatives, the fall in our Leeds West vote suggests that voters were displeased by a perceived shift to the right by Yorkshire Greens\\".Red Pepper Magazine, Issue 121, June 2005 At the 2005 general election, Wall stood as a candidate for Windsor and received 2.5% of the votes. In November 2005, he was beaten by Keith Taylor in the election to be the Male Principal Speaker of the Green Party, by 851 votes to 803. He was narrowly elected as one of two Principal Speakers of the Green Party of England and Wales in November 2006, alongside Sian Berry. In 2007 he was re-elected as Male Principal Speaker alongside Caroline Lucas, elected to the post of Female Principal Speaker. The position of principal speaker was the closest role to that of leader within the Green Party until 2008. Derek Wall giving a keynote speech at the Green Party of England and Wales conference, Reading, 2008 He was prominent in the Green Empowerment group that campaigned against the creation of a single leader and deputy leader instead of the Principal Speaker system. He attacked the proposal for a referendum in Swansea: > I find the title \\"leader\\" embarrassing: it is so patronising, assuming a > bunch of people have to be \\"led\\", the shepherd label that assumes the > members are sheep. Wall's critique centred on the link between the structure of leadership and ambition of the party; and the likelihood that a Leader coupled with ambition would be part of a project to move the party to the \\"right\\": > Political parties universally tend to attract those addicted to fame and > careerism. ... Clearly, the biggest barrier to green electoral victory is > the lack of proportional representation. Greens have been elected around the > world in countries with PR. ... The fear is that a leader will shift the > party to the right, cutting the Greens' radical edge. ... The call for a > single leader would compromise the party's commitment to radical democracy. > It also suggests a failure to think about strategy in any real sense. The > fear is that it could be part of a more extensive shift towards a new green > politics of shallow environmentalism, rather than a thorough critique of an > unequal, profit-motivated society. He also linked the idea of a leadership structure directly to abuse of power. His September 2007 keynote speech took up this theme: > what is power? You can't touch it or taste it. Sometimes I think you can > smell it, like wealth or sewage, and if it is piled up in one place it > stinks like rotten cod. For it to smell sweet, we need to spread it around. > For power to be creative, we need to spread it around. > Collecting power in one place is like collecting money in a mega billion > bank account, the work of a miser, a misery, a self obsessed fanatic. Green > politics is about giving everyone power. At times, personal attacks surfaced in Wall's comments in the debate. Replying to a Guardian letter from Jonathon Porritt and others supporting leadership, Wall drew parallels with Porritt's own behaviour as a green 'leader': > Jonathon Porritt's call for the Green Party to select a single leader is > flawed. Rather than suggesting the Green Party becomes a little more like > the conventional top down political parties, Jonathon could show a little > more personal leadership. Last year he took 42 flight clocking up air miles > to go to meetings to tell people to cut CO2. I am calling on Jonathon to use > video conferencing a little more and to fly a little less. In the subsequent party-wide referendum, 73% of members polled voted to create a single leader. Wall said of the result, \\"The result of this referendum challenges the Party to create a leadership structure that is true to green ideals. It has put our future leaders on notice that the membership expects a more focused, more effective party, with a leadership team that is truly accountable to the membership in a real and effective manner\\". Nevertheless, in 2010 he declared himself a candidate for the post of deputy leader under the new system, losing to the incumbent Adrian Ramsay. During his Deputy Leader campaign, Wall continued to promote the view that a \\"right\\" wing of the Green party is attempting to subvert its democracy, agreeing that \\"talk of 'modernising' the Green Party [is] actually code for changing inner Party democracy and changing the politics of the Party\\". Nevertheless, Wall's opponents, the joint ticket of Adrian Ramsay and Caroline Lucas, continue to promote both reform of the party and a left-leaning politics.Adrian Ramsay and Caroline Lucas campaign site Derek's defeat was met with disappointment from Green Lib Dems, who cited his defeat as a loss of a \\"good source of ammunition against the [Green] party\\".Comment from Joe Otten on Rupert's Read ==Moving beyond capitalism== ===Strategies=== In a chapter of Babylon and Beyond entitled \\"Life After Capitalism: Alternatives, Structures, Strategies\\", Wall suggests that \\"conventional economics is surprisingly dangerous for a subject normally portrayed as a neutral science\\", and advocates the proposition of \\"solid liveable alternatives\\" by the anti-capitalist movement. Though he does not discount the \\"plots and plans\\" of the corporate lobby, American neo- conservatives, and free market liberals, which are \\"hardly secret\\", he criticises the tendency of many anti-capitalists to be attracted to \\"warm conspiracies\\" which \\"generate a personal enemy with a human face who can be challenged\\". Instead, he wishes to address the \\"structural element\\" of capitalism, drawing on the critical realist philosophy of Roy Bhaskar, who suggests that \\"invisible structures\\", like capitalism and language, shape society but can themselves be changed by human activity. This means that \\"the conspirators construct, where they are successful, new structures, but as capitalists they are themselves bearers of deeper structural imperatives to exploit labour, subjectivity and the earth\\". Stating that \\"history does not march to a predictable narrative\\", Wall criticises the determinism of some Marxists, on the one hand, who promote \\"hyperglobalisation\\" in an attempt to move the world closer to the apparently inevitable socialist order, and, on the other hand, subsistence ecofeminists, who look to turn to clock back to the time of peasant societies. He rejects productivism in favour of \\"in different contexts economic arrangements that fulfil need equitably, develop humanity, sustain ecosystems and lead to cooperation\\". ===Propositions=== Wall first suggests \\"embedded markets\\", embedded in society, with \\"state provision decentralised\\", as a first step to adapt capitalism. He cites the example of the Indian adivasis, who regained the land they originally inhabited and sold tea via the Fair trade system. Here, Wall argues that \\"social preference rather than profit maximisation socialised economic activity\\". He welcomes the movements in Argentina that have seen workers occupy and reopen bankrupt factories. He applauds the work done on creating a \\"decentralised, socialist economy\\" in Cuba and Venezuela. Wall is encouraged by the growth in Green consumerism, noting that \\"we cannot shop or work our way to utopia, but such projects ease present ills and point roughly to a different future\\". Taking on the work of Marx on the distinction between use-values and exchange-values, Wall stresses that \\"exchange values must be rejected\\", so that \\"economics can be bent towards serving the needs of humanity and nature rather than its own violent abstract growth\\". This means building things to last and sharing resources: he advocates the increased use of libraries, permaculture and the localisation of economies where possible. He highlights the Rastafarian notion of 'Ital', a form of localism in which \\"what is sacred is what comes from the earth and is grown locally\\", and where localism and internationalism are mixed \\"without building walls between sects\\" in what Wall calls a \\"worldwide rooted cosmopolitanism\\". Nonetheless, Wall envisages as the ultimate aim the rolling back of both the market and the state. To this end, he wishes to \\"defend, extend and deepen\\" the commons against enclosure as a way of giving people back their means of production. He believes that the extension of the commons provides the best model for consensus-based social and ecological management and sharing. In the same vein, Wall supports Open Source Software as one of the \\"new commons regimes ... created with technological and social change\\", one which \\"is a stunning example of how both the market and the state can be bypassed by cooperative creativity\\". \\"Marx,\\" he quips, \\"would have been a Firefox user\\". ==Non-Violent Direct Action== Wall stresses the importance of combining electoral politics and non-violent direct action to effect change. Babylon and Beyond focuses heavily on unique and creative expressions of anti- capitalist economics and protest, and Wall tells protestors \\"to keep making noise\\". He has cultivated ties with African-American and Afro-Caribbean Green activists and takes a strong interest in the controversial Pennsylvania-based African-American organisation MOVE. From 1995, he helped develop a British- based campaign to free US death row prisoner Mumia Abu-Jamal. ==Zen== Wall practices zazen and is influenced by spirituality through \\"pursuing a pagan appreciation of the living world in a variety of ways\\". In Babylon and Beyond, he argues that Zen acts as a guard against utopianism as it \\"is based on being in the world rather than escaping from it\\". He also links anti-capitalism and Zen, stating, based on the work of anthropologist and economist Marshall Sahlins, that \\"Zen minimises need and provides an alternative road to affluence\\". ==Quotes== * How to be green?

The typical methods of language reform are simplification and linguistic purism. Simplification regularizes vocabulary, grammar, or spelling. Purism aligns the language with a form which is deemed 'purer'. Language reforms are intentional changes to language; this article does not cover natural language change, such as the Great Vowel Shift. ==Simplification== By far the most common language reform is simplification. The most common simplification is spelling reform, however inflection, syntax, vocabulary and word formation can also be targets for simplification. For example, in English, there are many prefixes which mean \\"the opposite of\\", e.g. un-, in-, a(n)-, dis-, and de-. A language reform might propose to replace the redundant prefixes with one, such as un-. ==Purification== Linguistic purism or linguistic protectionism is the prescriptive practice of recognizing one form of a language as purer or of intrinsically higher quality than others. The perceived or actual decline may take the form of change of vocabulary, syncretism of grammatical elements, or loanwords, and in this case, the form of a language reform. ==Examples== Examples of language reforms are: * Belgian (Flemish/Dutch) ‚Äì In 1844 (Jan Frans Willems), 1864 (Matthias de Vries and L.A. te Winkel), 1946 (Marchant), 1996 (Actie) and 2006. * Catalan ‚Äì In 1917 Pompeu Fabra published Diccionari ortogr√†fic, the first Catalan dictionary. The complete Diccionari General de la Llengua Catalana was published in 1931. * Chinese ** (1920s) ‚Äì replaced Classical Chinese with Vernacular Chinese as the standard written language, largely through the efforts of Hu Shih. ** Mandarin was chosen at a committee from several Chinese dialects. ** (1950s PRC) ‚Äì changed the script used to write the standard language by introducing Simplified Chinese characters (later adopted by Singapore and Malaysia, but Traditional Chinese characters remain in use in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and various overseas Chinese communities). * Czech (19th century) ‚Äì The dictionary of Josef Jungmann contributed to the renewal of the vocabulary. In the 1840s the letter w was replaced by v. * Dutch (19th and 20th century) ‚Äî In 1883 (De Vries and Te Winkel), 1934 (Marchant), 1947 (The Green Booklet), 1996 (Actie) and 2006. * Estonian (1910s/1920s) ‚Äì reform movement led by Johannes Aavik and Johannes V. Veski renewed the vocabulary, borrowing a lot of roots from Finnish and other Uralic languages and even inventing some roots. * French (18th, 19th, and 20th century) ‚Äî In 1740, 1762, 1835, 1992 by the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. * German (1901/02) ‚Äì unified the spelling system nationwide (first in Germany, with later adoption by other German-speaking lands). Further reforms were enacted more recently, in the German spelling reform of 1996. * Greek (1970s/1980s) ‚Äì while the written \\"pure\\" language, the Katharevousa was full of Ancient Greek words, the spoken \\"popular\\" language, the Demotic Greek was not. After the fall of the military rule, a law was promulgated, making the latter the written language as well. For example, on Greek coins, the plural of the currency was drachmai (Katharevousa) before and became drachmes (Demotic Greek) after 1982. * Hebrew (1920s) ‚Äì Modern Hebrew was created from Ancient Hebrew by grammatical simplification (especially of the syntax) according to Indo-European models, coinage of new words from Hebrew roots based on European models, and simplification of pronunciation rules. Linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann argues that Modern Hebrew, which he calls \\"Israeli\\", is a Semito-European hybrid, based not only on Hebrew but also on Yiddish and other languages spoken by revivalists.Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns, Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Journal of Language Contact, Varia 2, pp. 40‚Äì67 (2009). Zuckermann therefore endorses the translation of the Hebrew Bible into what he calls \\"Israeli\\".Let my people know! , Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Jerusalem Post, May 18, 2009. * Hungarian (late 18th and early 19th centuries) ‚Äì more than ten thousand words were coined,K√°lm√°n Szily presented approx. 10,000 words in his book A magyar nyelv√∫j√≠t√°s sz√≥t√°ra (\\"Dictionary of Hungarian language reform\\", vol. 1‚Äì2: 1902 and 1908), without aiming to be comprehensive thousands of which are actively used today (see also Ferenc Kazinczy). * Irish (1940s) ‚Äì spelling system greatly simplified: Gaedheal became Gael, and √ì S√©igheadh became √ì S√©. * Japanese (1946) ‚Äì historical kana usage was replaced by modern kana usage, while the kanji system also transformed from Traditional Chinese characters to New Characters. * Norwegian (20th century) ‚Äì as Norway became independent from Denmark (1814), Norwegians wanted a written language closer to spoken Norwegian. The reforms in 1907 and 1917 made Riksm√•l the written standard Norwegian, renamed Bokm√•l in 1929. Bokm√•l and the more vernacular Nynorsk were made closer by a reform in 1938. Today both language forms are written: on Norwegian coins, the name of the country is alternately Norge (Bokm√•l) and Noreg (Nynorsk). * Portuguese (20th century) ‚Äì replaced a cumbersome traditional spelling system with a simplified one (asthma, for instance, became asma and phthysica became t√≠sica). * Romanian (19th century) ‚Äì replaced Cyrillic script with the Latin alphabet, deprecated thousands of Slavic words in favour of Romance words. Romanian has undergone spelling reforms in 1904, 1953, and, most recently, in 1993, with two minor ones in 1964 and 2005. * Russian ‚Äì 1918 ‚Äì Major changes in Russian orthography. Several letters were removed from Russian alphabet. Minor changes in Russian grammar. The reform has simplified some aspects of the language. Other reforms happened in 1708/1710 and 1956. * Serbian (19th century) ‚Äî Slavonic-Serbian, the literary language of Habsburg Serbs, was disused with Vuk Karad≈æiƒá's reforms and standardization as official language of Serbia. * Somali (1970s) ‚Äì modified Latin script developed by a number of leading scholars of Somali, including Musa Haji Ismail Galal, B. W. Andrzejewski and Shire Jama Ahmed for writing the Somali language; made compulsory in 1972 by the President of Somalia, General Mohamed Siad Barre * Turkish (1930s) ‚Äì language and writing system were reformed beginning in the 1920s, such that the older language is called by a different name: Ottoman Turkish. The Ottoman alphabet was based on the Arabic alphabet, which was replaced in 1928 by the new Latin-based Turkish alphabet. Loanwords of Persian and Arabic origin were dropped in favor of native Turkish words or new coinages based on Turkic roots. * Vietnamese (20th century) ‚Äì Classical Chinese lost official status in 1918, and the colonial schools instituted a \\"Franco-Vietnamese Curriculum\\" at this time. Vietnamese was taught using the Latin alphabet, and this form soon became dominant. ==Instances in popular culture== *(Fictional): In George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, English has become Newspeak, a language designed to make official propaganda easy and to make politically undesirable thoughts impossible to express. ==See also== *Coptic pronunciation reform *Spelling reform *English-language spelling reform *Language revival *Language planning *Language policy *Metrication *International Phonetic Association *Constructed language *Gender-neutral language *Newspeak *Diglossia *Otto Basler ==Bibliography== *Geoffrey Lewis, The Turkish Language Reform: A Catastrophic Success, Oxford University Press, 2002, .

Paul Reisch replaced Gil Roman in 1973. They are best known as one-hit wonders for their lone pop hit, \\"Back When My Hair Was Short\\", which peaked at number 40 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in June 1973. On the Cash Box Top 100, the song reached number 25, and spent 15 weeks on the chart. It reached number 37 on the Adult Contemporary chart. In Canada, the song reached number 53. ==Career== The band released a trio of albums in the 1970s. Their first release, on Mercury Records, was 1971's First Stop, credited to \\"Gun Hill Road.\\" The second album, Gunhill Road, was released in 1972 and produced by Kenny Rogers. In 1973, three songs were re-recorded and the album was re-released, after which \\"Back When My Hair was Short\\" became a national hit. The 1972 versions of \\"Back When My Hair was Short\\" and \\"42nd Street\\" had some drug references, while the 1973 re-recordings had some lyric changes and a more up-tempo feel. The album received great reviews, and was often featured on many FM and college radio stations . According to Billboard, \\"Back When My Hair Was Short\\" had the distinction in 1973 of being top 10 in more different markets at more different times than any other record of that year. They were long sought after as performers working with George Carlin, Robert Klein, Poco, Harry Chapin, Jim Croce, John Sebastian, Lily Tomlin, Cheech & Chong, Gordon Lightfoot, Soupy Sales and Bette Midler to name a few. In addition, they appeared on American Bandstand, Midnight Special and other TV programs. On October 24, 2011, the Wounded Bird label reissued the 1973 version of the \\"Gunhill Road\\" album on CD with five bonus tracks: The non-LP tracks \\"Ford Desoto Cadillac\\" and \\"We Can't Ride The Roller Coaster Anymore,\\" and the original 1972 versions of \\"Sailing,\\" \\"42nd Street\\" and \\"Back When My Hair Was Short.\\" On November 4, 2011, Glenn Leopold, Paul Reisch and Steven Goldrich reunited for the first time since 1976 to perform at a benefit in Montclair, N.J. to feed the homeless, and honor their former manager and longtime Bitter End owner Paul Colby. In October 2014, they returned to the Bitter End to perform for the first time in 40 years. The overflow crowd was joined by a multi camera crew, who recorded the entire performance for a documentary to be released in 2015-16. Also in 2014, the group recorded their first album since 1973, aptly titled Every 40 Years, which will be self-released. Starting in 2019, they started recording for their 4th album. The expected release date was scheduled for the early spring, however with the pandemic, the date has been moved up to the summer of 2020. ==References== Category:Rock music groups from New York (state) Category:Kama Sutra Records artists ","title":"Gunhill Road"},{"id":"3255966","text":"Health technology is defined by the World Health Organization as the \\"application of organized knowledge and skills in the form of devices, medicines, vaccines, procedures, and systems developed to solve a health problem and improve quality of lives\\". This includes pharmaceuticals, devices, procedures, and organizational systems used in the healthcare industry, as well as computer-supported information systems. In the United States, these technologies involve standardized physical objects, as well as traditional and designed social means and methods to treat or care for patients. == Development == === Pre-digital Era === During a pre-digital era, patients suffered from inefficient and faulty clinical systems, processes, and conditions. Many medical errors happened in the past due to undeveloped health technologies. Some examples of these medical errors included adverse drug events and alarm fatigue. Alarm fatigue is caused when an alarm is repeatedly triggered or activated and one becomes desensitized to them. As the alarms were sometimes triggered by unimportant events in the past, nurses thought the alarm was not significant. Alarm fatigue is dangerous because it could lead to death and dangerous situations. With technological development, an intelligent program of integration and physiologic sense-making was developed and helped reduce the number of false alarms. Also, with greater investment in health technologies, fewer medical errors happened. Outdated paper records were replaced in many healthcare organizations by electronic health records (EHR). According to studies, this change has brought a lot of changes to healthcare. Drug administration has improved, healthcare providers can now access medical information easier, provide better treatments and faster results, and save more costs. === Improvement === To help promote and expand the adoption of health information technology, Congress passed the HITECH act as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. HITECH stands for Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act. It gave the department of health and human services the authority to improve healthcare quality and efficiency through the promotion of health IT. The act provided financial incentives or penalties to organizations to motivate healthcare providers to improve healthcare. The purpose of the act was to improve quality, safety, efficiency, and ultimately to reduce health disparities. On of the main parts of the HITECH act was setting the meaningful use requirement, which required EHRs to allow for the electronic exchange of health information and to submit clinical information. The purpose of HITECH is to ensure the sharing of electronic information with patients and other clinicians are secure. HITECH also aimed to help healthcare providers have more efficient operations and reduce medical errors. The program consisted of three phases. Phase one aimed to improve healthcare quality, safety and efficiency. Phase two expanded on phase one and focused on clinical processes and ensuring the meaningful use of EHRs. Lastly, phase three focused on using Certified Electronic Health Record Technology (CEHRT) to improve health outcomes. In 2014, the implementation of electronic records in US hospitals rose from a low percentage of 10% to a high percentage of 70%. At the beginning of 2018, healthcare providers who participated in the Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program needed to report on Quality Payment Program requirements. The program focused more on interoperability and aimed to improve patient access to health information. === Privacy of Health Data === Phones that can track one's whereabouts, steps and more can serve as medical devices, and medical devices have much the same effect as these phones. In the research article, Privacy Attitudes among Early Adopters of Emerging Health Technologies by Cynthia Cheung, Matthew Bietz, Kevin Patrick and Cinnamon Bloss discovered people were willing to share personal data for scientific advancements, although they still expressed uncertainty about who would have access to their data. People are naturally cautious about giving out sensitive personal information. Phones add an extra level of threat according to the research article Security in Cloud-Computing-Based Mobile Health. Mobile devices continue to increase in popularity each year. The addition of mobile devices serving as medical devices increases the chances for an attacker to gain unauthorized information. In 2015 the Medical Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) was passed which will be put into play in 2018 pushing towards electronic health records. Health Information Technology: Integration, Patient Empowerment, and Security by K. Marvin provided multiple different polls based on people's views on different types of technology entering the medical field most answers were responded with somewhat likely and very few completely disagreed on the technology being used in medicine. Marvin discusses the maintenance required to protect medical data and technology against cyber attacks as well as providing a proper data backup system for the information. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) also known as Obamacare and health information technology health care is entering the digital era. Although with this development it needs to be protected. Both health information and financial information now made digital within the health industry might become a larger target for cyber-crime. Even with multiple different types of safeguards hackers somehow still find their way in so the security that is in place needs to constantly be updated to prevent these breaches.  Policy  With the increased use of IT systems, privacy violations were increasing rapidly due to the easier access and poor management. As such, the concern of privacy has become an important topic in healthcare. Privacy breaches happen when organizations do not protect the privacy of people‚Äôs data. There are four types of privacy breaches, which include unintended disclosure by authorized personnel, intended disclosure by authorized personnel, privacy data loss or theft, and virtual hacking. It became more important to protect the privacy and security of patients‚Äô data because of the high negative impact on both individuals and organizations. Stolen personal information can be used to open credit cards or other unethical behaviors. Also, individuals have to spend a large amount of money to rectify the issue. The exposure of sensitive health information also can cause negative impacts on individuals‚Äô relationships, jobs, or other personal areas. For the organization, the privacy breach can cause loss of trust, customers, legal actions, and monetary fines. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 HIPAA stands for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. It is a U.S. healthcare legislation to direct how patient data is used and includes two major rules which are privacy and security of data. The privacy rule protects people‚Äôs rights to privacy and security rule determines how to protect people‚Äôs privacy. According to the HIPAA Security Rule, it ensures that protected health information has three characteristics. They are confidentiality, availability, and integrity. Confidentiality indicates keeping the data confidential to prevent data loss or individuals who are unauthorized to access that protected health information. Availability allows people who are authorized to access the systems and networks when and where that information is in fact needed, such as natural disasters. In cases like this, protected health information is mostly backed up on to a separate server or printed out in paper copies, so people can access it. Lastly, Integrity ensures not using inaccurate information and improperly modified data due to a bad design system or process to protect the permanence of the patient data. The consequences of using inaccurate or improperly modified data could become useless or even dangerous. Health Organizations of HIPAA also created administrative safeguards, physical safeguards, technical safeguards, to help protect the privacy of patients. Administrative safeguards typically include security management process, security personnel, information access management, workforce training and management, and evaluation of security policies and procedures. Security management processes are one of the important administrative safeguards‚Äô examples. It is essential to reduce the risks and vulnerabilities of the system. The processes are mostly the standard operating procedures written out as training manuals. The purpose is to educate people on how to handle protected health information in proper behavior. Physical safeguards include lock and key, card swipe, positioning of screens, confidential envelopes, and shredding of paper copies. Lock and key are common examples of physical safeguards. They can limit physical access to facilities. Lock and key are simple, but they can prevent individuals from stealing medical records. Individuals must have an actual key to access to the lock. Lastly, technical safeguards include access control, audit controls, integrity controls, and transmission security. The access control mechanism is a common example of technical safeguards. It allows the access of authorized personnel. The technology includes authentication and authorization. Authentication is the proof of identity that handles confidential information like username and password, while authorization is the act of determining whether a particular user is allowed to access certain data and perform activities in a system like add and delete. === Assessment === The concept of health technology assessment (HTA) was first coined in 1967 by the U.S. Congress in response to the increasing need to address the unintended and potential consequences of health technology, along with its prominent role in society. It was further institutionalized with the establishment of the congressional Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) in 1972-1973. HTA is defined as a comprehensive form of policy research that examines short- and long-term consequences of the application of technology, including benefits, costs, and risks. Due to the broad scope of technology assessment, it requires the participation of individuals besides scientists and health care practitioners such as managers and even the consumers. Several American organizations provide health technology assessments and these include the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Veterans Administration through its VA Technology Assessment Program (VATAP). The models adopted by these institutions vary, although they focus on whether a medical technology being offered is therapeutically relevant. A study conducted in 2007 noted that the assessments still did not use formal economic analyses. Aside from its development, however, assessment in the health technology industry has been viewed as sporadic and fragmented Issues such as the determination of products that needed to be developed, cost, and access, among others, also emerged. These - some argue - need to be included in the assessment since health technology is never purely a matter of science but also of beliefs, values, and ideologies. One of the mechanisms being suggested ‚Äì either as an element of- or an alternative to the current TAs is bioethics, which is also referred to as the \\"fourth-generation\\" evaluation framework. There are at least two dimensions to an ethical HTA. The first involves the incorporation of ethics in the methodological standards employed to assess technologies while the second is concerned with the use of ethical framework in research and judgment on the part of the researchers who produce information used in the industry. === Health technology in the future === Fort Belvoir Community Hospital astounds with groundbreaking technology and devotion to patient care The practice of medicine in the United States is currently in a major transition. This transition is due to many factors, but primarily because of the implementation and integration of health technologies into healthcare. In recent years, the widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHR) has caused a big impact on healthcare. \\"The Digital Doctor: Hope, Hype, and Harm at the Dawn of Medicine's Computer Age,\\" by Robert Wachter, aims to inform readers about this transition. Dr. Wachter has reviewed and made points about the future of health technologies in the book. He states that there will be fewer hospitals in the future. Due to the advancement of technologies, people will be more likely to go to hospitals for major surgeries or critical illness. In the future, nurse call buttons will not be needed in hospitals. Instead, robots will deliver medication, take care of patients, and administer the system. In the future, the electronic health record will look different. Healthcare providers will be able to enter the notes via speech-to-text transcriptions in real-time. Dr. Wachter stated that information will be edited collaboratively across the patient-care team to improve the quality. Also, natural language processing will be more developed to help parse out keywords. In the future, patient data will reside in the cloud. Patients will be able to access their data from any device or location. The data is also accessible for authorized providers and individuals. In the future, big data analysis will constantly be improving. Artificial Intelligence and machine learning will be constantly improving and developing as it receives new data. Alerts will also be more intelligent and efficient than the current systems. ==Medical technology== Medical technology, or \\"Medtech\\", encompasses a wide range of healthcare products and is used to treat diseases and medical conditions affecting humans. Such technologies are intended to improve the quality of healthcare delivered through earlier diagnosis, less invasive treatment options and reduction in hospital stays and rehabilitation times. Recent advances in medical technology have also focused on cost reduction. Medical technology may broadly include medical devices, information technology, biotech, and healthcare services. The impacts of medical technology involve social and ethical issues. For example, physicians can seek objective information from technology rather than read subjective patient reports. A major driver of the sector's growth is the consumerization of Medtech. Supported by the widespread availability of smartphones and tablets, providers can reach a large audience at low cost, a trend that stands to be consolidated as wearable technologies spread throughout the market. In the years 2010-2015, venture funding has grown 200%, allowing US$11.7 billion to flow into health tech businesses from over 30,000 investors in the space. === Types of Technology === Medical technology has evolved into smaller portable devices, for instance, smartphones, touchscreens, tablets, laptops, digital ink, voice and face recognition and more. With this technology, innovations like electronic health records (EHR), health information exchange (HIE), Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN), personal health records (PHRs), patient portals, nanomedicine, genome-based personalized medicine, Geographical Positioning System (GPS), radio frequency identification (RFID), telemedicine, clinical decision support (CDS), mobile home health care and cloud computing came to exist. Medical imaging and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been long used and proven Medical Technologies for medical research, patient reviewing, and treatment analyzing. With the advancement of imagining technologies, including the use of faster and more data, higher resolution images, and specialist automation software, the capabilities of medical imaging technology are growing and yielding better results. As the imaging hardware and software evolve this means that patients will need to use less contrasting agents, and also spend less time and money. 3D printing is another major development in healthcare. It can be used to produce specialized splints, prostheses, parts for medical devices and inert implants. The end goal of 3D printing is being able to print out customized replaceable body parts. In the following section, it will explain more about 3D printing in healthcare. New types of technologies also include artificial intelligence and robots.  3D printing  3D-printing Sliperiet 3D printing is the use of specialized machines, software programs and materials to automate the process of building certain objects. It is having a rapid growth in the prosthesis, medical implants, novel drug formulations and the bioprinting of human tissues and organs. Companies such as Surgical Theater, provide new technology that is capable of capturing 3D virtual images of patients' brains to use as practice for operations. 3D printing allows medical companies to produce prototypes to practice before an operation created with artificial tissue. 3D printing technologies are great for bio-medicine because the materials that are used to make allow the fabrication with control over many design features. 3D printing also has the benefits of affordable customization, more efficient designs, and saving more time. 3D printing is precise to design pills to house several drugs due to different release times. The technology allows the pills to transport to the targeted area and degrade safely in the body. As such, pills can be designed more efficiently and conveniently. In the future, doctors might be giving a digital file of printing instructions instead of a prescription. Besides, 3D printing will be more useful in medical implants. An example includes a surgical team that has designed a tracheal splint made by 3D printing to improve the respiration of a patient. This example shows the potential of 3D printing, which allows physicians to develop new implant and instrument designs easily. Overall, in the future of medicine, 3D printing will be crucial as it can be used in surgical planning, artificial and prosthetic devices, drugs, and medical implants.  Artificial Intelligence  Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a program that enables computers to sense, reason, act and adapt. AI is not new, but it is growing rapidly and tremendously. AI can now deal with large data sets, solve problems, and provide more efficient operation. AI will be more potential in healthcare because it provides easier accessibility of information, improves healthcare, and reduce cost. There are different factors that drive AI in healthcare, but the two most important are economics and the advent of big data analytics. Costs, new payment options, and people's desire to improve health outcomes are the primary economic drivers of the AI. Based on the reading, AI can save $150 million annually in the US by 2026. Also, AI growth is expected to reach $6.6 million by 2021. Big data analytics is another big driver because we are in the age of big data. The data is extremely helpful to assist the integration of AI in healthcare because it ensures the execution of complex tasks, quality, and efficiency.  Applications of Artificial Intelligence  AI brings many benefits to the healthcare industry. AI helps to detect diseases, administer chronic conditions, deliver health services, and discover the drug. Also, AI has the potential to address important health challenges. In healthcare organizations, AI is able to plan and relocate resources. AI is able to match patients with healthcare providers that meet their needs. AI also helps improve the healthcare experience by using an app to identify patients' anxieties. In medical research, AI helps to analyze and evaluate the patterns and complex data. For instance, AI is important in drug discovery because it can search relevant studies and analyze different kinds of data. In clinical care, AI helps to detect diseases, analyze clinical data, publications, and guidelines. As such, AI aids to find the best treatments for the patients. Other uses of AI in clinical care include medical imaging, echocardiography, screening, and surgery.  Education  Medical virtual reality provides doctors multiple surgical scenarios that could happen and allows them to practice and prepare themselves for these situations. It also permits medical students a hands-on experience of different procedures without the consequences of making potential mistakes. ORamaVR is one of the leading companies that employ such medical virtual reality technologies to transform medical education (knowledge) and training (skills) to improve patient outcomes, reduce surgical errors and training time and democratize medical education and training.  Robots  Modern robotics have made huge progress and contribution to healthcare. Robots can help doctors in performing variety tasks. Robotics adoption is increasing tremendously in hospitals . The following are different ways to improve healthcare by using robots: Robotic Spinal Surgery Surgical robots are one of the robotic systems, which allows a surgeon to bend and rotate tissues in a more flexible and efficient way. The system is equipped with a 3D magnification vision system that can translate the hand movements of the surgeon to be precise in-order to perform a surgery with minimal incisions. Other robotics systems include the ability to diagnose and treat cancers. Many scientists began working on creating a next-generation robot system to assist the surgeon in performing knee and hip replacement surgeries. Assistant robots will also be important to help reduce the workload for regular medical staff. They can help nurses with simple and time-consuming tasks like carrying multiple racks of medicines, lab specimen or other sensitive materials. Shortly, robotic pills are expected to reduce the number of surgeries. They can be moved inside a patient and delivered to the desired area. In addition, they can conduct biopsies, film the area and clear clogged arteries. Overall, medical robots are extremely useful in assisting physicians; however, it might take time to be professionally trained working with medical robots and for the robots to respond to a clinician‚Äôs instructions. As such, many researchers and startups were working constantly to provide solutions to these challenges. === Assistive Technologies === Assistive technologies are products designed to provide accessibility to individuals who have physical or cognitive problems or disabilities. They aim to improve the quality of life with assistive technologies. The range of assistive technologies is broad, ranging from low- tech solutions to physical hardware, to technical devices. There are four areas of assistive technologies, which include visual impairment, hearing impairment, physical limitations, cognitive limitations. There are many benefits of assistive technologies. They enable individuals to care for themselves, work, study, access information easily, improve independence and communication, and lastly participate fully in community life. === Consumer- driven healthcare software === As part of an ongoing trend towards consumer- driven healthcare, websites or apps which provide more information on health care quality and price to help patients choose their providers have grown. As of 2017, the sites with the most number of reviews in descending order included Healthgrades, Vitals.com, and RateMDs.com. Yelp, Google, and Facebook also host reviews with a large amount of traffic, although as of 2017 they had fewer medical reviews per doctor. Disputes around online reviews can lead to websites by health professionals alleging defamation. Patient safety organizations and government programs which have historically assessed quality have made their data more accessible over the internet; notable examples include the HospitalCompare by CMS and the LeapFrog Group's hospitalsafetygrade.org. Patient-oriented software may also help in other ways, including general education and appointments. Disclosure of legal disputes including medical license complaints or malpractice lawsuits has also been made easier. Every state discloses license status and at least some disciplinary action to the public, but as of 2018, this was not accessible via the internet for a few states. Consumers can look up medical licenses in a national database, DocInfo.org, maintained by the medical licensing organizations which contains limited details. Other tools include DocFinder at docfinder.docboard.org and certificationmatters.org from the American Board of Medical Specialties. In some cases more information is available from a mailed or walk-in request than the internet; for example, the Medical Board of California removes dismissed accusations from website profiles, but these are still available from a written or walk-in request, or a lookup in a separate database. The trend to disclosure is controversial and generate significant public debate, particularly about opening up the National Practitioner Data Bank. In 1996, Massachusetts became the first state to require detailed disclosure of malpractice claims. === Self-Monitoring === Smartphones, tablets, and wearable computers have allowed people to monitor their health. These devices run numerous applications that are designed to provide simple health services and the monitoring of one's health. An example of this is Fitbit, a fitness tracker that is worn on the user's wrist. This wearable technology allows people to track their steps, heart rate, floors climbed, miles walked, active minutes, and even sleep patterns. The data collected and analyzed allow users not just to keep track of their health but also help manage it, particularly through its capability to identify health risk factors. There is also the case of the Internet, which serves as a repository of information and expert content that can be used to \\"self-diagnose\\" instead of going to their doctor. For instance, one need only enumerate symptoms as search parameters at Google and the search engine could identify the illness from the list of contents uploaded to the World Wide Web, particularly those provided by expert/medical sources. These advances may eventually have some effect on doctor visits from patients and change the role of the health professionals from \\"gatekeeper to secondary care to facilitator of information interpretation and decision-making.\\" Apart from basic services provided by Google in Search, there are also companies such as WebMD that already offer dedicated symptom-checking apps. === Technology testing === All medical equipment introduced commercially must meet both United States and international regulations. The devices are tested on their material, effects on the human body, all components including devices that have other devices included with them, and the mechanical aspects. The Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 was created to speed up the FDA's approval process of medical technology by introducing sponsor user fees for a faster review time with predetermined performance targets for review time. In addition, 36 devices and apps were approved by the FDA in 2016. == Careers == There are numerous careers to choose from in health technology in the USA. Listed below are some job titles and average salaries. * Athletic Trainer,Mean Salary: $41,340. Athletic trainers treat athletes and other individuals who have sustained injuries. They also teach people how to prevent injuries. They perform their job under the supervision of physicians. * Dental Hygienist, Mean Salary: $67,340. Dental hygienists provide preventive dental care and teach patients how to maintain good oral health. They usually work under dentists' supervision. * Clinical Laboratory Scientists, Technicians, and Technologists, Mean Salary: $51,770. Lab technicians and technologists perform laboratory tests and procedures. Technicians work under the supervision of a laboratory technologist or laboratory manager. * Nuclear Medicine Technologist, Mean Salary: $67,910. Nuclear medicine technologists prepare and administer radiopharmaceuticals, radioactive drugs, to patients to treat or diagnose diseases. * Pharmacy Technician, Mean Salary: $28,070. Pharmacy technicians assist pharmacists with the preparation of prescription medications for customers. === Allied Professions === The term medical technology may also refer to the duties performed by clinical laboratory professionals or medical technologists in various settings within the public and private sectors. The work of these professionals encompasses clinical applications of chemistry, genetics, hematology, immunohematology (blood banking), immunology, microbiology, serology, urinalysis, and miscellaneous body fluid analysis. Depending on location, educational level, and certifying body, these professionals may be referred to as biomedical scientists, medical laboratory scientists (MLS), medical technologists (MT), medical laboratory technologists and medical laboratory technicians. ==References== Category:Health care occupations Category:Biomedical engineering *United States Category:Healthcare in the United States ","title":"Health technology"},{"id":"3255973","text":"Elmar Altvater (24 August 1938 in Kamen, Province of Westphalia ‚Äì 1 May 2018)https://www.rosalux.de/news/id/38763/elmar-altvater/ was Professor of Political Science at the Otto-Suhr-Institut of the Free University of Berlin, before retiring on 30 September 2004.

At the Otto- Suhr-Institut, he was active in socialist research groups, working with among others Klaus Busch, Wolfgang Schoeller and Frank Seelow, and he gained fame as one of Germany's most important Marxist philosophers, who strongly influenced the political and economic theory of the 1968 generation of radicals. His analysis, centered on the logic of capital accumulation crisis in state interventions is key to the Marxist theory of \\"state-derivationism.\\"Barrow, C.W. (1991). Critical Theories of the State: Marxist, Neo-Marxist, Post- Marxist. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, pg. 79. Altvater argues that the state performs four general maintenance functions particular capitalists cannot undertake: providing an initial legal system with property and contract law, regulating the class struggle between workers and owners of capital, enforcing terms of international trade and market expansion through military presence, and providing infrastructure.Altvater, E. (1973). \\"Notes on Some Problems of State Interventionism (I).\\" Kapitalistate I: pg. 97-108. In 1970, he co-founded the German journal PROKLA - Journal for Critical Social Science http://www.prokla.de/, the Publication, in German of which he remains an editor. In 1971 he became university professor in political economy at the Otto-Suhr-Institut. Apart from questions of development theory, the debt crisis, and the regulation of markets, he remains preoccupied with the effects of capitalist economies on the environment. Altvater was a noted critic of \\"political economy\\" and author of numerous writings on globalization and critiques of capitalism. A standard work is his book The Limits of Globalization (1996), written with his companion Birgit Mahnkopf.http://d-nb.info/gnd/115428844, listings in the German National Library, Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Altvater supported the German Greens for some time, but after the military intervention in Kosovo (which as a member of the governing coalition the party had to support) increasingly maintained a critical distance. He was a member of the Bundestag Commission of Inquiry The World Economy - Challenges and Answers (1999‚Äì2002). Altvater was a supporter of ATTAC (he was a member of its Scientific Advisory Board) and the World Social Forum. Altvater has coined the term \\"Capitalocene\\", which is used by environmentalists as an alternative to the Anthropocene. == Primary literature == * 1969: Die Weltw√§hrungskrise. * 1969: Gesellschaftliche Produktion und √∂konomische Rationalit√§t - Externe Effekte und zentrale Planung im Wirtschaftssystem des Sozialismus. * 1979: Vom Wirtschaftswunder zur Wirtschaftskrise, Berlin (West).(with J√ºrgen Hoffmann and Willi Semmler) * 1983: Alternative Wirtschaftspolitik jenseits des Keynesianismus - Wirtschaftspolitische Optionen der Gewerkschaften in Westeuropa.

Other sources report a total loss of 4150 people, and 180 million people were affected. Around were evacuated, and 13.3 million houses were damaged or destroyed. ==Yangtze River flood== The main cause of the flood was due to above average rainfall in the region for several months before and during the summer of 1998. Most areas saw double the normal amount of rainfall during the rainy season, with certain regions seeing rainfall levels as much as nearly three times the historical average. Combined with above average rainfall since the previous winter, this pushed water levels to above cautionary levels. The floods can be split into three general stages, beginning when one of the strongest subtropical highs in history arrived in the Yangtze River Basin during mid-June and lingered, providing sustained heavy rainfall for a period of roughly two weeks. As much as 1000 mm of precipitation was seen in some locations. After briefly shifting north, the same system eventually returned to the region in mid-July. Although the system had weakened, rainfall during this period was more intense and localized. During this second period of rain, many surrounding lakes and rivers broke record high water levels and overflowed into the Yangtze River, causing a sudden sharp rise in water levels. Another 300-500 mm of rain was seen across several areas during this second phase, causing significant damage as it flowed into villages and towns. The final period of rainfall occurred in August, with an average of 150-200 mm of rainfall seen in most regions. Although the water had begun to subside at this point, this extra rainfall caused further damage to homes and farmland in the surrounding areas. It was also during this period that the dikes began to break, causing further death and widespread damage to property. ==See also== *1931 China floods *List of natural disasters by death toll *Natural disasters in China *Songhua River *Tofu-dreg project *Yangtze ==References== ==External links== *1998 Changjiang Flooding Mini-report (Archived 2009-10-22) ( Archived 2009-10) *China: Yangtze River Flood (July-August 1998) ESA Earthnet Online Earth Observation Category:Jiang Zemin Category:Yangtze River floods Yangtze Yangtze Yangtze Category:June 1998 events in Asia Category:July 1998 events in Asia Category:August 1998 events in Asia Category:September 1998 events in Asia ","title":"1998 China floods"},{"id":"3256020","text":"Cranborne Hundred was a hundred in the county of Dorset, England, containing the following parishes: *Ashmore *Belchalwell (divided between Okeford Fitzpaine and Fifehead Neville 1884) *Cranborne (part) *East Woodyates (created 1858) *Edmondsham (part) *Farnham *Hampreston (part; entire from the 1860s, when the other part was transferred from Hampshire) *Pentridge *Shillingstone *Tarrant Gunville *Tarrant Rushton *Tollard Royal (divided between Dorset and Wiltshire until the 1880s, when the Dorset part was transferred to Wiltshire) *Turnworth *West Parley *Witchampton :(Alderholt and Verwood were created from Cranborne in 1894) ==See also== *List of hundreds in Dorset ==Sources== *Boswell, Edward, 1833: The Civil Division of the County of Dorset (published on CD by Archive CD Books Ltd, 1992) *Hutchins, John, History of Dorset, vols 1-4 (3rd ed 1861‚Äì70; reprinted by EP Publishing, Wakefield, 1973) *Mills, A.

The partisan unit was named after the Bielskis, a family of Polish Jews who organized and led the organization. The Bielski partisans spent more than two years living in the forest. By the end of the war they numbered as many as 1,236 members, most of whom were non-combatants, including children and the elderly. The Bielski partisans are seen by many Jews as heroes for having led as many refugees as they did away from the perils of war and the Holocaust. However, as their relations with the non- Jewish population were strained and occasionally violent, their wartime record has been the subject of some controversy in Poland.Kazimierz Krajewski ‚Äì \\"Op√≥r\\"? \\"Odwet\\"? Czy po prostu \\"polityka historyczna\\"? nr 3/2009 - Instytut Pamiƒôci Narodowej page 105 ==Background== Before World War II, the Bielski family had been millers and grocers in Stankiewicze (Stankievichy), near Nowogr√≥dek, an area that at the outbreak of the war belonged to Poland and in September 1939 was occupied by the Soviet Union (cf. Polish September Campaign and Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)) in accord with the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union. Before the war, Tuvia Bielski had received training in the Polish Army. After performing reserve duty, he engaged in trade, eventually becoming a smuggler.Gazeta Wyborcza - 12 January 2009 Piotr Gluchowski, Marcin Kowalski< PIOTR G≈ÅUCHOWSKI, MARCIN KOWALSKI Wojna polsko-ruska pod bokiem niemieckim Under the Soviet occupation of eastern Poland, the remainder of the Bielski family served as low-level administrators for the Soviets, with Tuvia Bielski becoming a Soviet commissar.Snyder, Timothy, \\"Caught Between Hitler & Stalin\\", The New York Review of Books, vol. 56, no. 7 (30 April 2009), (restricted) This strained the Bielskis' relations with local Poles, who were subjected to Soviet repressions. During Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union beginning 22 June 1941, Nowogr√≥dek became a Jewish ghetto, as the Germans took over the area and implemented their genocidal policies (see Holocaust in Poland and Holocaust in Belarus). ==Partisans== ===Formation=== The four Bielski brothers, Tuvia, Alexander (also known as \\"Zus\\"), Asael, and Aron, fled into the nearby forests after their parents and other family members had been killed in the ghetto on 8 December 1941. In the spring of 1942, together with 13 ghetto neighbors, they formed the nucleus of a partisan combat unit. The unit originally numbered some 40 people, but quickly grew. The unit's commander was the oldest brother, Tuvia, who had served in the Polish Army from 1927 to 1929, rising to the rank of corporal. He had been interested in the Zionist youth movement. He sent emissaries to infiltrate the area's ghettos, recruiting new members to the unit, which was sheltering in the Naliboki Forest. Hundreds of men, women, and children eventually found their way to the Bielski encampment; at its peak, the unit hosted 1,236 people, 70 per cent of them women, children and elderly; no one was turned away. About 150 people engaged in armed operations. ===Organization=== The partisans lived in underground dugouts (zemlyankas) or bunkers. In addition, several utility structures were built: a kitchen, a mill, a bakery, a bathhouse, a medical clinic for the sick and wounded and a quarantine hut for those who suffered from infectious diseases such as typhus. Herds of cows supplied milk. Artisans made goods and carried out repairs, providing the combatants with logistical support that later served the Soviet partisan units in the vicinity as well. More than 125 workers toiled in the workshops, which became famous among partisans far beyond the Bielski base. Tailors patched up old clothing and stitched together new garments; shoemakers fixed old and made new footwear; leather-workers laboured on belts, bridles and saddles. A metalworking shop established by Shmuel Oppenheim repaired damaged weapons and constructed new ones from spare parts. A tannery, constructed to produce the hide for cobblers and leather workers, became a de facto synagogue because several tanners were devout Hasidic Jews. Carpenters, hat-makers, barbers and watchmakers served their own community and guests. The camp's many children attended class in the dugout set up as a school. The camp even had its own jail and court of law.Peter Duffy, The Bielski Brothers. New York, HarperCollins, 2003, , pp. 214-17. Some accounts note the inequality between well-off partisans and poor inhabitants of the camp. Piotr Zychowicz, \\"Bielski pomaga≈Ç ≈ªydom, ale te≈º ich wykorzystywa≈Ç\\" (\\"Bielski Helped the Jews, but Also Exploited Them\\") , Rzeczpospolita (The Republic), 23 January 2009. According to one of Tuvia Bielski's cousins who lived in the camp, relayed to her daughter, women were forced to strip naked upon entry and give up their underwear as a form of \\"entry ticket\\". ===Activities=== The Bielski unit's partisans were primarily concerned with survival. Due to their poor equipment and training, they were not assigned main combat roles. Instead, its members operated field kitchens, hospitals, and bakeries and provided tailoring and cobbling services for Soviet soldiers.Kazimierz Krajewski, \\"\\"Op√≥r\\"? \\"Odwet\\"? Czy po prostu \\"polityka historyczna\\"?\\", Instytut Pamiƒôci Narodowej, no. 3/2009, p. 104. Their main task, though, was forced requisitioning of food and other supplies from the local population. The Bielski partisan group decided to prioritize saving Jews;in a Twilight World: Partisan and Anti-Partisan Warfare in Eastern Europe, 1939-45 , chapter by Kenneth Slepyan, Palgrave Macmillan, pages 52-53 Tuvia Bielski said \\"I would rather save one old Jewish woman than kill ten German soldiers\\".The Morality of Self-defense and Military Action: The Judeo-Christian Tradition , David B. Kopel, Praeger, page 119 The Bielski partisans' targets also included the Germans and their collaborators who had betrayed or killed Jews, such as Belarusian volunteer policemen and local inhabitants, as well as their families. In one case, the Bielski partisans killed some 12 people from a Belorussian family who had betrayed 2 Jewish girls to the Germans. In another, the Bielski partisans killed several collaborators whose names they extracted from Ivan Tzwirkes, a collaborator with a Jewish wife.\\"Nowogrodek: The Story of a Shtetl.\\" Yad Vashem Studies 35.2 (2007): 59.M, Yehuda Bauer. They also conducted sabotage. At the beginning of 1943 German planes dropped leaflets in the area promising a 50,000 Reichsmark reward for assistance in the capture of Tuvia Bielski; this figure was subsequently doubled to 100,000 RM. The leaflets, which were intended for the Christian population, also reached Jews and provided motivation and courage to attempt an escape to the forest camp.Defiance , Oxford University Press, Nechama Tec, 2009, page 315 In August 1943 the Germans conducted a major clearing operation, Operation Hermann (also dubbed the \\"big hunt\\"), against villages and partisan groups in the Naliboki Forest. Partisan groups in the forest and surrounding villages suffered major casualties. The Bielski partisans, however, split into small groups and assembled back in their former base in the Jasinowo forest.Defiance , Oxford University Press, Nechama Tec, 1993, pages 116-124 The communities around the Naliboki forest were devastated, the Germans deported the non-Jewish residents fit for work to Germany for slave labor and murdered most of the rest. Prior to the manhunt, homeless refugees were mainly Jews who had escaped the ghetto, but in the fall of 1943 non-Jewish Belorussian, Polish, and Roma who managed to flee roamed in the forest. Many joined partisan units, special family camps set up by the Soviets, and some joined the Bielski group who returned to the area and accepted anyone willing to join. While the Germans wrecked many communities, much was left behind in and around the forest that could sustain life. Fields, orchards, and beehives all had their produce and farm animals roamed the area around the forest. While the buildings of the villages were partially demolished, much of the building material was left usable as well as some household goods. The Bielski group foraged and gathered much of these materials, and tended to the fields.Defiance , Oxford University Press, Nechama Tec, 1993, pages 127-129 The Bielski partisans eventually became affiliated with Soviet organisations in the vicinity of the Naliboki Forest under General Platon (Vasily Yefimovich Chernyshev). Several attempts by Soviet commanders to absorb the Bielski fighters into their units were resisted, and the Jewish partisan group retained its integrity and remained under Tuvia Bielski's command. This allowed him to continue his mission of protecting Jewish lives and engaging in combat activity, but it would prove a problem later on. In September 1943 General Platon ordered the splitting of the group. The first group, named Ordzhonikidze (a famous Georgian communist), was a 180 mainly Jewish fighting detachment (commanded by a non-Jew Lyushenko). All the rest were designated as Kalinin (named for the Soviet head of state) and included some 800 people, including 160 armed defenders, that were based in Naliboki forest and provided services to other partisan groups in the forest as well as participating in sabotage and diversionary actions. On 1 April 1944, the group was renamed as the Bielski otriad. Like other Soviet-affiliated partisan groups in the area, the Bielski partisans raided nearby villages and forcibly seized food; on occasion, peasants who refused to share their food with the partisans were subjected to violence, even murder. This caused hostility toward the partisans on the part of the peasants, though some willingly helped the Jewish partisans. Other peasants informed on the Jewish partisans in the forests to the Germans.http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/education/newsletter/28/bielski_brothers.asp#09 The International School for Holocaust Studies Solidarity in the Forest ‚Äì The Bielski Brothers By Franziska Reiniger As the region was already pacified by the Germans and many villages were burned to the ground, the local population was in an especially dire situation.Kazimierz Krajewski ‚Äì \\"Op√≥r\\"? \\"Odwet\\"?

Kopel, Praeger, page 119 In total, the Bielski partisans claimed during the war to have killed 381 enemy fighters (in part, jointly with Soviet groups) and to have lost 50 members.Duffy, Peter, The Bielski Brothers. New York: HarperCollins, 2003. . p. 281: \\"The numbers are cited in the partisan histories of Ordzhonikidze (Fond 3618; Opus I; File 23) and Kalinin (Fond 3500; Opus 4; File 272) in the Minsk archives. The Kalinin history is also available at Yad Vashem (M.41/120).The Holocaust: An Encyclopedia and Document Collection , ABC-Clio, Paul R. Bartrop, Michael Dickerman, page 83 According to , a November 1943 report from Tuvia Bielski to the Soviet command stated that in two years of operations Bielski Otriad killed 14 Germans, 17 policemen, and 33 spies and provocateurs (Krajewski thinks these likely included peasants unsympathetic to Soviet partisans or who had resisted being plundered). In his opinion, 14 Germans killed was not a substantial number for a two-year period. Further, Krajewski believes these numbers to be overestimated. === Relations with other groups === The Bielski partisans had friendly relations with the local Home Army commander, 2nd Lt. Kacper Mi≈Çaszewski. Mi≈Çaszewski, a native of the region, located his camp a kilometer from the Bielski camp, and according to Tuvia Bielski's memoirs felt a deep sympathy for the Bielski group because it sheltered women, elderly, and children. In August 1943 the Germans conducted a large-scale pacification operation in the Naliboki Forest, inflicting losses on civilians, Polish Home Army units, Soviet partisans, and the Bielski group.The Polish Underground and the Jews, 1939-1945, Cambridge University Press, Joshua D. Zimmerman, , pages 273-275Defiance , Oxford University Press, Nechama Tec, 1993, pages 114-117 Following the German action, in which the Home Army unit lost 120 men and was forced out of the forest, Mi≈Çaszewski was replaced with Adolf Pilch, who was placed in charge of the Stolpce battalion. By September 1943, the Soviets had begun a policy of confrontation against the Polish anti-Nazi underground, which it saw as a threat to their aims in Eastern Poland. In December, the Soviets drew Plich's men into a trap by inviting them to \\"friendly talks\\", then surrounded Pilch's men and threatened to execute kidnapped Polish officers unless the unit surrendered. Bielski's unit participated in this operation. Some 135 Polish soldiers and 9 officers were arrested. However, Pilch managed to evade capture along with 50 others; according to Pilch the Bielski partisans were too distracted with pillaging the Polish camp in search of valuables, which allowed him to escape capture. Pilch's unit would continue to fight the Soviet partisans.Defiance , Oxford University Press, Nechama Tec, 1993, pages 153 Fighting on the Soviet side, the Bielski partisans took part in clashes between Polish and Soviet forces.The True Story of the Bielski Brothers Prawdziwa historia Bielskich , Gazeta Wyborcza, 6 January 2009 On 5 March 1944, Zus's fighter detachment and Soviet forces jointly attacked a group of Polish fighters, killing 47 and injuring 20 more. On 22 March 20 Jewish fighters managed to ambush a Nazi convoy and kill 12.The Bielski Brothers: The True Story of Three Men Who Defied the Nazis, Built a Village in the Forest, and Saved 1,200 Jews, Peter Duffy, 2004, page 246 According to Kazimierz Krajewski, in May 1944, the village of Kamie≈Ñ in Stolpce was attacked by a force including Bielski partisans; 23 Home Army soldiers and 20 civilians were killed. ===Internal conflict=== Tuvia Bielski was known for his authoritarian leadership style and was constantly involved in power struggles with other members of the unit. Israel Kessler (who tried to organize a group of people to leave the Bielski camp and form their own unit)in the Shadow of the Red Banner: Soviet Jews in the War Against Nazi Germany , Yitzhak Arad, pages 298-299 and others sent letters to General Platon and other Soviet officials that Tuvia Bielski was holding gold and jewelry in contradiction to partisan orders to hand these over to headquarters. A unit member, Stepan Szupien, suggested to the Soviets that they arrest and execute Bielski, accusing him of confiscating money under the pretext of buying weapons.Kazimierz Krajewski, \\"Op√≥r\\"? \\"Odwet\\"? Czy po prostu \\"polityka historyczna\\"? Instytut Pamiƒôci Narodowej, no. 3/2009, pp. 106-7. The Soviet command, concerned about the unit's leadership, began an internal investigation into an alleged protection racket conducted by Bielski. Chernyshev cleared Bielski of the charges following an investigation.Defiance , Nechama Tec, page 182-3 Bielski viewed Kessler's actions as rebellion, put Kessler on trial, and executed him. According to witness Estera Gorodejska, a drunk Bielski personally executed Kessler with three shots. Later Bielski ordered the destruction of Kessler's grave.

Following one final parade, they disbanded.Saving One's Own: Jewish Rescuers During the Holocaust , Mordecai Paldiel, University of Nebraska Press, page 94 Despite their previous cooperation with the Soviets, relations quickly worsened. Piotr G≈Çuchowski, Marcin Kowalski, Wojna polsko-ruska pod bokiem niemieckim , Gazeta Wyborcza, 13 January 2009 The NKVD started interrogating the Bielski brothers about the rumors of loot they had reportedly collected during the war and about their failure to \\"implement socialist ideals in the camp\\". Asael Bielski was conscripted into the Soviet Red Army and died in the Battle of K√∂nigsberg in 1945. The remaining brothers escaped Soviet-controlled lands, emigrating to the West. Tuvia's cousin, Yehuda Bielski, was sought by the NKVD for having been an officer in the pre-war Polish Army but managed to escape with Tuvia's help and made his way to Hungary and then to Israel. ==Postwar== After the war, Tuvia Bielski returned to Poland, then emigrated to present-day Israel in 1945. Tuvia and Zus eventually settled in New York where they operated a successful trucking business. When Tuvia died in 1987, he was buried in Long Island, New York, but a year later, at the urging of surviving partisans in Israel, he was exhumed and given a hero's funeral at Har HaMenuchot, the hillside graveyard in Jerusalem. His wife, Lilka, was buried beside him in 2001. The last living Bielski brother, Aron Bielski, emigrated to the US in 1951. He changed his name to \\"Aron Bell.\\" The remainder of the Bell family now lives in upstate New York and California. Aron lives in Florida. None of the Bielskis ever sought any recognition or reward for their actions. Yehuda Bielski, their first cousin and fellow partisan, moved to Israel to fight in the Irgun. ==Books and film== Two English language books have focused on the Bielski story: Defiance (1993) by Nechama Tec and The Bielski Brothers (2004) by Peter Duffy. The group is also mentioned in numerous books about this period in history. Fugitives of the Forest: The Heroic Story of Jewish Resistance and Survival During the Second World War, by Allan Levine (first published 1998, 2008 reissue, by Lyons Press),Levine, Allan. Fugitives of the Forest. New York: Lyons Press, 2008. tells the story of Jewish fighters and refugees in forests across Europe, including the Bielski partisans. With Courage Shall We Fight: The Memoirs and Poetry of Holocaust Resistance Fighters Frances \\"Fruma\\" Gulkowich Berger and Murray \\"Motke\\" Berger tells the story of two Bielski Brigade fighters before, during and after the war. In 2006, the History Channel aired a documentary titled The Bielski Brothers: Jerusalem in the Woods, written and directed by filmmaker Dean Ward. A book (January 2009) in Polish by two reporters from Gazeta Wyborcza, Odwet: Prawdziwa historia braci Bielskich (Revenge: The True Story of the Bielski Brothers) was accused of consisting of plagiarism and withdrawn. The feature film Defiance, co-written, produced and directed by Edward Zwick, was released internationally in January 2009. It stars Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber, Jamie Bell and George MacKay as Tuvia, Zus, Asael and Aron Bielski respectively. It opened to mixed reviews and raised questions about the roles various groups played during the war. ==See also== * Abba Kovner * Kastner's Train * Nakam * The Pianist (2002 film) * World War II Behind Closed Doors: Stalin, the Nazis and the West * List of Holocaust films ==Notes== ==References== * Alperowitz, Yitzchak. \\"Tuvia Bielski\\", in Encyclopaedia of the Holocaust vol. 1, p. 215‚Äì16.

Henri-Jacques-Guillaume Clarke, 1st Count of Hunebourg, 1st Duke of Feltre (17 October 1765 ‚Äì 28 October 1818), born to Irish parents from Lisdowney, Co. Kilkenny, in Landrecies, was a politician and Marshal of France. Clarke was one of the most influential and charismatic Franco-Irish generals in the French army during the Napoleonic period. He had close links to the Irish Brigade of France. His father served in Dillon's Regiment (where Clarke himself served for a time) and his mother's father and several uncles served in Clare's Regiment. With the outbreak of the French Revolution, Clarke served in the early French Revolutionary Wars in the Army of the Rhine, and by 1793 had been promoted to g√©n√©ral de brigade. In 1795 Clarke was briefly arrested. After his release, Clarke lived in Alsace until Lazare Carnot sent him to Italy to serve as Napoleon Bonaparte's chief topographical officer, until he was sent to Sardinia. After 18 Brumaire, Clarke served as Chief of the Topographical Bureau, State Councillor, state secretary for the army and navy.Dagu√©, Everett. Napoleon and the First Empire's Ministries of War and Military Administration: The Construction of a Military Bureaucracy. Lewiston, NY: E. Mellen, 2006. During the war against Austria in 1805, Clarke was appointed governor of Vienna and during the war against Prussia in 1806 he served as governor of Erfurt and of Berlin. Louis- Alexandre Berthier's position as both Chief of Staff and Minister of War proved overwhelming, and in 1807 Napoleon relocated the Ministry of War to Paris, naming Clarke to head it. Clarke quickly took control of the Ministry and began developing its authority, first by taking over the responsibilities of the Ministry of War Administration and then by encroaching upon other Ministries' administrative areas. His role in thwarting the British invasion of the Netherlands, the Walcheren Campaign in 1809, lead to the emperor creating him \\"Duke of Feltre\\" (extinguished in 1852 but extended in 1864). Napoleon came to depend on his authority and he was instrumental in organizing the administration and building the Grande Arm√©e in 1811-12. As chief military organizer, he claimed authority over conscription, the production of all military items, funding, and even health services. This led both to conflict with other Ministers and to an expansion of his own authority. In 1812, when Claude Fran√ßoise Malet attempted his coup in Paris, Clarke saw an opportunity to expand his authority yet further. Anne Jean Marie Ren√© Savary, the Minister of Police and Clarke's main rival by 1812, was arrested by Malet and Clarke moved in to provide military police powers. Napoleon, however, was alarmed by Clarke's assumption of power in his absence and upon his return to Paris in December 1812 reappointed Savary.Everett Dague (December 1992). \\"Henri Clarke, Minister of War, and the Malet Conspiracy\\". Napoleonic Scholarship: The Journal of the International Napoleonic Society. Although he needed Clarke's centralized Ministry in 1813, he never fully trusted Clarke after the Malet affair, and in November 1813 appointed an equally strong administrator, Pierre Daru, as Minister of War Administration. Daru began building his own authority, and during 1814 the army suffered as both Clarke and Daru sparred over administrative responsibilities and authority. As the Allies approached Paris, Clarke found himself with the responsibility to defend the capital but with split authority; not only was he charged with producing manpower for Napoleon, a duty he shared with Daru, but he was also responsible for the population and civil defense. He found himself organizing hospitals and mobilizing the population. In the end, his efforts at defense were ineffectual and he was one of the generals pressing for Napoleon's abdication. After Napoleon's abdication he was replaced as Minister of War by Dupont de l'√âtang but Louis XVIII of France made him a Peer of France. When Napoleon landed in Southern France in March 1815 to reclaim his throne (the \\"Hundred Days\\"), Clarke was again made Minister of War and served until the Bourbon government fled. When the King fled to Ghent, Clarke followed him. After Napoleon's second abdication, Clarke was made Minister of War once more and served in that capacity until 1817 when Gouvion Saint-Cyr took over. He was then given command of the 15th Military Division. In 1816 he was made a Marshal of France. Clarke died in 1818. ==References== ==External links== * McGarry, S., Irish Brigades Abroad (Dublin, 2013) * Spencer Napoleonica Collection at Newberry Library Category:1765 births Category:1818 deaths Category:French people of Irish descent Category:People from Landrecies Category:Dukes of the First French Empire Category:French commanders of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Marshals of France Category:French Republican military leaders of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:Knights of the Order of Saint Hubert Category:Peers of France Category:French Ministers of War Category:Names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe ","title":"Henri Jacques Guillaume Clarke"},{"id":"3256062","text":"Sherborne Hundred was a hundred in the county of Dorset, England, containing the following parishes: ==See also== *List of hundreds in Dorset ==Sources== *Boswell, Edward, 1833: The Civil Division of the County of Dorset (published on CD by Archive CD Books Ltd, 1992) *Hutchins, John, History of Dorset, vols 1-4 (3rd ed 1861‚Äì70; reprinted by EP Publishing, Wakefield, 1973) *Mills, A.

He fought in many of the most significant battles in the Western Theater of the war, and briefly took command of the Army of Tennessee in 1865. ==Early life and career== Stewart was born in Rogersville, Tennessee. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1842 (12th of 56 cadets) and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 3rd U.S. Artillery Regiment. He resigned his commission on May 31, 1845Eicher, p. 511. to become a professor of mathematics and experimental philosophy at Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee, and later attained the same position at the University of Nashville. ==Civil War service== At the start of the American Civil War in 1861, although he was a strong anti-secessionist Whig politically, Stewart accepted a commission as major in the artillery of the Tennessee Militia on May 17. Shortly afterwards he entered the Confederate Army on August 15 as a major of artillery. Stewart was appointed a brigadier general on November 8 and assigned to command the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, Columbus District, of the Confederate Department No. Two (the precursor to the Department of Tennessee), under Leonidas Polk. Stewart held this position from November 16 until that December, when his brigade was transferred to the Department's First Geographical Division, until February 1862. His brigade was returned to western Kentucky, briefly being added to John P. McCown's division, leading the defenses of the town at the Battle of New Madrid before McCown ordered it evacuated and withdrew down the Mississippi River. On April 1, Stewart's men joined Charles Clark's division, in Leonidas Polk's corps, of Albert Sidney Johnston's Army of Mississippi, just in time for the Battle of Shiloh. There, Stewart led his brigade in first-day attacks on the \\"Hornet's Nest\\" area in the center of the Union line. Following Johnston's death, command of the Army of Mississippi fell to P.G.T. Beauregard for the Siege of Corinth, where Stewart was present. President Davis soon replaced Beauregard in favor of Braxton Bragg, who transported the army to Chattanooga, Tennessee, in preparation for his invasion of Kentucky. In the Confederate Heartland Offensive, Stewart's brigade fought at the Battle of Perryville in Benjamin Cheatham's division of the army's right wing, commanded by Polk. The Army of Mississippi became the Army of Tennessee near the end of 1862, and Stewart and his brigade served continued to serve in Cheatham's Division in Polk's First Corps at the Battle of Stones River. Stewart was promoted to divisional command and to major general on June 2, 1863, assigned to William J. Hardee's corps for the Tullahoma Campaign. His division unsuccessfully opposed General George Henry Thomas's corps at the Battle of Hoover's Gap before his division was assigned to Simon Bolivar Buckner's corps and fought at the Battle of Chickamauga, Stewart being wounded in the fight on September 19. Prior to the second day, Buckner's corps was assigned to the army's left wing to be commanded by the recently arriving James Longstreet. Following Chickamauga, Buckner was demoted by Bragg and left for Virginia on medical leave; Longstreet left soon after to besiege Union- controlled Knoxville. Stewart's division remained at Chattanooga, and was assigned to John C. Breckinridge's corps, for whom he and his men fought on the extreme left of the Confederate line at the Battle of Missionary Ridge in November 1863. Stewart fought at the battles of Rocky Face Ridge, Resaca, and New Hope Church, commanding a division in John Bell Hood's corps of Joseph E. Johnston's Army of Tennessee early in the Atlanta Campaign in 1864. Stewart was then assigned command of the Third Corps, replacing William Loring who had assumed temporary command in June for the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain after Polk was killed by artillery on Pine Mountain just two weeks prior. He was appointed temporary Lieutenant General on June 23, 1864. Stewart next took part in the Battle of Peachtree Creek, taking possession of the home of Georgia's Quartermaster General, Ira Roe Foster, as his headquarters. Georgia Historical Commission marker 060-90, erected at that location, states: \\"Site of the Ira R. Foster house which was occupied as headquarters by Gen. A. P. Stewart, [CSA] during military operations N. of Atlanta, July 16‚Äì21, 1864. From here were issued the orders directing his troops in the Battle of Peachtree Creek, July 20.\\" Stewart led the Third Corps at the Battle of Ezra Church, where he was wounded in the forehead on July 28. Stewart continued to lead the Third Corps during the Franklin-Nashville Campaign in the fall of 1864, participating in the Battle of Franklin that November and the Battle of Nashville in December. Stewart's corps fared badly on the first day of the Battle of Nashville, and it broke on the second day when the troops to its left were forced from their position. What was left of the Army of Tennessee was sent east and fought in the Carolinas Campaign in 1865, once again under the command of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, who placed the Army of Tennessee (by this time fewer than 5,000 men) under Stewart's command. The Army was surrendered on April 26, and Stewart was paroled at Greensboro, North Carolina on May 1. ==Postbellum career== After the war, Stewart moved to Missouri in 1869 and became an insurance executive. He then moved to Mississippi in 1874, where he served as the Chancellor of the University of Mississippi until 1886. From 1890 to 1908, he was the commissioner of the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park. He was injured when he was hit by a train on March 30, 1893, and he returned to Missouri in 1906. By 1905, Stewart was described as \\"of advanced years, but clear of intellect\\" and \\"deeply interested...for several years\\" in the teachings of the Watch Tower; that magazine reported Stewart's baptism following a talk by Charles Taze Russell.\\"The Editor's Western Tour: St. Louis our Next Stop\\", Watch Tower, October 1, 1905, page 293, Reprints 3637, \\"We [that is, Charles Taze Russell and companions] had a warm welcome at St. Louis, too, and the attendance was excellent, notwithstanding the fact that we did not get the announcement into the WATCH TOWER, and hence but few came from nearby towns. The morning session was in the \\"Christian Church\\" edifice. The topic was \\"Consecration,\\" and following it nine symbolized full consecration by water baptism. Among the number was Brother Alexander Stewart, well known throughout the South for the active and prominent part he took in the war of the Rebellion, as the leader of \\"Stewart's Cavalry.\\" General Stewart is of advanced years, but clear of intellect. He has been a \\"soldier of the Cross\\" for some time, and deeply interested in \\"Present Truth\\" for several years. He expected to be symbolically baptized at the time of the Chattanooga Convention, but was prevented by ill health. After leaving the water Brother Stewart was heard to express great satisfaction at having thus outwardly confessed his blessed Lord and his full devotion to Him and His cause. Brother Stewart already had joined the army of the Lord, but by this act of public confession he, so to speak, donned his regimentals and joined the forces \\"on the firing line.\\" Russell delivered the funeral sermon in St. Louis\\"Brother A. P. Stewart's Funeral\\", Watch Tower, September 15, 1908, page 283, Reprints 4244, \\"Brother [Charles Taze] Russell, in closing this address, informed the audience that he was called to St. Louis, Mo., to preach the funeral sermon of our beloved brother, Gen. A. P. Stewart, once of the Confederate army, and ranking Lieutenant- General in the same. The funeral address on that occasion, we believe, was published by several of the prominent newspapers. Brother Russell returned to the convention after an absence of two days.\\" following Stewart's death in Biloxi, Mississippi in 1908.

Its historic buildings, built in 1916 at 1415 Grandin Road, were added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 10, 1985.http://nrhp.focus.nps.gov/natregadvancedsearch.do?searchType=natregadvanced&selectedCollections;=NPS%20Digital%20Library&referenceNumber;=85003115&natregadvancedsearch;=Search ==History== Peters Cartridge advertisement Joseph Warren King purchased the Austin & Carleton powder mill on the Little Miami River in 1855 and expanded it as the Miami Powder Company including the company town of Goes Station, Ohio. King sold the Miami Powder Company in 1877 to build the Great Western Powder Works with the company town of Kings Mills at a more favorable hydropower location downstream of Goes Station. A wooden dam diverted water into a power canal through the gorge in a narrow valley between steep adjacent hills. Manufacturing facilities were dispersed along the power canal to minimize damage during infrequent explosions. King's son-in-law Gershom Moore Peters began working at the powder mill in 1881 and became president of the powder company when King died in 1885. Peters formed the Peters Cartridge Company at Kings Mills in 1887. Machinery was manufacturing four-thousand cartridges per hour by 1889. A collision of loaded railway cars being shunted at the powder works on 15 July 1890 triggered an explosion killing twelve people and starting fires destroying the railroad station, the freight house, two Peters Cartridge Company office buildings, the shell factory, the cartridge loading plant, a large warehouse and six employee residences. Wood- frame structures were rebuilt on the opposite side of the river from the old powder works included a large shot tower completed in 1895. The last wood- frame structures were machine shop building R-3 and shotgun shell loading building R-21 built in 1907. With the approach of World War I the company received large ammunition orders from the Russian Empire and from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Bullet manufacturing building R-6 was built of brick; and money from wartime contracts was used to replace most of the old wooden framed buildings with brick and reinforced concrete structures including the main R-1 building in 1916, the R-17 power house in 1917, metallic cartridge loading building R-2 in 1918, primer assembly building R-9, and the R-23 indoor shooting range and ballistics laboratory in 1919. A taller brick shot tower painted with a large P became a local landmark. Remington Arms purchased the Peters Cartridge Company in 1934. Facilities were expanded during World War II to include the federally owned Kings Mills Ordnance Plant manufacturing military ammunition on an adjacent hill south of the Peters factory complex. Production of military ammunition ended in March 1944, and Remington sold the Kings Mills factory to Columbia Records. Columbia manufactured 78 rpm phonograph records at Kings Mills until 1949. When 45 rpm records became more popular the buildings were subsequently leased to Seagram distillers as warehouse space until 1968. Building R-1 and the brick shot tower survived into the 21st century. The site was listed as a Superfund National Priorities List site by the Environmental Protection Agency in April 2012 for copper, lead and mercury soil contamination.EPA's Superfund Site Information for PETERS CARTRIDGE FACTORY, Environmental Protection Agency == Location == === Little Miami River === Peter's Cartridge Company was built on the banks of the Little Miami River, because of the large amount of willow trees. These trees were burned to charcoal and used in the process of making gunpowder. There were a few powder factories in the river valley, but Peter's Cartridge Factory was the biggest. The small town near the factory was built for the workers, giving them places to sleep and places to shop. == Issues == === Explosions === Explosions happened multiple times in the factory's lifetime. One writer stated, \\"Later they became of such frequency as to cause little comment, unless they were especially violent.\\"  Notable Explosion  In 1942, an explosion of unknown origins shattered windows 30 miles away. == Later Businesses == Peters Cartridge Company has gone through multiple owners who tried to run businesses with the old building. In 1934, Remington Arms Company purchased the land from Peters Cartridge Company. == Redevelopment == In 2019, the Warren County Port Authority and the Environmental Protection Agency deemed the location safe and ready for development.
