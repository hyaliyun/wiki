Bartolomé Revilla was the very first Representative of the 2nd district of the newly created province of Rizal in the Philippines (under US administration) during the 1st Philippine Legislature of 1907. Born in an uncle's house in San Miguel, Bulacan (north of Manila) in August 24, 1867, Bartolomé spent most of his life in the Santa Cruz district of Manila where he died in 1922. One of 6 children born to Don Ceferino Revilla and Rosenda San Jose, Bartolome as a young boy learned to read and write under the tutelage of another uncle, Teodoro Revilla Jr, who was a Canonigo de Gracia (priest) of the Manila Cathedral. The young Bartolomé went to Colegio de San Juan de Letran for his secondary education and then proceeded to the University of Santo Tomas where he completed his Law degree in 1894. The book, Album Historico de la Primera Asamblea Filipina of 1907 (Worcester Philippine Collection, Library of the University of Michigan and compiled by Anthony R. Tuohy) also listed Bartolomé as being a Lieutenant in the legal corps of the Philippine Revolution against Spain. In 1901, the US colonial administration in the Philippines reorganized the Judiciary system and appointed highly select lawyers to form the judicial base of America's prime colony and Bartolomé Revilla was appointed as the Secretary of The Department of Public Prosecution. It was also in this period that Bartolome Revilla found time to be a Professor of Law, heeding the call of fellow \\"Ilustrado\\", Felipe Calderon—after Don Felipe established the Escuela De Derecho which targeted the development of more skilled lawyers in the country. From then on to 1906, he would serve several provinces in the Philippines—this time in the official capacity as fiscal and judge of the court of first instance (from the Report of the Philippine Commission to the US Secretary of War 1901). A career judge, he worked closely with former Philippine Commonwealth president Manuel Quezon in the province of Tayabas, where Bartolome was Court of First Instance judge and Quezon was its governor. It is presumed that Manuel Quezon had invited Bartolome Revilla to leave the judiciary and run for the legislative branch. Both men were previously members of the Philippine Revolutionary Army under Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo and later on were party mates in the Partido Nacional Progresista, prior to the 1907 elections for the Philippine Assembly. Bartolome Revilla resigned his official position in the judiciary to enter the 1907 elections where he won as the Representative of Rizal's 2nd district. Thus he was elected as one of two first ever Representatives of the province's history. The 1st District was duly won by Cayetano Lukban. Rizal Province's 2nd District then included the following Municipalities: Antipolo, Binangonan, Cainta, Jalajala, Marikina (Mariquina), Morong, Pasig, Pililla, San Mateo, Tanay, Taytay, Montalban (re- established 1908), Cardona (re-established 1914), Teresa (re-established 1918), Baras (re-established 1920), Angono (re-established 1938), Quezon City (established 1939). As a Representative of the 1907-1909 Assembly, he was a member of the following committees: Appropriation, Civil Service, Elections and Revision of Laws. Finishing his term as Representative in 1909, he chose not to run for re-election and instead went back to being an active member of the judiciary. Bartolome Revilla was married to Doña Vitaliana Revilla of Pasig City and had eight children. He was also the brother of pioneer Philippine educator, Susana Revilla (co-founder of Instituto de Mujeres in Manila). ==Bibliography== *Cullinane, Michael (1989).

In the Providence bunker, the agents are watching footage that demonstrates that May has left the team, and that Grant Ward and Skye left together, hand-in-hand, on the Bus. Agent Eric Koenig is nowhere to be found. Confused by the events, the team disperses to make dinner, when Leo Fitz discovers a hidden message from Skye that says \\"Ward is Hydra.\\" At the same time, Jemma Simmons finds Koenig's body. Realizing that Skye has uncovered Ward's duplicity, the team, after overcoming their shock, decide to pursue Ward to rescue Skye. As they prepare to leave, US Special forces led by Colonel Glenn Talbot swarm the Providence bunker - Agent Hill has led them to Coulson's location. Talbot threatens prison for Coulson's team, but Coulson informs Hill of Ward's betrayal. She and Coulson incapacitate the Special Forces, and the team heads out to intercept Skye and Ward. Skye, in the meantime, has led Ward to the diner where she first met Mike Peterson and is delaying the decryption of her hard drive. While stalling, she alerts the Police to their whereabouts, and the police attempt to apprehend the two S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Ward overpowers them, but Skye attempts to flee in a Police vehicle. However, she is stopped by Deathlok, who takes her back to the Bus. She refuses to help Ward and Deathlok decrypt the hard drive, and expresses her hatred of Ward, despite his insistence that his feelings for her are real. Deathlok uses one of his weapons to induce a heart attack by \\"stopping\\" Ward's heart, and Skye gives in to save him, agreeing to decrypt the drive. She reveals that the harddrive encryption is tied to altitude, stating that they must be at 35,000ft for the drive to unlock. While preparing to take off, Ward is confronted by Hill in John Garrett's old aircraft, who threatens him, but Ward calls her bluff stating that Coulson would never risk Skye, and takes off anyway. However, Hill's delay allowed Coulson time to sneak on board via the wheel well. Coulson finds Skye and plans to take down Ward, but he doesn't know about Deathlok’s presence. That necessitates a new plan; running away. Skye and Coulson retreat to Lola and, under fire from Ward and Deathlok, drop out of the sky and plummet towards LA. Lola’s thrusters kick in at the last second and they fly to the ground. Deathlok then attempts to convince Ward to let them go now that the drive is decrypting on Garrett's orders, but Ward refuses. The team retires to a hotel, where Skye reveals she left a trap in the hard drive. Later, May returns and shows Coulson the contents of a flash drive she recovered from his \\"grave,\\" specifically a message to Fury from the director of T.A.H.I.T.I. The file is a video of Coulson himself informing Fury that T.A.H.I.T.I. must be shut down because of horrific side effects the drugs had on test subjects, which could only be mitigated by erasing the victim's memory of what happened. ==ProductionDevelopment=== In April 2014, Marvel revealed that the twentieth episode would be titled \\"Nothing Personal\\", and would be written by Paul Zbyszewski and DJ Doyle, with Billy Gierhart directing. ===Casting=== In April 2014, Marvel revealed that main cast members Clark Gregg, Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge would star as Phil Coulson, Melinda May, Grant Ward, Skye, Leo Fitz, and Jemma Simmons, respectively. It was also revealed that the guest cast for the episode would include J. August Richards as Mike/Deathlok, Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill, Adrian Pasdar as Colonel Glenn Talbot, B.J. Britt as Agent Antoine Triplett and Josh Breeding as parking attendant. Breeding did not receive guest star credit in the episode. Richards, Smulders, Pasdar, and Britt reprise their roles from earlier in the series. ===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins=== The episode features the first mention of Man-Thing in the MCU, though his comic wife Ellen Brandt appeared in Iron Man 3 portrayed by Stéphanie Szostak. The mention comes from Hill, who Smulders previously portrayed in The Avengers and Captain America: The Winter Soldier, as she has a phone conversation with Pepper Potts, who is portrayed in the films by Gwyneth Paltrow. ==ReleaseBroadcast=== \\"Nothing Personal\\" was first aired in the United States on ABC on April 29, 2014. ===Marketing=== For the final six episodes, Marvel began the \\"Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: The Art of Level Seven\\" initiative, in which a different image was released each Thursday before a new episode, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode. Bell stated that the initiative was a way to tie the series back to its comics roots, and was thought of at the beginning of the season. The production team tried to pair specific artists to the teaser posters based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode. The poster for \\"Nothing Personal\\", created by Stephanie Hans, highlights Skye and Ward in a depiction of a moment from the episode, with Deathlok looming over them, and the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo in the background. ===Home media=== The episode, along with the rest of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.s first season, was released on Blu-ray and DVD on September 9, 2014. Bonus features include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel. On November 20, 2014, the episode became available for streaming on Netflix. ==ReceptionRatings=== In the United States the episode received a 2.1/6 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 2.1 percent of all households, and 6 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was watched by 5.95 million viewers. ==ReferencesExternal links== *\\"Nothing Personal\\" at ABC * * Category:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

It was centered on Isesaki jin'ya in what is now part of the city of Isesaki, Gunma. Isesaki was ruled through most of its history by a junior branch of the Sakai clan. ==History== Isesaki Domain was originally created in 1601 for Inagaki Nagashige, a hatamoto formerly in the service of the Imagawa clan who had transferred his allegiance to Tokugawa Ieyasu. After Tokugawa Ieyasu took control over the Kantō region in 1590, he assigned estates with revenues of 3000 koku to Inagaki Nagashige in Kōzuke Province, and entrusted him with the defense of Ogo Castle. He was awarded additional estates in 1601, following Ieyasu’s defeat at the hands of Uesugi Kagekatsu at Aizu, which elevated him to the rank of daimyō. His son was transferred in 1616, and Isesaki was thereafter ruled by three junior branches of the Sakai clan until the end of the Edo period. During the Bakumatsu period, forces of Iseskai Domain played a role in the suppression of the Tengutō Rebellion; however the next-to-last daimyo, Sakai Tadatsuyo was quick to join the imperial side in the Boshin War. After the end of the conflict, with the abolition of the han system in July 1871, Isesaki Domain became \\"Isesaki Prefecture\\", which later became part of Gunma Prefecture. The domain had a population of 1964 samurai in 520 households per a census in 1763.Edo daimyo.net ==Holdings at the end of the Edo period== Unlike most domains in the han system, which consisted of several discontinuous territories calculated to provide the assigned kokudaka, based on periodic cadastral surveys and projected agricultural yields,Mass, Jeffrey P. and William B.

He was raised in Barbados, in the United States, including San Juan, Puerto Rico, and the United Kingdom. He is the grandson of Wayne Morse, who served as a United States Senator from Oregon from 1944 to 1969, and the nephew of Francisco Reus-Froylán, who was the first native-born Puerto Rican Episcopal Bishop of Puerto Rico from 1964 to 1989. In addition to his English vernacular, Eaton has a working knowledge of Spanish and French, as well as other classical and ancient languages. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1982 in the Classics from King's College London, and was elected an Associate of King's College (AKC). In 1985 he obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Theology from Queens' College, Cambridge. ==Career== Eaton was trained for the priesthood and obtained a Certificate in Theology at Westcott House, Cambridge, and was ordained deacon on June 29, 1986 by his uncle, Reus-Froylán, at St John's Episcopal Cathedral, San Juan. On June 29, 1987 he was ordained priest at Canterbury Cathedral by Robert Runcie, Archbishop of Canterbury. After a curacy at All Saints, Maidstone, Kent, he served as Fellow's Chaplain at Magdalen College, Oxford, from 1989 to 1991, where he also did graduate research in Early Christian history and literature. Before being elected on the fourth ballot among 6 candidates and being consecrated as Bishop Coadjutor, he served as Associate Rector of St Paul's Episcopal Church in Salt Lake City, Utah from 1991 to 1995, and Honorary Canon Theologian to the Bishop of Utah from 1991 to 2001.

Eaton's consecration was held on May 9, 2015, the Feast of St. Gregory the Theologian, at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, Miami, Florida. The Chief Consecrator was Katharine Jefferts Schori, Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, and the principal co-consecrators were Leopold Frade, the outgoing bishop of the diocese, and Robert J. O'Neill, Bishop of Colorado.

Schaefer of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and Bishop Graham H. Rights of the Moravian Church in North America. This was an historic liturgy, being the first time that bishops of these four churches have joined Episcopal bishops in the ordination of an Episcopal bishop. This ordination also united the ancient historic successions of the Old Catholic Church, the Mar Thoma Syrian Church and the Anglican Communion. Bishops from the Church of England, Spain, the Province of the West Indies, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico (both Provisional Bishop Wilfrido Ramos-Orench as well as retired Bishop David A. Alvarez-Velázquez), jurisdictions with large populations in Southeast Florida, were present and served as co-consecrators. Eaton succeeded Frade as IV Diocesan Bishop on January 9, 2016.

Bishops from throughout The Episcopal Church, The Anglican Communion and churches in communion with Anglicans attended; some coming from as far as Africa. Bishop Eaton invited all the priests of the diocese to concelebrate The Eucharist. Eaton was escorted in and out of the service by the youth from throughout the diocese. The service ended with a Blessing of the City and a full peal of the change ringing bells; which took three hours to complete. Both Tomas Pedro Regalado and Congresswoman Frederica Wilson greeted Eaton. Regalado presented a proclamation declaring January 30 \\"Peter David Eaton Day\\" in Miami. During his tenure as Bishop Coadjutor, he bagan to familiarize himself with his upcoming duties as Diocesan Bishop, including meetings with members of Florida's Congressional delegation in Washington.http://diosefnews.blogspot.com/2015/11/bishop-coadjutor-meets- florida.html As has been customary for over half a century, Bishop Eaton's diocese gave the current Presiding Bishop, Michael Curry, a Primatial Cross which Eaton had designed and crafted in the town of Bethlehem in the Holy Land.https://www.episcopalnewsservice.org/2019/06/19/presiding-bishop- receives-new-primatial-cross-from-southeast-florida-bishop/ ==See also== * List of Episcopal bishops of the United States * Historical list of the Episcopal bishops of the United States ==References== Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of King's College London Category:Associates of King's College Category:Bishops of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America Category:Religious leaders from Washington, D.C.

(Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division), revolving around the character of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they hunt for the mysterious Clairvoyant. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The episode was written by Paul Zbyszewski, and directed by Bobby Roth. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge. The episode brings together several major guest stars from throughout the season, including J. August Richards, Titus Welliver, Saffron Burrows, Maximiliano Hernández, and Bill Paxton, with Hernández's appearance leading into the beginning of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, a film that the rest of the episode mentions and partly runs concurrently with. \\"End of the Beginning\\" originally aired on ABC on April 1, 2014, and according to Nielsen Media Research, was watched by 5.71 million viewers. ==Plot== In a safe house, S.H.I.E.L.D. agents John Garrett and Antoine Triplett are attacked by Mike Peterson, who had become the cyborg \\"Deathlok\\" and is working for their nemesis, the Clairvoyant. Weeks later, Phil Coulson recruits Agents Garrett, Triplett, Victoria Hand, Felix Blake and Jasper Sitwell to join his team to hunt down the Clairvoyant and Deathlok. Garrett and Coulson believe that the Clairvoyant is a psychic, and that Deathlok's recent attack signifies that they are getting close to unraveling the true identity of the Clairvoyant. The two have narrowed their list to those were rejected by S.H.I.E.L.D. as gifted people. Garrett believes that they should compartmentalize the information to withhold this from the Clairvoyant. Coulson assigns Skye to choose which candidates to pursue and to pair the agents into teams; he promotes her into a full-fledged S.H.I.E.L.D. agent to help her gain access to the information. Before they could begin, Sitwell leaves the team after he is ordered by the Triskelion to report to the S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel Lemurian Star, and Hand decides to assist them via satellite from the Hub. Garrett tells Skye that the team has changed the perspective of Agent Grant Ward, who now has a cause to fight for. Agent Melinda May offers to help fellow agents Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons in their research of the drug that helped heal the injuries of Coulson and Skye. Triplett, who is partnered with Ward, is revealed to harbor a grudge against the Clairvoyant for killing his partner. Coulson, Garrett, May and Blake are assigned to other locations, however Blake is ambushed by Deathlok. Deathlok declares that \\"Mike Peterson is dead\\" before critically injuring Blake, who manages to plant a tracker on him. The team concludes that the target May and Blake were following, Thomas Nash, is their prime suspect. Through the tracker planted by Blake, the agents pursue Deathlok in an abandoned horse racing track, while Triplett and Simmons stay behind at the Hub with Hand. After a brief battle with Deathlok, Coulson and Garrett discover Nash, who is in a vegetative state, but seems to communicate through a speech-generating device. Nash, boasting that he is the Clairvoyant, claims he can see everything, and threatens to kill Skye, causing an enraged Ward to shoot him dead. Before they depart to interrogate Ward, May informs Coulson that Director Nick Fury needs Coulson at the Triskelion. Meanwhile, on the Bus, Fitz discovers May's secret phone line while attempting to create another line to contact Simmons. When Skye presents the results of her analysis of the S.H.I.E.L.D. psychological files to Coulson, the two realize that the Clairvoyant was not Nash, but a member of S.H.I.E.L.D. with similar access to the files allowing them to manipulate the agents by apparently having privileged information. While Coulson accuses a defensive Ward of shooting Nash to misdirect them on the Clairvoyant's true identity, Fitz informs Skye of the secret phone line. Coulson is informed of May's secret line and, alongside Skye, confronts her. As May tries to explain that she could not disclose who is on the other end of the line, the plane is remotely hijacked. At the Hub, Hand is revealed to be the one that commissioned the hijack and orders her subordinates to kill the agents except for Coulson, saying, \\"He's mine\\". ==ProductionDevelopment=== In March 2014, Marvel revealed that the sixteenth episode would be titled \\"End of the Beginning\\", and would be written by Paul Zbyszewski, with Bobby Roth directing. ===Casting=== In March 2014, Marvel revealed that main cast members Clark Gregg, Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge would star as Phil Coulson, Melinda May, Grant Ward, Skye, Leo Fitz, and Jemma Simmons, respectively.

As a man with a great influence, he managed to secure privileges for the area that suffered under Ottoman misrule. Furthermore he was a member of the Filiki Eteria,Spyridon Trikoupis [Σπυρίδων Τρικούπης], Ιστορία της Ελληνικής Επαναστάσεως, 1860, vol.1, p.177. a secret 19th-century organization whose purpose was to overthrow the Ottoman rule of Greece and establish an independent Greek state. With the outbreak of the revolution, he managed to get permission to recruit men by tricking the Ottoman authorities pretending being loyal to them.Ioannis Philimon [Ιωάννης Φιλήμων], Δοκίμιον ιστορικόν περί της Eλληνικής Eπαναστάσεως, 1860, vol.3 (Γ'), p.128-129.Municipality of Aspropyrgos [Δήμος Ασπροπύργου], Symposium proceedings: B' Συμπόσιο Ιστορίας- Λαογραφίας Βόρειας – Δυτικής Αττικής – Πρακτικά, Ασπρόπυργος 1992, p.24. On 18 April 1821 in Kalamos in Attica he fought the Ottoman troops coming from Euboea. A few days later he led the attack against Athens. More specifically, in the night between the 25th and 26 April 600 gunmen attacked the walls from the side between Agioi Apostoloi and the Boubounistra Gate and quickly managed to capture the entire city except Acropolis.Spyridon Trikoupis, 1860, vol.1 (Α’), p.179.Ioannis Philimon, 1860, vol.3 (Γ'), p.131. During the summer of the same year, a serious dispute broke out between Vasileiou and the elders of Athens concerning the military leadership of Attica, after the arbitrary assumption of leadership by him on 14 June. The next day, Vasileiou became the target of an assassination attempt while, probably in retaliation, rebels looted the house of an Athenian notable.Municipality of Aspropyrgos, 1992, p.27. The situation appeared to smooth temporarily after the intervention of Demetrios YpsilantisIoannis Philimon, 1860, vol.3 (Γ'), p.373. and the dispatch of the Vasileiou and his men to Boeotia. However, later, he had a new conflict, this time with his compatriots, which according to one version, was triggered by the Athenian notables.Municipality of Aspropyrgos, 1992, p.28-31. From 1822 until 1825 Vasileiou was gradually promoted to the grades of deputy chiliarch, chiliarch and eventually taxiarch. He took part in the battles of Schimatari, the Siege of the Acropolis and of Marathon, but also in the campaign of Odysseas Androutsos in eastern Central Greece. Later, Vasileiou was appointed by Yannis Gouras in charge of levying the tithe in Attica, thus rekindling local rivalries of previous years.Municipality of Aspropyrgos, 1992, p.31-35. In May 1826 Meletis Vasileiou was murdered by his compatriots, who in the raid of Omer Pasha of Karystos in Attica rushed to declare their surrender to him, due to a disagreement with the commandant of the Acropolis, Yannis Gouras.Spyridon Trikoupis, 1862, vol.4 (Δ’), p.57. ==References== Category:1778 births Category:1826 deaths Category:Greek military leaders of the Greek War of Independence Category:Members of the Filiki Eteria Category:Assassinated Greek people Category:People murdered in Greece Category:People from Fyli ","title":"Meletis Vasileiou"},{"id":"46795616","text":"\\"Providence\\" is the eighteenth episode of the first season of the American television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D.

Garrett reveals that the Slingshot program, in which weapons are fired into space to keep them out of the wrong hands, is a deception, and all the weaponry is instead stored in a secret vault; they retrieve the Tesseract weapon found in Peru, the gravitonium generator and the Berserker staff, and also release numerous prisoners, including Ian Quinn. Meanwhile, Coulson's team (including Triplett) abandon the Hub when the military is dispatched to capture the remaining S.H.I.E.L.D. bases. Coulson's badge displays co-ordinates which he believes have been sent by Nick Fury, and he decides to follow the co-ordinates to the Canadian wilderness. The others are worried about his state of mind, with May concerned that Hydra may have used TAHITI to hijack Coulson's brain, if the agent overseeing the project was a sleeper agent. They search the wilderness and find a secret base, Providence, manned by communications specialist agent Eric Koenig, who initially tells the team that Fury is dead, but privately informs Coulson of his survival. Raina informs Ward and Garrett that Skye's encryption is too sophisticated and she cannot retrieve the data on the drive, so Garrett orders Ward to rejoin Coulson's team at Providence, and manipulate Skye into unlocking the drive. In an end tag, Garrett offers Quinn the gravitonium in exchange for continuing to assist Hydra. ==ProductionDevelopment=== In March 2014, Marvel revealed that the eighteenth episode would be titled \\"Providence\\", and would be written by Brent Fletcher, with Milan Cheylov directing. ===Casting=== In March 2014, Marvel revealed that main cast members Clark Gregg, Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge would star as Phil Coulson, Melinda May, Grant Ward, Skye, Leo Fitz, and Jemma Simmons, respectively.

(Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division), revolving around the character of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they face an escaped convict with enhanced abilities. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The episode was written by Monica Owusu-Breen, and directed by Vincent Misiano. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge. The episode introduces guest star Amy Acker as Audrey, who was first mentioned in The Avengers as \\"the cellist\\". \\"The Only Light in the Darkness\\" originally aired on ABC on April 22, 2014, and according to Nielsen Media Research, was watched by 6.04 million viewers. == Plot == After arriving at Providence, Ward tells Coulson's team that he failed to stop the Fridge raid, but claims that he killed Garrett. Koenig insists on interrogating everyone except Coulson, using a near-unbeatable lie detector. Everyone passes, including Ward, who is nearly caught out when asked why he is continuing to stay with his team, before admitting his feelings for Skye. Intending to recapture Fridge escapees, Coulson takes Ward's quinjet to Portland, along with Fitz, Simmons, and Triplett, to apprehend Marcus Daniels, who can absorb energy and attack others using Darkforce. Daniels ambushes Audrey Nathan, a woman he has been obsessed with for years, but she is rescued by Simmons and Triplett, while Coulson and Fitz attack Daniels with light, trying to feed him more energy than he can handle. However his powers have been increased as a result of experimentation by Hydra, and he overpowers them and escapes. Audrey is revealed to be the cellist Coulson previously had a relationship with, having fallen for him after he saved her from Daniels. Coulson decides not to reveal himself to her, because she is moving on with her life and he still has a duty to stop Hydra. Fitz suggests using Audrey to lure Daniels into a trap, and Coulson reluctantly agrees, as does Audrey. Rehearsing in a music hall, Audrey is again accosted by Daniels, before Fitz, Simmons and Triplett attack him with advanced pure light weapons, hoping they will be enough to kill Daniels. He overpowers them and approaches Audrey, but Coulson, obscured from Audrey's view, attacks Daniels with another light weapon, as does Triplett, causing Daniels to explode. The blast knocks Audrey unconscious, and Coulson tends to her, reassuring her that he is still alive, before she wakes up to find him gone. May leaves Providence after repairing the damaged Bus, knowing Coulson no longer wants her around. Skye convinces Koenig to help her hack the NSA so they can review the CCTV footage of the Fridge raid to try to trace the escapees. Ward murders Koenig to conceal his involvement in the raid, covering up the footage, and then spends time with Skye, confiding in her further about his childhood and admitting that he beat up his younger brother Thomas on the instructions of his older brother Christian, of whom he was terrified. Ward insists that he is not a good man and Skye tries to console him, leading to a kiss, but Skye finds blood behind Ward's ear and he leaves the room to clean it. Looking for Koenig, Skye discovers his body and realizes that Ward is a Hydra agent. She leaves a message to warn the others before rejoining Ward, pretending to still be unaware of his true nature. He tells her that Coulson has sent orders for them to take the Bus to Portland and meet them. Coulson, Fitz, Simmons and Triplett later return to Providence and are confused to find no sign of May, Ward, Skye, Koenig, or the Bus. In an end tag, May is picked up by her mother, a retired spy, who has located Maria Hill for her. == Production  Development === In March 2014, Marvel revealed that the nineteenth episode would be titled \\"The Only Light in the Darkness\\", and would be written by Monica Owusu-Breen, with Vincent Misiano directing. === Writing === Executive producer Jeffrey Bell, on the decision to introduce the character known previously in the MCU only as \\"the cellist\\" here, said, \\"there’s that one line and suddenly it’s who is this person? And what is this person? And when are we going to see this person? And we talked about it a number of times over the season, and we had different versions and different ideas how to get there....at a time when [Coulson]'s at his most vulnerable, it seemed to be a good choice for us.\\" Concerning the character of Blackout, Bell stated that \\"He’s the antagonist, in the same way we’ve used other Marvel characters as antagonists in the episodes. At the same time, we’re dealing with the fall-out of what happened with S.H.I.E.L.D., and the viewers finding out about Ward and what’s going on over there, so there’s a lot going on. Emotionally, he’s perfect. Here’s a character who absorbs light, and one of the things he says to Audrey – which is the title of the episode – he refers to her as “the only light in the darkness.” And his obsession with the cellist is a beautiful metaphor, I think, for who Coulson is to her, who she is to Coulson, who S.H.I.E.L.D. is to the world…and the idea of S.H.I.E.L.D. falling apart, and Hydra coming out and darkness speaking, the idea of having Blackout as an antagonist seemed perfect.\\" === Casting === In March 2014, Marvel revealed that main cast members Clark Gregg, Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge would star as Phil Coulson, Melinda May, Grant Ward, Skye, Leo Fitz, and Jemma Simmons, respectively. It was also revealed that the guest cast for the episode would include Bill Paxton as Agent John Garrett, Patrick Brennan as Marcus Daniels, Amy Acker as Audrey, B.J. Britt as Agent Antoine Triplett, and Patton Oswalt as Agent Koenig. Tsai Chin also guest stars as Lian May. Paxton, Brennan, Britt, and Oswalt reprise their roles from earlier in the series. === Music === With the introduction of Acker as Audrey, \\"the cellist\\", in this episode, composer Bear McCreary was able to bring back the Cellist Theme he composed for a brief moment in \\"The Magical Place\\" where the character was mentioned. For the sequence in the episode where the character plays cello, McCreary \\"wrote a collection of three short, repetitive musical figures set to various tempos\\" for Acker to learn and mimic with a cello coach, before performing the scene. Once the scene had been cut together, McCreary wrote a piece of music that \\"97%\\" matched Acker's visible movements, including timing and pitch. Eric Byers of the Calder Quartet performed the solo piece, working closely with McCreary to again mimic Acker's performance. A particularly tricky moment had the character suddenly stop playing on the arrival of Brennan's Daniels, with Byers trying \\"a dozen different versions\\" before he and McCreary were satisfied. McCreary stated that the biggest challenge \\"was to take all those constraints and compose a piece of music that satisfied them all and yet felt soaring and lyrical. After all that, I had to write orchestral score around the cello performance to help sell the tension, emotion, horror and triumph.\\" === Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins === The character of Audrey was first mentioned as \\"the cellist\\" in The Avengers as a love interest for Coulson. == Release  Broadcast === \\"The Only Light in the Darkness\\" was first aired in the United States on ABC on April 22, 2014. === Marketing === For the final six episodes, Marvel began the \\"Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: The Art of Level Seven\\" initiative, in which a different image was released each Thursday before a new episode, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode.

Although Dutilleux had been active as a composer for ten years when he wrote his piano sonata, he viewed it as his Opus 1, the first work that he considered up to his mature standards.Arkivmusic.com, Gary Higginson CD review Debussy, Ravel, Bartók and ProkofievMusicweb-international.com, Tony Haywood CD review have been cited as influences on the piece although critics have also stressed that its language is original and distinctive,Whitehouse, Richard, Henri Dutilleux - Complete Solo Piano Music, Naxos Records, liner notes. a personal synthesis of French Impressionism and Soviet music.Levin, Robert, Henri Dutilleux: D’ombre et de silence, ECM Records, liner notes. ==Movements== *Allegro con moto *Lied *Choral et variations ==Overview== The piano sonata represented an opportunity for Dutilleux to experiment with an ambitious, large-scale project, something that his previous commissioned works did not permit. In his own words: The piece combines two concerns typical of Dutilleux's mature works: formal rigour and harmonic research. Its themes are ambiguous, never completely modal nor tonal.The Solo Piano Works Of Henri Dutilleux: A Stylistics Analysis, Rosemarie Suniga, University of South Carolina, 2011. The opening Allegro con moto starts in but often changes meter. It is bithematic and classical in structure, with an ample first theme while the second one derives from the former. From the very first bars, it displays F-sharp Major-minor ambiguity. Tritones are also featured prominently, as well as extremes of register which give the piece a symphonic character. The Lied is the shortest movement. In ternary A-B-A form, it is also sparser and more pensive than the other two. Its basic tonality is D-flat major although some degree of modal-tonal ambiguity is again noticeable. It begins in with some meter changes later on. The last movement starts with an imposing Choral in that suggests a four-voice polyphony. It is characterized by carillon-like sonorities that are created by the overlapping of low and high sustained notes. It is followed by 4 variations (Vivace - Un poco più vivo - Calmo - Prestissimo). Variation II features an early example of \\"fan-shaped phrases\\", a device Dutilleux would use frequently in his later works. The movement concludes with a varied recapitulation of the Choral. The variations are thus structured in a mini- sonata form, creating a \\"sonata within a sonata\\". Throughout the movement, several passages have a toccata-like character. The work has been described as \\"a brilliant, multi-layered piece with echoes of Bartók and Prokofiev\\" as well as a \\"sonata that Debussy might have written... sensuous and classical\\". ==Selected discography== * 1995 - Marie-Josephe Jude (CD - Harmonia Mundi #911569) * 2000 - Claire-Marie Le Guay (CD - Accord #465772) * 2000 - Anne Queffélec (CD - Virgin #45222) * 2007 - John Chen (CD - Naxos #8557823) * 2010 - Robert Levin (CD - ECM #2105) * 2012 - John Ogdon, recorded in 1972 (CD - Warner Classics #4637) * 2013 - Geneviève Joy, recorded in 1988 (CD - Erato #42755) * 2015 - Kathryn Stott (CD - BIS #2148) * 2020 - Elodie Vignon (CD - Cypres #4658) ==References== Dutilleux Category:1948 compositions Category:Compositions by Henri Dutilleux ","title":"Piano Sonata (Dutilleux)"},{"id":"46795688","text":"The Man Who Had His Hair Cut Short () is a 1947 novel by the Flemish writer Johan Daisne.

In 1693, the estate was inherited by Brereton Bourchier who started the construction of the present house. His daughter, Martha, married Henry Perrot the member of parliament for Oxfordshire from 1721 to 1740, who completed the house during the 1720s. The architect is not known although several authors have speculated about who was responsible. It was owned for a period by the Perrot family, and in 1819 it was owned by James Musgrave. The house was redecorated around 1780 by Anthony Keck, with further work by John Nash, including the library and conservatory, around 1811. The landscaped garden was laid out in the 18th century and has mature hardwood trees. In 1794 the parkland was extended by diverting the road to Abingdon. ==Architecture== The Georgian three-storey house has a west front of nine bays with a central door with pediments. The east front has seven bays. The interior is decorated with extensive plastrework, particularly on the staircase and halls. The extensive grounds and parkland include several subsidiary buildings. The gatehouse built by John Nash around 1810 is now known as Pepper-pot Lodge, another lodge was added in the mid 19th century. Nash was also responsible for the orangery east of the house. It has a slate roof supported by ionic columns. The stable block and coach houses were added in the early 19th century. These are now used as six workshops for small businesses. The estate has its own pumping house which was constructed in the late 19th century, and a large 18th century barn. There is also an 18th century dovecote, and a range of cottages originally built for the workers but now rented out. The formal gardens, close to the house, are divided by hedges laid out in the 1960s. Further from the house are plantations primarily made of beech trees but with some specimen planting including Wellingtonia. Other trees planted in the park include silver birch, and mixed deciduous and coniferous species The east lawn provides a Patte d'oie which acts as a focal point of several drives through the grounds. The walled kitchen garden is long and wide. It includes a long glasshouse. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Country houses in Gloucestershire Category:Grade II* listed parks and gardens in Gloucestershire Category:Grade II listed buildings in Gloucestershire Category:Grade I listed buildings in Gloucestershire Category:Grade I listed houses Category:Scheduled Ancient Monuments in Gloucestershire ","title":"Barnsley Park"},{"id":"46795748","text":"Bibury Court Bibury Court is a Grade I listed Jacobean country house in Bibury, Gloucestershire, England.

It has been owned by the Clifford family since the 11th century. The main buildings are the 18th century Frampton Court and, on the opposite side of the village green, Manor Farm. The gardens at Frampton Court have a Gothic orangery and ornamental canal in the style of William Halfpenny. The two houses, barn and orangery are all Grade I listed buildings in their own right, while the Gatepiers and Gates are Grade II* listed. ==History== Manor Farm wool barn The main estate originated from a lease of land granted to William Clifford and his family in 1320. The Feudal barony of Clifford had previously had their seat at Clifford Castle in Herefordshire. A moat once surrounded the original estate, but was built over by John Clifford in 1651 when a new brick house was built. This was rebuilt in 1731 using Bath stone. The architect is not known but may have been John Strahan or Nathaniel Ireson. The gothic garden house and canal were added in the 1750s, when the dovecote may also have been built. In 1893, the property was put on the market following the death of Henry James Clifford, and described as having ten bedrooms, four dressing rooms, and stabling for up to twelve horses. The Clifford family resumed ownership of the premises in the early 20th century. Since the 1980s the grounds have been the location for the annual Frampton Country Fair. ==Architecture== Orangery and canal The estate is centred on the two principal houses set either side of the Green: Frampton Court, a Palladian house of the early 1730s often attributed to the Bristol architect, John Strahan, and Manor Farmhouse, of the mid-15th century with a contemporary wool barn that was restored by the Cliffords. The primary building, Frampton Court, is stone built with the symmetrical front of the building having a central pediment with four ionic pilasters. to each side are smaller wings each of which has a chimney stack with an arched opening containing bells. Frampton Court has Jacobean pannelled rooms with tiled fireplaces. It holds a collection of 18th century furniture and china. There are also a collection of Victorian watercolours known as the Frampton Flora. These representations of local wild flowers were painted by various members of the Clifford Family in the 19th century. To the northeast of the main house is Gothic garden house, which is also known as the orangery, which was built in the mid 18th century. It consists of three octagonal towers, the largest of which has a small cupola. They are joined by single bay which has the front door. In front of the building is an ornamental canal, which is long and wide. The canal may be the remains of the moat around the earlier house. The building was repaired in the 20th century when the effects of an earlier fire were uncovered. Within the grounds of Frampton Court close to the entrance from the green is an octagonal dovecote dating from the mid 18th century. There is also a granary and store at Manor Farm with a dovecote lantern on the roof. Manor Farm was built, on the site of an earlier house, in the 15th century and added to in subsequent centuries. It has a courtyard plan with the service wings forming a \\"U\\" shape around the courtyard. The timber framing of the building is visible from inside and outside. The interior contains several stone fireplaces, one of which may have been brought into the house from elsewhere. The attached barn may have originally been built as a wool store. The timber framed building was constructed in the 15th century. The seven bay barn has a flagstone floor and an arch braced roof. ==Gardens and parkland== The gardens and surrounding parkland are Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England. Earlier gardens were replaced around 1806 from which the walled garden and yew hedges survive. The earlier garden included a parterre and kitchen garden. The current park is approximately by and is mostly grass with trees. South east of the house are lakes which were developed from earlier gravel pits. Surrounding the grounds are stone walls with ornate symmetrical gates and gatepiers. ==References== Citations Sources * * ==External links== *Official site Category:Country houses in Gloucestershire Category:Grade I listed houses Category:Grade I listed buildings in Gloucestershire Category:Palladian architecture Category:1730s architecture Category:Houses completed in the 18th century Category:Parks and open spaces in Gloucestershire Category:Grade II* listed parks and gardens in Gloucestershire ","title":"Frampton Court"},{"id":"46795759","text":"The Tomb of Panehsy (also Panehesy, Panhesy) is a sepulchre in Amarna, Upper Egypt.

These tombs are general larger than the tombs referred to as the Southern tombs. Panehsy's tomb, like the one belonging to Meryre, is known for the depictions of the temple of the Aten. The Tomb of Panehsy Amarna North Tomb 6 contains scenes of himself and his familyGay Robins, Ann S. Fowler, Proportion and Style in Ancient Egyptian Art, University of Texas Press 1994, pp.130f. and others showing the royal family,Robert Hari, New Kingdom – Amarna Period: The Great Hymn to Aten, Brill 1985, p.24 but his remains have never been identified. The tomb had suffered damage form iconoclasts. The images of Akhenaten and Nefertiti had been disfigured, and most of the names had been removed.Aldred, Cyril, Akhenaten: King of Egypt ,Thames and Hudson, 1991 (paperback), In later times, his tomb was turned into a Coptic place of worship for a whileRobins & Fowler, p.60 and suffered damage. A deep font for total immersion was placed before the apse. ==Tomb decorationCeiling=== On one of the ceilings Panehesy mentions receiving gold from the king for doing a great thing for his lady, the king's daughter. ===Jambs outer door=== The upper panel shows the King with the crown of the North on the left and the crown of the south on the right. On the left Akhenaten is followed by Nefertiti wearing a Khat headdress. Both seem to be offering loaves (?). On the right Nefertiti wears her flat-topped blue crown. In these scenes only Meritaten seems to accompany her parents. Below these scenes we see Akhenaten wearing the Khepresh crown and Nefertiti wearing her blue crown again apparently offering food from the offering table. ===Lintel outer door=== Below that we have a double scene showing Akhenaten and Nefertiti with their three eldest daughters before an altar. On the left Akhenaten and Nefertiti are both shown burning incense. Nefertiti wears her flat topped blue crown while Akhenaten is shown wearing his khepresh crown. On the right hand side of the scene Akhenaten still wears the same crown, but Neefertiti is now shown wearing a close fitting cap. The king and queen are shown pouring something from a vase. The three princesses are shown shaking sistra. The presence of two dwarfs points to the presence of Nefertiti's sister Mutbenret (Mutnedjmet), who is probably depicted in the register above and to the side of the princesses. ===Thickness of outer wall=== Akhenaten and Nefertiti offering to the Aten. From the tomb of Panehsy in Amarna. from Lepsius Denkmahler. On the right hand side Akhenaten and Nefertiti raise Sekhem scepters, giving homage to the sun. They are accompanied by Meritaten, Meketaten and Ankhesenpaaten, shaking a sistrum. The king wears the Khepresh crown. Nefertiti's image is too heavily damaged to determine her headdress. The Queen's figure is accompanied by rather elaborate titulary: :The heiress, great of favor, mistress of the district of the South and the North, fair of face and gay with the two feathers, soothing the heart of the King at home (?), pleased at all that is said, the great and beloved wife of the King, Lady of the Two Lands (Nefertiti). On the right hand side we see the King burning spices in a hawk headed censing-spoon, while the queen presents a bouquet of lotus flowers. Both wear an elaborate Atef-crown. Akhenaten wears a triple Atef crown flanked by uraei and topped with falcons wearing a sundisk and accompanying a double cartouche. Nefertiti wears a double Atef-crown flanked by two uraei. This crown is worn on a uraeus shaped modius and on top of what looks like a khat headdress.Tyldesley, Joyce. Nefertiti: Egypt's Sun Queen. Penguin. 1998. In the register below this scene we see the Queen's sister Mutbenret (Mutnedjmet) accompanied by her two dwarves, two male attendants and four female attendants. ===South Wall, West Side: Panehesy rewarded=== Panehesy appears before the window of appearance. Meritaten appears in the window with Akhenaten and Nefertiti. Nefertiti is shown with her arm around her daughter. Meketaten and Ankhesenpaaten are shown embracing each other in the hall behind the window of appearance. Neferneferuaten Tasherit is shown clasping Ankhesenpaaten's arm. The princesses are accompanied by two nurses. ===South Wall, East Side: Royal family offering to the Aten=== Akhenaten and Nefertiti are shown offering flowers to the Aten. Akhenaten is depicted with the red crown of the North while Nefertiti seems to be wearing a short Nubian style wig (?). Meritaten, Meketaten, Ankhesenpaaten and Nefernefeuaten- tasherit are shown behind their parents. It is not clear what the older princesses are offering, but Ankhesenpaaten and Nefeneferuaten-tasherit are shown carrying bouquets of flowers just like their parents. ===East Wall: Royal Family driving out=== Akhenaten and Nefertiti are each shown driving their own chariot. Both seem to be wearing a blue crown. Nefertiti is shown with a whip held in her left hand. There are two chariots carrying two princesses each. Most likely Meritaten, Meketaten, Ankhesenpaaten and Nefernefeuaten-tasherit. There are also three chariots carrying six female attendants. ===West Wall: Royal Family at the temple=== Panehsy. Akhenaten and Nefertiti are shown side by side on a raised platform before an altar. Nefertiti is shown to the left of Akhenaten and is only indicated by an outline. They seem to be pouring something onto the altar. Meritaten is shown offering loaves, while Meketaten and Ankhesenpaaten shake a sitrum. The princesses are accompanied by two nurses and three attendants. ===North wall: The King and Queen Worshipping=== This scene was much damaged during the Coptic period. Akhenaten is shown holding up a plate with food offerings. Nefertiti stands behind him either holding up her hands or possibly offering up flowers or food which can no longer be seen. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt Category:Amarna tombs Category:Akhenaten ","title":"Tomb of Panehsy"},{"id":"46795787","text":"Krobo Girls' Senior High School is an all female second cycle institution in Odumasi Krobo in the Eastern Region of Ghana. ==History== The School was founded in March 1927 by Scottish Missionaries.

He fathered two children, Paola and Camilo Reyes, in Bolivia with Bolivian, Ruth Argandoña, who had worked with Camilo Torres Restrepo, the priest and member of the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla organization of Colombia, but after his release, he left them. Reyes Mata escaped through eastern Bolivia across the Andes into Arica, Chile. Working from Chile, he attempted to unite the revolutionaries from Bolivia and Chile under the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) banner and participated in unionizing factory workers. He also reactivated his medical license to be able to improve health care in Chile. In Chile, he formed his last partnership, with Blanca Teresa González Iturriaga, by whom he had four more children: Chemy, Mayte, José Maria and Teresa. When Salvador Allende was overthrown in the 1973 Chilean coup d'état, Reyes Mata and his family obtained political asylum at the Honduran Embassy, until they could make arrangements to return to Central America. In March, 1979, he attended the Second Congress of the Revolutionary Party of Central American Workers (PRTC) and in April 1979 Reyes Mata was chosen as secretary general. In April, 1980, Reyes Mata was arrested during the run-up to the elections that year for a wave of pre-election violence and the kidnapping of a Texaco executive. He was released by a general amnesty that same year and briefly moved to Nicaragua to initiate plans for a RUF unit inside Honduras with Sandinista support. He returned to Honduras and kidnapped Arnold Quiros, vice president of US Brands, a US banana exporting corporation. Beginning in 1981, he conducted a recruitment campaign in Honduras for the RUF unit and sent volunteers from Managua to Cuba for military training. He was arrested later that year and convicted of the 1980 kidnapping but was later freed under a 1982 amnesty agreement. About the same time as he was released from prison, his trainees returned to Nicaragua and were placed with Sandinista units to gain combat experience. In July, 1983, \\"Father Guadalupe\\" (James Francis Carney) resigned from the Jesuits and decided to accompany, as their chaplain, Reyes Mata's 96 Honduran guerrillas from Nicaragua back to Honduras. Reyas Mata, who was using the alias Comandante Pablo Mendoza was declaring war on the oligarchs in power in Honduras who were enmeshed with the US capitalists. The Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) wanted him to use Nicaragua as a base for incursions into Honduras, hoping they could later use the guerrillas as a bargaining chip with the Honduran government. Possibly Reyes Mata, suspected the double-cross, but he was unwilling to conduct the operation from Nicaragua, believing he had better support in the east. The last absolutely known whereabouts of the group was near the border between Nicaragua to Honduras, on 19 July 1983, as verified in Reyes Mata's diary, which was recovered and translated into English by the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS), later declassified by the CIA. They were in the Olancho Department in the Piedras Azules, mountainous area, when the guerrilla column was identified and besieged by Honduran military troops, possibly accompanied by US and Nicaraguan allied forces. Initial reports claimed that they were killed in a series of gun battles, in an operation of Honduran and US troops called \\"Patuca\\" led by General Gustavo Alvarez. But, soldiers reported that Reyes Mata had been taken alive and was held as a prisoner at the Air base at El Aguacate for interrogation. News reports in the US stated that Reyes Mata was killed on 18 September 1983 and the priest \\"Father Guadalupe\\" (James Francis Carney) died of exhaustion and starvation while trying to escape. A declassified report from the United States indicated that Reyes Mata, who was unarmed, was shot by a squadron commander of the Honduran military in the presence of officers and that the body has never been found. El Diario Barricada, the official Sandanistan newspaper, reported the death on 3 October 1983. In 2014, a report issued by the governmental National Human Rights Commissioner in Honduras reported the death occurred on 16 September 1983 and released photographs of the death taken on 20 September 1983. == References == Category:1943 births Category:1983 deaths Category:Honduran physicians Category:Honduran murder victims Category:20th-century physicians ","title":"José María Reyes Mata"},{"id":"46795877","text":"Barbara Thalheim (born Leipzig 5 September 1947) is a Berlin-based German popular singer and songwriter. She celebrated the fortieth anniversary of her first stage appearance in 2013. ==LifeFamily background and early years=== Barbara Thalheim was born in Leipzig. Her father was a cultural administrator. He had also been a Communist who in 1933 had emigrated first to Africa and later to France. However, he was handed over to the Gestapo, and by May 1945 when Germany's Nazi years ended in military defeat, he had survived three years as a detainee in the Dachau concentration camp. When her parents married her father was 40 years old and her mother was 22. Her early schooling was in Leipzig, but after she was about 12 she attended school in Berlin where her grandmother still lived: she was struck by the stark contrast between the dialects of her native Saxony and of Berlin. Dialect differences left her feeling out of place in both regions, as a result of which, she later stated that she had at that time \\"hated all her schools\\". When she was around 13 the entire family relocated to Berlin where she would later undertake her professional training and begin her career. Barbara Thalheim was trained as a singer at the Central Studio for Entertainment Art. This was followed by further training, initially by correspondence course and later, between 1973 and 1976 in composition, under Wolfram Heicking at Berlin's \\"Hanns Eisler\\" Music Academy. ===Artistic career in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany)=== Between 1970 and 1972 Thalheim sang in the \\"Berlin chanson group\\" (\\"Chansongruppe Berlin\\")The \\"chanson\\" genre in German refers to popular French style songs. The French word \\"Chanson\\", when used in German, generally does not carry the more scholarly and historical connotations that may apply when it is used in English language sources. During this time she released, through \\"Amiga\\", her first \\"single\\" (recording). Her next professional partner was a classical String quartet, with which she continued to work till 1980. Before that, however, from 1977 she was touring abroad, making regular guest appearances in West Germany, the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland and France. Despite the unusually wide range of foreign tours, she was also releasing further records in the German Democratic Republic (GDR). Her first two LPs – \\"Lebenslauf\\" (\\"Resumé\\") and \\"Was fang ich mit mir an\\" (\\"Where do I begin?\\") – appeared under license in West Germany. Until 1993 the lyrics for her songs were written by the writer-journalist Fritz-Jochen Kopka, with whom she lived for 25 years, and who was the father of her two daughters. She made stage appearances with many of the international musical stars of the day, including Georges Moustaki, Konstantin Wecker, Herman van Veen, Hanns Dieter Hüsch, Marek Grechuta, Hana Hegerová, and Georg Danzer. ===Politics=== Foreign travel was seen as a privilege conferred (or not) by state authorities in the countries ruled under Soviet direction at this time, and in 1980, following a change of policy by East Germany's ruling SED (party), Barbara Thalheim went public with criticism of a newly imposed travel ban on East German artists wishing to tour in western Europe. Although the text could not be published in East Germany, its publication in West Germany meant that interested parties in the east quickly became aware of it. She was immediately deprived of her party membership and served with her own personal travel and recording ban. Eventually, however, she was permitted to renew her recording career with \\"Amiga\\", albeit with a different support band, and she was again able to take part in concerts and talk-shows in West Germany. In November 1989 major political changes appeared on the horizon when the Berlin Wall was breached and it quickly became clear that the fraternal Soviet troops in East Germany had no orders to crush the rising tide of political protest in the German Democratic Republic. With a Berlin-based rerun of the Prague Spring now seeming less likely than many had previously thought, this opened the way for a series of events leading to the end of the one- party dictatorship and then, formally in October 1990, political reunification. In 1990 Thalheim undertook a tour with the rockband, Pankow. Later she produced, with Pankow, the memorably entitled album \\"Ende Der Märchen \\" (\\"End of the Fairy-tale\\"), produced during December 1991/January 1992, and published later in 1992.

Their last tour together took place in 2009. Since 2001 the lyrics to her songs have been produced in close collaboration with the Dresden poet, Michael Wüstefeld. In 1995, now in her 48th year, she announced that in future she no longer wanted to perform as a singer, and set off on a valedictory stage-tour. She then set up cultural management business organising, among other things, the summer festival \\"Schaustelle Berlin\\" for the city council. Then in 1999, following recovery from serious illness, she launched her \\"Retirement from retirement\\", and with a new collection of songs embarked on a series of further concert tours and theatre productions with Jean Pacalet and a backing band. Early in 2012 Thalheim received a part share in a scholarship awarded at the Künstlerhof Schreyahn by the Lower-Saxony Ministry of Culture. This resulted in more songs and more touring, including, in December 2012, a concert in Chile,Porträt. Festival Musik und Politik a country still periodically featured in German news reports as the retirement destination of East Germany's former \\"first lady\\", Margot Honecker and, more briefly, of her late husband. ==Stasi collaboration== On 20 September 1972 Barbara Thalheim signed a handwritten \\"Collaboration undertaking\\" with the Ministry for State Security (Stasi). She is listed as an informer in Stasi records between 1972 and 1979 under the code name \\"IM Elvira\\". Collaboration ended abruptly after her exclusion from The Party 1980, by which time the ministry had already launched one of their infamous career destruction (\\"Operativer Vorgang\\") operations against her. On 29 July 1996 Der Spiegel published a short report purportedly unmasking Thalheim as \\"IM Elvia\\". By this time she had already made public her activities as a Stasi informant in a television interview, but at the time of the Spiegel report the television interview in question had not yet been transmitted. In addition, in various subsequent interviews she insisted that back in 1993 she had already asked the journalist Karl-Heinz Baum of the Frankfurter Rundschau to investigate and report on her Stasi-related activities. The Frankfurter Rundschau complied with her request, but published their own story only after Spiegel had broken the story, which for several years now took on a life of its own in the German media. A protracted public dispute ensued concerning how and when the story of \\"IM Elvira\\" had become public: one journalist allegedly stated he had discovered Thalheim's Stasi past by researching the Stasi archives, whereas Thalheim insisted that she had told him about it herself, and that in any case many of the files in question identified her not as a provider of reports to the Stasi but as the subject of reports provided to them. ==References== Category:Schlager musicians Category:East German musicians Category:20th- century German singers Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:German singer-songwriters Category:People of the Stasi ","title":"Barbara Thalheim"},{"id":"46795887","text":"is a Japanese manufacturer of specialty chemicals, polymers and agrichemicals. ==Corporate affairs== Kureha Chemical Industries is a member of the Mizuho keiretsu. ==ProductsPolyglycolic acid=== One of the company's long term investments is in polyglycolic acid (PGA).

He was the sixth son of Robert Bertie, 3rd Earl of Lindsey, and the eldest son by Lindsey's third wife, Lady Elizabeth Pope. In 1698, he was made a freeman of Appleby-in-Westmorland. In the 1705 election, he contested the borough of New Woodstock, Oxfordshire on the interest of his half-first cousin Lord Abingdon, then Lord Lieutenant of Oxfordshire. Like the rest of his family, he was a Tory, and he voted against the Court candidate for the Speakership, John Smith, in 1705. At the 1705 election, the Duke of Marlborough, to whom the royal gift of Blenheim Palace had brought great influence in Woodstock, had arranged for the return of his trusted lieutenant, General William Cadogan, as the other member for the borough. By the 1708 election, Marlborough had replaced Abingdon as lord lieutenant of the county, and his influence was such that Bertie did not bother to contest the borough. Abingdon may have considered nominating him for Oxfordshire at the 1710 election, but ultimately chose Francis Clerke, whose nephew had married Bertie's first cousin Catherine. Under the Harley Ministry, Bertie attempted to obtain a captaincy in the foot guards, but was not successful. On 29 April 1714, he married Mary (d. 1725), daughter of Thomas Browne of Addlethorpe and widow of Nicholas Newcomen of Theddlethorpe. After her death, on 13 February 1726, he married Mary, daughter of Rev. Henry Marshall. Neither marriage produced children.

James was the eldest of the four sons of James II and Esclaramunda of Foix, King and Queen of Majorca. As such, he was heir apparent to the throne of the Kingdom of Majorca. The family was exceptionally devout even by the standards of the era: his grandfather James I stepped down to join the Cistercians, while both his brother Philip and sister Sancia were noted for their close ties to the Order of Saint Francis. James himself probably became acquainted with the Franciscans alongside another prince of the same age, Louis of Naples, while the latter was held hostage in Barcelona by King James II of Aragon, the Majorcan prince's first cousin. At one point, the King is known to have issued a \\"note prohibiting the friars from visiting the princes at night\\", indicating their close relationship with each other and with the Franciscans. Louis renounced his position as heir apparent to the throne of Naples and became Bishop of Toulouse in 1297 (and was eventually canonized), dying the same year, which probably left an impression on James. James was set to marry Catherine de Courtenay, the heiress of the defunct Latin Empire. The betrothal was celebrated in 1298 in the presence of the entire French royal court, including King Philip IV and Queen Joan I. Since the couple were too closely related, the condition for the marriage was dispensation from Pope Boniface VIII. It was never granted. Instead, James decided to remove himself from the line of succession in favour of his brother Sancho and take the habit. In 1299, in the words of his sister Sancia, James \\"renounced royal power for the love of Jesus Christ and became a son of Blessed Francis and entered his order\\".

Selected in 2013 for a 2020 launch, the spacecraft will operate in the deep space radiation environment throughout its 6-to-12-month mission. This will help scientists understand the health threat from cosmic rays and deep space environment on living organisms and reduce the risk associated with long-term human exploration, as NASA plans to send humans farther into space than ever before. The mission is being developed by NASA Ames Research Center. ==Background== BioSentinel is one of thirteen low-cost CubeSat missions selected as secondary payloads for Artemis 1 (formerly known as Exploration Mission 1), the first test flight of NASA's Space Launch System. The spacecraft will be deployed in cis-lunar space. The BioSentinel mission will be NASA's first time since Apollo 17 in 1972, to send living organisms to deep space (beyond low Earth orbit). ==Objective== The primary objective of BioSentinel is to develop a biosensor using a simple model organism (yeast) to detect, measure, and correlate the impact of space radiation to living organisms over long durations beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) and into heliocentric orbit. While progress has been made with simulations, no terrestrial laboratory can duplicate the unique space radiation environment. ==Biological science== The BioSentinel biosensor uses the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to detect and measure DNA damage response after exposure to the deep space radiation environment.BioSentinel: Mission Development of a Radiation Biosensor to Gauge DNA Damage and Repair Beyond Low Earth Orbit on a 6U NanosatelliteHugo (PDF). Hugo Sanchez, NASA. 20 April 2016. Two yeast strains were selected for this mission: a wild type strain proficient in DNA repair, and a strain defective in the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), deleterious lesions generated by ionizing radiation. Budding yeast was selected not only because of its flight heritage, but also because of its similarities with human cells, especially its DSB repair mechanisms. The biosensor consists of specifically engineered yeast strains and growth medium containing a metabolic indicator dye. Therefore, culture growth and metabolic activity of yeast cells directly indicate successful repair of DNA damage. After completing the Moon flyby and spacecraft checkout, the science mission phase will begin with the wetting of the first set of yeast-containing wells with specialized media. Multiple sets of wells will be activated at different time points over the 18-month mission. One reserve set of wells will be activated in the occurrence of a solar particle event (SPE). Approximately, a 4 to 5 krad total ionizing dose is anticipated.BioSentinel Presentation 2014 (PDF) Payload science data and spacecraft telemetry will be stored on board and then downloaded to the ground. Biological measurements will be compared to data provided by onboard radiation sensors and dosimeters. Additionally, three identical BioSentinel payloads will be developed for comparison reference, one of them will be exposed at low Earth orbit outside the International Space Station (ISS), where there is a comparatively low- radiation environment due to Earth's magnetic field protecting the space station. ==Spacecraft== Representative heliocentric orbit of the BioSentinel spacecraft The Biosentinel spacecraft will consist on a 6U CubeSat bus format, with external dimensions of approx. 10×20×30 cm and a mass of about . At launch, BioSentinel resides within the second stage on the launch vehicle from which it is deployed to a lunar flyby trajectory and into an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit. Of the total 6 Units volume, 4 Units will hold the science payload, including a radiation dosimeter and a dedicated 3-color spectrometer for each well; 1U will house the ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem) and 1U will house the attitude control thruster assembly, which will be 3D printed all in one piece: cold gas (DuPont R236fa) propellant tanks, lines and seven nozzles.

The attitude control system is being developed and fabricated by the Georgia Institute of Technology. Electric power will be generated by deployable solar panels rated at 30 W, and telecommunications will rely on the Iris transponder at X band. The spacecraft is being developed by NASA Ames Research Center, in collaboration with NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA Johnson Space Center, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, and NASA Headquarters. ==See also== ;The 13 CubeSats flying on the Artemis 1 *Lunar Flashlight will map exposed water ice on the Moon *Near-Earth Asteroid Scout by NASA is a solar sail spacecraft that will encounter a near-Earth asteroid *BioSentinel is an astrobiology mission *SkyFire by Lockheed Martin *Lunar IceCube, by the Morehead State University *CubeSat for Solar Particles (CuSP) *Lunar Polar Hydrogen Mapper (LunaH-Map), designed by the Arizona State University *OMOTENASHI, submitted by JAXA, is a lunar lander *ArgoMoon, designed by Argotec and coordinated by Italian Space Agency *Cislunar Explorers, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York *Earth Escape Explorer (CU-E3), University of Colorado Boulder *Team Miles, by Fluid & Reason, LLC.

A live performance was included on the Bob Dylan and The Band live album Before the Flood. ==Lyrics and music== \\"When You Awake\\" is a ballad. The lyrics concern a young boy who received advice from \\"Ollie,\\" who may be a friend or relative. Ollie tells the boy how difficult life can be; that the boy is a fool, that \\"it's a mean old world,\\" to \\"Be careful where you step and watch what you eat.\\" The boy turns to his grandfather for comfort, His grandfather's words comfort the boy by assuring him of his love, but do not contradict the harsh words from Ollie. Music critic Barney Hoskyns suggests that Ollie and the grandfather may be the same person. Robertson has stated that the song \\"is the story about someone who passes something on to you, and you pass it on to someone else. But it's something you take to heart and carry with you your whole life.\\" According to music critic Nick DeRiso, the lyrics are more about feeling and emotion than literal detail. DeRiso interprets the final verse as the boy singing after he has grown up and reflecting back on the advice he received long ago. The last lines of the song tweak famous lines from the traditional gospel song \\"On the Rock Where Moses Stood\\": :And if I thought it would do any good :I'd stand on the Rock where Moses stood. Rick Danko sings the lead vocal. Manuel plays drums on this song. Robertson plays a Merle Travis-sounding riff on guitar, and Garth Hudson and Manuel play organ and drums with a ragtime sound. Robertson has said that the guitar part was made up of combinations of notes that were not real chords. As a result, the melody didn't sound good when translated to piano, which is why Manuel, normally the group's pianist, moved to drums. Associated Press writer Mary Campbell heard an influence from Bob Dylan's music in \\"the way the tune moves forward.\\" ==Reception== Critics are divided on the merits of the song. Allmusic critic Thomas Ward considers it \\"one of the lesser songs\\" on The Band and considers some of the lyrics \\"trite\\" and the melody \\"rather unengaging (although not unattractive).\\" Ward compares it unfavorably to another Manuel-Robertson song on The Band, \\"Whispering Pines.\\" Hoskyns calls it \\"engaging,\\" particularly praising Danko's \\"folksy vocal.\\" Billboard Magazine regarded the song as one of The Band's \\"most haunting ballads.\\" Billboard described Danko's vocal performance as \\"potent.\\" Band biographer Peter Viney describes it as \\"a strange song in that it breaks up the full blast Americana of the three preceding tracks [on The Band] and the following one. Listen to it again, and it hardly sounds like any kind of rock song at all. Like all their best tracks you grab images as you relisten but you're hard put to connect these images together.\\" DeRiso praises how Danko's vocal provides \\"more than simple emotion, as he climbs to impossible heights, then storms back down with the greatest of ease, but also real insight and no small amount of wit.\\" \\"When You Awake\\" appeared on several of the Band's compilation albums. It appeared as one of the bonus tracks on the 1995 reissue of The Best of the Band. It also appeared on the box set A Musical History. ==Other performances== The Band played \\"When You Awake\\" live on the Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour. When performing the song live, Danko would back away from the microphone at the end of the song to mimic the fade out at the end of the studio recording. A version of the song was included on the 1974 live album Before the Flood. Hoskyns criticizes the performance on Before the Flood as he believes that Danko's voice was worn out from all the previous performances. Critic John Nogowski also criticizes Danko's vocal, and the song itself, as \\"the weakest on the record.\\" Danko performed a solo version of \\"When You Awake\\" on acoustic guitar for the VH1 special Classic Albums - The Band. In this version, he changes Ollie's gender from \\"he\\" to \\"she.\\" This has supported speculation that \\"Ollie\\" was meant to represent Danko's mother Leyola, or Ole for short. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1969 songs Category:The Band songs Category:Songs written by Robbie Robertson Category:Songs written by Richard Manuel Category:Song recordings produced by John Simon (record producer) ","title":"When You Awake"},{"id":"46796045","text":"Velocity Signs is a sign-waving machine manufacturer based in Sacramento, California.

The top 15 teams and the top 9 individuals after 54 holes advanced to the fourth round. The top eight teams after 72 holes advanced to the match play competition. The individual award was given at the end of the stroke play part of the competition, recognizing the individual who had the best combined score over the four rounds. In match play, all five players play just as before and each match is worth one point with matches that end all-square are either postponed then continued, continued immediately or called a halve depending on the scores for both teams. For example, if Team A ties with Team B 2.5–2.5, the match that was all-square after 18 holes resumes in a sudden-death playoff. ==Team competitionLeaderboard=== {   !Place!!Team!!Round 1!!Round 2!!Round 3!!Round 4!!Total!!To par -ccffcc;\\"  1  align=leftSouthern California  297  303  298  294  1192  +40 -ccffcc;\\"  2  align=leftDuke  293  309  292  303  1197  +45 -ccffcc;\\"  3  align=leftBaylor  297  307  306  288  1198  +46 -ccffcc;\\"  4  align=leftStanford  293  323  296  287  1199  +47 -ccffcc;\\"  5  align=leftArizona  300  311  294  300  1205  +53 -ccffcc;\\"  rowspan=2T6  align=leftTennessee  301  309  300  302  rowspan=21212  rowspan=2+60 -ccffcc;\\"  align=leftTexas Tech  319  294  307  292 -ccffcc;\\"  8  align=leftWashington  301  316  297  300  1214  +62 -  9  align=leftArkansas  310  306  303  298  1217  +65 -  10  align=leftNorthwestern  310  301  305  302  1218  +66 -  11  align=leftUC Davis  305  304  306  305  1220  +68 -  12  align=leftPurdue  307  302  302  311  1222  +70 -  13  align=leftWake Forest  310  320  297  297  1224  +72 -  14  align=leftAlabama  310  307  310  299  1226  +74 -  15  align=leftUCLA  319  318  293  303  1233  +81 } Remaining teams: UNLV (931), South Carolina (932), Texas A&M; (933), Tulane (935), LSU (938), Virginia (938), NC State (942), Campbell (950), California (953).

After showing little ability as a two-year-old he improved in the following spring to win the Culford Stakes on his three-year-old debut. He ran third in the 2000 Guineas and was narrowly beaten into second place in the Derby Stakes. After winning the Whepstead Stakes he recorded his biggest win when defeating a strong field in a substitute St Leger. He won his first three races in 1945 and finished second in the Ascot Gold Cup. He later became a successful breeding stallion, siring several major winners including Tulyar. ==Background== Tehran was a bay horse with a white star and a white coronet marking on his left hind foot bredhttp://www.sporthorse- data.com/d?showpic=25265&nm;=3&time;=1404984427 in the United Kingdom by Prince Aly Khan and owned by him in partnership with his father Aga Khan III. He was sired by Bois Roussel, a French-bred horse who won the 1938 Epsom Derby before becoming a successful breeding stallion. His other progeny included the St Leger winner Ridge Wood and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Migoli. Tehran's dam Stafaralla was a successful racehorse and broodmare who won the Cheveley Park Stakes in 1937 and produced the Ebor Handicap winner Norooz. Stafarella was a granddaughter of Miranda, whose other descendants have included Mrs McArdy, Borgia and Foolish Pleasure. The colt was sent into training with the Aga Khan's veteran trainer Frank Butters at his stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Tehran's racing career took place during World War II during which horse racing in Britain was subject to many restrictions. Several major racecourses, including Epsom and Doncaster, were closed for the duration of the conflict, either for safety reasons, or because they were being used by the military. Many important races were rescheduled to new dates and venues, often at short notice, and all five of the Classics were usually run at Newmarket. Wartime austerity also meant that prize money was reduced: Tehran's St Leger was worth £5,467 compared to the £10,465 earned by Scottish Union in 1939. ==Racing career1942: two-year-old season=== As a two-year-old in 1943 Tehran was slow to mature and failed to win or place in two races. On his second appearance he finished fifth behind Ocean Swell in the Alington Maiden Plate at Newmarket Racecourse on 20 October. ===1944: three-year-old season=== Tehran recorded his first success in the Chelford Stakes over one mile at Newmarket in the spring of 1944. On 17 May the colt was moved up in class to contest the 2000 Guineas, run that year on the July course. Racing in heavy rain, Tehran led until the last quarter mile before being overtaken and finishing third of the twenty-six runners behind the filly Garden Path and Growing Confidence. In his subsequent races he ran in the colours of the Aga Khan. In the Derby, run on the July course on 17 June, Tehran started at odds of 8/1 in a twenty-runner field and was ridden by Eph Smith. The race was run at a slow pace before the field quickened five furlong from the finish. After what was described as a \\"great fight\\" he was beaten a neck by the 28/1 outsider Ocean Swell. On his next appearance, Tehran won the Whepstead Stakes at Newmarket in August. Doncaster Racecourse, the traditional home of the St Leger was unavailable for racing in 1944 and substitute \\"New St Leger\\" was run at Newmarket in September. Ridden by Gordon Richards, Tehran started at odds of 9/2 in a field of seventeen runners which also included Ocean Swell and the filly Hycilla, the winner of the Oaks Stakes, who started favourite. He won by one and a half lengths from Lord Derby's colt Borealis with Ocean Swell third. After the race Richards commented \\"I made the first forward move and was followed by Harry Wragg on Borealis. Harry must have got almost to Tehran's head but there was no laziness about Tehran and he went on again. Eph Smith joined in on Ocean Swell but they could make no impression on me as I pushed a good horse home. He got a pace just to his liking\\". Tehran's earnings of £6,202 meant that Butters won his sixth trainers' championship whilst the Aga Khan was British flat racing Champion Owner for the eighth time.http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi- bin/paperspast?a=d&cl;=search&d;=AS19450113.2.97.42&srpos;=6&e;=01-01-1943-31-12-1945 --10--1----0Tehran-- ===1945: four-year-old season=== Tehran remained in training as a four-year-old with the Ascot Gold Cup as his principal objective. He won three minor races as Newmarket in the spring of 1945 but was withdrawn from the substitute Coronation Cup as Butters did not wish to risk the horse on the prevailing hard ground. On 7 July the Gold Cup was run at Ascot for the first time since 1939 in front of an estimated 60,000 spectators. Tehran had been given what was described as \\"a real stayer's preparation\\", being tested in training gallops alongside the Cesarewitch winner Filator.http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43501073? He was, however, unsuited by the firm ground and finished second, one and a half lengths behind the winner Ocean Swell. In December 1945, Tehran was sold to a syndicate for £25,000 a share, giving him a theoretical value of £100,000 and breaking the record price for a racehorse set when Nearco was syndicated for £62,000.http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article95607835? ==Assessment== In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Tehran a \\"superior\\" winner of the St Leger and the best British-trained horse of his generation. ==Breeding record== Tehran was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion. He was not a consistent producer of top-class winners but did produce some very good horses. The best of his progeny was Tulyar, who won the Derby, Eclipse Stakes, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and St Leger enabling Tehran to win the title of Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1952. His other winners included Amante (Irish Oaks), Mystery (Eclipse Stakes), Raise You Ten (Goodwood Cup, Doncaster Cup) and Tabriz (Royal Lodge Stakes, sire of Taboun). Tehran died in 1966 at the age of twenty-five. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:1941 racehorse births Category:1966 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 14-b Category:St Leger winners ","title":"Tehran (horse)"},{"id":"46796157","text":"Wormington Grange Wormington Grange is a Grade II* listed country house in the civil parish of Stanton, Gloucestershire, England. It lies a mile south of the village of Wormington. Although the lodge is of Tudor origins, the main house was constructed in the 1770s for Nathaniel Jeffreys. It is built of stone with a slate roof. An enlargement occurred in 1826-27 for Josiah Gist by Henry Hakewill. In the 1920s, Sir G. Dawber provided minor alterations for Mrs. Clegg. A. S. G. Butler made other changes in the mid 20th century. The full- height bow windows are attributed to Anthony Keck who was the original architect of outstanding Doric columns reminiscent of the classical Greek Temple on the Ilissus. The later additions by Hakewill included notable pilasters, particularly in a dining-room, built in the new east wing, adjacent to a grand entrance hall with ionic columns. The house was later lived in by General Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay, , who remodelled the north side servants' quarters to Butler's design in 1947. Hakewill's stables nearby were neo-classical after Sir Hans Sloane's inspirational style. The Cleggs completely re-designed the gardens to which wrought iron front gates, designed by Norman Jewson appeared in about 1930. The limestone and Sussex bond brickwork stable block, which has a slate roof, was added 1827. The central store room is of twostoreys with single story wings containing the horse boxes. A workshop in the stable block is used by John Evetts, the Landmark Trust furnishing manager. He is the grandson of Hastings Ismay, and moved into the house in the 1970s. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Country houses in Gloucestershire Category:Houses completed in 1779 Category:Grade II* listed houses Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Gloucestershire ","title":"Wormington Grange"},{"id":"46796161","text":"Arrazola de Oñate (also written as de Arrazola Oñate) is a Belgian noble family, stemming from the Arrazola family in the city of Oñati in the Basque Country. Since the 17th century a branch has been living in the Spanish Netherlands, later to become the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and Belgium, holding high functions ranging from the military to feudal lords and councilors.I.S. VANDERWAEREN, Enkele aantekeningen over de Arrazola's de Oñate, in: Oost-Brabant 19-2, 1982 ==Origin== Juan Alexandro Arrazola de Oñate was born around 1580 in the Spanish de Arrazola family and travelled with Isabella and Archduke Albert VII to the Southern Netherlands in order to become their chamberlain. In 1611 he married Beatrix Heath, the daughter of English nobleman Jerome Heath. His Spanish nobility was officially recognized in Flanders and Brabant in 1649.X., \\"Armoiries de la famille de Arrazola Onate y Garibay, certifiées par Diego Barreiro, roi d'armes de Philippe IV d'Espagne, Francisco Mendes, secrétaire du roi, Pierre Delaunay, roi d'armes pour le Brabant, Michiel Maurissens, roi d'armes pour la Flandre\\", 1649, Royal Library of Belgium n° 1433447 On 7 August 1647, King Philip IV of Spain made Juan's son, Marc, a Knight. Marc was Lieutenant general of the Falconers of Flanders and mayor of the Brugse Vrije from 1649 to 1659. The Brugse Vrije was a castellany in the county of Flanders, stretching between the North Sea, Sluis, Eeklo, Hooglede, Zarren and the river Yser. Later on he also became Royal Commissioner for the renewal of Bruges' magistracy in 1655, '66 and '67. He is buried in the Prinsenhof in Bruges.A. DE BEHAULT DE DORNON, Bruges, séjour d’exil des rois d’Angleterre Edouard IV et Charles II, Bruges, 1931 In 1654 Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, then-Governor of the Spanish Netherlands, made Marc's brother Jean-Jacques councilor and auditor in the Court of Accounts of Brabant, and councilor in the Raad van Financiën, managing the domains of the Habsburg ruler and performing the financial management. In addition to the hereditary nobility coupled to this position, Jean-Jacques was granted the title of Knight.L. DUERLOO & P. JANSSENS, Wapenboek van de Belgische Adel, Brussels, 1992 ==Coat of arms== The heraldic coat of arms is argent of colour as a symbol of purity, wisdom, innocence and joy. It features an uprooted oak in vert placed between two sable wolves, symbolising both strength and slyness. ==Castles== Hougoumont during the Battle of Waterloo ===Castle Hougoumont=== The Castle Hougoumont located in Eigenbrakel was property of this Spanish family from mid-17th century until the end of the 18th century. The castle had a high-walled garden, an orchard, a park and was the home of the Lords of Gomont for 5 centuries. A couple of years after the death of the last Lord Arrazola de Oñate de Gomont, a member of the Seven Noble Houses of Brussels, the castle prominently featured in the Battle of Waterloo. The castle was inherited by his widow, who after his death married Philippe Gouret de Louville, a major in the service of Austria. As the officer, 86 years of age, had insufficient funds to rebuild the castle after the Battle of Waterloo, he sold it on May 7, 1816 to François de Robiano. ===Castle of Hombeek=== The Castle of Hombeek, later to be called Castle Carmosteyn, was acquired by Ridder Jan-Jacob from the de Boccabella family in 1670. The moated castle became the property of Jean-Antoine Locquet, 1st Viscount of Hombeke as he became the new Lords of Ophombeek in 1680. Carmosteyn in the 18th century. ===Castle of Meldert=== The feodal Castle of Meldert, build in the second half of the 17th century, was inhabited by the last Lord of Meldert: Marten-Jozef Arrazola de Oñate.L. HEYNENS, Adel in Limburg, Pons Mosae, 2008 Under his tenure the region became a province of the French Republic. All noble privileges were abolished and the final curtain fell for the feudal era. Today, the Arrazola coat of arms is still part of the historical coat of arms of both Meldert and Lummen. The last remains of this castle disappeared in 1871.P.

Rivington Não Rio was Herren's first album since 2011's The Only She Chapters, after which he was told by his label that they would not be accepting more material from him. After the release, he spent his time away from music and then later collaborating with other artists and attempting to start a new label called Yellow Year. After four years since his past album, Herren signed to Temporary Residence Limited and released two EPs along with Rivington Não Rio in 2015. The album received generally favorable reviews. ==Background and production== In 2011, after releasing The Only She Chapters, Herron's eighth album for Warp, the label informed Herren that it would not accept any more material from him. This led to the rights to the master recordings of his material to be kept with the label. Herren was not sure why he was dropped by Warp and felt unsure about what direction to take next. Herren worked with Teebs (real name Mtendere Mandowa) creating a group called Sons of the Morning. In 2013, he launched a label called Yellow Year, which would release an album titled Speak Soon a collaboration between Herren and many contemporary and older musicians including Mandowa and Chung as well as the reclusive Swiss musician Dimitri Grimm, aka Dimlite. Herren embarked on a month-long American tour in January 2014 under the Yellow Year banner, but the album was not released due to creative and operational differences. The remainder of 2014 was spent looking for a label to release his new material. Under the recommendation of musicians Nigel Godrich and Kieran Hebden, Herron signed to Temporary Residence Limited. Including the album, Herron released two EPs through the label in 2015. The music on the EPs was written in a six- month period following the album being handed in at the label. ==Release== Rivington Não Rio was released on May 12, 2015 on the Temporary Residence Limited label. The album was part of a group of releases, including the Forsyth Garden EP on April 28, 2015 and the Every Color of Darkness EP on July 14, 2015. ==Reception== At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 76, based on 6 reviews indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". ==Track listingReferencesExternal links== * Category:2015 albums Category:Prefuse 73 albums Category:Temporary Residence Limited albums ","title":"Rivington Não Rio"},{"id":"46796172","text":"Beatriz Vaz e Silva (born 7 October 1985), commonly known as Bia, is a Brazilian soccer player who plays for Ferroviára in the Campeonato Brasileiro de Futebol Feminino Série A1 in Brazil.

Like others in its genus, it is an obligate parasite growing on the roots of rainforest trees, but differs in that its tuber appears above ground and has an elongated, repeatedly branched, coral-like structure. It was first described in 2014 and is known from fewer than 50 plants, but has not as yet been declared endangered. ==Description== Like other members of its genus, B. coralliformis is holoparasitic and contains no chlorophyll. It forms clumps up to about long above the ground, branching with cylindrical segments up to long and in diameter. There are 4, sometimes 5 yellow to straw-coloured overlapping, concave, egg-shaped leaves, arranged at about the same level around each segment of the above-ground tuber. The leaves are long and wide. The plant is dioecious, having separate pistillate (female) and staminate (male) plants. The flowers appear at the end of each tuber segment, arranged in racemes. The racemes of white male flowers are long, wide and contain 12 to 16 flowers and the female racemes are long, wide and contain many minute, straw-coloured flowers, mostly less than long. ==Taxonomy and naming== Balanophora coralliformis was first formally described in 2014 by Julie Barcelona, Pieter Pelser and Danilo Tandang from a specimen found on the Mount Mingan summit trail in Central Luzon. The specific epithet (coralliformis) refers to the coral-like form of the species' tuber. In 2015, the International Institute for Species Exploration names it as one of the \\"Top 10 New Species\\" for species discovered in 2014. ==Distribution and habitat== The only-known populations of this plant occur in montane mossy forest at altitudes between on the south-west slopes of Mount Mingan. Balanophora papuana is also found in this area. ==Conservation== Fewer than 50 plants of B. coralliformis have been found and none has been observed in similar areas in Nueva Ecija and Aurora provinces but the species has not yet been declared endangered and Mount Mingan is not currently a protected area. However, the habitat of B. coralliformis is threatened by illegal logging and slash and burn agriculture. ==References== coralliformis Category:Flora of the Philippines Category:Plants described in 2014 ","title":"Balanophora coralliformis"},{"id":"46796321","text":"Supreme Soviet elections were held in Abkhazia on 29 September 1991, with a second round on 14 October.

A manor house is record in the 14th century. The manor was surrounded by woodland and a deer park. Lasborough House and its pleasure grounds was built in 1794. In the mid 17th century, the Lasborough manor was made up of two farms which were worked by tenant farmers, that of Lasborough Park and also Bowldown Farm. Lasborough Farm had an old manor- house. The country house Lasborough Park was built in 1794 for Edmund Estcourt by James Wyatt in Tudor Gothic style. In the early 1870s, Lasborough Park was owned by Robert Stayner Holford of Westonbirt House. The house was enlarged and altered in the 19th century. It was later purchased by Galbraith Cole. In 1929, the house was purchased by Maj. R. A. Scott who held it until 1950. It passed to a timber merchant firm in 1952 who cut down trees on the property. In 1954, it was purchased by W.

Established in 1923, it was one of the only places in the community offering summer accommodations to African-Americans during the period of Jim Crow segregation. Prominent guests included Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Count Basie, and Lionel Hampton. The property, which reverted to completely private use by the Cummingses in 1993, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. ==Description and history== Rose and Edward Cummings Jr. purchased 110 Portland Street in 1917, and were Old Orchard Beach's first African-American residents. In 1923 they converted the house into a seasonal boarding house, catering to traveling African-Americans. Although it was not listed in any business directories, it was a popular accommodation, with word at first spread by word of mouth, and later by tour guides specifically targeting African-American vacationers. It regularly played host to African-American performers who played at the Old Orchard Beach Casino, but were refused accommodation at area hotels despite a lack of segregation laws in the state. Performers who stayed there included Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Count Basie, Lionel Hampton, and Harry Carney, who became a regular visitor. The boarding house was operated by the Cummings children until 1993. The house is a vernacular Victorian wood frame structure built about 1870, probably as a farmhouse. The present structure includes the original house and a small barn, which have been joined by a two-story addition. The building once had a porch that wrapped around the southern and eastern facades, provide a measure of unity to the building's disparate elements; this has since been removed. The interior of the house shows regular adaptation to changing environment: its kitchen is from the 1970s, while its bathrooms retain fixtures and original plaster walls from the 1920s. The interior underwent some alteration in the 1960s, when the business began to decline due to antidiscrimination laws, and one of the Cummings children moved into part of the building on a year-round basis. ==See also== *Rock Rest, another Maine property that catered to African-Americans *National Register of Historic Places listings in York County, Maine ==References== Category:Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Victorian architecture in Maine Category:Houses completed in 1923 Category:Houses in York County, Maine Category:Old Orchard Beach, Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in York County, Maine ","title":"Cummings' Guest House"},{"id":"46796392","text":"The New Mutants is a 2020 American horror film in the superhero genre, based on the Marvel Comics team of the same name and distributed by 20th Century Studios. It is the thirteenth and final installment in the X-Men film series. The film was directed by Josh Boone from a screenplay he wrote with Knate Lee, and stars Maisie Williams, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Heaton, Alice Braga, Blu Hunt, and Henry Zaga. In the film, a group of young mutants held in a secret facility fight to save themselves. Boone and Lee first began work on the film after Boone completed The Fault in Our Stars (2014). The pair pitched a potential film trilogy to X-Men producer Simon Kinberg, and in May 2015 were officially signed on to the project. Taylor-Joy and Williams were rumored to be cast in March 2016, and were confirmed over a year later when the rest of the cast filled out. Filming took place in Boston, Massachusetts, from July to September 2017, primarily at Medfield State Hospital, with an April 2018 release in mind. The film was then delayed while reshoots were planned and Disney began the process of acquiring production company 20th Century Fox. After the acquisition was completed, Boone returned to work on the film, and it was completed without reshoots in March 2020. The New Mutants was theatrically released in the United States on August 28, 2020, after facing many delays from its original April 2018 date. The film received mixed reviews, with critics considering the film competent but generic. Originally planned as the first in a trilogy of films, Disney's purchase of Fox reverted the film rights to Marvel Studios, ending the possibility of any sequels. == Plot == Danielle \\"Dani\\" Moonstar, a young Cheyenne Native American, escapes the destruction of her reservation during a tornado. During the chaos, Dani's father William hides her before an unseen entity kills him, leaving her the only survivor. After being knocked unconscious, Dani awakens in a hospital run by Dr. Cecilia Reyes. Reyes comforts Dani, telling her she is a mutant, and advises her to remain in the hospital until she learns what her abilities are and controls them. Dani is introduced to four other young teenagers; Samuel \\"Sam\\" Guthrie, Illyana Rasputin, Roberto \\"Bobby\\" da Costa and Rahne Sinclair. Reyes has brought each of them to the hospital after they have all suffered tragedy; Sam brought down a whole mine on his father and coworkers, Roberto burned his girlfriend to death, Rahne escaped her religiously strict village after being branded as a witch, and Illyana was haunted by her past in child slavery, which manifests itself as otherworldly beings called the \\"Smiling Men\\". All of them are manifesting mutant abilities; Roberto can manipulate solar energy, Sam can fly at jet speed, Illyana has inter-dimensional sorcery powers, and Rahne's lycanthropy allows her to turn into a wolf. Reyes herself is a powerful mutant who keeps her patients from leaving the facility by surrounding it with unbreakable force fields. Collectively, the five of them believe that they are being trained to join the X-Men, hence the strict supervision, as well as Reyes reminding them that they are considered dangerous and should not leave until they have mastered their abilities. Dani immediately befriends Rahne, eventually forming a romantic relationship, while Illyana continues to antagonize Dani. When Dani fights back, she discovers that Illyana's only friend is a hand puppet of a purple dragon who she calls Lockheed. Soon, the group all begin to have horrifying visions of their past tragedies, one of which results in Rahne getting branded in the neck. Illyana deduces that the visions are the result of Dani's powers manifesting; she has the ability to create illusions based on a person's psyche. Reyes consults her employers, the Essex Corporation, who instruct her to collect Dani's DNA and have her euthanized. As Reyes takes Dani away, Rahne suspects that something is wrong. Illyana and Sam are attacked by the Smiling Men while Roberto tries to break through the barrier, which has shrunken down. Dani uses her powers to learn of Reyes's true intentions before Rahne arrives in half-wolf form and mauls Reyes, forcing her to flee. The five regroup and realize that, in order to escape, they have to kill Reyes to deprive the force fields of their power source. They find her and Reyes traps them, revealing that she was training them to be killers for Essex. Before she can crush Dani to death, the entity, Demon Bear, who had been following Dani and was the true reason her reservation was destroyed, arrives and kills Reyes. Illyana summons her powers to jump between \\"limbo\\" and recruits a real life version of Lockheed to take on Demon Bear. Eventually, Sam and Roberto join the fight, overcoming their insecurities in the process. Rahne tries to reach through to an unconscious Dani until she is forced to fight the Demon Bear alone. Dani is visited by her father's spirit, who encourages her to face her fear. Dani awakens and confronts Demon Bear, calming it into submission and allowing it to rest. As day breaks, the group, now calling themselves the New Mutants, learn that the force field is down and head out together to face the unknown. == Cast == * Maisie Williams as Rahne Sinclair / Wolfsbane: A Scottish mutant who can turn into a wolf and is struggling to reconcile this with her religious beliefs. Williams was convinced to join the film after discussing the character's religious background with director Josh Boone, who identified with the comic book character due to his own strict religious upbringing. * Anya Taylor-Joy as Illyana Rasputin / Magik: A Russian mutant with sorcery powers, she can manifest the Soulsword and use teleportation discs to travel. Illyana is the sister of Colossus, a member of the X-Men seen in previous films in the series. She has a purple dragon companion, Lockheed, in the film. Colbi Gannett portrays Illyana as a child. * Charlie Heaton as Samuel \\"Sam\\" Guthrie / Cannonball: An American mutant who can propel himself into the air, and is invulnerable while doing so. * Alice Braga as Dr. Cecilia Reyes: A mentor to the group and a medical doctor who can generate protective fields around herself. * Blu Hunt as Danielle \\"Dani\\" Moonstar / Mirage: A Native American mutant who can create illusions based on the fears and desires of other people. The film includes a love story between Rahne and Dani, which Williams felt was a natural extension of the comic book characters having a telepathic connection. Boone described this as \\"the spine and focus\\" of the film's \\"character-driven stuff\\". * Henry Zaga as Roberto \\"Bobby\\" da Costa / Sunspot: A Brazilian mutant who can manipulate solar energy. * Adam Beach as William Lonestar: Dani's father of Cheyenne descent. Additionally, the character Demon Bear is featured in the film. Thomas Kee appears as Sam Guthrie's father Thomas Guthrie, while Happy Anderson portrays Reverend Craig from Rahne's village; both are the result of illusions created by Dani Moonstar. The Smiling Men are physically portrayed by Dustin Ceithamer while Marilyn Manson provided their voices. == Production  Development === After completing work on the 2014 film The Fault in Our Stars for 20th Century Fox, director Josh Boone created a comic book with his childhood best friend Knate Lee using panels from Chris Claremont and Bill Sienkiewicz's New Mutants comics to illustrate what a potential film trilogy adapting those comics would be like. The pair had been fans of the characters growing up, with Boone calling the stories \\"really dark, interesting, and different from the typical X-Men stories that we had read\\". Boone and Lee took the comic to Simon Kinberg, one of the producers of the X-Men film series, who \\"really liked it\\". In May 2015, Fox finalized a deal to have Boone direct The New Mutants, from a script by himself and Lee, with Kinberg and Lauren Shuler Donner producing. The film was initially intended to expand the universe of the X-Men franchise and take place three years after X-Men: Apocalypse (2016). While working on the first draft of the script, Boone sent it and his ideas for the film to Sienkiewicz, who thought Boone \\"had it figured out\\" and was not just copying the comics. Updating the status of the film in March 2016, Kinberg said that Boone and Lee were working on the script, and that, like Deadpool (2016), the film would be different from the core X-Men films, \\"maybe not as different as Deadpool, but it has its own unique, original voice to it\\". Kinberg said that the film would have a young adult \\"vibe\\", and that there was potential for characters seen in previous films to appear, namely Warpath, Sunspot, and Professor X, who all have ties to the New Mutants in the comics. Also at that time, it was reported that Maisie Williams and Anya Taylor-Joy were being looked at to star in the film as Rahne Sinclair / Wolfsbane and Illyana Rasputin / Magik, respectively. The rest of the title team was expected to consist of the characters Sam Guthrie / Cannonball, Roberto da Costa / Sunspot, and Danielle Moonstar / Mirage. Sunspot previously appeared in X-Men: Days of Future Past, portrayed by Adan Canto, who was not confirmed to be returning for the new film. James McAvoy, who portrayed Professor X in several previous X-Men films, was said to have a significant role in this one, alongside Alexandra Shipp, who was expected to reprise her role of Storm from X-Men: Apocalypse. In May 2016, Kinberg confirmed that the script included Professor X, and stated his hope for filming to start at the beginning of 2017. By that August, the titular team's roster had expanded to include the character Warlock, while Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber—who worked with Boone writing The Fault in Our Stars—were working on a new draft of the script while Boone and Lee were busy on another project. In November, the report of Williams and Taylor-Joy's casting was believed to be accurate, and Nat Wolff was being looked at for the role of Cannonball after working with Boone on The Fault in Our Stars. The character Demon Bear was set as the film's main antagonist, with the project aiming for more of a \\"'Stephen King meets John Hughes'-style horror movie\\". Boone soon noted that the Demon Bear was a very personal villain for him as a child, as he \\"was raised by very religious parents. They were Evangelical Southern Baptists and they believed in the rapture; they believed the devil was real; they believed in demons.\\" === Pre- production === The film entered pre-production in Boston, Massachusetts, in April 2017, in preparation for filming to begin in that city. Location scouting took place, including at Medfield State Hospital which was previously used as a filming location for Shutter Island (2010). Fox scheduled New Mutants for an April 13, 2018 release. Several weeks later, the studio officially announced the casting of Taylor-Joy and Williams, and was \\"making serious efforts to find ethnically appropriate actors\\" for the rest of the cast, searching for South American and Native American actors to respectively play Sunspot and Moonstar. By then, McAvoy was no longer slated to appear in the film; Wolff was no longer in the running to portray Cannonball; and Karen Rosenfelt was producing alongside Kinberg, who ultimately spent much of production focused on making Dark Phoenix (2019). At the end of May, Henry Zaga was expected to be cast as Sunspot, and Rosario Dawson—who also portrays the Marvel character Claire Temple across the various Marvel Netflix television series—was in talks to join the film as Cecilia Reyes, a mentor to the titular team. It was explained that McAvoy was no longer involved due to Professor X being written out of the script with further drafts, and Shipp's Storm had likewise been written out of the film. Illyana's brother Colossus, another character seen in previous X-Men films, also does not appear despite being included in early versions of the script, with Boone choosing to save him for future films. Boone confirmed the film would be \\"a full-fledged horror movie set within the X-Men universe. There are no costumes. There are no supervillains. We're trying to do something very, very different.\\" He had previously said that he does not like horror films, except for \\"classic ones\\" such as The Exorcist (1973), Rosemary's Baby (1968), and The Shining (1980), but was looking to \\"pioneer and champion doing prestige versions of horror films\\" based on his love for horror novels such as King's works. At the end of the month, Charlie Heaton was in talks to portray Cannonball. Zaga, Dawson, and Heaton were confirmed to have been cast at the start of June, and newcomer Blu Hunt was cast as Moonstar after an extensive and challenging international search that prioritized \\"ethnic authenticity\\". The character was believed to be central to the Demon Bear storyline that the film focuses on. At the end of that month, Dawson exited the film, and Alice Braga was cast as Reyes in her place. The final shooting script for the film included contributions from Scott Frank, Josh Zetumer, Chad and Carey Hayes, Seth Grahame-Smith, Neustadter and Weber, along with a six-person \\"writer's room\\" that Fox hired to generate ideas for the film and also \\"tear apart the script and put it back together\\". Throughout the development process on the film, the script evolved from the \\"full horror\\" film that Boone and Lee initially wanted to make, and which Fox was resistant to, to a compromise version without \\"excessive blood and scares\\" and more \\"young adult\\"-focused. Boone created storyboards with artist Ashley R. Guillory to plan out all of the shots before filming. The casting of Henry Zaga as Roberto da Costa was met with some controversy. Zaga, while Brazilian in real life, portrays a character who in the comics is of Afro-Brazilian descent. Boone stated, \\"my goal was to cast a real Brazilian and I saw 300 of myself black, brown, lighter-skinned. I saw every shade of the sun. It was the same case with Blu Hunt...My goal was to find the best actor who, because they've done so little work, was at least the closest to kind of what I saw in my head for the character...maybe if Henry didn't exist, I would have found somebody who was darker skinned who exemplified what I needed. But it was never about the color of their skin for me.\\" He added that he was not concerned with the real life racism that existed in Brazil and that he wanted the character to be a positive representation of the nation. === Filming === Principal photography began on July 10, 2017, in Boston, under the working title Growing Pains. Peter Deming served as cinematographer for the film. The majority of the film was shot on location at Medfield State Hospital, where Boone said every crew member had \\"weird things happen to them\\". Boone wanted to use practical effects as much as possible to make the film feel like the horror movies that he grew up with. For example, he had actors push on sheets of spandex to create the effect of figures pushing through the walls of a room, a technique originated by Wes Craven. Ten percent of the film used green screen. On the film's set, Boone explained that the script had been re-written following the failure of Apocalypse to be set during modern day rather than in the 1980s, which is why Professor X and Storm were removed from the film's story. Boone felt the film was not largely affected by this change since its confined location and lack of technology meant \\"it might as well be the 80s in terms of the setting. It didn't change our story very much.\\" Fox chairman and CEO Stacey Snider described the film's setting as a Breakfast Club detention crossed with a Cuckoo's Nest institution. She said the film was \\"a haunted-house movie with a bunch of hormonal teenagers. We haven't seen a superhero movie whose genre is more like The Shining than we're teenagers let's save the world. Boone was also influenced by A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987). He explained that Warlock had been deemed too expensive to portray on the film's budget, but could appear in a sequel, and clarified that the Demon Bear would not be the main antagonist of the film, but would appear since the film was \\"very much inspired\\" by the comics in which that character is the main villain. Filming also took place in the Massachusetts towns of Millis, Lynn, and Weymouth, and ended on September 16, 2017. The film's principal photography was described as \\"stressful\\" for Boone, who felt \\"a bit neutered\\" during the process due to having to tone down the film from his original \\"full horror\\" ideas. === Post-production ===  Initial cut  Boone and his regular editors Matthew Dunell and Robb Sullivan delivered a cut of the film to Fox that they were happy with, and it tested as well as initial screenings of Deadpool did. Three days of additional photography were planned to complete the \\"YA movie\\" that Boone, Lee, and Fox had agreed to make. However, following the successful release of the film It (2017), the studio cut the first trailer for The New Mutants to focus on the \\"scary elements from the film, essentially selling it as a straight-up horror movie\\". This proved a success, and Fox decided to make the film more like Boone's original vision rather than completing the version that they had been making during production.  Planned reshoots  In January 2018, the film's release date was pushed back to February 22, 2019. This allowed it to avoid Deadpool 2 (2018), which had just been moved to a date that would have had both films in theaters at the same time in certain markets. It also allowed time for the reshoots required to make the film more frightening. When asked about this delay the next month, Williams stated that there had been concerns during filming regarding the short turnaround from the end of photography to the previously set release date, especially with the amount of visual effects still needed to finish the film, and so in her opinion the delay was \\"for the better\\". The additional photography was soon set for mid-2018. It was expected to include the addition of several new characters who would be appearing throughout the film rather than just making cameo appearances. Fox again delayed the film's release in March 2018, moving it away from the new February 2019 release date for Dark Phoenix to August 2, 2019; by then, the reshoots required for the film were believed to be more extensive than previously considered, with the studio now wanting at least half of the film to be reshot. The studio's focus was on making the film as distinct from the other entries in the series as Deadpool and Logan (2017), while avoiding the film becoming a \\"flop\\" like Fantastic Four (2015) which went through similar production issues—industry insiders believed The New Mutants would not end up the same way due to Fox not blaming the issues on Boone as the studio did with Fantastic Four director Josh Trank, and also because the studio was allowing Boone to write and direct the reshoots in order to complete his original vision. In addition to the reshoots changing the tone of the film, they were also reportedly adjusting an antagonist subplot in the film: The New Mutants was originally going to feature the Essex Corporation, which was first teased at the end of X-Men: Apocalypse, leading to a post-credits scene featuring the surprise reveal of Jon Hamm as the villain Mister Sinister. However, Fox decided against doing this following the failure of Apocalypse and so the reshoots would include a new post-credits scene introducing Antonio Banderas as Sunspot's father Emmanuel da Costa. Kinberg later denied that an actor was ever cast as Mister Sinister when he revealed that the character had been intended to be included in the canceled Gambit film.  Disney acquisition  Reshoots for the film were expected to begin by the end of September 2018, with Kinberg confirming that they were mostly focused on making the film more frightening after the positive response to the horror-inspired trailer. He added that \\"audiences really embraced the notion of a superhero movie or a comic book movie that was, in its core, a horror film\\". Following the acquisition of Fox by Disney in March 2019, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that the planned reshoots had still not taken place and there were \\"none planned so far\\". The report indicated that further movement on the film appeared to be dependent on Boone, and that there was a chance the film may not be released per its Fox release schedule and could instead be released on Disney+ or Hulu, both streaming services owned by Disney. A month later at CinemaCon 2019, Disney confirmed that the film was still planned but indicated that its release date could be adjusted to better fit within Disney's existing schedule. A month after that, the studio pushed the film's release back to April 3, 2020, and the reshoots were set to take place later in 2019. Kinberg explained that the reshoots had taken so long to schedule because the creative team was still deciding what to reshoot, and because of difficulty finding time to get the cast together again due to their commitments to various television series. In August 2019, Disney was said to be unimpressed with The New Mutants, believing it had \\"limited box office potential\\". At the end of the month, this was reported to be the studio's impression of the original cut of the film. Further work had been completed on the film since Disney acquired it to align the film with Boone's original vision, and test screenings with these changes had been positive. In addition to making the film more frightening, these changes reportedly included removing connections to the X-Men films to give Disney's Marvel Studios the option to retroactively include the film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). However, the film as released does make reference to the previous entries, with the inclusion of the Essex Corporation connecting the film to the post-credits scene of Apocalypse and Logan. Sienkiewicz confirmed in December that work on the film had been taking place and that, based on a new trailer he had seen, the style of Marvel Studios appeared to have had an impact on the tone of the film. At the end of the month, Boone said the latest version of the film followed his original vision, a comment that was interpreted by some to mean no reshoots had taken place. In January 2020, Disney's official fan club website D23 described the film as a \\"new addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe\\", a claim that was quickly picked up by fans and reporters. Soon after the claim was noticed, all mentions of the film were removed from the website. Disney later confirmed that this was an error and the film would not be part of the MCU.  Final cut  On March 7, 2020, Boone stated that the film was complete. Shortly after, he explained that work on the film had halted when Disney's acquisition of Fox had begun and so no reshoots ever took place on the film, even standard pickups that had already been scheduled during initial production. At that time, around 75 percent of the film had been edited while much of the film's visual effects were also not finished. By the time the acquisition was completed, Boone had moved on and was about to begin work on a new television series, The Stand, based on the Stephen King novel. Before he started production on that series, Disney asked Boone if he would return to finish the film. Dunell and Sullivan were committed to working on The Stand at that point and could not continue editing The New Mutants, so Boone brought on editor Andrew Buckland to help finish the film. The work required to finish the film when Boone returned involved completing the visual effects and editing alongside co-writer Lee, which took several months. Reshoots for the film could have been scheduled at that point, but Boone found that the cast had aged too much since principal photography had taken place. He also felt it did not make sense to add the post-credit scenes of Banderas since it was unlikely that they would be able to make a sequel now that Disney owned the X-Men rights and was integrating the property into the MCU. Describing returning to the film after so long, Boone said, \\"we hadn't seen it in a year. We did a bunch of things here and there that we hadn't thought about or noticed a year before.\\" The visual effects that still needed to be finished included Illyana's sorceress abilities, including her Soulsword that she materializes, as well as her dragon companion Lockheed. Visual effects for the film were provided by DNEG, Method Studios, and Moving Picture Company, with Olivier Dumont serving as VFX supervisor. After the film was completed, Boone reunited the cast for the first official screening in New York City, after which Williams stated, \\"The movie is exactly the movie we set out to make.\\" Disney removed The New Mutants from its release schedule, along with several other films, on March 12, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and was looking to reschedule the film's release to a later 2020 date. On May 4, the film was automatically listed for home media pre-order on Amazon based on the film's previous April 2020 release date. Amazon took the listing down hours later after it had been widely reported on. At that time, the film was still expected to receive a theatrical release rather than be released straight-to- streaming as other films had been during the pandemic. Shortly after, Disney scheduled the film for release on August 28, 2020. == Music == Nate Walcott and Mike Mogis were confirmed in December 2017 to be composing the score for the film, having worked with Boone on his previous films. In May 2018, Marilyn Manson announced that his cover of the song \\"Cry Little Sister\\"—originally written for the film The Lost Boys (1987) by Gerard McMahon—which Manson debuted during his Heaven Upside Down tour, had been recorded specifically for the New Mutants soundtrack. In February 2020, Mark Snow was revealed to have composed the score for the final version of the film, though additional music composed by Walcott and Mogis was still set to be used in the soundtrack. == Marketing == The first trailer for the film was released in October 2017, on Friday the 13th, with a horror focus inspired by the success of the film It, which had been released the month before. Sara Vilkomerson of Entertainment Weekly felt that trailer delivered on Boone's promise of a different type of X-Men film, and was \\"creepy\\". Vilkomerson also noted the trailer's use of Pink Floyd's \\"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\\"; the title treatment for the film introduced in the trailer evokes the treatment used for that song. Alex McLevy, writing for The A.V. Club, also felt that Boone had delivered on his promise of a \\"straight-up horror film\\", and said, \\"Congrats to this creative team for trying something different with the superhero genre.\\" Writing for /Film, Hoai-Tran Bui said the film looked like a bottle episode for the X-Men franchise, and noted that telling a standalone story led to success for Deadpool. Bui also compared the trailer's tone to Stranger Things (in which Heaton also stars as Jonathan Byers), and Braga's performance as Reyes to Nurse Ratched. Boone, Lee, Braga, Zaga, and Sienkiewicz promoted the film at a 2017 Comic Con Experience panel, where they also talked about their plans for future films. A new trailer, incorporating the changes made to the film following Disney's acquisition of Fox, was released on January 6, 2020. Boone sent the trailer to Sienkiewicz in December 2019, and the comic book artist praised it as \\"phenomenal\\". He stated that the horror elements of the film were still present in the trailer, but that it now also appeared to have been influenced by the style of Disney's Marvel Studios who he said had appeared to give the latest version of the film \\"the blessings of Marvel\\". Aja Romano of Vox also compared the horror elements of this trailer to Stranger Things, and felt the film looked like \\"highly entertaining, if predictable, fun\\". io9s Charles Pulliam-Moore praised the more comic-accurate superhero abilities included in the new trailer, especially Magik's, and felt that the less superhero-like elements could be what saves the film from being a \\"flop\\" like Dark Phoenix. Writing about the trailer for Forbes, Scott Mendelson said the film \\"seems to be pretty similar in content and tone to what was always promised\\", and discussed its interesting position as \\"just a movie\\" now that the X-Men franchise had ended and future New Mutants films were unlikely after Marvel Studios took control of mutant-based films. Weeks before the film's then-set April 2020 release date, Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter discussed several television spots released for the film. He stated that the first two, titled \\"Awaken\\" and \\"Escape\\", followed the tone and style of the previous trailers, while the third one, \\"Attitude\\", presented the film more like a traditional superhero film, focusing on action, quips, and superpowers. McMillan felt this was an abrupt shift in marketing given \\"Attitude\\" was released just one week after the other two spots and questioned whether the change in tone was to align the marketing to the film or just an attempt to boost interest in the film by reminding audiences of other popular superhero films. A panel for the film was held during the virtual 2020 Comic-Con@Home convention, with Boone and members of the cast. A teaser for the film, to announce the panel, was also released. Ethan Anderton from /Film felt Taylor- Joy had \\"a great moment referencing herself\\" as Magik in the teaser and felt the footage \\"doesn't look half-bad\\", though he could not say he was excited for the film because of its extensive delays. Anderton also questioned if the film would hold its then-set August 28, 2020 release date, given higher profile films like Tenet and Mulan had shifted back into August, and wondered if the Comic-Con panel would announce a new theatrical release date or a move to Disney+. Germain Lussier at io9 also felt Disney would use the Comic-Con panel to announce new release plans for the films, but the panel reaffirmed the film's August 28 theatrical release date while acknowledging the film's many delays. The film's opening scene was revealed during the panel, which Sienkiewicz joined to discuss a new poster he had drawn for the film. == Release == The New Mutants was released in the United States on August 28, 2020. It was originally set to be released on April 13, 2018, before being delayed to February 22, 2019, to avoid Deadpool 2, and then to August 2, 2019, to avoid Dark Phoenix. It was delayed to April 3, 2020, by Disney after that studio acquired Fox, and then removed from Disney's schedule in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Disney rescheduled the film for August 28, 2020 two months later. The various delays have led to several online commentators referring to the film as \\"cursed\\" and lamenting its bad luck. Boone and the film's cast acknowledged this curse during the 2020 Comic-Con@Home convention, which included a \\"cheeky teaser trailer\\" that recounted the film's release dates and ended with a \\"Fingers Crossed\\" note beside the August 28 date. Boone also revealed the various contracts signed for the film guaranteed a theatrical release, preventing it from first being released on either Disney+ or Hulu. === Home media === The New Mutants is scheduled to be released on DVD, Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on November 17, 2020. == Reception  Box office === , The New Mutants has grossed $22.7 million in the United States, and $21 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $43.7 million. Originally tracking to debut to around $20 million in the United States before the COVID-19 pandemic, The New Mutants was projected to gross $5–10 million from 2,412 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $3.1 million on its first day, including $750,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $7 million, finishing first at the box office. With 62% of theaters in the country open (operating at 25-50% capacity), the audience was 66% male, with 61% being between 18 and 34. In its second weekend the film fell 59% to $2.9 million, despite adding over 340 theaters, finishing second behind newcomer Tenet, then made $2.1 million in its third weekend and $1.6 million in its fourth. Internationally, the film was released day-in-date with the U.S. in 10 countries and made $2.9 million over its first weekend, including $1.1 million in France, $500,000 in Spain, and $400,000 in Taiwan. Expanding to 30 countries in its second weekend the film made another $4.2 million. === Critical response === On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 34% based on 90 reviews, with an average rating of 4.80/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"Rendering a list of potentially explosive ingredients mostly inert, The New Mutants is a franchise spinoff that's less than the sum of its super-powered parts.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 43 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, Jordan Mintzer said, \\"Generic and, at its best, straining to be heartfelt, director Josh Boone's adaptation of the Marvel spin-off comic series is a Marvel movie spinoff in its own right, making vague references to the X-Men franchise but attempting to stand on its own. Unfortunately it rarely does, even if the film's trio of young and tough female leads manages to give your typically male-dominated genre something of a feminine twist.\\" Peter Debruge of Variety said, \\"Despite all the meddling and interference the film reportedly went through, The New Mutants feels pretty coherent in the end. What it doesn't achieve is a memorable personality of its own.\\" Amy Nicholson of The New York Times wrote, \\"Directed in 2017 by Josh Boone... The New Mutants spent three years on ice before being allowed to escape into the slowest summer season in a century. That's fitting for a film that's all buildup and no bang.\\" The Globe and Mails Barry Hertz gave the film 1.5 out of 4 stars, writing, \\"Instead of funnelling his inspirations into one singular vision that he could call his own, Boone has made a Frankenstein of a franchise movie, a giant elevator pitch that leads directly to the sub-basement of originality.\\" In the days leading up to the film's release, several major publications, including RogerEbert.com, IndieWire, The A.V. Club, and The Boston Globe, refused to review the film, citing Disney's lack of socially distanced press screenings or digital streaming links and noting that it was not safe to attend a traditional public screening due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The New Mutants comics co-creator, Bob McLeod, expressed his disappointment with the film for inaccurately depicting the characters, including whitewashing Roberto, who is dark-skinned in the comics. He also criticized the film for misspelling his name in the credits as \\"MacLeod\\". == Future == Boone and Lee originally pitched the film to Kinberg as the first in a trilogy. In October 2017, Boone said that the characters Warlock and Karma would appear in the sequels. In December, Boone and Lee revealed that they were interested in filming the first sequel in Brazil and that Sunspot's father Emmanuel da Costa would play a role in the franchise. Explaining his plans for the sequels, Boone said that he wanted each film in the trilogy to be a different kind of horror movie. The first film is a \\"'rubber-reality' supernatural horror movie\\", the second film would have been an alien invasion film featuring Warlock, and the third film would have been an apocalyptic horror film inspired by the 1989 comic book crossover storyline \\"Inferno\\". Boone confirmed that the second film would have been set in Brazil and included Antonio Banderas as Emmanuel da Costa. Karma was to be introduced as the villain of the sequel but would have joined the New Mutants by the end of the film alongside Warlock. Boone added that Emmanuel da Costa's connections to the Hellfire Club would have been explored in the first sequel, and said the overall tone of that film would still have been inspired by Claremont and Sienkiewicz's run. Boone had wanted Sacha Baron Cohen to portray Warlock through motion capture, and had discussed the role with Cohen during production on the first film. In March 2019, Disney officially acquired Fox and gained the film rights to several Marvel Comics characters for Marvel Studios, including the New Mutants. The Marvel-based films that Fox had been developing were placed \\"on hold\\". In March 2020, Boone stated that while it was unlikely that a sequel to The New Mutants could be made now that X-Men characters were being integrated into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he still hoped that the film would be successful enough to allow a sequel to be made. That August, Boone confirmed that there were no plans to incorporate the film into the MCU. == References  External links == * * Category:2020 LGBT- related films Category:2020 horror films Category:2020s horror thriller films Category:2020s science fiction films Category:2020s science fiction horror films Category:2020s superhero films Category:2020s teen horror films Category:20th Century Studios films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:American films Category:American horror films Category:American horror thriller films Category:American science fantasy films Category:American science fiction films Category:American science fiction horror films Category:American science fiction thriller films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:American teen horror films Category:Demons in film Category:Films about witchcraft Category:Films based on works by Chris Claremont Category:Films directed by Josh Boone Category:Films postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Films produced by Karen Rosenfelt Category:Films produced by Lauren Shuler Donner Category:Films produced by Simon Kinberg Category:Films scored by Mark Snow Category:Films set in 2020 Category:Films shot in Boston Category:Lesbian- related films Category:Superhero films featuring female antagonists Category:Superhero horror films Category:Teen superhero films Category:Teen thriller films Category:Werewolves in film Category:X-Men (film series) ","title":"The New Mutants (film)"},{"id":"46796429","text":"Francesco Busti (1678–1767) was an Italian painter of the late-Baroque and Neoclassical periods. ==Biography== He was born in Perugia.

The services operate on the Liverpool to Manchester (via Chat Moss) and Liverpool to Wigan lines. As a result of complete electrification of these lines by state track operator Network Rail, they became capable of taking more trains at a higher speed and with raised reliability. The first complete day of Northern Electrics services was 22 May 2015. Class 323s and Class 331s also operate on these services, but it is largely unknown if they are a part of Northern Electrics. ==History== State rail infrastructure owner Network Rail began electrification of the lines between Manchester and Liverpool in 2013 as part of its Northern Hub upgrade programme. The work was completed in February 2015. The first electric services between Liverpool and Manchester commenced on 5 March 2015—the first service operated by Northern Electrics being the Liverpool Lime Street to Manchester Airport route. As part of Northern Rail's plans for operation of the newly electrified Liverpool to Manchester lines, an initial 20 Class 319/3 units were transferred from Thameslink following a repaint and internal refresh. 12 units launched the services early in 2015, with the remaining 8 units due to enter traffic for Northern Electrics in September the same year. The Class 319s have largely replaced Class 142 Pacer, Class 150 Sprinter and Class 156 Super Sprinter diesel multiple units that were once the mainstay of services between Liverpool and Manchester. Several class 323 units started working on most Northern Electrics services from May 2018 after the Liverpool to Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Piccadilly to Manchester Airport services as well as an extension to Crewe station from Manchester Airport station combined to make a new Liverpool Lime street to Crewe service. In July 2019, Class 331s (alongside Class 195) were also introduced on Northern, operating most of the lines on Northern Electrics. In August 2019, it was confirmed that all 319s would leave Northern to be replaced by 17 Class 323 units operated by West Midlands Trains. This is expected to occur once new rolling stock is in operation with West Midlands Trains in 2021. ==Branding== The Northern Electrics livery is different to the standard Northern Rail livery - featuring \\"Northern Electrics\\" logos and a different design which has a greater emphasis on purple. ==Routes== , the routes operated by Northern Electrics are: * Liverpool Lime Street to Manchester Airport (1 tph) * Liverpool Lime Street to Manchester Victoria (1 tph) * Liverpool Lime Street/Liverpool South Parkway to Preston (1 tph) * Liverpool Lime Street to Wigan North Western (2 tph) * Liverpool Lime Street to Warrington Bank Quay (1 tph) * Manchester Piccadilly to Manchester Airport (1 tph) * Liverpool Lime Street to Blackpool North (1 tph) (Introduced in 2018) * Liverpool Lime Street to Crewe (1 tph) (Introduced in 2018) When Northern Electrics was introduced, there were limited services to/from Blackpool North which were still DMUs and this route was not electrified at the time. On weekends, services between Liverpool and Warrington Bank Quay were still operated by Class 150s, Class 142s and Class 156 units as fewer class 319s operated on weekends. The 18:00 service from Liverpool Lime Street to Preston, the 06:44 service from Wigan North Western to Liverpool Lime Street, the 07:38 service from Manchester Victoria to Liverpool Lime Street and the 08:38 service from Manchester Victoria to Liverpool Lime Street were run by DMUs on Saturdays. All diesel traction was gradually phased out after all class 319 units were delivered. Several class 323 units also started working on most Northern Electrics services from May 2018 after the Liverpool to Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Piccadilly services combined to make a new service. Class 331s also worked aside from the class 319s and class 323s from July 2019. Further services between Liverpool/Manchester and Preston/Blackpool were added when Network Rail completed electrification of the Preston to Blackpool lines in 2018. ==Rolling stock== {  - f9f9f9;\\" ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Fleet ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Image ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Type ! colspan=\\"2\\" Top speed ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Number ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Routes operated ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Built - f9f9f9;\\" !mph !km/h - rowspan=2Class 319/3 & 319/4 rowspan=2150px align=centerEMU align=center100 align=center161 align=center24 (319/3), 8 (319/4)  * Liverpool Lime Street–Manchester Airport * Liverpool Lime Street–Manchester Victoria * Liverpool Lime Street–Wigan North Western * Liverpool Lime Street-Warrington Bank Quay * Liverpool Lime Street/Liverpool South Parkway-Preston * Manchester Piccadilly- Manchester Airport * Liverpool Lime Street-Blackpool North * Liverpool Lime Street-Crewe Further services between Liverpool/Manchester and Preston/Blackpool upon completion of electrification. align=center1990 (319/3) 1987-88 (319/4) - colspan=6800px - } ==Gallery== File:319363 at Liverpool Lime Street (1).jpg319363 at Liverpool Lime Street File:Interior of 319363, near Newton-le-Willows.jpgInterior of 319363, near Newton-le-Willows File:Side of northern 319380.JPGSide of Northern 319380 File:Northern Electric Class 319, 319380, platform 6, Wigan North Western railway station (geograph 4499923).jpg319380 at Wigan North Western File:319363 departs Manchester Oxford Road (1).jpg319363 at Manchester Oxford Road ==References== * Porterbrook Brochure Category:2015 establishments in England Category:Railway services introduced in 2015 Category:Nederlandse Spoorwegen Category:Rail transport in Merseyside Category:Rail transport in Greater Manchester Category:Regional rail in the United Kingdom Category:Electric railways in the United Kingdom ","title":"Northern Electrics"},{"id":"46796549","text":"Elections to the People's Council were held in Abkhazia on 13 February 1919, alongside parliamentary elections in Georgia. ==Results== The Social Democrats won 27 of the 40 seats; 11 members of the party were Abkhazians and 11 Georgians, with the remaining five having other ethnicities.Zurab Paparskiri (2008) \\"Abkhazia and the Abkhazians in the common Georgian ethno-cultural political and state exspanse, Part II\\", The Caucasus & Globalisation, Vol 2, Issue 4, pp95–107 Seats were also held by social federalists, an Abkhaz independent socialist group, social revolutionaries, people's democrats and colonists.

Terranova has published the monograph Network Culture. Politics for the Information Age, as well as a more extensive number of essays and speeches, and appeared as a keynote speaker in several conferences. She lectures on the digital media cultures and politics in the Department of Human and Social Sciences, at the University of Naples, 'L'Orientale' ==Theories== Maybe best known part of Terranova's work is her thesis, formulated in the early 2000s, that the free labor of users is the source of economic value in the digital economy. Free labor as a concept is rooted in Italian post-workerist and autonomist labor theories of value, such as Paolo Virno's re-reading of Marx's notion of the general intellect, Antonio Negri's theory of the social factory, and Maurizio Lazzarato's concept of immaterial labor. Free labor is free both in the sense that the laborers provide it voluntarily and in the sense that they are not remunerated by the beneficiaries of the labor (such as social media companies). As such, free labor is only the most extreme form of social labor receiving very little or no monetary compensation. For instance, Terranova describes the university as a 'diffuse factory': 'an open system opening onto the larger field of casualised and underpaid ‘socialised labour power’.' Terranova has also argued that non-hierarchical, open access, free association, and non-monetary P2P networks may provide a post-capitalist social and economic infrastructure. ==Bibliography (selected)Books=== * Network Culture.

She is believed to be the only remaining individual who knows the species' migratory route from Syria to wintering grounds in Ethiopia. The annual migration is fundamental to the continued survival in Syria of the species, which is close to extinction in the wild. ==Background== Zenobia, a female northern bald ibis, was named for Zenobia, a 3rd-century Queen of the Palmyrene Empire. She is an adult who has nested with her male companion Odeinat. A 1930 survey reported 3000 individuals of the species around Birecik, Turkey, but in 1990 the wild population in Turkey was declared extinct, at least in part because of the use of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) insecticide and other human activity. However, in the 1970s and 1980s a captive breeding population was established in the area; these birds were kept in aviaries during the winter, then released in the spring to mate and breed in nearby cliffs; in the autumn they were recaptured for the winter. Thus these birds could survive without knowing the winter migration route used by members of the species in the wild. The northern bald ibis was thought to be extinct in the Middle East until about 2005, when seven of the birds were spotted nesting near Palmyra. However, by 2012 the Palmyra population had declined to four, of which Zenobia is one. ==Ongoing threat== —Tagged Syrian breeders migrated south through Yemen in 2006 and returned via Eritrea. —Birds from Birecik visited the Syrian colony at Palmyra. Guards loyal to Syrian President Assad, who were protecting some of the few remaining birds, fled Palmyra in mid-2015 as a result of fighting between Syrian government forces and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; since that time, it is unknown whether the birds, including Zenobia, are still alive. The British Broadcasting Corporation reported that Zenobia is \\"the only remaining bird who knows the migration routes to wintering grounds in Ethiopia. Without her, birds bred in captivity cannot learn the migration routes and the species could become extinct in the wild in Syria, according to ornithologists.\\" The Society for the Protection of Nature in Lebanon has offered a US$1,000 reward for information on the whereabouts of Zenobia. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Last Northern Bald Ibis in Syria?, Northern Bald Ibis conservation project in Morocco *Les Ibis chauves Salam, Sultan et Zenobia suivis par satellite *Hopes to save the most threatened bird in the Middle East (includes a photograph of Zenobia), International Union for Conservation of Nature Category:Ibises Category:Birds of Western Asia Category:Birds of the Middle East Category:Individual birds Category:Birds of East Africa Category:Individual wild animals ","title":"Zenobia (bird)"},{"id":"46796901","text":"Sergei Vladimirovich Dementyev (; born 25 June 1971) is a former Russian football player. ==External links== * Category:1971 births Category:Footballers from Makhachkala Category:Living people Category:Soviet footballers Category:FC SKA Rostov-on-Don players Category:Russian footballers Category:FC Rostov players Category:Russian Premier League players Category:FC Tyumen players Category:FC KAMAZ Naberezhnye Chelny players Category:Association football midfielders Category:FC Orenburg players ","title":"Sergei Dementyev"},{"id":"46796911","text":"Phineas Waller (January 31, 1774 – June 3, 1859) was an American landowner and the father of David Jewett Waller, Sr. In the first part of the 1800s, he worked as a farmer and distiller, but in 1823, he moved to his father's farm in Oaquago, New York. While in New York, he created the failed village of Wallersville and attempted to build a bridge across the Susquehanna River. In 1836, he returned to Pennsylvania and purchased a number of tracts of land. ==Early life== Waller was born on January 31, 1774, in Wilkes-Barre. He was the first child of Nathan Waller and Elizabeth (Weeks) Waller. When he was an infant, at the beginning of the American Revolutionary War, his family temporarily relocated to Connecticut. By 1799, Waller was one of 121 taxable residents in an area in and around Wilkes-Barre, which was then a village. ==Career== In April 1816, Waller was one of three viewers of the second petition to create a new township in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, Dallas Township. The other two viewers were Anderson Dana and David Richard. While in the Wilkes-Barre area, Waller was a farmer and distiller. He was listed as such on an 1818 directory of Wilkes-Barre businessmen. Waller gained land in the vicinity of Wilkes-Barre and built a home there, but moved to his father's farm near Oquago, New York (also known as Windsor) in 1823. His children David Jewett and Nathan P. were left in Pennsylvania, but occasionally came to visit his farm. He also mined iron ore and coal while in the area. Additionally, he developed the village of Wallersville and gained approval for a post office by that name. He served as the postmaster from 1831 to 1836. To enhance the area's postal service, he established a line of mail coaches running from Utica, New York, to New York City via Oquago and Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania. The village of Wallersville never succeeded and its post office was closed in 1836. Waller also attempted to construct a toll bridge across the Susquehanna River at Wallersville. However, this endeavor failed and a similar bridge was built further upriver by others. In 1836, Waller sold his farm to his son Nathan P. and returned to the Wyoming Valley, where he purchased some more tracts of land. By the time of his death, he owned a considerable amount of land in the Wyoming Valley, including two or more coal mines. His heirs were surprised by the size of the distribution that they gained from his estate. ==Personal life and death== Waller first married Hannah Bradley on January 2, 1800. They had three children: Abraham Bradley (1800–1867), Nathan P. (1807–1884), and William Lindsey (1810–1887). Hannah Bradley died while the third child was still an infant. On March 31, 1814, Waller married Elizabeth Jewett, of New London, Connecticut. They had several more children: David Jewett (1815–1893), Harriet (1817–1887), Charles P. (1819–1862), George G. (1821–1888), and Martha (1825–1826). All three sons from this union would go on to become prominent figures. After the death of his wife in February 1859, Waller went to Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania to live with his son David Jewett. Phineas Waller died in Bloomsburg on June 3, 1859, at the age of 85. ==References== Category:People from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania Category:1774 births Category:1859 deaths Category:American postmasters Category:American landowners ","title":"Phineas Waller"},{"id":"46796936","text":"David Eric Edmunds is a British mathematician working in analysis.

The museum exhibits the old European art collections (dating between the 14th and 19th centuries) of the Finnish National Gallery. In addition, half of the museum acts as a historic house museum, displaying the 19th century estate of the Sinebrychoff family. ==History== Paul and Fanny Sinebrychoff, responsible for a large portion of the museum's collections The building housing the museum was constructed in 1842 by the Russian businessman Nikolai Sinebryukhov, whose brewery, Sinebrychoff, operated in the western side of the premises until 1992. Nikolai himself did not live in the house, staying instead in Suomenlinna. His brother's family lived in the house, and his nephew, Paul, began an art collection. Paul continued to collect European art after being appointed head of the company in 1904. Along with his actress wife, Fanny Sinebrychoff, he amassed a collection of about 900 items, mostly paintings (100 by the Old Masters and approximately 350 portrait miniatures), but also including antique furniture, silverware, and porcelain. In 1921, Paul and Fanny Sinebrychoff donated their collection to the Finnish government. It continues to be the largest art donation ever made in Finland. This was the same year that the house opened up as a historic house museum, showcasing 19th century upper class life. The donated art collection was not kept in the house, though it was returned in 1959 with funding from the Sinebrychoff company. In 1975, the Finnish government bought the entire building from the brewery, and, after restoration, opened the building as a museum in 1980. Collections featuring old European art were moved from Ateneum to the Sinebrychoff Art Museum. In 1990, the Sinebrychoff Art Museum was incorporated into the Valtion taidemuseo (National Art Museum). Following its disbandment in 2013, the Sinebrychoff Art Museum was incorporated into the newly formed Finnish National Gallery, in which it is one of three museums, the others being Ateneum and Kiasma. ==Collections== The collections of the Sinebrychoff Art Museum are composed primarily of old European paintings, primarily by the Old Masters.

Australia's largest basketball competition, the Australian Basketball Association (ABA), commenced in March with 116 teams competing across six states and territories (Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and ACT) culminating in the National Finals in September in Newcastle. In a weekend of top-level basketball, the Geelong Supercats and Ballarat Miners were triumphant in the men's and women's finals. The 2006 ABA National Finals were hosted by Newcastle Basketball Association and Basketball New South Wales. ==Tournament overview== The Geelong Supercats were back on top in 2006 with a comprehensive 94–80 triumph over the Dandenong Rangers in the men's Grand Final. Mark Leader's team played with a purpose, order and discipline that simply left their rivals with few solutions. The men from Dandenong looked in serious trouble down 53–40 at the half. However, the Rangers put their troubled zone defence away to start the second half and their shooters found some touch, in particular Grand Final MVP Ash Cannan (21 points & 19 rebounds). But so did Geelong's, and the teams simply traded baskets in the brightest scoring period of the game. Powerful offensive rebounding allowed Dandenong to hang on by a thread but try as they might the Rangers could not sufficiently upset the Supercats. At the final siren, the game's most controlled side relaxed their guard completely and the scenes of celebration were unrestrained. Jamal Brown top scored for the Supercats with 21 points, closely followed by Jason Reardon with 20 points. The Ballarat Miners showed superb composure to claim back-to-back ABA National titles in 2006. They patiently whittled away at an 11-point Bendigo lead to grind out a 69–66 win. Ballarat centre Karen Ashby (24 points, 15 rebounds & 7 assists) was awarded the Grand Final MVP, with a measured performance, showing great poise throughout the game as Bendigo constantly double-teamed her. The Miners were sharp in their execution, getting consecutive baskets from a flex offence. Bendigo threw everything at Ballarat in the dying stages but the Miners hung on for the win and the title. ==Participants== To qualify for the event, teams had to be crowned Champion of their respective Leagues. There were also a number of wildcard entries. ===League champions=== {  - bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\"  League  Men  Women -  Big V  Dandenong Rangers  Sandringham Sabres -  CABL  Forestville Eagles  Sturt Sabres -  QABL  Southern Districts Spartans  Southern Districts Spartans -  SEABL  Knox Raiders (South) & Geelong Supercats (East)  Bendigo Braves -  Waratah  Sutherland Sharks  Bankstown Bruins - } ===Wildcards=== {  - bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\"  League  Men  Women -  Big V  Sandringham Sabres  Dandenong Rangers -  CABL   -  QABL   -  SEABL   Ballarat Miners -  Waratah  Newcastle Hunters  Sydney Comets - } ==ResultsQuarter-finals – men=Quarter-finals – women=Classification Games – men=Classification Games – women=Semi-finals – men=Semi-finals – women=Grand Finals=All-Star FiveMen=== *Grand Final MVP: Ash Cannan (Dandenong Rangers) {  - bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\"  Name  Team -  Cameron Tovey  Sutherland Sharks -  Lester Strong  Dandenong Rangers -  C.

It is in the subgenus Pelargonium along with Pelargonium graveolens and Pelargonium capitatum and Pelargonium tomentosum. ==Description== Pelargonium crispum in cultivation. Botanical illustration of Pelargonium crispum, showing the small, crisped leaves arranged in two opposite rows along the stems. Pelargonium crispum is quite a large, shrubby, branching species, growing up to 70 cm tall. The leaves are usually arranged along the stems in two opposite rows (distichous arrangement). The leaves are small (10mm diameter), green, lemon-scented, fan- shaped, and have distinctively crisped (crinkled or wavy) edges. The small (25 x 5-8mm), white-to-pink flowers appear in Spring to Summer, in small groups or alone, on short pedicels.Pelargonium crispum - SANBI pagehttps://www.operationwildflower.org.za/index.php/albums/pelargoniums/pelargonium- crispum-thabo-8-3315 ===Eponymy=== \\"Pelargonium\\" comes from the Greek (\\"pelargos\\" which means \\"Stork\\", and another name for pelargoniums is \\"storksbills\\" due to the shape of their fruit). \\"Crispum\\" refers to the crisped, crinkled leaf-margins. ==Cultivars and hybrids== A variegated cultivar of Pelargonium crispum in cultivation. There are many cultivars and hybrids of Pelargonium crispum as it hybridizes readily with other species in the Pelargonium subgenus. These cultivars and hybrids include: * Pelargonium × nervosum - A lime scented hybrid between P. crispum and another species (possibly P. principissae according to Robert Sweet (botanist)). P. × nervosum is slightly hairy and has deep pink flowers. A variety of P. × nervosum is P. × torrento or 'Cola Bottles'. This variety has a slight ginger or cola smell as well as citrus. * Pelargonium × melissinum - The lemon balm pelargonium (lemon balm - Melissa officinalis). This is a hybrid between P. crispum and Pelargonium graveolens. * Pelargonium × citriodorum (synonym - 'Prince of Orange') - An orange scented pelargonium. A hybrid between P. crispum and P. × limoneum with small pale pink flowers. * Pelargonium crispum 'Cy's Sunburst' - A small, compact variety owith small variegated yellow leaves and pink flowers. It has a very strong lemon scent. P. Cy's Sunburst was bred the American plantsman; Cyrus Hyde and appears on his nursery website catalogue.http://www.wellsweep.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/WSHF- Catalog-2016.pdf * Pelargonium crispum 'variegatum' (synonym - 'Prince Rupert') - A variety of with variegated silvery leaves. * Pelargonium crispum 'Peaches and Cream' - A variety of with distinctly peach scented leaves. * Pelargonium 'Poquita' - Grapefruit scented variety of the P. × nervosum hybrid. * Pelargonium × limoneum - A hybrid with uncertain parentage but crispum is almost certainly one parent plant. It has small toothed leaves and quite large magenta flowers. It has a lemon/lime/rose/strawberry/cinnamon scent; different people detect different smells but it certainly has a citrus smell. * Pelargonium 'Lady Scarborough' - A very popular cultivar that smells of ripe strawberries. It has leaves very similar P. × limoneum with pale pink flowers and red veining in the leaves occurs as the leaves age. Presumed to be in the crispum group but this is not certain. Arthur Tucker says it is similar to P. englerianum. Note: Most Angel Pelargoniums are crosses between a regal pelargonium and Pelargonium crispum. ==Distribution and habitat== This species occurs in the Western Cape Province, South Africa, between Worcester in the north, and Bredasdorp in the south, as well as eastwards into the Little Karoo region. It occurs in rocky, sandy soil on lower slopes, in arid proteoid fynbos as well as renosterveld vegetation.http://pza.sanbi.org/pelargonium- crispum ==Uses== As well as being a houseplant or outdoor perennial depending on climate, Pelargonium crispum has a couple of other uses. Firstly, the leaves are edible and are used in salads or for flavouring cakes and stir- fries. Secondly, the leaves are very aromatic and can be used in something like potpourri. ==ReferencesExternal links== crispum Category:Renosterveld ","title":"Pelargonium crispum"},{"id":"46797235","text":"Kurt Cutkelvin (born 2 January 1964) is a Belizean former cyclist.

The Modrow government refers to the final socialist government of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), which was led by Socialist Unity Party (SED) official Hans Modrow from November 1989 until East Germany's first democratically elected government took power on 18 March 1990. == Background == > Further information: Die Wende Spurred on by the liberal policies of Glasnost and Perestroika in the Soviet Union, and Mikhail Gorbachev's apparent tolerance of liberal reforms in other countries in the Warsaw Pact, protests began to spread in the German Democratic Republic in 1989. This culminated in a large increase in citizens escaping from the country during the summer of 1989 after Hungary dismantled its portion of the Iron Curtain. At the same time opposition to the incumbent SED was growing - on 9 October 1989, for example, 70,000 people took part in a demonstration in Leipzig calling for free elections and other democratic rights which had been denied to East German citizens since the founding of the GDR. On 18 October 1989 Erich Honecker was ousted as leader by his Politburo as a result of his unwillingness to confront the societal problems which had led to the mass exodus and political protest. The relatively youthful Egon Krenz who was chosen as successor proved to be ineffective, and on 9 November 1989 the Berlin Wall was opened, becoming a symbol of the SED's complete loss of power. Within the first four days of the Wall's opening, 4.3 million people or 25% of the East German population had made the trip across the border to West Germany with many choosing to remain there to take advantage of the higher quality of life. Since 8 November a new Politburo had been in power when the previous one had unanimously resigned. Amongst the new members was former First Secretary of the SED in Dresden Hans Modrow. Despite the personnel change the new government was unable to bring stability to the situation, with increased absenteeism through emigration and citizens taking trips to West Germany placing higher pressure on the East German economy. == Formation  Round Table == As a result of the increasingly fragmented nature of the East German political landscape == Government of National Responsibility  Ministers == * Acting Foreign Secretary: Harry Ott * Chairman of the National Defence Council (and therefore Head of State): Egon Krenz (until 6 December 1989), thereafter Manfred Gerlach * Chairman of the State Planning Commission: Gerhard SchürerChilds p.103 * Deputy Chairpersons: Christa Luft, Lothar de Maizière and Peter Moreth * General of the People's Police: Lothar Arendt * Head of the Office for National Security: Wolfgang Schwanitz * Minister for Economic Questions: Christa Luft * Minister for Work and Wages: Hannelore Mensch * Ministers Without Portfolio: Wolfgang Ullmann, Rainer Eppelmann, Sebastian Pflugbeil, Gerd Poppe, Walter Romberg, Tatjana Böhm, Klaus Schlüter and Matthias Platzeck * Secretary of State: Wolfgang Rauchfuß == See also == * Die Wende * German Reunification == References == Category:Government of East Germany Category:1989 establishments in East Germany Category:1990 disestablishments in East Germany Category:Historic German cabinets ","title":"Modrow government"},{"id":"46797258","text":"Merlyn Dawson (born 5 April 1960) is a Belizean former cyclist.

The minerals extracted consisted of iron, gold, diamond, and bauxite. Guinea ranks first in the world in bauxite reserves and 6th in the extraction of high-grade bauxite, the aluminium ore. The mining industry and exports of mining products accounted for 17% of Guinea’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010. Mining accounts for over 50% of its exports. The country accounts for 94% of Africa’s mining production of bauxite. The large mineral reserve, which has mostly remained untapped, is of immense interest for international firms. In recent years, the mining industry in Guinea has suffered from controversy, specifically with respect to the iron ore mining industry and the block of mines in Northern Guinea. ==History== The mining tradition of Guinea is ancient and can be traced to a period before the Middle Ages, when gold and salt were trading commodities between Guinea and Ghana. Following the independence of Guinea from colonial rule, the economy of the country was largely dependent on the mining industry, in spite of political turmoil racking the country since 2011. The 1986 Mining Code was revised in 1995. In September 2011 the Mining Code was reviewed once more and a new code implemented that took effect in 2012. Changes to the code included increases in state ownership in joint ventures from 15% to 35%. ==Production and impact== Guinea's bauxite reserve is 7.4 billion metric tons, which is 26.4 percent of global reserves. High-grade iron ore reserves account for more than 4 billion tonnes. Diamond and gold deposits, as well as uranium, have also been reported. The mineral industry has provided job opportunities to 10,000 people. In the export sector, mining has contributed to as much as 90% of earnings from foreign exchange. Guinea now ranks sixth globally in the production of bauxite. Despite holding large mineral resources, Guinea, with 9,000,000 people, has a low income level, with the average wage less than one dollar a day. There are two dozen international companies associated with mining operations in Guinea. The domestic agencies involved with mining are the Association pour la recherche et l'Exploitation du Diamant et de l'Or, Friguia Sal, Siguri Gold, and Société AMIG Mining International SARL. ==Commodities== Minerals extracted in the country by private-public joint enterprises in collaboration with the Government of Guinea include bauxite, iron ore, and diamonds. Other resources mined are cement, gold, salt, graphite, limestone, manganese, nickel, and uranium. A major developer in the field of bauxite mining is the Alumina Company of Guinea (ACG-Fria), which is located in Fria; the government of Guinea holds a 49% share while the Reynolds Metals Company holds the 51% balance in this enterprise. Another partner in bauxite mining is (CBG). It is a joint venture of Alcoa, Rio Tinto, and Dado Mining holding a 51% share, and the Guinean government holding a 49% share. Its exports of bauxite are the largest in the world, reportedly in excess of 13.5 million tonnes in 2008. Guinea has large reserves of iron ore with high potential for extraction. These largely remains untapped, and its quality grade is more than 60%. Rio Tinto's joint sector enterprise in the iron ore sector is the Simandou mine project, with a value estimated at $6 billion. In 2012, Simandou mine was projected to produce 90 million tons of iron ore annually. The Mount Nimba mine, also in the iron ore sector, is located in the Nzérékoré Region, while the Kalia mine is in the Faranah Region. Diamond potential is estimated at 40 million carats. In 2012, production was 266,800 carats as per the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, and it is listed as the 13th-largest producer. A large number of gold mines are located in northeastern Guinea; the estimated production in 2011 was 15,695 kilograms. One of the country's largest gold mines is the Lefa mine in the Faranah Region. The Kalia Mine is owned by Bellzone Mining. == Controversies and corruption in the mining industry == In 2008, the government revoked the Rio Tinto licence for the Simandou mine, awarding it instead to BSGR, a company associated with Beny Steinmetz. After the election of President Alpha Condé in 2010, investigations were launched into several allegations of corruption within the mining industry and the government of Guinea expropriated BSGR's rights to mine at Simandou. But in November 2016, Rio Tinto came under fire for alleged corruption, involving a $10.5 million bribe paid to an aide and close advisor of President Condé to influence him to give the Simandou licence back to Rio Tinto. Rio Tinto admitted making the payment and fired two senior executives. In February 2019, President Condé and BSGR reached an agreement to withdraw the mutual allegations of corruption. The agreement had BSGR relinquish its rights to Simandou and to the smaller Zogota deposit while allowing Niron Metals head Mick Davis to develop Zogota. There have been further corruption allegations levelled at President Condé’s government involving bribery from the U.S. hedge fund Och-Ziff. In August 2016, Samuel Mebiame, who worked for the company, was arrested and charged in the U.S. with bribing Guinean and other African officials on behalf of Och Ziff to receive mining rights and access to secret information. According to the U.S. prosecutors, Mebiame was also part of a conspiracy to form a Guinean state- owned mining company and was involved in rewriting Guinea’s mining code. Mebiame pleaded guilty to conspiring to make corrupt payments to African members of government in December 2016. In 2017, Och-Ziff Capital Management Group came under investigation for several instances of bribery in the Guinean mining industry as well as widespread bribery across Africa. In September, a unit of Och-Ziff pled guilty to engaging in a multi-year bribery scheme; the judgement handed down included regulatory sanctions against Och-Ziff founder Daniel Och. In 2018, Michael Cohen, head of Och-Ziff European operations, was charged with ten counts of fraud. This followed a lengthy investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In September 2015, an investigation was launched into Mohamed Alpha Condé, the President's son. The French Financial Public Prosecutor charged him with embezzling public funds and receiving benefits from French firms that are involved in the Guinean mining industry. Another case of alleged corruption in the country’s mining industry is based on the findings of an NGO called Global Witness. According to their report Sable Mining, an AIM-listed company, got close to President Condé prior to the elections and bribed his son in order to receive iron ore mining rights to the Mount Nimba mine. These allegations have been under investigation by Guinean authorities since March 2016. ==See alsoReferencesBibliography== * * Category:Mining in Guinea Category:Economy of Guinea Guinea ","title":"Mining industry of Guinea"},{"id":"46797313","text":"Ahmed Al-Saleh (born 1966) is a Saudi Arabian former cyclist.

He was Minister of Posts and Telecommunications in 1960–62 and Minister of Industry in 1962–66. He was a Senator from 1968 to 1995. ==Early years== Michel Maurice-Bokanowski was born on 6 November 1912 in Paris, the son of the politician Maurice Bokanowski (1879–1928). His mother was Marguerite Wolff (born 1886), who married Maurice Bokanowski on 14 April 1908. He had an elder brother, Jean-Jacques Bokanowski, who became an advocate at the Court of Appeal of Paris. Michel attended the Lycée Condorcet. His father was killed on 2 September 1928 in an air accident when flying from Toul to an aviation meeting in Clermont-Ferrand. Michel was authorized to take the name \\"Maurice-Bokanowski\\" by a decree of 30 August 1928. Maurice-Bokanowski married Hélène Kann on 16 March 1938. They had one son, Thierry Maurice- Bokanowski. During World War II (1939–45) Michel Maurice-Bokanowski belonged to the Free French forces. He was made Commander of the Legion of Honour, Croix de Guerre 1939–45 and Compagnon de la Libération. After the war he was a fervent Gaullist. He was secretary-general of the Rassemblement du Peuple Français (RPF) for the Paris region from 1948 to 1951. ==Deputy and minister== Maurice-Bokanowski was elected a deputy in 1951. He was reelected a deputy for the 37th constituency of the Seine (Asnières-Bois-Colombes) in November 1958. He was Secretary of State for the Interior from 20 January 1959 to 4 February 1960 in the cabinet of Michel Debré, leaving his seat to his deputy Jacques Sanglier. Maurice-Bokanowski was Minister of Posts and Telecommunications from 5 February 1960 to 14 April 1962. He was Minister of Industry from 15 April 1962 to 8 January 1966 in the cabinet of Georges Pompidou. He was reelected to the legislature in 1962, and was confirmed in his ministry, which he held until the next presidential election. His deputy Émile Tricon took his seat. ==Mayor and businessman== Maurice-Bokanowski was mayor of Asnières-sur-Seine in the northwestern suburbs of Paris from 1959 until 1994, and a director of various companies in the commune, including the Société industrielle de récupération métallurgique, the Compagnie française des fontes en coquille (CFCE), Klippan France SA and the Société Neiman. After leaving the legislature in 1966 he devoted his energy to the development of Asnières. Maurice-Bokanowski was president of the Spanish company Cofraes (1966), and administrator of the Compagnie des plastiques Cosmos (1967), the Société des eaux minérales d'Evian (1970) and SEIMA (1971). He was also director of the Société Boka-Nouveautés. ==Senator== Maurice-Bokanowski was elected to the Senate for Hauts-de-Seine on 22 September 1968, and was reelected on 25 September 1977 and 28 September 1986.

Maurice-Bokanowski was rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on defense appropriations allocated to capital expenditure during the reviews of the 1969 and 1970 finance bills, and of the Committee on Naval expenditures in 1974 and 1975. In 1976 he filed a bill to ban free newspapers. On 12 November 1974 Maurice- Bokanowski supported Interior Minister Michel Poniatowski, who had called the Communist Party of the party \\"fascist,\\" triggering a heated debate. He said that the Communists did not have the same concept of democracy as his party. He suggested that the qualifier \\"totalitarian\\" used by Hannah Arendt would be more precise. Maurice-Bokanowski was a strong supporter of nuclear deterrence, but wrote a book titled La défense : Avant la bombe (Defense: Before the bomb; 1985) in which he warned against abandoning conventional weapons. Several times between 1983 and 1986 he denounced the trade deficit with the USSR. He generally followed the voting instructions of his parliamentary group, and supported the measures of the right. ==Last years== Maurice-Bokanowski was reelected mayor of Asnières for a fifth time in 1989, but was defeated in an election in March 1994.

Kanan also appears as a disembodied voice in the film The Rise of Skywalker (2019), with Prinze reprising his role. Within the Star Wars narrative, Kanan is a Jedi Padawan who survived the Great Jedi Purge after his master, Depa Billaba, sacrificed herself to save him. From that point onwards, Kanan lived most of his life on the run, hiding from the Galactic Empire, before eventually meeting Hera Syndulla and joining the Ghost crew as its de facto leader. While initially trying to keep his Force abilities hidden from his comrades, he re- embraces his Jedi role after meeting Ezra Bridger, whom he begins training in the Jedi arts, while also attempting to complete his own training and become a Jedi Knight. Later, Kanan and his crew join the Rebel Alliance to assist them in their fight against the Empire. While Kanan ultimately sacrifcies himself to save his friends, his legacy lives on through their memories of him, as well as his and Hera's son, Jacen Syndulla. While reception of Star Wars Rebels has been mixed, Kanan's character is one element of the series met with largely positive feedback. He quickly became a favorite among fans, regularly placing in fan polls and Star Wars character ranking lists. ==Creation and developmentConcept=== Executive producer Dave Filoni describes the character as a \\"cowboy Jedi\\". Animation supervisor Keith Kellogg said: \\"He is a Jedi but he's not a Jedi in the traditional sense that we've had before on the show. He's a little more rough around the edges. He's kept his lightsaber locked away, so he hasn't used it in a long time.\\" After being blinded, Kanan has been compared to the Star Wars Legends character Rahm Kota from Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, another blinded Jedi, which led Pablo Hidalgo from the Lucasfilm story group to say on Twitter that both characters were inspired by Zatoichi. Filoni compared Kanan to Gandalf from Lord of the Rings. In regards to the character's death in the episode \\"Jedi Night\\" of the fourth season of Star Wars Rebels, Filoni felt this was a natural end to Kanan promising he will see Hera again before being blinded and said: \\"In that moment he's not bound as this material thing that the physicality of sight would be a limitation to him.\\" While sketching storyboards for Kanan's death, Filoni became reluctant to kill the character, but Prinze, who \\"was resolute about the fact that his character needed to die\\" since the beginning of the series, encouraged him to write the scene. ===Voice acting=== Kanan is voiced by Freddie Prinze Jr. in Star Wars Rebels, and by Michael Benyaer in the micro- series Lego Star Wars: Droid Tales. ==AppearancesAnimated series=== The Clone Wars A young Caleb Dume makes a cameo appearance in the episode \\"Old Friends Not Forgotten\\" of the final season of The Clone Wars, where he is shown as a hologram alongside his master, Depa Billaba, during a meeting with other Jedi. Rebels Kanan first appears in a short film released prior to the series, \\"The Machine in the Ghost\\", and his voice is heard in another one, \\"Entanglement\\". In the two-part series premiere \\"Spark of Rebellion\\", Kanan is introduced as the de facto leader of the crew of the Ghost, a Rebel starship, who mostly operate on their own and try to survive. Although he never finished his own Jedi training, Kanan sees great potential in young Ezra Bridger of Lothal, and decides to train him as his own Padawan. In the season 1 finale \\"Fire Across the Galaxy\\", Kanan, who was captured by the Empire, is rescued by Ezra. Kanan then fights and defeats the Grand Inquisitor, before he and the rest of the Ghost crew are invited into the Rebel Alliance, now that the Empire has become aware of the threat they represent. In \\"The Siege of Lothal\\", the two-part premiere of season 2, Kanan survives an encounter with Darth Vader, while in \\"The Lost Commanders\\", he initially finds it difficult to trust the clone trooper Captain Rex, because clones had murdered his master, Depa Bilaba, as well as most other Jedi, in obedience to Order 66. In \\"Shroud of Darkness\\", Kanan is promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight following a series of adventures in the Jedi Temple on Lothal. In \\"Twilight of the Apprentice\\", the two-part finale of season 2, Kanan travels with Ezra, Ahsoka Tano, and the astromech droid Chopper to the Sith world of Malachor in hopes of finding the knowledge they need to defeat the Sith. There, they encounter the former Sith Lord Maul, posing as a frail hermit, who has been left stranded on the planet for years. Though seemingly friendly at first, as he helps the three Jedi defeat a trio of Imperial Inquisitors, Maul ultimately betrays them and escapes after blinding Kanan with his lightsaber. In season 3, a Force-sensitive creature called the Bendu mentors Kanan in the ways of Force-sight. Kanan still participates in Rebel missions, with his mastery of the Force compensating for his blindness, but he takes a less active role in leadership. In the two-part episode \\"Ghosts of Geonosis\\", Kanan meets Saw Gerrera, the leader of an independent Rebel group, much like the Ghost crew prior to joining the Rebel Alliance. In \\"Trials of the Darksaber\\", Kanan trains Sabine Wren in lightsaber combat. Season 4 portrays Kanan and Hera as being in a relationship, and at some point they conceive a child together. However, Kanan soon dies in the episode \\"Jedi Night\\" while rescuing Hera from Imperial captivity. He regains his eyesight moments before being consumed in an explosion, after containing the blast long enough for Hera and the rest of their group to escape harm. Despite his death, Kanan makes minor appearances in most of the remaining episodes. In \\"Wolves and A Door\\", while passing through the hyper tunnel on Loth-wolves, the remaining Spectres see several illusions of Kanan and hear his voice, like many others, such as the Grand Inquisitor, Hera, Ezra, Ahsoka and Zeb. He appears later on in the same episode in Hera's imagination. She imagines him as a Force ghost comforting her. In the following episode, \\"A World Between Worlds\\", Kanan's voice is heard in the World Between Worlds by both Ezra and Ahsoka multiple times, until he finally appears through a portal. Ezra makes up his mind to save him and goes to the portal that depicts Kanan's final moments. Ahsoka stops Ezra from saving Kanan, because then they would all die and because he had found the moment when he was needed most and did what he had to do for everyone. Though reluctant to do so, Ezra ultimately lets the blast consume Kanan. The ending of the series finale \\"Family Reunion and Farewell\\", set after the Battle of Endor, shows both Kanan and Hera's young son Jacen Syndulla, and a mural on Lothal painted by Sabine, which depicts the Ghost crew, including Kanan. Forces of Destiny Kanan is briefly mentioned by Ezra in the episode \\"A Disarming Lesson\\". ===Film=== The Rise of Skywalker Kanan Jarrus (voiced again by Prinze) is heard in The Rise of Skywalker as one of the Jedi spirits who help Rey defeat Palpatine. He tells Rey that \\"In the heart of a Jedi lies their strength.\\" ===Novels=== On September 2, 2014, Del Rey Books published Star Wars: A New Dawn, a prequel novel telling the story of how Kanan and Hera met. ===Comics=== The comic-book Kanan ran for 12 issues and was published by Marvel Comics, the series is set during the events of the first season of Star Wars Rebels and focuses on Kanan Jarrus having flashbacks to his time as a Jedi Padawan (when he was known by his real name Caleb Dume). Two story arcs were produced each ran for six issues, the first arc The Last Padawan focused on flashbacks which happened at the same time as Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith showing where Kanan was when Order 66 happened and the clone troopers betrayed and killed most of the Jedi, including his Jedi Master Depa Billaba. While the second arc First Blood flashbacks focused on how Kanan was assigned under Depa Billaba's mentorship, as well as Kanan's first battle along clone-troopers, in the Clone Wars, where he made a friendship with a clone trooper, it features an appearance from Rae Sloane a character from the novel Star Wars: A New Dawn, as well as one from Fenn Rau a mandalorian character who would later appear in Star Wars Rebels. ===Lego === Lego Star Wars: Droid Tales Jarrus appears in the third episode of Lego Star Wars: Droid Tales. ===Video games=== Kanan Jarrus also appears as a playable character in certain Star Wars video games, as described below: First half of the series The following games depict Jarrus as he appeared when the series first began. * Jarrus is a premium character in the now-defunct game Star Wars Rebels: Recon Missions, released by Disney Mobile on iOS, Android and Windows Store, a side-scrolling, run-and-gun platform game.

The film is a parody of The Expendables and similar action movies. Thompson said it contained actual events he had witnessed in his career. The film was released on iTunes. ==Plot== At the beginning, Brian Thompson explains that the movie is his answer to the question \\"What's it like to work with Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Steven Seagal or Jean-Claude Van Damme?\\". By combining actual situations and traits of these movie stars, he created one fictional character, Vardell Düsseldorfer or VD. VD is an aged and retired action movie star, who is now a drug addict and alcoholic. After a session of training, VD is watching the TV show \\"Excess Hollywood\\" (a parody of Access Hollywood). Anchor Tara Gray talks about the return of VD to acting after some political initiatives and goldfish advertising. VD's work is commented on by his fans and colleagues Ralek Gracie, Martin Kove and Kevin Sorbo. VD is going to direct and star in a science fiction movie called \\"Hard Time on Mars\\", filmed in Uzbekistan. Infuriated by the mocking, VD shoots the TV. The shooting begins at \\"Kremlenski Studios 17\\". On Day 1 VD shoots a Lightsaber duel between himself and Sir Jeffrey, another aged actor who has had no roles for two years. VD doesn't understand what it means to lock the scene. Also, he intrudes into set decorating. Producer Burton advises the director's first assistant to speak with VD about genitals in order to confuse him and make him get back to work. VD then suggests adding new scenes in the screenplay, but they have no time for this. VD calls his cook, Louie. He cooks the meal that he is asked to, but VD doesn't like it and leaves the set. Sir Jeffrey asks Burton about the script, because it is full of cliches, and the producer says it cost $100,000. VD begins the second shooting day with cocaine and alcohol. He stuffs kielbasa in his pants so it looks like he has a big penis. On the set he tries to meditate and falls asleep. Then VD wants to choose a toy for his co-star Maria to hit him on the head. Among the props he finds a small missile, makes a certain association and leaves with Maria. In his trailer VD pretends to have sex with Maria, which the crew is able to hear via walkie talkie. On the thirteenth day Sir Jeffrey and VD are speaking about the movie's plot. Sir Jeffrey thinks sub-villain must be killed before main villain, but uses a metaphor which VD can't understand. It's VD's birthday, so the crew presents him with an exploding cake as a practical joke, and VD is enraged. He scares the crew with a toy shotgun and goes to his trailer with his assistant Sue. They fail to have sex because of to VD's impotence, which constantly worries him. On the twenty third day VD takes medicine and begins to shoot a fight scene. The stunt coordinator makes a choking grip, rendering VD unconscious. VD wets his pants and the crew have to change them. They find the kielbasa and see a red and blue eagle claw tattoo on VD's genitals. The crew discusses it. This discussion continues on TV, involving among others Patrick Warburton and Craig Kilborn. The medic wakes VD and he goes to trailer with three girls, one of which is his bodyguard's sister, and they pretend to have sex. Last day of shooting. They need three more days to wrap it up. Burton wants VD to come out of his trailer and sends his assistant Emily for him. VD agrees only if he can photograph Emily's breasts for his collection. She wants €6 thousand from Burton for this. Then the producer asks screenwriter to shorten the script, but he refuses. After arguing with Maria VD fires her. VD wants a flying scene, but Burton against it due to its cost. Then VD begins to break decorations and gets stuck in the fiberglass rock. He tells Sir Jeffrey film's budget is $10 million ($5 million is his fee), but the props are too cheap, so he no longer wants to release the movie. VD reveals Maria was fired at her own request. Sir Jeffrey wants out too. He and VD act as if they have also argued about VD's grandiloquence behavior and VD fires Sir Jeffrey. Burton agrees to shoot the flying scene. VD is lifted on cables. Suddenly he has a heart attack. The crew tries to save him. Sue hits his chest and he regains consciousness. Then VD and Sue run to the trailer. VD's impotence has disappeared. After VD's rehabilitation, he comes to the premiere of his own movie in Los Angeles. Burton says that there will be a sequel \\"Hardest Time on Mars\\" with Salma Hayek. The movie is a hit and grosses a huge box office. Sir Jeffrey has a new rehearsal. ==Cast== Also Tara Gray, Ralek Gracie, Martin Kove, Kevin Sorbo, Bruce Locke, Patrick Warburton and Craig Kilborn made cameo appearances. ==References* Category:2014 films Category:2010s parody films Category:American parody films Category:American films Category:2014 comedy films ","title":"The Extendables"},{"id":"46797608","text":"This is a list of matches of FC Shakhtar Donetsk in Europe. Shakhtar Donetsk participates in European competitions since 1976 representing the Soviet Union (Soviet Top League) and playing its first against Berliner FC Dynamo in the 1976–77 UEFA Cup. The Ukraine-based club represented the Soviet Union until the dissolution of the last in 1991. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Shakhtar represents its native country of Ukraine. Since 1997, however, the club continuously participates on annual basis with variable successes, while also taking part in UEFA Champions League competition since 2000. Shakhtar's first qualification to a group stage in a European competition took place in the 2000–01 UEFA Champions League, when Shakhtar Donetsk played against Arsenal, Lazio and Sparta Prague in Group B. While being a constant presence in Champions League group stages, Shakhtar have only reached UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League group stages twice (2005–06 and 2009–10). In 2009, Shakhtar Donetsk won the UEFA Cup over Werder Bremen in the final held in Istanbul, becoming the first team in the independent Ukraine to win a European trophy. In 2010–11, Shakhtar reached the quarter-finals of Champions League, being eliminated by Barcelona; this was the first time the team qualified for the knockout phase in the Champions League. In 2015–16, despite a poor display in the Champions League group stages, Shakhtar was able to qualify to the Europa League knock-out phases by finishing third place in the group; Shakhtar reached the semi-finals after knocking out Schalke 04, Anderlecht and Braga, but were eventually knocked out by title defenders Sevilla. == Tallies balance == FC Shakhtar Donetsk opponents highlighted in blue as shown on the map. {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" -

As a nurse-in-training, she often encountered racism from colleagues and patients. In 1958, Louise Da-Cocodia qualified as a Staff Registered Nurse, and began a nursing career spanning 31 years. In 1966 she was appointed as Assistant Superintendent of District Nurses, the first Black senior nursing officer in Manchester. Even as a manager she experienced racist remarks from colleagues; “Those black so and so’s coming here and giving us orders!”. These experiences of prejudice inspired Louise to dedicate herself to tackling race equality issues: “deep in my mind is my commitment to bridge the gap which has led to the blacks being treated as inferior.” Rude Awakening African-Caribbean Settlers in Manchester, An Account In the 1960s and 1970s she served on regional Race Relations Board committees (later known as the Commission for Racial Equality, handling complaints brought under new anti-discrimination laws such as the Race Relations Act 1965. In 1981 she helped transport victims of the Moss Side riot to hospital, and later sat on the Hytner inquiry panel investigating the causes of the unrest. In 1984 she published a paper in the International Journal of Social Psychiatry exploring the effects of racism in nursing. From 1984 she served three terms as Chair of the West Indian Organisation Co-ordinating Committee. Louise Da-Cocodia undertook a number of community voluntary roles, both at a grassroots community level where she was affectionately known as ‘Mrs D’; and at a more formal level by serving on a number of governing boards and committees including Manchester Health Authority; Voluntary Action Manchester; and Manchester Metropolitan University. She was also a lay inspector at the Crown Prosecution Service and a Justice of the Peace. In 1990 she was nominated to the Manchester Magistrates’ Bench where she served for 14 years. In 1999 she was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of Manchester. Louise Da-Cocodia strove to promote equality of opportunity for Manchester’s inner-city residents in housing, education and employment, stating that she was inspired by an aim “…to help young Black people understand that this is their home, this is the society they live in, and that they have a part to play in developing it. Young Black people need role models around, not necessarily high profile ones…\\".The Bright Star, Eulogy by Sarah Da-Cocodia; see also transcript of Louise Da-Cocodia’s speech West Indians in Manchester at Manchester Literary & Philosophical Society April 1996 in Manchester Memoirs, Volumes 134-135, Page 72 She co-founded and steered a number of community enterprise schemes including Cariocca Education Trust and Arawak Walton Housing Association. She was also a founder member of Moss Side and Hulme Women’s Action Forum; the Agency for Economic Development in Manchester. ==Awards== In 1989 she was awarded an honorary Master's degree by the Victoria University of Manchester for services to nursing and the community. In 1992 she received the Manchester Race Award for improving race relations in the city. In the 1992 Birthday Honours she was awarded the British Empire Medal for her contribution to Greater Manchester’s West Indians' Organisation's Co-ordinating Committee. In 2005 she received an MBE for services to the people of Manchester. ==Legacy== Louise Da-Cocodia’s legacy lives on through the community organisations she help found. In 2008 Carrioca Enterprises renamed its education arm ‘the Louise Da-Cocodia Education Trust’ and it continues to build on her efforts to improve schooling opportunities for young people in particularly those of Afro-Caribbean heritage. In 2011, to honour its founder member and first chair, Arawak Walton Housing Association named a new housing development in Trafford ‘Louise DaCocodia Court’. She was also an advisor on the Moss Side and Hulme Task Force, and a member of the General Synod of the Church of England and a lay canon. Da-Cocodia was shortlisted in 2015 for the WoManchester Statue. Although Emmeline Pankhurst was decisively selected, Da- Cocodia's anti-racism work was brought to the attention of a new generation. The statue now sits in St Peter's Square, Manchester. First in the Fight (authors Helen Antrobus and Andrew Simcock, published 2019 ISBN number 978-1-84547-252-8) dedicates a chapter to Louise Da-Cocodia along with the other nineteen women considered for the statue. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Louise Da-Cocodia Education Trust Category:1934 births Category:2008 deaths Category:People in health professions from Manchester Category:Anti- racism activists Category:Jamaican emigrants to the United Kingdom ","title":"Louise Da-Cocodia"},{"id":"46797616","text":"Pelargonium tomentosum, the peppermint-scented geranium, is a pelargonium species native to South Africa. It is in the subgenus Pelargonium along with Pelargonium graveolens, Pelargonium crispum and Pelargonium capitatum. ==Etymology== Pelargonium comes from the Greek; Pelargos which means stork. Another name for pelargoniums is storksbills due to the shape of their fruit. Tomentosum refers to the soft, furry, tomentose leaves. ==Description== Pelargonium tomentosum is a tall, spreading species which grows up to a metre wide and a metre high. It is a very soft, hairy plant with a strong mint scent (due to the menthone in the leaves) and small white flowers. The leaves are green-grey in colour with a wide, three-lobed shape. ==Cultivars and hybrids== There are an only a few cultivars and hybrids of Pelargonium tomentosum. These cultivars and hybrids include: * Pelargonium tomentosum 'Chocolate Peppermint' - A hybrid between P. tomentosum and Pelargonium 'Giant Oak' (A cultivar of Pelargonium quercifolium). P. Chocolate Peppermint is a tall species that spreads like P. tomentosum. It smells slightly of mint but the 'chocolate' refers to the brown blotches in the centre of the leaves which it gets from P. 'Giant Oak'. * Pelargonium 'Islington Peppermint' - A hybrid between P. tomentosum and Pelargonium 'Splendide'. A smaller pelargonium with fresh mint scented leaves and striking bicolour flowers of white and brown. It is an unusual hybrid because P. tomentosum is in the subgenus Pelargonium but P. 'Splendide' is a hybrid between Pelargonium ovale and Pelargonium tricolor which are both in the subgenus Camphylia. ==Uses== As well as being a houseplant or outdoor perennial depending on climate, Pelargonium tomentosum has a few other uses. Firstly, the leaves are edible and are great as a flavouring for cakes or tea. The leaves are not usually eaten due to the hairiness of the leaves being somewhat repulsive. Secondly, due to the astringent characteristics of the oils in its leaves, a poultice can be made to treat sprains or bruises. It is also works like mint for treating sore throats if the menthol is obtained correctly. Thirdly the leaves are very aromatic and can be used in potpourri. ==References== tomentosum ","title":"Pelargonium tomentosum"},{"id":"46797617","text":"François Sérvanin (born 20 September 1941) is a French former racing driver. ==References== Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:French racing drivers Category:24 Hours of Le Mans drivers ","title":"François Sérvanin"},{"id":"46797618","text":"Tickle-U is a defunct weekday morning preschool programming block that aired on Cartoon Network (and, for a brief time, on sister channel Boomerang), featuring domestic and foreign-imported series targeted at preschool-age children; it, like competitors Nick Jr. and Playhouse Disney, existed on account of Cartoon Network's primary audience of children and teenagers attending school during the block's airtime.

It was released as a single in France, backed by \\"Lonesome Suzie.\\" ==Lyrics and music== \\"Whispering Pines\\" is a ballad on the theme of loneliness. Manuel wrote the melody and vocal line but could not come up with the lyrics, so Robertson wrote the lyrics. According to Robertson, \\"Richard always had this very plaintive attitude in his voice, and sometimes just in his sensitivity as a person. I tried to follow that, to go with it and find it musically. We both felt very good about this song.\\" The lyrics are filled with images of loneliness such as a lonely foghorn, crashing waves and the titular whispering pines. Allmusic critic Bill Janovitz notes that pines are prevalent in Woodstock, New York, where the Band was living, and in Canada, where most of the group is originally from. According to music critic Barney Hoskyns, \\" the lyric that Robbie worked around Richard's vocal lines was one of the most beautiful he ever wrote, a song of intense loneliness set beside an ocean that seemed to symbolize the singer's endless sense of loss.\\" According to Band manager Joe Forno, Manuel had written the melody on a piano that had one key which was out of tune. He decided to tune the piano that was used for the recording the same way, and that provides the repeating piano figure at the beginning of the song. Despite the sad imagery, Hoskins hears resolution and peace in the music, and notes that the last words of the song state that \\"the lost are found.\\" Rolling Stone Magazine critic Greil Marcus also finds optimism in the song, but \\"only because it is so full of desire.\\" Janowitz finds some hope in the line \\"If only one star shines, that's enough to get inside.\\" Associated Press writer Mary Campbell described the song as stressing \\"the western of country-western,\\" which she described as \\"a very good idea.\\" ==Recording== \\"Whispering Pines\\" was one the last three songs recorded for The Band, along with \\"Up on Cripple Creek\\" and \\"Jemima Surrender.\\" Manuel sings the lead vocal and plays piano. As described by music critic Nick DeRiso, he reaches \\"for vocal places in an unguardedly heartbroken way.\\" Robertson has stated that \\"The hurt in his voice ... there's a certain element of pain in there, that you didn't know if he was trying to reach the note or he was just a guy with a heart that had been hurt.\\" Drummer Levon Helm joins him on the last verse in a call and response structure that music critic Barney Hoskyns calls \\"one of the saddest and loveliest passages of music in the history of rock.\\" Besides Manuel's \\"vulnerable\\" singing and \\"delicate\\" piano playing, Janovitz and Hoskins also praise Robertson's acoustic guitar playing, which Hoskins describes as \\"delicate\\" and Garth Hudson's Lowrey organ playing, which according to Hoskins provides \\"magical sounds.\\" Janovitz also explicitly praises Helm's drumming and Rick Danko's \\"thoughtful\\" bass. ==Reception== Janovitz describes \\"Whispering Pines\\" as \\"one of the Band's most beautiful songs, if not the most gorgeous.\\" Music critic Nick DeRiso says \\"it may be the most unbearably sad thing the Band ever did.\\" Billboard regarded the song as one of The Band's \\"most haunting ballads.\\" Author George Case likewise wrote that \\"Whispering Pines\\" is \\"one of the most haunting ballads in rock 'n' roll.\\" \\"Whispering Pines\\" has appeared on several of the Band's compilation albums. It appeared as one of the bonus tracks on the 1995 reissue of The Best of the Band.

Allmusic critic Gregory McIntosh described Williams' version as being \\"initially stunning,\\" with a \\"lovely\\" backing and new age influence, but criticized the impact of Cliff Eberhardt's guest vocal in the last verse.

He was elected to two terms in the Texas House of Representatives. In 1878, he was the first African American in Texas to run for statewide office, but was unsuccessful in his campaign for lieutenant governor. ==Early life== Born into slavery in Richmond, Virginia, in 1830, Allen was taken to Texas as a child when his master migrated there in 1837. While still enslaved, Allen gained a reputation as a skilled carpenter. ==Career== After emancipation following the American Civil War, Allen went into business as a contractor. He built a mansion for Joseph R. Morris, Mayor of Houston. He also built one of the first bridges across Buffalo Bayou. Allen first entered public service in 1867, working as an agent for the Freedmen's Bureau, a federal organization created to assist emancipated slaves. He joined the Republican Party. In 1868, he won a seat to represent Harris and Montgomery counties in the Texas Legislature, serving in the Twelfth Legislature in 1869. He was re-elected to the Thirteenth Texas Legislature, but the election was contested. The increasingly Democratic-dominated legislature seated his Democratic opponent, Gustave Cook, instead. Allen worked to improve public education and to establish state pensions for Civil War veterans. He served on the Texas House Roads and Bridges Committee. In 1870, Allen entered the race for the United States House of Representatives from his district, but withdrew his candidacy during the early part of the Republican nominating process. In his business life, that year Allen co-founded the Bayou City Bank in Houston. In 1872 he won a street paving contract with the City of Houston. In 1878 Allen unsuccessfully ran for lieutenant governor; he was the first African American in Texas to run as a candidate for a statewide office. After leaving the legislature, he continued to be active in the Republican Party. He attended state and national conventions as a delegate until 1896 (for more than two and a half decades). Allen also served as a quartermaster in the Texas militia. He received a federal appointment as a US customs officer in Houston during a Republican presidential administration. ==Personal life== Allen married and had five children. He was a Baptist, and was active in his church and in local community organizations. ==Death== Upon his death in 1909, Allen was interred at the Olivewood Cemetery in Houston. ==See also== *History of the African Americans in Houston ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Texas Legislators: Past & Present - Richard Allen * Forever Free: Nineteenth Century African- American Legislators and * Constitutional Convention Delegates of Texas, Texas State Library * Findagrave - Richard Allen Category:1830 births Category:1909 deaths Category:Members of the Texas House of Representatives Category:Texas Republicans Category:American freedmen Category:Politicians from Richmond, Virginia Category:African-American politicians during the Reconstruction Era Category:African-American state legislators in Texas Category:Politicians from Houston Category:Baptists from Texas ","title":"Richard Allen (Texas politician)"},{"id":"46797712","text":"The Counter-Revolution of Science: Studies on the Abuse of Reason is a 1952 book by Nobel laureate economist Friedrich Hayek, in which the author addresses the problem of scientism in the social sciences, where researchers and reporters attempt to apply the methods and claims of objective certainty from hard science, despite the fact that the latter attempts to eliminate the human factor from study and the \\"soft\\" sciences attempt to understand human action. == Synopsis == This book is divided into three parts. The first is a reworking of Hayek's essay, \\"Scientism and the Study of Society\\". The second is an analysis of the doctrine of Saint-Simon, essentially forming the foundation of scientism and the movement to silence objection to its assertions. Hayek lifts the title of the compiled book, The Counter-Revolution of Science, from Saint-Simon, who essentially asserted that the relative freedom of expression and thought of the Revolution in France was no longer necessary, that using the force of law to impose \\"scientific\\" conclusions on everyone was now necessary. The last segment examines Comte and Hegel, and their similar takes on the philosophy of history. The first two sections were both originally published in the peer-reviewed magazine Economica, in the early 1940s. Hayek observes that the hard sciences attempt to remove the \\"human factor\\" in order to obtain objective, strictly controlled results: Meanwhile, the soft sciences are attempting to measure human action itself: He notes that these are mutually exclusive: Social sciences should not attempt to impose positivist methodology, nor to claim objective or definite results: This book was lauded by Hayek's own mentor, Ludwig von Mises, for its analysis of the topic. == Publishing history == Parts of this book were published in Economica Magazine in the early 1940s. The book itself was compiled and printed in 1952. It eventually fell out of print, but was re-published in the US in 1980, and remained available since. ==Reception== Czech Neo-Marxist Karel Kosík in his book Dialectics of the Concrete (1976) criticizes the following passage of the book: \\"The object of scientific inquiry is never the totality of all observable phenomena in a given time and space, but always only certain aspects of it ... The human spirit can never encompass the 'whole' in the sense of all different aspects of the real situation\\". Kosík believes Hayek wrote it in a polemic against Marxist concept of totality, and clarifies that, \\"Totality indeed does not signify all facts. Totality signifies reality as structured dialectical whole, within which any particular fact (or any group or set of facts) can be rationally comprehended\\" as \\"the cognition of a fact or of a set of facts is the cognition of their place in the totality of reality.\\" He considers Hayek's theory to be part of the atomist–rationalist philosophical thinking of reality, declaring \\"Opinions as to whether cognition of all facts is knowable or not are based on the rationalist–empiricist idea that cognition proceeds by the analytic–summative method. This idea is in turn based on the atomist idea of reality as a sum of things, processes and facts\\". Kosík claims that Hayek and those philosophers (including Karl Popper on The Poverty of Historicism and Ferdinand Gonseth of Dialectica) lack the understanding of the dialectical process of forming the totality.

It was finished on 11 February 1923 and published on 29 March 1923, originally by the LEF magazine. The poem's first separate edition was illustrated by Alexander Rodchenko who in his montages used photographs made by Mayakovsky and Lilya Brik. ==History == In summer 1922 Lilya Brik fell in love with Alexander Krasnoshchyokov, the then head of the newly formed Prombank. Mayakovsky was outraged, a quarrel ensued and the terms of the two-month separation have been agreed between the two. As a result, the poet departed to his 'boat-room' at the Lybyansky Lane, 3/6, \\"banned\\" from visiting the Briks at their Vodopyany Lane home. There, working for 16-20 hours a day, he wrote About That. On 11 February it was finished. \\"That was arguably my best poem in terms of the editorial work done upon it,\\" he later wrote in a preface to the compilation This Year's Things.Makarov, V., Zakharov, A., Kosovan, I. Commentaries to About That. The Works by Vladimir Mayakovsky in 6 volumes. Ogonyok Library. Pravda Publishers. Moscow, 1973. Vol.II, pp. 568-569 There was an entry in Mayakovsky's diary, commenting upon the reasons of his self-imposed exile: \\"Here I sit alone, but only because I am willing to. Have to think my life over, and myself… Does love mean everything to me? Yes, but in a peculiar sort of way. Love is life, it is the most important of things. That is what verses roll out of, not to speak of other things. Love is the heart of everything. Once it stops beating, everything else dies, becomes superfluous, unnecessary...\\" On 28 February 1923 Mayakovsky and Lilya Brik met again and went for several days to Petrograd together. In her 1956 book of memoirs Brik remembered: > I came to the railway station and found him on the platform, waiting for me > on the wagon steps. As the train started, Volodya, leaning on the door read > me the poem About That. Having finished, he burst into tears, immensely > relieved. Now, in the course of those two months I often had pangs of > consciousness. Volodya was suffering there alone, while I lived an ordinary > life, was seeing people, visiting places. Now I felt happy. For the poem > that I've just heard wouldn't have been written should I have not chosen > Volodya as my personal ideal and an impersonation of an ideal human being.\\" On 29 March 1923 the No.3 issue of LEF came out in which the poem was published. On 3 April 1923, speaking at a Proletkult meeting, Mayakovsky made an attempt to define the poem's main idea which, apparently, remained unclear to many of his colleagues. \\"Here everybody said how impossible it is to capture this poem's leitmotif. What you've heard were only fragments, but even from them the leitmotif is clear: it's the everyday life routines. Which haven't changed, and are still our worst enemy, making the philistines out of us.\\" After the poem has been finished, the two-month break in Brik-Mayakovsky relations came to an end, but the damage done proved to be irrevocable. \\"Now I am free from placards and love,\\" Mayakovsky confessed in his poem \\"For the Jubilee\\" (1924). Before that Lilya told him she was no longer in love with him, adding: \\"I think you too love me lesser now and won't be suffering too much.\\" And yet the Briks and Mayakovsky never parted, he continued to support the couple financially and in 1926, when Mayakovsky was granted a state-owned flat at the Gendrikov Lane in Moscow, all three of them moved in and lived there until 1930. ==Reception== Anatoly Lunacharsky (left) was immensely impressed by About That, according to his wife, actress Natalya Rosenel (right) The poem proved to be unpopular with the LEF community. \\"What a well of sensitivity this 'novel' is… No doubt schoolgirls will soak it with tears. But we in 1923 have no interest for such things whatsoever,\\" wrote the LEFs co-editor Nikolai Chuzhak-Nasimovich. On the other hand, it made an extraordinary impression upon Anatoly Lunacharsky. In the early March 1923 Mayakovsky for the first time read the poem in public, in the Briks' home, at the Vodopyany Lane. Among those present were Lunacharsky with his wife, actress Natalya Rosenel, Nikolai Aseyev, David Shterenberg, Alexander Rodchenko, Boris Pasternak. Natalya Lunacharskaya-Rosenel remembered: > Anatoly Vasilyevich has always admired Mayakovsky the performer, but this > time Vladimir Vladimirovich was under some particular inspiration. The > impression he made was striking, most profound. Anatoly Vasilyevich has been > completely captured both by the poem and the rendition… 'I always knew that, > but now I've got the proof.

The Memory of the Heart // Память сердца. > Moscow, 1975. Pp. 24—25. In summer 1923, in Siberia Lunacharsky was still speaking of Mayakovsky's poem with the greatest enthusiasm, praising it as \\"the huge phenomena.\\" \\"What struck me was that Anatoly Vasilyevich quoted several fragments of it by heart, without having a written copy, having heard the poem just once… As the poem came out as a separate book, he recited it in full to a group of close friends.

Thus, people in lower or upper classes can also possess middle-class values, they are not exclusive to people who are actually middle-class. Contemporary politicians in Western countries frequently refer to such values, and to the middle-class families that uphold them, as worthy of political support. == Contrasts == Middle-class values can be contrasted with other values that may be held by other people belonging to other classes and historical time periods, such as: * Tribal thinking or clannishness * Contentment with a low material standard of living * Valorisation of strength and petty violence * Anti-intellectualism * Criminality * A life of easy leisure and being served by servants (a value often exhibited by the upper classes), as opposed to hard work * Bohemian values - rejecting middle class materialism, embracing artistic creation * Religious fundamentalism (various types) - rejecting earthly goals (illusions) and/or disdaining middle class empiricism and material desires * Contrarianism - rejecting various aspects of middle class life and values * Revolutionary - aiming through political or cultural means to overturn or destroy the existing societal order, replacing it with a different and superior system * Utopianism - striving to design and/or create a perfect or ideal society (in practice, as a small community within a larger state) * Absurdism - rejecting given values systems and seeking to understand the true value and meaning of life, while accepting that such understanding is impossible == History  Spread of middle-class values === British economic historian Gregory Clark has controversially claimed, in his book A Farewell to Alms, on the basis of extensive research, that Britain may have been where the Industrial Revolution began because the British people had a head start in \\"evolving\\"through a combination of cultural and possibly even genetic changesa critical mass of people with middle-class values. Others have claimed, by contrast, that the \\"natural inclination\\" of workers at the early stages of the Industrial Revolution was to work as few hours as needed to earn a subsistence living, and workers had to be brainwashed into working long hours. Some have claimed that compulsory education and advertising played a part in this brainwashing - compulsory education instilling obedience and hard work at an early age, and advertising instilling desire for consumer goods that had to be paid for with more work. In A Farewell to Alms Clark disputes such explanations, citing persistent large differences in labour productivity in India and Britain, even when British managers and identical machines to those used in Britain were used, and even though both countries have compulsory education for children. == Mechanism of transmission == Since the middle class is the dominant class in western modernity (specifically after the industrial revolution), middle-class values hold cultural capital and hegemony over western modernial cultures. Middle class values are thus imposed upon an entire population through economic and cultural means. That is, those living within the bounds of western modernity must conform to middle-class expectations in order to gain access to wealth or cultural legibility. Middle-class values, or the lack thereof, are transmitted from parents to children, by schools, by employers, and by mainstream media, such as the quintessentially middle-class newspaper The Daily Mail. According to Gregory Clark, it is possible that there is also a substantial genetic component, and this is why social mobility is so low across societies and across history, as he establishes in his book The Son Also Rises. However, this view is highly problematic, ethnocentric, and eurocentric as it naturalizes and self-validates middle-class dominance. == Criticism  See also == * Protestant work ethic * Achievement ideology * Laziness == References == * Clark, Gregory.

Contested over 405 laps – extended by five laps due to a green-white-checkered finish – on the 1 mile (1.6 km) concrete speedway, it was the 13th race of the 2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season. Jimmie Johnson won the race, his fourth win of the season and tenth at Dover, while Kevin Harvick finished second and Kyle Larson finished third. Kasey Kahne and Aric Almirola rounded out the top five. Denny Hamlin scored the pole for the race and led 118 laps on his way to a 21st-place finish after being caught up in a late race wreck. Martin Truex, Jr. led the most laps for the third consecutive race on his way to a sixth- place finish. The race had 15 lead changes among nine different drivers, as well as seven caution flag periods for 40 laps. This was the 74th career victory for Jimmie Johnson, tenth at Dover International Speedway – becoming the fifth driver to win ten or more races at one race track – and 18th at the track for Hendrick Motorsports. This win moved Jimmie Johnson up to third in the points standings. Chevrolet left Dover with a 51-point lead over Ford in the manufacturer standings. The FedEx 400 benefiting Autism Speaks was carried by Fox Sports on the cable/satellite Fox Sports 1 network for the American television audience. The radio broadcast for the race was carried by the Motor Racing Network and Sirius XM NASCAR Radio. ==ReportBackground=== Dover International Speedway (formerly Dover Downs International Speedway) is a race track in Dover, Delaware, United States. Since opening in 1969, it has held at least two NASCAR races. In addition to NASCAR, the track also hosted USAC and the Verizon IndyCar Series. The track features one layout, a concrete oval, with 24° banking in the turns and 9° banking on the straights. The speedway is owned and operated by Dover Motorsports. The track, nicknamed \\"The Monster Mile\\", was built in 1969 by Melvin Joseph of Melvin L. Joseph Construction Company, Inc., with an asphalt surface, but was replaced with concrete in 1995. Six years later in 2001, the track's capacity moved to 135,000 seats, making the track have the largest capacity of sports venue in the mid- Atlantic. In 2002, the name changed to Dover International Speedway from Dover Downs International Speedway after Dover Downs Gaming and Entertainment split, making Dover Motorsports. From 2007 to 2009, the speedway worked on an improvement project called \\"The Monster Makeover\\", which expanded facilities at the track and beautified the track. After the 2014 season, the track's capacity was reduced to 95,500 seats. Kevin Harvick entered Dover with a 41-point lead over Martin Truex Jr.. Joey Logano entered 66 back. Joey Logano entered 62 back. Dale Earnhardt Jr. entered 72 back. Jimmie Johnson entered 80 back. Tires Goodyear provided teams with a newly constructed left-side tire compound intended to provide more grip. Teams were also given nine sets of tires for the race instead of the normal eleven. Penalties from Charlotte Following two consecutive weeks of failing to pass qualifying tech inspection on the first attempt, the No. 48 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet and the No. 51 HScott Motorsports Chevrolet teams were to be relegated to having the last pit stall selections after the completion of qualifying. The 48 team, however, appealed the penalty and will pick in the order they qualify. Entry list The entry list for the FedEx 400 was released on Monday, May 25 at 12:41 p.m. Eastern time. Forty-five drivers were entered for the race. The only car with a different driver than the previous week's Coca-Cola 600 is Brian Scott. He returned to the seat of the No. 33 Hillman-Circle Sport LLC Chevrolet. {  {  style=\\"font- size:95%\\" - ! ! Driver ! Team !

By lap 20, he caught the tail end of the field and saw his lead begin to shrink to Martin Truex Jr. After being held up by Justin Allgaier, Hamlin lost the lead to Truex, Jr. on lap 45. By lap 60, Kevin Harvick began reeling in the leader. But Truex, Jr. started pulling away again. Debris in turn 1 brought out the first caution on lap 74. This was the longest green flag run to start a race in the 2015 season. Hamlin reclaimed the lead by exiting pit road first. Green flag run The race restarted on lap 80. For the first few laps, Truex, Jr. kept Hamlin from getting a big lead, but as the field caught the tail end of the field, Hamlin jumped to a bigger lead. Eventually, Truex, Jr. took back the lead on lap 145. The second round of pit stops began on lap 150 when Clint Bowyer hit pit road. Truex, Jr. surrendered the lead to pit on lap 158 and gave it to Hamlin. He pitted on lap 160 and handed the lead to teammate Carl Edwards. He pitted on lap 162 and handed the lead to Dale Earnhardt Jr. The second caution flew on lap 163 when Ricky Stenhouse Jr. had a tire blow out and slammed the wall in turn 2. David Gilliland was tagged for speeding on pit road during the green flag stops and was forced to serve a drive-through penalty. Edwards was tagged for taking equipment out of the pit box after the wrench used to adjust the track bar got stuck in the hole and restarted the race from the tail end of the field. Trouble on the front stretch Martin Truex Jr. leads the field on lap 186 The race restarted on lap 169 with Truex, Jr. in the lead. The third caution of the race flew on lap 176 for a 3-car wreck on the front stretch. This began when Trevor Bayne, while exiting turn 4, was moving up the track and got turned by Michael Annett. He overcorrected, turned down, and hit the inside wall. Annett continued to ride the wall before getting rear-ended by Allgaier. Annett continued on, but Allgaier did not. While Truex opted not to pit, most of the cars on the lead lap behind him did. ===Second half=== Halfway The race restarted on lap 185. The field got strung out until the next round of pit stops on lap 247. Truex, Jr. hit pit road on lap 248 and handed the lead to Kyle Busch. He made his stop on lap 251 and gave the lead to Hamlin. He served his stop on lap 258 and the lead cycled to Harvick. Edwards and Earnhardt Jr. were tagged for speeding on pit road and served drive-though penalties. Annett was tagged for an uncontrolled tire and served a drive-through penalty. The uncontrolled tire came to a rest at the outside pit wall and brought out the fourth caution of the race on lap 261. During this caution period, the concrete pit box that Tony Stewart occupied was beginning to come apart. Final round of pit stops The race restarted on lap 268 with Truex leading the way. Harvick took the lead the next lap. After ten laps, he pulled to a 1.8-second lead over the No. 78 car. Matt Kenseth was running fifth when he made an unscheduled stop on lap 307. He returned to the track the 22nd position, two laps down. The final round of green flag pit stops began on lap 325 when Kevin Harvick gave up the lead to pit and gave it to Kyle Busch, who pitted on lap 329 and gave the lead to Clint Bowyer. Then, Bowyer hit pit road and gave the lead to Brad Keselowski. Danica Patrick and Josh Wise were tagged for speeding on pit road and were forced to serve a drive-through penalty. 50 laps to go Jimmie Johnson, seen here at the 2015 Daytona 500, scored the 74th victory of his career at Dover International Speedway. Brad Keselowski made his final stop with 43 laps to go and the lead cycled to Kevin Harvick. The fifth caution of the race flew with 25 laps to go for a two car wreck. Going through turn 3, Kyle Busch tried to pass Brian Scott when both cars slid up the track and slammed the wall. \\"I guess Brian said his spotter didn't say anything, and he just chopped the corner,\\" Busch said. \\"I was under him already and it just sucked me around. I just hate it and I hate it for my guys. Man, we had a really good run going. Obviously, we ran in the top five all day long.\\" Harvick and Johnson opted to stay out while third place Martin Truex Jr. and the rest of the lead lap cars pitted. Carnage in the closing laps The race restarted with 17 laps to go. Jimmie Johnson jumped ahead of Harvick and took the lead. The sixth caution of the race flew with 15 laps to go for a second two car wreck on the backstretch. Exiting turn 2, Hamlin got tapped by Bowyer. He turned down and back up the banking and clipped Kurt Busch. The race restarted with ten laps to go. The seventh caution of the race flew with two laps to go for a third two car wreck in turn 4. The wreck collected A. J. Allmendinger and Casey Mears. Green-White-Checker The race restarted with two laps to go. Johnson shot ahead of teammate Kasey Kahne and held off Harvick to score his tenth career win at Dover. He became the fifth driver to have 10 or more wins at a single track. ===Post-race=== Post-race comments “God, just driving hard and working that track bar adjuster as much as I could,” Johnson said. “I was trying to be smart with my line and I guess guys on two tires weren’t all that fast. Chad (Knaus, crew chief) said something to be about that on the radio and they never really came, you know? The No. 4 (Harvick) and I did just fine on old tires and held those guys off. It was a long-fought day.” Aric Almirola scored his first top ten finish of the season with a fifth-place finish. “I am proud of (crew chief) Trent Owens and all the guys at Richard Petty Motorsports,” Almirola said. “They have been working their guts out trying to bring better cars to the race track week in and week out.” After leading the most laps for the third straight race, Martin Truex Jr. finished sixth. “We had a good car today but it was never right,” Truex Jr. said. “We were never right yesterday all through practice. We made some changes today and we made some gains on it, but never really got it where we needed it. Clean air was huge. When we were out front, we were okay. It just never turned good all day long. It eventually caught up to us.” Post-race penalties On the following Wednesday, NASCAR announced penalties stemming from Dover International Speedway that affect two race teams. The first is a personal conduct penalty that affects Trevor Bayne for exiting his wrecked car before he was cleared to do so by track safety officials. This violates sections 12.1, 12.8 b and 10.4.2.1 in the 2015 NASCAR rule book. He was fined $20,000 and placed on probation through the end of the calendar year. The No. 4 team was assessed a P1 level penalty for receiving written warnings in two consecutive events (Section 12.5.3.1b,c NASCAR rule book). The team received the last choice in the pit selection process for the following weekend's event at Pocono Raceway. Race results {  style=\\"font- size:95%\\" - ! Pos ! Grid ! ! Driver ! Team !

For many years a foreign correspondent of ABC News (US), one of the early producers of All Things Considered at NPR, National Public Radio, and later the editorial director for live events within the BusinessWeek Group of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Shuster has conducted over 5000 live interviews of management leaders before audiences of their business peers at corporate, industry, professional, and governmental policy and investment events around the world. ==Early life and education== Scott Shuster is a native of Greendale, Wisconsin. He received the first B.A. in Mass Communication from the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, and also studied Political Science (Latin America) at Marquette University. He later gained an MBA degree at Switzerland’s IMEDE/IMD, International Institute for Management Development, Lausanne, Switzerland. Scott has been a member of the adjunct faculty of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, and has spoken widely on the governance of journalism and communications, including a French-language tour of francophone African countries for the United States Information Agency. ==CareerRadio and Television=== Scott Shuster became a local radio newscaster in Milwaukee at age 16 while still in high school (radio stations WRIT-FM and WOKY). By 18 he was on television delivering the 11 o’clock news on Milwaukee’s WVTV-TV, and by age 24 he was the highest-rated local television news presenter in the US, at WTVT, the CBS affiliate in Tampa-St.Petersburg, Florida. Shuster’s popularity as an anchorman is attributed to the personable, conversational news presentation style he used at a time (1970s) when US local television news presentation was primarily serious, featuring none of the chit-chat among on-camera presenters that later became the norm. While at WTVT Scott Shuster wrote and delivered a report on a record-setting Led Zeppelin concert held in Tampa. Thirty-eight years later this report was featured as the opening scene of Led Zeppelin’s 2014 Celebration Day theatrical movie release. Noticed at WTVT-TV by Florida native Deborah Amos of National Public Radio, Shuster was invited to move to Washington and join NPR where he became one of the early producers of All Things Considered evening news magazine program. Shuster later joined the Washington-based Associated Press Radio Network, and the Africa Service of the Voice of America, before becoming the Geneva, Switzerland-based foreign correspondent of ABC News, first under ABC’s Paris Bureau Chief Pierre Salinger and later reporting directly to ABC Chief Foreign Correspondent Peter Jennings. For nine years with ABC Shuster worked in more than 40 developing countries covering mainly Africa, South and East Asia, and Latin America. In 1986, CNN Executive Producer Stuart Loory approached Scott Shuster for help with a new program he was planning, CNN World Report (today known as CNN World View). The program was to launch in 1987 and would feature news items produced by the (at that time largely government-owned) television broadcasters of a list of nations, eventually 150 countries. This content would be broadcast worldwide: On CNN in the US, on CNN International around the world, as well as on the government-owned broadcasting stations that contributed the material. Knowing of Shuster’s long experience as the guy in the Safari Suit reporting for ABC from the most distant lands, Loory asked Shuster to try to sign up government broadcasters in Africa in particular. Shuster visited and brought to CNN program contribution relationships with the television broadcasters of Senegal, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Zaire (today’s Democratic Republic of Congo), and with the government film unit of Sudan (where there was as yet, no television). ===Business Journalism and Live Events=== Returning to the US, Shuster moved to New York to join McGraw-Hill’s BusinessWeek magazine, then the world’s leading global business news weekly publication. He became the founding Editorial Director of McGraw-Hill's worldwide business event development organization, BusinessWeek Executive Programs. Reporting directly to company scion James H. McGraw IV, Shuster pioneered a new TV-talk-show style corporate meeting format. Eschewing the norm of slide-supported speeches by business executives, which he viewed as dated, Shuster insisted that the norm at BusinessWeek events be live, unrehearsed interviews, always with the potential for audience questioning of the executives on stage. Scott Shuster chaired all BusinessWeek events worldwide for 17 years further developing the all-discussion format at top-tier events including BusinessWeek’s forums of chief executive officers, chief financial officers, chief information officers, and other corporate leaders. He interviewed hundreds of business executives before audiences of their peers across the US, and as BusinessWeek’s international events footprint expanded to include the newly- open international business environments of China, Russia and Latin America, Scott brought the live interview business event format to Europe, Latin America and Asia. From President George H.W. Bush to Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, Scott has interviewed more than 5000 leaders and management executives. Today, while maintaining a role as consulting editor to The McGraw-Hill Companies, Scott continues his work as a business event moderator for corporations, governments, industry associations and professional societies. ===Examples of Business and Policy Forums Chaired by Scott Shuster=== * Toyota USA’s Together, We are Toyota National Dealer Meeting, Las Vegas, where Scott conducted a 90-minute live Q&A; session with Toyota’s entire US leadership team: The President of Toyota Motor Sales, the VP for the Toyota Division, the Sr. VP for Automotive Operations, and the President and CEO of Toyota Financial Services, in the presence of the founding/owning Toyoda family, and more than 5000 US Toyota dealer executives. * The Hashemite Royal Court (Government of Jordan) - A series of 6 investment promotion appearances of King Abdullah II and Queen Rania across the US, interviewing Their Majesties and others before gatherings of corporate executives considering investment in Jordan; In Amman and Dead Sea, Jordan: Six consecutive biennial Middle East and North Africa Region Information and Communications Technology Forums ( The MENA ICT Forum )each featuring one or more live interviews of HM King Abdullah onstage before information technology professionals from across the Arab region. * The Cisco CIO Summit - Moderator and interviewer at this three-day gathering of Cisco's top customers and senior leadership, including CEO John Chambers.

(1994). Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). pp. 388 - 389. The clan is officially recognized by the Lord Lyon King of Arms; however, as the clan does not currently have a chief recognized by the Lord Lyon, it is considered an armigerous clan. ==HistoryOrigins of the name=== The name Fletcher is derived from the French word flechier, which means arrow maker. The name was a very common trade name, so much so that it became used in the Scottish Gaelic language as fleisdear. In the eighteenth century some families went full circle and anglicised the name from the Gaelic, Mac-an-leistear, back into Fletcher. ===Origins of the clan=== Sometime after the eleventh century a band of Mac-an-leistears settled in Glen Orchy, Argyll. There they became arrow makers to the Clan MacGregor. Other small groups of Mac-an- leisters settled in glens that belonged to other clans, in order to make arrows for them. The first recorded clan chief was Angus Mac-an-leister, who was born in about 1450. However, Duncan Campbell of Glenorchy, who was in high royal favour with James VI of Scotland coveted the Mac-an-leister's lands. Campbell had royal authority to maintain a large band of armed retainers who he employed in a campaign of intimidation and violence. Campbell deliberately provoked a dispute with the Mac-an-leister chief and trumped up a murder charge against him. As a result, Mac-an-leister was compelled to sign a deed in which all of his family lands were ceded to the Campbells, and from then onwards they were only tenants in Glen Orchy. ===17th century=== Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun \\"the Patriot\\" was a fierce opponent of the union with England. He became MP for Haddington in 1678; however, he was forced to flee to Holland for having supported the Monmouth Rebellion against James II of England (VII of Scotland). ===18th century and Jacobite risings=== During the Jacobite rising of 1715 Archibald, ninth chief of the clan led the Mac-an- leisters in support of the Jacobites, as did his younger brother John during the Jacobite rising of 1745.

In 2009 they changed their name to St Andrews, and then to Hull United in 2014, when the club was rebranded after Jamie Waltham and ex-pro Jamie Barnwell-Edinboro joined up with John Duffill and Kenny Sayers, adopting a new nickname (\\"the Citizens\\") and changing their kit colours to black and white, echoing Hull City's original kit.'I'll pay you to come and watch my new football team' – Hull United AFC chairman Jamie Waltham Hull Daily Mail, 20 August 2014 Originally based at East Mount Recreation Centre, following their re-branding as Hull United the club moved to Dene Park, located in the village of Dunswell on the northern outskirts of Hull. The ground was originally the home of fellow Northern Counties East League side Hall Road Rangers F.C., who continued to share the ground with United before relocating to Haworth Park ahead of the 2015/16 season. On 15 August 2015 the club renamed the ground the \\"Breathe for Cameron Stadium\\" after local child, Cameron Good, who had died due to asthmatic complications during a football match he was involved in. In January 2015 the club appointed Curtis Woodhouse as manager, replacing chairman/first team manager Jamie Waltham, with fellow ex-Hull City teammate Ian Ashbee also joining as his assistant.Former Hull City man Curtis Woodhouse named as new Hull United manager Hull Daily Mail, 13 January 2015 One of the club's biggest matches came in March 2015 when they played Hull City Under-21s in the East Riding Senior Cup, beating them 3–2.Hull United 3 Hull City 2: Tigers dumped out ERCFA Cup by Citizens Hull Daily Mail, 24 March 2015 Following this win, they progressed to the final where they met Bridlington Town at the KC Stadium with Bridlington eventually winning 4–2.

The next game resulted in a 1–0 defeat at Teversal F.C. in the League Cup. However, they returned to league action with a 3–0 win over Dronfield Town F.C. a few days later, their first home game of the season, which attracted a crowd of 617. They kept up their good league form for the rest of the month, recording wins against Penistone, Westella VIP and a 7–0 thrashing of Grimsby Borough, as well as a draw at Hemsworth. This good run of form continued into September as they beat A.F.C. Emley and lead Glasshoughton Welfare before the game was abandoned early in the second half due to floodlight failure. A few days later they travelled to Selby Town and won 3–1, which meant after 8 games United sat 3 points clear at the top of the league and remained unbeaten. On 30 September 2015 it was revealed founder of the club and former chairman, Jamie Waltham would no longer be working with the club.'No longer wanted': Jamie Waltham shocked by Hull United exit Hull Daily Mail, 30 September 2015 Following this, their game against A.F.C. Mansfield was postponed due to being locked out of Dene Park by Jamie Waltham after he and the club were unable to agree on a lease to play there. This prompted the club to find another home. On 21 October the new ground was revealed to be the KC Lightstream Stadium, home of Hull Kingston Rovers. United started life at their new home with a 2–1 victory over Bottesford Town F.C. in the re-arranged fixture from earlier in the season. The game attracted a crowd of 431. 1 December saw the first competitive local derby against city rivals Hall Road Rangers, nicknamed the 'Hull Clasico'. The match ended 1–0 to United after a winning goal scored in the last seconds of the game. On 21 December it was announced that Gary Bradshaw had signed for the club from nearby Scarborough Athletic. His debut came in the second Hull derby against Hall Road on Boxing Day at Haworth Park, however the game ended in defeat for United after another winner in the dying seconds of the game, this time for Hall Road as it ended 2–1. They started 2016 with a 2–1 win against Winterton at the KC Lightstream Stadium, with Gary Bradshaw also getting his first goal for the club. This was to be their last game here as on 13 January the club announced it would no longer be playing at the stadium due to being unable to afford the match day running costs. On 15 January former North Ferriby captain and Scarborough Athletic Player/Manager Paul Foot signed for the club, joining up with fellow ex Ferriby legend Gary Bradshaw once more. It was revealed on 22 January that the club had made a request to groundshare with Brigg Town, however this was rejected by the league, meaning United would have to play their remaining games away until the end of the season or until a suitable ground could be found. Following this they were deducted 3 points after fielding a suspended player against Hallam F.C. earlier in the season, a game they won 2-0. They played their first game in a month on 2 February, after four games in January were postponed, beating Grimsby Borough 2-1 away, with Paul Foot scoring on his debut. The following game took place almost two weeks later on 13 February and saw them face North Ferriby in the East Riding Senior Cup for the first ever time. The game was played at South Hunsley School in Melton, just outside of Hull, and ended 2-1 to Ferriby, who fielded a reserve side, knocking United out of the cup. On 31 March manager Curtis Woodhouse left the club but was persuaded to re-join until the end of the season just a couple of days later, with Paul Foot taking charge of the game he missed.http://www.hullunitedafc.com/news/hull-united-afc-manager-curtis- woodhouse-has-stepped-down-with-immediate-effect Hull United AFC manager Curtis Woodhouse has stepped down with immediate effect It was also confirmed on the club website that they had acquired a 10-year lease of the old Endeavour School sports centre, as part of their recently formed partnership with Hull College, starting from the 2016/17 season. As United were hit hard by an 18-point deduction for three instances of player irregularities and an inability to obtain a ground/ground-share agreement for next season by 31 March deadline, on 21 April the Northern Counties East League decided to relegate them to a lower league designated by the FA as they have not \\"received a grading certificate by 31st March and not having an alternative proposal approved at the relevant Board Meeting\\" and as a consequence for this failure. Eight days later Craig Tock was introduced as the club's new chief executive officer, replacing John Duffill. After a statement was released from the club, it was revealed they will be participating in the Humber Premier League Division one from the 2016/17 season, with Ian Ashbee leaving his role as chairman and Curtis Woodhouse resigning as first team manager.http://www.hullunitedafc.com/news/hull-united-afc-club-statement On 5 July 2016 Hull United appointed Ashley Moon as the new Chairman and John Duffill as the Vice Chairman.http://www.hullunitedafc.com/news/hull-united- afc-have-appointed-ashley-moon-as-our-new-chairman ===Humber Premier League=== After leaving the NCEL they were placed in Division One of the Humber Premier League, two leagues below. 2016/17 proved to be a difficult season for United after starting again with virtually no players, however they managed to finish 2nd from bottom, one point above Hessle Sporting. The 2017/18 season saw an upturn in the Citizens' fortunes, after acquiring a number of players and staff from Hanson Jewellers who played the previous season in the league above, as well as several players returning from previous successful seasons for United. Positive results which started off the season continued throughout the campaign, keeping then in promotion contention, and also saw a good cup run in which they reached the semi-final of the Humber Premier League Cup against Pocklington, which they lost 2-0. They achieved promotion after finishing 2nd place. 2018/19 saw the team competing in the Humber Premier League Premier Division once again, but it was a difficult start for them as they won only one of their opening 7 games, drawing one and losing 5. However, after a couple of experienced additions to the squad they managed to turn things around. They finished the season in a very respectable 5th position, however their main success came in the Humber Premier League cup, winning the final on penalties after holding Chalk Lane to a draw in normal time, with Chalk Lane hoping to win the league and cup double for a second season in a row. This was United's second cup win since their rebrand in 2014, after winning it in their first season in 2014/15. They also reached the quarter final of the East Riding Senior Cup once again playing Chalk Lane but lost 2-1. The following season 2019/20 brought a rather mixed campaign in terms on league form, with lack of consistency being a big problem. Once again there were impressive cup runs though, in both the East Riding Senior Cup, with wins against East Hull and Hemingborough setting up a semi-final tie against North Ferriby F.C., and the Whitehead's Cup where they were unable to retain the trophy after a semi-final defeat against Pocklington. The season was declared null and void in March 2020, along with all other non-league football from step 7 down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==PlayersCurrent squad=Notable players=== Former professionals to have played for the club include:Hull United likely to step up to NCEL Division One Hull Daily Mail, 11 March 2015 *Danny Clarke *Ian Ashbee *Lawrie Dudfield *Mark Greaves *Martin Foster *Matty Plummer *Gary Bradshaw *Paul Foot *Francesco Carrera ==Non- playing staff== Chairman: Ciarán Phipps Chief Executive Officer: Lewis Poucher Secretary: Steve White Press Officer: John Duffill Director of Football: Paul Goldie Manager: John Duffill Assistant Manager: Steve White Coach: Ben Kinsley GK Coach: Dave Goldsmith Youth Football Officer (U'13's - U'18's: Kenny Sayers) Women's Team Manager: Kev Drewry Women's Team Assistant Manager: Mel Marsden Physio: Men's Team Captain: Lewis Poucher Woman's Team Captain: Amy Thompson ==Women's Team== On the 8th of June 2020, Hull United's social media accounts announced that the team would be setting up a women's team at level 6 in the pyramid, meaning that they'd be able to compete in the Women's FA Cup. ==HonoursLeague=== * Humber Premier League ** Runners-up (1): 2014–15 * Humber Premier League Division One ** Runners-up (1): 2017–18 ===Cup=== * Humber Premier League Cup ** Winners (1): 2014–15, 2018–19 * East Riding Senior Cup ** Runners-up (1): 2014–15 ==ReferencesExternal links== *Official website Category:Football clubs in England Category:Football clubs in the East Riding of Yorkshire Category:Association football clubs established in 2005 Category:2005 establishments in England Category:Sport in Kingston upon Hull Category:Humber Premier League Category:Northern Counties East Football League ","title":"Hull United A.F.C."},{"id":"46798097","text":"Sulaiman Khateeb was an Urdu, Deccani poet. ==ReferencesExternal links== *http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sslc-toppers- to-be-feted/article125698.ece *http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp- national/tp-andhrapradesh/mizahia-mushaira-sets-off-guffaws/article2829976.ece *http://www.karnatakamuslims.com/portal/great-deccani-urdu-poet-sulaiman- khateeb-on-the-web/ *Home page *http://www.siasat.com/english/news/suleman- khateeb%E2%80%99s-dakhini-urdu-poetry-reforms-society-%E2%80%93-mr-zahid-ali- khan *http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sulaiman-Khateeb *http://www.siasat.com/english/news/sulaiman-khateeb-memorial-function *http://www.caravanmagazine.in/arts/god-small-verse-dakhani-poetry-khateeb Category:Urdu poets from India Category:1922 births Category:1978 deaths Category:20th-century Indian poets Category:Indian male poets Category:20th- century Indian male writers ","title":"Sulaiman Khateeb"},{"id":"46798103","text":"The Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal was instituted by King William IV in 1830. The medal remained in use for 100 years, until it was replaced by the Medal for Long Service and Good Conduct (Military) in 1930. During that time the reverse of the medal remained virtually unchanged, while the design of the obverse was altered during the reigns of Queen Victoria, King Edward VII and King George V.Stephen Stratford Medals site - British Military & Criminal History - 1900 to 1999 - Army Long Service & Good Conduct Medal (Accessed 26 May 2015) ==Institution== The Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal was instituted by King William IV in 1830, for award to soldiers for long service and good conduct. It was the first non-campaign medal of the British Army. (Accessed 26 May 2015) The obverse of the original medal showed a Trophy of Arms that incorporated a central shield bearing the Royal Coat of Arms, with the House of Hanover Shield in its centre. On the Queen Victoria version, introduced after her succession to the throne in 1837, the Hanover emblem was removed from the central shield. Upon the succession of King Edward VII to the throne in 1901, his effigy was placed on the medal's obverse, followed by the effigy of King George V in 1910. ==Award criteria== The medal was initially awarded to soldiers in the ranks of the Regular Force who had completed 21 years of service in the infantry or 24 years in the cavalry. From 1870 the qualifying period was reduced and the medal was awarded to Regular Force non- commissioned officers and men who had completed eighteen years of irreproachable service, irrespective whether the service was in the infantry or the cavalry. A recipient who was subsequently awarded the Meritorious Service Medal had to stop wearing the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. ==Adoption== On 31 May 1895 Queen Victoria authorised Dominion and Colonial governments to adopt various military medals, including the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal, and to award them to their local military forces. Territories that took advantage of the authorisation include Canada, Cape of Good Hope, India, Natal, New South Wales, New Zealand, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and, from 1901, the Commonwealth of Australia. Commonwealth of Australia version These territorial medals were identical to the Victoria and Edward VII versions of the medal, but with the name of each respective territory inscribed in a curved line above the usual inscription on the reverse of their respective medals. In addition, instead of a plain crimson ribbon, the ribbon of each territorial medal has a 4 millimetres wide band added in the centre, in a colour to represent the specific territory.South African Medal Website – Colonial Military Forces (Accessed 6 May 2015) The award of these territorial versions of the medal was discontinued when the Permanent Forces of the Empire Beyond the Seas Medal was instituted in 1910 as a single common award for long service and good conduct in the Permanent or Regular Forces of the Dominions and Colonies.South African Medal Website – Union Defence Forces (1913–1939) (Accessed 9 May 2015) ==Order of wear== In the order of wear prescribed by the British Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal and its territorial versions rank on par with the Medal for Long Service and Good Conduct (Military) that replaced it in 1930. It takes precedence after the Accumulated Campaign Service Medal and before the Naval Long Service and Good Conduct Medal (1830). ==Description== The medal was struck in silver and is a disk, in diameter and thick. Apart from the different obverse designs that came into use with each successive monarch, the suspension of the medal evolved over the years from a small or large ring to a plain curved bar suspender, and eventually an ornamented scroll pattern suspender that was initially a swivelling type and finally a fixed non-swivelling type.The Real Royal Engineers - The Army Long Service Good Conduct Medal (Accessed 2 June 2015) ;Reverse The reverse of all versions of the medal is smooth with a raised rim and bears the inscription \\"FOR LONG SERVICE AND GOOD CONDUCT\\" in four straight lines in the centre. The inscription is underlined by two spear blades, which evolved from three tied balls between the two blades on early versions of the medal to three separate balls between the blades on later versions. ;Ribbon The ribbon was plain crimson from the medal's institution until 1916, initially wide for the early small ring suspender medals and thereafter wide for the subsequent medals with a large ring or bar suspenders. The same plain crimson ribbon was used with the Victoria Cross, but with a miniature button emblem of the Cross worn on the ribbon bar in undress. From June 1916 a new ribbon was used, at times crimson or sometimes reddish violet, and edged with 3 millimetres wide white bands.The Military Archive - Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal (Accessed 5 June 2015) ==VersionsKing William IV=== William IV version with curved bar suspender The King William IV version of the medal was struck in 1830. Since he was the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and King of Hanover, the obverse depicted a Trophy of Arms that incorporated a central shield bearing the Royal Coat of Arms, with the House of Hanover Shield in its centre. The obverse of this medal was designed by Benedetto Pistrucci, who also created the Saint George and the Dragon design which was used on the British gold sovereigns and crowns that first appeared during the Great Recoinage of 1816. The first suspender was a clip with a small ring, but a larger ring was used from 1831, as depicted in the main picture above. Some of the later King William versions of the medal were suspended from a bar formed from rectangular wire, with a \\"U\\" shape on the lower part to pass through the steel clip that attached it to the medal, as depicted alongside. ===Queen Victoria=== Victoria version with ring suspender In 1837, upon the coronation of Queen Victoria, the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended as a result of differing succession laws. In terms of Salic Law, Hanover could only be inherited by a male heir, with the result that Hanover's throne was inherited by Victoria's uncle Ernest Augustus, younger brother of King William IV. Victoria version with curved bar suspender On the Queen Victoria version of the medal, the House of Hanover Shield was therefore removed from the central shield on the obverse. The same Victorian obverse design was also used for the original version of the Distinguished Conduct Medal that was instituted in 1854. Victoria version with scroll suspender The reverse remained unaltered, while the suspender was still either a large ring or a rectangular wire bar, attached to the medal with an apparently silver clip. Victoria version with small lettering Due to the large number of these medals that were awarded during the long reign of Queen Victoria, new dies had to be cut from time to time, which resulted in differences in appearance. In 1855 a Victoria version of the medal with new swivelling scroll suspender began to be produced. The suspender was affixed to the medal by means of a double-toe claw and a horizontal pin through the upper edge of the medal. From 1874 a fourth version of the Victoria medal appeared, with smaller lettering on the reverse and with the underline to the inscription now two spear blades separated by three separate balls. The medal also had a redesigned and more elaborate scroll suspender. The Victoria version of the medal was awarded up to the Army Order of July 1902, post- dating her death. ===King Edward VII=== Edward VII version After the death of Queen Victoria, the obverse of the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal was changed to an effigy of the ruling monarch. The obverse of the Edward VII version, instituted in 1901, shows the King in Field Marshal's uniform, facing left, and is inscribed \\"EDWARDVS VII REX IMPERATOR\\" around the perimeter. The reverse of the medal remained unchanged, but the swivelling scroll suspender on this and subsequent versions was affixed to the medal by means of a single- toe claw and a horizontal pin through the upper edge of the medal. The Edward VII version of the medal was awarded up to the Army Order of April 1911, post- dating his death. ===King George V=== George V version The obverse of the George V version, instituted in 1910, shows the King in Field Marshal's uniform, facing left. It is inscribed \\"GEORGIVS V BRITT: OMN: REX ET IND: IMP:\\" around the perimeter.Veterans Affairs Canada - Long Service and Good Conduct (Army) Medal (Accessed 5 June 2015) In 1916 a new ribbon began to be used for the medal, as published in Army Order 183 of June 1916, to distinguish it from the ribbon of the Victoria Cross. It was still crimson, but edged with 3 millimetres wide white bands. In 1920 the swivelling scroll suspender was altered to a fixed non-swivelling type. The means of attachment to the medal remained a single-toe claw and a pin through the medal's upper edge. George V version with new ribbon and swivelling suspender Apart from the new ribbon, two other changes to the British long service and good conduct medal structure occurred during the reign of King George V. In 1910 the territorial versions of the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal were discontinued and replaced by the Permanent Forces of the Empire Beyond the Seas Medal, as a single common award for long service and good conduct in the Permanent or Regular Forces of the Dominions and Colonies. While the Royal Navy already had the Naval Long Service and Good Conduct Medal (1848), the birth of aerial warfare during the First World War and the establishment of the Royal Air Force in 1918 led to the institution of the Royal Air Force Long Service and Good Conduct Medal in 1919. ==Discontinuation== On 23 September 1930, 100 years after it had been instituted, the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal was replaced, along with the Permanent Forces of the Empire Beyond the Seas Medal, by the Medal for Long Service and Good Conduct (Military) as a single medal for the British Army and all regular and permanent military forces of the British Empire. This new medal once again had various territorial versions, but this time in the form of subsidiary titles inscribed on a bar attached to the suspender of the medal, rather than on the medal reverse. ==References== Category:Long and Meritorious Service Medals of Britain and the Commonwealth Category:Military awards and decorations of the United Kingdom ","title":"Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal"},{"id":"46798114","text":"Franco Mari (Born 23 January 1947) is an Italian actor and comedian.

At the end of high school years he founded the music band \\"Atabake\\" one of the pioneers of the \\"tropipop\\" musical genre in which he played drums and also sang a couple of songs. \\"Atabake\\" is remembered for songs like \\"Manuelita\\" and \\"A la media noche\\" both which were radio hits in Colombia. While he was in \\"Atabake\\" his time was also shared with his studies of musical production in Universidad de los Andes. He became a member of the famous Colombian band \\"Sin Animo de Lucro\\" with which he obtained many international nominations and recognitions such as a nomination for the Latin Grammys and 2 \\"Premios Shock\\" awards among others.

His music has an immense influence from British Rock which was induced by his father since he was a young boy but off course mixed with his Latino roots. In June 2013 he released his first single ´Volver a empezar¨ produced by Jorge Holguin ¨Pyngwi¨ “Pyngwi”. A song written towards the social reinsertion for the armed conflict in Colombia. The song hit the top of the juvenile radio charts in Bogota and managed to stay in the top 20 in \\"Fantastica Radio\\" and \\"La Meg\\"a. Later that year he received a nomination as\\" best new artist\\" in the Premios Shock de la música. His second single release \\"Como te voy a olvidar\\" is a song co-written with Argentinian producer, writer \\"Ditto Reschinga\\" and his former bandmates of \\"Sin Animo De Lucro\\" (Santiago Hernández and Camilo Rivera). It was produced by famous composer, musician, sound engineer, record Label manager and 4 time Grammy Award producer Bernardo Ossa (Thalia, David Bisbal, Andres Cepeda, Fonseca) and Fernando ¨Toby¨ Tobon former member of Ekhymosis and also Juanes guitarist. In this song he mixes andean sounds, \\"cumbia\\" and Pop. This song also had a remix called \\"Chucu-chucu version\\" co- produced by \\"Santiago Hernandez\\" and Samper himself. In 2014 he won a premio nuestra tierra RCN. In 2015 SAMPER released \\"No te vuelvo a perder\\". A classic rock ballad coproduced by him and \\"Tony Rijos\\" the renowned musical arranger and director for Ricardo Arjona and Prince Royce among others. It also features the participation of famous Latin musicians such as Guillermo Vadalá (Fito Páez), Michel Ferré (Lauryn Hill), Otto Ávalos (Ricardo Arjona) and Rodrigo Duarte. Recorded in Buenos Aires, Mexico, D.F, Miami and Bogota, mixed by \\"Bob St John\\" American producer for band Extreme and their famous song More Than Words. In 2016's \\"Todo se puede arreglar\\", SAMPER produced once again with “Pyngwi” . This song features a classic rock sound and speaks about not giving up. Mixed by Jeff Juliano (John Mayer, Jason Mraz, Paramore, Train...). He released it on national TV broadcast on the night of \\"Teletón Colombia\\". In 2017 he released \\"Pensando en Ti\\" feat. L'Omy, one of Colombia's new reggaeton artists. The song was produced by Miguel \\"Yera\\" Ospino in Bogotá, Colombia. The single was really well received across the country but mostly in Guatemala and Central American countries. It features a pretty nice mix between Samper's pop sound and vocals and Latin America's deep and rich rhythmic beats. In April 2017 he was hired as translator and vocal coach on Justin Bieber's Remix of Latin music smash hit single \\"Despacito\\" original by \\"Luis Fonsi\\" and \\"Daddy Yankee\\".

He is best known for his oil paintings but also has exhibited collages and sculpture. In 1969 and 1970, Wetzel exhibited with the Chicago Imagists, a grouping of Chicago artists who were ascendant in the late 1960s and early 1970s. ==Biography== Born in Elmhurst, Illinois, Wetzel was the second of three boys (with brothers David and Douglas). Both Wetzel's parents were artists. Wetzel's father, Wilbert, was a photoengraver. His mother, Elfreda, was a commercial artist. The family eventually settled in Arlington Heights, Illinois. Wetzel's interest in art developed at an early age, but he was also a three-time gymnastics individual medalist (pommel horse) on the Arlington High School (AHS) team that won two successive Illinois State Gymnastics Championships: 1958–59 and 1959–60. At age 17, two significant events influenced Wetzel's future direction. The first was the arrival of artist James F. Walker as an art teacher at Arlington High School. Walker arrived from his teaching position at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) during Wetzel's senior year, 1960–61. Walker was an artist who created mixed-media surrealist images. The second event was a trip to New York City to view an exhibition of the works of Max Ernst at the Museum of Modern Art. The influence of these two artists would shape Wetzel's vision for decades to come. After graduation, Wetzel enrolled in SAIC in fall 1961, where he studied with Vera Berdich, Whitney Halstead, Thomas Kapsalis, and Sonia Sheridan. While at SAIC, Wetzel met classmate and fellow artist Janice Anderson. They married after Janice's graduation in 1965. Prior to his marriage, Wetzel moved to Chicago's Old Town, a neighborhood known for the arts, its bars and nightlife, and 1960s hippie counterculture. In 1962, Wetzel opened the Sedgwick Street Gallery with AHS classmate Dennis Rice on North Avenue at the Sedgwick L Stop. The gallery was located up the street from the Mole Hole, home of the counterculture newspaper the Chicago Seed, and walking distance from Cabrini Green, a low-income, high- rise complex known for high poverty and crime. At the gallery, Wetzel and Rice exhibited the works of Karl Wirsum, Barry Malloy, Luis Ortiz, William Nichols, Bill Arsenault, Ed Paschke, and Wetzel's mentor, James F. Walker, as well as his own work. In 1968, Wetzel graduated with honors from SAIC with a BFA. The Institute awarded him a Foreign Travelling Fellowship, which he would later use to travel and study abroad. After graduating from SAIC, he continued his studies at Northern Illinois University, earning an MA in 1969. In the fall of 1970, Richard and his wife, Janice, traveled throughout Europe for eight months on his fellowship, studying art and architecture. After returning to Chicago, they both assumed teaching positions in city and suburban art departments, where they continued teaching until retirement, Janice in the Chicago Public Schools, and Richard in Niles Township High Schools. They lived, worked, and traveled together until Janice's death in 2014. ==The Chicago Imagists== The Chicago Imagists were a group of graduates and students of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, all in their 20s, who came to be regarded in the art world as “the Chicago vanguard.” Their work was exhibited at the Hyde Park Art Center (HPAC) in nine exhibitions between 1966 and 1972. The nine shows at HPAC were aligned into three groups: The Hairy Who, The Nonplussed Some, and The False Image. According to Robin Dluzen, the Imagists were “mainly white but with an unusually large percentage of female members … 7 women amongst 11 men …” These events were organized by Don Baum, exhibitions director at HPAC, and a participant in one of the nine shows. Baum would later organize two exhibitions for the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago. The first of these, Don Baum Says Chicago Needs Famous Artists, included works by Wetzel. The second show, Made in Chicago, did not. Made in Chicago traveled on to the São Paulo Bienal in Brazil and also to the Smithsonian Museum in Washington. James Yood offered a concise definition of the Imagist aesthetic: > … funky and irreverent subject matter (often with sexual and/or violent > overtones, with imaginative fantasies dealing with the figure under extreme > physical or psychological stress), a predilection for narrative themes drawn > from vernacular sources, a decided openness to influences from self-taught > artists and from sources outside the mainstream of Western art history, a > taste for garish and obsessively busy small-scale compositions driven by a > concern for symmetry and a linear approach to the figure, surrealistic > whimsy and ironic and caustic humor undercutting the “serious” status of the > art object, high-keyed color, scrupulous and fastidious craftspersonship > [sic] tending toward the suppression of evidence of the experiential residue > of the artist's hand, and iconic independence and idiosyncratic mannerism of > the most manic sort. Franz Schultze in ARTNews 1971 described a cliquishness in the various groups. > They cluster in small groups and—rather like the secret kids' clubs that > flourished in the days of radio serials and the Sunday funnies—they even > assume corporate names, like The Hairy Who ([Jim] Nutt, [Gladys] Nilsson, > [Karl] Wirsum, Suellen Rocca, Art Green, James Falconer), The Nonplussed > Some ([Ed] Flood, [Ed] Paschke, Sara Canright, Richard Wetzel, Don Baum), > the False Image (Roger Brown, Phil Hanson, Christina Ramberg, Eleanor Dube). In fact, as Schultze noted in 1969, Imagist artist Robert Guinan participated in the Nonplussed Some show but was later replaced by Don Baum in Nonplussed Some Some More. Shultze's omission of Guinan in 1971 points to a question of who is in the Imagist roster. Alan Artner, Chicago Tribune art critic, commented on the 2000 Imagist show at the Chicago Cultural Center: > Some artists in “Jumpin' Backflash”—Robert Guinan, Richard Wetzel—didn't fit > the developing definitions of the style and were passed by almost from the > beginning … … That few of the painters beyond Ed Paschke and Jim Nutt ever > took their art further perhaps says something about Imagism and arrested > development. Peter Schjeldahl in Art in America observed that from the first HPAC exhibition in 1966 the alignments among the artists morphed almost continually. > The groups miscegenated briskly in a series of Hyde Park shows that, with > themes and costumes, were also theatrical events: “Marriage Chicago Style,” > for instance, solemnized the joining of members of the Who and the Some, > plus Barbara Rossi. James Yood in 2000 observed, “Many of these artists did not feel at the time, nor do some admit today, that they are particularly linked to one another …” Wetzel's participation with the Imagists ended in 1970. Wetzel did show his work in the 2000 group exhibition at the Chicago Cultural Center, Jumpin' Backflash: Original Imagist Artwork, 1966–1969. This exhibit marked the first time that the works of all fifteen artists of the nine HPAC shows were included in one exhibition. Wetzel was quoted in the program notes for Jumpin' Backflash: > … the current exhibit is the first time that ALL the “Imagist” artists have > been included, in person or in print … it should present a rare opportunity > to read the works instead of the words. A documentary film about the Imagists was released in 2014, Hairy Who and the Chicago Imagists. From 1962, Wetzel has exhibited his work in both solo and group exhibitions. Sue Taylor in the Chicago Sun-Times observed in 1985 that > Like others associated with [The Chicago Imagists], now internationally > renowned, Wetzel has intensified the individual aspects of his style in the > 15 years since the inception of Imagism. Wetzel continues to live in Chicago, where he works in collaboration with DAKOtravail. ==From the critics== Whitney Halstead, Artforum, 1968 > The juxtapositions typical of collage are blended to achieve a lyrical (and > here, dreamlike) mood in Richard Wetzel's transfer images on glass. Black > Eyed Susan's Circle typifies his achievement in synthesizing disparate > elements in a quiet, understated tone. Franz Schultze, Chicago Daily News, 1968 > Wetzel makes dreamy, low-key collages with ectoplasmic faces … Harold Haydon, Chicago Sun-Times, 1969 > … Wetzel's large and ingenious photo collages … Franz Schultze, Chicago Daily News, 1969 > … Wetzel's complicated surrealist symbolism … Harold Haydon, Chicago Sun-Times, 1975 > With precision and subtlety, [Wetzel] draws organic and vegetable forms at > about the scale of cabbages and squashes, while emphasizing the prehensile > aspect of vegetation. Tendrils and claws reach out to grapple in these > imagined encounters in the land of chlorophyll. Just as vegetable claws > resemble beatle [sic] and crab pincers in Wetzel's drawings, so flying seeds > acquire monarch-butterfly and other insect wings. These drawings transmit > the essence of a quiet, desperate struggle from existence. Harold Haydon, Chicago Sun-Times, 1981 > Rapacious flowers and other vegetation, painted large—as if from an insect's > point of view—loom large against dark pastoral landscapes in Richard D. > Wetzel's exhibition … > In Wetzel's world, precisely painted plants, fierce in fang and claw, can be > as prosaic as green beans or as fantastic as root systems. Their victims > usually are eggs, whose fate is to be seized and devoured. Only one escapes, > in the painting titled “Deliverance,” borne aloft by a monarch butterfly and > by its coloration, obviously an egg of the monarch clan. > If all this imagery is taken as a paradigm of earthly existence, Wetzel's > view must be quite on the mark. Jeff Abell, New Art Examiner, 1984 > The paintings make use of intensely bright colors, most often to delineate > shapes against the generally darker background colors. For example, a > strange claw-like shape is outlined in a very hot yellow-orange against a > purple background, so that the figure glows against its ground. Sue Taylor, Chicago Sun-Times, 1985 > … the brilliant radiating colors and mysterious, iconic images that have > long distinguished Wetzel's art are still his major concerns. Each image is > set against a monochromatic background of the deepest blue, purple or green, > which may be read as an infinite spatial recession, indicative of the vague > realm of imagination. Sue Taylor, Chicago Sun-Times, 1985 > What is unique about his current paintings is their powerfully emotive > quality, for they operate largely on the level of feeling. The forms he > uses, for all their rich ambiguity, are direct, simplified, and distilled, > and their suggestiveness is of a kind everyone can understand—intuitively … David McCracken, Chicago Tribune, 1985 > … Zaks is showing paintings by Richard Wetzel, work very much in the Chicago > School tradition: hard-edged forms at once organic and artificial—they > reminded me, oddly, of electron photomicrography—in eerie, strangely erotic > colors.

He championed Afro-Cuban music traditions and sponsored artists such as Merceditas Valdés. == Career  Early life and career === Obdulio Morales Ríos was born in Havana on April 7, 1910. He learned piano from an American teacher and furthered his studies at the conservatory. At age 12 he began to play piano at the silent cinema, and a year later he was playing in private dance parties as a reserve pianist. Around the same time, while working as an apprentice for his father, who was a tailor, he began to attend black societies such as the Club Bohemio. In 1924 he joined the first lineup of Los Hermanos Martínez orchestra. === 1930s === Morales worked for the radio since 1928, specializing in Afro-Cuban music. In 1938 he premiered Batamú in collaboration with musician Julio Chappottín (father of Félix Chappottín) and choreographer Armando Borroto. This show featured famous conguero Chano Pozo and managed to sell out the Teatro Martí. In 1938 he also founded the Grupo Coral Folklórico de Cuba, an ensemble including a symphonic orchestra, Afro-Cuban drums and güiros. The ensemble featured batá master Trinidad Torregrosa, flautist Roberto Ondina and singers such as Candita Batista, Merceditas Valdés and Alfredo León Jr. At the same time, Morales was part of several successful big bands such as the eleven- piece Los Melódicos, an orchestra that he directed by 1939 and also featured Chano Pozo on quinto. He also played in Habana Jazz band and in 1931 Orquesta Elegante, the backing band of danzonete singer Paulina Álvarez. === 1940s and 1950s === In 1942 the Grupo Coral Folklórico de Cuba became the Conjunto Coral Sinfónico Folklórico de Cuba, and together with Fernando Ortiz he began to give lectures about Afro-Cuban music at the Hispano-Cuban Culture Society and the Society for Afro-Cuban studies. Beginning in 1943, Morales conducted Afro- Cuban music performances on Sundays which were broadcast by Radio Cadena Suaritos. In the 1950s Morales was responsible for the score of several films including Rincón criollo (1950), Una gitana de La Habana (1950), Sandra, la mujer de fuego (1954) and Yambaó (1957). In 1955, Morales was the conductor in Ñáñigo, an LP by Puerto Rican singer Ruth Fernández with a repertoire of classics by Moisés Simons, Ernesto Lecuona, Eliseo Grenet and Gilberto Valdés. === Late career and death === During the 1960s, Morales conducted a late night program at Radio Rebelde featuring vocalist Gina Martín. He also became the director and arranger of Antobal's Cuban All-Stars. In 1972 he became the director of Conjunto Folklórico Nacional de Cuba's orchestra, with which he toured Europe. He continued his research into Afro-Cuban culture, giving talks and collaborating with Zoila Lapique Becali on a study on Cuban music publishing between 1829 and 1902. In 1980, while retired and ill, he founded Afrofónico, another Afro-Cuban music group.

He attended St John's School, Leatherhead for secondary school/high school before attaining a BA in War Studies from King's College London, an MSc in Middle Eastern Politics from the School of Oriental and African Studies, and a Graduate Diploma in Law from The College of Law in London. Though he grew up in the United Kingdom, his political career began in the United States when he worked as an intern in Washington, D.C., during the 2004 US Presidential Campaign. He also had a short stint working for a British Member of Parliament, Humfrey Malins, during 2005. His first television appearances were in the United Kingdom, as a commentator on US and international politics on news outlets such as BBC and Sky News during the 2012 US Presidential Election. In 2012 he moved to Washington, D.C. He has contributed to news organisations, including The Week, The Spectator, The Weekly Standard, Reuters, The American Spectator, The Daily Caller, Fox News, The Washington Times, USA Today, CNN, The Christian Science Monitor, The Atlantic, The Commentator, The Telegraph, The Guardian Tom Rogan The Guardian and The Huffington Post. He is a columnist for the National Review and Opportunity Lives.http://opportunitylives.com/tag/tom-rogan/ In 2014, he began making increasingly frequent TV appearances as a pundit/commentator on news outlets such as Fox News and CNN. A specialist in Middle-Eastern politics and US foreign policy, he featured regularly as a commentator on various news outlets during the initial uprising of ISIS in 2014, occasionally making multiple TV appearances a day. He has appeared twice on the HBO show, Real Time with Bill Maher. In August 2014 he was chosen as the inaugural chair of the ‘Tony Blankley Chair for Public Policy and American Exceptionalism’ award by the Steamboat Institute, a conservative political group based in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, in memory of political analyst Tony Blankley. In 2014 he was a frequent guest panelist on The McLaughlin Group, becoming a regular panelist in 2015. He became a mentee of John McLaughlin and the two developed a very close relationship. At John McLaughlin's funeral, Rogan was one of the first speakers and maintains a close relationship with the McLaughlin family. In 2017, Rogan joined the Washington Examiner as a commentary writer. In August 2017, a pilot episode of a proposed revival of The McLaughlin Group with Rogan as moderator was taped and published on YouTube. On January 8, 2018, The McLaughlin Group relaunched with Rogan as moderator. In contrast to the previous format in which there were four semi-permanent panelists, the new version features a rotating guest each week. The show aired on WJLA-TV, the local ABC affiliate for the greater Washington, D.C. area, for a few months, then became available online only. After going into hiatus in January 2019, the show returned to the air, with Rogan as moderator and the same format, in September 2019 on Maryland Public Television, which began distribution of the show to PBS stations nationally in January 2020.The McLaughlin Group at mclaughlin.comWilliams, Tom, \\"The McLaughlin Group returns to public television in September,\\" globenewswire.com, August 12, 2019, 15:39 EDT, Retrieved August 13, 2019.

In his article, Rogan says that the Ukrainian air force should bomb the Crimean Bridge, and that the US should support this. He also claims that the length of the bridge would reduce the number of casualties by those crossing at the time of the attack. The article provoked a strong reaction in Russia, instantly turning the Washington Examiner into the most frequently cited periodical. Many spoke about the article, including the Vice Speaker of the Russian Parliament Irina Yarovaya; and the Russian Embassy to the United States demanded an explanation from Tom Rogan. On 17 May, the Investigative Committee of Russia opened a criminal investigation against Tom Rogan, accusing him of calling for terrorism. Tom Rogan reacted with his new article in Washington Examiner titled \\"Why Putin wants to send me to the Black Dolphin\\" and he received support in the editorial \\"Our response to Russia's threats against our journalists\\". In the latter it was stated, that Rogan's piece is \\"an opinion on how one sovereign nation ought to respond to aggression\\". On May 18, the Investigative Committee opened criminal case against the editor of the Washington Examiner, Hugo Gurdon, too. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Tom Rogan Thinks..., blog * Category:American political commentators Category:American political writers Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of King's College London Category:American male journalists Category:American male writers Category:21st-century American journalists Category:Anti-Russian sentiment Category:People educated at St John's School, Leatherhead ","title":"Tom Rogan"},{"id":"46798334","text":"Robert Calvert (1945–1988) was a South African-born English musician and writer.

From a junior branch of the Bertie family which had inherited estates at Weston-on- the-Green in Oxfordshire, he represented that county in Parliament from 1743 until standing down before the bitterly contested 1754 election. He was unfriendly to the Hanoverian succession and sat in opposition to the government. Norreys was the son of James Bertie (d. 1728), of Springfield, Essex, and Elizabeth Harris, and grandson of Hon. Henry Bertie and Philadelphia Norreys. His father succeeded to the Norreys estates upon the death of James Norreys in 1718, and Norreys succeeded him in 1728. The estates included the manors of Weston-on-the Green in Oxfordshire, Yattendon, Hampstead Norreys, and Bothampstead in Berkshire. He matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford on 5 December 1734, at the age of 16. He received his MA on 27 May 1738. On 12 September 1741, he bought the manor of Notley and Notley Abbey from his uncle, Rev. Charles. At the 1741 election, his second cousin once removed, the Earl of Abingdon, supported him as a Tory candidate for Westbury. Bertie and the opposition Whig John Bance were both defeated by the Government candidates, Joseph Townshend and Hon. George Evans. He stood again in 1743, at a by-election in Oxfordshire following the succession of the 3rd Earl of Lichfield to the peerage. Oxfordshire was a Tory stronghold in which the Bertie and Norreys families had traditionally been prominent, and Bertie was returned unopposed. He sat in opposition to the Carteret and Pelham ministries, and in the debate in January 1744, spoke for the recall and disbanding of the British troops in Flanders. He also opposed the employment of Hanoverian troops, and refused to join the Oxfordshire association in defense of the Hanoverian succession during the Jacobite rising of 1745. At the 1747 election, he was returned unopposed in Oxfordshire, and for unknown reasons received a single vote at Westbury (where the Abingdon interest backed Bance and the Tory Paul Methuen). He opposed the regency bill in 1751, and seconded a motion for the reduction of the army in that year. At the 1754 election, Bertie stood down but continued to support the Tory candidates for Oxfordshire, which experienced a particularly tempestuous poll. Bertie spent the end of his life on the continent, evidently in increasing financial straits; he was forced to mortgage Notley Abbey to discharge the mortgage on Hampstead Norreys farm. He was not able to redeem Notley and sold it to the banker Francis Child on 12 September 1758. Bertie died bankrupt at Ghent in 1766. Unmarried, he left his estate to his second cousin once removed, Captain Peregrine Bertie. Hampstead Norreys was charged with an annuity to Peregrine's sister Elizabeth, wife of John Gallini. ==NotesReferences== Category:1710s births Category:1766 deaths Category:Tory MPs (pre-1834) Category:British MPs 1741–1747 Category:British MPs 1747–1754 Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies ","title":"Norreys Bertie"},{"id":"46798532","text":"Marko Vrzgula (born 24 February 1966, Košice, Slovakia) is a Slovak painter and organiser of exhibitions and symposiums for painters. He is one of the founding members of the association The Blue Pears [Modré Hrušky] (1988). Vrzgula is the author of the concept of the gallery GUBA http://www.guba.sk/index.php?x=about (2004) as well as its manager. GUBA comprises nine individual venues altogether – amounting to approximately 2 400 m² of exhibition area. GUBA is an authentic space of contemporary architecture where the exhibited artworks communicate with people and the environment in their everyday reality. More than 50 Slovak and Czech artists have held long- term exhibitions of their works here. Since 2004 Vrzgula is a freelance artist. He lives and workshttp://www.guba.sk/index.php?showimage=2370 in Bratislava and in the village of Lúčky – near Ružomberok, located in the Liptov region. == Studies and pedagogical career == Vrzgula attended and then graduated from the Department of Painting at the Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Bratislava in the years 1985 – 1991. Between the years 1992 and 2002 Vrzgula was a pedagogue at the Department of Painting at the Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Bratislava (Introduction to painting and drawing for 1st – 5th year students). From 2002 – until 2004 he taught at the Department of Creative Arts and Art Education at the Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra. == Exhibitions == Since the year 1988 Vrzgula has presented his work at more than twenty solo exhibitions in Slovakia (Bratislava, Martin, Poprad, Spišská Nová Ves, Košice, Žilina, Dolný Kubín,http://www.oravskagaleria.sk/english_version.html Zvolen, Senica), but also abroad, in the French Hégenheim and in Herzliya (Israel). He also participated at more than fifty collective exhibitions, among them also exhibitions in Vienna, St. Pölten and in Horn (Austria), in Warsaw and in Poznan (Poland), in Munich and Bruckmühl (Germany), in Novi Sad (the former Yugoslavia), in Washington (USA), in Sofia (Bulgaria), in Cagnes-sur-Mer (France), in London (Great Britain), in the Czech republic and in Slovakia.http://vrzgula-art.guba.sk/mainwin.html Vrzgula also participated at an international symposium in the Austrian town of Horn, at a symposium of large format paintings in Dolný Kubín (2 times), at a painters’ symposium in Moravany nad Váhom, at the program Artists-in-Residence – Jelení Studio in Prague, at the plein air painting in Malá Franková (2 times). Since the year 2010 Vrzgula has been organising the symposium Lúčky (4 times).http://kultura.sme.sk/c/6593043/nove-vystavy.html == Painting artwork == Vrzgula’s work developed into and persists in a multi-layered range of contents and forms. He is a classic artist who spontaneously reacts to everyday life impulses and does not pose any conceptual filters between himself and the world. Straightforwardness is his concept and also the most suitable word used to describe his approach to motif. Only once this motif is brought into his coloured laboratory does Vrzgula start his artistic research on it. It’s uncompromising, authentic and radical and the outcome is usually on the verge of an abstract painting. His paintings are known for their characteristic strong paint-gestures that are created by different means of applying the coloured medium (with a roller, frottage, dripping, spatula, haptic inputs...) He works in longer cycles that go on for a number years. He abstracted the figure in his thesis Windows (Okná, 1990-1991). A rotating foam cylinder defined the stripe compositions of the years long cycle Intersections (Prieniky,1993-2000).http://www.webumenia.sk/cedvuweb/image/SVK_OGD.O_2013.jpeg?id=SVK:OGD.O_2013http://www.guba.sk/index.php?showimage=44 He used a similar artistic approach of the repetition of horizontal lines also in his subsequent cycle Bridges (Mosty, 2004-2011)http://www.guba.sk/index.php?showimage=3 – where he achieved a staccato style grid from imprints of real wooden boards and pieces on the painting. Another one of Vrzgula’s cycle is Movements and Spirals (Pohyby a Špirály, 2006-2012),http://www.guba.sk/index.php?showimage=1193 where we see the coloured pastes become more and more dominant and thus create a pre-step for the latest years-long cycle of Vrzgula called Pulsars (Pulzary, 2011-2015).http://www.guba.sk/images/20140311143654_marko%20vrzgula%20-%20pulzary%202013%2002.jpghttp://www.guba.sk/index.php?showimage=2028 Vrzgula keeps on improving his own recipe for acryl that is able to carry an extreme amount of colour paste. This allows him to create haptic reliefs full of coloured messages. He models them with his fingers and they can be perceived also through the touch of one’s hands. This is how Vrzgula physically takes direct part in the creation of the composition without using any tools. The most significant part of such a creation is most probably the actual process – the work and movement of the author on the surface of the painting. Although Vrzgula’s paintings are created through a carefully set up process, it is still just a gesture – that revives a coloured mass and that gives each shape its own, unique character. Before every one of his compositions Vrzgula creates a sketch which on its own is very interesting and of a high artistic quality. It could well be presented as an artwork itself. In Vrzgula’s latest works these sketches are seeing a change. From being drawn on small paper surfaces they are now sketched on large canvases and their restless, vibrant line structure defines not only the core of the composition but also the whole surface of the painting. == External links == * Vrzgula: online selection of paintings from his artwork * POLČAS  PRINTEMPS  PRIME TIME exhibition in Tatra gallery Poprad, 2015 * SME.sk: Marko Vrzgula: \\"Art is for those who want to perceive it\\" * Jozef Baus a Marko Vrzgula: Connection in the gallery SPP 01 *Baus-Vrzgula = Allies * Pravda.sk: Marko Vrzgula a Jozef Baus are allies * Marko Vrzgula: I burn for a while, I smoulder for a while * Jozef Baus a Marko Vrzgula: Allies * Marko Vrzgula: Pulsars * Slovenskecentrum.sk: Painter Marko Vrzgula will hold his debut exhibition in Israel ==References== Slovak painter Category:Living people Category:1966 births Category:Abstract painters Category:Slovak artists ","title":"Marko Vrzgula"},{"id":"46798533","text":"Eighth Street Bridge is a road bridge over the Passaic River in northeastern New Jersey, United States. Opened in 1915 as a bascule bridge, the bridge was fixed in place in 1977. The Eighth Street Bridge connects the City of Passaic in Passaic County with the Borough of Wallington in Bergen County and is jointly owned by both counties. The bridge connects Eighth Street in Passaic with County Route 507 in Wallington. As of 2014, the bridge was used by about 6,500 vehicles per day. The Eighth Street Bridge was closed to traffic permanently on July 24, 2017 so work could begin on its replacement. ==Location and operations== Eighth Street Bridge passes over the Passaic 11.7 miles from the river mouth at Newark Bay in at the Passaic and Bergen county line. It carries a 2-lane road, 2 sidewalks, and a utility pipe from 8th Street in Passaic to Main Avenue in Wallington. and as of 2014, is used by about 6,500 vehicles per day. The lower of the Passaic River downstream of the Dundee Dam is tidally influenced and channelized. Once one of the most heavily used waterways in the Port of New York and New Jersey, it remains partially navigable for commercial marine traffic. The bridge has been in fixed closed position since 1977 and only bridge at MP 11.7 and those downstream from it are required by federal regulations to open. ==Design and construction== Built in 1914, the Eight Street Bridge is a Warren pony truss bridge, originally a bascule bridge. The total length with a deck width . The length of largest span: It follows the design of Strauss Bascule Bridge Company of Chicago and was fabricated by the F.R. Long - W.G. Broadhurst Company of hackensack. The main span was an long is a Strauss articulated overhead counterweight single leaf bascule span. The entire bridge is supported on a concrete substructure. It originally was composed of built-up members as were the trunnion columns, braced counterweight tower, and counterweight linkages that permitted the counterweight to pivot and move parallel to itself during operation of the bridge. The bridge was significantly rehabilitated 1965, when a steel grid deck was installed. Between 1976 and 1979 the bridgeman's shanty was demolished and operating controls for the electric-motor powered span were removed and the bridge was fixed in the closed position. The gear sets and shafts were left in place as was the chain-operated manual operation. The original metal sidewalk railings are intact. The 300-ton counterweight, used to open the bridge, began to crumble onto passing cars and had to be removed. The State Historic Preservation Office determined in that Eighth Street Bridge was of historical and engineering merit to be included in the state (ID#3426)) and federal register of historic places. ==Replacement== The bridge has seriously deteriorated and as of 2015 was in a state of severe disrepair and considered to be structurally deficient and fracture critical. There are 13 ton, 19 ton and 30 ton weight restrictions.FY 2013 TRANSPORTATION CAPITAL PROGRAM New Jersey Department of Transportation Projects Plans to replace the bridge have been in place since 2012. Funding is provided by state and federal sources. Land acquisition of parcels in the vicinity of the bridge has been mired in legal eminent domain battles have hampered replacement. After delays of several months, the bridge was closed to traffic on July 24, 2017. Construction of the new bridge is being undertaken by Passaic County and is expected to be completed in 2019.http://www.co.bergen.nj.us/documentcenter/view/8948 ==See also== *List of crossings of the Lower Passaic River *Botany Worsted Mills Historic District == References == Category:Bridges over the Passaic River Category:Bascule bridges in the United States Category:Bridges completed in 1915 Category:Road bridges in New Jersey Category:Wallington, New Jersey Category:Buildings and structures in Passaic, New Jersey Category:Bridges in Bergen County, New Jersey Category:Bridges in Passaic County, New Jersey Category:Road bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in New Jersey Category:National Register of Historic Places in Bergen County, New Jersey Category:National Register of Historic Places in Passaic County, New Jersey Category:Steel bridges in the United States Category:Warren truss bridges in the United States ","title":"Eighth Street Bridge (Passaic River)"},{"id":"46798538","text":"The Budapest Reference Connectome server computes the frequently appearing anatomical brain connections of 418 healthy subjects. It has been prepared from diffusion MRI datasets of the Human Connectome Project into a reference connectome (or brain graph), which can be downloaded in CSV and GraphML formats and visualized on the site in 3D. ==Features== The Budapest Reference Connectome has 1015 nodes, corresponding to anatomically identified gray matter areas. The user can set numerous parameters and the resulting consensus connectome is readily visualized on the webpage. Users can zoom, rotate, and query the anatomical label of the nodes on the graphical component. ==Background== Budapest Reference Connectome is a consensus graph of the brain graphs of 96 subjects in Version 2 and 418 subjects in Version 3. Only those edges are returned which are present in a given percentage of the subjects. Each of the selected edges has a certain weight in each of the graphs containing that edge, so these multiple weights are combined into a single weight, by taking either their mean (i.e., average) or median. The user interface allows the customization of these parameters: the user can select the minimum frequency of the edges returned. There is an option for viewing and comparing the female or male reference connectomes. The connectomes of women contain significantly more edges than those of men, and a larger portion of the edges in the connectomes of women run between the two hemispheres. ==Discoveries== The Budapest Reference Connectome has led the researchers to the discovery of the Consensus Connectome Dynamics of the human brain graphs. The edges appeared in all of the brain graphs form a connected subgraph around the brainstem. By allowing gradually less frequent edges, this core subgraph grows continuously, as a shrub.

The shadow play group automatically advanced to the grand finals after receiving the highest nationwide votes from their semi-finals performance. They were the first one to get to the grand finals. The group then performed a tourism-inspired shadow play, advocating the tourist spots in the Philippines, during their grand finals performance held on October 23, 2011 at the Ynares Sports Center in Antipolo. They eventually garnered the fourth spot after receiving 8.05% of the votes. Since then, they were usually invited to perform as guest stars in various places and shows. In particular, they became regular guests in It's Showtime, performing acts such as a tribute to Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) who are unable to spend Christmas with their families in the Philippines, a tribute to the death anniversary of the late former senator Benigno Aquino, Jr., and an inspirational number about hope and faith performed during the Holy Week. ===Asia's Got Talent=== On September 28, 2014, El Gamma Penumbra pre-auditioned at the SMX Convention Center, SM Mall of Asia for the upcoming first Asia's Got Talent to be held in Singapore. They advanced to the televised audition held at the Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios in Johor, Malaysia, wherein they were almost not able to join because of a conflict in their schedule. They chose to perform during Pope Francis's visit to the Philippines first, which was already scheduled beforehand, and was still able to fly to Malaysia for the taping. Among their 27 members, only 13 were selected to compete due to budget constraints. They eventually advanced to the semifinals night after receiving a golden buzzer by Indonesian artist Anggun, while Taiwanese singer Vanness Wu complimented: \\"I loved how you guys told the stories beautifully and it was just so wonderful to see live and up close. Thank you so much for that great job.\\" During the franchise's semifinals night, the shadow play group performed a routine based centrally on war, recovery from war, and peace to Matisyahu's \\"One Day\\". Their performance, aired on April 30, earned them another golden buzzer from the four judges, enabling them to take a spot in the grand finals automatically. They were the only Filipino act among the four to receive both golden buzzers. Canadian musician and record producer David Foster said: \\"I just want to say that I live in a box, where I make music in a studio. And tonight, I got to come outside of my box and see something that was so, so moving and magical. It just amazed me.\\" Before announcing the winner of Asia's Got Talent season 1 aired on May 7, the remaining nine contestants performed their own pieces at the Marina Bay Sands. With \\"Colors of the Wind\\" from Disney's animated film Pocahontas as the background song, El Gamma Penumbra performed a shadow play that incorporates global issues in hopes to share a message to save Mother Nature. The next week, on May 14, the second part of the grand finals night was aired, announcing El Gamma Penumbra as the overall winner based on public votes. The group was the first to win in Asia's Got Talent reality TV show. The group received USD100,000 for their prize money, as well as an opportunity to perform at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. The group leader's exclaimed: \\"Asia's Got Talent is the highlight of our careers and of our lives.\\" They were then given a heroes' parade in their hometown of Tanauan, province of Batangas, who welcomed them in their return from said contest. ==Artistry== El Gamma Penumbra was chosen to be a part of the Philippine tourism campaign 'Choose Philippines'. Due to their ability to be able to deliver a message through their shadow acts, they were chosen in hopes to strengthen the campaign's mission in promoting the Philippines. During their stay in Asia's Got Talent season 1, the four judges had always been commenting about El Gamma Penumbra's message-filled performances. Particularly, Indonesian judge Anggun mentioned: \\"Our job as entertainers, if you can raise awareness on important issues, like Mother Nature and animals, that will make our job more noble,\\" after their last performance in the show. After winning, Negrense artist Charlie Co cited El Gamma Penumbra as a group who inspired people all around the world to contribute to the society's welfare through their talents and art. In an interview, El Gamma Penumbra admitted that it was always been a challenge to think of a fresh and meaningful concept for their next performance saying: \\"It's really hard because we have different cultures and we have to touch their hearts. So, we have to think of concepts that are universal so that everyone will understand.\\" In addition, they are also devoted in exhibiting their performances well that their practices usually left them sleep deprived. According to the group's creative head, Marvin Marfa, they dedicated their 22 hours to rehearse and used the remaining two hours for sleeping in the dance studio during Asia's Got Talent. ==Philanthropy== El Gamma Penumbra have been constantly donating to the home for the elderly, particularly to the Sta. Ana- San Joaquin Bahay Ampunan in Tanauan City. In addition, the group is planning to set up a shadow dance studio for less fortunate kids in hopes to encourage them develop their talents instead of wasting them inNewsaccessdate=25 May 2015}} ==ReferencesCategory:Got Talent winners Category:Pilipinas Got Talent contestants Category:Reality show winners Category:Star Magic Category:Filipino theatre people ","title":"El Gamma Penumbra"},{"id":"46798701","text":"Muddy Waters (born McKinley Morganfield, 1913–1983) was an American blues guitarist and singer.

It is the fourth parish in the city and one of the oldest in the Archdiocese of Louisville. Founded as a church for German immigrants on the east side of Louisville in 1853, the church building was completed and dedicated on August 20, 1854. Expanded in the 1860s and renovated in the 1890s, the church building remains one of the oldest large structures and one of the few remaining antebellum public buildings in Louisville. ==History== St. Martin of Tours Church is notable for its role in bringing several religious orders to the Louisville area. Its first priests were German Franciscans, who had already established foundations in Cincinnati and at the first German parish in the city, St. Boniface. The first pastor, Fr. Leander Streber, OFM, was responsible for introducing the Ursuline sisters to the city, and it has been suggested that these sisters were the first to establish a foundation of that order within the borders of the United States (other older foundations currently in the country were not under the American government at the time of their founding).Spoekler, p. 2 These sisters established the first parish school at St. Martin of Tours in 1858 and shortly thereafter founded the Ursuline Academy for girls one block away. In 1863 the Xaverian Brothers began a school for boys at St. Martin of Tours, their first establishment in the city.Cousins, p.14 In 1888, the Brothers of Mary took over the instruction of the boys in a new building that now serves as the rectory and parish offices. These brothers continued teaching at the parish until 1917, when the Ursuline sisters took over all instruction at the parish school.Cousins, p.17 The political turmoil of mid-nineteenth-century America played an important part in the early history of the parish, and that of the greater immigrant Catholic population of Louisville. On August 6, 1855, the members of the Know-Nothing party, whipped into hysteria by the flame-fanning of the editor of the Louisville Journal,George D. Prentice aimed their revolt at the Cathedral of the Assumption on 5th Street and at St. Martin of Tours Church. Suspecting the German Catholics at St. Martin's of armed, anti- government organizing, the Know-Nothings intended to burn both churches to the ground. Bloody Monday Through the intervention of the bishop, Martin John Spalding, who invited the Know-Nothing mayor of Louisville to inspect the premises of both buildings, the Catholic congregations were exonerated. All the same, at least 20 people died in what came to be known as the Bloody Monday Riots.Crews, p.20-21 ==Relics and artifacts== The church building underwent significant changes in the 1890s, including a new vaulted ceiling, new stained-glass windows from the Royal Bavarian Art Glass Institute, and a new stone façade complete with a bronze statue of St. Martin. Among the church's artistic treasures from this period is also its pipe organ, which was built by the Farrand & Votey firm of Detroit. The short-lived pipe organ shop at that company was populated by the craftsman from the recently-defunct Roosevelt organ company. Among the contributions these organbuilders made to organ design was the first electric action patents in the country. When these craftsmen were brought over to Farrand & Votey, they brought their patents with them. In 1894, St. Martin of Tours contracted for a new 3-manual and pedal pipe organ with Farrand & Votey and that instrument has remained largely-unchanged since its installation. It remains one of the few and largest remaining electric-action organs from that seminal era in the world.Spoekler, p.21 In June 1901, the Right Reverend Monsignor Mezzolinski, secretary to Cardinal Mieczysław Halka Ledóchowski, wrote to the pastor of St. Martin of Tours, Monsignor Francis Zabler: \\"At last I can fulfill your wish. The venerable Cistercian Nuns of Agnani, Italy, must give up their sanctuary and relinquish their monastery and seek another house. In their sad plight, Pope Leo XIII has given them permission to donate the relics of certain martyrs under certain conditions. I myself have been at Agnani to investigate the authenticity of these relics. Without a doubt they are genuine.\\"Spoekler, p.26 On December 31, 1901, the complete skeletal relics of St. Magnus,a Roman centurion Magnus of Anagni and martyr, and St. Bonosa, a Roman virgin and martyr, arrived at the Louisville customs office. They were placed in glass reliquaries beneath the north and south transept altars, where they have been venerated ever since. In 2012, these reliquaries were restored after authentication of the remains proved the saints' stories as true, and their altars were renovated. On September 9 of that year, Ss. Magnus and Bonosa were solemnly reinterred in a Solemn High Mass. ==Outreach== St. Martin of Tours supports two institutions that serve the poor in downtown Louisville. The Schuhmann Center is named for Mons. George W. Schuhmann (1865-1931) and opened in 1982 to aid homeless persons and others in need with clothing, emergency food, and social service referrals. The Golden Arrow Center for mothers and children was opened in 1997 and provides maternity clothes, children's clothing, diapers, baby food, formula and an emergency pantry. The Golden Arrow Center serves people from throughout the greater-Louisville metro area and is one of the only children's clothing charities in Louisville. The Schumann Center and Golden Arrow Center serve tens of thousands of people each year. File:Reinterment Mass for Ss. Magnus and Bonosa.jpgThe Shrines of Ss.

(see 1875 Topographical Sketch, in External Links) It was variously located during its history from the mouth of the Virgin River to 6 miles below the mouth of the Virgin River, opposite the Detrital Valley which provided an easy path into and out of the canyon of the Colorado River from the south and to and from the north through the Virgin and Muddy Valleys to Nevada and Utah. Subsequently, it was moved up river to a location, opposite Detrital Wash, which is its current GNIS location determined in an 1875 survey.James H. McClintock, Mormon Settlement in Arizona; a Record of Peaceful Conquest of the Desert, Manufacturing Stationers, Phoenix, Arizona, 1921 ==History== Originally Stone's Ferry was a Colorado River crossing at the mouth of the Virgin River between the Virgin River and Muddy River settlements of the Mormons in Pah-Ute County, Arizona and the rest of Arizona Territory by a road southward to the mines at Chloride, Mineral Park and Cerbat and to the Hardyville - Prescott Road. It was informal, using boats that were left there for that necessity up until after the time Brigham Young visited the Muddy and Virgin River settlements in 1870. Stone's Ferry was also a landing for the barges of Captain L. C. Wilburn who poled and sailed his barges up river to bring down salt from the Mormon's Virgin River valley salt mines for the mills of El Dorado Canyon.Richard E. Lingenfelter, Steamboats on the Colorado River, 1852-1916, University of Arizona Press, Tucson, 1978 The salt was used to process their silver ore. When the Mormon colonists voted to abandon their settlements in the Muddy and Virgin valleys in 1870, Daniel Bonelli of St. Thomas, was the only one who voted no, and remained. He moved his family, acquired the ferry boat and established a commercial ferry boat service at Stone's Ferry, at first located 6 miles down river from the mouth of the Virgin. The ferry was subsequently moved up river to a point 2 miles below the Virgin River mouth, opposite the mouth of Detrital Wash. In 1876 Bonelli moved the ferry and his family up river to the near the old settlement of Junction City, just east of the mouth of the Virgin River and renamed the ferry Bonelli's Ferry. ==Site today== The site of Stone's Ferry is now under the Virgin Basin of Lake Mead. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Topographical Sketch showing the Outward and Inward Route of a Party, while examining as to the practicability of a Diversion of the Colorado River for Purposes of Irrigation, Lithograph by Eric Bergland, 1875.

Stuart High School in Falls Church, Virginia and was a blue-chip recruit coming out of high school. ==College career== As a freshman, Shane was on a Virginia team that went undefeated and won the NCAA Championship. The championship was the first for both Virginia as well the ACC. Following his sophomore season, Shane was named second-team All-ACC. He was also announced as the ITA Atlantic Region Player to Watch. During his junior year, Shane helped lead Virginia to an NCAA Championship in the team tournament, playing at #1 singles and doubles.

It was rediscovered in a New York City film vault in 2014. The film re-premiered with a new original score at the Rialto Theatre in Tacoma in September 2015 (the same theater where the producers of the film first watched it in 1926). The cast included well-known silent movie actors Tom Santschi, Wanda Hawley, and Gareth Hughes. The film was shot on location in and around the city of Tacoma as well as at the 50,000 square foot production stage built by Weaver in the Titlow Beach area. Many local historic sites are featured in the film, including the Winthrop Hotel, Annie Wright School, the Tacoma Totem Pole, and Thornewood Castle.http://www.eyesofthetotem.com/about.htmlhttp://www.thenewstribune.com/2015/05/24/3806055/eyes- of-the-totem-long-lost-silent.html ==Plot== Mariam Hardy, young daughter Betty and husband Jim live in a log cabin in the desolate and frozen north, where Jim works their mining claim.

He completed his college career for the University of Maryland while earning a bachelor's degree in American Studies. ==High school career== Born in Norwood, Massachusetts, Layman was considered a \\"late bloomer\\" at King Philip Regional High School and didn't even start for his AAU team. Despite his height, he preferred to play on the perimeter. He played AAU basketball for Leo Papile with the Boston Amateur Basketball Club (BABC). As a senior, he averaged 26 points, five blocks, and four assists per game. ESPN rated him the 17th-best small forward nationally and the 3rd-best player in Massachusetts. Layman was selected as the 2012 HockomockSports.com Boys' Basketball Player of the Year. He was also chosen as the Hockomock League's Most Valuable Player for boys' basketball in 2012. ==College career== Layman was recruited by Massachusetts native and then Maryland assistant basketball coach, Scott Spinelli. When he first stepped on the College Park campus, \\"He started 17 games and averaged 5.5 points per game as a freshman. His game initially centered around shooting 3-pointers and he even described himself as a guard. Layman gained attention for his long wavy hair, which he began growing out as a freshman. His hair even got its own Twitter account. Layman improved his averages to 11.7 points and 5.0 rebounds per game as a sophomore. He had 61 3-pointers and 27 blocks. After his sophomore year, Layman embarked on a rigorous personal training program with David Atkins and graduate assistant John Auslander to improve his strength and ballhandling. After breaking his hand in June 2014, Auslander attached Layman to Velcro pulleys to build arm muscle and used a squatting machine that did not require the use of his hands. Layman in 2014 “From the end of his sophomore year to end of his junior year, Jake improved as much as any player I’ve ever coached,” according to Mark Turgeon. Teammates described Layman as a quiet leader who led by example. Layman scored 21 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in a win at Oklahoma State on December 21. He had 23 points and 12 rebounds in a 75-59 win against Michigan State on January 17 and scored the last 10 points for the Terrapins. It resulted in him breaking out of a 5-for-23 shooting slump that spanned two games prior. As a junior, Layman was a Third-team All-Big Ten selection by the media. However, he was only an Honorable Mention All-Big Ten selection by the coaches. He was twice named Big Ten Player of the Week. Layman was nominated for the inaugural Karl Malone Power Forward of the Year Award. Layman led Maryland to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in five years. He finished third on the team in scoring behind Melo Trimble and Dez Wells with 12.5 points per game and led the team in rebounding with 5.8 rebounds per game. Layman shot 47 percent from the field despite enduring a late season slump. After speaking with an NBA advisory committee, Layman decided to return to school for his senior season and forgo a possible second round selection in the 2015 NBA draft. As a senior, he was an Honorable Mention All-Big 10 selection by the coaches and media. Layman averaged 11.6 points and 5.3 rebounds per game, shooting 50 percent from the field and 39.6 percent from three-point range. Layman has drawn comparisons to NBA forward Chandler Parsons. Both players have the size to grab rebounds but also the shooting ability to hit 3-pointers. Of the comparison, Layman noted, “I feel like his game fits a little more in the N.B.A. than in the college game, and that’s what I feel like. I think I’m a guy that doesn’t have to have the ball in his hands all the time to really make an impact. I feel like I could be one of those guys that hangs out in the perimeter and just shoots 3s and slashes to the basket when he needs to.” ==Professional careerPortland Trail Blazers (2016–2019)=== On June 23, 2016, Layman was selected by the Orlando Magic with the 47th overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft. He was subsequently traded to the Portland Trail Blazers on draft night. On July 6, he signed with the Trail Blazers and joined the team for the 2016 NBA Summer League. He made his NBA debut on November 1, 2016, scoring 17 points in eight minutes off the bench in the Trail Blazers' 127-104 loss to the Golden State Warriors. He hit five three-pointers in the game, becoming the first Trail Blazer ever to make five three-pointers in a debut, and finished one shy of the franchise record in a quarter. === Minnesota Timberwolves (2019–present) === On July 8, 2019, Layman was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves as a part of a sign-and-trade deal in exchange for the draft rights to Bojan Dubljević. ==International career== In the summer of 2012, Layman was on the under-18 United States national team that defeated Brazil for the gold medal in the FIBA Americas championship. He played more than expected due to an injury to Sam Dekker. Layman played 12 minutes per game and averaged nearly eight points and four rebounds per game.

According to the National Institute of Statistics of Spain (INE), in 2019 it had 146 inhabitants (86 men and 60 women) in three principal neighborhoods (Fontelo, Fonsá and A Devesa). ==Geography== Aiazo is placed in the south-west of the municipality of Frades (Ordes' shire), 30 km driving from Santiago de Compostela and 50 km driving from Coruña. By the south, Aiazo borders with the Arzúa's shire, by the Tambre river; by the north and the east it borders with the rest of Frades, and by the west with the municipality of Oroso. The relief, characterized by the Maruzo river (in the north) and Tambre river (in the south), over a geological area determined by the schist complex of Ordes, forms a landscape with soft hills.LÓPEZ CARRO, M.R. et al., 2012. Mapa de bosques e aldeas de Aiazo In Aiazo there are agrarian lands and forests around the populated areas. The forests are mostly of eucalyptus and pines in plantations, and Galician typical oak forest, with (oaks, birchs, alders, willows, etc. Another frequent kind of forest in Aiazo is the riverbank forest near the Tambre, Gaiteiro, and Maruzo rivers. Maruzo's riverbank is part of the Río Tambre's ecological network Natura 2000, this protection will be increased in the future to the Tambre's riverbank. In the beginning, Aiazo's population was concentrated in the three principal neighborhoods, born around an aquifer. Historically Fontelo, Fonsá and A Devesa were the most important villages, the three with similar characteristics of terraced houses. To complement the three first settlements, country houses appeared, like Os Pereiros, in A Devesa, or O Casal, in Fontelo, and new settlements grew, like A Torre or A Carballeira. In the late 20th century, many isolated houses appeared, some of them following a ribbon development in the way between Ponte Carreira and Ordes, and other around the primary neighborhoods. Population ageing is a phenomenon occurring in Aiazo, although in the last years tendency is to receiving immigrants, especially because of the 2008 crisis. ==Climate== The climate in Aiazo is oceanic, with frequent rain and soft temperatures, ca. 12 °C annual average. Winters are not very cold, but rainy. Nightly frosts are common, and the snow appears once a year, approximately. Summers are relative dry and warm. ==Demographics== Aiazo has the following neighborhoods : 400px *Fontelo. Around an old and sinuous lane, many old big houses form this neighborhood. *A Igrexa. Born around the Saint Peter's Church (igrexa de San Pedro, in Galician), six houses form this place. Aiazo's principal square is located just there, and on it, the neighbors celebrate some events. *A Devesa. It is formed by many old houses, some of them restored. *Fonsá. Old and new houses coexist here. There is a country mansion here, and a new residential area, too. *A Carballeira. Is a residential area in the north of Fontelo. *Galtar. Formed by four houses in Ghaltar Lane. *Estrada. Is the area where the main street in Aiazo across the village. *A Pedra. It is a private country houses and cowsheds complex. *O Cadro. Two houses near A Pedra. *Liñares. Three new houses in the north of Aiazo. *A Torre. Five houses placed in a crossing, between Fontelo and Fonsá. Fontelo and its contour is the most populated neighborhood in Aiazo, with 88 inhabitants (INE 2012), the second one by population is Fonsá and its contour, with 49 inhabitants and the last one by inhabitants is A Devesa and its contour with 27 inhabitants. In summer, Aiazo's population is increased because of tourists, so some days, Aiazo has 300 persons. This occurs because during all the 20th century, Aiazo was, like other Galician regions, an important emigration dot. So, nowadays there are little communities of people from Aiazo in cities like A Coruña or Vigo, in Galicia, in other cities of Spain and Europe like Barcelona (specially the municipality of Santa Coloma de Gramenet), Bilbao, Madrid, London, Aller, Zurich or Hamburg, and in other cities of the world like Buenos Aires. There are people from Aiazo in countries like France or Portugal, too. So in summer, many emigrated people and their descendants return to Aiazo to spend time in their houses, some of them remain empty the rest of the year. ==History== In Aiazo were found several ruins from the Castros Era, such as the dolmen of Aiazo, Neolithic megalithic tomb, one of the biggest and oldest in Galicia or such as the Medorras castro, a fortified settlement from the Iron Age, additionally, other ruins from indeterminate times were also found in Aiazo. Considering these findings, Aiazo territory has a very old settlement, more than 5,000 years old. Near Aiazo, an ancient Roman goldmine was found, so during the Roman Age, Aiazo was probably populated, too.Catálogo arqueolóxico do Plan Xeral de Ordenación Municipal (PXOM) de Frades. Between 17th and 19th centuries, some mansions and big houses were built in Aiazo, such as a baroque house, still inhabited, in Fontelo, or Casa Fogueteiro, a big baroque house, in the past a mansion, abandoned in the late 20th century and nowadays just an old ruin.Catálogo arquitectónico do Plan Xeral de Ordenación Municipal (PXOM) de Frades During the 19th, Aiazo was incorporated to the new Frades municipality. A journey between Sobrado dos Monxes and Santiago de Compostela crossed Aiazo, a journey that was often transited by friars (in galician, \\"frades\\"), so this is the origin of the neighbor village name, Frades, which later became the name for the whole municipality. The journey lasted two days so friars had to sleep in Aiazo, the halfway point. The Fogueteiro mansion was, until the 19th century, an inn where the friars slept. In 1887 the San Pedro church was built: it is a small baroque building with just one nave and a lateral section for the sacristy, with ashlar and masonry corners.Catálogo de arquitectura relixiosa do Plan Xeral de Ordenación Municipal (PXOM) de Frades During the 20th century, the way to Santiago lost its importance, especially because of the development of new vehicular roads. Aiazo became a common agrarian village that sent a big number of people to the emigration. During the 1950s Aiazo started the re-parcelling works, ended during the 1990s. This was the largest transformation of Aiazo’s landscape in its history. Landscape of Aiazo seen from the neighbor Tambre village Since the 1980s, the social structure of Aiazo became different and as some people returned from the emigration, they built new houses. By this time the Asociación de Veciños de Aiazo, (lately Asociación de Veciños Os Pasos de Aiazo) –a neighborhood association became very important. This group of people improved Aiazo social life in an extraordinary way. A historic day in Aiazo is 23 July, since in this day of 1994 the Os Pasos de Aiazo recreational area was set up by this association. Os Pasos became so important that Aiazo celebrated different events by using this space, highlighting the Festa dos Pasos (Os Pasos Festival), since 1994, or the Ruta de Senderismo day (a hiking event) since 1998. In January 2005 Aiazo celebrated the first edition of the Festa da Merenda (Merenda Festival), devised by some influential women in the neighborhood association, that quickly became the most important gastronomic festival in Frades and one of the most important in all Galicia, exceeding 8,000 visitors at the 2015 edition. ==Tourism== Aiazo has three interesting places for visitors: * A dolmen found in the 1990s, demolished and placed in the Trasgaltar woods. Its destruction and abandonment was denounced by some collectives like the Associaçom Cultural Obradoiro da História, who reported the importance of the archeological site to the community. * A hiking route next to the Tambre river, communicated with other Frades villages. * A recreational area next to the Tambre River, very popular during the summer. Called Os Pasos was set up in 1994. Aiazo celebrates a festival every year in commemoration of its establishment. Since 1994 Os Pasos was improved until it became a symbol of identity for Aiazo and Frades people and an important leisure point for many people in the Santiago de Compostela urban area. Other interesting places in Aiazo are the Peneda da Hedra, a cave where a shoemaker lived,PAZOS, M. e PEREIRO, D., 2004. Concello de Oroso. Guía histórica en imaxes. Asociazón cultural Obradoiro da História. 1ª ed. or the different mills in the Maruzo river, some of them well preserved, like the Mestas mill. ==Economy== Aiazo is a residential area characterized by the commuting to A Coruña, Santiago and other Galician towns such as Ordes. Agrarian activities in Aiazo are not as important as in other Frades areas, however A Pedra livestock is an exception here. Aiazo is the home of some SMEs of the service sector and of one of the biggest forestry companies in Spain named Eucalyptus Plus SL. ==Festivals and culture== Aiazo celebrates many religious, cultural and gastronomic festivals. Highlights: * Merenda Festival; gastronomic (Festa da Merenda). Every Holy Week, volunteer neighbors cook merendas, a typical Aiazo’s pancake. People can taste it for free while enjoying traditional music and, in the evening, a band plays until dawn. This is the most important event in Aiazo and in the whole of Frades. * San Pedro; religious annual party, celebrated in June. * Os Pasos Festival; celebrated once a year, a Saturday near 23 July; Aiazo's neighbors hold a lunch. * A Ruta; Every year in the first week of August, the Aiazo community goes hiking with other people to discover the Aiazo forests and then they enjoy a barbecue and popular games in Os Pasos.Santiago y Comarca http://www.santiagoycomarca.es/2011/08/frades- medio-cento-de-vecinos-e-vecinas.html * San Roque; an annual religious party celebrated in August. * Magosto; fall gastronomic festival. Volunteer neighbors cook typical autumn products and people taste it for free in the Aiazo Civic Centre (placed in A Carballeira). ==Sarillo de Aiazo== Sarillo de Aiazo is Aiazo’s Galician folk music group.

It served the MBTA's Orange Line. It opened in 1919 as an extension of the Charlestown Elevated, and served as its northern terminus until the Elevated was closed and demolished in 1975, when it was replaced by the Haymarket North Extension. ==Construction and history== Streetcar platforms next to the inbound platform (not visible, at left) at Everett in 1931 In the 1910s and 1920s, the Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) had plans to extend the Charlestown Elevated to Malden, and the southern portion of this extension, including a drawbridge over the Mystic River, was built in the late 1910s. Everett station was opened in an isolated industrial area just north of the river crossing on March 15, 1919. Intended to be temporary and to be used only until full service to Malden was implemented, it was constructed of wood like a house rather than a permanent transit station. The light-duty construction style of this station was unique on the Elevated. Due to opposition from Malden residents who preferred a tunnel due to the noise and vibration of the planned elevated line, the Malden extension was not built and Everett remained the terminus. Although Everett thus became a semi-permanent station, it was never rebuilt from its \\"clapboard house\\" configuration, and began to look increasingly shabby as the years went by, acquiring a reputation to that effect among riders of the Elevated. On March 30, 1963, the remaining trackless trolley lines feeding into Everett were replaced with diesel buses. This allowed the somewhat isolated station to be closed on nights and Sundays to improve passenger security and comfort, during which times the buses were simply extended to Sullivan Square. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, plans to reroute the Orange Line were implemented, culminating in the building of the Haymarket North Extension. The Haymarket North Extension rerouted the Orange Line into a new tunnel under the Charles River and from there followed the Haverhill Line north through Malden, somewhat to the west of the Charlestown Elevated's then-existing and previously-planned route. The Charlestown Elevated was closed on April 4, 1975, and the first section of the Haymarket North Extension was opened three days later. Since then, all transit service to the city of Everett has consisted of buses terminating at Sullivan Square, Wellington, Malden Center, or Wood Island stations. ==ReferencesExternal links== *An image of the station on its last day of operation Category:Orange Line (MBTA) stations Category:Former MBTA stations in Massachusetts Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1919 Category:Railway stations closed in 1975 Category:1919 establishments in Massachusetts ","title":"Everett station (MBTA)"},{"id":"46799197","text":"Tiny TV was a brand name used by Turner Broadcasting for a slate of international programming blocks that targeted preschool-age children.

The album was released on November 24, 2014 through Profound Lore Records. The CD version of the album was also packaged with a five-song, 35-minute bonus disc titled Sister Fawn that was described as an \\"extension\\" of Full of Hell & Merzbow; it was later released in a digital format as well. The album received mixed reviews from music critics, with many praising the collaboration between the two artists, however some noted that Merzbow's part in the album was minimal, and only apparent and successful on the album's two longer tracks toward the end: \\"High Fells\\" and \\"Ljudet Av Gud\\". ==Background and recording== At a live performance in New York headlined by Phobia, the members of Full of Hell, who were opening at the show, ran into Merzbow's live drummer Balázs Pándi, who was there to see Phobia. After the show, the band kept in contact with Pándi, who would send them albums he thought they should listen to; the relationship evolved into Pándi becoming their indirect contact with Merzbow frontman Akita Masami, which continued throughout the creation of Full of Hell & Merzbow. Full of Hell vocalist Dylan Walker said, \\"The communication was definitely minimal with Masami. I don't think he speaks a lot of English, so I think Balázs [Pándi] has been really helpful for him.\\" Full of Hell asked Pándi if they could have permission from Masami to release a shirt paying tribute to the cover art of Merzbow's 1996 album Pulse Demon. In Masami's response, he proposed the idea of doing a split album, but later changed his mind and decided he wanted to do a collaboration album instead. Merzbow sent the members of Full of Hell approximately 45 minutes of material for them to do with what they saw fit, and had very little contact with Masami during the writing and recording process. Knowing that some fans and critics wouldn't like the finished product, Full of Hell focused their attention on making an album Masami and Balázs would be proud of, and ultimately spent over a year working with the material. Walker said he specifically was inspired how Jamie Saft used Merzbow's source material on his 2006 album Merzdub. On Saft's album, Walker said: \\"it was so soothing, and it was so cool that he'd be able to warp Merzbow into this new sonic territory; it was a dub album, but like a dub album in space. We hoped that we could achieve something similar by warping Merzbow into our kind of sound. And Masami was really happy with how it turned out so, y'know, naysayers be damned!\\" Because of the varying frequencies present in the source material that Masami sent Full of Hell, the band decided to \\"map out\\" how they wanted to use it all. Ultimately, they decided to make two separate releases that put different levels of focus on either of the two contributors to the project. For the first disc, Full of Hell & Merzbow, weighted the focus as: \\"70% Full of Hell, and 30% Merzbow record, so much like a regular Full of Hell record with noise.\\" Originally only available with the CD release of the album, the band included a \\"second CD hidden within the layout\\" of the album's packaging titled Sister Fawn, which flipped the approximate weighted ratios, and as a result saw: \\"70% Merzbow and 30% Full of Hell. We did a lot writing in the studio for the second CD, it has kind of a Tribes of Neurot feel for the second CD.\\" In addition to collaborating with Merzbow, Full of Hell & Merzbow also features Kevin Morris on horns, and contains excerpts from William Rounseville Alger's novel The Solitudes of Nature and of Man: Or, The Loneliness of Human Life on the tracks \\"Raise Thee, Great Wall, Bloodied and Terrible\\" and \\"Ljudet Av Gud.\\" ==Reception== Full of Hell & Merzbow was met with mixed reviews from music critics. Writing for Exclaim!, critic Michael Rancic praised the album and scored it with an eight-out-of-ten rating. On the collaboration between the two artists, Rancic said: \\"The end result finds Full of Hell's explosive, breakneck powerviolence stitched together by Masami's squalls of squelches. Though Masami's contributions sound more like black holes than any kind of connective tissue, they're the dark matter that connects each song.\\" However, critics Joseph Rowan of Drowned in Sound and Andy O'Connor of Pitchfork were less impressed with the album and gave it a five and five-and-a-half (both out of ten) respectively, citing too little of Merzbow's sound an influence as a major factor. Rowan said Merzbow, \\"seems barely present on the heavy tracks and only on two-and-a-half songs could I definitely point to what I presumed was his involvement,\\" and O'Connor described the collaboration as \\"frustrating because it falls short of its goals, in part due to Merzbow's too-reduced role and that Full of Hell don't make up for the missing space.\\" While most reviewers were dissatisfied with the lack of Masami's influence on Full of Hell & Merzbow, most critics did praise the album's longer tracks toward the end of the album (\\"High Fells\\" and \\"Ljudet Av Gud\\") that more noticeably featured Masami's signature noise. Rancic described these tracks as being \\"more abstract territory\\" and that ultimately \\"it's a good look for the band, one that hopefully becomes an approach they deploy again on future records.\\" Rowan compared \\"High Fells\\" to Sunn O)))'s song \\"Alice\\" from their 2009 album Monoliths & Dimensions, describing it as \\"the best thing on the album,\\" and also praised the following track \\"Ljudet Av Gud\\" as being: \\"much more like what I was expecting from the album.\\" O'Connor noted praised the doomy \\"High Fells\\" for \\"giving Merzbow more room to cast a wide shadow\\" and Full of Hell's restraint on \\"Ljudet Av Gud\\" for its \\"booming floor toms and drifting noise undercurrents.\\" O'Connor also praised Full of Hell & Merzbow's bonus CD Sister Fawn, describing it as a \\"much more satisfying listen than the actual record.\\" ==Track listingsFull of Hell & Merzbow=Sister Fawn=Personnel== Personnel adapted from CD liner notes. ===Full of Hell=== * David Bland – drums * Brandon Brown – bass, vocals * Spencer Hazard – guitar, vocals, percussion, electronics * Dylan Walker – vocals, electronics, percussion ===Additional musicians=== * Masami Akita (Merzbow) – electronics * Kevin Morris – horns ===Recording and artwork=== * Kevin Bernsten – recording at Developing Nations * Brad Boatright – mastering at Audio Siege * Mark McCoy – artwork, layout ===Sister Fawn personnel=== * Masami Akita (Merzbow) – electronics, vocals, percussion, recording * Spencer Hazard – electronics, vocals, percussion, recording * Dylan Walker – electronics, vocals, percussion, recording ==ReferencesExternal links== * Full of Hell & Merzbow on Bandcamp * Sister Fawn on Bandcamp * Mark McCoy — official website of the album's cover artist Category:2014 albums Category:Merzbow albums Category:Profound Lore Records albums Category:Full of Hell (band) albums Category:Collaborative albums ","title":"Full of Hell &amp; Merzbow"},{"id":"46799218","text":"Rear-Admiral John Blankett, (c. 1740 - 14 July 1801) was a Royal Navy officer of the late eighteenth century who served in three major wars, but was best known for his service in the Red Sea during the late stages French Revolutionary Wars when he blocked French ambitions in the Indian Ocean. ==Life== Blankett was born in approximately 1740 and by 1758 was a midshipman in the Royal Navy, serving in HMS Somerset at the Siege of Louisbourg and the capture of Quebec. In 1761 he wrote a report on the possibility of a Northwest Passage and was promoted to lieutenant. Shortly afterwards he was convicted of murder at Gibraltar and sentenced to death, but was later reprieved. In 1763 he traveled to Russia to obtain intelligence about the recent Russian exploration of the northern Pacific coast.Blankett, John, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton and Clive Wilkinson, (subscription required), Retrieved 9 June 2015 In the early 1770s Blankett was again in Russia in preparation for an exploration mission to the Pacific, although this was later cancelled by Lord Sandwich. The aftermath of this caused Blankett to openly associate with Sandwich's political enemies, particularly Lord Shelburne, whom he supplied with naval information for use against Sandwich in Parliament. During the American Revolutionary War Blankett served on HMS Victory and then commanded HMS Nymph and HMS Rippon in the Caribbean, although his services were no longer required after 1780. In 1784 after the end of the war Blankett was recalled to service in command of HMS Thetis in the Mediterranean, receiving an honour from King Ferdinand of Sicily. In 1790 he was appointed to HMS Leopard, escorting a convoy to China and the commanded HMS America on an operation to the Cape of Good Hope during the French Revolutionary Wars. In 1795 he participated in the invasion and capture of the Dutch Cape Colony. In 1798 he was given an independent command in Leopard, tasked with preventing the use of the Red Sea by the French, who had invaded Egypt earlier in the year under General Napoleon Bonaparte. With growing bitterness he retained this uneventful command for three years, the presence of his force dissuading the French from pursuing operations in the region. In 1801, his health broken by the heat and conditions in the Red Sea, he died on Leopard at Mocha on the Arabian Peninsula. In life, Blankett was noted for both his linguistic prowess and his bad temper. ==Notes== Category:1740s births Category:1801 deaths Category:Royal Navy personnel of the American Revolutionary War Category:Royal Navy personnel of the French Revolutionary Wars ","title":"John Blankett"},{"id":"46799231","text":"Louis II Frederick Charles Eginhard, Count of Erbach-Fürstenau (12 May 1728 – 16 January 1794), was a member of the German House of Erbach who held the fiefs of Fürstenau, Michelstadt and Breuberg.

His career spanned five decades, during which he appeared in over 50 films, more than half of them features, as well as film shorts, serials, and even one television appearance. He rose to stardom in such films as Girls Gone Wild and Chasing Through Europe, prior to expanding his business interests by creating a talent agency, and a popular upscale club in Hollywood. After being introduced to music by Guy Lombardo, he established his own band, \\"The Man with the Band from Movieland\\", which played for over twenty years. When he dissolved the band in 1961, he opened a haberdashery in Biloxi, Mississippi. He met his first wife, Sue Carol, while working on a film, and the two had a daughter, actress Carol Lee Ladd. While his first marriage was short-lived, his second marriage to Martha Burnett lasted over thirty years, until his death from cancer in 1973. ==Early life and family== Nick Stuart and wife Sue Carol in 1930 Stuart was born Niculae Pratza on April 10, 1904, in Abrud (Abrudbánya), Transylvania, then part of Austria-Hungary. He emigrated to the United States as a child in 1913, growing up in Dayton, Ohio. Sue Carol, with her new baby, Carol Lee Stuart was married twice. The first time was to Sue Carol on November 28, 1929; the two had a child, actress Carol Lee Ladd (born July 18, 1932). The \\"Lee\\" in Carol Lee was named for Carol's best friend, Dixie Lee, the wife of Bing Crosby. Initially, the couple attempted to hide their marriage from the public, with the help of the Crosbys. Stuart would make public appearances with Dixie Lee, while Bing Crosby would feign romantic interest with Sue Carol in public. While on a personal appearances tour in 1931, the couple had $35,000 of jewelry stolen. The jewelry was taken from their parked car on Michigan Avenue in Chicago. Less than a year after the birth of their child, reports began to circulate that their marriage was in trouble. By August 1933 Stuart and Carol were estranged and living separate lives, and divorced in 1934. After the divorce, Stuart was romantically linked with several other women, including nightclub singer Bobbe Arnst (recently divorced from Johnny Weissmuller), and Dorothy Lee. ==CareerFilm=== In the mid-1920s Nick Prata (as he was then known) began working in the film industry, doing odd jobs around the set for Fox Film, such as prop boy, script clerk, and assistant cameraman. While working as an assistant on Raoul Walsh's What Price Glory? in 1926, Prata was given a screen test, after which his name was changed to Nick Stuart. Shortly after, he became Howard Hawks's personal assistant. He appeared in minor roles in two film shorts, before being given an opportunity to act in a featured role by Hawks, in 1927's, The Cradle Snatchers. After the success of The Cradle Snatchers, Stuart would star in several shorts, many of which again paired him with his Snatchers co-star, Sally Phipps, which included Gentlemen Prefer Scotch, and Cupid and the Clock (based on a short story by O. Henry). The two would star in Stuart's next three films in 1927 and 1928: High School Hero, Why Sailors Go Wrong, and News Parade. Stuart's next role was that of Sandy, starring alongside Victor McLaglen in William K. Howard's The River Pirate in 1928. Stuart and Sue Carol had been linked together romantically since early in 1928, and would co-star in Stuart's next project, Girls Gone Wild. Sue Carol greeting Nick Stuart at Union Station in Los Angeles, after his return from location filming in Europe for Chasing Through Europe. Stuart and Phipps appeared together in his next film, although Phipps was in a secondary role. Stuart's co-star in 1929's Joy Street, was Lois Moran, who had also been his love interest in The River Pirate. Stuart and Phipps were again slated to co- star in Chasing Through Europe, the sequel to their successful film, News Parade. However, she was replaced by June Collyer in July 1928, who was replaced in turn by Sue Carol in September. Stuart and Carol appeared in several films together over the next few years, including 1933's Secret Sinners. ===Agency days=== In 1933 Stuart, along with David Kay, opened an agency in Hollywood, which represented actors, writers, and directors. Later that year, their company signed an agreement with the Canadian film company, British Commonwealth Productions, to cast all of their films. The first film they cast was The Crimson West (released in the United States as Fighting Playboy), which would be the first full-length talking film produced in Canada. The following year, he became the founder of the Bath and Tennis Club in Hollywood. The club was modeled on upscale clubs in the east, particularly those in Palm Beach and Long Island, New York, and included recreational facilities for tennis, squash, swimming, badminton, and handball. ===Entrance into music and later acting career=== In the midst of his film career, after Guy Lombardo got him interested in music, Stuart began his own big band, and became known as \\"The Man with the Band from Movieland\\". Stuart had become friendly with Lombardo when he and his wife, Carol, had helped Lombardo's brother adopt a child in 1932. By 1937, Stuart's band had achieved a modicum of fame, and had appeared in several film shorts, including 1938's Twenty Girls and a Band. After the creation of his band, Stuart would only sporadically appear in films over the next 20 years. In the 1940s, he appeared in two of the Bowery Boys films, starring Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall, Mr. Muggs Steps Out (1943), and Pride of the Bowery (1946). Stuart's last starring role would be in the 1946 film, Gunsmoke. From 1946 through 1963 Stuart would appear in only four more films, although he appeared in several film serials, such as The Lost Planet (1953), Blackhawk: Fearless Champion of Freedom (1952), and King of the Congo (1952). Stuart's one and only television appearance came in a featured role in the final episode of Navy Log, which aired on September 11, 1958. In the 1960s, he would make his final appearance in a small role in Sydney Pollack's drama This Property Is Condemned, starring Natalie Wood, Robert Redford, and Charles Bronson. ==Later life and death== Stuart married Martha Burnett in 1942, with whom he remained married until his death in 1973. Stuart dissolved his band in 1961, after which he opened a haberdashery in Biloxi, Mississippi, located in the Broadwater Beach Hotel. Stuart died from cancer on April 7, 1973 in Biloxi, Mississippi. He was buried in Southern Memorial Park in Biloxi, where his wife would be buried next to him upon her death in 1991. ==Filmography== (Per AFI database, and imdb.com.

After a year as a research assistant he joined the faculty of the University of Wisconsin as an instructor and subsequently assistant professor before moving to the Russell Sage Foundation.http://www.srcd.org/sites/default/files/documents/brim_orville_gilbert_interview.pdf During a two-week leave from the Army Air Corps in 1944, Lieutenant Brim was introduced to Kathleen Jane Vigneron. Soon after his leave was up the two were married—a union that lasted almost 60 years and produced four children (John Gilbert, Scott Whittier, Margaret Lowry and Sarah Morgan).http://srcd.org/sites/default/files/documents/brim_orville_gilbert_cv.pdf In 1985, the Brims settled in Vero Beach, Florida, spending their summers at Watch Hill, Rhode Island, and later, Old Greenwich, Connecticut. Kathy Brim died in 2003. ==Work== Dr. Brim joined the Russell Sage Foundation of New York City in 1955 and was named president in 1964.Russell Sage Foundation. (2007). Celebrating 100 Years of Social Science Research: Russell Sage Foundation 1907-2007. Pg 4. He led the foundation's successful effort to encourage the law schools at leading universities to include courses in social science research in their curricula—for example, by accompanying courses in criminal law with courses in crime and its origins. The concept was later extended to schools of medicine and journalism. In 1974, Dr. Brim was appointed president of the Foundation for Child Development.http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/1974/ASA.04.1974.pdf During his twelve-year tenure he expanded the foundation's field of inquiry and support, which had been centered on welfare programs for children, to include study of their social and psychological development. Under his leadership, the first National Survey of Children was undertaken, in 1976, and three years later he established through the foundation a new, not-for-profit organization, Child Trends, in Washington, D.C.http://www.childtrends.org/wp- content/uploads/2013/04/da3622h1258.pdf Since then, Child Trends has become the nation's leading repository and clearinghouse of past and current information about America's children, an essential resource for policymakers and scholars alike. After leaving the Foundation for Child Development in 1985, Dr. Brim wrote the first of his two books exploring widely known but little-studied aspects of human behavior. Ambition: How We Manage Success and Failure Throughout Our Lives, Brim, O. G. (1992). Ambition: How we manage success and failure throughout our lives. New York: BasicBooks. http://www.thirteen.org/openmind-archive/aging/adaptand-succeed/ was published in 1992. It has since been reprinted and translated into several languages. His second book, Look at Me!: The Fame Motive from Childhood to Death, Brim, O. G. (2009). Look at me!: The fame motive from childhood to death. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press. examines the desire to be famous in people of different ages, backgrounds and social status, and how succeeding or failing to achieve fame affected their lives, both outwardly and inwardly. It was published in 2009. In 1989, The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation asked Dr. Brim to lead the Foundation's Research Network on Successful Midlife Development, which to this day remains the most thorough and extensive examination of middle age ever carried out. Over the next ten years, the Network conducted dozens of separate studies of midlife drawn from interviews of more than 7,000 Americans of both sexes, aged 25 to 74. The basic findings, which received nationwide attention when announced in early 1999, were that Americans tend to feel younger than they really are; that, for most, \\"midlife crisis\\" is a myth, and midlife itself—especially the years 40 to 60—is a time of good health, psychic equanimity, productive activity and satisfying personal and community relationships. In summarizing the findings, Dr. Brim declared, \\"On balance, the sense we all have is that midlife is the best place to be.\\" The complete findings of the MacArthur project appeared in 2004 in How Healthy Are We\\" A National Study of Well-Being at Midlife,Brim, O. G., Ryff, C. D., & Kessler, R. C. (2004). How healthy are we?: A national study of well- being at midlife. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. a book edited by Dr. Brim with Carol D. Ryff and Ronald C. Kessler. A follow-up study of the original 7,000 respondents to the original network survey is currently in progress at the University of Wisconsin. == Awards == * Society for the Study of Human Development Award for Distinguished Career Contributions to the Scientific Study of Life Span Development, 2005.Sherrod, Lonnie. \\"A Tribute to Orville Gilbert Brim.\\" Research in Human Development 6.4 (2009): 197-98.
