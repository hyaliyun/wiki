He made his MLB debut in 2015. Career Minor leagues Ure√±a pitching for the New Orleans Zephyrs in 2016 Ure√±a grew up in the Dominican Republic. The Marlins signed him on August 28, 2009, and he played for two seasons with the Dominican Summer League Marlins. In 2011, he played in short season Single-A with the Jamestown Jammers, posting a 4.33 ERA in 15 starts. In 2012, he advanced to full-season Single-A, posting a 3.38 ERA in 138.1 innings with the Greensboro Grasshoppers. In 2013, he played in high Single-A with the Jupiter Hammerheads, pitching 149.2 innings with a 3.73 ERA. In 2014, he amassed a record of 13-8, pitching 162 innings with 121 strikeouts and a 3.33 ERA. Ure√±a began the 2015 season with the New Orleans Zephyrs of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. Miami Marlins Ure√±a was called up to the majors for the first time on April 13, 2015 to replace David Phelps. In his first major league start on May 26, 2015, against the Pittsburgh Pirates, he gave up five runs in innings and took the 5‚Äì1 loss. In 20 games (9 starts) with the Marlins in 2015, Ure√±a finished with a 1‚Äì5 record and a 5.25 ERA. In 2016, Ure√±a split time starting and in the bullpen, finishing the year with a 4‚Äì9 record and a 6.13 ERA in 28 games (12 starts). In 2017, Ure√±a improved, appearing in 34 games (28 starts) with a 14‚Äì7 record, and a 3.82 ERA. He also hit a league-leading 14 batsmen with pitches. Ure√±a was named the Opening Day starter for 2018. On Opening Day against the Chicago Cubs on March 29, 2018, Ure√±a did not fare well as he surrendered a home run by Ian Happ on the first pitch he threw. He allowed five runs altogether in 4+ innings as the Marlins lost 4‚Äì8. Ure√±a started 16 games for the Marlins before landing on the disabled list with a shoulder injury. On August 15, 2018, he was ejected from a game against the Atlanta Braves after hitting Ronald Acu√±a Jr. on the elbow with the first pitch of the game, which led to the Braves' and Marlins' benches clearing. Acu√±a had hit a home run in his previous five games. Ure√±a received a six-game suspension for his role in the altercation. In his next start, Ure√±a threw a complete game against the Washington Nationals, giving up one run on two hits while striking out four batters. He ended the season going 6‚Äì0 in his final seven starts to go along with a 1.80 ERA. By posting a 3.82 ERA in 2017 and a 3.98 ERA in 2018, Ure√±a became just the sixth starting pitcher in Marlins history to post a sub-4.00 ERA in consecutive seasons, joining Pat Rapp, Kevin Brown, Dontrelle Willis, Josh Johnson, and An√≠bal S√°nchez. In 2019, Ure√±a became the eighth pitcher in Marlins history to make consecutive Opening Day starts. After beginning the season 0‚Äì3, he tossed quality starts in eight of his next nine outings, going 4‚Äì3 with a 2.95 ERA over that span. Following a start against the Atlanta Braves on June 7, 2019, Ure√±a was placed on the injured list with a herniated disc in his lower back. At the time of his injury, he was tied for twelfth in the MLB with eight quality starts. Pitching style According to a scouting report prepared for MLB's 2014 midseason prospect rankings, the eighth-ranked Ure√±a had \\"an above- average fastball that can touch the mid 90s\\", a change-up, and a breaking ball that is \\"a combination of a slider and a curve\\". He was said to have \\"above- average command\\". However, Ure√±a's command of the ball has dipped significantly since the start of the 2017 season with ESPN writers recognizing \\"a history of control problems,\\" noting that in 2017, he hit 14 batters in 2017, tying in the MLB for hit batters, and as of hitting Ronald Acu√±a Jr. in 2018, had tied for second in the National League, hitting 10 batters.

It has been described as a phenomenon in the psychology of human error, such that a person may inadvertently perform one action while intending to do another. The term \\"slips and capture\\" became more widely known in the early 21st century in the United States, after being referred to by law enforcement in two prominent fatal police shooting cases in 2009 and 2015. In both cases, the police officer claimed to have shot a suspect while intending to use a Taser. Background and history The concept of \\"slips and capture\\" has been studied in the psychology of human error, and efforts to prevent error. It was thoroughly described in 1990 by James Reason. The concept has been addressed in efforts to improve business, including computer and program design, and medical practices in order to avoid preventable error. Both terms are used in error terminology: slips are defined as \\"errors in the performance of skill- based behaviors, typically when our attention is diverted;\\" and capture refers to \\"a type of slip where a more frequent and more practiced behavior takes place when a similar, but less familiar, action was intended.\\"  Shooting of Oscar Grant  Early on New Year's Day of 2009, Oscar Grant III was fatally shot by Bay Area Rapid Transit officer Johannes Mehserle, who was detaining the young man with others after a reported fight on the train. At his bail hearing in late January 2009, Mehserle said that he had intended to use his Taser, but inadvertently grabbed his pistol instead. In 2010 a jury convicted Mehserle of involuntary manslaughter, acquitting him of charges of voluntary manslaughter. The phrase \\"slips and capture\\" was used by Bill Lewinski in 2009, a consultant in police use of force who was part of Mehserle's defense team. Lewinski was reported by the Wall Street Journal to have a doctorate in psychology from Union Institute & University, an online college. His company, Force Science Institute, specializes in consulting to police departments. Its website advertises: \\"We save lives and reputations.\\" Lewinski published a newsletter article on the \\"Slips and Capture\\" theory in his \\"Force Science News #154\\" after he began work on the defense of Mehserle.  Shooting of Eric Courtney Harris  44-year-old Eric Courtney Harris was shot to death April 2, 2015, by Tulsa city police during an undercover sting in Tulsa, Oklahoma. As Harris was being subdued, Tulsa County Reserve Deputy Robert Charles \\"Bob\\" Bates, 73, fatally shot Harris in the back, according to the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office. Bates used the concept of \\"slips and capture\\" in his defense, saying that he had intended to use his Taser on Harris.

It stars Ali Cobrin playing a woman in an X-rated reality web series and Slaine as the psychopath who stalks her.  Plot  In Rehobeth, Alabama, 1988, two little girls trick an overweight child they have nicknamed \\"Loverboy\\" into dropping his pants and preparing for a kiss, only to tease and humiliate him. When one of the girls rides home alone afterwards, Loverboy knocks her from her bicycle and throws her off a bridge, making the girl's death look like an accident. In the present day, struggling to pay her way through school following the death of her father, college coed Kylie Atkins is recruited by entrepreneur Gary Preston to join his online pornography venture Girl House. Girl House allows its users to watch the ladies living inside the house 24/7 via 50 camera feeds. The girls perform stripteases and regular daily activities with the option of performing sexual acts on camera for additional money. Gary assures Kylie that Girl House's technology cannot be hacked and that the house's secret location is untraceable. He brings Kylie to the house and introduces her to Steve, who shares security guard duties with Big Mike. Kylie also meets fellow Girl House residents Kat, Devon, Janet, Heather, and Mia. Kylie performs her first striptease online and captures the attention of Loverboy, who watches from his basement in Atlanta and is known as a Girl House regular. Also watching are Alex and his college roommate Ben Stanley, who recognizes Kylie as the girl he has had a crush on since kindergarten. Having been banned for her heroin addiction, former Girl House performer Anna sneaks back into the house and convinces Gary to give her another try. Ben and Kylie begin a relationship. Kylie has a private chat session with Loverboy. He hacks into the computer system and surprises Kylie by sending her a picture of his face. Anna later finds the picture while snooping on Kylie's laptop. Later, Ben admits to Kylie that he knows about her involvement with Girl House. However, they talk through the issue and continue their relationship. Loverboy angers the other women in Girl House by continually asking for Kylie when she is not there. The girls begin making fun of him for being pathetic. Loverboy notices his picture on the bulletin board inside Girl House with a handwritten caption that reads, \\"What a stud.\\" Kylie comes home and takes down the picture as soon as she sees it. Eventually, Loverboy snaps. He hacks into Girl House's system, dons a mask, and breaks into the building housing Girl House's servers, where he kills the website's technical team. Loverboy straps Gary to a chair and stabs him several times. Slowly dying from blood loss, Gary is forced to watch through the monitors as Loverboy travels to the house's location and continues his rampage. Loverboy kills Steve at the security gatehouse. He then strangles Anna with a piece of rope inside the house's off-camera room. From his dorm room, Alex watches as Loverboy mutilates Devon during a private dance. Alex shows Ben the carnage taking place live at Girl House. Ben tries texting a warning to Kylie but, just as she returns to Girl House, Loverboy jams incoming and outgoing communications. Oblivious to what is going on inside the house, Kylie retires to her room. Ben instructs Alex to try hacking into Girl House to find its address while he goes in search of other ways to locate Kylie. Meanwhile, Loverboy kills Heather and her boyfriend while they are having sex. Janet investigates the commotion and catches Loverboy in the act of severing the boyfriend's head; Loverboy throws her over an upstairs railing. She survives, but breaks her legs in the fall. Next, Loverboy locks Mia in the sauna room. She smashes a lump of coal through the door and escapes to the pool outside, but there Loverboy kills her with a sledgehammer. Gary eventually dies from blood loss while watching the horror unfold onscreen at the technical facility. Kylie realizes the danger when she spots Loverboy at the pool from her window. Loverboy electronically locks Kylie inside the house. Janet attacks him, but is unsuccessful and gets stabbed in the head. Kylie finds Kat and tries to hide in her bedroom. Loverboy breaks in and corners Kylie, who now recognizes him. Kat seemingly knocks Loverboy unconscious with his crowbar and goes for help while Kylie tries to find Devon. Kat meets Big Mike at the front door, but Loverboy recovers in time to kill them both. Kylie is able to find Devon and tells her to stay in her bedroom while she searches for help. Distraught over her disfigured face and severed fingers, Devon suffocates herself with a plastic bag. At the same time, Ben finds Kylie's friend Liz Owens at Selby College and together they try to find out where Kylie is. Ben helps the police find an address for Girl House, but their tactical team ends up storming the technical facility instead. Alex eventually hacks into Girl House's ISP and determines the house's real address. Ben races there with Liz. Loverboy chases Kylie throughout the house. She hides in the utility room and shuts off all of the cameras. She then lures Loverboy to a darkened basement where she uses a video camera's night vision to help her stab him in the stomach with a pool stick. Injured, Loverboy overpowers and begins to strangle her, but she ends up clubbing him to death with the camera. She runs outside, where Ben and Liz show up with the police and a news crew following behind. The film ends with Kylie breathing deeply and the screen cuts to black.

After realizing that he had not seen themes of pornography and privacy explored in a slasher film, he recruited Gordon to write the script. The story was always important to Mathews, and he said that he was very enthused with the project when he read Gordon's script. Though it was his first film, Matthews said that his experiences with previous productions had been collaborative enough that it seemed like a natural step for him. Jon Knautz initially co-directed the film, but Knautz got an offer to direct another project. Matthews encouraged him to take the opportunity and finished directing the film himself. Matthews was influenced by Halloween and used that film's structure as a guide. He said that the film serves as a cautionary tale about over-sharing on social media. Slaine said that the mask he wore was very uncomfortable, and it could only be put on or taken off with help. As a result, the mask had to stay on for extended periods during shooting. Slaine attempted to channel events from his own life into his performance to heighten the emotional impact and make his character more sympathetic. Cobrin said that she experienced some trepidation about her role, but her fondness for slasher films made it easier. Shooting took place in Kanata, Ontario.  Release  Girl House played at the Ottawa International Film Festival on October 16, 2014. Lakeshore Records released the soundtrack by tomandandy on February 10, 2015, and Entertainment One released the film to video on demand on February 13, 2015.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 73% of 11 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.58/10. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"Director Trevor Matthews stages the violent mayhem with admirable profiency, and the film's target audience is bound to come away reasonably satisfied, if not fully satiated.\\" Maitland McDonagh of Film Journal International described it as a \\"formulaic but slickly executed thriller that should entertain undemanding genre buffs\\". Michael Gingold of Fangoria rated it 2/4 stars and wrote of the film's satiric content, \\"Too often, though, the moviemakers fall back on grisly, gamy sensationalism.\\" Pat Torfe of Bloody Disgusting rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"Boasting some strong acting from almost everyone involved, coupled with a scary antagonist and some genuinely brutal moments that gorehounds will love, Girl House is definitely one of the stronger slasher films I've recently seen.\\" Scott Hallam of Dread Central rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"For a directorial debut, Trevor Matthews does a fantastic job. The movie is slick looking, nicely paced, and keeps the audience's attention at all times.\\" Matt Donato of We Got This Covered rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, \\"Girlhouse is just another nudie horror flick at first glance, but a strong finale finishes things off with a bloody, satisfying moneyshot.\\" Brian Formo of IGN rated it 7/10 stars and wrote, \\"It's an imperfect debut, but it shows promise.\\"  References   External links  * * * Category:2014 films Category:2014 horror films Category:2014 independent films Category:2010s slasher films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian independent films Category:Canadian slasher films Category:English-language films Category:Erotic horror films Category:Erotic slasher films Category:Films about mass murder Category:Films about pornography Category:Films about psychopaths Category:Films set in Alabama Category:Films shot in Ontario Category:Films scored by Tomandandy Category:2014 directorial debut films ","title":"Girl House"},{"id":"46402202","text":"The 2015 Miami Hurricanes football team (variously \\"Miami\\", \\"The U\\", \\"UM\\", \\"'Canes\\") represented the University of Miami during the 2015 NCAA Division I FBS football season.

It was opened from Clyde to Subiaco (later renamed Camellia) in January 1885, then by means of the construction of a bridge across the Parramatta River, to Carlingford in April 1896. It closed on 5 January 2020 with much of the line to be converted to light rail as part of the Parramatta Light Rail network, while a short section of the line was retained for use by Sydney Trains. Line description The Carlingford line branched off the Western line at Clyde heading north and crossing Parramatta Road via a level crossing, before passing under the M4 Western Motorway to Rosehill station. It was a double track line to this point. Immediately south of Rosehill, the two tracks joined, before dividing into two bi-directional tracks, the Sandown line and the Carlingford line. Rosehill station had two platforms; one four-car long platform on the Carlingford line and one platform which was approximately sixteen-cars long on the Sandown line track which was used for special events at Rosehill Gardens Racecourse. Originally these operated as conventional platforms; the shorter platform being served by northbound services and the longer one by southbound services with the double track merging into a single track to the north of the station. However on race days, the shorter platform would be served by services in both directions to allow for the section immediately north of the station on the southbound track to stable race day trains. In June 1992 the junction was moved to south of Rosehill station with the shorter platform served by Calingford line services in both directions and the longer platform only by race day trains and Sandown line services.Signalling & Safeworking Railway Digest August 1992 page 312Camellia Railway Digest September 1992 pages 338-341 The line then headed in a north- easterly direction over the Parramatta River to Carlingford. The stations from Camellia to Carlingford consisted of a single platform of a sufficient length to accommodate four-carriage trains. There were no crossing loops or any further sections of double track on the line, and thus no capacity for trains to pass each other. There were no signals past Rosehill, meaning the entire section of line is one block, meaning only one train could be in this section at any time. Trains entering or exiting this block were detected using an axle counter. The section between Rosehill and Clyde was controlled using conventional track circuits and signals.

Originally the line was privately owned by two companies: the line from Clyde to Rosehill was owned by John Bennett and the line from Rosehill to Carlingford was owned by the Rosehill Railway Company. The lines were taken over by their bank in 1896, with the Government purchasing the line in 1898 and recommencing services on 1 August 1900. The line was duplicated to just south of Camellia station on 19 June 1902.Railways and Tramways of the Parramatta Hills District Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin issue 210 April 1955 pages 50-54, 57-62The Carlingford-Clyde Branch Line Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin issue 446 December 1974 pages 266-283 The line from Clyde to Rosehill was electrified on 12 December 1936.

In 1996, the original iron lattice bridge over the Parramatta River was replaced. The new bridge only has one track, although it was built to allow a second track to be laid in the future. It sits on the refurbished piers of the original bridge.The Carlingford line's Camelia bridge project Railway Digest August 1996 pages 12/13 In early 2007 the pedestrian crossings at Telopea and Dundas stations were rebuilt. The new automatic crossings provide audible and visual warnings of an approaching train and a short time later close the metal gates. Over the week of 20 to 26 October 2007, the section of track from Telopea to Carlingford was completely replaced, utilising concrete sleepers instead of timber ones.Carlingford line track upgrade CityRail The section from Telopea to Rosehill was similarly upgraded over the fortnight of 22 June to 3 July 2009.Carlingford Line track upgrade CityRail The railway remains on timber sleepers from Rosehill to Clyde. The line was colour-coded orange in CityRail promotional material until 1991 when it was coded yellow (along with the Western Line). From 2000 it has been colour-coded dark blue.Network Map CityRail Until June 2010, the line carried oil trains to and from the Clyde Refinery on the Sandown line.Sandown: End of the Line Railway Digest September 2010 page 24 In October 2016, Sandown line traffic was officially suspended. A Stop Block was placed on the Sydney side of Access Road level crossing. Modification proposals The line's low frequency and low level of patronage led to various inquiries and studies into its future. A major problem was the level crossing over Parramatta Road, which held up traffic when trains travelled across it. Proposals included tunnel links to Clyde or Granville stations, or replacing the line altogether with a more frequent light rail or busway service.Transport group reveals rail plans for 'Bay Light Express' Sydney Morning Herald 27 January 2010 The New South Wales Government originally planned for the Carlingford line to be part of Stage 2 of the Parramatta Rail Link. That plan would have incorporated the majority of the line, with the section between Carlingford and Camellia duplicated. Telopea, Dundas, and Rydalmere stations would also have been duplicated and upgraded to allow eight car trains. Camellia station would have been demolished, and Rosehill station closed and replaced by a new underground station with a preliminary name of 'Rosehill/Camellia'. Carlingford station would also have been replaced by an underground station. Various proposals were put forward, including a three-way underground junction near Carlingford, linking the station to the proposed North West Rail Link, as well as the line to Chatswood. In 2003, the Minister for Transport, Michael Costa announced that only Stage 1 of the line, from Chatswood to Epping, would be built, but the Carlingford line section was indefinitely postponed. Under the Rail Clearways Project, announced in 2004, the line was to have had a crossing loop at Rydalmere, thus allowing an increase in train frequency to half-hourly throughout the day. However, that part of the Clearways Project was cancelled in November 2008.\\"Rail Clearways for Sydney\\". Transit Australia. September 2004. p.284NSW Minibudget NSW Government November 2008 In August 2010, the Federal Government promised $2.6 billion towards the project, which, along with funding from the New South Wales Government, would have allowed the line to be extended from Epping to Parramatta via the Carlingford line. Work was to commence in 2011, with a projected 2017 finish. Following a change of government at the 2011 state election, the project was shelved. A large amount of land lies behind Carlingford station, for future extensions of the line. Parramatta Light Rail In 2013, Parramatta City Council published a feasibility study into a Western Sydney Light Rail network. The study proposed the construction of a light rail line from Parramatta to the Macquarie Centre, running parallel to the Carlingford line between Camelia and Dundas. The report noted that while the future of the railway line was a matter for the state government, conversion of the line to light rail would reduce the cost of the light rail's construction significantly.Western Sydney Light Rail Network Parramatta City Council In December 2015, the NSW government announced the Camellia to Carlingford section of the line would be converted to light rail, forming a branch of the Parramatta Light Rail network. That would replace the connection to the Sydney Trains network at Clyde with a link to Parramatta and Westmead. As a consequence, the Carlingford line north of Parramatta Road was closed on 5 January 2020 to allow conversion works to take place. Much of the remaining section closed permanently. That included Rosehill station, which is not on the light rail route. The short section between Clyde and the Parramatta Road level crossing will remain open to allow access to Sydney Trains' track inspection depot. The Sandown line was formally closed in July 2019.

He was the son of Rev. Zebulon Ely, and was born in Lebanon, Connecticut in 1786.Curtis Dahl, \\"The Clergyman, the Hussy, and Old Hickory: Ezra Stiles Ely and the Peggy Eaton Affair,\\" Journal of Presbyterian History 52, no. 2 (Summer 1974): 137-155. In 1803, he graduated from Yale at the age of seventeen and was licensed to preach a year later. In October 1806, he was settled as pastor of the church in Colchester, Connecticut (Westchester parish). In 1810, he left to begin his duties as the Stated Preacher of the New York Almshouse under the sponsorship of the Presbytery of New York, one of the largest churches in the city at the time. He served the Almshouse in the years 1811 and 1813, and wrote two journals documenting his experience. In 1814 he was called to the pastorate of the Pine Street Church in Philadelphia, where he continued over twenty years. As a friend and confidant of Andrew Jackson, Ely advocated for a \\"Christian Party\\" during the 1820s.Dahl, \\"The Clergyman, the Hussy, and Old Hickory\\", 141 Around 1834, he began establishing a College and Theological Seminary in Marion County, Missouri, known as Marion College. The financial reverses of 1837 frustrated the undertaking and created trouble for Ely, and he was arrested twice for land deals gone awry, and Curtis Dahl documented Ely's advising role with a political sex scandal (the notorious Peggy Eaton Affair/Petticoat Affair).Curtis Dahl, \\"The Clergyman, the Hussy, and Old Hickory: Ezra Stiles Ely and the Peggy Eaton Affair,\\" Journal of Presbyterian History 52, no. 2 (Summer 1974): 137-155. In 1844, he entered on pastoral duties in the First Presbyterian Church in New London Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania, and continued his labors until 1851, when he had a stroke, and was paralyzed. He was a quick thinker, a gifted speaker, and an imaginative writer. For several years, he edited a religious paper named, The Philadelphian. He was the author of The Journal of the Stated Preacher to the Hospital and Almshouse, in the City of New-York, for the Year of Our Lord 1811, otherwise known as Visits of Mercy, and, of Conversations on the Science of the Human Mind (Phil. 1819). In 1828, he assisted in publishing a Collateral Bible, or Key to the Holy Scriptures, and he edited his father's memoir. He received a Doctor of Divinity degree from Washington College in Tennessee. He was twice married and two of his children survived him. He died in Philadelphia, Pa., June 17, 1861, aged 75.  Ely & the Poor Ely serves as an example of how early nineteenth century American Christian ministers viewed the problem of urban poverty. Ely, through his work in the New York Almshouse (1811, 1813), was credited as being \\"one of the first in America to face openly the problem of prostitution and to deal sympathetically with its victims.\\" Ibid., 142 His sympathy for the poor he served, however, was reflected in lines such as: asking if it would be lawful \\"to confine in work- houses some of the clamorous and diseased persons, who are a nuisance to the city?\\"Ely, Ezra Stiles. The Journal of the Stated Preacher to the Hospital and Almshouse, in the City of New-York, for the Year of Our Lord 1811. New York: Whiting and Watson, 1812. 75 He also called for the banning of the procreation of the poor by separating families in the Almshouse: \\"No sort of connexion [sic] should exist between men, women, and children. This would prevent the multiplication of many paupers.\\" Ibid. Ely‚Äôs anti-procreation solution did not abate in time. Two years later he wrote how poor children were \\"born and educated in the Almshouse for the devil\\" and that \\"the evil will extend, and the miserable will procreate children of misery\\" unless the genders were separated.\\".Ely, Ezra Stiles. The Second Journal of the Stated Preacher to the Hospital and Almshouse, in the City of New-York, for a Part of the Year of Our Lord 1813. Philadelphia: M. Carey, 1815, 40. Ely's ideology regarding the poor was rooted in the concept of Divine Benevolence.Michael B. Katz, The Undeserving Poor: America's Enduring Confrontation with Poverty, New York: Oxford University Press, 2013, 2-3.; Raymond A. Mohl, \\"Poverty, Pauperism, and Social Order in the Preindustrial American City, 1780-1840,\\" Social Science Quarterly, 52, no. 4 (March 1972): 934-948. This belief entailed that the problem of poverty was a fact of nature. Poverty, in this view, has always been a problem and always will be.John Stanford, Divine Benevolence to the Poor: A Discourse Delivered Before the Honourable the Mayor and Corporation of the City of New-York, April 29, 1816, on Opening the Chapel in the New Alms- House, Bellevue, New York: T. and J. Swords, 1816, 8-20. The poverty-stricken were believed to be in their state, not due to external forces such as economics, war, or famine, but because they have made poor life choices, or are too insufficient as humans to be prosperous. This is an important concept to consider as events such as the War of 1812, trade embargoes, and numerous market fluctuations during the era had severe, and negative consequences, on the problem of poverty. Divine Benevolence held that Christians that were better off serving the poor with compassion and direction towards more godly living and away from the dangers of vice. Direct assistance, in the form of food, clothing, or fuel for fire, was viewed as an enabling agent, and was therefore discouraged. Although Ely described his written work about the poor as: ‚ÄúMy journal is of necessity the record of wretchedness,‚ÄùStiles.

Digital micro display technology provides dynamic stereolithography masks that work as a virtual photomask. This technique allows for rapid photopolymerization of an entire layer with a flash of UV illumination at micro-scale resolution. The mask can control individual pixel light intensity, allowing control of material properties of the fabricated structure with desired spatial distribution. Materials include polymers, responsive hydrogels, shape memory polymers and bio-materials.  Introduction  The micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) is developing quickly in the past 30 years. Relying on the integration of sensors and actuators, MEMS always demand cheaper, easier and more precise method to fabricate micro size 3-D structures using different materials such as polymers, ceramics and semiconductor materials. The appearance of the Projection Micro- stereolithography improves the development of MEMS by achieving most of the requirements above. This invention is based on the stereolithography (3D printing), which developed by Charles Hull in 1984. This machine is primarily used to fabricate soft materials such as hydro gels and polymers. The basic theory behind this invention is using UV light to cure the solution, which consists initiators, monomers and absorbers, to form each layer of materials. Under the exposure of UV light, the initiators are transferred into the radicals. Radicals connect monomers together to begin the polymerization process. The absorbers are mixed with monomers to control the depth of UV light penetration. This chemical process allows the areas under UV exposure to become solid state polymers.  History  At first, all micro size stereolithography method utilized the same method as the macro size stereolithography that they direct write materials on the base. The first micro size stereolithography that use the UV light to cure the liquid resin surface is developed by professor Ikuta and Hirowatari in 1993. This fabrication approach is the prototype of today's projection micro-stereolithography. Compared with previous direct writing fabrication methods, this approach has the advantage that it can fabricate each layer simultaneously which increases the yield rate for large production. At that time, 2D shape data was obtained in a CAD system. The 2D data is used to fabricate 2D sliced planes in the liquid. Therefore, several 2D planes have to be made in the CAD system for complicated structures. This stereolithography can be used to fabricate both polymers and metals. Metals are fabricated using the casting process after a polymer mold is made. Although improves the yield rate, this method requires a mask for each layer of the final product, which increases process time and cost. Therefore, the fabricate technology is developed again that the masks are replaced by the micromirror display device, which is similar to the projector in our daily life. The micromirror display provides a dynamic mask that can change the patterns electronically. Since multiple masks are displaced by one mask, the processing time and fabrication cost are greatly decrease.  Process  The dynamic mask defines the beam. The beam is focused on the surface of a UV- curable polymer resin through a projection lens that reduces the image to the desired size. Once a layer is polymerized, the stage drops the substrate by a predefined layer thickness, and the dynamic mask displays the image for the next layer on top of the preceding one. This proceeds iteratively until complete. The process can create layer thickness on the order of 400 nm. Sub 2 ¬µm horizontal and sub-1 ¬µm vertical resolutions have been achieved, with sub-1 ¬µm feature sizes. Process can work at ambient temperature and atmosphere, although increased nitrogen improves polymerization Production rates of 4 cu mm/hr have been achieved, depending on resin viscosity. Materials can be easily switched during fabrication, enabling integration of multiple material elements in a single process.  Applications  Applications include fabricating microactuators, creating molds, electroplating or (with resin additives) ceramic items, including micro-bio reactors to support tissue growth, micromatrices for drug delivery and detection and biochemical integrated circuits to simulate biological systems.  Microactuator  Inspired by Mimosa pudica, the leaf of this actuator can swell upon the external stimulations such as solvents, temperature and light. In order to control the motion of this actuator, microfluidic channels are embedded inside the leaf of this actuator. With both complex external geometries and internal structures, this soft microactuator can be fabricated using Projection Micro-stereolithography, which is one of the easiest ways to obtain this complex 3D structures. The CAD mold of this actuator is generated in a computer. The sliced 2D images are obtained next. Each 2D image is then projected by the micromirror display and go through the lens to a desired size to the surface of the polymer resin. Since Projection Micro-stereolithography is time-saving, the same experiment can be done on different liquid soft materials in order to learn the swelling effect of them. Based on this contraction and extension of materials caused by a small drop of solvent or a small change in environmental conditions, this microactuator can mimic the motion of the human muscle and can be used on many soft robotic applications.  Artificial Tissue  Many reconstructive surgery procedures require new tissues when the original tissues are removed because of illnesses. One way to generate this new tissue is to take one part of tissue from another part of the human body and transfer it to the new site. However, this method causes damage to other organs while generating new tissues. Therefore, fabricating artificial tissues is a preferred approach to solve this problem. The major limitation of this artificial tissue is the absence of the capillary system to transport nutrient and oxygen like the circulatory systems in living organisms. With the ability to fabricate complex 3D structures, the Projection Micro-stereolithography may provide one of the best solutions to this tissue. Like the microactuator, the mold of the artificial tissue is made by CAD. Then the CAD mold is transferred to 2D images and projected to the surface of the polymer resin through a lens. The capillary system is embedded in the tissue during the mold designing process in the CAD mold. The polymer used in fabricating the tissue is semi-permeable, which allows the nutrient and oxygen in the capillary system go into the tissue during the transportation process. The capillary system is shown to have growth promoting function in yeast cells, which illustrate the viability of this artificial tissue.

Founded in 2005. Feit is owned and operated by brothers Tull and Josh Price. FEIT products are handmade using natural materials. History Tull Price grew up between Australia and Israel. He became interested in sneakers at an early age and founded Royal Elastics, as well as the footwear division of rag & bone. His brother Josh Price was a DJ in Australia at the time and became involved in Royal Elastics by hosting parties in both NYC and Sydney. The brand opened their first store in Sydney in 2006. They opened their second store in the Nolita area of NYC in November 2014. Their second New York City store opened September 2015 in the West Village. The brand is now based in NYC. Store Design FEIT's first New York City location is across the street from The New Museum and was designed by installation artist Jordana Maisie Goot. The 500-square foot store is built largely from matte-polyurethaned birch plywood, and has been featured in the design magazine Frame. FEIT's second NYC location in the city's West Village opened in September 2015. The store was also built by installation artist Jordana Maisie Goot. According to an article published by The New York Times, the 420-square-foot space features \\"Large slabs of raw wood float inches apart, from floor to ceiling ‚Äî with nooks carved out to display the products\\" and features \\"an intricate lighting system with white LED lights that allows the store to brighten and dim depending on the time of day and season\\". Dezeen Architecture and Design Magazine, in an interview with Jordana describes the construction process as \\"similar to the process of shaping leather, the design team used moulds to carve out display shelves from blocks of timber during the 3D-modelling stage. The shelving components, made of Baltic birch plywood, were cut using a computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine. They were formed into modules and then delivered to the store.\\" Sustainable Construction All FEIT shoes are handmade using biodegradable materials in factories with a low environmental impact that are free of harmful chemicals and synthetic materials. They are hand stitched without the use of machines to help reduce the amount of waste produced by the factory. \\"The sole is made up of five individual pieces. An internal leather midsole, a layer of natural cork, a buffalo leather outsole, a rubber tread and a vegetable leather strip which encases the sole to the upper.\\" The shoe also includes a natural bamboo shank, buffalo leather insoles, natural leather welt, and cotton cording to sew it all together. FEIT shoes are primarily made using two different shoe- making techniques: Hand Sewn Goodyear and Hand Sewn Stitchdown construction.  Biotrainer First released in 2014, the \\"Bio-Trainer\\" is the world's first all-natural, biological handmade sneaker. Produced from vegetable-dyed suede and leather, the sneaker features a 100% natural latex rubber sole made from the milk of the Hevea brasiliensis tree.

There have been a variety of architects and movements whose work has been characterised in this way, especially Modernism. Other examples include Constructivism, Neoplasticism (De Stijl), Neo-futurism, Deconstructivism, Parametricism and Expressionism.  Concept  Avant-garde architecture has been described as progressive in terms of aesthetics. However, it is noted for covering a broad range of aesthetic and political spectrum. It is associated with the liberal left but also cited as apolitical, right-wing, and conservative in its politics and aesthetics. It is also considered a stream within modernism that is anti-elitist and open to the contamination of mass culture. The concept draws from the idea of integration of life and art. In the De Stijl Manifesto V, it was stated that art and life are not separate domains, hence, the argument that art is not an illusion or disconnected from reality. This view pushed for the construction of an environment that is according to the creative laws derived from a fixed principle. A conceptualization by Le Corbusier described avant-garde architecture as constructed for the pleasure of the eye and comes with \\"inner cleanness, for the course adopted leads to a refusal to allow anything at all which is not correct, authorised, intended, desired, thought-out.\\"  Criticism  Critics note that avant-garde architecture contradicts the very definition of architecture because its position is contrary to its most specific characteristics. Its importance is said to be exaggerated since it is always marginal to any decisive change. It is also noted that many avat-garde architectural projects do not fare well once evaluated according to suitability principles. According to Eileen Gray, it is obsessed with the external at the expense of the interior.

Pictures Group, dedicated to the production of films based on characters from DC Entertainment. Walter Hamada is the current president of DC Films. History After the critical failure of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Warner Bros. Pictures made moves to correct the direction of the DC Extended Universe. The studio reorganized in May 2016 to have genre-responsible film executives, thus DC Entertainment franchise films under Warner Bros. were placed under a newly created division, DC Films, created under Warner Bros. executive vice president Jon Berg and DC Comics chief content officer Geoff Johns. This was done in hopes of competing more directly with Marvel Studios' Marvel Cinematic Universe. Johns also kept his existing role at DC Comics. However, the division's formation was not designed to override the \\"director-driven\\" mandate. Justice League had one of the biggest film budgets (nearly $300 million) but grossed about $96 million in its opening weekend. A Washington Post analysis expected that there would be a course correction again, with a possible change in leadership. The DC Extended Universe operated under a \\"director-driven\\" mandate. Forbes contributors felt that the course correction would be for DC Films to give up on the shared universe, while continuing with the Wonder Woman films and occasionally other films, as Warner Bros. has other franchises they can work with. Despite this, in December the studio reiterated their current film slate for the unofficially titled DC Extended Universe. That same month, Warner Bros. announced that a new strategy and organization of DC Films would occur with Berg leaving his position as studio's co-president of production to form a Warner Bros.-based production company with Roy Lee, the producer of The LEGO Movie and It. In January 2018, it was announced that Warner Bros. executive Walter Hamada will be the new president of DC Films, and will oversee the films in the DC Extended Universe. Hamada has been closely associated with New Line Cinema, and helped develop horror films, such as It and The Conjuring film franchises. Criticism over \\"director-driven\\" mandate DC Films' \\"director-driven\\" mandate has been met with skepticism. Suicide Squad actress Margot Robbie, who played Harley Quinn and the producer of several upcoming Harley Quinn-related movies stated that (DC) producers must trust their director's vision. ‚ÄúIn the DC Universe, too, once you decide on who your director is, and they have a vision, you have to enable that vision and step in at moments to keep it on course if need be. I think that‚Äôs the way. I think that‚Äôs what a producer should do,\\" Robbie said. Zack Snyder dealt with studio pressure to make Justice League funnier and lighter in the wake of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice‚Äôs negative reviews because of its dark tone. Eventually, he stepped down, and Joss Whedon was hired to do re-shoots for the movie. Whedon originally wanted a funnier opening sequence involving Batman. However, instead of adhering to Whedon's vision the studio tweaked the scene to make it serious. Later, Whedon was tasked to make the movie under two hours long. Director Rick Famuyiwa, who was originally involved with the upcoming Flash movie, disparaged Justice League over the success of Black Panther, which surpassed the total U.S. gross of Justice League in just four days and became one of the highest-grossing films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He parted ways with Warner Bros. due to creative differences. In November 2017, it was reported that the studio wanted to recast Kiersey Clemons who was Famuyiwa's pick to play Iris West. Her scene was cut from Justice League. It was also hinted that it was the studio's decision to move away from Famuyiwa's take on the Flash.

It was established in 1985, and has grown to 28 departments across eight colleges. Markey has four clinic facilities located in three buildings, with dedicated research spaces in the Dorothy Enslow Combs Cancer Research Facility and Healthy Kentucky Research Building.  History  The McDowell Cancer Network was created in 1975 as an outreach/education program. The overarching mission of Markey is to reduce cancer mortality in Kentucky through a comprehensive program of cancer research, treatment, education and community engagement. On July 12, 2013 Markey Cancer Center was designated as a National Cancer Institute facility. Markey is the only NCI-designated cancer center in Kentucky and the 68th in the United States. Markey is estimated to receive $17.6 million from the NCI annually, with $10.8 million in direct costs. Members are aligned with one of four research programs: Cancer Cell Biology and Signaling; Cancer Prevention and Control; Drug Discovery, Delivery and Translational Therapeutics; and Genomic Instability, Epigenetics and Metabolism. Five shared research facilities (SRFs) provide services to support research: Biostatistics and Bioinformatics; Biospecimen Procurement and Translational Pathology; Cancer Research Informatics; Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting; and Redox Metabolism. Two developing SRFs are aligned with the center‚Äôs recent scientific expansions: Behavioral and Community-Based Research and Oncogenomics.  Facilities  The Markey Cancer Center is located on the University of Kentucky's campus. It is found on the north central side of the UK Albert B. Chandler Hospital facility. The UK Markey Cancer Center includes four buildings grouped around a central courtyard, as well as a new patient floor in the UK Albert B. Chandler Hospital. These facilities are the Ben F. Roach Cancer Care Facility, the Dorothy Enslow Combs Cancer Research Facility, the M. Margrite Davis and Ralph E. Mills Magnetic Imaging and Spectroscopy Center, and the Marylou Whitney and John Hendrickson Cancer Facility for Women. These four facilities comprise the Markey Cancer Center, all working together on the prevention, treatment and cure for cancer. The Ben F Roach Cancer Care Facility  Ben F. Roach Cancer Care Facility  The Ben F. Roach Cancer Care Facility (Pavilion CC) of the Markey Cancer Center provides over 52,000 square feet of space dedicated to the individualized care of cancer patients across the four story facility. Outpatient clinical space on the ground floor supports the Hematology Program, Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Program and the Radiation Medicine outpatient clinic; modern radiation therapy equipment is located in the basement. The second and third floors house inpatient rooms with satellite bases for all primary services and outpatient cancer services for Radiation Oncology, Hematologic/BMT disease, and Head, Neck and Respiratory disease. A linear accelerator and brachytherapy unit are located in the basement of the Ben F. Roach Building of the cancer center and a GAMMA Knife irradiation facility is located in the underground corridor connector between the Roach Building and the UK Hospital. The fourth floor houses office space for clinical and research faculty, and the MCC Research Communications Office (RCO), which provides critical infrastructure for grant/manuscript preparation, editing, and graphics assistance.  M. Margrite Davis and Ralph E. Mills Magnetic Imaging and Spectroscopy Center  The Margrite Davis and Ralph Mills Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy Center houses instrumentation, research laboratories and support services for molecular, cellular, animal and human spectroscopic imaging, aiding the study of disease processes and evaluation of responses to treatment. The office tower of the MRISC Building is integrated with the Whitney-Hendrickson building. Dorothy Enslow Combs Cancer Research Building  Dorothy Enslow Combs Cancer Research Facility  The Combs Building provides over 24,500 square feet of laboratory, office and conference spaces. It houses primary research laboratories dedicated to cancer research, including core facilities for high field NMR, DNA sequencing, protein sequencing, peptide synthesis and oligonucleotide synthesis. In addition to its research facilities, the Combs Building is also home to Markey's support services from clinical social workers, registered dietitians, integrative medicine clinicians and more.  Marylou Whitney and John Hendrickson Cancer facility for Women  The Whitney-Hendrickson Facility housing Davis Center functions as the MCC‚Äôs primary ambulatory care facility. The three-story facility houses outpatient space for evaluation and treatment of solid tumor neoplasms including: lung, head and neck, sarcoma, GI, and urologic cancers (1st floor); breast cancer (2nd floor); and gynecologic cancers (3rd floor).  Awards and Reception  On July 12, 2013 Markey Cancer Center was designated as a National Cancer Institute facility. Markey is estimated to receive $1.5 million from the NCI annually. Kentucky has increased from 49th to 23rd in screening rates within a decade. Markey patients' have a five-year survival rate in ovarian, lung, brain, prostate, and Stage IV colorectal cancer higher than patients from other centers in Kentucky. Nationally, Markey's five-year survival rates are higher in brain, liver, and prostate cancers than other patients.

It is distinct from other editors which focus on automated computation such as integration or equation solving (Mathematica, Maple etc.) or on the presentation quality of the resulting document (e.g. LaTeX). The focus of Ket is to enable the user to perform algebra quickly and efficiently. It is therefore closer to a text editor, whiteboard or to the back of an envelope. However, it does provide a range of tools to automate the individual steps of algebra.  Overview  Ket breaks equation editing into a series of small edits performed by keyboard or mouse gestures. This is because equations contain a wide assortment of symbols and notations, but also contain a great deal of repetition. As a result, it is faster to reuse existing expressions than it is to re-write them. This becomes even more pronounced when performing algebra which consists of modifying and combining existing expressions adding further repetition. Commands are built around abstract transformations of the structure of the equation. Some commands delete, reorganize and combine existing expressions and some add new content. Commands are all responsive enough to provide instantaneous updates. The user can therefore view an equation in conventional mathematical notation while interacting with a series of small fragments.  Representations  300px Ket maintains three distinct representations of an equation. Equations are displayed to the user and may be exported in images in conventional mathematical notation. Internally it is most efficient to represent the equation as a Tree structure which standardizes direction commands. But when writing equation fragments or saving them to file, a custom markdown language is used which merges markdown, LaTeX and plain text mathematical notations as applicable. Conventional mathematical notation is represented by a series of boxes within boxes each containing letters and lines to denote what function, operation, variable or value they represent. After each edit, equations are converted to this form and rendered. However, edit commands represent the equation differently and keyboard direction commands reflect this. Analogous to a filesystem hierarchy of files and folders within folders, each equation is represented as a Tree structure. Each equation in Ket is a tree of operations and functions (tree branches) and variables and values (tree leaves). The file format consists of its own, non-standard markdown language. Also, when editing, any equation fragments are typed in plain text and converted to the tree. The equation is represented in memory and converted to a tree map in order to display it to the user. The file format is plain text which is converted to and from a tree when files are loaded and saved.  Interaction  300px Various forms of interaction are possible. These include reorganizing the tree structure and performing simple algebraic operations. Mouse drags allow the user to change the order of arguments to a function. They can also add and remove fragments of an expression into another equation including substituting for a variable. While a plain text representation of pages of equations can quickly become unwieldy, working with small fragments of plain text are a quick way to replace, identify or update an existing selection. If good writing is rewriting then good algebra is reorganizing existing expressions.  Editing  The quickest form of editing is by mouse gestures to substitute one equation into another. Additionally, either through the right click menu or right-dragging in the menu items direction, arguments may be deleted, copied or added. Ket is a modal editor which means that it changes how it displays information and how the user interacts with it depending on the mode it's in. By default, keyboard commands perform specific selection or transformation commands such as to delete the current selection, 'x'. Some commands must be followed with a direction, for example paste, 'p'. Other commands require a block of text such as to replace the selection with an equation fragment, 'r'. Editing lines of text The editor displays a list of lines of either text, equations, images or plots. In order to edit text, starts editing text while or stops. Here takes a new line and continues editing text. All editing takes place relative to the current selection so a variety of commands to change the selection are provided. In order to move around, it is possible to use arrow keys, however it is quicker to keep your hands in the touch typing position so various keys signify directions. In addition to moving up, 'k', and down, 'j', between equations, it is possible to move in and out of each equation. That is, to select different parts of the tree. 'h' and 'l' select the previous and next expression while 'i' and 'o' select the left and right arguments of the tree. Lastly, moves back out. After pressing a command that requires an equation fragment, the program changes mode. Here a plain text representation of an equation fragment may be typed. This mode also allows Readline commands familiar to Bash and Emacs users. This is then converted to an equation fragment by pressing (or cancelled with ). Transformation commands Editing can take place at different levels of meaning. Editing need not preserve the original meaning of an expression. So for example, a polynomial pattern could be reused by copying it and replacing all of the variables with new ones. Various syntactic and semantic transformations are also possible. Some are trivial such as replacing the current selection, 'r', with a new fragment. Others may be cycled through such as the Distributive property :a (b+c) = a b+a c using and . Commands such as replace require fragments of an equation to be represented in plain text. Often a text fragment has already been typed and may be referred to. If the fragment exists in the current equation then use \\"\\\\address\\" (a backslash followed by an address without quotes). Here successive digits of an address refer to the nth argument. Similarly, existing equations may be referred to as \\"#1\\" for equation 1 etc. And an address within another equation referred to as \\"1#234\\" for the 2nd argument's 3rd argument's 4th argument within equation 1.

Kirkaldy tied for third place in the 1882 Open Championship and placed eighth and T9 in the 1879 and 1884 Open Championships, respectively. His younger brothers Andrew and Hugh were also professional golfers.  Early life  Born in St Andrews in 1858, Kirkaldy took naturally to golf as a boy. As a young professional he was posted at Alexandra Park in Glasgow for a time. He also worked in Cannes, France, where he was a noted instructor of golf. He favorite club was the cleek, and he sometimes played with only that club against competitors with a full complement of clubs.  1882 Open Championship   Details of play  The 1882 Open Championship was the 22nd Open Championship, held 30 September at the Old Course at St Andrews, Fife, Scotland. Bob Ferguson won the Championship for the third successive time, by three strokes from Willie Fernie. Kirkaldy had rounds of 86-89=175 and won ¬£6 in prize money. Ferguson led after the morning round with an 83. Going out in 40 he started back 4-3-4 and with some steady play came back in 43, despite a six at the 16th. Fitz Boothby, a local amateur, scored 86 despite a couple of sevens in the closing holes. He shared second place with Jack Kirkaldy with Jamie Anderson and Tom Kidd on 87. Boothby scored 89 in the second round and took an early lead on 175. Anderson and Bob Martin, playing together, each had good rounds and they also both finished on 175. Ferguson again played steadily, going out in 42. Starting home he continued to score well and, despite a few sixes on his card, he avoided major disasters and finished with an 88 and a total of 171. The best of the later starters was Fernie. Despite starting with a six he was out in 40 and finished in 86 for a total of 174, good enough for second place. Ferguson's win was his third in succession, once on each of the Championship courses, matching the achievement of Anderson from 1877 to 1879. His ¬£12 first prize was a record for the Open at that time.  Death  Kirkaldy died on 10 November 1907 in St Andrews, Scotland.

Multigun, Multi Gun or Multi-Gun, often also called 2-Gun or 3-Gun depending on the types of firearms used, are practical shooting events where each of the stages require the competitor to use a combination of handguns, rifles, and/or shotgunsThe Exciting Sport of 3-Gun Shooting  National Shooting Sports Foundation Multigun has a lot in common with ordinary IPSC/ USPSA single gun matches, and matches generally have courses of fire where the shooter must move through different stages and engage targets in a variety of different positions. Multigun in its oldest form is arranged by the International Practical Shooting Confederation (IPSC) as Tournaments, but doesn't require the competitor to transition between firearms during the stage. Instead tournaments consists of separate Component Matches for each firearm type with a combined scoring in the end.  Multigun associations   In the U.S.  A competitor during a rifle stage at the 2018 USPSA Multigun Championship. 3-Gun competitions with handguns, rifles and shotguns have been organized in the U.S. since at least the Soldier of Fortune matches starting from 1979 in Missouri.The 3 Gun, Multi-Gun Report - James R. Morris SFC RET, page 1 \\"Kurt Miller [..] about the origin of 3-Gun: As far as I know the first of its kind was the S.O.F. World Championship 3-Gun Tactical Match. It started in 1979 and the first couple of matches were held at Freedom Missouri.\\"] Multigun competitions today take place from the small level in most local areas up to large annual national competitions. The two large multigun sanctioning bodies in the U.S. are: * United States Practical Shooting Association (USPSA)2018 USPSA Rifle Shotgun Multigun Rules * 3-Gun Nation (3GN)3-Gun Nation Multi-Gun Rules Apr 2017 V1.2 The USPSA Multigun Championship has been held yearly since 1990.PASA History  PASA Park \\"PASA has for 29 years also been home to a wide variety of national and international championship shooting sports events, including [... the] inaugural USPSA National 3-Gun Championship (1990)\\" NBC Sports series 3-Gun Nation (3GN) has begun a professional series featuring the top 64 ranked shooters in the country competing in a points series culminating in a year-end shoot-off for $50,000. 3-Gun Nation today also has affiliate clubs in over ten countries. Additionally, there are many \\"outlaw\\" matches, meaning there are no associated sanctioning body. \\"Outlaw\\" matches mainly use competition rules from either: * International Multi-Gun Association (IMA),IMA-Multigun Rules RB Rev32 2018-01-28 a ruleset offered by SMM3G, or * United Multigun League (UML),United Multi-Gun League Rules, Version 1.5, March 2018 a ruleset offered by the United Shooting Sports Leagues. Some of the largest annual events include the Brownells Rockcastle Pro Am 3 Gun Championship, the USPSA Multigun Championship, the Rocky Mountain 3-Gun, the DPMS Tri-Gun Challenge, the Superstition Mountain Mystery 3-Gun (SMM3G) and the Larue Tactical Multigun Championship. The International Defensive Pistol Association (IDPA) formerly also offered a 3-Gun ruleset.  Equipment  A Limited division competitor firing his handgun.  Power factor and calibers  In regular matches competitors can compete with any centerfire caliber they wish, as long as the power factor requirements are satisfied. Multigun in general has fewer division specific power factor requirements than USPSA/IPSC single gun matches. This means that anyone can be competitive with readily available factory ammunition in affordable calibers, and in practice almost all multigun competitors use handguns and Pistol Caliber Carbines (PCC) in 9x19 mm minor handgun, .223 Rem minor rifle, and 12 gauge major shotgun. This way competitors don't have to worry about exotic calibers or handloading to achieve a perceived scoring advantage due to a power factor scoring handicap. All multigun associations also offer a separate Heavy division requiring larger calibers, like for instance a .45 ACP major handgun, .308 Win major rifle, and 12 12 gauge major shotgun. Some associations also have separate matches for .22 LR rimfire handguns and rifles.  Divisions  Divisions have become very specialized, but all rulesets offer roughly similar divisions with small variations under different names. * IPSC: Open, Modified, Standard, Production. * USPSA: Open, Tactical, Limited, Heavy Metal Tactical and Heavy Metal Limited. * 3GN: Unlimited, Practical, Practical 308, Factory and Heavy. * IMA: Open, Stealth, Tactical, Limited and Heavy Metal. * UML: Open, Limited, Tactical Optics, Heavy Optics. Also with the variations 2x4 Open, 2x4 Tactical, PCC Only, 2 Gun (Handgun and Rifle). ;Open / Unlimited / Stealth : Open was the largest division in multigun for many years, but was quickly surpassed by Tac Ops from its introduction and is the smallest division today. All firearms may have compensators, ports and/or any number of optical sights. Any number of bipods and similar supporting devices may be used on the rifle and shotgun, and can be added or removed at any time. ;Modified / Practical / Tactical Optics: This division has by far the largest match participation with around 70-80 % of the competitors. Handguns and shotguns can only be iron sighted, while the rifle can be fitted with one optic with variable magnification as well as any number of iron sights. Compensators are not permitted, except for on the rifle where it must be within maximum dimensions of 1x3 in (25.4x76.2 mm), and bipods are not permitted. ;Factory / Limited / Standard: This division is restricted to iron sights on handguns and shotguns. Rifles are restricted to one non-magnified optical rifle sight, such as a 1x prism, holographic or red dot sight, and any number of iron sights. IPSC however limits Standard rifle to iron sights only. Compensators are not permitted, except for on the rifle where it must be within maximum dimensions of 1x3 in (25.4x76.2 mm), and bipods are not permitted. ;Heavy / Practical 308: All multigun associations offer a separate Heavy division requiring larger major calibers. The handgun must often be a .45 ACP major caliber with maximum ten rounds capacity, the rifle must often be a .308 Win major caliber with power factor of minimum 360 kgr¬∑ft/s (7.11 Ns), and the shotgun usually is required to be a manual 12 gauge pump. Rules vary some on rifle sights, with one scope of any variable magnification sometimes being permitted, only one non-magnified optic sometimes being permitted, or sometimes iron sights only.  Scoring  The score is based on both time and accuracy. The competitor's time is recorded electronically with a shot timer that detects the sound of the shots, giving the total time from the start signal until the last shot. Mainly two scoring methods are used, either Comstock or Time Plus. Most USPSA, 3GN and outlaw multigun matches use Time Plus scoring for faster scoring. This scoring method is faster, but has the drawback that if a competitor makes a time-consuming error on only one stage they may drop severely in the final match classification because the time scoring is cumulative. USPSA also has the possibility to use Comstock (Hit Factor) scoring, while IPSC uses Comstock only. With any of these methods the stage result is calculated based on both target scores and time used. * With Comstock, targets hits are scored and points subtracted for misses and any other penalties. The points are then divided by time to give the hit factor which determines the number of stage points. * With Time Plus, targets hits are ignored, but time added for misses and any other penalties. Minor and major power factor are usually scored equal in regards to target scoring zone values, contrary to what is common in USPSA/IPSC single gun matches.  Safety  The safety of all competitors, officials and spectators is always of the highest importance in competitions. Eye and ear protection is mandatory for both competitors and spectators. Multigun matches require some extra safety procedures compared to single gun matches due to the added element of transitioning between multiple firearms. When transitioning, both the used and new firearm must be in a safe condition, which means pointed in a safe direction with any applicable safety catch applied. Failure to comply will result in either a Stage or Match Disqualification (DQ) depending on the ruleset used.

It is a shrub with varying shades of pink or purple flowers, the stamens tipped with yellow anthers. In describing it, John Lindley noted: \\"every twig ... is terminated by hemispherical heads of brilliant pink\\". It is similar to Melaleuca manglesii and Melaleuca seriata. Description Melaleuca parviceps grows to about tall with its branchlets and leaves covered by small silky hairs. The leaves are arranged alternately, long and wide and linear or very narrow oval in shape. The flowers are arranged in heads or short spikes on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering, or sometimes in the upper leaf axils. The heads are up to in diameter and contain between 2 and 8 groups of flowers in threes. The petals are long and fall off soon after the flowers open. The stamens, which give the flower it colour are shades of pink, purple or mauve with yellow tips and are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle containing 6 to 10 stamens. Flowering is in spring and early summer and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules long. M. parviceps growing in Kalamunda National Park M. parviceps leaves, flowers and fruit Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca parviceps was first formally described in 1839 by John Lindley in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. The specific epithet (parviceps) is from the word Latin parvus, meaning \\"little\\" and the Latin suffix -ceps meaning \\"headed\\" \\"in reference to the small inflorescences in the type collection\\". Distribution and habitat Melaleuca parviceps occurs in the Darling Range near Perth and nearby inland areas in the Avon Wheatbelt, Jarrah Forest and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions. It grows in scrub, heath and forest in clay or sand over granite.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated that omaveloxolone possesses antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities and the ability to improve mitochondrial bioenergetics. Omaveloxolone is currently under clinical investigation for a variety of indications, including Friedreich‚Äôs ataxia, mitochondrial myopathies, immunooncology, and prevention of corneal endothelial cell loss following cataract surgery. Mechanism of action The effects of omaveloxolone and related synthetic triterpenoid compounds have been documented in over 200 peer-reviewed scientific manuscripts. The mechanism of action of omaveloxolone and its related compounds has been demonstrated to be through a combination of activation of the antioxidative transcription factor Nrf2 and inhibition of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-Œ∫B. Nrf2 transcriptionally regulates multiple genes that play both direct and indirect roles in producing antioxidative potential and the production of cellular energy (i.e., adenosine triphosphate or ATP) within the mitochondria. Consequently, unlike exogenously administered antioxidants (e.g., vitamin E or Coenzyme Q10), which provide a specific and finite antioxidative potential, omaveloxolone, through Nrf2, broadly activates intracellular and mitochondrial antioxidative pathways, in addition to pathways that may directly increase mitochondrial biogenesis (such as PGC1Œ±) and bioenergetics.  Research   Friedreich's Ataxia  There appears to be dose-dependent induction of Nrf2 target genes, along with induction of biomarkers of mitochondrial function in one early clinical trial. Time- and dose-dependent neurological improvements were observed. A phase 1 with patients was completed in 2017 and results from the phase 2 trail where showed in October 2019.

History Attempts were made to establish a municipal corporation at Kolkata from the middle of the 19th century. The electoral system was introduced for the first time in 1847, and 4 of the 7 board members were elected by the rate payers. In 1852 the board was replaced by a new one and in 1863 a new body was formed. As per old records, in 1872 there were 25 wards in Kolkata (spellings as in use at that time) ‚Äì 1. Shyampukur, 2.

A new municipal corporation was created in 1876, wherein 48 commissioners were elected and 24 were appointed by the government. With the implementation of the Municipal Consolidation Act of 1888 the area under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation was enlarged. Certain areas were already there but more parts of them were added (current spellings) - Entally, Manicktala, Beliaghata, Ultadanga, Chitpur, Cossipore, Beniapukur, Ballygunge, Watganj and Ekbalpur, and Garden Reach and Tollygunj.

Completed in 1915, it is a prominent local example of Beaux-Arts architecture, and is the third building to serve as city hall. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. Description and history Hartford's first city hall was a Greek Revival building, erected in 1827 and located at the corner of Market and Kingsley Streets. In 1897, the city offices were moved to the 1796 Old State House, which the state had made available after construction of the present Connecticut State Capitol. It was soon judged to be too small, and the present building was completed in 1915 after a design competition. Davis & Brooks, the winning architects, were local architects who had recently designed an addition to the high school. Land for the building was donated by J. Pierpont Morgan, who sought a suitable use for the parcel adjacent to a wing he had recently donated to the Wadsworth Atheneum. The Municipal Building is located south of Hartford's downtown central business district, and is bounded on the west, south and east by Main, Arch, and Prospect Streets. It is separated from the Wadsworth Atheneum by the Burr Memorial Mall, a former roadway converted into pedestrian plaza. The structure is built of brick faced with Bethel white granite, a copper and tile roof, and doors made of bronze. It has a three-story central atrium which is wide and long, decorated with panels depicting the history of the city of Hartford. The basement level has extensive Guastavino tile vaulting.

Paxton had three top-10 finishes in the Open Championship. He took second place in the 1880 Open Championship five shots behind winner Bob Ferguson. Paxton was an expert club and ball maker. His golf ball inventions included the Bramble and Sirdar models, the former being the ball of choice for Harry Vardon at one time. Paxton was also the designer of a number of golf courses, with Coventry Golf Club (Coventry, England) and East Berkshire Golf Club (East Berkshire, England) being among those designs. Early life Paxton was born in Musselburgh, Scotland, on 20 October 1857. Peter was born to James Paxton, a cab driver, and his wife Elizabeth Sharp. In September 1881 he married Sarah Hobley at Upton-upon- Severn, Worcestershire, England. They had two children, George and Elizabeth. His older brother George was also a professional golfer. Golf career 1880 Open Championship The 1880 Open Championship was held 9 April at Musselburgh Links, Musselburgh, East Lothian, Scotland. Bob Ferguson won the Championship by five strokes from runner-up Paxton who carded rounds of 81-86=167. 1883 Open Championship In the 1883 Open Championship, again held at Musselburgh Links, he was tied for tenth place. Bob Ferguson dominated play from 1880-82 by winning three Open Championships in a row. Paxton shots rounds of 46-39-39-43=167. 1885 Open Championship The 1885 Open Championship was the 25th Open Championship, held 3 October at the Old Course at St Andrews, Fife, Scotland. Bob Martin won the Championship for the second time, by one stroke from Archie Simpson. Paxton fired rounds of 85-91=176, finishing in eighth place, and won ¬£1 in prize money. Match vs. Albert Tingey, Sr. Paxton met Albert Tingey, Sr. in a memorable match on 27 October 1900 on a windy and wet day at Tooting Bec Golf Club in south London. Paxton, playing on his home links, was likely the betting favorite, although his results going in were not equal with Tingey who in October 1899 had halved against Harry Vardon at Watford and had been playing better golf in the short term. Heavy rain the day before had soaked the course making approach shots and putting difficult. Playing in stiff winds, the first 27 holes were stubbornly contested to a draw, but Tingey pulled away in the end winning 4 and 3. Club maker Paxton was an expert club and ball maker, his clubs being highly desirable in his day and beyond. Not unlike other golfers of his era, he began as a caddie at Musselburgh. He apprenticed as a club maker under David Park, the brother of Willie Park, Sr. In addition to the tutelage he received under David Park, he also picked up a few useful skills when he later apprenticed under Tom Hood. He took a job as the professional from his brother John at Malvern‚Äôs Worcestershire Club and was later posted at Royal Eastbourne. Paxton exhibited considerable inventiveness when in 1892 he created a machine that would produce several thousand gutta-percha golf balls weekly. He received patents on a type of grip and also for square socketed clubs. Some of his clubs were made from an unusual type of hardwood that he called ‚Äúsylviac‚Äù, but it could possibly have been itauba. He left Royal Eastbourne in 1893‚Äîwith several skilled club makers joining him‚Äîand took up a new post at Tooting Bec. By this time, he had gained the royal patronage of the Duke and Duchess of York and therefore placed a crown mark on the clubs he made. Balls, clubs and other items made by Paxton were displayed on the golf stall at the Sports and Pastimes Exhibition at the Crystal Palace in 1893.[s.n.] (August 1893). Baily's Magazine of Sports and Pastimes, cited at Peter Paxton 1890s SF Putter. Northwest Hickory Players. Accessed August 2015.

It was designed by Andrea Giovanni Stombuco and built in 1881 by William Hanley. It was originally known as St Patrick's Church. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  St Francis Xavier Church was designed by architect Andrea Stombuco. The foundation stone for St Patricks's (as it was originally called) was laid on Sunday 15 August 1880 by Bishop of Brisbane James Quinn. The church was opened in Sunday 1 May 1881 by Bishop Quinn. Two major series of extensions and renovations have been made, the first by architects R. Coutts and Sons in 1915 and the second by Hubert van Hoof in the 1980s. Construction of the church is well-documented. Local stone came from a nearby quarry, believed to be in Stuart Street; parishioners carted the stone to the site as voluntary work. Most masonry work was carried out by William Hanley but was finished by day labour. Carpentry and painting were carried out by James Madden of Ipswich. The cedar was from Doorey's sawmill at Mount Mistake, and other timber from Reillys and Hancocks of Ipswich. The original front cedar door was painted red and the interior was entirely plastered, except for the ceiling which was lined with \\"Rosewood pine\\" painted dark blue. The original roof was Gospel Oak iron. The church was a substantial one; apart from St Mary's in Ipswich, other Catholic churches built in the Ipswich region at that time were simpler buildings of timber. The church was originally part of Ipswich parish but became a separate parish in 1892, the first priest being Fr Thomas Hayes. A school was started in 1910 and a convent was built in 1911 for Sisters of Mercy who taught at the school. The convent, a two-storey timber building, is still standing in Church Street opposite St Francis Xavier Church. A timber presbytery was built in the 1890s but demolished ; its position is marked by a flat area encircled by trees immediately to the west of the current brick presbytery. The church was renovated and extended in 1915 by contractor J.C. Hobbs of Brisbane, to a design by R Coutts and Sons. The main change was construction of a new apse of brick and two side sacristies; to connect the apse, an arch was cut in the stonework of the rear wall. Two side windows of the church were converted into double doors and the remaining six pairs were altered to allow them to be openable. A new altar rail was installed and a new porch was added at the front, floored in black-and-white tile and containing a leadlight window by Extons. The foundations were strengthened and the walls were tied with iron plates running the length of the building on each side. At this time, two major stained glass windows were installed in the side walls, one in memory of local school teacher John Carroll and the other in memory of Denis Gorman. The triple window on the western wall and other fittings, Stations of the Cross paintings and statues within the church are also memorials. The name of the church was changed to St Francis Xavier in the 1920s, apparently to avoid confusion as so many churches were named St Patrick's. Further changes occurred in the 1970s and 80s, prompted by changing liturgy and changing patterns of church-going. Externally, a light timber structure was built at the northern side entrance to provide a place where the congregation could gather after a service. This was designed by parishioner and local architect Hubert van Hoof. The building was also repaired at this time, including installation of a new floor. Internally, there have been numerous changes to the sanctuary area following the liturgical changes of the Second Vatican Council; the altar was moved and later reduced in size, and the altar rail was removed. The gallery at the western end has been removed. The current pews are not original, but were recently acquired from another church. New silky oak altar furniture was designed by architect Hubert van Hoof.  Description  Side view, 2015 St Francis Xavier is a traditional cruciform-plan Gothic Revival church of sandstone with steep gabled roof forms clad in corrugated galvanised iron. The western end has a small gabled entrance porch floored in black and white tiles, while the eastern end has an extended sanctuary and twin sacristies in brickwork. A contemporary timber-framed northern entry porch gives access from the carpark to the centre of the nave. Windows are of pointed arch design, some of which contain fine quality stained and coloured glass memorials. The nave is dominated by the large archway leading to the extended sanctuary. The raised sanctuary floor has been extended westward into the nave. Niches each side of the archway contain religious statues. The painted boarded ceiling follows the collar-tie roof form and exhibits steel tie-rod and roof bracing. The church pews are benches in light-coloured timber, low-backed and dating from possibly the 1970s. Other furniture includes a small timber altar of earlier date as well as new altar furniture in light-coloured silky oak (designed by architect Hubert van Hoof). The walls of the nave display paintings showing the Stations of the Cross and a memorial tablet honouring the first Parish Priest Fr Hayes. On the exterior walls above window height along each side is a steel strap extending the length of the stone work. The church is complemented by a parkland setting of mature trees, most notably tall hoop pines to the north, east and west. Early church entrance gates have survived at the Church Street boundary in front of the church. New school buildings are situated close to the southern side of the church and a brick presbytery and church office are situated to the north- east. These are not included within the heritage listing.  Heritage listing  St Francis Xavier Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The place demonstrates the pattern of development of the Goodna township and the desire of the Catholic community of the area in the 1880s to build a substantial local church The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is a good example of a Revival Gothic stone church of simple traditional form. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The church is prominently located near the major shopping area of Goodna and, with its setting of mature trees, has landmark qualities and contributes aesthetically to the streetscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It has had a strong association with the spiritual, social and educational life of the Goodna community since its construction in 1881. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It was built to the design of important architect Andrea Stombuco.  References   Attribution  External links * * Provides a detailed description of the church at its opening in 1881.

The film stars Keke Palmer, Cory Hardrict, Eric D. Hill and Quincy Brown. The film was executive produced by Queen Latifah for her production company Flavor Unit Films, Electric Republic and Jacavi Film. Brotherly Love was distributed by Freestyle Releasing and had a limited theatrical release in the United States on April 24, 2015. Plot Set in the city of Philadelphia and famed Overbrook High School, Brotherly Love follows star high school basketball player Sergio Taylor (Hill) as he struggles navigating the fame that comes with being a star athlete. Sergio's older brother June (Hardrict) saw his own basketball dreams fade away when he turned to the streets to provide for his family after the death of their father. Sergio's twin sister Jackie (Palmer) saw her ambitions of having a music career side tracked after unexpectedly falling in love with Chris (Quincy Brown). It starts with the brutal killing of five hill boys hanging out. Junior ‚ÄúJune‚Äù for short, wakes up and prepares Sergio for the day giving him some money. When they get to school Jackie (Keke Palmer) meets up with her two best friends Trina and Simone who is dating and has a child with June. They briefly talk about a boy named Chris from the hill and the upcoming school dance before Jackie goes off to the library. While there, Jackie meets Chris and he offers to drive her home, despite the warning that she is June's sister. When she gets home she is accosted by her mother, who is dealing with addiction since her father's passing. While rolling dice, June gets into a fight with Zip's cousin who declares the neighborhood for the hill until the mystery gun man is found. Sergio's friend, Dez tells Sergio and Sean about a plan to break in and steal some items from a house up the hill. Sean shows a bit of interest while Sergio is hesitant. Sergio is conflicted and he goes to his uncle Ron's barber shop for advice. Uncle Ron tells him that every child in Philadelphia has the potential but what they lack is the focus, he shouldn't end up like his father or brother he tells him. ‚Äúyour talent doesn‚Äôt determine your fate your action does‚Äù. Jackie is on her date with Chris who shows up late but makes up for it, when he surprises her by getting her studio time to record a song he wrote for her. Sergio meets up with June for late night practice. He literates his fears, June encourages him and reminds him of their plan to make it and leave the hood for good. Meanwhile, one of June's best friends Bunch is ambushed and killed. While returning from the court just outside their house, June and Sergio are ambushed. Sergio escapes but June is held and drag into the house down to the basement where he sleeps, and is robbed of all the money he had been saving. While getting dragged out, his mother comes down the stairs and is shot by one of the assailants. They continue dragging June out who is struggling, alerting the neighbors who come outside, forcing the assailants to abandon June in the street. Meanwhile, Jackie returns from her date with Chris and sees the police cars outside her home. She rushes to June, who tells her her mother had been shot and is on the way to the hospital. June gets angry when he sees Chris and tells him to leave. Sergio, June and Peanut (Bunch's brother) are together when June gets a call informing him about Bunch's killing. Time passes as their mother heals. Jackie and Chris continue to see each other. Jackie finds out she is pregnant and keeps it to herself. Sergio considers Dez's plan because he wants to help with the money problems. June warns Jackie to quit seeing Chris because of the war going on between them and the hill, she refuses stating the fact that it has nothing to do with her and Chris. June has a discussion with his mother, who says he has always been there for them showing strength and endurance. She tells him to look after himself and ease up on Jackie because she will end up despising him. Sergio wins his basketball season and June holds a surprise party in his favor. While at the party, Chris is outside saying he has information that might help June in finding the people responsible for shooting his mother and killing Bunch. Grateful, June quickly invites Chris in for the party. That night after the party June and Peanut follow the lead and end up killing them. They all prepare for the brook ball school dance. Chris and Jackie end up going together and they win prom king and queen. Dez and Sean convince Sergio, who is reluctant, to go steal from the house. He eventually agrees. They enter the house through the back door with the key Dez stole from the house some weeks earlier. They split up, Dez and Sean go carry the flat screen to the car, while Sergio goes upstairs for the jewelry and money. Unbeknownst to them, the house alarm had been triggered and the police arrive. While upstairs Sergio opens the drawers and takes nothing. Dez and Sean, while loading the TV in the car, get arrested. The officer enters the home sees and recognizes Sergio and sets him free, declaring the house clear. Meanwhile, at the dance June takes Chris outside and Jackie tells him when he comes back she has something to tell him. June expresses his gratitude, gives him money with no strings attached, and promises to look after him. Chris says he didn't mean to fall in love with Jackie and pulls out a gun and shoots June dead. It is revealed that Chris was there the night of the hill boys shooting and his cousin Omar was killed. June is revealed to be the mystery shooter. Having survived such an ordeal, Chris swore revenge. He sought after Jackie. Before their studio date he arranged the hit on Bunch and June, hence his late arrival. Chris tries to flee, but is trapped by the police and surrenders. Jackie is called outside by Simone to find June dead, as Sergio arrives. Two years later Sergio has taken up the role of June and has a successful career in basketball, living in a big mansion with his mother, Jackie and her daughter. He hands Jackie a letter written by Chris from prison. Jackie reads the letter which states Chris is full of regret, expressing how he loved Omar the way she loved June, how he wishes he never killed June because he put them through the same type of pain. He wishes how they could‚Äôve been married and even had a kid because he still loves her even if he never told her and tells her to live her dreams. Jackie cries while reading the letter. Sergio is at June's gravesite, before he enters his Bentley and drives off. Cast *Keke Palmer as Jackie *Cory Hardrict as June *Quincy Brown as Chris *Eric D.

High school career Diggs attended Angleton High School, where he played on the football team. As a member of the Angleton Wildcats, he primarily played cornerback and safety, but occasionally played quarterback on offense. Considered a four-star recruit by ESPN.com, Diggs was listed as the top-ranked cornerback in the nation in the Class of 2011. College career Diggs played college football at Texas from 2011-2014 under head coaches Mack Brown (2011-2013) and Charlie Strong (2014). He played in 52 career games, of which he started 49.

He finished eighth among all participating cornerbacks in the bench press, 12th in the short shuttle, and finished 19th among cornerbacks in the 40-yard dash. On March 24, 2015, Diggs attended Texas's pro day, but opted to stand on the majority of his combine numbers and only performed positional drills and broad jump. He added six inches to his broad jump from the combine (9'11\\"). At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Diggs was projected to be a seventh round pick by the majority of NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked the 10th best cornerback in the draft by Bleacher Report, was ranked the 21st best cornerback by WalterFootball.com, and was ranked the 30th best cornerback prospect in the draft by DraftScout.com. The Detroit Lions selected Diggs in the sixth round (200th overall) of the 2015 NFL Draft. He was the 26th cornerback drafted in 2015. Detroit Lions =2015= On May 7, 2015, the Detroit Lions signed Diggs to a four-year, $2.39 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $115,352.

Head coach Jim Caldwell named Diggs the backup nickelback, behind Nevin Lawson, to begin the regular season. He made his professional regular season debut in the Detroit Lions' season-opener at the San Diego Chargers and recorded two solo tackles in their 33‚Äì28 loss.

The rocket system consisted of a pair of solid fuel rockets with two types of warheads available. It was regarded as one of the most effective anti-tank platforms used in WWII. Production started in spring of 1944 and ended 20 December 1944 when Soviet troops captured the WM Factory. Development and operation In 1942 the Hungarian Institute of Military Science (HTI) began work to develop an easy to produce weapon capable of counteracting heavy Soviet tanks and armour. Germany had started work on a wire-guided missile but was unwilling to share the technology with Hungary. The 44M consisted of a launcher capable of holding two rockets with the gunner operating from weapon's left side. A tripod was developed for use by the three man crew on the ground, but this mount was difficult to maneuver and rocket crews often used captured Soviet wheel mounts from the PM M1910 or SG-43 Goryunov machine guns. The system was also mounted in the bed of the 38M Botond all-terrain truck and on the rear of the 38M Toldi II light tank. The first of two types of rockets produced was a High-explosive anti-tank warhead (HEAT) round known as ‚ÄôBuzog√°ny‚Äô (mace). With 4.2 kg of explosive, this shaped charge was capable of penetrating 300 mm of armour or concrete and destroy any type of heavy tank from a maximum distance of 1200 m. A high explosive (HE) projectile round was also available for use in an anti-personnel role referred to as ‚ÄôZ√°por‚Äô (rainfall, shower). Both types were spin-stabilized. Of the 600-700 twin rocket launchers produced, the majority were used for the defense of Budapest in late December 1944, referred to as the Siege of Budapest.

It was built in the early 1870s. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The present Franklyn Vale Homestead was erected in the early 1870s for Mr & Mrs Edward Crace, son-in-law and daughter of Henry Mort, the owner of the property. It replaced an 1849 slab dwelling, which then was used as a stables until demolished c.1949. Originally, Franklyn Vale Station was part of the Laidley Plains leasehold which, along with Beau Desert, was taken up as a sheep run in 1843 by NSW squatter JP Robinson. The Laidley Plains run extended across the Franklin Valley, named after Sir John Franklin, Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen's Land 1837-43, and identified on Dixon's 1842 map of the Moreton Bay district. In 1849 the lease and 13,000 sheep passed to Sydney businessman Thomas Sutcliffe Mort. His brother, Henry Jonathan Mort, who had been managing Cressbrook Station in the Brisbane River Valley for DC McConnel, then moved onto Laidley Plains as manager. In the early 1850s Henry began the conversion of Laidley Plains into a cattle station. In 1852 the lease was transferred to Henry Mort and his brother-in-law James Laidley, with Henry managing the Franklyn Vale section of the run, and James managing the remainder as Laidley Plains. This partnership was dissolved in late 1869, by which time government resumptions had reduced Franklyn Vale to about freehold. Henry Mort removed his family to Sydney in 1855, where he joined his brother in Mort & Co. (later Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. Ltd), and thereafter resided only intermittently at Franklyn Vale, which was run by managers. However, he maintained a strong interest in Queensland, representing West Moreton in the NSW Legislative Assembly prior to the separation of Queensland. From 1871 to 1876 Edward Kendall Crace, Henry's son-in-law, resided at Franklyn Vale as managing partner. The Mort family understands the present homestead was erected for Mrs Crace. were resumed from the Franklyn Vale property and offered for selection on 17 April 1877. By 1891 Franklyn Vale was owned jointly by Henry Mort and his sons Charles Franklyn and Arthur Edward Lisle. Charles had been associated with Franklyn Vale as bookkeeper/overseer from about 1872. In the 1890s he developed the district's dairy industry, establishing a creamery and butter factory at Grandchester c.1893. Arthur took over the management of Franklyn Vale, which ultimately became his home, in 1891. In the 1890s he acquired his brother's interest in the property, and after his father's death in 1900, became sole owner. He developed Herefords and dairy cattle at Franklyn Vale, but mainly used the run as a fattening depot for his two other Queensland cattle properties: Redbank in the Burnett and Avoca in the Brisbane Valley. In late 1900, established Brisbane architects Addison & Corrie were commissioned to design a school room and guest wing for the homestead, and to undertake minor alterations. It is likely the shingled roof was covered with the present galvanised iron and that the kitchen was enlarged at this time. Mr & Mrs Arthur Mort also improved the garden and are believed to have engaged architect Robin Smith Dods to design the summerhouse. The homestead remains the property of their descendants.  Description  left Franklyn Vale Homestead is a single-storeyed weatherboard building with a projecting kitchen wing and a servants wing forming a northern courtyard. It sits on the crest of a low hill and has substantial early formal gardens, mature trees, including two lines of bunya trees at the eastern and western perimeters. There is a tennis court to the south. The main section of the building has twin corrugated iron hipped roofs with a central box gutter and is surrounded by verandahs with skillion roofs. The two wings have corrugated iron broken hipped roofs with verandahs to the courtyard. A chamferboard schoolroom with a corrugated iron gambrel roof is attached to the north end of the servants wing and a chamferboard bedroom wing with a corrugated iron gable roof is attached to the southeast corner of the main house. The building sits on timber stumps and has a windmill pump in the centre of the courtyard and an arched entrance gate. The perimeter verandahs have timber lattice balustrade and boarded ceilings. Timber shingles are visible below the corrugated iron roofs of the courtyard verandahs and lattice panels screen the kitchen verandah. French doors with fanlights and screens open to the verandahs, with the bedroom wing having panelled timber doors. The bedroom wing and schoolroom have tall sash windows with timber framed gauze shutters and the schoolroom has a boarded chimney Internally, walls are painted horizontal timber boards with stained timber fanlights, doors, architraves, skirting and picture rails. A bay with French doors opens off the lounge and fireplaces have timber surrounds. Ceilings are boarded, with some roses, and floors are carpeted. The kitchen has exposed roof framing with timber shingles visible below corrugated iron, a central brick double fireplace and walls are single-skin. The servants wing is also single-skin, has window hoods to the west and has a large shower head, originally operated by a cord to release tank water. The schoolhouse has a high boarded ceiling with pitched corners and a fretwork rose. The large fireplace has a timber surround and houses a stove. A weatherboard meathouse with a corrugated iron pyramid roof and ventilator is located to northwest. It has a separate, internal, timber frame and gauze structure with meat hooks and a concrete floor. A stained timber post-and-beam summerhouse with a corrugated iron pyramid roof and ventilator is located to the southwest near the tennis court. It has a boarded ceiling above the rafters, and single- skin vertically jointed infill boards, with fixed glazing above to the rear, and a solid balustrade with timber gates to the front. A slab timber shed with a shingle gabled roof is located to the north, with a lean-to the north and east. The shed consists of timber posts with horizontal slab infill fixed into central grooves. A tankstand is located at the western end with a small structure below. The grounds include a small weatherboard cottage to the northwest, sitting on timber stumps with a corrugated iron gabled roof and a front verandah. There is also a timber garden shed with a corrugated iron gabled roof and solid timber balustrade. The furniture contained within the homestead is excluded from the cultural heritage significance of the homestead.  Heritage listing  Franklyn Vale Homestead, 1992 Franklyn Vale Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Franklyn Vale Homestead and associated outbuildings and grounds is important in demonstrating the evolution and pattern of European settlement in the West Moreton district since the 1870s. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The s slab shed demonstrates a now rare aspect of Queensland's cultural heritage, namely the principal characteristics of 19th century bush technology and building practices, which are no longer common. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The 1870s homestead and slab building, the 1900s additions, the summerhouse and the formal garden, form a cohesive group which together demonstrate in their intactness and in their arrangement of elements, the principal characteristics of a south east Queensland homestead complex of the late 19th and 20th centuries. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The relationship of the buildings in scale, form and materials, their siting in the landscape and relationships with the surrounding established gardens, exhibit an aesthetic quality valued by the local community and those interested in Queensland homesteads and their gardens. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Franklyn Vale Homestead has a special association with the Mort family and their contribution to the development of the Queensland pastoral industry since 1849.

He was a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Council.  Early life  Henry Mort was born on 23 December 1818 at Willowfield, Bolton, Lancashire, England, the son of Jonathon Mort and his wife Mary (n√©e Sutcliffe). He was educated in Manchester and came to Australia in 1840. From about 1841 to 1855 he was one of the pioneers in the Moreton Bay district (now the State of Queensland) working on pastoral stations. He was manager of Cressbrook Station in the Brisbane River Valley for David Cannon McConnel. Then in 1849, his brother Thomas Sutcliffe Mort leased the Laidley Plains pastoral station and appointed Henry Mort as manager. Henry Mort converted the station from sheep to cattle. In 1852, Henry Mort and his brother-in-law James Laidley took over the lease with Mort managing the Franklyn Vale portion of the station. On 6 My 1846 he married Maria Laidley, the daughter of James Laidley (senior), in St James' Church, Sydney. In 1855, Henry Mort moved to Sydney and became a partner in his brother's woolbroking business Mort & Co, later Goldsbrough Mort & Co. He was involved in many insurance companies and banks and one of the promoters of the Sydney Meat Preserving Company. Politics Mort represented West Moreton (then part of New South Wales) in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from June 1859 to the seat's abolition with the separation of Queensland in December 1859. He then represented West Macquarie from December 1859 to November 1860. He was appointed a lifetime Member of the New South Wales Legislative Council on 22 Aug 1882. Later life Henry Mort donated ¬£3,000 to the construction of All Saints Anglican Church in Ocean Street, Woollahra; Mort lived in that street and his eldest son Henry Wallace Mort was the rector of the church. Mort died from pneumonia at his residence Anglesea, Ocean Street, Woollahra, Sydney on 6 September 1900 aged 81 years. His funeral proceeded from his Woollahra residence to the All Saints Church and then to the St Jude's Church and Cemetery for burial. Legacy The now heritage- listed Franklyn Vale Homestead in Grandchester, Queensland was established on Henry Mort's Franklyn Vale property in the early 1870s for his daughter and son-in-law, Edward Crase. Henry Mort was an occasional visitor to the property. The locality of Mount Mort in the vicinity of the homestead is named after the Mort family. All Saints Anglican Church is a heritage building.

He signed with Mavin Records in 2014 and left the label in 2018. He went by the stage name Spicy prior to his record deal with Mavin Records. Reekado Banks was declared Rookie of the Year at The Headies 2014, and won the controversial Next Rated award at The Headies 2015. His debut studio album Spotlight was released on 1 September 2016; it debuted at number 10 on the Billboard World Albums chart. Life and career Reekado Banks is the last child of a music-loving family. His father is a pastor from Ondo State and his mother is a caterer. Moreover, his elder brother is a producer and his elder sister is a gospel singer. He grew up in a disciplinarian setting due to both of his parents being pastors. He completed his secondary school at the age of 14, and started recording his first set of songs in 2008. His elder brother produced all of his earlier songs and tutored him on the rudiments of singing, writing and producing. He derived the stage name Reekado Banks by combining the meanings of the two names; the former part of his stage name translates to \\"strong ruler\\", while the latter part loosely translates to \\"wealth\\". In 2014, Reekado Banks graduated from the University of Lagos with a degree in history and strategic study. He has cited Don Jazzy, 2face Idibia, DJ Jimmy Jatt, Olamide and M.I as his key musical inspirations. Mavin Records deal and artistry His record deal with Mavin Records came as a result of his brother submitting some of his songs to the label in an online talent search. Reekado Banks got signed to Mavin Records after his entries were selected from over 5000 entries. In an interview with the National Mirror, he said his brother submitted his songs and communicated with the label on his behalf without his initial consent. Reekado Banks also told the National Mirror he's a versatile artist who makes music with the thought that humans are different and have different taste. 2014‚Äìpresent: Singles and Mavin Records departure Reekado Banks premiered the single \\"Turn It Up\\" on 21 February 2014, which coincided with the day he signed with Mavin Records. The song features Tiwa Savage and was released as his first official single under Mavin Records. Reekado Banks was featured on the critically acclaimed song \\"Dorobucci\\", alongside Don Jazzy, Korede Bello, Tiwa Savage, Di'Ja, Dr SID and D'Prince. Reekado Banks also worked with some of the aforementioned artists to release three collaborative singles: \\"Adaobi\\", \\"Arise\\" and \\"Looku Looku\\". On 13 February 2015, he released the Don Jazzy- produced song \\"Katapot\\". It was alleged to be a diss track towards D'banj and Wande Coal. In February 2015, Don Jazzy debunked the allegations in a series of tweets. While speaking to Vanguard newspaper, Reekado Banks said he created \\"Katapot\\" for his fans. In July 2015, Nigerian telecommunications company Globacom signed Reekado Banks to an endorsement deal. On December 7, 2018, he announced his departure from Mavins Records after 5 years.

Kaitangata Mine Memorial to the 1879 mining disaster Coal was discovered in the area around near Kaitangata in the late 1840s and William Aitchinson began extracting coal near Kaitangata in 1862.To the Editor, Otago Daily Times, Issue 235, 20 September 1862, Page 6 In 1871 he leased his mine to John Thompson of Balclutha.Balclutha, Bruce Herald, Volume VI, Issue 367, 10 May 1871, Page 6 In September 1872 Thompson and Aitchenson reached agreement to raise capital to expand their mining operation by way of a new company, the Kaitangata Coal Mining Company.Miscellaneous, Bruce Herald, Volume VI, Issue 437, 25 September 1872, Page 2 The underground mine produced sub-bituminous coal of a high quality. In 1875, the Company merged with the recently created Kaitangata Railway Company to become the Kaitangata Railway and Coal Company Ltd. Through late 1875 and early 1876 the mine was expanded with additional shafts being driven in anticipation of the new railway.The Kaitangata Railway, Clutha Leader, Volume II, Issue 89, 23 March 1876, Page 6 Once the railway had been completed the company announced further expansion intentions with a desire by 1877 to bring production up to 100 tons per week.Opening of the Kaitangata Branch Railway and Coal Pits, Otago Daily Times , Issue 4471, 17 June 1876, Page 3 There were 41 men employed at the mine in mid-1877.The coal mines of Otago, West Coast Times , Issue 2661, 10 October 1877, Page 3 On 8 September 1878 there was a small explosion in the mine. The Manager Mr Thorne was burnt by the explosion while he was inspecting a minor rock fall. Two other miners suffered from minor injuries.Accidents and offences, Otago Daily Times, Issue 5181, 25 September 1878, Page 2 At that time it was thought that the coal in New Zealand was not prone to emit gas and such precautions as were necessary were in place. Accident At 8am on 21 February 1879 there was an explosion at the Kaitangata mine. The force of the explosion was enough to blow Edward Dunn, who was entering the drive with a horse, 50 yards clear killing him. Terrible colliery explosion in Otago, Wanganui Herald, Volume XII, Issue 9351, 21 February 1879, Page 3 Six empty coal trucks were also projected a similar distance from the drive. A building for storing tools near the mine entrance was back several yards and partially demolished by some of the coal trucks.Fatal colliary explosion at Kaitangata, Bruce Herald, Volume XI, Issue 1091, 25 February 1879, Page 5 A second boy James Hawke, who was near the entrance, and blown a similar distance to Dunn escaped serious injury. Dense smoke was seen issuing from the mine. Initially it was thought that there were only 36 men inside the mine at the time.Fearful Mining Catastrophe at Kaitangata, Otago Daily Times, Issue 5308, 22 February 1879, Page 3 Rescue attempts Immediately after the explosion the station master, J B Griffen, sent the company's train to Balclutha to get Dr Smith. He arrived on the scene some 25 minutes later. While this was happening, men from the neighbouring mines gathered and organised a group of volunteers to either rescue the miners or recover their bodies. Fire damp initially prevented rescuers from entering the mine. Those first entering the mine were W Shore, R M Sewell, Mr Aitcheson, and some unnamed others. They found two falls in the mine, which had been caused by the explosion. Also the brattices which allowed air circulation had been destroyed and temporary canvas ones needed to be installed prior to further searching. Several of those installing the canvas ones were almost suffocated. The condition in the mine remained dangerous and those working in it had to do so in shifts because of the impact of after damp. All hope of finding the miners alive was abandoned at this point. The Company Manager, James Davidson, Mr Watson, and the mining engineer Mr Twinning were in Dunedin when the explosion occurred and on learning of it took the 11:25am train to Stirling. On the information they had when they left Dunedin they had no idea of the scale of the disaster until the arrived at Stirling. There they were informed that some 30 or more men, including the mine Manager William Hodge were in the mine when the explosion occurred and that none were likely to be alive. By 12pm one body and the youngest person killed, 14-year-old Charles McDonald, was recovered from the mine but he could only be identified by his clothing as he was so badly burnt. Two more, William Hay and Edward Beardsmore were recovered by 12:25pm. James Beardsmore Junior was the next one recovered. All three had been killed by the after damp. Thomas Black, George Jarvie, Thomas Frew, and Caleb Beardsmore were next, bringing the total to 8 by 1:35pm. At the same time Mr Farra, a Company Director, telegraphed the Company Secretary, Mr Horkins to get 20 Green Island miners to assist in recovery operations. Constable Warren telegraphed at 1:40pm stating that in addition to the 8 bodies recovered another 28 were still in the mine. None were expected to be alive. The scene at the mine entrance at 1:30pm was described as lamentable with weeping women and children at the scene.Frightful Mining Accident, West Coast Times, Issue 3092, 22 February 1879, Page 2 A morgue was set up at Jenkin's hotel, with Constable Warring taking charge of the bodies as they emerged. The rescuers had to take a break at 1:30pm due to the mine air being to contaminated. Constable Warren telegraphed at 1:40pm stating that in addition to the 8 bodies recovered another 28 were still in the mine. After a short time work resumed again and by 7pm another 16 bodies were removed from the mine - R Hall and his brother J Hall, David Buchanan, James Molloy and his two sons John and Edward Molloy, James Beardsmore (senior), William Whinney, Joseph Beardsmore, Joseph Morton, Barney McGee, James Clinning, William Hodge the Mine Manager, William S Wilson, and William Watson. Four other bodies were sighted. James Davidson and Mr Twinning arrived during the afternoon and Mr Twinning was appointed by Davidson to manage the operations. Among the rescuers Messrs Shore, Sewell, Aitcheson, William Blain, Thomas Knowles, John Gray, John McFarlane of Wangaloa, the Bissetts - a father and two sons, William Law, Joseph Robertson, and John Nelson were singled out for praise. To this list were later added J Brown, James Wilson, Robert Wilson, Charles Samson, Michael Muir, George Hunter, Messrs Hennessy and Richardson, William Wilson, Adam Harris, Alexander Cook, John Tiffen, Hugh Wilson, James McIvor, William Hodgkiss, Andrew Falkener, and Stephen Russell. At 6:45pm Charles Samson the Mayor of Green Island and 24 miners from the Green Island mines arrived by special train to assist. Thomas Logan, a quartz miner joined the group of miners to assist. Archibald (Archie) Hodge the Deputy Mine Manager was noted to be among those not yet found. Most of the bodies had been found close to the main air intake about 300 yards from the entrance. They were thought to have suffocated. By the end of the day 30 bodies had been recovered and 4 were known to be still missing. The names of the remaining miners killed were Samuel Coulter, James Spiers, Andrew Jarvie, Thomas Smith, John Gage, John Clark, John Ferguson, Robert McMillan, and Daniel Lockhart. Andrew Jarvie was the only one of this group killed by the blast. The rest died of asphyxiation. The Presbyterian and Anglican Ministers Reverends Allan and Carr, had arrived in the afternoon to assist the grieving families and Police Commissioner Thomas Weldon, Inspector Moore, and a number of officers arrived to assist Constable Warren. Reverends Ronaldson and Chisholm from Milton also arrived to assist the grieving. Allan, Ronaldson, Chisholm and the Roman Catholic Priest Father Larkins officiate at the funeral the following day.The funeral, Bruce Herald, Volume XI, Issue 1091, 25 February 1879, Page 5 Twenty of the miners were married and several were new arrivals, having arrived the day before on the steamer Wellington. On the day of the explosion, 47 men were employed at the mine. One miner who had overslept, C Hunter, escaped death. The location and cause of the explosion Those who had signs of physical injury were at the mine entrance or in its vicinity. The remainder of those killed had been working in the new working and had no apparent physical injuries. Because of this a conclusion was reached that seat of the explosion had been in the area near the mines entrance and most probably in the area of the old workings. Conclusive evidence for this theory had been found when Archibald Hodge's mangled body had been found within the old workings. The old workings were locked off by a door from the main mine. Hodge had, for some reason opened the door and entered this area. Fire damp was probably present and because Hodge was using a naked flame to light his path, ignited it and caused the catastrophic explosion. There were two suggested reasons for Hodge entering this dangerous area. One was that he wanted to remove some disused rails lying in the old workings and the other was he was eccentric and considered the old working as an area where there was some mystery to be unraveled. Coroners Court Inquest report for one of the victims A Coroners Court was convened at the Bridge Hotel Kaitangata at 12:20pm on Saturday 22 February to determine the cause of the deaths under Edgar Hall Carew RM of Milton, Coroner. A jury of 16 had been selected. They were Alexander Mitchell, David Dunn - the jury foreman, John Walker, William Bissett, William Carson, George Kidd, Hugh McFarlane, John Gordon, Allan Blackie, Charles Smaill, Andrew Smaill, Joseph Robertson, Alexander Bissett, P F Stoddart, James Muir, and Malcolm Morrison. Police Commissioner Weldon and Inspector Moore were also in attendance. The court began with the identification of the bodies by Thomas Knowles - Pit Headman, Joseph Robertson, David Dunn, and John McDonald. Only Archie Hodge and Jarvie remained unidentified at the end of the day. The hearing recommenced on the Monday at 11am when the remaining bodies identified. Charles Edward Twining, a qualified colliary manager and the mining surveyor with the Company was called to give evidence. He advised that in his opinion the mine should have had a second outlet and had recommended it. He stated that in England there was a requirement that there should be two outlets as a minimum, the air vent did not count as an outlet. There should also have been a barometer in the mine and outside to determine the presence of bad air. Locked lamps or safety lamps were required when fire damp was suspected as being present. William Hodge and Beardsmore had advised Twining about 2 weeks before the explosion of fire damp being present in the new working. Twining checked but found none. An inspection of the mine was carried out on 1 February by Mr Cox, the Government Assistant Geologist and Mr Binnes the Government Coal Inspector. Binnes drew out plans for the Mine Manager on how best to work the mine.The Inquest, Southland Times , Issue 3333, 25 February 1879, Page 2The Kaitangata catastrophe, Otago Daily Times , Issue 5311, 26 February 1879, Page 5 After Twining was heard, Robert Grigor - Land Surveyor took the stand followed by William Wilson, one of the miners. Wilson stated that fire damp had been present in the mine from time to time since October 1878. Precautions had been taken and the mine was considered reasonably safe. He advised that in England areas of old working were usually bricked off and sealed to prevent build ups of fire damp - entering that area of the mine was considered unsafe, although Archie Hodge had been into the area to get some rails on occasion. He also recalled that Andrew Javie had been burnt in a minor explosion about three months earlier at the east end of the workings. The miners used naked lights unlike the English miners who used the safety lamps. Wilson considered that the most likely source of the explosion was the old workings as there would not enough buildup of fire damp in new workings to cause an explosion of such magnitude. John Irving, another miner gave a similar testimony and suggested that Hodge may have entered the old area to find more rails. He also said that he did not think Hodge was able to assess the danger in the old workings. The hearing was then adjourned. The hearing recommenced on Monday 3 March with Joseph Robertson identifying the body of William Parker Hall. He was followed by Thomas Knowles who was working at the mine site on the 21st. He described the explosion. Knowles had also talked to Archie Hodge who he said had got some rails for Andrew Jarvie and Walter Hay to lay a new road 300 yards opposite the old workings. Hodge had told him that he needed a pair of turnings. As there were none outside, Knowles thought Hodge would have gone in to the old workings to retrieve some. Given the time between talking to Hodge and the explosion (about 10 minutes) Knowles thought Hodge had probably entered the old workings and caused the explosion. Next on the stand was Charles Samson, a Director of the Green Island Coal Company and Manager of the Abbotsfield Coal Mine. Samson considered the mine should have had a second access and that the old workings should have been sealed off, as was the practice in England. He considered that accessing the old workings, given the presence of fire damp in the mine, was reckless. Samson was followed by Samual Herbert Cox, New Zealand Government Inspector of Mines and holder of a Competency Certificate from the London School of Mines. The Mine Manager, Hodge, had informed him in February that there was no fire damp present in the mine. Binns, the Coal Inspector had been through the old workings about 8 days earlier and had not reported any fire damp present. He did not think Hodge was experienced enough to be a Mine Manager without supervision. Samson also stated that old workings should only be accessed with a safety lamp. After these witnesses two of the company officers took the stand, James Davidson - General Manager and Matthew William Hawkings - Company Secretary. Safety lamps had been ordered for the mine and a barometer had been provided to Hodge. The hearing was then adjourned till the next week. On resumption of the hearing on 10 March William Shore - Manager of the No1 Kaitangata Mine took the stand. Shore had found Archie Jarvis' body in the old workings. He was also certain that the explosion had been caused in these workings. George Jonathan Binns, a qualified mining engineer and viewer of coal for the New Zealand Government took the stand next. He had inspected the old workings and considered that they had the potential to be dangerous. He had informed Hodge. Hodge had told him on 24 January that no gas was present in the mine. If gas was present in the mine then the old working should have been sealed off. The alternative and what had happened was gross negligence on behalf of the Mine Manager. Binns did not have the authority to require the Mine Manager to take any action. He did report the situation to his superiors and had, after the explosion, found that the gas had again built up to dangerous levels in the old workings. Binns was later recalled and asked if the gas in the old workings could have come from the new ones. He advised that this was not likely and that it was from the old workings.The Kaitangata catastrophe, Otago Daily Times, Issue 5322, 11 March 1879, Page 3 Allan Holmes, Company Director, took the stand following Binns. He was asked whether he knew about the gas. He said that Holmes had told him in either July or August 1878. Hodge had taken quite a casual attitude to it and Holmes had asked him to institute safety lamps. Beardsmore had been tasked with inspecting the mine for fire damp prior to letting the men enter the mine. In January 1879 safety lamps had been ordered. After his evidence the Coroner provided instructions to the jury, before they retired to consider their verdict, on what they needed to determine. After 50 minutes the jury returned with a finding: > First, your Worship, the Jury find that Archibald Hodge, through entering > the old workings without ordinary precaution and with a naked light, caused > an explosion of fire-damp whereby 34 men and boys lost their lives. Second, > the Jury find That William Hodge has not used the necessary precautions to > prevent an explosion of fire-damp in the mine over which he had the > management. As a rider, we add that seeing that there is no law for > inspection and supervision in the conduct of mining, we express the > necessity of measures being adopted whereby many accidents may in the future > be averted. Mine Inspectors and Legislation Before the Coroner's Court had reached its conclusions a local paper raised the issue of the quality of New Zealand's Mine Inspectors by noting that in England they were highly educated and paid accordingly, while in New Zealand they were only paid ¬£150 per annum. This was later followed by a call on the Government to enforce its mining legislation.Dormant Acts of Parliament, Evening Post, Volume XVII, Issue 371, 18 March 1879, Page 2 The Act in force at the time of the explosion was the Regulation of Mines Act 1874. The Act was only enforcible if the Superintedent of the Province had, by Proclamation published in the New Zealand Gazette declared the Act to be in force in the province. The only alternative was if the Governor had proclaimed a Mining District and Published that in the Gazette. Section 10 of the Act required two openings for egress. Section 36 of the Act also made provision for owners to compensate those injured or killed through negligence.Regulation of Mines Act 1874 The Government's response to the disaster was to reasonably promptly issue a Proclamation bringing the Act into force throughout the country on 28 February 1879.Editorial, Evening Post, Volume XVII, Issue 357, 1 March 1879, Page 2 Attention in the newspapers of the time turned towards the Directors of the company, notwithstanding the Coroners Court finding negligence by the Hodges. The newspapers pointed out that the Directors had left William Hodge, the Mine Manager, to do pretty much as he liked, had shirked their duty of care, and suggested the Government should examine them. The papers further suggested that the Directors had not done sufficient in determining Hodge's competency. Enabling the Mine inspectors was lauded and more inspectors were called for.Telegrams, Otago Daily Times, Issue 5324, 13 March 1879, Page 2 Shore's Mine After the hearings Thomas Thompson Ritchie wrote to Dr James Hector about the possibility that the gas build up in the old workings could have been caused by new workings in the adjacent No 1 Kaitangata mine of Mr Shore. Ritchie had deduced that water build up in the mine had ceased around the time of the explosion and that there was a cross fault between the two mines which linked to the area in the old workings and which could have caused the gas build up. Shore's mine was at a lower level than the Company's and the gas tended to rise. He also pointed out that the buildup of gas after the explosion was considerably more rapid than would have been expected in the old workings area. Dr Hector agreed with the analysis.The Kaitangata Explosion, Clutha Leader, Volume V, Issue 290, 21 March 1879, Page 6 Mr Shore rebutted the claim, stating that his mine was 500 yards away and 450 (yards or feet) below the Companies mine. He further stated that there was no reliable evidence to supported Ritchie and Hector's assertion and that gas transfer through a fault at that distance was inconsistent with evidence from other mine faults. Shore further pointed out that the ventilation system at the Companies mine had not been operational since the explosion and that it was more likely that a lack of ventilation was the cause of the buildup given that fire damp was known to be present in the mine.To the editor, Clutha Leader, Volume V, Issue 290, 21 March 1879, Page 6 Relief fund A relief fund was set up after the disaster to assist the miners' widows. Among those donating were Chinese miners from the Adam's Flat gold diggings, who gave 10 shillings each on average.Editorial, Bruce Herald, Volume XI, Issue 1098, 25 March 1879, Page 5 References Category:Coal mining disasters in New Zealand Category:Clutha District Category:1879 in New Zealand Category:1879 mining disasters ","title":"Kaitangata Mine disaster"},{"id":"46404589","text":"Acria eulectra is a moth in the family Depressariidae.

She was the President of the American Genetics Association in 2018 and was previously President of the International Biogeography Society 2013-2015. Fom 2011-2013 she had served at the president of the American Arachnological Society. As of 2020 the faculty director of the Essig Museum of Entomology and a Professor and Schlinger Chair in systematic entomology at the University of California, Berkeley. She is known for her work on the evolution of communities on hotspot archipelagoes.  Education and previous employment  She was born and raised in Scotland. She received her B.SC in Zoology at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, and her Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Tennessee-Knoxville in 1986. She went on to work as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Hawaii, working closely with The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii, and based on Maui. She also spent a year at the University of the South, Sewanee, Tennessee. She took an appointment of Assistant Professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 1992. She left Hawaii and moved to the University of California at Berkeley in 1999.  Research  Her research program is aimed at understanding what drives biological diversification, particularly at the level of populations and species. She uses islands of known age and isolation to assess the combined temporal and spatial dimension of biogeography and determine patterns of diversification, adaptive radiation, and associated community assembly with a focus on spiders and insects. Most of her work has been in the Hawaiian Islands, though she has also worked in French Polynesia, Fiji, Pohnpei, and Kosrae. Themes include adaptive radiation and community assembly on islands with emphasis on patterns of repeated evolution of similar forms, the rate of species accumulation and approach to equilibrium within an island system, and mechanisms of dispersal to the islands. Most of her work has been on spiders, in particular species in the genus Tetragnatha (Tetragnathidae). She also works on the evolution of diversity within species, with the primary focus here on color polymorphism in the Hawaiian Happy face spider which has evolved the same color polymorphism independently on different islands, and the research aims to uncover the molecular basis for the modification. She currently has a large program examining the importance of priority, sequence, abundance, and interaction strengths in determining how biological communities develop, and how this might render them resilient to intrusion by non native species.  Science communication  She led \\"Exploring California Biodiversity\\" (2003-2016), a National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded museum and field-based outreach program focused on graduate fellows and high- school/middle-school students in minority-dominated urban schools in the Bay Area. The project forged connections between the university and the surrounding community, enriching K-12 science education, and training graduate students to be better communicators of science. Prior to moving to UC Berkeley she was part of an effort for Using Hawaii‚Äôs Unique Biota for Biology Education, an NSF program that worked with underrepresented Pacific Island students. She also led or co-led several programs to encourage participation of underrepresented minorities in higher education, including an NSF-funded Undergraduate Mentoring in Environmental Biology program that encouraged Pacific Islander undergraduates to undertake field and laboratory research in biology. She was awarded NSF‚Äôs Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM) in Nov 2005.

Its leaves are arranged in whorls of three around the stems and are long and wide, linear or a very narrow oval shape with a blunt point on the end. Oil glands are distinct on the lower surface. The flowers are arranged in a short spike or head at the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering and sometimes in the upper leaf axils. The spikes contain 15 to 50 individual flowers and are up to in diameter. The flowers are a light cream colour and each is surrounded by five bundles of stamens, containing 3 to 8 stamens. The petals are long and often tinged with pink. Spring is the main flowering season and the flowers are followed by fruit which are woody capsules about long and wide, in clusters along the branches. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca parvistaminea was first formally described in 1984 by Norman Byrnes in Austrobaileya. The specific epithet (parvistaminea) is derived from the Latin words parvus meaning \\"little\\" and stamen meaning \\"thread\\" referring to the stamens which are short compared to those of other melaleucas. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca parvistaminea occurs from the Shoalhaven district in New South Wales south to the Seymour district in Victoria.

United States, 574 U.S. 528 (2015), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court construed 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1519, a provision added to the federal criminal code by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to criminalize the destruction or concealment of \\"any record, document, or tangible object\\" to obstruct a federal investigation.. By a 5-to-4 vote, the Court stated that the term \\"tangible object\\" as used in this section means an object used to record or preserve information, and that this did not include fish.Yates v. United States, .  Background  Petitioner John L. Yates, a commercial fisherman, was operating in the Gulf of Mexico when a federal agent conducted an offshore inspection and found that the ship's catch had undersized red grouper, in violation of United States federal conservation regulations. The federal agent instructed Captain Yates to keep the undersized fish segregated; Yates instructed his crew to throw the undersized fish overboard, resulting in Yates being charged under 18 United States Code ¬ß1519. This provision, originating from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, states that a person may be fined or imprisoned for up to 20 years if the person \\"knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence\\" a federal investigation. At trial, Yates sought an acquittal for the ¬ß1519 charge arguing that fish were not tangible objects related to record-keeping. The District Court denied the acquittal motion. Yates was found guilty by a jury of violating ¬ß1519 and sentenced to 30 days' imprisonment. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the conviction, holding that fish have a physical form and are therefore a tangible object under a dictionary definition.  Opinion of the Court  Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg authored the plurality opinion, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, holding that \\"within ¬ß1519's compass,\\" a tangible object is \\"one used to record or preserve information.\\" Among other things, the plurality relied upon traditional canons of statutory construction including the canons noscitur a sociis (\\"a word is known by the company it keeps\\") and ejusdem generis (\\"general words following a list of specific words should usually be read in light of those specific words\\"), as well as the section's enactment as part of a statute dealing with financial fraud and its location within title 18. Associate Justice Samuel Alito filed a separate opinion concurring in the judgment.  Dissent  Associate Justice Elena Kagan, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas, dissented. Justice Kagan concluded that a tangible object is \\"any object capable of being touched.\\" Citing the United States Code and other U.S. laws, Kagan argued that tangible object \\"invariably covers physical objects of all kinds\\" and that the surrounding language of ¬ß1519 makes it clear that Congress \\"meant the term to have a wide range.\\" The dissenting opinion suggests that the plurality opinion acknowledges that a tangible object is \\"a discrete thing that possesses physical form.\\" Kagan continues this line of argument by holding that a fish \\"is, of course, a discrete thing that possesses physical form,\\" citing Dr. Seuss's book One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish (1960) as general evidence. Kagan's view is that under the \\"ordinary meaning of the term,\\" a tangible object in ¬ß1519 covers fish (including undersized red grouper).

It was built from 1875 to 1876. It is also known as Bigge's Camp. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Steam train at Grandchester Railway Station Queensland, circa 1879 Grandchester, originally known as Bigge's Camp, is the western terminus for the first railway in Queensland and the first section of the Main Line to Toowoomba, opened from Ipswich on 31 July 1865. Works were carried out to the station building in 1875 and 1876. The goods shed was also built in that year. T. Neville signed a contract to undertake work on the station buildings on 19 December 1878. The tank was relocated from Laidley in 1876 and a locomotive stationed here from 1885 to assist trains over the Little Liverpool Range. James Stewart signed a contract on 14 March 1885 to build an engine shed, and Worley and Whitehead signed a contract to build a second goods shed on 15 June 1885. The station master's house was built in 1910 and alterations carried out to the station building around that time. By 1961 the complex consisted of a station building with signal cabin, two tanks, cream shed, closet, pumphouse, station master's house, forkline to cattleyards, engine shed and coal stage. The engine shed had been demolished by 1963 and the trucking yards were discontinued in 1991. The station buildings are now operated by the Queensland branch of the National Trust of Australia. It is open to the public once a month, with volunteers offering guided tours.  Description  Grandchester railway station, circa 1915 Grandchester is in a predominately rural setting in a bend on the Western Creek. The station building is situated on a timber platform and adopts a unique architectural form with a hipped roof and peripheral verandah to all elevations, posted on the ends and roadside and carried on later plain brackets over the platform. There is a prominent central chimney stack with arched cowls (compare with the surviving station master's house at Wallangarra railway station (1887) and the former at Esk (1886)). External linings are rusticated with exposed faces and double hung windows without horns having glazing bards. Internal alterations have been extensive although evidence of the original two bedrooms, living room, waiting room and office is presumed to exist, especially in the form of early timber ceiling linings and cornices. There is a roll of honour board inside, painted by Hugh F. O'Brien, Toowoomba. There is a signal cabin with a 22 lever T-bar machine in the down end of the building, placed out of service presumably in 1988 with the introduction of centralized traffic control (CTC). The tank is a two tier cast iron tank altered from a single tier tank at an unknown date. The linings to the stand are recent and the shaped ends to the main beams project through the linings. There is an associated dam which is presumed to supply the tank, also a brick well and associated pumphouse. The station master's house is a standard elevated second class house with a pyramidal roof, peripheral verandah and (possibly later) ventilator. The verandah post enrichment may be uncommon, but the overall form is not uncommon.  Heritage listing  Grandchester Railway Complex was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Grandchester Railway complex has historical importance as the western terminus of the first railway in Queensland, opened on 31 July 1865. Grandchester as a place is commonly acknowledged to be an historical railway site of State significance. It was the first railway station built in Queensland using local materials. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The survival of a station building incorporating quarters is also rare (compare Clifton, Springsure and Pentland).

Recording began in 2011, and was mostly conducted at the home of vocalist Ronny Hansen. The album cover is a painting by Polish artist Zdzis≈Çaw Beksi≈Ñski, and depicts a deformed, many-fingered humanoid creature playing a trumpet. Antestor met with critical praise for its musicianship and the progressive sound on the recording. Critics described the sound as primarily black metal, though the band prefers the more general term \\"extreme metal\\" to describe the sound on Omen. To promote the album, the band went on tour in Brazil in January 2013, but encountered difficulties. The venue at Bel√©m was cancelled due to a banking error, and while at Belo Horizonte Antestor was stormed by violent protestors antagonistic to the Christian beliefs of the band members, and police had to usher the band to safety. Despite these setbacks, Antestor considered the tour a success, and wished no ill will on its attackers. On February 18, 2013, a music video was released for the song \\"Unchained\\". Background Lars Stokstad, sole remaining founding member of Antestor, seen here in 2011 at Elements of Rock, upright Antestor was founded in 1990 by Lars Stokstad, Kjetil Molnes, √òyvind Hope and Erling J√∏rgensen, under the name Crush Evil. After recording two demos and undergoing a lineup change which left Stokstad and Molnes as sole founding members, the band renamed itself as Antestor in 1993. Shunned by the early Norwegian black metal scene due to the band members' staunch Christian faith, Antestor struggled retaining a record deal. Its first album, Martyrium, was recorded in 1994 and had a few bootleg copies illegally distributed, but did not see legitimate release until 2000. Antestor's second album, The Return of the Black Death, was released in 1998 through Cacophonous Records, but the band claims that the label never paid Antestor any royalties for that album. In 2004 and 2005, respectively, the band released, under Endtime Productions, the EP Det tapte liv and the studio album The Forsaken, both of which featured session drum work by drummer Jan Axel Blomberg, known as Hellhammer,. who has played in strongly anti-Christian bands such as Mayhem and Immortal. Despite a positive reception to the album, after 2007 Antestor consisted only of Stokstad and vocalist Ronny Hansen, and the band went into hiatus. Several new members joined the band in 2010: Thor Georg Buer on bass, Jo Henning B√∏rven on drums, Robert Bordevik on guitar, and Nickolas Main Henriksen on keyboard.; ; ; Rehearsals began in June, and Antestor performed at Nordic Fest in Oslo on October 28 through October 30. On November 4, Antestor announced that it signed a record deal with Bombworks Records. Recording Except for drums and the folk music instrumental \\"Tilflukt\\", the album was entirely recorded at Hansen's home in Norway. Drums were recorded by B√∏rven at his home, while \\"Tilflukt\\" was recorded and mixed by Erik Normann Aanonsen and James William Makepeace at Salvation Room studios. In an interview with HM, Antestor explained that it had trouble finding a studio that it liked, as well as finding time when all members were available to record. Since Buer and B√∏rven had the necessary equipment to record, the band decided it would take on recording itself. The band stated that Buer \\"really took the brunt of the workload and singlehandedly made it possible for us to record the album ourselves.\\" Demo recording began in 2010, and Antestor uploaded a video clip from its recording sessions on September 4. During recording, bassist Thor Georg Buer left Antestor in May 2011 due to commitments to his other band, Grave Declaration, and Aanonsen was recruited as his replacement. A few months later, Buer rejoined, this time on guitar, to replace Robert Bordevik, who had temporarily left the band. On June 23, the Christian music website Indie Vision Music noted a video uploaded by Antestor that contained footage of the band recording. The recording process finished on July 31, 2012. On August 25, Buer announced that he was leaving Antestor again, this time due to upcoming college studies. In September, Erik Tordsson completed the mixing and mastering for Omen at Solid Mix Studios, Teleborg Castle, V√§xj√∂, Sweden. Music and lyrics The album is primarily black metal in sound, though still retains the thrash metal, doom metal, and folk music influences of previous releases by the band. On Omen, Antestor took a more brutal and experimental approach. Most of the vocals are screamed and growled, except \\"Unchained\\", which features a passage with sung vocals, which Andy Synn of No Clean Signing described as having a \\"strong Pink Floyd feel to them\\". Synn considered the album as a mixture of the aggressive assault of Dark Funeral with the more technical and atmospheric playing of Dark Fortress. Scott Waters, writing for HM, described the album as \\"progressive, post- black/extreme metal that paints a dark, sullen landscape with lyrics that offer hope.\\" Victimer, editor-in-chief for the Czech webzine Echoes, described Omen as black metal with influences from thrash metal. Antestor itself does not consider the album black metal, preferring instead the term \\"extreme metal\\". It explained to HM that \\"Treacherous Domain\\" contains slow, doom- inspired riffing, while \\"In Solitude,\\" \\"The Kindling,\\" and \\"Benighted\\" feature a more progressive, technical style of black metal. \\"Tilflukt\\" is a short folk instrumental which segues into the double-bass drumming of \\"Benighted\\". Synn described \\"Remnants\\" as developing \\"a harsh, angular pounding rhythm that would sit well on any Gorgoroth album\\"; \\"Tilflukt\\" as similar to the output of Windir, and \\"M√∏rket's Gr√∏de\\" as containing echoes of early Satyricon. Apart from the final track, \\"M√∏rket's Gr√∏de\\", and the instrumental, \\"Tilflukt\\", all song lyrics are written in English. Zuza Steck of the Polish magazine Musick Magazine noted the \\"unblack\\" ‚Äì Christian ‚Äì message of the lyrics and how Antestor demonstrates that a band can maintain an extreme atmosphere but take a different lyrical approach. Antestor expounded on the lyrical themes that \\"at the same time that we are Christians, we are also humans. I think almost everyone can relate to parts of our music and lyrics, for absolutely everyone ‚Äì Christians and non-believers alike ‚Äì experience hard and terrible times. The Lord does not say we will not meet hard times as Christians, but that He will be with us and carry us through it, and that is a big part of the Antestor message.\\" Artwork The album features a painting by Polish surrealist artist Zdzis≈Çaw Beksi≈Ñski. The painting depicts a deformed, humanoid creature with many fingers, playing a trumpet. The band explained that it decided on this picture because \\"Our music represents the more broken and monster-like feelings of our humanity, like the apparition in this picture. It seemed a very fitting cover for our return after seven years of silence.\\" Promotion and touring Ronny Hansen of Antestor at Blast of Eternity, Neckarsulm, Germany, 2012 To promote the album, a music video for \\"Unchained\\" was released on February 18, 2013. Directed by Alexandre Spiacci, it was the band's first music video. Antestor played numerous concerts during and after the recording of Omen. On March 5, 2011, the band performed at Elements of Rock in Uster, Switzerland. Though this performance was plagued by very poor sound, the band considered it a success. Throughout 2011 and 2012, Antestor performed at several venues in Norway, Netherlands, and Germany. On January 30, 2013, after Antestor's completion of its Brazilian tour, it announced that its keyboardist, Nickolas Main Henriksen, had left the group due to health reasons, but that no replacement would be recruited. On June 15, 2013, the band performed in Pieks√§m√§ki, Finland. Brazilian tour In January 2013, Antestor embarked on a tour of Brazil to promote the album. Seven venues were scheduled - Jundia√≠, S√£o Paulo, Curitiba, Bel√©m, Vit√≥ria, Belo Horizonte, and Rio de Janeiro. However, the show at Bel√©m was cancelled due to a banking error which led to the band's plane ticket being revoked. While Antestor was playing at Belo Horizonte, the venue was mobbed by Satanist black metal fans who protested against the band members' Christian beliefs. The band had received over three hundred threats, including death threats, since its announcement of the tour in October 2012. At Belo Horizonte, approximately one hundred protestors gathered outside the venue, holding up banners, shouting \\"fuck Antestor!\\", and threatening kill both the band members and concert attendees. About thirty guards stood outside the venue, but the situation escalated and the protestors tried to storm the building. Brodevik, the guitarist, reported that he and his fellow band members were kicked, beaten, and spat upon by protestors. As the protestors tried to tear down the door, the band waited for police to arrive, and then were escorted outside by two officers who were armed and wearing bulletproof vests. The minibus waiting outside the back door had had its tires punctured, so the band was instead escorted out the main entrance. The police fired warning shots and formed a defensive ring, allowing the band to escape in a waiting taxi. After the incident, Brodevik described his and the other band member's situation as \\"trapped like rats.\\" While he said that the band is used to hatred from the extreme metal community toward the Bible and Christianity, nothing like this had ever happened to the band before. Aanonsen, the bassist and a father of three, explained that while he understood that the tour could have ended in death for him and the other band members, when violence finally broke out a Belo Horizonte he remained completely, unexpectedly calm. In retrospect he remarked that while it scared him, the concert in Belo Horizonte was the best he has ever experienced, as all attendees \\"defied so much\\" to get to it. He also noted that because of the attack, the band is now \\"twice as big\\" in Brazil as it had been before the incident. In a summary of the concert posted on Facebook, Antestor stated that Critical reception Released on November 16, 2012, Omen was well received by music critics. They highlighted the drumming on the album, remarking on how B√∏rven was able to match the skill and intensity of Blomberg. Steven Ecott of Cross Rhythms praised the drumming, guitar work, and harsh vocals. He concluded that \\"'Omen' is a breath of fresh air in the rather stale and stuffy room that black metal finds itself resting.\\" Scott Waters of HM wrote that \\"the musicianship is beyond reproach. To simply play that fast and accurate, even for four-minute spurts, requires more than just talent. It requires skill and endurance. Much of the music on Omen display that skill and endurance and definitely accomplishes what it set out to do.\\" Victimer, of Echoes, extolled Antestor's expansive, unorthodox approach. Andy Synn of No Clean Singing, after a lengthy, track-by-track review, concluded that \\"It's clear that Antestor have poured their all into this record, physically and emotionally, learning from their past successes and failures, in order to craft an album of impressive depth and detail, with a volcanic core of molten metal passion.\\" Eric Strother of the website Untombed stated that \\"this band is as strong as ever. Omen is highly recommended not only to (un)black metal fans, but also to anyone with a tolerance for extreme vocals who is a fan of well-crafted, creative metal.\\" However, Strother did note that he personally felt that the bass guitar was buried in the mix, and that this detracted from an otherwise near-perfect album. Musick Magazine's Zuza Stecka opined that the album is sure to satisfy the seven-year wait after Antestor's last release and that the skills in recording the album should not be underestimated. Stecka noted, however, that the guitar solos were not that impressive, and at times sounded as though they were forced, recorded only because the band felt obligated to do so.

The organisation is considered a \\"radical Islamic group\\" and has come under scrutiny from the Australian government.\\"Tony Abbot Wants Taji Out.\\" News.com.au. 2013.\\"The Enemy within.\\" Australian News. They are commonly associated with the goal of all Muslim countries unifying as an Islamic state or caliphate ruled by Islamic law (sharia) and with a head of state (caliph) elected by Muslims. Hizb ut-Tahrir (Australia) has prepared a structure, constitution and an anthem for its proposed Khilafah State. It has more than 300 members in Australia.Hizb ut-Tahrir won‚Äôt condemn Islamic State death cult The Daily Telegraph (Sydney), 19 February 2015 The Hizb ut-Tahrir constitution contains contentious issues such as (Article 7c), \\"Those who are guilty of apostasy (murtadd) from Islam are to be executed\\". The proposed state would enforce Islamic Sharia law. 2005‚Äì2009 In Australia in 2005, the party survived a proposed ban after clearance from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. The party planned its first Khilafah conference in Sydney for 27 January 2007. The planned conference led to allegations in newspaper reports that the party was linked to the July 2005 London bombings.news.com.au Opposition politicians called on the local and federal governments not to grant visas to foreign speakers attending, and to re-consider proscribing Hizb ut-Tahrir. The demands for a ban were rejected by Attorney General Philip Ruddock, on the grounds there was insufficient evidence to warrant banning the group. Radical clerics from the group demanded the establishment of a Muslim superstate, and warned Muslims they must be prepared to kill anyone who threatened its existence. Hizb ut-Tahrir members originally planned to hold the conference in the town hall of Bankstown, New South Wales, a suburb of Sydney with adjacent Lakemba as Australia's biggest Muslim electorate, but the Sydney council cancelled it. Hizb ut-Tahrir secured another location the next day on 28 January. According to the Herald Sun, he also stated, \\"if you people are united and a third person comes along and tries to incite disunity ... kill him..., Muslims are not unique in doing so, as most nations kill those charged with treason....\\"The Herald Sun circa January 2007 Conference spokesman Wassim Doureihi said the work of Hizb ut-Tahrir was not to change the political landscape in Australia. He added, \\"It is because of Islam and my allegiance to Islam that I am responsible for ensuring to do what I can to protect the safety and security of all peoples in this country and beyond.\\" Morris Iemma, Premier of New South Wales and MP for Lakemba, which with adjacent Bankstown has Australia's largest Muslim community, stated around the time of the conference that Hizb ut-Tahrir \\"is an organisation that is basically saying that it desires to declare war on Australia, our values and our people.\\" even though according to Sydney Morning Herald, the speakers at the Khilafah Conference \\"made it clear they did not see Australia as part of their fundamentalist society\\" Attorney General Philip Ruddock responded that the Iemma government should \\"stop playing politics and if it had any evidence helpful to the security agencies, it should give it to them.\\" One opponent of a ban on Hizb ut-Tahrir, Irfan Yusuf, writing in the on-line publication Crikey, stating in No need to be alarmed about Hizb ut-Tahrir that the opposition Australian Labor Party \\"clearly wants to look tougher than the government on national security. But it risks alienating much of its support base in some Muslim circles by picking on a group many Muslims regard as harmless.\\" Ban supporter Rebecca Weisser, however, alleged in The Australian that former members of Hizb ut-Tahrir include Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed Omar Bakri Mohammed \\"four of the seven suspects in the failed terror attacks on London on June 29 and in Glasgow on July 1.\\" In Australia, writer Thomas Lehmann criticized the party and its former media representative, Wassim Doureihi, because they \\"openly flout our hospitality and tolerance while advocating the replacement of our democratic system with theocratic fascism,\\" and for refusing \\"to condemn the September 11, Bali or London terror attacks.\\" 2010‚Äì2014 On 15 September 2012, there were protests outside the American Embassy in Sydney urged on by the website of Hizb ut-Tahrir against non-Muslims. The visiting UK Spokesman for Hizb ut- Tahrir, Taji Mustafa, denied demanding protests and uprisings, although all links on his website leading to Facebook groups substantiate these denials as untrue. The protests preceded an organised gathering at Bankstown on 16 September. Although a video is blamed for the protests, Hizb ut-Tahrir's objectives, led by Taji Mustafa, tend to be for a Caliphate. Placards carried during the protest on 15 September called for beheading, with one such placard being carried by a young child. Taji Mustafa brought further denials that his website has hate speech. There are calls for Hizb ut-Tahrir to be banned in Australia and Taji Mustafa not to re-enter Australia. At a Hizb ut-Tahrir conference held in Sydney in November 2013, speakers called on those present to resist any attempts to moderate Islam, with a Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman condemned any, \\"watering down of Islam\\". The audience was told that a war on Islam is being waged in this country. Reporting on the conference, a commentator noted the paradox in which, \\"Hizb ut-Tahrir [has the] propensity for condemning the government, culture, values and democratic traditions of Australia, while its members seem happy to live here\\". Organisers of a cultural event hosted at the Sydney Opera House, which was part of the Festival of Dangerous Ideas, cancelled a speech by Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman Uthman Badar in June 2014 titled ‚ÄòHonour Killings are Morally Justified‚Äô after widespread outrage.‚ÄòOpera House cancels speech by Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman Uthman Badar on why ‚Äòhonour killings are morally justified‚Äô‚Äô, Daily Telegraph, 25 June 2014. At a demonstration in Sydney held on 25 July 2014, Ismail Al- Wahwah, who is the group's leader in Australia, stated (as translated by MEMRI): At the same rally, Wassim Doureihi described the conflict against Israel as \\"a civilizational struggle between Islam and between kufir,\\" further stating that \\"This is an Islamic struggle to liberate Islamic lands, to re- institute Islamic rule over what is, and will always be, Islamic land.\\" Regarding Jews who currently live in Israel, Doureihi offered the following advice: \\"our advice, very clearly, is to return to the lands from which you immigrated, to do so peacefully before you will do so forcefully.\\" In an audio clip of a speech on Voice of Islam Radio (Australia), which was later posted online 16 October 2014, Ismail Al-Wahwah stated (as translated by MEMRI) that \\"Our true conflict is with Europe and the U.S. They are the enemy. They are the ones that perpetrated crimes against the Islamic nation and its history.\\" He further stated that \\"The Western standard of living is high because they stole our oil and resources, and prevented us from engaging in agriculture, industry, and trade. The famine in our country stems from Western policies.\\"Australian Islamist Leader Ismail Al-Wahwah: Our Number One Enemy Is the U.S. and Europe, MEMRI, Clip No. 4672, (transcript). 10 and 16 October 2014. Sheikh Ismail al-Wahwah (aka Abu Anas) is the spiritual leader of Hizb ut-Tahrir Australia. Uthman Badar and Wassim Doureihi are spokesmen for the organisation. Doureihi has been criticised for failing to denounce the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said, \\"Hizb ut-Tahrir is an organisation with an ideology which justifies terrorism, and that's why I say it's un-Australian, it's also un-Islamic.\\" It has been reported that Man Haron Monis the gunman who took hostages in a siege at the Lindt Chocolate Caf√© in Sydney, was radicalised by members of Hizb ut-Tahrir. In June 2014 Monis attended a presentation by Hizb ut-Tahrir which was held in response to an earlier Hizb ut-Tahrir lecture titled 'Honour Killings are Morally Justified', which was cancelled. 2015 Hizb ut-Tahrir Australia refused to condemn the killing of Charlie Hebdo staff by Islamist militants and organised a Sydney rally, anticipating 10,000 would attend. On the night, some of the 800 attendees carried signs reading, \\"Je suis Muslims\\". Hizb ut- Tahrir speakers denounced freedom of speech and urged supporters not to turn the other cheek if Muhammad is insulted. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Hizb ut-Tahrir are a \\"bit thin-skinned about free speech\\" and need to, \\"lighten up\\"; a Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman subsequently described Abbott's comments as provocative and derogatory. A 2015 article on The Conversation website stated that Hizb ut-Tahrir is not registered as a political party in Australia, and is not active in any mosques or schools. The article said that the organisation \\"does not have any real influence on Australia‚Äôs Islamic community\\". Columnist Janet Albrechtsen says, \\"When Hizb ut-Tahrir exploits our liberties to espouse its freedom-loathing notions . . [we should confront and critique them] . . by exposing their agenda as medieval and immoral\\". In a sermon that was posted on the Internet on 3 March 2015, Australian Hizb ut- Tahrir spokesperson Ismail Al-Wahwah stated (as translated by MEMRI) that \\"Refraining from fighting and from waging Jihad against the Jews constitutes fitna ['strife']. This fitna is worse than killing, because it means that the Israelites will rule the Muslims until Judgment Day\\" while adding that \\"Recognizing the Jews and giving them even a single inch of Palestine constitutes the epitome of evil, because this will strengthen that cancerous entity. They are the most evil creatures of Allah: \\"You shall find the strongest people in enmity towards the believers to the Jews and the polytheists.\\" Later in his sermon, Al-Wahwah stated: Following the sermon the police said, \\"it is not possible to identify who uploaded the footage in question or charge him or her for uploading the offensive material.\\" No charges were laid. During a Hizb ut-Tahrir meeting in Sydney, in May 2015, women were segregated to the rear of the auditorium for \\"cultural reasons\\". In November 2015, at a conference attended by more than 500 people, Hizb ut- Tahrir spokesman Uthman Badar said Muslim children should not be forced to sing the Australian national anthem as the, \\"anthem reflects a particular disputed view of history and celebrates particular ideological values. Why should they be forced to sing it?\\" Attorney-General George Brandis said Australians should be \\"appalled at its lack of respect for the nation‚Äôs cultural identity\\". Australia's Race Discrimination Commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane said Hizb ut-Tahrir's views are, \\"absurd.\\" 2016 In March 2016 the New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal determined that separate male and female seating arrangements at public events hosted by Hizb ut-Tahrir contravened section 33 of the NSW Anti-Discrimination Act. The Tribunal ordered that all future publicity materials for public events hosted by Hizb ut-Tahrir must clearly inform attendees that segregated seating arrangements are not compulsory. 2017 Following the participation of Yassmin Abdel-Magied as a panellist on ABC Q&A; on 13 February 2017 where she started to explain part of her interpretation of Sharia law, Wassim Doureihi commented on his Facebook page about the episode. He said \\"The sister's arguments were indeed problematic, but the bigger problem was to accept to speak within such narrow confines in the first place. Was always set up for failure.\\" A FB profile Yassmina be Chillin (authenticity unverified - not her official FB profile name) responded, saying she was willing to hear feedback and take advice. Doureihi responded that she, \\"ended up framing Islam through a secular lens, aimed at a secular people and conscious of the presence of a secular government\\". In March 2017, at a public forum in Bankstown, Uthman Badar when asked about Article 7c of the Hizb ut-Tahrir constitution, said, \\"Islam is clear that apostates do attract capital punishment, we don't shy away from that.\\" In April 2017 Hizb ut-Tahrir produced a video in which two women discussed how to resolve marital conflicts. One of the women said, \\"a man is permitted to hit a woman as an act of discipline\\" and described the permissive text as \\"beautiful\\" and \\"a blessing\\". There was a strong rejection of the instructions contained in the video, with the Minister for Women Michaelia Cash saying, \\"these attitudes have no place in modern Australia\\". Hizb ut-Tahrir said in response to the criticism, \\"We firmly believe that we, as a community, must not shy away from the clarification of Islamic injunctions\\". Muslim community leaders have rejected the advice in the video saying, \\"Muslim men are required to take the Prophet as their role model and should therefore be active in campaigns and programs to prevent men's violence against women\\". In August 2017 the group's leader Ismail al-Wahwah was banned from entering the kingdom of Denmark and classified as a hate preacher.

The main characters run from Wosret, the highest of high priests, who wants them dead.  Plot  Isikara and her brother Katep lived in the temple of Sobek in Thebes with their father, Henuka. One day, Katep was bitten by a crocodile, reducing his arm to a mutilated stump. Frustrated that he was useless in the temple, he left Egypt. Later, the royal barge of Queen Tiy visited the temple. However, high priest Wosret was sitting on the throne instead of the queen. Apparently, she and her eldest son Tuthmosis died, and Wosret came to request their mummification at the temple. Isikara eavesdropped on the conversation between her father and Wosret. She discovered that Wosret poisoned Tuthmosis so that his younger brother could rule, and that the assassination attempt was unsuccessful. Henuka refused to stab Tuthmosis's heart with a needle to ensure his death. Isikara accidentally knocked over one of Queen Tiy's canopic jars, causing Wosret to discover her eavesdropping. With discreet assistance from her father, Isikara escaped with Tuthmosis through a secret passageway. The two used a senet board to navigate the tunnel, which led them through Tuthmosis's father's burial chamber and to the tomb's exit. Tuthmosis sought the help of a Nubian girl named Ta Miu, who provided them with supplies. Isakara and Tuthmosis disguised themselves as peasants, repeatedly avoiding detection by Wosret while escaping to the desert. While in the desert, they were captured by Medjay nomads, who brought them to their camp at an oasis. There, Isikara and Tuthmosis met a rebellious girl named Anoukhet, who had a plan for them to escape together with an old camel tender. The escape did not go as planned, resulting in Isikara attacking and accidentally killing the nomads' leader, Naqada, before escaping. The group arrived at Syene, where the camel tender departed from the others. Anoukhet secured the remaining trio a delivery job, and they journeyed south. As the three approached Nubia, Tuthmosis planned to ally with the Kushites by promising peace from Egypt if they helped him regain his throne. They encountered the Kushite army and saw Katep, who had been promoted to phalanx leader for saving the former commander from drowning. The army accepted the girls due to Anoukhet's archery skills, and Isikara became a fletcher. One day, the Egyptian army approached. When the Kushite soldiers went to battle, Isikara followed but failed to catch up. She was captured by Egyptian soldiers and used as a human shield by one of their charioteers. Anoukhet saved her from being struck by her own arrows by shooting her captor. However, the two were captured again while trying to escape the fray. The Egyptian army cut off Anoukhet's bow fingers. Isikara protested, resulting in her fingers being cut off as well. While the Egyptian army celebrated, believing the Kushites had surrendered, Tuthmosis appeared and told the Egyptians his story. The Egyptian commander was unsympathetic and called the prince a traitor for hiding among the Kushites. In response, Katep shot at the commander's feet. Tuthmosis revealed that each of the Egyptian soldiers has an arrow aimed at him. The commander was shot in the heart, and the Kushites were victorious soon after. Anoukhet was furious Tuthmosis did not attempt to regain his territory. Tuthmosis replied that he did not want his country to be ruled by fear or bloodshed. He planned to return to Thebes soon.

It was built in 1941. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Grandchester sawmill steam engine, 1945 The Gillam brothers started the Grandchester Sawmills in 1941. While at this time World War II brought a severe reduction in housing activity, after a short resurgence when the depression lifted, the declaration of war with Japan at the end of 1941 was followed by a huge upsurge of construction for military purposes. As structures were needed quickly and were expected to be temporary, the demand for milled timber grew rapidly. One of Queensland's earliest major industrial enterprises was William Pettigrew's sawmill in Brisbane. Opening in 1853, the sawmill predated the separation of Queensland as a colony by six years. Within two decades sawmills were commonplace and were an important investment in the regional economy. The Grandchester sawmill is powered by steam and this factor makes it an unusual phenomenon in Queensland and Australia. The steam engine was built by \\"Marshall Sons & Co. Ltd, Engineers, Gainsborough, England.\\" The date of construction is unclear, however a small plate records a machinery inspection in 1911. The steam engine was first used in the Nestle's factory in Toogoolawah (since demolished). It was then used in the Lowood butter factory and afterwards in the Hoods Sawmill, Gatton. Initially, two traction engines were used for boilers but the brothers acquired the boiler of a No. 922 Ipswich based railway steam engine, built by Walkers Limited, Maryborough in 1966. The boiler is fuelled by sawdust from the circular saws and is a cheap and efficient method of power. The mill is still operating, being a small family operation cutting mainly crating timber. On 6 May 2007, the mill was damaged by fire. However, it is still operational and is being restored.  Description  Machine shed, 2015 Grandchester Sawmills is located on the southern side of Symes Street in the town of Grandchester. The sawmill is set back from the road on a sloping piece of land which backs onto the Main Line railway. Grandchester railway station is visible from the rear of the sawmill. The sawmill machinery is housed in a gabled structure with mono-pitched roof extension at one end under which the locomotive boiler sits minus its undercarriage. The sawn timber roof structure is supported on round timber posts. It is not enclosed by any walls. The mill is powered by a locomotive boiler from Walkers - built C17 No.922 and a steam engine. The boiler has a name plate attached to one side reading \\"Old Reliable\\". The sawmill is driven by a belt and pulley system. All saws, except for one small electric saw, are powered by the steam engine. A small pyramidal silo stands to the rear of the main sawmill structure which is used to store the sawdust for the boiler. Three other structures stand on the property. A timber house to the north-west of the mill, a small timber building directly in front (north) of the mill bearing evidence it was once a petrol station and another small timber structure to north-east of the sawmill.  Heritage listing  Grandchester Sawmills was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The timber industry has been a significant part of Queensland's history as timber getters were among the first Europeans to live and work in the colony. Grandchester Sawmills demonstrates the evolution of the timber in Queensland. The small sawmill was opened in 1941 at a time when the Second World War demanded increased production of sawn timber in Queensland. The continued success of the business is attributed to it responding to the changing demands for sawn timber in Queensland. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Grandchester Sawmills is one of the few remaining steam powered sawmills left in Queensland, if not Australia, still in commercial use. The machinery used to power the sawmill is uncommon and of high technological interest. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The saw mill has a long association with the Gillam family and their employees being owned and run by them since 1941 to the present day.

She approached Rajeswari Tejaswi, Poornachandra Tejaswi's wife, for the copyrights to adapt the novella into a film. Following this, she announced of the film in January 2015. Casting Kittur announced that the lead role of Daanamma would be played by Shwetha Srivatsav, and that Achyuth Kumar would appear in a pivotal role. It was revealed in March 2015 that Sukrutha Wagle, Sonu, Kishore and Manasa Joshi would play other lead. Sharath Lohitashwa would play supporting roles, and that Yogesh would appear in an important role in the film. On casting Srivatsav in the lead role, she said, \\"She has not been exposed to too many films. So, I thought that she would appear fresh in this particular role. Also, she had already read the novel, when I approached her and all she asked me was whether she would be playing the character of Daanamma\\". The casting of Karunya Ram and Manasa Joshi were confirmed in April 2015. Writer Agni Shridhar, who had previously collaborated with Kittur in Edegarike (2012), was chosen to work on the film's screenplay and dialogues. Speaking on the subject of the film, Kittur said the film was \\"heroine- oriented\\" and that it would \\"depict the lives of girls in villages.\\" Speaking to The Indian Express during its post-production stages, Shridhar said, \\"[T]he film is a mirror of the women folk of any village in India but does not talk about feminism, neither in the story nor through the characters. But the feminist theme Sumana has portrayed would be the answer to the people in all fields, including politics\\". Filming Pre-production work of the film began in April 2015. Reports said, prior to the beginning of filming, in preparation for her role, Srivatsav took to villages in Karnataka to get a hold of the village dialect and understand the way of living. To resemble the village with environs of Kiragooru as depicted by Tejaswi in his novella, the makers scouted over 50 villages in areas surrounding and in Bangalore and Mysore in Karnataka before zeroing on three villages in Kanakapura of Ramanagara district ‚Äî Doddabadkere, Goluru and Chikkanawalase ‚Äî villages close to Bangalore, making the team easier to traverse between them and the latter.

Anderson tied for second place in the 1888 Open Championship with Ben Sayers. He also tied for 6th in the 1895 Open Championship. Early life Anderson was born in St Andrews, Scotland, on 29 November 1867. He worked for his father David Anderson Sr., founder of D. Anderson & Sons with his four brothers. His grandfather was David \\"Da\\" Anderson, greenskeeper at the Old Course at St Andrews, and he was the nephew of Jamie Anderson, three-time Open champion. David Anderson Jr. went on to manage the Tommy Morris golf shop as did his son and grandson. Golf career 1888 Open Championship The 1888 Open Championship was the 28th Open Championship, held 6 October at the Old Course at St Andrews, Fife, Scotland. Jack Burns won the Championship by a stroke from David Anderson Jr. and Ben Sayers. =Details of play= Willie Campbell was in good form‚Äîworking his way around in 84‚Äîand was the leader after 18 holes for the third consecutive year. Sayers was one shot further back on 85 and four players were bunched on 86. In the afternoon Sayers, in the first group, scored 87 and took an early lead on 172. Campbell ran into difficulties on a few holes making a number of mistakes and scored 90 for a total of 174. Sayers was then joined on 172 by David Anderson. Playing a few groups behind, Burns carded an 85 and took the lead on 171, a score none of the later players could match. Burns's score for his first round had originally been added up to 87 but an R&A; member noticed that it was added up incorrectly and the total was adjusted to 86, making Burns the champion.

It was released under Strayhorn's name (and Hodges was only listed under the pseudonym \\"Cue Porter\\") because Hodges was contractually prohibited from releasing albums on other record labels: \\"Since Hodges was under contract with Norman Granz to record exclusively for Verve Records, Dance found himself prohibited from releasing the album under Hodge's name. As an out, he titled it Cue for Saxophone, a hint at the featured player's identity, and issued the record in the name of Billy Strayhorn's Septet. 'Billy didn't care,' said Dance. Indeed, as [drummer Oliver] Jackson explained, Strayhorn seemed to exert a minimum of creative effort on the project. 'He showed up late, and he didn't have anything planned....He knocked off whatever arrangements we used off the top of his head. He didn't seem to give much of a damn, and the thing had his name on it....I said, 'Hey Strays, isn't this something, man? All those things you did for Duke, and all the people think Duke did 'em? And here there's finally a record with your own name on it, and it's really Rabs!'\\" For the same reason, a 1958 recording of the Duke Ellington Orchestra live at the Blue Note club in Chicago was originally released on Roulette Records under Strayhorn's name as Billy Strayhorn Live!!!\\"David Hajdu, Lush Life: A Biography of Billy Strayhorn, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1996, page 198.

Chaotic cryptography is the application of the mathematical chaos theory to the practice of the cryptography, the study or techniques used to privately and securely transmit information with the presence of a third-party or adversary. Since first being investigated by Robert Matthews in 1989,\\"On the derivation of a ‚Äúchaotic‚Äù encryption algorithm.\\" Matthews, R.A.J. Cryptologia 13, no. 1 (1989): 29-42. the use of chaos in cryptography has attracted much interest; however, long-standing concerns about its security and implementation speed continue to limit its implementation.\\"Supercomputer investigations of a chaotic encryption algorithm\\" DD Wheeler, RAJ Matthews Cryptologia 15 (2), 140-152 In order to use chaos theory efficiently in cryptography, the chaotic maps should be implemented such that the entropy generated by the map can produce required Confusion and diffusion. Properties in chaotic systems and cryptographic primitives share unique characteristics that allow for the chaotic systems to be applied to cryptography. If chaotic parameters, as well as cryptographic keys, can be mapped symmetrically or mapped to produce acceptable and functional outputs, it will make it next to impossible for an adversary to find the outputs without any knowledge of the initial values. Since chaotic maps in a real life scenario require a set of numbers that are limited, they may, in fact, have no real purpose in a cryptosystem if the chaotic behavior can be predicted. One of the most important issues for any cryptographic primitive is the security of the system. However, in numerous cases, chaos- based cryptography algorithms are proved unsecure. The main issue in many of the cryptanalyzed algorithms is the inadequacy of the chaotic maps implemented in the system.  Types of chaos cryptography  The concept of chaos cryptography or in the other words chaos-based cryptography can be divided into two major groups: the asymmetric and symmetric chaos-based cryptography. The majority of the symmetric chaos-based algorithms are based on the application of discrete chaotic maps in their process.  Chaos-based image encryption  Bourbakis and Alexopoulos in 1991 proposed supposedly the earliest fully intended digital image encryption scheme which was based on SCAN language. Later on, with the emergence of chaos-based cryptography hundreds of new image encryption algorithms, all with the aim of improving the security of digital images were proposed. However, there were three main aspects of the design of an image encryption that was usually modified in different algorithms (chaotic map, application of the map and structure of algorithm). The initial and perhaps most crucial point was the chaotic map applied in the design of the algorithms. The speed of the cryptosystem is always an important parameter in the evaluation of the efficiency of a cryptography algorithm, therefore, the designers were initially interested in using simple chaotic maps such as tent map, and the logistic map. However, in 2006 and 2007, the new image encryption algorithms based on more sophisticated chaotic maps proved that application of chaotic map with higher dimension could improve the quality and security of the cryptosystems.  Chaos-based hash function   Chaos-based random number generation  The unpredictable behavior of the chaotic maps can be used in the generation of random numbers. Some of the earliest chaos-based random number generators tried to directly generate random numbers from the logistic map.

Like Petra, it is a Nabataean site, with buildings carved into the walls of the sandstone canyons. As its name suggests, it is much smaller, consisting of three wider open areas connected by a canyon. It is part of the Petra Archeological Park, though accessed separately, and included in Petra's inscription as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is often visited by tourists in conjunction with Petra itself, since it is free and usually less crowded. Like Petra, it was probably built during the height of Nabataean influence during the 1st century C.E. While the purpose of some of the buildings is not clear, archaeologists believe that the whole complex was a suburb of Petra, the Nabatean capital, meant to house visiting traders on the Silk Road. After the decline of the Nabataeans, it fell vacant, used only by Bedouin nomads, for centuries. Along with neighboring Beidha, Little Petra was excavated in the later 20th century by Diana Kirkbride and Brian Byrd. In 2010, a biclinium, or dining room, in one of the caves was discovered to have surviving interior art depicting grapes, vines and putti in great detail with a varied palette, probably in homage to the Greek god Dionysus and the consumption of wine. The 2,000-year- old ceiling frescoes in the Hellenistic style have since been restored. While they are not only the only known example of interior Nabataean figurative painting in situ, they are a very rare large-scale example of Hellenistic painting, considered superior even to similar later Roman paintings at Herculaneum Geography Little Petra is in an arid, mountainous desert region above sea level. To the east the Arabian Desert opens up. On the west the rugged terrain soon descends into the Jordan Rift Valley, with lands around the Dead Sea as low as below sea level. It is on the local road that leaves Wadi Musa and follows the edge of the mountains around Petra itself through the small Bedouin village of Umm Sayhoun. About north of Wadi Musa, a short road to the west leads to the small, unpaved parking lot for Little Petra and Beidha, a Neolithic site nearby. There is another small Bedouin settlement 1 km (0.6 mi) to the east. alt=A narrow canyon with high, beige rounded stone walls and a dusty floor. A man can be seen walking in the distance From the parking lot Siq al-Barid opens up in the rock facade to the west southwest. Its name, literally \\"cold canyon\\", comes from its orientation and its high walls preventing the entry of most available sunlight. The modern name \\"Little Petra\\" comes from its similarities to the larger site to the south‚Äîboth must be entered via a narrow canyon, and consist primarily of Nabataean buildings. The canyon widens after . In this open area many of the sandstone walls have had openings carved into them; they were used as dwellings. On the south face is a colonnaded triclinium with a projecting pedimented portico that archaeologists believe was used as a temple, though they know very little about it. The canyon then narrows again for another 50 m (150 ft), leading to another, smaller open area. The carved openings are even more numerous here, including four large triclinia. Archaeologists believe these spaces could have been used to entertain visiting merchants. On the south side is a small biclinium. It has some rare surviving Nabataean paintings on its rear wall, and so it is called the Painted Room. Opposite the room on the north is a large cistern, part of the water system built by the original inhabitants. At the west end of the canyon a set of steps leads to the top of the rock. There are panoramic views available of the entire Petra region. A lightly-used foot trail leads from there to Ad-Deir at Petra, to the southwest. History Archaeologists believe that Little Petra was established in the 1st century C.E., when the Nabataean culture was at its peak in the region. It was probably a suburb of the larger city to the south, perhaps where its more successful merchants lived, and entertained their visiting counterparts. The location may have been chosen because of the nearby older settlement of Beidha, inhabited since the earlier Neolithic era. Since investigations of the site have generally focused on the Nabataean and earlier periods, it is not known whether it was still inhabited around the same time Petra itself was ultimately abandoned, in the 7th century. For the remainder of the millennium, and much of the next, Little Petra remained unknown to all but the Bedouin nomads who sometimes camped in it or its vicinity. Europeans, who could not visit the Arab world under Islamic rule, heard about Petra but were unsure of its existence. When Swiss traveler Jacob Burckhardt became the first Western visitor to Petra since Roman times in 1812, he did not venture to its north, or did not write about it. Later Western visitors to the region likewise seem to have concentrated on the main Petra site. Only in the late 1950s did British archaeologist Diana Kirkbride supplement her excavations at Petra itself with digs in the Beidha area, which included Little Petra, not described as a separate site at the time. Those digs continued until 1983,Comer, Environmental History, 105 two years before UNESCO inscribed the Petra area, including Beidha and Little Petra, as a World Heritage Site. Following that designation, tourism to Petra increased, and spiked upwards again following the 1989 release of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, which climaxed with the main characters riding down Petra's Siq to Al-Khazneh, where they found the Holy Grail.Comer, Environmental History, 5 To assure that this growth benefited the region and did not degrade its archaeological resources, the Petra Regional Authority was created to manage all the resources within a area. Beidha and Little Petra, among other satellite sites, were included in the Petra Archaeological Park. The village of Umm Sayhoun was built between Wadi Musa and the two sites to house the Bedouin. Painted Biclinium The Painted Biclinium Located along the main avenue in Little Petra (Siq al- Barid), the Painted Biclinium is a rock-cut biclinium, or dining room, with well preserved wall paintings. In addition to offering the most abundant variety of figural painting from the Nabataean period, the frescoes of the Painted Biclinium may offer clues into the vegetation under cultivation in the area around Siq al-Barid. In addition, the paintings are proof of the importance of Dionysiac religious cult in Nabataea. = Location = Little Petra (Siq al-Barid) is a narrow wadi located some 8 kilometers north of the Petra city center. The wadi is a rich archaeological site, featuring rock cut tombs, stone-built architecture, and complex hydrological engineering. The site is located in the fertile northern hinterlands of Petra, a landscape that preserves evidence of large-scale viticulture and wine making, alongside the cultivation of grains, olives, and other produce. The Painted Biclinium is located on the south side of the Siq al-Barid. Surrounding the Painted Biclinium are a series of tombs and banqueting halls cut into the natural sandstone of the wadi, alongside the foundations of freestanding structures, cisterns, and water channels. = Discovery and fieldwork = The building and its frescoes were first photographed in the early 20th century by P√®re Abel (1906), and smoke damage and Arabic graffiti on the walls of the building demonstrate that the Painted Biclinium was continually occupied by local Bedouins. Studies of the frescoes relied almost exclusively on these early photographs, focusing on the visible iconography of the scenes and identifying the figures of Eros and Pan. When Nelson Glueck visited Little Petra, he did not see the frescoes at the Painted Biclinium for himself \\"because of the hordes of fleas which infested it\\". From 2006‚Äì2010, the Petra National Trustt and the Courtauld Institute of Art in London carried out an extensive conservation project in the Painted Biclinium, which revealed new imagery on the monument and made clear the vibrancy of the color and style of the artwork. Most recently, samples of plaster and mortar were subjected to radiocarbon dating by Yarmouk University in Jordan, providing a calibrated date of 40 BCE‚Äì25 CE for the wall paintings. = Architecture = The Painted Biclinium comprises rock-cut stairs leading up from the floor of the Siq al-Barid, terminating at a platform hewn from the wall of the narrow wadi. The platform stands before the main entrance to the Biclinium, which leads to two chambers, one of which leads into the other. The first chamber is larger than the second, and is rectangular in shape with two benches carved out of the rock on either side of the door. The smaller, interior chamber is vaulted, and has a higher floor level than the first room. The monument parallels other feasting structures from both Little Petra and its environs, some of which are directly associated with nearby tombs and the veneration of ancestor cult, while other examples are not associated with tombs and are instead interpreted as spaces for religious feasting. = Frescoes = The wall paintings in the Painted Biclinium can be grouped into two major scenes. The larger chamber has its south wall decorated with stucco, creating faux architectural elements reminiscent of some Pompeian wall painting. Fresco from the Painted Biclinium The inner room has painted decoration in a completely different style than the larger outer room. Instead of architectural embellishment, the walls and vaulted ceiling of this room exhibit a complex program of intertwining vines, flowers, figures, several varieties of local birds, and insects. Several erotes‚Äîsmall winged gods associated with love and occasionally the cultivation of wine‚Äîare seen participating in viticulture management, using ladders and pruning hooks, carrying baskets of gathered grapes, and defending the vines from scavenging birds. The erotes are armed with bows, arrows, and spears. In addition to the domesticated and harvested grape vines, wild raspberry vines and field bindweed flowers wrap throughout the scene to pay homage to the local flora of Petra's northern hinterland. Twaissi et al. (2010) were able to identify an additional anthropomorphic figure in the scene in addition to the erotes, who they interpret as a representation of the Romanized Egyptian goddess Isis. However, the overall iconographic scene and architectural parallels elsewhere in the area of Petra lend weight to the attribution of the space as a center of Dionysiac worship. In addition to the figural and floral painting within the inner room of the Painted Biclinium, the room appears to have been further embellished with an intricate program of stuccoed decoration. Remnants of an entablature are preserved on the east and west walls of the room, and the center of the vault once held a stucco medallion. = Significance = The significance of these paintings lies in their figurative elements, a subject that is often absent in preserved Nabataean painting and other media. While a small fragment of a human face was found during the excavations of the Great Temple and the excavation of the Temple of the Winged Lions brought to light other select fragments, the frescoes at the Painted Biclinium form both the most complete painted scene in the Nabataean archaeological record and the only one remaining in situ. The features of the figural composition, including the large eyes and round chins, have parallels with other pieces of Hellenistic painting and mosaic, while the floral and faunal subjects are distinctly local. In addition, while the archaeological record pointing to Dionysiac worship appears prolific among the Nabataean elite, few contexts preserve any record of this practice outside of architecture and pottery. The Painted Biclinium, then, serves to provide a colorful flourish to our understanding of this religious tradition in the cultivated rich semi-arid landscape around Petra. Access Like Petra, Little Petra is open to the public during the daytime. It is, however, operated separately, and does not require an admission ticket and fee as Petra does. The local Bedouins sell souvenirs and snacks in the small parking lot, which also serves Beidha. Bedouin herders sometimes take their stock into the site to water at the cisterns. Many visitors to Petra have increasingly been including Little Petra on their itineraries. Guidebooks recommend it as less crowded and more relaxed than Petra itself. The Painted House, which has no counterpart at Petra, has also added to the attraction. It is also possible to hike via the trail from the end of the canyon to Ad-Deyr at Petra. Those who make the journey are advised to do so with a guide as the trail, while obvious in many places, is not formally marked. Hikers are also cautioned against attempting the trail alone, or late in the day, as nights in the region are often cold. It is also forbidden to enter Petra without having paid the larger site's admission.

As part of the technique, the squid spend very little time submerged in the water and more of it suspended in the air above‚Äî in this way it resembles kite fishing. It is named for the green tint of the extremely long fiberglass poles originally made in Japan specifically for this purpose (though more recent poles may be made from other materials and be of any color). The poles come in sections of , and are hollow and tapered so that they can be nested inside one another. The assembled pole is normally between and long. The main line of a green-sticking fishing pole typically runs over and will be made of 800- to 1000-pound monofilament fishing line. Between five and seven squid lures are then attached to this line between and apart. The lengths of these leader lines vary depending on the length of the pole so that as the angle of the main line \\"details\\" more to the water, the lures will tend to skip across its surface rather than sink beneath it. Finally, at the end of the main line is attached an artificial \\"bird\\" which drags about behind the watercraft. This bird, which is about long and weighs about , is painted to resemble a small cetacean. It moves below the waterline and holds the line taught so that the lures can effectively skip over the water ahead of it. Fishermen believe that the bird creates a visual signal to passing tuna that potential food lies ahead and that they should outrun the \\"bird\\" in order to get it first. The fishing technique is unusual for two reasons. First, it relies on fishing lures which seldom enter the water, depending instead on the ability of the tuna to see what is happening in the air above the water's surface and even to select prey targets above the surface which do not normally travel there. Second, it uses the theory of competition for prey to incite the tuna to pursue the lures in an \\"I'm going to get it before you do\\" approach to hunting.

Early life Demchak has a Bachelor of Science from Allegheny College and an MBA (with an emphasis in accounting) from the University of Michigan. At Allegheny, he was an Alden Scholar, actively participating in student government, the economics club, the Interfraternity Council, intramural sports, and Lacrosse. In addition, he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity as well as the Phi Beta Kappa Honor Society. Career Before PNC, Demchak held a variety of key executive positions at JP Morgan Chase. This includes: Global Head of Structured Finance and Credit Portfolio, involved in strategic agenda (before the JP Morgan-Chase Manhattan merger), member of the board of directors. He says JPMorgan Chase ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt a terribly enjoyable place to work.‚Äù He was also a director of Hilliard Lyons Research Advisors. In 2002, Demchak first joined PNC as chief financial officer. At that time he worked alongside the then CEO, Jim Rohr. Three years later, he was promoted to head of the company‚Äôs Corporate & Institutional Banking, in charge of PNC's middle market and large corporate businesses, capital markets, real estate finance, equity management and leasing. In 2009, Demchak became Senior Vice Chairman and shortly there after head of PNC Businesses. William S. Demchak was elected president in April 2012, then chief executive officer in April 2013 and finally chairman in April 2014. In this capacity he is responsible for all of PNC‚Äôs businesses, including corporate and institutional banking, retail banking, mortgage banking and the Asset Management Group. His total calculated compensation for the 2014 fiscal year was $11,337,904. In 2009, Financial Times reporter Gillian Tett named Demchak as head of the team at JP Morgan whose financial innovations later played a role in the 2008 crash. Tett described how the team developed new securitization techniques for \\"turbocharging the market\\". In particular, the team realised that SPV (special purpose vehicles) would not have to be fully funded. When the concept was taken up by less cautious banks, it would create \\"consequences that are currently rocking the planet.\\" Personal life Demchak was born and raised and still today, lives in Pittsburgh. He says there is \\"nowhere else I‚Äôd want to raise my family.\\" He is married to Debbie and they have three children together. He formerly sat on the Regulatory Management Committee of The Financial Services Roundtable, the Supervisory Board of The Clearing House, the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, Extra Mile Education Foundation, Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, the World Affairs Council of Pittsburgh, YMCA of Pittsburgh and the Greater Pittsburgh Council of the Boy Scouts of America, the latter of which he in the past, held the role of chairman. Philosophy According to Demchak, one key ingredient to becoming a successful leader is to believe you can always be better. He advises potential leaders to: ‚Äúlearn from your failures, surround yourself with people who will challenge you. Ensure your vision is shared ‚Äòclearly and often‚Äô with your team. Remain grounded in your values so that you never forget who you serve or why you come to work.‚Äù Of this specific work he has done and continues to do at PNC he says: ‚ÄúUnlike every bank in our position in history we‚Äôre not going to jump into capital markets.‚Äù References Category:Living people Category:1963 births Category:21st-century American businesspeople Category:Ross School of Business alumni ","title":"William S.

Each receptor type is expressed within a subset of neurons, from which they directly connect to the olfactory bulb in the brain.Young, J. M., & Trask, B. J. (2002). The sense of smell: genomics of vertebrate odorant receptors. Human molecular genetics, 11(10), 1153-1160. Olfaction is essential for survival in most vertebrates; however, the degree to which an animal depends on smell is highly varied. Great variation exists in the number of OR genes among vertebrate species, as shown through bioinformatic analyses. This diversity exists by virtue of the wide- ranging environments that they inhabit. For instance, dolphins that are secondarily adapted to an aquatic niche possess a considerably smaller subset of genes than most mammals.Niimura, Y. (2012). Olfactory receptor multigene family in vertebrates: from the viewpoint of evolutionary genomics. Current genomics, 13(2), 103. OR gene repertoires have also evolved in relation to other senses, as higher primates with well-developed vision systems tend to have a smaller number of OR genes. As such, investigating the evolutionary changes of OR genes can provide useful information on how genomes respond to environmental changes. Differences in smell sensitivity are also dependent on the anatomy of the olfactory apparatus, such as the size of the olfactory bulb and epithelium. Nonetheless, the general features of the olfactory system are highly conserved among vertebrates,Eisthen, H. L. (1997). Evolution of vertebrate olfactory systems. Brain, behavior and evolution, 50(4), 222-233. and, similarly to other sensory systems, olfaction has undergone fairly modest changes throughout the evolution of vertebrates. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that at least three distinct olfactory subsystems are broadly consistent in vertebrates, and a fourth accessory system (vomeronasal) solely arose in tetrapods. Molecular Evolution Mutations affecting OR genes on the chromosome are primarily responsible for the evolution of smell. OR genes are grouped in clusters along multiple chromosomes and are responsible for coding respective OR proteins. These proteins contain seven transmembrane domains that are responsible for detecting specific sets of odor molecules.Nei, M., Niimura, Y., & Nozawa, M. (2008). The evolution of animal chemosensory receptor gene repertoires: roles of chance and necessity. Nature Reviews Genetics, 9(12), 951-963. OR genes are located on error-prone regions of the chromosome, and consequently, the DNA of the OR gene is periodically duplicated during crossover. After this duplication event, one of the two genes may mutate and disable its function, rendering it as a pseudogene. Alternatively, the duplicated copy may mutate without dysfunctionality, and will continue making the same olfactory receptor but with altered structural changes. This protein adjustment can induce a subtle shift in the range of smells an animal can sense. The diversity of smelling genes present in humans today are attributed to multiple rounds of mutations that have occurred throughout vertebrate evolution. In particular, repeated rounds of gene duplication, deletion, and pseudogene evolution contribute to the variety of OR gene number. Formally known as ‚Äúbirth-and-death evolution‚Äù, these dynamics are measured by the number of gains and losses from genes in each branch of the phylogenetic tree in question. Statistical methods can be used to estimate the total number of gains and losses, which can be as large as several hundred per branch of the tree.Nozawa, M., & Nei, M. (2007). Evolutionary dynamics of olfactory receptor genes in Drosophila species. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104(17), 7122-7127. Moreover, the number of gains and losses can be enormous even if two extant species possess the same gene number (for example, humans and macaques). Both adaptation and random events can cause birth-and-death evolution. The probability of gene duplication is dictated by chance events and primarily occurs through unequal crossover; this excludes the rare event of whole genome duplication. Alternatively, the Fixation of duplicate genes can be influenced by natural selection or can occur randomly.Nozawa M, Kawahara Y, Nei M. 2007. Genomic drift and copy number variation of sensory receptor genes in humans. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 104:20421‚Äì20426 Within the mammalian phylogenetic tree, a large number of gene gains and losses are observed for almost all branches, suggesting that a significant fraction of gene number changes were caused by inactivation events and random gene duplication. This process is known as genomic drift, or ‚Äúrandom genetic drift of gene frequencies‚Äù in population genetics. Pseudogenes are also subject to genomic drift, since they are rendered as non-functional and are believed to evolve in a neutral manner.Li, W. H., Gojobori, T., & Nei, M. (1981). Pseudogenes as a paradigm of neutral evolution. Nature, 292(5820), 237-239. Lineage At least nine groups of vertebrate OR genes have been identified (Œ±,Œ≤,Œ≥,Œ¥,Œµ,Œ∂,Œ∑, and Œ∏), each of which derived from ancestral genes in the most common ancestor of tetrapods and fish. Specifically, vertebrate OR genes convey an evolutionary pattern of three separate lineages: fish, amphibians, and mammals.Niimura Y, Nei M. 2005b. Evolutionary dynamics of olfactory receptor genes in fishes and tetrapods. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 102:6039‚Äì6044. Early Vertebrates and Fish Genetics Vertebrate olfaction was first derived in an aquatic ecosystem, where water was the primary medium for odorants. Lancelets, a class of fish-like marine chordates, are the most distantly related ancestors that share the same olfactory receptors (OR) with humans. They diverged from our own ancestors approximately 700 million years ago, shortly before the development of the eyes and brain. Although they lack an identifiable olfactory organ, lancelets possess 40 olfactory receptor genes that are studded along their flanks to detect odor molecules from their surrounding aquatic environment. Furthermore, many vertebrate-type olfactory receptor genes were found in their genome. Serving as living descendants that thrived almost half a billion years ago, the study of OR genes in lampreys also provides deep insight into the origins of vertebrate olfaction.Freitag, J., Krieger, J., Strotmann, J., & Breer, H. (1995). Two classes of olfactory receptors in Xenopus laevis. Neuron, 15(6), 1383-1392. Structural motifs that are characteristic hallmarks of vertebrate ORs were discerned when isolating OR genes expressed in lamprey olfactory organs. Phylogenetic analysis comparing the OR genes of fish and mammals revealed that lamprey ORs diverged from higher vertebrates before the origin of Class I and II genes. It was also found that the lamprey OR gene repertoire was relatively small. Gene duplication and genetic drift expanded these small repertoires in gene number over evolutionary time, supporting the notion that the lamprey OR sequence represents an ancient OR family.Mezler, M. A. R. I. O., Konzelmann, S. I. D. O. N. I. E., Freitag, J. O. A. C. H. I. M., Rossler, P., & Breer, H. E. I. N. Z. (1999). Expression of olfactory receptors during development in Xenopus laevis. The Journal of Experimental Biology, 202(4), 365-376. The vast diversity of olfactory organs is largely attributed to the long evolutionary lifespan of fish.Hara, T. J. (1975). Olfaction in fish. Progress in Neurobiology, 5, 271-335. Representing an evolutionarily older class of vertebrates, fish carry several ancestral OR genes on their chromosome, yet they express wide variation in these genes among individuals and species.Shi, P., & Zhang, J. (2009). Extraordinary diversity of chemosensory receptor gene repertoires among vertebrates. In Chemosensory Systems in Mammals, Fishes, and Insects (pp. 57-75). Springer Berlin Heidelberg. Fish have reduced olfactory systems in comparison to mammals since they only contain approximately 100 OR, whereas most mammals can possess 500 to 1000. New phylogenomic analysis shows urochordates, rather than cephalochordates, as the sister group to vertebrates.Delsuc, F., Brinkmann, H., Chourrout, D., & Philippe, H. (2006). Tunicates and not cephalochordates are the closest living relatives of vertebrates. Nature, 439(7079), 965-968.Putnam, N. H., Butts, T., Ferrier, D. E., Furlong, R. F., Hellsten, U., Kawashima, T., ... & Rokhsar, D. S. (2008). The amphioxus genome and the evolution of the chordate karyotype. Nature, 453(7198), 1064-1071. All OR genes were lost in the lineage of urochordata because of the absence of any vertebrate-type OR-like genes. The loss of vertebrate type OR-genes therefore suggests that they may have been lost in the urochordates genomes (lost genes conserved between amphioxus and vertebrates).Holland, L. Z., Albalat, R., Azumi, K., Benito-Guti√©rrez, √à., Blow, M. J., Bronner-Fraser, M., ... & Vopalensky, P. (2008). The amphioxus genome illuminates vertebrate origins and cephalochordate biology. Genome research, 18(7), 1100-1111. Class I and Class II Phylogenetic analysis has delineated two main types of olfactory receptor genes that are traced back to early vertebrate OR history: class I genes, responsible for encoding proteins that detect water-soluble odorants, and Class II genes, associated with the detection of airborne molecules. Both types serve as homologous structures in fish and tetrapods.Mezler, M., Fleischer, J., & Breer, H. (2001). Characteristic features and ligand specificity of the two olfactory receptor classes from Xenopus laevis. Journal of Experimental Biology, 204(17), 2987-2997. In Xenopus laevis, an amphibia, both class receptors are present, unlike fish or mammals. Their class I receptors are expressed on the lateral diverticulum (LD), a region specialized to respond to water-soluble odorants, and class II receptors are abundantly present in the medial diverticulum (MD) which is specialized at detecting volatile odors. Structure All fish perceive odors though nostril-like structures called nares. Most fish lack vomeronasal structures, yet they are still able to detect pheromones through vomeronasal-related genes. In lieu of the organ, fish possess sensory epithelium that contains three types of sensory cells, two of which are responsible for sex pheromones and social cures.D√∏ving, K. B. (2002). The alarm reaction in crucian carp is mediated by olfactory neurons with long dendrites. Chemical senses, 27(4), 395-398. Considering the slow diffusion of odor molecules through water, it is evolutionarily reasonable to possess only one type of cell dedicated to odorants and two cells dedicated to chemical communication.Hoover, K. C. (2010). Smell with inspiration: the evolutionary significance of olfaction. American journal of physical anthropology, 143(S51), 63-74. Selection Fish primarily use pheromones to facilitate social behavior, such as social and reproductive cues and predator avoidance. Antipredation pheromones vary across species; some may emit chemical cues that provoke physiological changes (e.g. body depth increase), or cues that promote evasion (release of odor cues of dead conspecifics). Pheromone detection is also highly used in kin identification, survival-enhancing aggregation (e.g. shoaling), and migratory signalling. Sex-selected pheromones are also able to distinguish between male and females for mating and spawning.Sorensen, P. W., & Stacey, N. E. (2004). Brief review of fish pheromones and discussion of their possible uses in the control of non‚Äêindigenous teleost fishes. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 38(3), 399-417 Early Tetrapods and Amphibians Genetics An OR gene radiation co-existed during the time of reptile dominance approximately 200 million years ago. This occurrence would have likely signaled a major speciation event or adaptive shift in the prevalent organisms. The earliest tetrapods thrived in aquatic environments prior to making their initial transition to land. Correspondingly, modern amphibians too began in water before emerging on land as adults. This dual adaptation was selected for since early tetrapods and modern amphibians could reap the resources of both environments. As a result, modern amphibians possess olfactory organs that are specialized in detecting both volatile and water- soluble odors. Odorants in water are detected in a manner that is akin to fish, in which a respiratory pump is responsible for filling their nasal cavity with water.Reiss, J. O., & Eisthen, H. L. (2008). Comparative anatomy and physiology of chemical senses in amphibians. Sensory evolution on the threshold: Adaptations in secondarily aquatic vertebrates University of California Pres, 43-63. Coelacanths are widely referred to as the intermediate between fish and tetrapods since they contain limb-like protrusions. One such species, Latimeria chalumnae, holds particular interest since they contain Class II OR genes that are present in mammals and amphibians but are absent in fish.Freitag, J., Ludwig, G., Andreini, I., R√∂ssler, P., & Breer, H. (1998). Olfactory receptors in aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates. Journal of Comparative Physiology A, 183(5), 635-650. Acting as a close living relative to tetrapods, recent studies elucidating the coelacanth OR repertoire state that the common ancestor of mammals and fish had both Class I and II OR genes. Structure Tetrapods exhibit both a main and accessory olfactory system. The main olfactory sense is derived from the more ancient neural system, broadly present across insects and mammals.Smith, T. D., Rossie, J. B., & Bhatnagar, K. P. (2007). Evolution of the nose and nasal skeleton in primates. Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews, 16(4), 132-146. This system is specialized to detect volatile, airborne molecules. The accessory olfactory system is the more recently evolved structure, first appearing in the common ancestor of modern amniotes and amphibians. The detection of non- volatile molecules and chemoreception seems to be the primary function of this system, as the accessory organ (Jacobson‚Äôs organ) contains vomeronasal receptors responsible for environmental sampling.Rouquier, S., & Giorgi, D. (2007). Olfactory receptor gene repertoires in mammals. Mutation Research/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis, 616(1), 95-102. Quantitative research has suggested that the relative size of the main olfactory bulb is highly correlated with ecological adaptations, while the relative size of the accessory olfactory bulb is related to sociosexual factors.Barton, R. A., Purvis, A., & Harvey, P. H. (1995). Evolutionary radiation of visual and olfactory brain systems in primates, bats and insectivores. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences, 348(1326), 381-392. Evolutionary loss of the accessory olfactory system is observed in multiple tetrapod lineages, which is believed to be caused by the overlapping redundancy of function with the main olfactory system.Smith, T. D., & Bhatnagar, K. P. (2004). Microsmatic primates: reconsidering how and when size matters. The Anatomical Record Part B: The New Anatomist, 279(1), 24-31. Correspondingly, the reduction of vomeronasal receptor genes is often attributed to the transition of tetrapods from water to land.Shi, P., & Zhang, J. (2007). Comparative genomic analysis identifies an evolutionary shift of vomeronasal receptor gene repertoires in the vertebrate transition from water to land. Genome research, 17(2), 166-174. However, with the exception of the archosaur clade, the accessory olfactory system is at least primitively possessed (vestigially) in all higher taxa of tetrapods. The skull of the extinct Hadrocodium wui, which are considered reptiles that evolved into the first mammals, has unveiled significant implications of the reptilian olfactory transition. In comparison to their descendants, CT scans of these craniums revealed that the olfactory bulb had increased in size over large timescales. This sequence of events culminated the origin of mammalian olfaction, suggesting an OR gene shift from reptiles to mammals.Rowe, T. B., Macrini, T. E., & Luo, Z. X. (2011). Fossil evidence on origin of the mammalian brain. Science, 332(6032), 955-957. Mammals Genetics The olfactory genetics of mammals are divergent from the vertebrate lineage when looking at the size of the OR gene family. Alone, this family of genes makes up 1% of the entire active genome and represents the largest gene family for all species.Buck, L. B. (2000). The molecular architecture of odor and pheromone sensing in mammals. Cell, 100(6), 611-618. Therefore, mammals may be evidence of a second adaptation radiation event that occurred. These mammalian OR genes have a tendency to cluster on chromosomal ends or telomeres. Recombination is more rapid at teleomeric sites. These telemetric loci are evidence for OR gene expansion where genes were duplicated quickly. One study used newly developed phylogeny-based methods to classify well over 10,000 OR genes from 13 different placental mammals. The experimenters separated them into orthologous gene groups (OGGs). What they found was that OR gene lineages, which had experienced more gene duplication, had a weaker purifying selection while Class II OR genes evolved dynamically compared to Class 1.Niimura, Y., Matsui, A., & Touhara, K. (2014). Extreme expansion of the olfactory receptor gene repertoire in African elephants and evolutionary dynamics of orthologous gene groups in 13 placental mammals. Genome research, 24(9), 1485-1496. Structure Mammals (unlike other tetrapods) utilize a nose to sense volatile odors. The appearance of nasal turbinates and fossae, which resemble scroll-shaped spongy bones in the nasal passage, is one of the distinctive features of their evolution. These structures are paired on both sides of the midline nasal septum, linking the external nasal opening and the internal nasal aperture together. Evidence for their first appearance are shown in fossils of Therapsida, from which mammals descend. The first true mammals developed additional nasal tissue to carry more neurons that transfer olfactory information to the brain.Miyamichi, K., Amat, F., Moussavi, F., Wang, C., Wickersham, I., Wall, N. R., ... & Luo, L. (2011). Cortical representations of olfactory input by trans-synaptic tracing. Nature, 472(7342), 191-196. Among amniotes, mammals were the first to evolve a complex system of nasal turbinates, which augment the surface area for olfactory epithelium. The complexity of turbinates vary highly across mammalian species, yet a correlation appears to exist among phylogenetic groups rather than the environmental niche.Negus, V. 1958. Comparative anatomy and physiology of the nose and paranasal sinuses. F. and S. Livingstone, EdinburghMoore, W. J. 1981. The mammalian skull. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge Presence of Turbinates The skull of Brasilitherium provides useful information when discerning the emergence of a true nose in mammals. Brasilitherium was not a mammal but indeed a synapsida tetrapod that served as a close predecessor to the first mammaliaforms. The emergence of turbinates can be recognized through the observation of this 227 million year old protomammal.Ruf, I., Maier, W., Rodrigues, P. G., & Schultz, C. L. (2014). Nasal Anatomy of the Non‚Äêmammaliaform Cynodont Brasilitherium riograndensis (Eucynodontia, Therapsida) Reveals New Insight into Mammalian Evolution. The Anatomical Record, 297(11), 2018-2030. The nasal concha, or turbinates, is composed of little bones and soft tissue that provide structure to the nose and aid in the perception of smell. Paleontological work on other protomammals has identified specialized ridges lined between the orbital fissures, superior to the maxillary plate. Research has yet to define a correlation between these ridges and the evidence of turbinates, mostly based on the assumption that they were probably cartilaginous and difficult to preserve. The lack of intact skulls in these early mammals also serves as an impediment to study. The skull of Brasilitherium held more promising results, as it contained a secondary palate separating the nose from the mouth, thereby enhancing skeletal durability and preservation of the turbinate structure. Researchers identified small shards of bone inside the skull‚Äôs nasal cavity that were assumed to be parts of the turbinates. It was inferred that these structures found in Brasilitherium performed the same roles in modern mammals; specifically, the anterior overlying tissue warmed incoming odorants and the posterior portion was responsible for picking up scent. The complex latter section of the nasal structure suggests that Brasilitherium had a well-developed sense of smell. The same studies also found a hollow across the secondary plate, implicating the presence of the Jacobson‚Äôs organ. These observations suggest that this organism possessed features that connect both its tetrapod ancestors and later mammalians. Particularly, the Brasilitherium nose had transitional features that help elucidate the emergence of protruding mammalian noses. Rhinarium Structural changes in rhinaria provide suggestive material for phylogenetic analysis. Generally speaking, the rhinarium is present in most species of mammals and is correlated with an acute sense of smell. Therefore, it is likely that this trait emerged in the protomammal stage.Ade, M. (1999). External morphology and evolution of the rhinarium of lagomorpha. with special reference to the glires hypothesis. Zoosystematics and Evolution, 75(2), 191-216. The adaptations that gave rise to this anatomical structure largely reflected the ecological factors that affected the mammals of the period. In most species with a rhinarium, the organ takes the form of a firm pad with dual nostrils, allowing for the processing of both olfactory and tactile information. As such, the structure of the rhinarium is assumed to be important in the evolution of exploratory behaviour. A common assumption is that higher primates lost the rhinarium secondarily because of their decreasing reliance on olfaction. Primates Genetics One hallmark feature of the Order Primates is the diminished emphasis on olfaction. Smell is often viewed as a mitigated special sense during the emergence of higher neural function, and correspondingly, olfaction has been increasingly reduced throughout the course of primate evolution. Some researchers relate the de- emphasis of smell to the emergence of complex vision. Accordingly, many primate species convey a large proportion of OR pseudogenes, with the highest levels shown in humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas. Humans only contain approximately 400 functional genes, contrasted with the 600 OR pseudogenes present within the genome. The disparity is explained by the development of acute vision in Catarrhini (apes and Old World monkeys) 40 million years ago, namely during the period when the Earth became cooler. Trichromatic vision was evolved to enhance long-distance perception and foraging for ripe fruit, reducing the selective advantage of possessing a large OR gene repertoire. Contrarily, New World howler monkeys (Alouatta) have independently evolved routine trichromatic vision, yet they still perform pheromone communication and do not exhibit reduced olfactory capabilities. It is suggested that although enhanced vision relaxed the selection of sensitive smell, it did not render olfaction as an unneeded trait, and may have been advantageous in a jungle habitat.Gilad, Y., Wiebe, V., Przeworski, M., Lancet, D., & P√§√§bo, S. (2004). Loss of olfactory receptor genes coincides with the acquisition of full trichromatic vision in primates. PLoS Biology, 2(1), e5. Selection In primates, olfaction is primarily important for social signalling and dietary strategies. Ample evidence suggests that olfactory social behaviours, such as sniffing and scent marking, are heavily involved in communicative interactions among primate species. For instance, scent marking with glandular secretions is a prevalent mode of signalling in strepsirrhines. Within the order Catarrhini, all hominoid genera contain specialized cutaneous scent glands (i.e. apocrine glands in the axilla) to detect aromatic cues.Dixon AF (1998) Sexual selection and evolution of seminal vesicles in primates. Fol Primatol 69:300‚Äì306 Recent studies have also drawn connections between olfactory function and mate preference across a broad range of primates, including humans. The Olfaction Tradeoff During the twentieth century, a myriad of theories were developed for the origin of primate sensory adaptations. Evolutionary ‚Äúprogress‚Äù was marked by the adaptive characteristics of visual and tactile structures, yet a reduction in olfactory abilities. This theory was further elaborated by Le Gros Clark, asserting the reduction of olfactory structures was attributed to the diminished need for smell in arboreal environments.Clark, W. L. G. (1935). 2. Man's Place Among the Primates. Man, 1-6. This theory was later challenged with the existence of arboreal mammals that do not exhibit primate traits that are considered ‚Äúadaptive‚Äù (specifically, reduced olfaction), yet they are still successful within their respective environment.Cartmill, M. A. T. T. (1974). Pads and claws in arboreal locomotion. Primate locomotion, 45-83. Furthermore, strepsirrhine primates demonstrate the social behavior of scent-marking in both terrestrial and arboreal habitats.Lewis, R. J. (2006). Scent marking in sifaka: no one function explains it all. American journal of primatology, 68(6), 622-636. Arboreal New World primates (Platyrrhini) possess skin scent- glands and also exhibit the same scent-marking traits as do strepsirrhines. Studies have provided a structural explanation for the reduced olfaction in primates, proposing that degeneration of the nasal region resulted from crowding of the nasal cavity in conjunction with progressively convergent orbits. Structure Aside from an external nose structure, some primates contain a vomeronasal organ to detect odorants of higher molecular weight. Genomic analysis has asserted that vomeronasal organ receptors became impaired approximately 23 million years ago in primate evolution, before the advent separation of Old World monkeys and hominoids. Furthermore, multiple lines of evidence depict that the entire accessory olfactory system became nonfunctional in pheromonal communication before this divergence took place.4 Cave AJE. 1973. The primate nasal fossa. Biol J Linnaeus Soc, London 5:377‚Äì387.Laska M, Seibt A, Weber A. 2000. ‚Äò‚ÄòMicrosmatic‚Äô‚Äô primates revisited: olfactory sensitivity in the squirrel monkey. Chem Senses 25:47‚Äì53.0 Laska M, Rivas Bautista RM, Hernandez Salazar LT. 2006. Olfactory sensitivity for aliphatic alcohols and aldehydes in spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi). Am J Phys Anthropol 129:112‚Äì120. Currently, no structure of the vomeronasal organ has been elucidated in Old World monkeys, although it has been shown that an apparent vestigial vomeronasal organ develops but degenerates before birth. Conversely, human embryos possess a vomeronasal organ that persists, although this feature is vestigial throughout their lifetime. Primates are phylogenetically divided into Strepsirrhini, species that possess a curly ‚Äúwet nose‚Äù rhinarium, and Haplorhini, those that possess a dry ‚Äúsimple nose‚Äù structure. Strepsirrhines are considered to have more primitive features and adaptations because of their preservation of heightened smell. In haplorrhine primates, the loss of the wet rhinarium and reduced number of turbinates are correlated with their diminished reliance on smell. Accordingly, the dry noses of humans place them under the Haplorhini clade as well.Williams, B. A., Kay, R. F., & Kirk, E. C. (2010). New perspectives on anthropoid origins. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 107(11), 4797-4804. Human Genetics More than 900 human OR genes and pseudogenes have been identified.Glusman, G., Yanai, I., Rubin, I., & Lancet, D. (2001). The complete human olfactory subgenome. Genome research, 11(5), 685-702. Close to 63% of the ORs are changed by a random process of pseudogene formation. These ORs constitute 17 gene families, of which only 4 contain more than 100 members each. There are Class I ORs, Fish-like, which form 10% of the human repertoire all on one cluster on chromosome 11. ORs are present on all human chromosomes with the exception of 20 and the male sex chromosome ‚ÄòY‚Äô. 80% of all ORs are found in clusters containing anywhere from 6-138 genes. A comparative cluster analysis study traced the evolutionary pathway that led to OR proliferation and diversification. The study concluded the following expansion history 1) a Class II OR cluster on chromosome 11 was generated via local duplication 2) Single-step duplication from the cluster on chromosome 11 to chromosome 1 3) A storm of duplication events from chromosome 1 to other chromosomes. Structure In recent humans, nasal configuration is mostly associated with nasal bridge elevation and width of the internal nasal cavity. Emergence of such a structure mainly derives from respiratory needs in varying climates; for instance, a large nasal cavity in Neanderthals adjusted for the cold environment and low humidity of that epoch.Napier, J. R., & Napier, P. H. (1967). A handbook of living primates. In higher primates, the structural reduction of the snout is correlated with diminished priority for olfaction. As such, the human nose displays reduced innervations of the olfactory mucous membrane, decreased snout length, and an overall reduction of complexity of the nasal concha. Selection The role of smell has long been viewed as secondary to the importance of auditory, tactile, and visual senses. Humans do not rely on olfaction for survival to the same extent as other species. Instead, smell plays a heavier role in aesthetic food perception and gathering information on the surroundings. Nevertheless, humans also communicate via odorants and pheromones, exerting both subconscious and conscious (artificial) scents. For example, olfaction is able to mediate the synchronization of menstrual cycles for females living in close proximity.Stern, K., & McClintock, M. K. (1998). Regulation of ovulation by human pheromones. Nature, 392(6672), 177-179. Interindividual Variation Humans have a high interindividual variation in pseudogenes and OR genes which research attributes to geographical and cultural separation. Selection and cultural practices can conserve OR genes even though it is likely caused by bottleneck effects and geographic isolation.Alonso, S., L√≥pez, S., Izagirre, N., & de la R√∫a, C. (2008). Overdominance in the human genome and olfactory receptor activity. Molecular biology and evolution, 25(5), 997-1001. A weak positive selection acting on human nucleotide diversity is proposed because of a report that observed genomic segments in a 450kb cluster of olfactory genes found on chromosome 17. They observed a lower ratio of nucleotide diversity to divergence in intact genes compared to introns and pseudogenes. Additionally a small but significant reduction in variability was observed in the OR gene cluster when compared to other genomic areas. Geographically and culturally distinct human populations differ when comparing regions on chromosome 17 (looking at SNPs) in coding regions of 400-kb olfactory receptor gene clusters. These differences are proposed to help with future genotype- phenotype studies such as evaluating the effect of genetic drift on these populations and finding greater functionality in pygmyolfactory receptor genes and pseudogenization. 3 million SNPs in the HapMap database of four populations was analyzed, and it was found that heterozygotes dominate significantly. Because of the double amount of odorant binding sites it is theorized that heterozygotes are selected for. This could be an evolutionary response to current human olfactory receptor loss. Mouse and Human OR Repertoires Comparisons between human and mouse OR gene repertoires have been well documented in genomic and phylogenetic analysis. Identifying the orthologous relationship between their genes provides key translating data from mouse studies in understanding human olfaction. Approximately 63% of the human OR repertoire has degenerated to pseudogenes, whereas mice only exhibit 20% of pseudogenization. In addition, human OR genes lack motifs that are highly conserved in mouse OR genomes, implicating that not all human OR genes encode functional OR proteins. These differences are explained by the reduced reliance of smell in humans in comparison to rodents.Stoddart, D. M. (Ed.). (1980). Olfaction in mammals. Academic P. It is still unclear whether the extensive OR repertoires of mice enable them to detect a larger range of odorants than humans. When human OR sequences are analyzed phylogenetically, intact human genes are found in most OR subfamilies. Assuming that various OR subfamilies bind to different odorant classes, it is likely that humans are able to detect a wide range of smell similarly to mice. Loss of Olfactory Capacity Similarly to humans, whales and dolphins have experienced an independent loss of functional OR genes. This is demonstrated by the organism's return to an aquatic environment, subsequently experiencing a loss of terrestrial olfactory register. Olfactory senses are generally more heightened for a terrestrial species than for an aquatic, as airborne volatiles are more important to detect than water-soluble scents in land animals. Support for this theory is exemplified through the fish-to-tetrapod transition, where animals began to populate terrestrial niches and a tremendous expansion of the olfactory system can be observed. Once cetaceans evolved from their terrestrial ancestors, the reduction in their olfactory apparatus was primarily clade-specific. Toothed whales (Odontoceti) seem to have lost their olfactory sense completely, whereas Baleen whales have shown partial impairment, expressing about 58% OR pseudogenes in their cluster. Some adult tooth whales express 77% OR pseudogenes and are completely devoid of olfactory structures. This occurrence is analogous to that of the blind Southern marsupial mole, in which mutation of the inter-photoreceptor protein was paired with anatomical degeneration of the eyes.Kishida, T., Thewissen, J. G. M., Hayakawa, T., Imai, H., & Agata, K. (2015). Aquatic adaptation and the evolution of smell and taste in whales. Zoological Letters, 1(1), 9. Two other marine vertebrates, the Steller sea lion and the loggerhead turtle, display a rather low number of pseudogenes with respect to cetaceans. The preservation of their OR genes is correlated with their semi-adaptation to an aquatic habitat, since these organisms still perform many functions on land (e.g. mating, basking). Cetaceans do not depend on terrestrial environments, and have thusly lost a large fraction of their OR repertoire. Echolocation was presumable evolved to compensate for this loss. Psychophysical Implications Previous research has elucidated the psychophysical and behavioural characteristics of olfactory adaptation. Adaptation allows for the olfactory system to appropriately respond to the appearance of novel scents or changes, yet it also maintains equilibrium with odorant concentrations in ambient environments. Like other sensory systems, prolonged exposure to an odorant often leads to a stimulus-specific decrease in olfactory sensitivity to that particular odor; however, the absence of further exposure will regain olfactory sensitivity.Dalton, P. (2000). Psychophysical and behavioral characteristics of olfactory adaptation. Chemical Senses, 25(4), 487-492. Psychophysical analysis has demonstrated both an elevation of odor thresholds and a diminished responsivity to suprathreshold stimulation under the effects of olfactory adaptation. In addition, evidence suggests that the time course of adaptation and recovery relies on the duration and concentration of the odor. It is generally understood that olfactory adaptation involves both receptor level and post-receptor components (peripheral and central regions, respectively). Support for the participation of both systems derives from experiments showing that monorhinal stimulation results in both ipsilateral and contralateral adaptation. However, the degree of adaptation is more profound in the ipsilateral nostril, and recovery appears to be slower. Psychophysical support for this theory draws from studies that have reported relatively small decreases in peripheral response after repeated stimulation despite significant reductions in behaviorally perceived intensity. Unlike vision and hearing, olfactory chemical stimulation does not terminate after the removal of the stimulus. As such, although some degree of olfactory adaptation may be attributed to response characteristics of receptors, another influence may be the delay in signal termination within the receptor environment. Consequently, the degree of adaptation may rely on differences in odorant clearance among species, which would include properties of nasal mucociliary, submucosal blood flow, and expiratory desorption.Dalton, P. and Scherer, P. W. (1999) A mass transport model of human olfactory adaptation . Chem. Senses, 24, 561.

On the right, the chapel dedicated to St Jerome has decorative sculpture (1506) by Gasparo da Coirano.Itinerari Brescia entry on church by Fiorenzo Fisogni.

He was born in November 1982 in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Ahmed comes from the renowned Gazi family, who were one of the Baro Bhuyan(Twelve Zaminders of Bengal) in sixteenth century, from the Bhawal Estate now known as Gazipur in Bangladesh. Biography From 2012 to 2014, he worked at VII Photo Agency, working with John Stanmeyer. Nafis did his schooling from Bangladesh International Tutorial, a prominent private schools in Bangladesh. He studied art and design at the Sir John Cass Department of Art, Media & Design of London Guildhall University in London and photography at the Danish School of Media and Journalism in Denmark. Nafis was awarded full scholarship by Istituto Europeo di Design in Madrid to do Masters of Fine Arts in photography. In 2016, Nafis was invited as a scholar at The Center for Social Difference at the prestigious Columbia University. Gazi Nafis Ahmed was awarded at the international Pride Photo Award 2015 held at the historic Oude Kerk, Amsterdam (\\"old church\\") in Amsterdam. There were 3,800 entries from 60 countries around the world. Pride Photo Award is considered to be the most prestigious contest for photography about gender diversity. Nafis won in \\"Stories of Love and Pride\\" category for his series \\"Inner Face\\". In 2013, Nafis received the Blub Award from Format International Photography Festival in the United Kingdom. He is the youngest Bangladeshi artist to have a solo show at the esteemed Bengal Gallery of Fine Arts. Gazi Nafis Ahmed participated at the Mining Warm Data exhibition. It was curated by Diana Campbell Betancourt, artistic director of DAS. In 2014, artworks by Nafis were featured in the landmark show B/Desh in Dhaka Art Summit, the largest platform for South Asian art, curated by Deepak Ananth. His work has been exhibited in UK, Spain, Netherlands, China, India and Bangladesh. Some of the organizations he has worked with are International Finance Corporation of World Bank Group, Medicins Sans Frontieres, UNAIDS, UNDP, WFP, Save The Children. His photos have graced the pages of The New York Times, The New Yorker, and The Guardian, among others. In 2013, Nafis organized the first ever photography forum for the pioneer photographers of Bangladesh called ‚ÄúEvolution of Photography‚Äù at the Edward M Kennedy Center in Dhaka, which gave them a platform to share their experiences and discuss untold rich history of photography in the country. One of his critically acclaimed serial ‚ÄúInner Face‚Äù addresses the sensitive and precarious issues of human rights of the LGBT community. They convey the subtle sense of challenge in the expressions of the community in a traditional and conservative culture like Bangladesh. The photographs seem to carry that sense of ‚Äúconquering‚Äù social taboos, of trying to become free of the manacles that tie the inborn or acquired identity to social norms. Participation at La Biennale di Venezia Gazi Nafis Ahmed represented Bangladesh at the 58th edition of La Biennale di Venezia or Venice Biennale 2019. The venue of the Bangladesh Pavilion is Palazzo Zenobio. The theme of the pavilion is \\"Thirst\\" where Gazi Nafis Ahmed displayed his series \\"Inner Face\\", as a reminder for the thirst for love, acceptance and knowledge.

Like many of his generation he also served as a soldier, both in the First World War and, a couple of decades later, as an Internationalist in the Spanish Civil War. Life Max Roscher was born in Pockau, a small town in the mining region of southern Saxony, close to the Fl√∂ha River. His father worked as a builder and/or cabinet maker. On leaving school he trained for work in the building trade before undertaking a period as an itinerant labourer between 1904 and 1908, working in building construction and in brick works. In 1911 he joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD / Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands). War broke out in August 1914 and Roscher was conscripted into the army. During the war he became a connected with the left-wing Spartacus League. War ended with German defeat, effectively in November 1918, and a year of national and local revolutions ensued. In December 1918 he was participating in the fighting surrounding the Munich \\"Workers' Council Republic, before returning to Saxony later in the month and becoming a member of the \\"Workers' and Soldiers' Council\\" in Marienberg. Like many Spartacus League supporters (and along with a large number of fellow SPD members locally), in March 1919 he joined the recently established German Communist Party. In 1920 he took on leadership of the party team in the Pockau subdistrict, while continuing till 1922 to work in building and construction. In 1923 he was sent by the party to Thuringia to become a full-time party organiser, based in Jena; but he returned to Pockau in the first part of 1924 and became a member of the town council. In May 1924 he successfully stood for election in May 1924, representing the Communist Party, elected for the Chemnitz-Zwickau electoral district. His time in the national legislature (Reichstag) was relatively brief, however. After just seven months another general election was held in December 1924. The outcome was a loss of support for parties of the extreme left and the extreme right, which ushered in a period of relative political stability in Germany, but Max Roscher was one of those Communists who failed to secure re-election. After his Reichstag career came to an end, Roscher became the regional party secretary for Agitation and Propaganda, for Chemnitz-Erzbirge. His arrest for \\"insurgency action\\" (\\"Aufstandsaktion\\") in February 1925 reflected his party responsibilities: he remained in prison till November 1925. However, in the 1926 regional elections he was able to stand for election as a Communist Party candidate, and he was elected a member of the Saxony regional legislature (\\"Landtag\\"), retaining his seat till 1929. During the comradely feuding that hit the Communist Party in 1928/29 Max Roscher stuck firmly to the party line laid down by the Central Committee, and remained a member of the party group in the regional assembly. He was also party head for the Fl√∂ha Valley sub- district from 1927 or 1928, transferring later to the same position for the Freiberg sub-district a short distance to the east. Early in 1931 he was arrested and in September of the same year sentenced to twenty months in prison for \\"preparation for high treason\\". However, his health was by now seen to be failing, and because of this he was released early. By September 1932 he was back in his position as party head for the Freiberg sub-district. In January 1933 the NSDAP (Nazi Party) took power and lost little time in switching to one-party government in Germany. All political parties (other than the Nazi Party) were now illegal, but the new Chancellor had, in opposition, been particularly vitriolic about the Communist Party. In February 1933 Roscher emigrated to Czechoslovakia. He returned to Germany and settled in Dresden in August 1933, resuming his (now illegal) party work, but in December 1933 was back in Prague, in a hospital, thanks to his failing health. Subsequently, probably in 1934, the party sent him to Kharkiv (at that time in the Soviet Union) where he underwent a lengthy convalescence and also worked as an instructor for The Party. With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, in 1936, he joined the International Brigades. In Spain he fought in the Edgar Andr√© Bataillon. However, he was badly wounded in fighting outside Madrid in November 1936 after which he moved to Paris which was where the exiled German Communist Party had set up its headquarters. In April 1939 he was taken to the Soviet Union where he was accommodated in a rest home for wounded fighters from the Spanish Civil War, set up at Peredelkino, a dacha complex just outside Moscow. It was here that he would die in August 1940. Family connections Max Roscher was the father of Paul Roscher, a successful politician in the German Democratic Republic and, between 1963 and 1989, a member of that country's powerful (ruling) Party Central Committee. Honours The Second World War ended in May 1945 and what remained of Germany was divided into zones of occupation by the winning powers. Saxony, where Max Roscher had lived, became part of the Soviet occupation zone which, in October 1949, was relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic. Within the new country there was much official adulation for the memory of Max Roscher. A military regiment was named \\"Sch√ºtzenregiment 7 ‚ÄûMax Roscher‚Äú\\" in Marienberg: a torpedo vessel in the People's Navy was named the \\"Max Roscher\\". Technical colleges were named after him in M√ºlsen and in Borstendorf, as were a stockings and hosiery factory in Gornau, a youth hostel in Frauenstein, a major agricultural co-operative in Wernsdorf and a street in Freiberg.

The Campaign to Stop Killer Robots is a coalition of non-governmental organizations who seek to pre-emptively ban lethal autonomous weapons. History First launched in April 2013, the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots has urged governments and the United Nations to issue policy to outlaw the development of lethal autonomous weapons systems, also known as LAWS. Several countries including Israel, Russia, South Korea, the United States, and the United Kingdom oppose the call for a preemptive ban, and believe that existing international humanitarian law is sufficient enough regulation for this area. In 2017, Campaign to Stop Killer Robots released a short film, Slaughterbots, \\"depicting a dystopian future where terrorists could unleash swarms of tiny drones capable of identifying and killing specific people.\\" In December 2018, a global Ipsos poll quantified growing public opposition to fully autonomous weapons. It found that 61% of adults surveyed across 26 countries oppose the use of lethal autonomous weapons systems. Two-thirds of those opposed thought these weapons would ‚Äúcross a moral line because machines should not be allowed to kill,\\" and more than half said the weapons would be ‚Äúunaccountable.\\" A similar study across 23 countries was conducted in January 2017, which showed 56% of respondents were opposed to the use of these weapons. In November 2018, the United Nations Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres called for a ban on killer robots, stating, \\"For me there is a message that is very clear ‚Äì machines that have the power and the discretion to take human lives are politically unacceptable, are morally repugnant, and should be banned by international law.\\" In July 2018, over 200 technology companies and 3,000 individuals signed a public pledge to \\"not participate nor support the development, manufacture, trade, or use of lethal autonomous weapons.\\" In July 2015, over 1,000 experts in artificial intelligence signed on to a letter warning of the threat of an arms race in military artificial intelligence and calling for a ban on autonomous weapons. The letter was presented in Buenos Aires at the 24th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-15) and was co-signed by Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, Noam Chomsky, Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn and Google DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis, among others. In June 2018, Kate Conger, then a journalist for Gizmodo and now with the New York Times, revealed Google's involvement in Project Maven, a US Department of Defense-funded program that sought to autonomously process video footage shot by surveillance drones. Several Google employees resigned over the project, and 4,000 other employees sent a letter to Sundar Pichai, the company's chief executive, protesting Google's involvement in the project and demanding that Google not \\"build warfare technology.\\" Facing internal pressure and public scrutiny, Google released a set of Ethical Principles for AI which included a pledge to not develop artificial intelligence for use in weapons and promised not to renew the Maven contract after it expires in 2019.

Robert Burns paid tribute to her as \\"a votary of the Muses\\". Life Maria Woodley was the daughter of William Woodley, Governor of the Leeward Islands. She accompanied him on a visit to the islands in 1788 and wrote an account of it.Voyages to Madeira and the Leeward and Caribbean Islands (Edinburgh 1792). In 1791 she married Walter Riddell of Glenriddell, Dumfriesshire, younger brother of Robert Burns's patron Robert Riddell, and the pair set up house at an estate called Woodley Park (now known as Goldielea) in the historical county of Kirkcudbrightshire. Burns, a guest at literary parties there, became a close friend and critic of Maria Riddell, writing several love songs for her. In early 1794, he made a drunken overture to her, which resulted in them quarrelling and Burns losing the support of his patron, who died that year. Maria and her husband were reconciled with Burns in 1795, when she sent a poem of appeasement.The Feminist Companion to Literature in English, eds Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy (London: Batsford, 1990), pp. 246‚Äì247. When Burns died in 1796, Maria wrote an admired account of him for the Dumfries Journal. She was also a friend of the novelist and poet Helen Craik, another admirer of Burns. She included some poems by Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire and Mary Darwall in her 1802 anthology, The Metrical Miscellany. Her husband lost Woodley Park and another property and died at the end of the century. Maria Riddell and her two children moved to Hampton Court as pensioners. In 1807, she married a Welsh landowner, Phillips Lloyd Fletcher, and is buried in the Fletcher family vault at Chester.

He was best known for creating roles in new operas by British composers from the 1840s to the early 1860s. Among those who composed for him were William Vincent Wallace, Michael William Balfe and Julius Benedict. After working for Alfred Bunn at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, Harrison set up a company in partnership with the soprano Louisa Pyne, which enjoyed success in North America and London in the 1850s. Life and career Harrison was born in Marylebone, London, the son of a coal merchant.Kingsford, C L. \\"Harrison, William (1813‚Äì1868)\\", rev. John Rosselli, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, retrieved 14 April 2015 He appeared in public as an amateur tenor in 1836 and in October of that year he became a student at the Royal Academy of Music, then headed by Cipriani Potter.Husk, W H. \\"Harrison, William\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, retrieved 14 April 2015 He made his professional debut the following year, singing with the Sacred Harmonic Society. His first operatic work was at Covent Garden in May 1839 in the premiere of William Michael Rooke's Henrique. The librettist and impresario Alfred Bunn recruited him for his opera seasons at Drury Lane in the 1840s, during which Harrison created tenor leads in Balfe's The Bohemian Girl (1843), Wallace's Maritana (1845) and other new works. in 1854 Harrison and the soprano Louisa Pyne led a company of British singers to North America. They opened in New York on 9 October with a repertory of light Italian and French operas, sung in English, together with The Bohemian Girl, Maritana and The Beggar's Opera. This venture was successful. In the summer season of 1855 the company had a 125-night run in New York and they toured throughout the next three years in major cities of Canada and the US. Returning to England in 1857 they staged similar repertory in London for the next seven seasons, premiering fifteen new British operas. By the 1860s Harrison's voice was in decline, and composers such as Julius Benedict in The Lily of Killarney (1862) wrote less demanding roles for him. His last appearance was in Liverpool, in May 1868, singing Fritz in The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein. Harrison married Ellen, daughter of the actress Maria Clifford. They had two sons: the elder, William, became rector of Clovelly; the younger son, Clifford, became a professional reciter. Harrison died of pneumonia at his home in Kentish Town, north London.

Subsequently, Paola and Choxi began tutoring students over Skype in 2012, then later introduced Bloc at the Launch Festival in San Francisco. The company raised $250,000 in seed funding in May 2012, another $2 million in December 2013, and $6 million in Series A funding in November 2014. The latest round of funding was with Harrison Metal of First Round Capital. In 2017, Bloc had 96 people enrolled in their user experience design course, of which 14 completed. In April 2018, Bloc was acquired by online bootcamp Thinkful for an undisclosed sum. Officials at Thinkful said Bloc was not profitable and \\"almost breaking even\\" at the time the deal closed.  Courses  Bloc has a total of 5 courses, separated into two phases: foundation, and a building real projects phase. In the last 2 weeks of the courses, students and their mentors will work on a capstone project of their choice. Courses include Rails Web Development, Frontend Web Development, User Experience Design, Android Development, and iOS Development.  Scholarships  Bloc offers two scholarships: the New Relic Diversity Scholarship in Software Development and Design, and the Veterans Scholarship in Software Development and Design. In 2013, Bloc and New Relic created the New Relic Diversity Scholarship in Software Development and Design to promote diversity in software development and UX design. The scholarship caters to females, veterans of the U.S. military, and ethnic minority groups that are underrepresented in the software engineering field; since inception, over 1000 scholarships have been awarded. The Veterans Scholarship in Software Development and Design is offered to U.S. military veterans. The scholarship aims to equip U.S. veterans with the necessary tools for launching their tech careers.

He played college basketball for the University of Iowa and the University of Southern California before playing professionally in Portugal, New Zealand, Mexico, the Philippines, Luxembourg and Israel. High school career Fuller attended Mesa High School in Mesa, Arizona, where he earned all-state and all-conference honors as a junior and senior. As a senior in 2007‚Äì08, he averaged 24.5 points, 10.8 rebounds and 2.1 blocked shots per game, as he led Mesa to a 17‚Äì11 record and an East Valley Region championship. He was named East Valley Region Player of the Year and East Valley Tribune Player of the Year, and was named Player of the Year for Class 4A-5A in Arizona by the Arizona Republic. College career Fuller (shooting) with Iowa in February 2010 As a freshman for Iowa in 2008‚Äì09, Fuller appeared in 32 games with 19 starts, while averaging 4.0 points and 2.7 points per game. He scored a season-high 16 points against Penn State on January 24. As a sophomore in 2009‚Äì10, Fuller earned All-Big Ten Honorable Mention honors after averaging 9.7 points and a team-leading 6.2 rebounds in 30 games (22 starts). He posted a team-best six double-doubles and led Iowa in rebounding a team-best 14 times, including 12 of the last 16 games. On February 16, he recorded career-highs of 30 points and 13 rebounds against Michigan. On April 9, 2010, Fuller announced his decision to leave the Hawkeyes basketball program in order to move closer to home and his family. Less than a month later, on May 4, he signed with USC and subsequently redshirted the 2010‚Äì11 season due to NCAA transfer regulations. As a redshirted junior in 2011‚Äì12, Fuller suffered a labral tear in his left (shooting) shoulder in October, and in December he suffered one in his right shoulder. He was later ruled out for the rest of the season in January due to the injuries, opting to have season-ending surgery to deal with the labrum tear in his left shoulder. Shooting with his non-preferred right hand for most of the season, he was second on the Trojans team in scoring (10.6) and first in rebounding (5.9). As a senior in 2012‚Äì13, Fuller's role was dramatically reduced as he started just six games and averaged 14.7 minutes per game. He scored a season-high 15 points against UCLA and finished the season with averages of 4.1 points and 3.6 rebounds in 32 games. At the Trojans' annual awards banquet on April 9, he received the John Rudometkin Award for giving 110% effort throughout the season.

The statue depicts Paul Kruger, the Boer political and military leader and President of the South African Republic from 1883 to 1900, and four unnamed Boer soldiers. The Statue of Paul Kruger was sculpted in 1896 and was installed in its current location in Church Square in 1954.  History The statue was first sculpted in 1896 by Anton Van Wouw following a commission by Sammy Marks, an industrialist who made his fortune in the South African Republic, who was an enthusiastic supporter of President Paul Kruger. The statue was first installed at Prince's Park and was then moved to a location outside Pretoria railway station. The statue portrays Paul Kruger wearing a top hat and presidential sash with a cane on a plinth. Along with Paul Kruger, the sculpture has four unnamed Boer soldiers at the corners below the main plinth. In 1956, the statue was moved to its current location at Church Square with a new pedestal and was unveiled there by Daniel Fran√ßois Malan.  Background  In August 1895, the Kruger government was unpopular among the Uitlander mining managers and capitalists of Johannesburg. He has been described by some as autocratic, narrow-minded, and ruthless; rumor had it that the \\"oligarchy\\" (as the government was called then) would soon be overthrown in Pretoria. Marks had his chief accountant draft a proposal to the President and Executive Council offering ¬£10,000 to the city of Pretoria to build a marble statue of Kruger at a place of its subject's choice. However, Marks stipulated that \\"if possible,\\" the statue should be commissioned directly from him, simply requiring whoever was interested to say in whose name and in what bank the money should be deposited. On September 5, Marks got his reply: the Government thanked him \\"for his rich gift\\" and informed him that Kruger deemed Burgers Park an ideal site and pledged for any surplus money to be spent to found the Pretoria Zoo. The money was deposited in a dedicated account at the National Bank of the South African Republic in the name of the Treasurer-General. The Cabinet chiefs and other officials of the Republic debated the finer points of the statue. Dr. Nico Mansvelt, Superintendent of Education and an art expert, considered bronze preferable to marble given the latter's lesser ability to handle the Transvaal climate; Mansvelt also believed the Government should approve the order rather than leaving it up to Marks himself. Marks agreed and soon they settled on Van Wouw, a completely unknown figure in the art world.  Van Wouw and his design  The Dutchman Van Wouw came to the ZAR as a young man and settled in Pretoria, teaching drawing classes at the state gymnasium and a girls' school after a brief stint as a store clerk. An admirer of Kruger's like Marks, Van Wouw considered the President's tailcoat and top hat an inseparable part of him, something which critics would later lambaste Van Wouw for portraying. To them he replied: \\"Without them I would not recognize him! With the tailcoat and top hat, I would! \\"Van Wouw tried to portray the \\"everyday\\" Kruger: Kruger on his porch, with citizens at 6:00 in the morning seeking him out not necessarily to discuss politics but perhaps simply to seek advice on healing a sick cow or consolation on a recent loss. For Van Wouw, Kruger was the cornerstone of independence, and the monument should therefore reflect his \\"everyday\\" qualities. His sketch model portrayed Kruger in formal state attire, standing quietly on the pedestal, in what Van Wouw considered a paternal attitude. Two of the four Boers portrayed below his statue were from the Voortrekker time and two were from Van Wouw's epoch, and each surveyed to one of the four cardinal directions. They were meant not to be trained soldiers but typical citizen militias: sedentary but watchful, surrounding Van Wouw's central figure and symbol of Kruger's position as father in the heart of his people and of the Republic's freedom. Marks and members of the Volksraad and Executive Council of the Republic came to view the sketch, which was approved. On October 7, 1896, more than thirteen months after Marks' initial donation, he and Kruger agreed to have Van Wouw leave for Europe to supervise the work in France and Italy. He remained abroad until April 1, 1898, when he returned to Pretoria. In the meantime, he worked on the monument for ¬£40 a month on a two-year deadline (along with reimbursement for forging and casting expenses). His family was also granted free travel to and from Europe, including work sites there. By December 1896, he was in Europe, first discussing his proposals with the Envoy of the Republic and experts on modeling and casting in the Netherlands. The Envoy, J. G. T. Beelaerts van Blokland, worried that the top hat would cast a shadow over Kruger's face and hide his features, to which Van Wouw held firm, explaining that it would be unthinkable for a Transvaal Boer such as Kruger to stand hat-less under the African sun. The Envoy's only contribution to the final work was a Bible quote on one side of the pedestal, namely Psalm 91:15-16: > He will call on me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble, I > will deliver him and honor him. With long life I will satisfy him and show > him my salvation. According to the Envoy, Kruger was partial to the verses, but Kruger was unhappy with praise to him given his belief that such should only go to God, therefore asking to substitute Psalm 105:4-5: > Look to the Lord and his strength; seek his face always. Remember the > wonders he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced. Due to the circumstances under which the monument was raised, this wish went unfulfilled and no text appeared on the pedestal.  The search for inspiration  When Van Wouw began modeling the Voortrekker figures under fire, he did not know what they looked in full regalia, unlike the familiar Kruger himself and the two modern Boers he simply showed as he had seen them since arrival, namely with a beard, a bandolier, and a Martini‚ÄìHenry gun. No photos and precious few descriptions survived of old Voortrekker gear, however, so Van Wouw wired Pretoria to send him a full Voortrekker kit, including a powder horn, bandolier, and flintlock. The government struggled to find clothes from the era at the Transvaal Museum but gathered what they needed from citizens of the Rustenburg district who still had pieces. Another problem arose with the four bronze panels Van Wouw's model had separating the sentries on each side of the pedestal. Each panel was to show an event from Kruger's life, starting with his teenage shepherding beside his father during the Great Trek. Unable to find surviving photos or other information from this time, Van Wouw got permission to instead start with the signing of the 1881 peace accord ending the First Boer War at O'Neill's Cottage in Laing's Nek. At that event, then Vice-President Kruger set the conditions with the British representatives for their withdrawal after a resounding Boer victory at the Battle of Majuba Hill, including securing the independence of the Boers given up by Sir Theophilus Shepstone in 1877. The second bronze panel also posed problems, and Van Wouw considered scrapping it until the State Secretary of the South African Republic persuaded him to keep the scene of the 29-year-old commandant of Rustenburg leaping into the fray among enemy soldiers at the Battle of Makapansgat. Once again, however, no photograph or detailed description was at hand, prompting the Secretary to send an expedition (including an eyewitness of the battle and a photographer) to photograph relevant areas of the cave. The pictures and relevant captions were sent to Van Wouw in Rome with commentary from former commandant Hercules Malan of Rustenburg. A diptych of bronze panels were to depict events related to the First Boer War, since it was Kruger's resistance to annexation then that set the stage for his future statesmanship. One of them showed Kruger delivering the Paardekraal Covenant, an address delivered to thousands near what is now Krugersdorp proclaiming armed resistance on December 8, 1880; this panel was to accompany that depicting the Peace of Laing's Nek. Once again, visual evidence was lacking, with no photos available from the Paardekraal event and only a drawing from The Illustrated London News of the 1881 treaty signing at O'Neill's Cottage that Van Wouw considered a poor depiction of the moment. The Transvaal government once more helped by providing photos of people that would appear in the panels, Boer women in typical finery, and typical gatherings of Boers with ox-wagons such as communion masses. The fourth panel would depict Kruger's first swearing-in ceremony as President in 1883. This was the only panel not to vex Van Wouw, who was in Holland at the time but would later attend the President's third inauguration in Church Square in 1893.  The making of the statue  Van Wouw set up shop in a studio in Rome shortly after arriving in Europe. Like other sculptors there, he hired artists to model his designs, but was dissatisfied in what he saw as a misunderstanding of the national character of a Transvaal Boer as depicted in the bas-reliefs. Admiring Boer valor in the First Boer War and the Jameson Raid, the Europeans depicted their facial features not as salt-of-the-earth but as possessing the ethereal qualities of a saint or a prophet, leading Van Wouw to opt for completing the work for himself out of frustration. He sought exacting detail, down to a single shoe, thereby taking three and a half months on just one of the Boer sentinels. Under these circumstances as well as that of chronic illness, the original deadline of April 1, 1899 came and went. Van Wouw advocated through State Secretary Willem Johannes Leyds and thereby won a year extension from Marks, whose business partner Lord Isaac Lewis's frequent progress checks betrayed someone \\"with no real idea of art\\" who \\"thought an artwork could be made with the same mentality as a board\\" in Van Wouw's estimation. The sculptor told Lewis \\"that I will never compromise Kruger's monument or my good name for any lucre.\\" He wrote to his father shortly afterward: > ...they can work high or low, I will continue my work, do my duty, and try > to fully convey my impression of the national character of the Transvaal > people and their Kruger. After all, it would be ridiculous to sacrifice > one's public work for a few months of profit. It would be worse if the work > was a failure, but I am working that it may not be one. You or someone else > must speak to Lord Marks about it, however, as I am right now facing this > alone. By May 1898, Van Wouw had finished three of the five planned plaster-cast models: the one of the Kruger, standing 4.5 m (14 ft 9 in), and the two modern Boer sentinels, each 2.22 m (7 ft 3¬Ω in) high. Kruger's right hand was shown on his cane and his left a rolled-up document, while he appeared to face down and to the left at a crowd at his feet; he starkly contrasts the tense Boers, one with a thick beard, head up, and his finger on the trigger of his Martini- Henry, the other with a thinner beard raising his shoulder to hoist a full bandolier. Van Wouw now needed to find a professional to cast them in bronze. He had queried the best casters in Holland shortly after arriving in Europe and settled on Royal Dutch Gold and Silver Workshop or J.M. van Kempen and Sons, who could not handle statues of this size, sending him on to Rome. On May 21, 1898, after six months there, he contracted with Franciscus Bruno to complete the entire work \\"in line with fashion and all rules of perfect art,\\" the latter craftsman agreeing to cast in bronze all models completed in the next five months by January 21, 1899, as well as any finished in the five months after within three months of delivery. Also responsible for safe transport from Van Wouw's workshop to Bruno's forge and suitable packaging for shipping to South Africa, Bruno would be guaranteed 39,500 lire (at the time around ¬£2360), a quarter for delivering the Kruger figure itself, a quarter for that of two modern Boers, and the rest for completion and packaging of all castings. Van Wouw would be able to inspect the work at the foundry at any time. Bruno had agreed with Van Wouw on using a 92% copper, 8% tin mixture for the bronze, while Van Wouw worked on the Voortrekkers and the bas-reliefs. He had eight months to plaster-cast the Voortrekkers: one with his left elbow on his knee, his chin folded in his hands, and a gun's muzzle on the ground with its butt-stock on his right leg; the other with a long beard and a few wrinkles on his forehead, seated upright with his gun in both hands. The modeling work was done in 1899, along with the casting for three of the five pieces, allowing Van Wouw to pivot to the panels - one of which had already been finished by the end of 1898. It is unknown how long the remaining three took: from his letters, Van Wouw appears to have finished all of them, including decorative ornaments (such as a large \\"K\\" monogram) by June 1899. Overseeing the rest of the casting, he returned to Pretoria in September‚ÄìOctober of that year, where he would oversee the erection of the statue and fulfill the second portion of his contract with Marks.  Shattered dreams  Van Wouw arrived in Pretoria to find a pedestal on Church Square, halfway between the Ou Raadsaal and the new Palace of Justice and just west of the church in the middle of the square. Correspondence from the Gauteng office of the National Archives and Records Service of South Africa show an agreement between Van Wouw and Marks that the latter would choose the best of several exemplars of Scottish granite for material, but given Marks' supervision of the pedestal carving, it's not clear how much input Van Wouw had. Marks also preferred to substitute Kruger's intended Burgers Park with a more accessible location, \\"in the center of the city\\" where every visitor would see it, ideally \\"just west of the church building on the church square and right between the House of Parliament and the Supreme Court.\\" The Executive Council (of which Kruger was chair) debated siting for five months and concurred with Marks on June 2, 1899. In the meantime, Marks had hired an architect, W. J. de Zwaan, to build a pedestal; once the plans were approved, he had a Scottish firm secure and sand the appropriate granite slabs. Sytze Wierda, head of the ZAR Department of Public Works: to him a Transvaal President's statue belonged on Transvaal granite, and only the machinery needed to be imported. He was overruled, however, and Marks had 200 tons of red, smooth-polished Aberdeen granite ready on July 1899 to house the statue. Van Wouw was eager to put up the statue, but Kruger said it had to wait until the war was over, and so it would never be raised in the ZAR. On October 11, 1899, shortly before the cast models and panels were due to arrive in South Africa, the Second Boer War broke out. While they were gradually imported, they could not go past Delagoa Bay, since they were not priority items. Marks had to pay a king's ransom to salvage them and felt it wasn't worth the cost, losing interest when he realized the Boers would lose the war after the British took Pretoria. Marks spent the war on his farm, Zwartkoppies, as a passive spectator, but did receive a visit from Lord Kitchener. Kitchener, on Marks showing him Van Wouw's photographs of the statues, asked Marks to keep them as souvenirs of the people he conquered; Marks replied: \\"They are in Delagoa Bay and cost an arm and a leg, take them off my hands!\\" Kitchener sent the sculptures off on the first ship home with two exceptions: a chest containing the Kruger sculpture and a wooden model of a gun, of no interest to Kitchener, which stayed in the sheds of the African Boating Company in Louren√ßo Marques. Kitchener hoisted the sentinel statues on either side of the driveways leading into the Woolwich and Sandhurst Royal Military Academies, moving them after complaints to a pedestal in front of the Royal School of Military Engineering in Chatham near the Boer War Memorial Arch. Placing them under the care of the Royal Engineers, he later gifted two of them to that branch of the military and took the other two to his estate at Broome Park. Kitcehener was determined that the remaining Kruger statue never be raised on African soil, considering him the personification of what the British called \\"Krugerism.\\" The Pretoria City Council thus received a brief in the name of the Lieutenant Governor of the Transvaal Colony stipulating that the pedestal be removed from its central location and that the Council say where they were moving it, be it Burgers Park or elsewhere. The Council decided on Prince's Park and so there the pedestal was erected. This provoked bitter Afrikaner protest, led by Gen. Louis Botha and his Het Volk party, who complained to the Lieutenant-Governor and told the Council that \\"we are deeply disappointed...and...this can be considered nothing but an insult to our people.\\" He vowed that \\"We know that there are many today who are eager to see our people's traditions dragged through the mud, but we would never have expected such behavior from the City Council of Pretoria, least of all given that so many of you not only knew him but were among his closest friends in the capital.\\" Kitchener eventually transferred Church Square (previously Transvaal federal territory) to the Council with the express condition \\"that no buildings, statues or memorials of any description be erected on, or other improvements effected to the ground, without the sanction of the Lieutenant- Governor being first obtained\\".  The statue's return from exile  The British aimed in the Second Boer War, in the words of Sir Alfred Milner, \\"to wipe out the last trace of Afrikanerism,\\" but in 1906 (four years after the end of the war), Afrikaners managed to elect their own government. Kruger died in 1904, and the Transvaal Colony elected Botha, Commandant-General in the War and then leader of Het Volk, as its Prime Minister, a post in which he would continue from 1910 on for South Africa at large. Botha petitioned Kitchener to return the four sentinels and the panels to South Africa to accompany the statue in Church Square, but Kitchener claimed he couldn't return those in his possession, claiming they were not spoils of war but a gift from Marks. The Pretoria City Council turned to Marks, Van Wouw, and finally Kitchener, but none of them could find the missing statue. After two years of research, the City Council once again asked Marks if he could release the Kruger statue, still stored in Louren√ßo Marques, for construction; Marks insisted he would only do so when the Council agreed to complete the entire monument according to his initial design. The City Council decided to simply recast the missing Boers and panels on the advice of Fanie Eloff, who said it could be done for a mere ¬£380, but while they appropriated ¬£500 for Van Wouw's missing material, they found the plaster casts and sketches unavailable. This left taking bronze casts of the English originals to reforge as the only remaining option, one beyond the means of the Council at an estimated cost of at least ¬£1,760. Once again reaching out to Marks, the Council finally won his agreement to put Kruger up on the pedestal in Prince's Park. On May 24, 1913, Victoria Day, Gen. Schalk Willem Burger, President while Kruger was in Europe from 1900 to 1902, unveiled the statue to the public. Both former Orange Free State President Martinus Theunis Steyn and Botha were absent, the former due to illness and the latter to attend to urgent parliamentary matters. The unveiling coincided with an agriculture fair and was attended by 3,000 citizens. At the ceremony, Burger expressed it hope that the statue would one day take its \\"rightful place\\" in Church Square, and Andries Dani√´l Wynand Wolmarans proclaimed that: \\"I sincerely wish, from my heart and for my people, that this statue be moved to Church Square, to the center of the city, so it can take the place it deserves. There should also be an effort to bring back the missing pieces to South Africa, for one can only understand what Kruger means to his people when he is surrounded by sturdy Boers.\\" Botha contacted Kitchener once more to return the four other figures, to which he agreed to \\"willingly\\" return the two he owned \\"to meet the wish of the people of South Africa,\\" but only in return for copies; the two owned by the Royal Engineers were not his to return, but the Union of South Africa government was free to produce replicas of them at its own expense. Botha was willing to accept this arrangement, but at a cost of ¬£520 per statue for a total of ¬£2,080, he let the issue go. In 1917, Botha had to visit London briefly and was asked by the Mayor to try and secure the statues again, but Botha explained that he had been negotiating for four years in vain with Kitchener and did not wish to continue doing so. The Council once again sought Marks' help to no avail. In August 1920, Edward P. Mathers, editor of the newspaper South Africa, began a press campaign to return the statue with the help of former President Francis William Reitz. Mathers discovered where the missing sculptures were, published the photos in his paper, and asked the Mayor of Chatham to pressure his City Council to help return the two figures there to South Africa, given that \\"as they remain at present they are a menace to the good relationships which I am sure Chatham as all England wishes to be established and preserved between them and the Dutch of South Africa.\\" Mathers also pointed out that South Africa and England had fought on the same side in World War I and that \\"spoils of conquest\\" from Afrikaners should be replaced with \\"trophies of our enemies\\" there. The Mayor of Chatham replied that the statues belonged not to the Council but to the Royal Engineers, who in turn said returning the artwork required the consent of the full membership. The officer corps there said that even though South Africa would volunteer to complete the task, they were unwilling to part with a memento of the \\"brave and honourable men\\" whom they fought against in 1899-1902 and fought alongside in 1914‚Äì1918; they also treasured the donation from the late Lord Kitchener (who had died in 1916), whom they held \\"in special regard and honour.\\" Therefore, copies made at South Africa's expense were all the nation would get. While the public campaign to return the statue failed, Gen. Jan Smuts also put in his efforts. Succeeding Botha after the latter's death in 1919 as Prime Minister of the Union, Smuts was popular in Britain for his contributions to the war effort and the Paris Peace Conference. Smuts enlisted Milner in November 1920, appealing to the latter's desire to mend his unpopularity post-Boer-War with a gesture of gratitude to the Afrikaners' newly proven loyalty. Milner contacted the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, the King, and the executors of the Kitchener estate. On January 18, 1921, Smuts received a telegram from Milner \\"that His Majesty, the \\"Colonel-in-Chief\\" of the Royal Engineers, has agreed to donate the two Boer figures and the panels in Chatham as a gift to the Government of the Union of South Africa, and that Lord Kitchener's executors and His Majesty's Government will also provide the South African Government with the two other figures currently in Broome Park.\\" The Union had to pay any transport costs, as already agreed to. On August 23, 1921, the complete monument came off the ship in Cape Town, and on September 12 of that year, it arrived at last in Pretoria. All that was missing was the monogram \\"K,\\" which was lost and never returned.  The last struggle: 1925-1954  Assuming the monument would never be built, the Pretoria City Council authorized a World War I memorial on Church Square, but then Mayor of Pretoria George Brink responded to an August 13, 1920 protest from Mrs. H. Jooste (of the National Party Women's Auxiliary) by declaring that there would be no monument whatsoever there. The memorial would be put in front of the Union Buildings and the Kruger statue on the square in front of the Pretoria railway station, on the same pedestal that once sat on Church Square and in Prince's Park. Prime Minister J. B. M. Hertzog unveiled the statue on October 10, 1925, the centennial of Kruger's birth, while surrounded by the flags of the Orange Free State and ZAR in front of a crowd of 25,000. The ceremony was attended by, among others, the Governor-General and his spouse, as well as the entire Cabinet. Hertzog gave the keynote address, but Gen. Smuts and Wolmarans both spoke as well. While Hertzog and Smuts concentrated on the subject's character and deeds, Wolmarans once more emphasized that Station Square could not hold a candle to Church Square, \\"the heart of Kruger City,\\" as a suitable place for the statue. Over the years, organizations such as the Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurvereniginge, the S.A. Vrouefederasie (South African Women's Federation and the Pretoria Cultural Council petitioned the City Council to move the statue to Church Square. In fact, the Kruger Committee met with over 20,000 members in October 1936 to pressure the Mayor, but the Council was unmoved. The Cultural Council's Kruger Committee, chiefly tasked with holding the annual Kruger Festival, spun off on its own as the Kruger Society () with just such a relocation as the ultimate goal. Enlisting the help of other Afrikaner cultural organizations, the Society used the centennial reenactment of the Great Trek in 1838 to kick off another advocacy campaign. The City Council fielded thousands of letters from various individuals and organizations, including branches of the Transvaal Education Association, the Organizing Committee of the Paardekraal Voortrekker Centennial Festival, the Carriage Reception Committee, and others; even Anglo groups such as the Sons of England, the New Guard, and the Hatfield Ratepayers Association joined the effort. The City Council stalled, hoping interest would flag, but on March 9, 1939, the Transvaal Provincial Council unanimously motioned for the City Council to solve the matter definitively, and on May 29, the majority of the latter agreed to relocate the statue at no cost to them. The Chairman of the Kruger Society and the Mayor of Pretoria made a joint appeal for citizen donations, earning ¬£4,000 for the relocation. In consultation with Van Wouw, who had never preferred Marks's choice of pedestal, Kruger Society architect J. M. van der Westhuizen planned a new base for the monument. Van Wouw's approval was followed by that of the full Society, which proceeded to arrange for an unveiling on Church Square on October 10, 1941, by Mrs. Rachel Isabella Steyn, widow of the last President of the Orange Free State. At this point, the City Council declared the new pedestal architecturally out of step with Church Square, a matter probed by two architects (Gordon Leith and Vivian Sydney Rees-Poole) and their colleagues from the Kruger Society. It turned out that the Council preferred the southern entrance of the Square as a location for the statue, while the Society favored the center. Van Wouw took the Kruger Society's position in two firm letters stating: > It is my vision for the pedestal, the Boers, and the President's likeness to > coexist as one unit, according to architect's plans in consultation with > myself, on Church Square where the fountain and fishpond are currently. As a > sculptor, I refuse to have the statue I love and care for so much be placed > anywhere where its greatness would fall to the wayside. The center of Church > Square is the designated place and there it must be built. In his other letter, Van Wouw claimed that Kruger himself had personally told the artist in the presence of several Volksraad members that it belonged at that location. Van Wouw's letter came to naught, and the issue was dropped until Gerard Moerdijk, architect of the Voortrekker Monument, suggested placing the statue near the southern entrance to Church Square as the \\"psychological center\\" to what he envisioned as a kind of amphitheater, as the pulpit of a church would be. An honorary stele and bell tower would be built behind the statue, with the Boer figures on the sides rather than around the base of the Kruger statue. The Kruger Society approved the plan, while the City Council suggested an open national competition to gather architect's designs unifying the plaza around the statue, and asked for the Pretoria Institute for Architecture (PIA) and the Kruger Society's cooperation. Both organizations agreed, the latter on the condition that a majority of the judges would have the final say on the chosen design, but the PIA by-laws prohibited its members from participating in outside competitions. At this point a new development emerged: Professor William Holford, Baron Holford proposed a plan to City Council for the overall development of the capital, including the Kruger statue in Church Square. The impressed Council scrapped all previous plans on September 28, 1950, enlisting the Kruger Society to raise the statue on the Square under the conditions of strict adherence to the Holford's plan and Council approval of the final product. The cost and time requirements were quite unpopular, and oral agreements were not forthcoming: the Old Pretoria Society voiced its displeasure openly, and even the Kruger Society eventually rejected it. On June 12, 1951, the Kruger Society decided to abandon Moerdijk's idea of placing the Kruger statue at the southern entrance of Church Square and return to advocating the central location, to which the statue was to be moved by October 10, 1954 (Kruger's birthday), or on December 16, 1954 (the 50th anniversary of Kruger's burial in the Pretoria Old Cemetery on Church Street. Since Kruger dreamed of free passage to the east coast, the Society also decided the statue should face eastward from Church Square. Any changes City Council wanted to make could be introduced later, though the central position would stay. After the Council heard from a delegation of the Society, the former decided on December 20, 1951 to cancel their previous decisions and unanimously embrace the Society's position, on the condition of the Council incurring no costs and having final approval rights. Permission was granted to the Society on November 26, 1952, once approval was gained from the Administrator of Transvaal Province, to begin the relocation. The Council was still bound to Kitchener's prohibition of statues without the Lieutenant-Governor's approval, however, but the Society got the federal Cabinet to approve the plans by minutes no. 298 on February 9, 1953, getting the Administrator's approval in the meantime. Donations were once again sought, with an estimated ¬£20,000 needed, but construction began during fundraising, fostered by Governor-General of South Africa Ernest George Jansen, Prime Minister D. F. Malan, all Provincial Administrators (including that of South West Africa), and all their spouses. Both Anglo and Afrikaner individuals, schools, churches, municipalities, businesses, cultural organizations, and other groups pitched in. On October 10, 1953, Malan laid the cornerstone of a new pedestal in front of a crowd of around 15,000, and Dutch Prime Minister Willem Drees attended and addressed the crowd. The Kruger statue was moved from Pretoria Station on June 25, 1954 and placed on June 28 on the pedestal facing north as the Society had recently decided. One year after the cornerstone was laid, on October 10, 1954, Malan unveiled the monument, complete with the four sentinels.  Controversy Following the end of apartheid in South Africa, there had been calls for the removal of the statue from its location due to it being viewed as an \\"icon of apartheid\\" by some African National Congress activists. In 2015, following the Rhodes Must Fall campaign in Cape Town, the statue of Paul Kruger was vandalized with green paint thrown on it. The Economic Freedom Fighters initially claimed responsibility but later retracted this when the City of Tshwane stated its intent to open a criminal case of malicious damage against the perpetrators. Following the vandalism and a pledge by the EFF to destroy the statue, numerous people voiced support for the statue. Sunette Bridges chained herself to the statue to prevent further damage with Afrikaners in military uniforms starting to guard the statue. A rally also took place next to the statue requesting it to be left alone as part of South Africa's cultural history. This ended with Steve Hofmeyr singing the former national anthem of South Africa, \\"Die Stem van Suid-Afrika\\". The statue has subsequently been ringed by 1.5m high fencing and is not directly accessible to the public.  Sources  * Breytenbach, J. H. (1954). Die Geskiedenis van die Krugerstandbeeld.

It is currently located in Puerto Princesa City, Palawan with currently more than 5,000 students.  History  In 1907, the Palawan High School was established in the town of Cuyo, in Palawan Province. This started as a Junior High School for the first two years of secondary education. The first building was composed of six rooms, which was made of light materials such as \\"pawid\\" and \\"sawali\\" (pawid was made of coconut leaves woven to make a roof and sawali is from small species of bamboo). But, there were a shortage of students, with only eight students in the first and second year. Because there were also a shortage of qualified teachers, the school ended up closing and reopening for the 1922-1923 school year. Palawan National School logo In 1924, the first graduation ceremony was held. During this ceremony, Dominador Arcinas was proclaimed Valedictorian and Pablo Nangit as the Salutatorian. They are considered as the best in their class of 1924. In 1936, Governor Heginio Mendoza made a directive on the transfer of the Palawan High School from the island municipality of Cuyo to the Municipality of Puerto Princesa, in the center of the province. The PHS temporarily used the old buildings of the Puerto Princesa Elementary School. Two years later, they added new classes to their curriculum, including Retail Merchandising, Horticulture, Woodworking, Sheet Metal Work, Poultry, Swine and Automotive. When World War Two broke out, the school was temporarily closed. It was reopened during the liberation of the Philippines, in early 1945. During this time, Palawan High School was moved and temporarily housed in the recreation hall of Iwahig Penal Colony. After the liberation concluded, it was returned to the town of Puerto Princesa. In 1947, it was transferred again, but to its now permanent place ‚Äì a 9 hectare plot of land located at what is now known as Higenio Mendoza Sr. Street. At their new land, they constructed their first building ‚Äì their main building. During the move, there were Quonset huts from the American Forces which was transferred during the time of former Governor of Palawan Alfredo M. Abueg, Sr.. As the years passed, due to the increase in the school population, new prefabricated buildings were constructed and replaced the old Quonset Huts from the American Forces. In the year 1957, the General Curriculum used by the school was changed to a General 2‚Äì2 plan. Under this curriculum, students were permitted to choose their subjects. Students can take an academic course in preparation for the college course or they can take course intended only for vocational courses such as Retail Merchandising, Agriculture, Woodworking and Home Technology, when they reach their third year in high school. In 1965, it was converted to a National High School under the principalship of Mr. Eugenio J. Dela Cuesta and was renamed to Palawan National High School. During his time as the principal of Palawan National High School, Eugenio J. Dela Cuesta ordered new buildings to be constructed. This included the Science Complex, the roofed concrete stage, the Gaudencio Abordo Multi-purpose Center and the Athletic Complex. The latter is composed of 2 grandstand, concrete bleacher, control tower, swimming pool, a tennis court, volleyball and basketball court, and other facilities. In 1969, the Palawan National High School hosted the Southern Tagalog Athletic Association (STRAA) Meet. In 1975, Due to economic crises, many of the students served as working students to sustain their studies. For this reason, Palawan National High School opened evening classes to accommodate those students who are working during day time and studying at night. There were only 132 students when evening classes were opened but later on there were an increase in their number. In 1989, the Republic Act 6765, sponsored by the late Speaker of the House of Representatives ,Speaker Ramon V. Mitra, and the former representative of second district of Palawan, Congressman David A. Ponce De Leon was passed. Under this law, schools on other parts of the Province of Palawan were integrated into one big school. These schools were Palawan National School, Puerto Princesa City School for Philippine Crafstmen, San Jose Barangay High School, Inagawan Barangay High School, Puerto Princesa Rural High School, Plaridel Barangay High School in the municipality of Aborlan, Palawan, Narra Barangay High School in Naraa, Palawan, Pulot Barangay High School in Brooke‚Äôs Point, Palawan, Bataraza High School in Bataraza, Palawan, and Balabac Barangay High School in Balabac, Palawan. According to the law, all schools included shall be called Palawan Integrated National Schools or PINS. Today, Palawan National School is still catering to the education of all Palawe√±os, with the mission of continuous development of those who can contribute and can help not only the Province of Palawan likewise the country as a whole.  Mission and Vision   Mission  A PNS that delivers quality education (formal, non-formal, informal) adoptable to the present environment manned by competent and committed teachers and personnel with the cooperation and understanding of parents and local and national officials and non-governmental organizations.  Vision  The PALAWAN NATIONAL SCHOOL envisions every high school learner to be God‚Äìloving through experiencing wholesome atmosphere that develops them to be intellectually, morally, and physically prepared to the fast changing environments suited to maintain the needed ecological balance.

Pablo Hurus (also Paul Hurus, Paul Hyrus, Paul Huros, Paulus de Constantia, born in Constance; died after 1505) was a German printer of the late 15th-century, active in Zaragoza, Aragon during the years 1484 to 1499. With his brother Juan, he established one of the important early printing shops of the Iberian peninsula, predated only by the Sevilla printing shops of Menrad Ungut and Estanislao Polono. In 1484, he printed the Evangelios e ep√≠stolas by the Zaragozan humanist Gonzalo Garc√≠a de Santamar√≠a, which included the first printed Bible translation into Spanish. No specimen of this work has survived, as it was ordered to be destroyed by the Spanish Inquisition after the ban on Bible translations issued in 1559 (the work does however survive in the reprint by Ambrosio Montesino, Toledo, 1512). Between 1488 and 1491, Pablo Hurus returned to his native Germany, and the printing shop was under the direction of his brother Juan.

In 1497, he printed the Aragonese fueros (compilation of laws), edited by Gonzalo Garc√≠a de Santamar√≠a, and the letters of Seneca, edited by Fern√°n P√©rez de Guzm√°n. His masterpiece may be Bernhard of Breidenbach's Peregrinatio in terram sanctam of 1498, using three different blackletter types and more than seventy woodcut illustrations, decorative capital initials and eight great fold-out pages, one of them extending to the width of nine folia. In 1499, he printed the first history of Aragon, Cr√≥nica de Arag√≥n by Gualberto Fabricio Vagad, with the first known representation of the coat of arms of Aragon on the title page.

Skirving was President of the Queensland Industrial Council from 1914 to 1916 and, representing the seat of Maree, an alderman with the Brisbane City Council for four years from 1931. Political career When the Labour Party starting forming governments in Queensland, it found much of its legislation being blocked by a hostile Council, where members had been appointed for life by successive conservative governments. After a failed referendum in May 1917, Premier Ryan tried a new tactic, and later that year advised the Governor, Sir Hamilton John Goold-Adams, to appoint thirteen new members whose allegiance lay with Labour to the Council.Goold-Adams, Sir Hamilton John (1858‚Äì1920) ‚Äì Australian Dictionary of Biography.

Punjabi: Still the Top Choice  The Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC) had been exhorting the CSS aspirants to choose regional languages as an optional subject by awarding marks beyond their expectations. But, after the recent regrouping of subjects and revision of syllabi students are in a quandary about their supportiveness. The situation becomes even more perplexing when we see that the regional languages and other scoring subjects like Psychology, Geography, Sociology, Arabic, Persian and Journalism, have been consigned to the same group. Nevertheless, regional languages are still pregnant with opportunities to secure excellent marks. Punjabi is one of the very few subjects that have never disappointed the CSS aspirants. An average student with an average preparation could score 55 to 65 marks while those having a strong grip over it could easily get more than 75 marks.

Her albums came out in the 1990s with Atlanta International Records, with The Great Reunion, being their only release to chart on the Billboard magazine Gospel Albums chart. Early life Sister Lucille Pope was born on January 12, 1936 in Concord, Georgia as Lucille Hall, where she was the youngest child in the family of eight siblings. The Pearly Gates were formed in the 1960s by her and two of her brothers and a brother-in-law. The first iteration included her husband, Willie Pope, yet he died before they joined Nashboro Records in 1975, so her second husband, Louis Alexander, became part of the group. Music career Their first recording was distributed locally in 1964, \\"Almighty God\\" with Lucille Pope as the lead singer, and a second single, \\"Early One Morning\\" with Larry Bivins in the leading role. This would get national exposure, when Vee-Jay Records put the songs out nationally. They would release a single with Chess Records in 1965, \\"Jesus Tore My Heart to Pieces\\", which was successful at radio. Nashboro Records would sign them in 1975, and release \\"Somebody's Gone\\", which was a ballad, yet the label would shortly be defunct. So, they picked up the pieces and joined Atlanta International Records in 1982. This would be the label that would release six albums from the group, with one of them charting, The Great Reunion, which was released on May 22, 1990.

Early life Synot was born in Essendon, Victoria to parents Donna and Paul. He is the 3rd eldest of 3 boys and 3 girls. Synot was born with a rare condition known as Osteogenesis Imperfecta or Brittle Bones Disease (Type IV), which meant he was prone to bone fractures from a young age. In his early years of life, preventative surgeries were undertaken to limit severity and frequency of fractures; particularly in his right femur. He has 2 siblings who also suffer from the rare bone condition. Education Synot attended Greenvale Primary School from 1994 ‚Äì 2000 and completed his Victorian Certificate of Education at Penola Catholic College from 2001 ‚Äì 2006. He was taught P.E by former Richmond and West Coast AFL/VFL player Richard Geary. In 2010, he achieved an undergraduate degree in Health Science at Monash University. In 2014, he completed a graduate diploma in Middle Years Education at the Queensland University of Technology. Wheelchair Tennis Synot started his sporting career as a junior wheelchair tennis player at Kingsville Tennis Club, 10 minutes west of Melbourne‚Äôs CBD. He was a consistent performer achieving semi final placings at the Bendigo Open in 2001 and 2002. Synot competed in the junior doubles at the 2001 Australian Open where he was partnered with longtime friend and Australian Tennis representative Ben Beare to reach the final. Beare and Synot were defeated in the final by Heath Davidson and 2015 Australian Wheelchair Open Quad Singles Champion Dylan Alcott in a 3rd-set tiebreaker. Wheelchair Basketball: Playing career Synot took a break until 2007 to focus on school and university before a chance interaction with former doubles partner Ben Beare led him back into sport. Synot played wheelchair basketball for 9 months before being selected to play for Victoria at the 2007 Junior Nationals, held in Narrabeen, New South Wales. He would go on to play a consistent tournament before breaking his arm in the semi final against Western Australia. Victoria would go on to win the game before losing in the final to tournament favourites ‚Äì New South Wales. Synot was named to play for Australia in the junior representative game against the USA. Synot made the jump in 2008 to play in the NWBL competition with the Dandenong Rangers. Dandenong would go on to finish 4th that season with Synot playing every game. In 2009, Synot played few minutes for the entirety of the season due to inconsistent form and a deep roster. Synot narrowly missed out on a spot in the U23‚Äôs Australian Team who competed in the 2009 U23 IWBF World Championships. The team would go on to finish fourth in Paris, France. In 2010, Synot under new coach Brett Paxton had an impact at times coming off the bench in a mid pointer rotation. Dandenong would achieve a third placing in the league that season. Driven by narrow misses and lack of opportunities, Synot worked hard and forged a spot in the team for the 2011 season. His first 4 games showed improvement averaging 7.5 ppg, 3.3 apg and 1.2 rpg. Synot was also awarded with an MVP at the Albury Wodonga State Tournament and was a member of the All Star 5 in the Basketball Australia Frank Ponta Cup. In June 2011, Synot broke his right femur, which sidelined him for the rest of the season. In 2012, Synot would make the switch to the RSL Queensland Brisbane Bullets. He would go on to have a serviceable year averaging 4 points per 11 minutes game time throughout the season. Synot announced his retirement at the end of the 2012 season, citing injury as the reason. Coaching career: NWBL Synot received an offer to become the assistant coach of the Queensland Juniors Wheelchair Basketball Team in 2013. He was promoted mid year with a role as technical coach across the Queensland National League Program. The RSL Queensland Spinning Bullets would go on to finish 3rd in that season. In 2014, Synot was offered the opportunity to coach the RSL Queensland Spinning Bullets. RSL Queensland Spinning Bullets finished 2nd in the regular season and advanced through to the Championship game defeating home side Perth Wheelcats by 3 points. Perth Wheelcats would go on to make the final through a semi final and reverse the results on the Sunday and be crowned Champions for the 2014. This was the third time the RSL Queensland Spinning Bullets were runners up in the NWBL competition history. Synot was awarded Coach of the Year in the NWBL for the 2014 season in his rookie year. International coaching In November 2014, Synot was selected by Australian Coach Ben Ettridge as a development coach to tour Kitakyushu, Japan where the team would claim 3rd place in the competition. Personal Synot is an avid golfer and is prominent supporter of the North Melbourne Football Club in the AFL. He also has strong ties to horse racing through childhood friend and ex Melbourne Cup winning jockey, Greg Hall Synot is currently vice-president of not-for- profit organisation Sporting Wheelies and Disabled Association.

Its decussate leaf arrangement and its small heads of white flowers on the sides of its branches are diagnostic. This is probably the least spectacular of all the melaleucas. Description Melaleuca pauciflora is a bushy shrub usually growing to a height of about . Its leaves are in alternate pairs, the pairs at right angles to the ones above and below so that there are four rows of leaves along the stems. The leaves are long and wide, glabrous and elliptic in shape but tapering towards the end. The flowers are white, in small heads up to in diameter and contain 2 to 8 flowers. The petals are long and fall off as the flowers mature. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle with 2 to 7 stamens. Flowers appear in summer and are followed by fruit which are woody capsules . Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca pauciflora was first formally described in 1847 by Nikolai Turczaninow in \\"Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Imp√©riale des Naturalistes de Moscou\\". The specific epithet (pauciflora) is from the Latin words paucus meaning \\"few\\" or \\"little\\" and flos meaning \\"flower\\" or \\"blossom\\" referring to the inflorescences which are small and have few flowers. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca pauciflora occurs between the Perth area and Albany in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren biogeographic regions. It grows in sand in estuaries, swamps and other winter-wet areas.

A language workbench will typically include tools to support the definition, reuse and composition of domain-specific languages together with their integrated development environment. Language workbenches were introduced and popularized by Martin Fowler in 2005. Language workbenches usually support: * Specification of the language concepts or metamodel * Specification of the editing environments for the domain-specific language * Specification of the execution semantics, e.g. through interpretation and code generation Examples * Racket is a cross platform language development workbench including compiler, JIT compiler, IDE and command line tools designed to accommodate creating both domain-specific languages and completely new languages with facilities to add new notation, constrain constructs, and create IDE tools. * JetBrains MPS is a tool for designing domain-specific languages. It uses projectional editing which allows overcoming the limits of language parsers, and building DSL editors, such as ones with tables and diagrams. It implements language-oriented programming. MPS combines an environment for language definition, a language workbench, and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for such languages. * Kermeta is an open-source academic language workbench. The Kermeta workbench uses three different meta- languages: one meta-language for the abstract syntax (aligned with Emof); one for the static semantics (aligned with OCL) and one for the behavioral semantics (called the Kermeta Language itself). * Melange is a language workbench that provides a modular approach for customizing, assembling and integrating multiple domain-specific language (DSL) specifications and implementations. * Spoofax is an open-source language workbench for generating parsers, type checkers, compilers, interpreters, as well as IDE plugins for Eclipse and IntelliJ.

Usually this period of the year does not get rain but this year heavy rainfall destroyed most of the winter harvest that was near to being cut. It directly affected normal life, especially of farmers who lost their harvest for this season. Because of the crop damage on a large scale, increases in the prices of basic food items occurred. Approximately 106 lakh hectares harvest was damaged and 80 farmers attempted suicide in March alone. It is recorded as the wettest March in 48 years. Impact ‚ÄúUsually, from February, western disturbances tend to subside. But this year, not only were the disturbances more active, they extended up to April. Also, there was an induced low pressure, which pulled moisture both from the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. This led to heavy and frequent showers in March In March, 62.5 millimetres of rainfall were recorded, almost 100 per cent more than normal (32.1 millimetres) and the highest in the past 100 years (in 1915, it was 78 millimetres). The showers and hail, which came at a time when the rabi crop was to be harvested, hit about 10 million hectares of the 60 million hectares of sown area. The standing wheat, mustard and chana crops were hit the hardest. Wheat crop in 21 per cent of the overall sown area has been completely damaged. The estimated loss to an average farmer affected by rains has been Rs 20,000 per acre but the government has announced a relief of just Rs 6,800 per hectare for rain fed areas.\\" Affected states and crops {  - !

There are a very limited number of port numbers, which are assigned by IANA for protocols recognized as viable, complying with current protocol design standards, and not already covered by existing Internet standards. For example, port 25 was assigned to the SMTP email protocol many years ago. This establishes a standard and eliminates conflicts with other protocols. The technical review of IRP was performed by Lars Eggert, the distinguished chair of the Internet Research Task Force. IRP was created by Lawrence E. Hughes, co-founder and CTO of Sixscape Communications, to allow applications to register their name, email address, UserID, their current IPv6 address and other information with the company's Domain Identity Registry server. IRP also supports all functions of a Public Key Infrastructure and an authenticated Address Registry. Sixscape's Domain Identity Registry server issues and manages X.509 client digital certificates for authentication and secure messaging. The Address Registry feature enables a new connectivity paradigm, called End2End Direct, in which user applications can connect directly to each other rather than via intermediary servers as is common with Client/Server architecture applications common on the older IPv4 Internet. IRP is a streaming network protocol (TCP based, connection oriented). It is a Client/Server design with clearly defined server and client roles and implementations. It is secured with TLS v1.2 using the latest, strongest ciphersuites (e.g. Diffie Hellman Ephemeral for key exchange, AES256 for symmetric encryption and SHA2/384 for message digest). It does server to client authentication using an X.509 Server certificate, similar to web or email servers. It normally does client to server authentication with X.509 client certificates (usually obtained via IRP), with fallback to Username/Password Authentication (UPA) if needed. UPA can be disabled on a per-user basis. IRP protocol messages are valid XML documents.

The assignment was issued by IANA on 11 September 2014, and is listed in the official IANA resource registry at http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers There are a very limited number of port numbers, which are assigned by IANA for protocols recognized as viable, complying with current protocol design standards, and not already covered by existing Internet standards. For example, port 25 was assigned to the SMTP email protocol many years ago. This provides a standard port and reduces conflicts with other protocols. The technical review of the SixChat protocol was performed by Lars Eggert, the distinguished chair of the Internet Research Task Force. The SixChat messaging protocol was created by Lawrence E. Hughes, co-founder and CTO of Sixscape Communications, for their SixChat Internet application software. The new protocol allows two SixChat User Agents to connect directly, perform mutual authentication with X.509 client digital certificates and then securely exchange a symmetric session key (for encryption of all content). SixChat uses the company‚Äôs Identity Registration Protocol (IANA assigned port 4604) for address registry and retrieval, as well as Public Key Infrastructure functions (to obtain and use client digital certificates). End2End Direct messaging requires globally routable (\\"public\\") IP addresses for all nodes involved. It is incompatible with NAT (Network Address Translation). It can work within a private internet (a subset of the IPv4 Internet that uses a flat address space with no NAT), or between any two nodes on the public IPv6 Internet. NAT prevents incoming connections, so any user to user messaging must use intermediary servers. End2End Direct Messaging has several advantages over indirect messaging via intermediary servers. End2End Direct traffic is highly decentralized, going only via the shortest network path between communicating parties. This makes it more difficult to intercept, monitor or block. Intermediary servers introduce reliability, salability and security issues. It is much easier to monitor or block network traffic that must go through a small number of \\"choke points\\". It would be possible to use DNS for nodename resolution (mapping nodenames to IP addresses) for End2End Direct messaging, but DNS is increasingly insecure, has no per-user authentication for registration or updating, and takes a long time to propagate. It has no good way to publish X.509 client digital certificates for users, and can only publish the address of a given network node, not the node most recently used by a particular person. IRP provides a highly secure address registry with per-user authentication (usually using X.509 certificate based Strong Client Authentication). Registered information is immediately available. IP addresses of highly mobile nodes (e.g. smart phones) may change frequently as the connect to different WiFi access points. This does not work well in the DNS model. The SixChat End2End Messaging protocol is a streaming protocol (tcp based, connection oriented). It cannot be secured with TLS, which is an inherently Client/Server technology. It provides mutual strong authentication using only X.509 client digital certificates (no server cert involved), and symmetric session key exchange (via public/private key encryption or Ephemeral Diffie Hellman Key Exchange). This handshake is based on the design of TLS, but is not Client/Server, rather between peers. Unlike TLS, it lies entirely within the Application Layer the protocol messages are based on XML. Nodes supporting End2End Direct messaging are neither client nor server, but must be able to originate and accept network connections (hence have characteristics of both clients and servers). Such a node is called a \\"User Agent\\".

The mill was operated commercially until the 1940s and has since been refurbished as part of Sloan Park run by Rowan County. The mill and surrounding property are operated by Rowan County as Sloan Park. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

The Kerr Mill was constructed by Joseph Kerr in 1823 on his 1,500 plantation, called Oakland, between Sills and Cathey's Creeks in Rowan County, North Carolina. After Joseph's death, the mill was run by his son, Dr. Samuel Kerr. Samuel Kerr was destroyed financially by the U.S. Civil War. After the war the mill was operated on a small scale from 18651872 for local tenant farmers. The mill and Kerr plantation were purchased by James Samuel McCubbins in 1872. The mill was then run using an undershot wheel fed by a long mill race and canal. In 1887 the mill was upgrade to a roller mill powered by a steam engine. The mill was purchased by John W. Page in 1895, Pleasant Owen Tatum in 1900, and James Wiseman Sloan in 1908. The mill was converted to run with a Bessemer diesel engine in 1925. The mill was sold to James W.

Israeli breakthrough ‚Äì Crossing the canal After the Egyptian failed attack of October 14, the Israelis immediately followed with a multidivisional counterattack through the gap between the Egyptian 2nd and 3rd Armies. Ariel Sharon's 143rd Division, now reinforced with the 247th paratroopers reserve Brigade commanded by Colonel Danny Matt, was tasked with establishing bridgeheads on the east and west banks of the canal. The 162nd and 252nd Armored Divisions, commanded by Generals Avraham Adan and Kalman Magen respectively, would then cross through the breach to the west bank of the canal and swing southward, encircling the 3rd Army. The offensive was code-named Operation Stouthearted Men or alternatively, Operation Valiant. On the night of October 15, 750 of Colonel Matt's paratroopers crossed the canal in rubber dinghies. They were soon joined by tanks ferried on motorized rafts and additional infantry. The force encountered no resistance initially and fanned out in raiding parties, attacking supply convoys, SAM sites, logistic centers and anything of military value, with priority given to the SAMs. Attacks on SAM sites punched a hole in the Egyptian anti-aircraft screen and enabled the Israeli Air Force to strike Egyptian ground targets more aggressively.Gal Perl Finkel, The combat ethos is alive and well, Israel Hayom, July 31, 2014. On the night of October 15, 20 Israeli tanks and 7 APCs under the command of Colonel Haim Erez crossed the canal and penetrated 12 kilometres into mainland Egypt, taking the Egyptians by surprise. For the first 24 hours, Erez's force attacked SAM sites and military columns with impunity. On the morning of October 17, it was attacked by the 23rd Egyptian Armored Brigade, but managed to repulse the attack. By this time, the Syrians no longer posed a credible threat and the Israelis were able to shift their air power to the south in support of the offensive. The combination of a weakened Egyptian SAM umbrella and a greater concentration of Israeli fighter- bombers meant that the IAF was capable of greatly increasing sorties against Egyptian military targets, including convoys, armor and airfields. The Egyptian bridges across the canal were damaged in Israeli air and artillery attacks. Israeli jets began attacking Egyptian SAM sites and radars, prompting General Ismail to withdraw much of the Egyptians' air defense equipment. This in turn gave the IAF still greater freedom to operate in Egyptian airspace. Israeli jets also attacked and destroyed underground communication cables at Banha in the Nile Delta, forcing the Egyptians to transmit selective messages by radio, which could be intercepted. Aside from the cables at Banha, Israel refrained from attacking economic and strategic infrastructure following an Egyptian threat to retaliate against Israeli cities with Scud missiles. Israeli aircraft bombed Egyptian Scud batteries at Port Said several times. The Egyptian Air Force attempted to interdict IAF sorties and attack Israeli ground forces, but suffered heavy losses in dogfights and from Israeli air defenses, while inflicting light aircraft losses on the Israelis. The heaviest air battles took place over the northern Nile Delta, where the Israelis repeatedly attempted to destroy Egyptian airbases. Securing the bridgehead Despite the success the Israelis were having on the west bank, Generals Bar- Lev and Elazar ordered Sharon to concentrate on securing the bridgehead on the east bank. He was ordered to clear the roads leading to the canal as well as a position known as the Chinese Farm, just north of Deversoir, the Israeli crossing point. Sharon objected and requested permission to expand and breakout of the bridgehead on the west bank, arguing that such a maneuver would cause the collapse of Egyptian forces on the east bank. But the Israeli high command was insistent, believing that until the east bank was secure, forces on the west bank could be cut off. Sharon was overruled by his superiors and relented. On October 16, he dispatched Amnon Reshef's Brigade to attack the Chinese Farm. Other IDF forces attacked entrenched Egyptian forces overlooking the roads to the canal. After three days of bitter and close- quarters fighting, the Israelis succeeded in dislodging the numerically superior Egyptian forces. The Israelis lost about 300 dead, 1,000 wounded, and 56 tanks. The Egyptians suffered heavier casualties, including 118 tanks destroyed and 15 captured. Egyptian response to the Israeli crossing The Egyptians meanwhile failed to grasp the extent and magnitude of the Israeli crossing, nor did they appreciate its intent and purpose. This was partly due to attempts by Egyptian field commanders to obfuscate reports concerning the Israeli crossing and partly due to a false assumption that the canal crossing was merely a diversion for a major IDF offensive targeting the right flank of the Second Army. Consequently, on October 16, General Shazly ordered the 21st Armored Division to attack southward and the T-62-equipped 25th Independent Armored Brigade to attack northward in a pincer action to eliminate the perceived threat to the Second Army. The Egyptians failed to scout the area and were unaware that by now, Adan's 162nd Armored Division was in the vicinity. Moreover, the 21st and 25th failed to coordinate their attacks, allowing General Adan's Division to meet each force individually. Adan first concentrated his attack on the 21st Armored Division, destroying 50‚Äì60 Egyptian tanks and forcing the remainder to retreat. He then turned southward and ambushed the 25th Independent Armored Brigade, destroying 86 of its 96 tanks and all of its APCs while losing three tanks. Egyptian artillery shelled the Israeli bridge over the canal on the morning of October 17, scoring several hits. The Egyptian Air Force launched repeated raids, some with up to twenty aircraft, to take out the bridge and rafts, damaging the bridge. The Egyptians had to shut down their SAM sites during these raids, allowing Israeli fighters to intercept the Egyptians. The Egyptians lost 16 planes and 7 helicopters, while the Israelis lost 6 planes. The bridge was damaged, and the Israeli Paratroop Headquarters, which was near the bridge, was also hit, wounding the commander and his deputy. During the night, the bridge was repaired, but only a trickle of Israeli forces crossed. According to Chaim Herzog, the Egyptians continued attacking the bridgehead until the cease-fire, using artillery and mortars to fire tens of thousands of shells into the area of the crossing. Egyptian aircraft attempted to bomb the bridge every day, and helicopters launched suicide missions, making attempts to drop barrels of napalm on the bridge and bridgehead. The bridges were damaged multiple times, and had to be repaired at night. The attacks caused heavy casualties, and many tanks were sunk when their rafts were hit. Egyptian commandos and frogmen with armored support launched a ground attack against the bridgehead, which was repulsed with the loss of 10 tanks. Two subsequent Egyptian counterattacks were also beaten back. After the failure of the October 17 counterattacks, the Egyptian General Staff slowly began to realize the magnitude of the Israeli offensive. Early on October 18, the Soviets showed Sadat satellite imagery of Israeli forces operating on the west bank. Alarmed, Sadat dispatched Shazly to the front to assess the situation first hand. He no longer trusted his field commanders to provide accurate reports. Shazly confirmed that the Israelis had at least one division on the west bank and were widening their bridgehead. He advocated withdrawing most of Egypt's armor from the east bank to confront the growing Israeli threat on the west bank. Sadat rejected this recommendation outright and even threatened Shazly with a court martial. Ahmad Ismail Ali recommended that Sadat push for a cease-fire so as to prevent the Israelis from exploiting their successes.

Additionally, every year - besides the regular various language courses, there is always a broad offer of cultural events all students of the Sprachenatelier can join.  Building  Space inside the House Garbe-today Oskar Garbe, a master mason from Lichtenberg, Berlin, was a successful property developer around 1900. In Berlin he built the Erl√∂serkirche in Berlin (Church of the Redeemer) and the Samariterkirche (Samariter Church), various commercial buildings, a cabaret theatre and several luxury villas. In 1907 he built a prestigious residential building at 40 Frankfurter Allee, which is where the Sprachenatelier can be found today. The architect Hans Liepe developed the building's plans in 1906 for Mr Garbe, who himself designed the layout of the apartments and then lived on the second floor in a nine room apartment. Jugendstil salon in Sprachenatelier Berlin (House Garbe) The five-storey, red stucco-fronted building has a double-arched gable and a four sided central bay on the second and third floors with balcony. In the courtyard there is a five- storey, white klinkered industrial building with a further courtyard. The frontal facade was designed in an art nouveau style and is decorated with blue bricks. Users of the building until 1900 were principally furniture makers and shops. The complex is listed. Of particular interest are the rich, almost completely retained interior fittings in art nouveau style.

Biography After studying with Luigi Pareyson, Ugo Perone graduated in philosophy at the University of Turin with a thesis on \\"Charles Secr√©tan‚Äôs Philosophy of Freedom.\\" The thesis received the Luisa Guzzo Award for the best philosophy dissertation discussed during that academic year. Perone has been Professor of Theoretical Philosophy and of Moral Philosophy at the University of Turin, the University of Rome \\"Tor Vergata\\", and the University of Eastern Piedmont in Vercelli, where he has also been Chair of the Department of Humanistic Studies and Associate Provost for International Relations. Since 2012, Perone has been Guardini Professur f√ºr Religionsphilosophie und Katholische Weltanschauung at the Humboldt- Universit√§t in Berlin. From 1993 to 2001 Ugo Perone was Councillor for Culture for the town of Turin, and from 2009 to 2013 Councillor for Culture for the Province of Turin. In 2001 he was appointed Director of the Italian Cultural Institute in Berlin, position which he held until 2003. He is Senior Fellow of the Collegium Budapest. He is also the President of the Italian Society for Philosophical and Theological Studies and a member of the Executive Committee of the journal Filosofia e Teologia. He is a member of the editorial boards for Giornale di Metafisica, Spazio Filosofico, and the Luigi Pareyson Center for Philosophical-Religious Studies. He is the founder and Director of the Scuola di Alta Formazione Filosofica (School for Higher Philosophical Education), which was established through collaboration with the Compagnia di San Paolo foundation and the Luigi Pareyson Center for Philosophical Religious Studies. Ugo Perone has delivered lectures at major Italian universities and also in Chicago, Washington, Albany (NY), Frankfurt, Berlin, Munich, Erlangen, Essen, Cologne, Freiburg, Budapest, Strasbourg, Paris, Brussels, Mexico, and Senegal. His ability to teach and orient his students on the path of philosophical research cannot be disjointed from his way of practicing philosophy. Philosophy Recent works are devoted to deepening the possible political dimension of a hermeneutic philosophy (politics is the invention of a new order that considers \\"for me\\" and \\"for all\\" at the same time); to the rediscovery of a creative morality capable of bringing ethics to a more comprehensive and inclusive normativity beyond itself; the themes of the philosophy of religion, with a renewed discussion of the meaning of secularization; the richness and complexity of truth, which cannot be reduced to mere correspondence, but also includes responsibility for the real. Ugo Perone's entire philosophical path is inspired by a metaphor, namely, Jacob's struggle with the angel as it is narrated in the book of Genesis.Ugo Perone, Modernit√† e memoria, pp. IX-XI. In the desert night, a stranger interrupts Jacob‚Äôs solitude and struggles with him in a fight that will see neither winners nor losers. Only, at dawn, Jacob discovers that he has been wound by the angel. The wound also signifies the blessing of a new name: Jacob, the one who has struggled with God and has not been killed, from now on will be named Israel.Genesis 32:28-29. The tale is the cypher of the extreme tension that, according to Perone, is in place between finite and infinite, penultimate and ultimate,Ugo Perone, Storia e ontologia, p. 81. individual meanings and overall sense.Perone, Modernit√† e memoria, p. 129. Philosophy has a moral obligation to remain faithful to the finite. This faithfulness leads philosophy never to dismiss the historical conditions of thinking but also never to give up its own vocation to transcend such conditions by listening to the non-immediate, work, and labor. Once it has recognized modernity as its own condition, thinking cannot delude itself into believing that it can find its own position within being or sense, as if no break had occurred between finite and infinite. A flattening of thinking onto merely historical meanings, as if thinking were oblivious to the call of being, would be equally inopportune though. The necessary protection of the finite (a protection of the finite that must be exercised when necessary also against being, which must be challenged because toward that which is strong one can only be strong in turn) cannot amount to the elimination of either of the two opponents. On the threshold between finite and infinite, between history and ontology, a mediation occurs‚Äîthis does not imply the reduction but rather the preservation of the distance between the two dimensions. In order to preserve the double excess of the finite over the infinite and of the infinite over the finite, one is not allowed to erase the distance between the two by either transforming it into unity or weakening it to the point of indifference. It is true, for example, that memory can only preserve fragments and cannot claim direct remembrance of the whole. Yet it is also true that fragments should not be abandoned to a nihilistic drift because what is contained within each fragment (which memory remembers) is not a mere instant but precisely the essential (of a life, of a story, ‚Ä¶) that must therefore be remembered.Modernit√† e memoria, p. 133. Philosophy is obsessed with the whole, yet such a whole ‚Äúextends not to totality but rather to the intensity of the fragment in which the whole is at stake.‚ÄùUgo Perone, La verit√† del sentimento, p. 174. It becomes thus clear why Perone‚Äôs first books have double words in their titles: Modernit√† e memoria [Modernity and Memory], Storia e ontologia [History and Ontology]. The issue is that of saying two things at the same time according to the dialectics of the et-et, a dialectics of lingering and anticipation. The later books on the contrary identify a single theme ever since the title: Le passioni del finito [The Passions of the Finite], Nonostante il soggetto [Despite the Subject], Il presente possible The Possible Present, La verit√† del sentimento [The Truth of the Sentiment]. This unicity indicates that the finite, the subject, the present, the sentiment are investigated as thresholds, as places that cannot be conceived, let alone lived, without memory of the other. As it is the case for Jacob, these places carry upon themselves as a blessing the wound inflicted by the other. Method of work Perone develops his philosophy hermeneutically, on the ground of a deep investigation‚Äîwhich often goes against what is trendy at the time‚Äîinto the history of philosophy and specific classic and contemporary authors such as Descartes, Schiller, Feuerbach, Secr√©tan, Benjamin in addition to various other philosophers (specifically, Plato, Aristotle, Hegel, Schelling, Kierkegaard, Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and Levinas) whose names constellate Perone's numerous works. An integral part of Perone's philosophical research is the continuous confrontation with theology, especially the theological thinking of Barth, Bonhoeffer, Bultmann, and Guardini. In recent years, Perone's attention has extended to a consideration of poetry (especially Paul Celan's), narration, and theater, understood as areas capable of offering crucial philosophical contributions.

The BJH is a peer-reviewed medical journal that has been in publication since 1955. The Journal publishes original research papers in clinical, laboratory and experimental haematology, helping clinicians and staff in the field keep up to date with the latest recommendations, developments, and protocols. Full members of the BSH receive copies of the BJH along with access to the journal online. EJHaem - Open Access Journal The BSH has launched an Open Access Journal, EJHaem with Professor Andrew M Evens appointed as Editor-in-chief. This is the society's second official journal and is co-owned and published by Wiley. This Gold Open Access journal aims to provide an additional home for those wishing to publish haematology research on an Open Access basis. The EJHaem accepts direct submissions, as well as content cascaded from the British Journal of Haematology. Guidelines The British Society for Haematology produces its guidelines. These guidelines are written by expert consultants and clinical scientists currently practising in the UK. The guidelines provide up-to-date evidence-based guidance on the diagnosis and treatment of haematological diseases. They provide three different styles of guidelines: BSH Guideline: Evidence-based guidelines developed following a professional literature search and a review of the evidence by the writing group. BSH Good Practice Paper: Used to recommend good practice in areas where there is a less robust evidence base but for which a degree of consensus or uniformity is likely to be beneficial to patient care. BSH Position Paper: The adoption and adaptation of a non-UK evidence-based guideline for use in the UK. BSH Events Annual Scientific Meeting Every year the BSH holds an annual scientific meeting(ASM) at different locations within the United Kingdom. The most recent ASM in 2019, was held at the Scottish Event Campus(SEC) in Glasgow. This years‚Äô ASM, will be held at the International Convention Centre(ICC), Birmingham from 27‚Äì29 April. The meetings usually host internationally renowned expert speakers, a plethora of sessions discussing specialist topics and innovative debates. In addition to this, there is a call for abstracts from haematology professionals in which they apply to present their research at the meeting. Other Events The BSH also frequently hosts a variety of courses and events. These courses and events are organized for special interest groups and trainee haematology students and professionals. They permit the professional development of attendees and also provide a platform for discussion and networking opportunities. BSH Grants The BSH provides grants to supports hundreds of haematology professionals to attend international conferences, undertake research and advance haematology education. There are grants provided for members only ‚Äì open to members after one year of membership. These grants include meeting support grants, cohort study grants (open to members are 3 years of membership), Early-stage research start-up grants and visiting fellow grants.

The building holds a special significance in being the Death place of Sister Nivedita, the disciple of Swami Vivekananda who died on 13 October 1911.  History of Roy Villa  Roy Villa before Restoration Darjeeling view from Roy Villa This European castle-like structure is around 115 years old and is named after its original owner, Dwarakanath Roy. He was the brother of Mr. P. K. Roy, the first ever Principal of the Presidency College. Famous scientist & botanist Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose rented this premises from his friend, Dwarakanath Roy due to its weather and ambience in summer. Later, when Sister Nivedita‚Äôs health was deteriorating, he & Lady Abala Bose invited Sister Nivedita to stay in this house. Sister Nivedita liked this place due to the soothing weather and started to live discreetly with them. Apart from Mr. & Mrs. Bose, famous Doctor Nil Ratan Sarkar and scientist Basiswar Sen were also present in the Roy Villa when Sister Nivedita died in 1911. From 1903 to 1911, Sister Nivedita stayed at Darjeeling for around 242 days in 7 different visits. {  - ! Duration of Sister Nivedita's stay in Roy villa !!

Total !! 242 }  Later Stage  For several years, Roy Villa was abandoned until The Himalayan Mountaineering Institute took the place as its starting operation in 1954 when it was inaugurated by the then prime minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Initially there were 20 students who were taught in the Roy Villa but once the number of students increased, The Himalayan Mountaineering Institute shifted its base to the Western Spur of Birch Hill on 25 December 1957. For several years, Roy Villa was under the Youth Services Department of Govt. of West Bengal and then to the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) before it was finally handed over to the Ramakrishna Mission.  New Life of Roy Villa  After a series of discussion between GTA & State Government with the presence of Association for Conservation and Tourism, the Siliguri-based NGO who proposed to make Roy Villa a heritage site and Ramakrishna Mission, it has been decided that Roy Villa will be handed over. Mamata Banerjee handed over the Roy Villa to the Ramakrishna Mission in presence of Swami Suhitanandaji, General Secretary of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, Belur Math on 16 May 2013. Finally the key of the Roy Villa was handed over to Secretary of Ramakrishna Mission Nivedita Educational and Cultural Centre, a branch centre of Ramakrishna Mission, Belur Math on 10 July 2013, the auspicious day of Ratha Jatra by Sri Gautam Deb, Minister In - charge of North Bengal Development Department. State Government has sanctioned Rs. 1 crore for its restoration and its Information & Cultural Department will look after the heritage building.  Present Status  Newly revamped & restored Roy Villa is now under the control of Ramakrishna Mission and they have taken a series of projects to run from this premises. Her picture, old writing desk, chair, table lamp stand, wall clock, typewriter, the old styled electric wiring are there to remember her presence always. Renovated Sister Nivedita Room in Roy Villa Apart from this, Nivedita Educational & Cultural Center has some more plans to execute: :* Free Computer Training Centre :* Free coaching center for joint entrance examinees and IAS / IPS aspirants :* Skill Development Centre for empowering women :* School of Languages :*Exhibition on the life of Sister Nivedita :*Gadadhar Abhyudaya Prakalpa for uplifting local children :* Monthly Ration amounting to 1,000/- to old-aged mothers :* Monthly Medical Camp with free Medicine 13 students in the last 1 year became financially benefited to procure books and 4 poor yet meritorious students received a scholarship of Rs. 12000/-. With this new approach, Roy Villa is moving ahead to provide service to mankind and is the focal point of Ramakrishna Mission in North Bengal.

The song was written by Lewis, Toby Gad and Eg White, with Gad and White producing it. Lyrically, \\"I Am\\" is about the feelings and emotions experienced by Lewis following her departure from her former record label Syco and its boss, Simon Cowell. It is a dance-influenced track which makes use of strings, piano and drums as part of its instrumentation. Its composition garnered comparisons to singers Avril Lavigne and Massive Attack. Island released \\"I Am\\" on 17 July 2015 as the lead single for the United Kingdom, but it is the second single to be released from the album overall. Remixes by Fastlane and DEVolution were also released. The track garnered a positive response from music critics, many of whom praised Lewis' strong and emotive vocal performance and described it as a standout on the album. Lewis has performed the song live on The National Lottery: In It to Win It and at the BBC's Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park festival. Background and composition \\"I Am\\" was written by Leona Lewis, Toby Gad and Eg White, with Gad and White producing the track, for Lewis's fifth studio album of the same name (2015). It was published by ASCAP and Atlas Music publishings (on behalf of itself and Gadfly Songs (ASCAP) and Kobalt Music Group Ltd. White performed much of the song's instrumentation, and is credited with playing the piano, drums, bass and bells, as well as the string and drum programming. The strings were recorded by White and Kristian Larsen in Studio A at Kensaltown Studios, and were arranged by White, transcribed by Clarissa Farran, and contracted by Hilary Skewes. The violins were played by Marije Johnston, Kotono Sato, Max Baillie, Bea Lovejoy, Warren Zielinksi, Janice Graham, Helen Paterson and Hannah Dawson. Meghan Cassidy and James Boyd played the viola, while David Cohen and Ben Chappell played the cello. \\"I Am\\" was mixed by Wez Clarke, with additional mixing carried out by Gad at Kite Music Studios in Los Angeles. The track's audio was mastered by Tom Coyne at Sterling Sound studios in New York City, with assistance from Randy Merrill. Lewis provided all of the vocals for the track. For the acoustic version of \\"I Am\\", Gad undertook all of the instrumentation and also performed the mixing. \\"I Am\\" is a dance-influenced song. Some critics believe the lyrics allude to Lewis' emotions and feelings following her departure from Syco Records and Simon Cowell, her former label boss and friend. Digital Spy writer Lewis Corner felt that the title track had very few barriers, exemplified by the lyrics \\"I am, with or without you / I am, breathing without you / I am, somebody without you.\\" Lewis performs the lyrics over an instrumentation of \\"rousing\\" strings and breakbeats. As she sings \\"I won't change for you,\\" a heavy drum beat and occasional piano chimes reminiscent of songs by Avril Lavigne are played. Release and remixes On 30 June 2015, Lewis released a three-minute teaser video with snippets of \\"I Am\\", \\"Ladders, \\"Power\\" and \\"Thunder\\". \\"I Am\\" was released as the second single from the album and lead single for the United Kingdom; it was not promoted in the United States due to the decision to release the album's third overall single \\"Thunder\\" as its lead single instead. The full length version of \\"I Am\\" premiered on BBC Radio 2 on 17 July 2015. The same day, the track was made available as an automatic download for anyone who had previously pre-ordered the album. A two-track remix EP with dance remixes by Fastlane and DEVolution was also made available as a digital download on 17 July in the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, and New Zealand. \\"I Am\\" was added to BBC Radio 2's B-list playlist on 15 August. Critical reception Kathy Iandoli of Idolator highlighted \\"I Am\\" as a \\"gorgeous standout\\" example of Lewis' ability to \\"just [sing]\\" a song as opposed to using auto-tune on \\"Power\\" and over-singing on \\"I Got You\\". Lewis Corner of Digital Spy felt that the track put \\"Simon [Cowell] in his place in a way Louis Walsh could only dream of.\\" Brad O'Mance for Popjustice likened the song to Massive Attack's 1991 song \\"Unfinished Sympathy\\" \\"with a different song on top\\", while Official Charts Company writer Rob Copsey described it as \\"gutsy and uplifting\\". However, Michael Clemons of The Daily Reveille thought that while it was not a stand out track, it was a good listen. Chuck Campbell of Knoxville News Sentinel thought that the track's lyrical theme, and the album's theme as a whole, was flawed as a concept, writing \\"The problem with repeatedly declaring you don‚Äôt need the approval of someone who has wronged you is that your message is false. Clearly if Lewis indulges in six straight bitter songs about defiantly rebounding from a bad relationship (which she does on ‚ÄúI Am‚Äù), she obviously craves validation from the very person (or people) who did her dirty.\\" Live performance Lewis performed \\"I Am\\" for the first time during a live showcase at the Hospital Club in London on 14 April 2015. The singer premiered four other tracks from I Am including \\"Ladders\\", \\"I Got You\\", \\"Thank You\\" and \\"Fire Under My Feet\\". Stefan Kyriazis of the Daily Star described \\"I Am\\" and \\"Ladders\\" as \\"instant crowd pleasers\\". Lewis later performed the track live on The National Lottery: In It to Win It on 12 September 2015, and again the following day at the BBC's Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park festival. The set- list also included performances of \\"Better in Time\\", \\"Bleeding Love\\", \\"Run\\", \\"Fire Under My Feet\\" and \\"I Got You\\". \\"I Am\\" was included as the opening song on her 2016 concert tour of the same name.

It is a cosmopolitan species occurring in inshore waters of many of the world's oceans, and it has colonised new areas such as the North Sea and the Adriatic Sea. It is subject to large population swings, and has been held responsible for the death of farmed salmon in Norway. The species was first described by J.T. Cunningham in 1892 from a specimen obtained at Plymouth, England. Description Muggiaea atlantica is a small colonial siphonophore, but one of the two nectophores (swimming bells) is undeveloped. The remaining nectophore grows to a length of about . It is translucent and has five straight, longitudinal ridges, some of which may form a keel. The hydroecium (ventral cavity) is about one third of the length of the nectophore, and the long slender somatocyst (extension of the gastrovascular system) reaches the apex of the nectosac (central cavity) and sometimes contains oil droplets. The eudoxid (reproductive stage) soon becomes detached. It has a cone-shaped, asymmetric bract with a wide flanged suture running from apex to base. The right edge of the bract is curved while the left edge is truncated horizontally. The lower surface has a small cavity in which the somatocyst is situated. Distribution and habitat Muggiaea atlantica is a neritic species that forms part of the zooplankton, and is found in the upper hundred metres of inshore temperate and subtropical waters worldwide. It is present in the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. It is a common siphonophore and probably more abundant than any other species of siphonophore in nearshore habitats. Its abundance is seasonal, and in parts of the northern hemisphere it has population peaks in May/June and again in September/November. In the western English Channel it occurred sporadically before the 1960s but after 1968 it became resident. Its seasonal distribution and abundance seem to be associated with sea temperature changes and the availability of food. It appeared in the southern Adriatic Sea for the first time in the mid 1990s and became increasingly common there. It was detected in the marine lakes on the island of Mljet in southern Croatia in 2001, and seems to have displaced Muggiaea kochii in the Great Lake there. It is hypothesized that the cold winter of 2000/2001 favoured the more cold- tolerant M. atlantica over the warm-temperate M. kochii. Ecology Muggiaea atlantica swims in an arc, propelled by pulsations of its bell, and then remains stationary for several minutes. It feeds almost entirely on copepods, consuming an estimated five to ten prey items daily, mostly during the night. In the eastern Pacific it is eaten by predatory fish such as the blue rockfish (Sebastes mystinus), and by the floating sea snail Carinaria cristata. Reproduction in this species is by an alternation of generations between an asexual polygastric animal (bearing both asexual and reproductive elements) and the sexual eudoxid stage which becomes detached from the nectophore. The generation time is short and under favourable conditions, numbers can build up rapidly. A population explosion of M. atlantica in the North Sea in 1989 caused major changes in the composition of the community. The siphonophere was present at densities of five hundred per cubic metre and this depleted the copepods normally present. This resulted in a reduction in the grazing pressure on the phytoplankton and an increase in their growth, causing an algal bloom and other cascading ecosystem effects. The aquaculture industry in Norway suffered a setback in 2007 when more than 100,000 caged salmon were killed by a bloom of M. atlantica, present at a concentration of 2,000 per cubic metre in coastal waters. This siphonophore is also thought to have been involved in the loss of a million farmed salmon in Ireland in 2003.

It is approximately long and flows through Covington Township and Moscow. The creek is inhabited by wild trout. Langan Swamp and Union Mills Swamp are in the watershed. The surficial geology in the area mainly consists of Wisconsinan Till, bedrock, peat bogs, and wetlands. Course Langan Creek begins in a lake in Covington Township. It flows south for a few tenths of a mile and passes through Union Mill Swamp and then turns east for several tenths of a mile. The creek then enters Langan Swamp and turns northeast for a few tenths of a mile before turning east and then north-northwest. After several tenths of a mile, it enters Moscow and reaches its confluence with Van Brunt Creek. Hydrology, geography, and geology The elevation near the mouth of Langan Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. The surficial geology in the vicinity of Langan Creek mainly consists of a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till. However, there are also large patches of bedrock consisting of colgomeratic sandstone, sandstone, and shale, as well as a large patch of wetland and some smaller patches. There is an area of peat bog in the watershed's upper reaches. There is no stream gauge on Langan Creek. Sperry Homes, LLC has a permit to discharge stormwater into the creek in Covington Township. Watershed Langan Creek is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Moscow. Langan Creek is one of the main sources of flooding in Moscow. It and Van Brunt Creek are capable of causing major flooding in the borough. The creek was once dammed to create a pond. The pond has an area of . Additionally, the creek drains a swamp known as Langan Swamp. Union Mill Swamp is also in the watershed. History and recreation Langan Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1178864. In the early 1900s, a bridge over Langan Creek in Covington Township was proposed. It was estimated to cost $800. Langan Creek runs through the Moffat Estate, a 42-acre property in Covington Township. It was given to the township in 2002. In the early 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan recommended that Covington Township and the borough of Moscow include protection of Langan Creek in their zoning plans. A trail running from the sewer plant in Moscow to the Covington Park has been proposed. The trail would run past Langan Creek and the Moffat Estate and have a length of . However, the trail is not planned for the near-term future as of 2013. Biology Wild trout naturally reproduce in Langan Creek from its headwaters downstream to its mouth.

It is characterized by a dense settlement pattern with four- to five-story residential buildings with side and rear wings around an inner courtyard. The designation reflects the period of origin of this town planning solution under the German monarchs Wilhelm I and Wilhelm II. Location The railway line around Berlin on an 1885 map. The dark area at center right is the developed part of the city, which was long constricted by the customs wall The Wilhelmine Ring comprises large parts of the Berlin subdistricts Wedding, Gesundbrunnen, Prenzlauer Berg, Friedrichshain, Kreuzberg, Neuk√∂lln, Sch√∂neberg, Tiergarten, Moabit and Charlottenburg. It arose primarily in the still undeveloped area between the Berlin Customs Wall, which was removed in the 1860s, and a railway line constructed between 1867 and 1877 to encircle the city.Die Stadtbahn in Berlin: Planung, Bau, Auswirkung, Falko Krause, Diplomica Verlag Hamburg 2014 Preconditions and features The commencement of large-scale German industrialization in the latter part of the 19th century led to a pressing need for labor, which was met by a strong rural exodus favoring Berlin, where abundant jobs could be found. Living accommodations for this rapid influx of workers were needed in the immediate vicinity of the new factories, for which there was no space within the old city limits.Harald Bodenschatz, Auf dem Weg zur Mietkasernenstadt?, pp 297-308 in Berlin, 19. Jahrhundert: Ein Metropolen- Kompendium, Roland Berbig et al., Akademie Verlag Berlin 2011 In 1861 a large scale incorporation of neighboring settlements had expanded the area of Berlin by some 70 percent. According to census figures, 547,571 people lived in the city in that year. This population almost tripled in the course of the ensuing 30 years, without significant area growth of the city. The planning for the necessary housing was undertaken in 1862 by James Hobrecht, whose ‚ÄúPlan for developing the surroundings of Berlin‚Äù, as its name indicates, included an area far exceeding the limits of the just-enlarged city. It specified a network of ring and radial streets with relatively large block sizes, which facilitated the rapid construction of large adjoining buildings in which multi-family rental accommodations were planned.James Hobrecht und Berlin, Hans Stimmann, in 150 Jahre Metropole Berlin,Susanne K√§hler et al., Elsengold Verlag Berlin 2015 Typical Wilhelmine Ring building with shops on the ground floor and apartments in the upper storeys, from a postcard featuring Wedding around 1900 A decisive factor was a regulation passed in 1853 by city planning authorities obligating property developers to little more than adhering to a specified street frontage and a minimal size for the inside courtyards of 5.34 √ó 5.34 meters, at that time the turning circle of city wagons with fire- fighting equipment. Therefore, in the following decades private developers building in the area to be known as the Wilhelmine Ring used each land parcel to the maximum possible extent, filling it with five- to six-story buildings containing many, often very small, rental units. Since the developers had to co-finance the street-access infrastructure, with costs calculated on the basis of the width of the street frontage, this part of the building was relatively narrow, the rest being taken up by the side and rear wings. The front apartments were frequently large and spacious and intended for the middle class, containing, particularly in the desirable first upper floor (the bel √©tage or piano nobile), decorative stucco ceilings and parquetry flooring and commanding high rents. The rear wing apartments, by contrast, were much smaller and plainer, harder to ventilate, without views, and usually only offering shared toilet facilities in the hallways or courtyard. These back apartments were primarily rented by working-class families, who in turn sublet rooms to supplement their modest income. In the Wilhelmine Ring the population density was over 1000 per hectare. Over 20 percent of the workers were so- called ‚Äúsleepers-in‚Äù without the resources to rent even a single room, renting a bed on an hourly basis in an apartment that was, even without them, frequently very overcrowded. Only in 1887 did a new regulation impose stricter constraints on property developers. For example, the eaves or lower edge of the roof could not be higher than 22 meters and the number of storeys was limited to five.

Although the ring is still characterized by high density construction and a scarcity of open spaces, the flats are popular because of their historic character and nearness to the city center. In the course of urban redevelopment, renovation and modernization, inner courtyards were sometimes expanded by removing rear or side wings. In other cases the size of the rear apartments was considerably increased by combining them into larger units.

It now forms part of Col√≥n, Cuba. The Cuban EcuRed site gives its population as 5,746 inhabitants and states that it covers an area of . It is located some to the north east of the centre of Col√≥n and east of Havana. The municipal district measured and had a population of 9,206 in 1943. History San Jos√© de los Ramos was founded in 1844 when the first houses were built near the J√∫caro railway. At the centre was the church or chapel of the same name. The original name of the community was Cunagua, a native word which is now one of the neighbourhoods. In 1527, it was sold to Andr√©s Recio and took the name Las Ciegas (The Blind Women) before becoming San Jos√© de los Ramos. In 1879, San Jos√© became a municipality (ayuntamiento). In 1902, it was annexed to Col√≥n but was separated again in 1910. In 1940, it became an integral part of the judicial and fiscal district of Col√≥n. In 1943, it consisted of the districts of Banag√ºises (also Manag√ºises) with a population of 4,103, Cunagua, population 1,187, and San Jos√© de los Ramos, population 3,916. In the War of Independence, more than a hundred of its citizens took up arms against Spain. Geography The community lies on flat land extending from Col√≥n. It is watered by the rivers Palmillias, Piedras, Las Ciegas and Jig√ºe. The La Palma River which enjoys considerable flow is fed by three streams, the first from the Lake of Banag√ºises, the second, known as the Piedra River originating in the Nueva Bermeja and Palmillas and fed by the Jig√ºe, Macagosa and other streams, and the third the creek of Potrerillo. The La Palmas River flows from San Jos√© de los Ramos to its mouth in the Bay of Santa Clara. It can be navigated up to the landing stage known as La Palma. Economy In 1957, the community consisted of 534 farms covering 22% of its territory or (. The main crop was sugar cane, some fruit being grown for local consumption. In 1952, there were 10,700 head of cattle. The soil is rich in limestone and clay which is used for the manufacture of pottery and bricks. Famous citizen F√©lix Ramos y Duarte (1848‚Äì1924), a philologist and educator, remembered above all for his Diccionario de mejicanismos (Dictionary of Mexican Spanish), was born in San Jos√© de Los Ramos.

The effect of Visionscape in Lagos  Lagos state generates over 78 million tons of waste between 2007 and 2013 with collection rate of 28% . The gap in the rate of refuse collection in the state exposes the state to environmental epidemics. On 1 March 2017, the governor Ambode's administration introduces Visionscape a private foreign-owned waste management company to take charge of the activities of waste management in Lagos state. The governor's action was criticized for his decision to dump Lagos State Waste Management Authority ( LAWMA) the state-owned agency created for the management of waste disposal . According to Leadership ‚ÄúMore than 10 months after commencing work with colourful vehicles and waste bins, Visionscape has failed to deliver. After its shaky start which made its promoters to hastily broker a deal to partially recall the PSP Operators, no tangible progress has been recorded in the waste management department.‚Äù in the same vein. The speaker of the state house of assembly, Hon.Mudashiru Obasa also said ‚ÄúWe are seriously working on it and the PSP will soon return.

His grade cricket had been played for the Riverside Cricket Club in the Northern Tasmanian Cricket Association (NTCA), which he captained for a period (also later serving as the club's president). In the 1980s and 1990s, he sat on the selection panel for the state team, and was briefly its chairman. Working in insurance and real estate outside of cricket, Harper died of cancer in 2003 at age 64.

This season was remarkable in the history of the club, because it was the first and only title that RC Lens won in French first division. The club also reached, for the third time in its history, the final of Coupe de France. Daniel Leclercq lead the club in this season, which took place just before the World Cup hosted by France, and for which the Bollaert stadium hosted several games. Leclercq took control of the team early in the season after the previous season's deputy Roger Lemerre. This happened in 1997 to prevent a possible relegation to the second division. Leclercq set up a tactic based on offense and speed. The team relied on players present for several years, such as Jean-Guy Wallemme, a captain of the team, or the goalkeeper Guillaume Warmuz. Anto Drobnjak and St√©phane Ziani also played a central role in the team. Sixth in the mid- season, RC Lens took the championship lead after its victory in their 30th game of the season against league-leader FC Metz. Following that victory, RC Lens remained in first place through to the end of the season. Following this winning streak in the league, RC Lens lost in the final of Coupe de France and in the semifinals of the League Cup against the Paris Saint-Germain.

The piece has been recorded numerous times and remains one of Hovhaness's most popular compositions.

Crowned with a cupola, it stands out in the panorama of the old town and can be seen from surrounding streets. History It is thought that a small (probably wooden) church stood here already in Gediminas' times. In ca. 1408 Vytautas built the church of the Holy Spirit that was later expanded. In 1501 Alexander Jagiellon gave it to the Dominican Monastery, the oldest in Lithuania. In 1679-88 it was expanded and reconstructed. The walls of the church survived from that period; the interior d√©cor was created in 1749-70, the cupola was reconstructed in 1752-60. In 1844 tsarist authorities closed the monastery down and the church became parochial. Today it serves the Vilnius Polish community.Prof. Venclova, Tomas. VILNIUS; R. Paknys Publishing House, At the church, on ≈†v. Ignoto St., a Dominican monastery was established in 1501. Like many others, this monastery was converted into a prison by the tsarist authorities in 1807. It was a place for imprisonment for many Lithuanian patriots - the Philarets, participants in the 1831 and 1863 uprisings. Architecture Church organ The church stands sideways to the street and does not have a clearly designed main fa√ßade. Its height with the cupola is 51 m. The bottom part of the fa√ßade (with small twin towers) is covered over by monastery buildings. The exterior has features of high and late Baroque. Noted for playful rococo ornamentation, the interior of the church is one of the most valuable in Lithuania. It is heralded by the cartouches of the portal with coats of arms and fresco settings in the monastery-like corridor leading to the church. There are 16 altars in the church. The altars and the pulpit are lavishly decorated with round and relief sculptures and ornamentation. The church also has many Baroque frescoes; a multi-figural composition \\"Apotheosis of the Holy Spirit\\" (neo-Baroque, 19th century) in the cupola. 45 paintings in the church (an image of St. Barbara with a 17th- or 18th-century setting, a rococo \\"St. Catherine of Siena\\" by Szymon Czechowicz, a portrait of Alexander Jagiellon by an unknown artist of the second half of the 18th century) are considered monuments of art. Dungeons An entry under the altar leads to the large vaults, which are labyrinthine, with many rooms and crypts. The dungeons house remains of hundreds of Vilnius residents, some of them naturally mummified, and are surrounded by urban legends. While the existence of the dungeons was known, the first efforts to explore and organize the abandoned dungeons were carried out by students of Vilnius University in the 1930s. The students, however, did not observe proper archaeological procedures and did a lot of damage. Their practices included sorting the bones, such as putting all skulls on shelves, and removing grave goods. Since then, the remains were moved many times leaving them in a haphazard and disorganized state. Urban legends claim that these remains are of French soldiers from the 1812 French invasion of Russia or of victims of the Inquisition or plague. More romantic are claims that these dungeons were once part of a larger tunnel network that allowed legendary lovers Barbara Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç and Sigismund II Augustus to meet in secret. In 2011, anthropologists from Vilnius University, led by , began a study of the mummified bodies. They estimated that the vaults hold remains of about 600 people including many women and children from the mid-18th century to the early 19th century.Palaidojim≈≥ Vilniaus Dominikon≈≥ ba≈ænyƒçioje paslaptis The team selected the best preserved mummies and performed their tomography.

And if they have two days when they escape from their offices and families, to get away from all the cares and commitments ‚Äì two days, eventful and adventurous ‚Äì you can be sure that this time they will have time to discuss a lot of things ...

But when you have people next to you with whom you can talk about everything, all the hardships of life become insignificant ... And real men are known to have a lot of different topics for discussion. Work, parties, money, music, clubs, and of course ‚Äì women.

There is also a detailed economic aspect that records a large variety of statistics including under and over employment and natural resources. AI nations work on the same economy system as the player so for example if no one produces enough oil everybody will suffer. Players can choose from nearly any existing country as their starting region, and some sandboxes and scenarios feature sub-national divisions to choose from (such as US States or European ethnic regions).

It deploys wireless broadband connections for trains, metros, trams and buses, including passenger Wi-Fi services and remote condition monitoring for on-board rail components. Headquartered in Newcastle upon Tyne in England, it operates globally. History Nomad Digital was founded by Graeme Lowdon and Nigel Wallbridge in 2002. The co-founders met during the sale of the telecommunications business Wide Area Markets to the business-to-business Internet trading company J2C. Lowdon and Wallbridge identified an opportunity to increase bandwidth and hence provide high speed data and Internet connectivity to moving vehicles, such as trains, using the wireless WiMax system, which can operate through tunnels and underground. As well as providing Internet connectivity, wireless connectivity enables streaming of CCTV security images and allows onboard train equipment and systems to be checked in real time. Initially funded by co-founders Lowdon and Wallbridge, in mid-2006 Amadeus Capital Partners with support from T-Mobile's Venture Fund (T-Venture) invested ¬£8 million venture capital into Nomad. In December 2016, Alstom announced its acquisition of Nomad Digital for a consideration of ‚Ç¨36 million from Amadeus Capital Partners, SEB Venture Capital and Deutsche Telekom.Alstom to acquire Nomad Digital, world‚Äôs leading provider of connectivity solutions to the railway industry Amadeus Capital Partners 21 December 2016 The transaction closed in January 2017. Technology Nomad Digital aggregates a number of communication methods (such as 3G/4G cellular and trackside wireless) to provide a data connection to the train. It connects this to its on-train network that runs along the length of the train and uses Wi-Fi access points in every carriage to create a public hotspot network, providing passengers with access to the public internet and (where available) to other entertainment and information services. The on-board Communications Control Unit also allows train systems to be remotely visible and monitored by the train operator in real-time. Operations Virgin Trains West Coast Class 390 at London Euston The company's first contract was with train operator Southern, offering broadband services on its Brighton to London Victoria service. In 2004, the contract was signed and the project was delivered in partnership with T-Mobile. In the UK, Abellio ScotRail, Arriva CrossCountry, East Midlands Trains, First Great Western, Heathrow Express, NI Railways, South West Trains and Virgin Trains West Coast have utilised Nomad's services. In January 2014, Nomad was contracted to supply the equipment to support the provision of T-Mobile Wi-Fi and multimedia services for passengers travelling on the intercity services operated by Polish State Rail operator, PKP. Up to 300 rail vehicles were equipped with the technology, which also enabled remote condition monitoring of the individual cars and providing the facility to locate their position on the routes. Union Pearson Express train at Mimico GO Station Also in 2014, Nomad signed a contract with Virgin Trains to undertake a fleet-wide WiFi upgrade. The Nomad upgrade was deployed on 56 Pendolino and 20 Super Voyager trains. In 2015, Nomad was contracted to provide the passenger Wi-Fi platform for Union Pearson Express that connects Union Station in downtown Toronto with Toronto Pearson International Airport, Canada's two busiest transportation hubs. In June 2015, Nomad became the first transport technology company to join The Internet Watch Foundation. Nomad brought The IWF's fight against online crime to the railways, by offering an integration of an IWF-licensed service on all existing and future passenger Wi-Fi systems. Nomad is helping to protect UK train passengers from exposure to criminal online content. In November 2015, Nomad established a 10-year partnership with √ñBB (Austrian Federal Railways) to deliver the world's largest multi-transport connectivity deployment. The partnership includes new on-board technology services for up to 900 √ñBB trains as well as 2,000 buses. Also in November 2015, Nomad reported preliminary financial results for the full year ending in 30 June 2015.

While Americans eat of bananas per person per year, the vast majority of the fruit is imported from other countries, chiefly Central and South America, where the US has previously occupied areas containing banana plantations, and controlled the importation of bananas via various fruit companies, such as Dole and Chiquita.In the USA, bananas are the fruit that is consumed ... clui.org History The first commercial banana farm in the United States was established in Florida, near Silver Lake, in 1876. A number of independent banana farms and cultivars have been located in a number of areas, reaching as far north as the southern Midwest and Ohio river, where wild banana trees can be found along the banks of the Ohio at far southern Illinois, Indiana, and Missouri, just north of Kentucky. This region equates roughly with the northernmost terminus of the subtropical crop-growing region of the US, which ends at about Cincinnati, Ohio, and further east in cities and locations such as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, New York City and Long Island in New York, and coastal regions of southern New England. Banana growth further west along this ecological transition line, such as in central to northern Missouri and northern Kansas/far southern Nebraska is highly dubious and uncertain, due to extreme temperature fluctuations and an increase in aridity. Other states that have been popular locations for independent banana farming have been Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina, Mississippi, Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma, Alabama, North Carolina, Hawaii, Virginia, Arizona, California, Nevada, and Maryland. Florida has seen a number of independent and big-name banana cultivars inhabit its land throughout history. Bananas have also been cultivated in states of the Pacific Northwest, including in areas of Washington, Oregon, and various highland areas and sheltered oceanic/temperate valleys in southern Idaho. In the 70's, a variety of bananas, including Ice Cream and Cavendish, were commonly grown throughout the Appalachian region, primarily throughout Tennessee, as well as in Kentucky along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers as well as in mountain areas of the eastern reaches of the state. Current production Total banana production in the USA peaked at 13 154 tonnes in 2010 and has decreased to 3 992 tonnes in 2017. Hawaii is by far the largest banana producer in the United States, followed by Florida. Hawaii produces mainly the conventional Cavendish assortment and the Hawaiian apple banana, which are sold in the local markets due to high employment and land expenses. The chief US banana exporter is Florida, which produces mostly Thai and cooking bananas (Bluggoe type). In addition, US banana producers are looking for opportunities in the organic and specialty segments of the banana market in Florida, Texas, California, Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina, and Georgia.Title:Introduction also US Banana Production edis.ifas.ufl.edu Banana cultivation in Florida has been about 500 acres, valued at roughly 2 million US $. Other states that remain popular locations for independent banana farming, which usually only export on a highly domestic level, are Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma, Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Arizona, California, Nevada, and Maryland. These states produce a variety depending on the region, including Cavendish, Bluggoe, Ice Cream, Goldfinger, Lady Finger, Red Dacca, Latundan, Pisano Awak, and Balbisinia subtypes. Independent banana cultivation in the United States is diverse, with some areas of the country able to sustain fields of a wide variety of banana trees perennially or near-perennially, similar to a plantation system. This is most notable (outside of Florida and Hawaii) in Texas, Louisiana, California, Arizona, Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, and coastal North Carolina. In other areas of the country (northern Arkansas, southern Missouri, mountain Tennessee, southern Kansas, the far southern Midwest and along the Ohio river, Kentucky, and Virginia,) containing a climate similar to that of the banana growing region of inland south-central and eastern China (Sichuan, Anhui, Zhejiang, Hubei, Jiangsu, Henan, Jiangxi, Hunan, Chongqing, and Guizhou provinces,) banana cultivation is more seasonal. If independent cultivation was counted towards a nation's total of banana production, its estimated that the United States would rank at about the 4th or 5th country for banana production in the world. Bananas are also grown commercially in Puerto Rico, Guam, and American Samoa.

Visiting North America and Europe, the tour played over 40 concerts in 2014 and 2015.

Prior to the tour Usher began working with fashion designer Kerby Jean-Raymond For the tour, they created a custom Pyer Moss bike jacket that he wore over a mess shirt with black cargo pants. Completing the outfit he wore Martin Margiela chain embellished red suede sneakers. The November 30, 2014 concert, held at Rexall Place in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada; was livestreamed via Yahoo Live!. Critical reception The tour was met with positive reviews. Jon Paroles from The New York Times wrote: \\"He has established himself as one of R&B;'s supreme performers and craftsmen, following through on what he learned from Michael Jackson in particular.\\" Ashley Lee of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"His routines were sharp, effortless and even playful at times, and he didn't need to rely on constant gyrating to entertain. Usher also shined vocally when he took the time to do so: bouncing his gold mic stand during 'Caught Up', hitting the top of his range on 'Climax', adding extra runs to 'U Remind Me', impressively closing 'Burn' a cappella.\\" Robbyn Mitchell of the Tampa Bay Times wrote: \\"Usher reminded fans constantly that they've been supporting him for 20 years in the music industry -- an unfathomable stat whenever he paused to smile his charming schoolboy girl\\". A.R. Shaw from Rolling Out commented: \\"With new age R&B; acts such Chris Brown and Justin Bieber building their presence in music, some may forget Usher's overall impact on the genre. But the 'UR Experience Tour' proves, again, that Usher's legendary status remains intact.\\". Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"An Usher show has long been an exhilarating affair packed with high-octane choreography held together by sleek, masterful showmanship.\\" Fran√ßois Marchand of The Vancouver Sun states, \\"Usher can embody the cybernetic physicality of a MJ and the pure funk swagger of a JB (as on party jam Twisted ‚Äî 'Hit me one more time!'), and you can applaud an artist who doesn't rely so much on tape playback and shows just how much blood and sweat he leaves out there on the stage.\\" David Smyth from the London Evening Standard gave the performance in London 4 out of 5 stars. He said: \\"Usher himself was quite the mover and shaker, invoking his idol Michael Jackson as he slid and shimmied about the stage in gold trainers. During one triumphant spell, including 'Twisted' and 'Caught Up', his band became an old-style soul revue, horns blasting while the lights blazed. There were snippets of Stevie Wonder and, more surprisingly, Eric Clapton.\\" Opening acts *DJ Cassidy *August Alsina *Nico & Vinz Setlist The following setlist was obtained from the concert held on November 1, 2014; at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

It is the seventh main installment in the Guitar Hero series. The game was released for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One in October 2015 and to iOS devices including Apple TV in November 2015. As with previous games in the series, the goal is to use a special guitar controller to match fret patterns displayed on a scrolling note pattern on screen in time with the music. The game serves as a reboot of the Guitar Hero franchise, being the first new entry in the series since Warriors of Rock in 2010. Activision wanted to bring back Guitar Hero for the next generation of video game consoles but wanted the new game to be innovative. These innovations included a new guitar controller featuring a 6 button, 3-fret layout in contrast to the 5 button controller of previous games. The game featured two main modes; GH Live, the games career mode, featured the note pattern displayed atop full motion video taken from the perspective of a lead guitarist during a concert, with the crowd and other band members dynamically reacting to the player's performance. In the other main mode, GHTV, songs are presented with the note track overlaid atop their music video or from live concert footage. The mode also allows players to pick up and play currently-streamed songs at any time or use money and in-game credits to play any song within the library, forgoing traditional downloadable content. The game was shipped with forty-two songs on disc and 200 songs within the GHTV library; New content has been added to GHTV on a weekly basis, provided through premium shows that earn players unique rewards. Guitar Hero Live was released to mostly positive reception, with critics praising the new controller design for providing trickier and more realistic gameplay in comparison to previous Guitar Hero games, as well as the wider variety of content available via the GHTV mode. The main Live portion of the game received mixed reviews, with critics panning its weak soundtrack, lack of multiplayer and the live action videos. The GHTV mode also received mixed reception for its reliance on microtransactions, and the inability to permanently purchase songs to own. Due to the game's underwhelming sales and reception, Activision laid off many employees of FreeStyleGames and sold the company to Ubisoft in 2017. The GHTV mode was shut down on 1 December 2018, reducing the available Guitar Hero songs from 484 to the 42 present on-disc. Gameplay The updated Guitar Hero Live controller uses a 2 √ó 3 button fret system in contrast to previous games that uses a 1 √ó 5 button scheme. Guitar Hero Live follows similar gameplay to previous installments in the series, requiring players to use a guitar-shaped controller with buttons and a strum bar to match notes on a scrolling \\"highway\\" corresponding to notes played in a song. In contrast to the previous five-button design, the Guitar Hero Live controller features six buttons arranged into two rows of three. The frets are represented by a \\"note highway\\", three scrolling lanes on-screen, containing either black or white notes representing the two rows. Lower difficulty levels use one row of buttons, while higher difficulties may include \\"chords\\" that use a combination of buttons from both rows. The game typically maps out power chords to use the top row of buttons, while modifications of those chords include others from the bottom row. Notes may be held and sustained, indicated by trailing lines after the note markers, during which the player can use the guitar's whammy bar to alter the held note's pitch for effect. Fast-moving sections of songs may employ the use of hammer-on and pull-off notes, marked with a special outline, which can be played without using the strum bar. The game also retains the concept of open strumming introduced in previous Guitar Hero titles, represented as a horizontal bar across the lanes and requiring the player to hit the strum bar without pressing any fret keys. The player is able to select one of four difficulty levels which affect the number and complexity of the note patterns they have to hit, and the speed at which the on-screen display scrolls. Guitar Hero Live can also be played by two players, both playing on separate guitar controllers with split-screen separate note highways, competing for the better score. Songs in GH Live mode (below) also includes vocals, allowing players to sing along in tone with the song's lyrics using a connected microphone. The game is playable via an app on iOS mobile devices, including the fourth-generation Apple TV. This version supports both \\"touch\\" mode and support for an optional Bluetooth-enabled guitar controller that provides \\"[the] full game in an uncompromised way\\" according to Activision. When in touch mode, the note display geared towards the 6-button controller is replaced with four touch-screen buttons but otherwise retains the same gameplay; with the controller, the game otherwise plays the same. Due to the size of the game relative to storage space on most mobile devices, Guitar Hero Live on iOS units requires a persistent Internet connection as all songs, including those that are normally part of the console on-disc soundtrack, are streamed from Activision's servers when played. GH Live Guitar Hero Live utilizes a new presentation style incorporating live-action footage from the perspective of the guitarist, rather than 3D stages and characters. In the game's primary single-player mode, titled GH Live within the game, the player completes songs while experiencing full-motion video taken from the first-person perspective of a band's lead guitarist. The video includes shots of the audience and the band members. As the player performs the songs, the audience responds positively to good performances when few mistakes are made. If the player makes several mistakes in a row, the audience will become critical and start to jeer at the performer. To win back the crowd, the player can either match more notes correctly, or can use collected Hero Power to rapidly regain their interest. Hero Power, replacing Star Power from previous Guitar Hero games, is collected by correctly playing marked series of notes on the track; Hero Power can be accumulated, marked as on- screen guitar picks next to the track, to be used at later times. The player can release Hero Power for a limited time by either tilting the guitar controller upward or hitting a special button on the controller. The career mode is broken up into a dozen-some show sets, each set consisting of about 3‚Äì5 songs. The video for each set includes the band's introduction, banter between the band and crowd between songs, and final ovations on conclusion of the show. The player must unlock each set in order as to move forward. Once a set is complete, the player is shown the game's ranking of their performance and for each song, based on factors such as percentage of notes hit correctly, the longest streak of properly played consecutive notes, and how long they kept the virtual crowd excited about their performance. The player then unlocks the ability to play the individual songs outside of sets. GHTV In addition to songs that were shipped on disc, additional songs were introduced to the game through Guitar Hero TV (GHTV). On starting GHTV mode, the player was given a choice of a number of themed channels, which broadcast playable songs curated programs on a rotating schedule similar to a radio broadcast. One such channel always presented new songs that had been added to GHTV. Songs in GHTV were played over the music video for the song or live concert footage of the band playing the song, instead of the custom visuals for the main single player game. The player could pick up and play on any song that was shown, but was also able to use earned Plays to replay a specific song outside of the channel's rotation. While playing in GHTV, the player was scored to track their performance, and their scores were compared to other players - both those playing at the same time as well as asynchronous scores from other players. To help boost their score, players could accumulate Hero Power in the same fashion as in the GH Live mode. Prior to a song, the player could choose to use Coins, the in-game currency, to purchase one of several Hero Powers which they could deploy during the song, improving their score and performance. Hero Powers included temporary boosts in scoring multipliers, ability to clear all notes for a short distance on the track, or to increase or decrease the density of notes. When a song was complete, the player was ranked based on their performance with the other tracked players, and awarded experience points, Coins, and other bonuses. Experience points are used to raise the player's rank in the GHTV metagame, allowing them to unlock player card skins and other features of GHTV, including Play tokens. Alternatively, players can use the paid, microtransaction currency Hero Cash to purchase access to content. In an update in December 2015, players on GHTV had an opportunity to be randomly pitted in a head-to-head challenge against another player of similar skill level, about twice every half-hour. Winning this head- to-head challenge could give the player an experience point boost. New songs to GHTV were typically introduced via limited-time \\"Premium Shows\\", which ran for a week or more; these songs were then moved into the on-demand catalog and later into the normal GHTV rotation. Access to Premium Shows could be purchased with Hero Cash, or by completing several specific songs in either on-demand or on rotation play. Within the Premium Shows, players competed in the same manner as with normal GHTV songs and could earn unique in-game rewards, such as coins or alternate skins for the on-screen note \\"highway\\". Players could purchase a \\"Party Pass\\" that allowed full access to all of GHTVs on-demand songs and paid features for 24 hours, a mode that FreeStyleGames envisioned to be used when players are hosting large parties or similar events. As first held on the weekend of 6 November 2015, Activision could offer promotional periods that similarly offer full access. In addition to regular content, GHTV was used to provide specialty programming. GHTV offered curated music video shows with host segments wrapped around playable songs; the first such show features songs selected by the band Avenged Sevenfold and included commentary by the band on these selections. Def Leppard used GHTV to premiere their new music video for their single \\"Dangerous\\" in January 2016. Activision offered a contest for players to win prizes by participating in a special \\"Shred-a-Thon\\" premium show, highlighting the addition of DragonForce's \\"Through the Fire and Flames\\"‚Äîone of the most notoriously difficult songs that has appeared in other Guitar Hero titles‚Äîto the GHTV setlist. Activision announced in June 2018 that the GHTV servers will be shut down on 1 December 2018, rendering this functionality unusable. Players will still be able to play songs on disc. The iOS app was also delisted as its functionality would also cease with the shut down of the GHTV servers. Soundtrack The on-disc soundtrack of Guitar Hero Live includes 42 songs and spans across a diverse selection of genres, the developers recognizing that challenging guitar tracks are not strictly limited to rock music. The game's soundtrack include songs by The Black Keys, Blitz Kids, Ed Sheeran, Fall Out Boy, Gary Clark, Jr., Green Day, The Killers, The Lumineers, My Chemical Romance, Pierce the Veil, The Rolling Stones, Skrillex, and The War on Drugs. Pre-orders of the game offered access to a time-limited premium show featuring three live recordings by Avenged Sevenfold, including \\"Shepherd of Fire\\", \\"Buried Alive\\" and \\"Nightmare\\", filmed from their performances at the Download Festival in England and Mexico City. Additional songs are provided through GHTV. Two hundred songs were playable on GHTV at launch, and the developers plan on adding new songs to GHTV on a regular basis. There is no backward compatibility with songs or controllers from previous editions of the franchise; FreeStyleGames' developer Jamie Jackson justified the decision, explaining that Guitar Hero Live was a \\"completely new game\\" that existing content would not work with due to the change in core gameplay. There is not any traditional downloadable content for the game in the form of additional songs, instead using the streaming nature of GHTV to provide new songs. FreeStyleGames does not expect to make GHTV content available for offline play. Development Background and aborted reboot Rhythm games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band had been widely popular between 2005 and 2008, but due to oversaturation of the market and the onset of the recession in 2009, the rhythm genre suffered major setbacks, and the genre's popularity had quickly waned. Sales of the previous installment Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock were below estimates and lower than previous games in the series. Weak sales of Warriors of Rock, in part, led to Activision cancelling a planned 2011 sequel, and shuttering the Guitar Hero franchise. In a July 2011 interview with Forbes.com, Activision CEO Bobby Kotick stated that they were going to try to \\"reinvent\\" the series, but a former teammember of Vicarious Visions has stated that as of 2012, all development of Guitar Hero has come to an end within Activision. Another source close to Vicarious Visions had reported to Kotaku that while Guitar Hero 7 was in development under an Activision studio, the game was considered a \\"disaster\\". The cancelled game omitted the additional instruments and used only a guitar peripheral, redesigning the unit to include six strings replacing the strum bar; the resulting unit was considered too expensive to manufacture and purchase. The developers had started from scratch to try to create new characters and venues that would be more reactive to the actual songs being played, to give the feel of a music video, but ultimately this proved too much of a challenge and had to be scrapped. Further, with a limited budget, the song selection was limited to \\"low-budget\\" hits of the 1990s, or at times reusing songs that had previously been included in Guitar Hero games. Though the team had a two-year development cycle, it was closed down after Activision president Eric Hirshberg had seen the current state of the project at the one-year point. Daniel Dilallo, a developer for Vicarious Visions at the time of cancellation, stated that he had come up with an idea of revitalizing the series using a first-person perspective approach, and had developed a prototype that he had called Guitar Hero Live at the time, though neither Activision nor FreeStyleGames have confirmed if this prototype was used as inspiration for the revived series. As Guitar Hero Live In February 2015, rumors surfaced that new entries in both the Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchises for eighth generation consoles were in development; Harmonix announced Rock Band 4 on 5 March 2015. On 14 April 2015, Activision officially announced a reboot of the Guitar Hero franchise, Guitar Hero Live, with development by FreeStyleGames. In an interview with Fortune magazine, Activision's CEO of Publishing Eric Hirshberg found that even after five years without a game, the Guitar Hero brand still enjoyed high social media attention, with over 10 million followers on the Guitar Heros Facebook page. However, Hirshberg stated that Activision realized they needed to reinvent the series so that consumers would not consider it much the same as previous games and to help sway those that were turned off by the earlier saturation of music games. The task of developing the new game was given to FreeStyleGames around 2012. FreeStyleGames had developed both DJ Hero and DJ Hero 2, and while both games were critically praised, the latter was released on the downward trend of the music game genre. FreeStyleGames had suffered some layoffs as a result of the hiatus of the Guitar Hero series, though remained an Activision studio and financially viable due to their work for the Wii U Sing Party. As the development of Sing Party wrapped up, the studio created an internal research and development department to begin brainstorming what their next game would, with input from Activision. Hirshberg had encouraged the team to reconsider Guitar Hero, noting the fan dedication to the series, but noted that the game needed innovation to be successful. Activision gave the team freedom to develop the game without relying on the previous titles in the series. The core gameplay of Guitar Hero Live was rebuilt from scratch; developer Jamie Jackson explained that the goal of the game was to bring \\"big innovation\\" to the franchise rather than continue with the same format used by previous games. He explained to his staff to only \\"think of [Guitar Hero] as a name. Think of it as a music game with a guitar peripheral, but pretend that nothing else has ever been done.\\" The team brainstormed on what had made the Guitar Hero series fun, and recounted the earlier titles of the series which were designed to enable the player to envision themselves as a superstar guitarist, subsequent design choices were made around recreating that experience. The team also cited fellow Activison franchise Call of Duty as an influence towards the goal of providing an immersive, first-person experience. Though FreeStyleGames experimented with other options including a controller-less game, camera and motion detection, and social-based games, but recognized quickly that the guitar controller was a key part of the series' success. The developers recognized they wanted to have a guitar controller that players would not be embarrassed to have in their living rooms and spent time getting the look of the controller accurate to a real guitar. The design of the game's guitar controller was overhauled, using rapid prototyping to test potential guitar designs. The final design of the controller for Live utilizes a new design with six buttons arranged into two rows of three frets, designated by black and white-colored notes in-game, instead of using the traditional row of five colored frets used by previous Guitar Hero games. Jackson explained that the new layout was meant to make the game easier for new players, as the three- button layout avoids the need to use one's pinkie finger, a difficulty they recognized new players had on the traditional five-button controller. The layout was also designed to provide a new challenge to experienced players, including more realistic simulations of chords. The choice to use only three buttons also came from statistical analysis of past games, where about 80% of the players would never play harder than the Medium difficulty level which typically only required the use of three fingers with the previous five-button controllers. The initial controller iterations, presented both in-studio and to Activision, were met with skepticism but they found that players quickly adapted to the new scheme as an improvement over the older controllers. The \\"note highways\\" for the songs were created by both programmers and musicians using MIDI software as to map to each of the six controller buttons and the open strum bar. Note highways were developed first for the Expert difficulty level, essentially recreating the guitar part of the song note for note, while highways for lower difficulty levels were then constructed by removing notes while assuring the core rhythm of the song remained. The Bolt tracking camera (on left) was used to capture the other band actors and audience members to create the live-action footage for the game. The game itself is presented in a more realistic and immersive style; the rendered stages and characters of previous games are replaced by full motion video, shot from the first-person perspective of the lead guitarist, simulating real-world concert settings. The video footage is dynamic, and can transition between versions featuring positive or negative reactions by the crowd and band members based upon the player's performance. The first-person footage utilizes session musicians as actors playing the remaining members of the band, and is filmed using a Bolt robotic camera system, programmed to simulate the motions of a guitarist on stage. The Bolt ran along a track, and was able to move and turn quickly, mimicking the speed of a musician's movements. Prior to filming with the Bolt, an actor outfitted with motion and position detectors acted out the song with the other band actors; these movements were recorded and then used to direct the Bolt as it replaced the actor in subsequent takes. To avoid injury to the other actors from the motions of the camera, the routines were all choreographed based on the camera's motions and used as cues for the other actors. To enable smoother transitions between positive and negative versions of the band footage, multiple takes were performed for each song using the same camera motions. Groups of 200 to 400 actors were filmed using a green screen to construct crowds; using varying takes and other editing techniques, the groups of actors could be made to cover much larger areas. To simulate larger crowds, these shots were superimposed on a combination of live footage from actual rock concerts and 3D models constructed by FreeStyleGames. The effects studio Framestore helped with editing and assembling the digital live- action footage. Positional audio effects are also used as part of the footage, varying the volume of certain instruments depending on how close the player is to them on-screen in the footage. Ten different bands represent the songs in the \\"Guitar Hero Live\\" mode, playing in two different music festivals. Members of these fictional bands were selected through auditions prior to filming, making sure that they could recreate the actual performance of a song, as well as mixing and matching members of ensemble groups to get the right look and feel. Bands were filmed in a warehouse in Oxford, England. To help with creating appropriate stage presence for the fictional bands and their fans, FreeStyleGames created material that each band would have had in the band's career, such as album covers and clothing, using various musical genres to help inspire their designs. GHTV was designed by FreeStyleGames to allow them to provide new music without having to secure more stringent music licensing rights. FreeStyleGames found that this mode attracted the attention of bands who were eager to offer their music for it; the bands saw GHTV as comparable to the marketing that music television channels had done in the 1980s and 1990s, putting the imagery of the band at the player as they played along. FreeStyleGames also compared GHTV to music services like Spotify and Pandora Radio. This approach makes it easier to secure licensing rights, and fits in better with the current \\"throwaway culture\\" nature of society today according to Jackson. Jackson explained that the feature and its curated playlists were \\"about discovering music as much as it is about going and finding music you know you already like\\". Activision's Hirshberg stated that GHTV was developed as a better means to provide new songs to players through a round-the-clock content platform, rather than relying on scheduled downloadable content, allowing the company to provide a much larger quantity of songs, with plans for \\"hundreds at launch on day one\\" of the game's release. Guitar Hero Live was considered to be a game that can be expanded upon in the future through content patches, as opposed to released new titles each year which had previously led to the music genre decline in 2009. Though FreeStyleGames added vocals prior to the game's launch, there are no present plans to include other instruments such as bass guitar or drums in the title, with Jackson stating that the game is \\"all about guitars\\". Marketing and promotion On 14 April 2015, Hirshberg and Jackson invited Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy and Gerard Way of My Chemical Romance to promote the game. Wentz performed his band's song \\"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark\\" in the Guitar Hero Live mode, while Way and Jackson dueled each other on My Chemical Romance's song \\"Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na)\\". A commercial for the game was revealed in October 2015, starring Lenny Kravitz and James Franco. In conjunction with Activision, The CW ran special promotional ads for Guitar Hero Live, featuring the actors David Ramsey and Candice Patton playing the game in the week prior to the game's release. Activision arranged to have rapper Macklemore play Guitar Hero Live with FreeStyleGames' Jamie Jackson during the halftime show of the Seattle Seahawks home game on the Sunday prior to the release of the game. Reception Guitar Hero Live received mostly positive reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Wii U version 83.75% based on 4 reviews and 84/100 based on 4 reviews, the PlayStation 4 version 81.91% based on 43 reviews and 80/100 based on 69 reviews and the Xbox One version 80.93% based on 20 reviews and 81/100 based on 21 reviews. Most reviewers praised the risk of changing up the gameplay of Guitar Hero with the new controller design, contrasting to Rock Band 4s reliance on its established gameplay mechanics. Chris Carter of Destructoid considered the change a reinvention of the series, and though he had to relearn how to play the controller, enjoyed the experience and \\"the increased emphasis on chords and fancy finger-work\\". Griffin McElroy of Polygon also praised the new controller, finding that the higher difficulties in the game present \\"the most challenging fake guitar-playing\\" that he's seen, and having to relearn the new playing style through the game's difficulties levels was a \\"delight\\". Matt Miller of Game Informer found the six-button layout was not any better than the traditional five-button one, but \\"nails a different dynamic\\" as it feel like one was playing more realistic guitar chords. Though Game Revolutions Nick Tan was impressed with the challenge of the new controller, he felt the buttons themselves were too small and tight on the neck of the controller, and the new challenge may cause more casual players to forgo attempt to learn the new system and go back to Rock Band and the traditional layout. The full-motion video aspect of GH Live was not as well- taken as the core gameplay. GameSpots Scott Buttersworth found that he often ignored the motion video as he was too focused on the gameplay, and when he did notice it, felt it appeared \\"so campy [that] it borders on parody\\" as it \\"absolutely trips over itself to sell you on the idea that you're a totally super cool rockstar\\". Tristan Ogilvie of IGN also felt that the live action footage was \\"overly cheesy vamping\\", and further felt no connection to the band and bandmates he was to be playing along with as there was very little context given between sets. Ben Griffin of GamesRadar found that the crowd and bandmates only seemed to have two states, \\"fawning and furious\\", making the transition disconcerting when the game switched between the two states simply based on his performance. Brandon Jones of GameTrailers believed it was difficult to \\"take the actors seriously\\" in part due to the duality of the crowd reaction as well as that the song was still based on studio recordings, sounding off in the concert setting. Jones further commented that the fictional bands were well-matched to the songs they played, and that the pacing of the presentation, moving quickly between songs, made the experience feel more like a real concert. McElroy acknowledged the presentation can potentially be \\"cringe-worthy\\", but felt that the video was put together with self-awareness of this factor to make it more charming, noting some of the extra details that FreeStyleGames and the actors used to fully take on their roles. The soundtrack for the GH Live portion was also considered weak. McElroy found most of the songs were from 2000 or later, forgoing classic rock songs, and considered the soundtrack to be the \\"biggest disappointment\\" of GH Live. Buttersworth stated that many of the on-disc selections are pop songs that \\"just aren't cut out for Guitar Hero gameplay\\", as they feature the same repeating guitar riff over and over. Griffin was more favorable of the on-disc set list, finding that the tracks represented \\"the music landscape as it is rather than as it was\\". Carter also appreciated the soundtrack, calling it a \\"good spread\\" of songs that can appeal to everyone. The GHTV mode has mixed opinions, with most reviewers praising the concept, with the presentation of the channels were highlighted as hearkening to the heyday of MTV, and giving the player the ability to explore new music. However, reviewers were critical of the emphasis on microtransactions, and though the game was \\"generous\\" with providing free Plays and other in-game currency rewards, this approach could still disappoint some players. Carter found that he could ignore the microtransactions and instead enjoy the freely-playable curated music channels, helping him to play music that he had not yet heard or was outside of his normal play style, giving him a \\"a really cool feeling\\" about exploring new music, as well as seeing music videos from his youth again. Ogilvie similarly found that he could spend his time in GHTV within the free channels exploring new music, but believed the mode was \\"somewhat inflexible for the time poor\\" as players may not find the type of music they want to play when they are ready the play and that there was a lack of a programming guide for these channels. Griffin said that the pricing structure was weak compared to established DLC models, believing that the pricing for options like the Party Pack would have been better used to unlock the ability to play songs that he would enjoy. Miller stated that the microtransaction \\"structure is exploitative\\", preventing him from easily accessing his favorite songs to play and making him frustrated with the game in the long run. Buttersworth was displeased with the need to grind through songs in the free channels as to earn Play tokens to access a song he wanted to play, and the ability to permanently unlock a song, stating \\"that lack of freedom undermined a lot of the fun\\". Premium shows were particularly noted as problematic, in addition to the lack of a practice mode for the GHTV songs, which may impact how those players that seek to perfect every song would enjoy the game mode. Tan noted that in addition to either the time to complete the challenges or in-game currency to unlock the show, the player would have to complete the show in one of the ranked positions to earn the offered prize, and if they failed, they would have to repeat that process again. In an earnings report shortly following the game's release, Activision stated that Guitar Hero Live was outselling their previous two Guitar Hero games, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock and Guitar Hero 5, though did not report exact sales numbers. In their quarterly earnings results presented in February 2016, Activision reported that sales for Guitar Hero Live missed their expectations, and in March 2016, announced that they had to let go of about 50 of FreeStyleGames' employees, though the studio still remains open to continue additional work for Activision. Prior to the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016, Activision stated they will continue to produce content for Guitar Hero Live but have no present plans for another game. Guitar Hero Live was nominated for \\"Game of the Year\\" for the 2016 NME Awards, and for \\"Family Game of the Year\\" at the 19th Annual Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences DICE Awards. It was also nominated for \\"Excellence in Convergence\\" for the 2016 SXSW Gaming Awards, and for the \\"Family\\" award at the 2016 British Academy Games Awards. A class-action lawsuit was filed against Activision in September 2018 in regards to the planned December shutdown of the GHTV service. The suit contends that Activision did not give a reasonable period of notice in a clear manner that the service would shut down, rendering most of the available songs unplayable. The suit was dismissed by the plaintiff without prejudice in January 2019. In February 2019, Activision offered refunds for anyone that had purchased Guitar Hero Live from December 2017 to January 2019, though did not state the reasons for this refund.

She was an inspiration for Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez. She wrote and acted in an autobiographical film, El balc√≥n vac√≠o (The Empty Balcony), which was one of the first films to depict the life of Spanish exiles during the Spanish Civil War. Biography Born in Pamplona on 17 August 1926, Mar√≠a Luisa was the third and last daughter of Luis El√≠o Torres and Carmen Bernal L√≥pez de Lago, who had married in 1920. Her father, a lawyer and judge, suffered for his left-wing tendencies during the Spanish Civil War and was imprisoned, but managed to escape. In late 1939 he was smuggled to the border, and after a brief time in the Gurs concentration camp, he made his way to Paris and was reunited with his family. On February 16, 1940, they departed for Mexico. Mar√≠a Luisa, an intelligent, glamorous woman, studied drama, became involved in cultural and literary circles and married Jom√≠ Garc√≠a Ascot, also the child of exiles, in 1952. After arriving in Mexico, El√≠o began studying drama with Seki Sano, a Japanese exile living in Mexico. She was a member of the group Poetry Out Loud and published poetry works in newspapers and magazines. She also wrote short stories, screenplays and performed on Mexican television. In 1960, her husband was invited to go to Cuba and participate in a film, Cuba 58 being filmed there. Originally five segments were planned for the film, but the final composition contains only three, two of which were created by Garc√≠a Ascot. Garc√≠a planned a new project, a musical comedy in the style of West Side Story, but had to abandon the project as the political situation in Cuba deteriorated. The couple returned to Mexico and began working in a collaboration with Emilio Garc√≠a Riera to produce one of the first films about Spanish exiles. The film, El bac√≥n vac√≠o (The Empty Balcony) is El√≠o's autobiographical story and she wrote the script of the film. She also acted in the film. Shooting only on weekends because the trio all had regular jobs, the film took a year to produce and was not a commercial success, though it did win awards. El√≠o and her husband were personal friends of the writer Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez and his masterwork, One Hundred Years of Solitude was dedicated to them with the inscription, ‚ÄúPara (to) Jom√≠ Garc√≠a Ascot y Mar√≠a Luisa El√≠o‚Äù. In the eighteen months that he took to write the book, they went to his house every night and critiqued the versions of the story as it developed. In 1968, El√≠o and Garc√≠a Ascot divorced. In 1970, she took their son Diego (born 1963) with her and made her first return trip to Spain. She wrote a book, Tiempo de llorar (Time to Weep) in 1988 about the bittersweet return and the breakdown she had as a result. A second book, Cuaderno de apuntes en carne viva (Notebook in Living Flesh) published in 1995, attempted to explore the journey of putting her broken pieces back together. Those who came as children from Spain as exiles to Mexico, called themselves The Nepantla Generation, a Nahuatl word which describes the state of belonging to two places at the same time. Neither of one, nor the other. El√≠o described herself as being caught between past and present which hampered her ability to see the future. El√≠o died in Coyoac√°n, Mexico City, on 17 July 2009.

It now hosts the Church Heritage Museum. History In 1594-97 the church was commissioned by the Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania Lew Sapieha as a mausoleum for his family. The construction was finished in ca. 1604, but in 1627 the roofing fell in; later stonemason Jonas Kajetka rebuilt it. During the 1655-61 war with Moscow the Cossacks burned down and ravaged the church; it was renovated in 1663-73. A Baroque belfry was built in the 1st quarter of the 18th century. The church was closed down by the tsarist authorities in 1888, and in 1905 returned to Sapiehas, renovated in 1905-12. In 1933 both the church and monastery were renovated again (under supervision by Stanislaw Lorentz). In 1972-2006 the Museum of Architecture operated in the church. Church Heritage Museum was established in 2009 at the church. Museum presents and exhibits the oldest sacral valuables. In the centre of the exposition is treasury of Vilnius Cathedral. Lectures, concerts, book presentations are held in the Museum. Educational programmes for children and adults introduce the history of Lithuanian Church, sacral art and architecture.http://www.bpmuziejus.lt/index.php?lang=en Architecture The harmonious whitewashed fa√ßade of St. Michael is built in a transitional style from Renaissance into Baroque; there are twin towers with elegant Baroque spires on both sides. The fa√ßade is divided by pilasters with original capitals decorated with floral motifs; the pediment has a frieze, also with floral motifs. Atop the belfry sits an iron weathervane (18th century) representing Saint Michael the Archangel crushing the devil underfoot. The interior is rich but austere.

It was released on March 27, 2015. Synopsis This story takes place in the far future after a cataclysmic event that forces humanity to revert to a medieval-style civilization. Wugreb, the leader of a Tibetan tribe called the Wu Tribe, led an expedition to the Western Regions of China to rediscover an ancient city called Tech City, which their ancestors created at the acme of their civilization. Wugreb, however, became drunk with the new- found technology he recovered from Tech City, and uses it to created a vast army of monsters and demons to conquer the world, starting with the Western Regions. His plans for global domination were thwarted, however, by the guardian goddess of Tibet, Kelsang. Wugreb is then imprisoned within the tomb of Kuger for a thousand years. The effects of Wugreb's onslaught are evident around the world. Many new creatures and even new human species rise up because of Tech City's return to the world. The seal placed by Kelsang, holding Wugreb in his prison, begins to wane in power. It's up to a young storyteller and her warrior comrades from around the world to rise up and stand against the invasion of Wugreb and the return of Tech City.

Specifically among those imprisoned under the Gulag system of the Soviet era, the tattoos served to differentiate a criminal leader or thief in law from a political prisoner. The practice grew in the 1930s, peaking in the 1950s and declining in popularity in the 1970s and 1980s.  Origins  The branding of criminals was practised in Russia long before tattooing was customary, and was banned in 1863. In the 19th century, a \\"pricked\\" cross on the left hand was often used to identify deserters from the army, and up until 1846, criminals sentenced to hard labour were branded \\"BOP\\" (thief), the letters on the forehead and cheeks. Brands were also applied to the shoulder blade and the right forearm, in three categories; \\"CK\\" for Ssylno-Katorzhny (hard labour convict), \\"SP\\" for Ssylno-Poselenets (hard labour deportee) and \\"–ë\\" for Begly (escapee). In 1846, VOR was replaced by \\"KAT\\"; the first three letters of the word for \\"hard labour convict\\" or katorzhnik. In the 1930s, Russian criminal castes began to emerge, such as the Masti (suits) and the Vor v Zakone (rus. –í–æ—Ä –≤ –ó–∞–∫–æ–Ω–µ) or Blatnye (authoritative thieves), and with that a tattoo culture to define rank and reputation. Up until World War II, any tattoo could denote a professional criminal, the only exception being tattoos on sailors. Under the Gulag system of the Soviet era, laws that were implemented in mid-1940 allowed short prison sentences to be given to those convicted of petty theft, hooliganism, or labor discipline infractions. This led to an increase in the prison population during and after World War II. By January 1941, the Gulag workforce had increased by approximately 300,000 prisoners. Tattoos served to differentiate between an authority or \\"thief in law\\", and the many hundreds of thousands of political prisoners who were imprisoned during and shortly after World War Two for crimes not considered those of a \\"Vor\\" (thief). Some of the motifs came from English sailor tattoos, such as the flying tall ships, a heart pierced by a dagger, anchors, a serpent-entwined heart or a tiger baring its teeth. A thief's collection of tattoos represents his \\"suit\\" (mast), which indicates his status within the community of thieves and his control over other thieves within the thieves' law. In Russian criminal jargon or Fenya (—Ñ–µ–Ω—è), a full set of tattoos is known as frak s ordenami (a tailcoat with decorations). The tattoos show a \\"service record\\" of achievements and failures, prison sentences and the type of work a criminal does. They might also represent his \\"thief's family\\", naming others within hearts or with the traditional tomcat image. Misappropriation of the tattoos of a \\"legitimate thief\\" could be punished by death, or the prisoner would be forced to remove them themselves \\"with a knife, sandpaper, a shard of glass or a lump of brick\\".  Bitch war  After World War II a schism occurred in the criminal world. Many convicts had fought in penal units, in contravention of the thieves' code that no thief should serve in the military or cooperate with authorities in any way. Many legitimate thieves found themselves demoted to frayer (outsider), muzhik (peasant), or suka (traitor, a bitch). This was part of a power struggle; with limited resources in prison, outlawing the \\"bitches\\" (suki) allowed the legitimate thieves to take more for themselves. Tattoos were modified and new designs appeared to distinguish between the two groups. The dagger piercing a heart was modified, adding an arrow: this tattoo indicated a legitimate thief and his desire to seek vengeance against those who had violated the thieves' code. The compass rose became an indicator of aggression to prison officials and the \\"bitches\\", indicating the vow that \\"I will never wear epaulettes\\" and hatred towards those who had served in the Soviet Army. Secret acronyms were created by legitimate thieves that the \\"bitches\\" wouldn't recognise, such as SLON (lit. \\"elephant\\"), meaning \\"Suki Lyubyat Ostry Nozh\\" (\\"Bitches love a sharp knife\\").  Khrushchev's reforms and decline of tattooing  In the 1950s Nikita Khrushchev declared a policy for the eradication of criminality from Soviet society. Along with propaganda denouncing the \\"traditional thief\\" that had grown in popularity in Russian culture, punishments in the prisons intensified for anyone that identified as a legitimate thief, including beatings and torture. As a response to this persecution, the thieves' laws were intensified and the punishment for prisoners wearing unearned tattoos increased from removal to rape and murder. By the 1970s, the intensification of the thieves' laws had resulted in reprisals against the legitimate thieves, orchestrated by prison authorities who would often throw a legitimate thief into cells with prisoners they had punished or raped. To reduce tensions, criminal leaders outlawed rites of passage and outlawed rape as a punishment. Fights between inmates were outlawed and conflicts were to be resolved through mediation by senior thieves. Additionally, a fashion for tattooing had spread through juvenile prisons, increasing the number of inmates with \\"illegitimate\\" tattoos. This ubiquity along with the reduction in violence meant that the \\"criminal authorities\\" stopped punishing \\"unearned\\" tattoos. In 1985, perestroika and the new increase in tattoo parlours made tattooing fashionable, and further diluted the status of tattoos as a solely criminal attribute.  Application  The tattooists, or kol'shchiki (prickers), were held in high regard. Tattoo needles can be referred to as peshnya (ice pick), pchyolka (bee), shpora (spur), or shilo (sting), while the tattoo machine can be referred to as mashinka (little machine) or bormashina (dentist's drill), and the ink is referred to as either mazut (fuel oil) or gryaz (dirt). The tattoos themselves were referred to as a reklama (advertising), regalka (regalia), kleimo (brand), or rospis (painting).  Designs  Common designs and themes grew over the years, often having different meanings depending on the location of the tattoo. The imagery often does not literally mean what it is depicting‚Äîfor example, tattoos displaying Nazi imagery represent a rejection of authority rather than an adherence to Nazism. Combinations of imagery, such as a rose, barbed wire and a dagger, form combined meanings. According to lexicographer Alexei Plutser-Sarno, the tattoos become the only \\"real aspects of his life\\". They are a symbol of the owner's commitment to war against the non-thief, the police (menty), and the \\"bitch\\" (suka). The environment in the Soviet era was one of heavy visual propaganda, and the tattoos are a reaction to that, and a \\"grin at authority\\" (oskal na vlast), often directly parodying official Soviet slogans with Communist Party leaders often depicted as devils, donkeys, or pigs. A thief's collection of tattoos represent his \\"suit\\" (mast), which indicates his status within the community of thieves and his control over other thieves within the thieves' law. They might also represent his \\"thief's family\\", naming others within hearts or with the traditional tom cat image. * Stars ‚Äì Indicate authority. On the shoulders or the knees (\\"I kneel to no-one\\"). The eight-pointed star denotes rank as thief in law depending on where it is placed. * Cat ‚Äì Traditional sign of a thief, often with a hat (from \\"Puss in Boots\\"). The abbreviation \\"KOT\\" (kot; cat) stands for \\"a chronic prison inmate\\" (–∫–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –æ–±–∏—Ç–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å —Ç—é—Ä—å–º—ã, korennoy obitatel tiurmy) * Lenin or Stalin ‚Äì Often tattooed on the chest, partly from a belief that a firing squad would never follow orders to shoot such an image. * Orthodox church ‚Äì Indicates a thief, usually a chest tattoo, with the number of cupolas indicating the number of convictions. * Suns ‚Äì Rays can be used to indicate number and length of sentences served. * Skull ‚Äì Indicates a murderer.

On the buttocks can indicate a passive homosexual. * A circled \\"A\\" (done in the style of a finger ring) indicates an anarchist (–∞–Ω–∞—Ä—Ö–∏—Å—Ç, anarkhist) * Circle with a dot inside (as finger ring) known as \\"The Roundstone\\" - Indicates an orphan (–∫—Ä—É–≥–ª—ã–π —Å–∏—Ä–æ—Ç–∞, krugliy sirota), or the saying \\"Trust only yourself\\" (–Ω–∞–¥–µ–π—Å—è —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –Ω–∞ —Å–µ–±—è, nadeisya tolko na sebya) * Skull inside a square (as finger ring) - Indicates a conviction for robbery (—Å—É–¥–∏–º –∑–∞ —Ä–∞–∑–±–æ–π, sudim za razboy) * Quincunx - Indicates one who has done extensive time, from the saying \\"the four walls and I\\" or \\"four guard towers and me\\" (—á–µ—Ç—ã—Ä–µ –≤—ã—à–∫–∏ –∏ —è, chetyre vyshki i ya) * Snake entwined with a woman - Indicates a passive homosexual, especially if tattooed on the back.

Beneath the eyes indicates a passive homosexual and by the mouth indicates a passive partaker in oral sex. On the chin indicates a rat (krysa) who steals from other prisoners. A forced tattoo. * \\"Red\\" card suits, diamonds and hearts, on the back indicate a passive homosexual. Often a forced tattoo.  Hand and ring tattoos  Tattoos on the hands and fingers were common, and for women, palm tattoos showing insults were popular in the 1940s and 50s. * A church with three cupolas ‚Äì \\"eternal prisoner\\" applied to someone with at least three convictions. * An eagle ‚Äì denotes an authoritative thief, or an escapee from a camp. * The letters \\"–û–ú–£–¢\\" (omut; water hole) on the back of the hand indicate one from whom it is difficult to get away (–æ—Ç –º–µ–Ω—è —É–π—Ç–∏ —Ç—Ä—É–¥–Ω–æ, ot menya uiti trudno, it's hard to get away from me) * The letters \\"–ú–ò–†\\" (mir; world or peace) on the back of the hand denote one who will never be rehabilitated or re-educated (–º–µ–Ω—è –∏—Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç —Ä–∞—Å—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª, menya ispravit rasstrel, only execution will correct me) * A heart indicates a despised thief with no status, convicted for rape. * A winged arrow means a traveling thief. * A crown indicates a criminal boss or authority * White cross on a black background; \\"I've been through the crosses\\" indicating that they have served solitary confinement. * Silhouettes of birds; \\"Love and cherish freedom\\". * Crosses on knuckles can indicate number of times in prison.  Forced tattoos  There are tattoos that are forcibly applied to signify \\"demotion\\" (razzhalovanie). These may depict sexual acts, and are designed to lower the owner in the eyes of other prisoners and draw harsh treatment from them. These can be applied to those convicted of sexual crimes, those who have not paid a debt, stool pigeons (ssuchenye), stooges (chukhany), and signify that the owner is expelled from the privileged section of a thieves society and are \\"untouchables\\" (neprikasaemye/chushki). Other thieves must not accept anything from them or be considered \\"infected\\" (zakontachit'sya). As a thief is \\"born\\" with his tattoos, they can also be used to signify his \\"death\\" and new status as an \\"untouchable\\". Even established thieves could be demoted, if, for example, they lost a card game and failed to honor their bets.

Her work demonstrated that objective ideas about women's attributes are socially constructed. Although her early training was in psychology and philosophy, her most prolific research engagements concerned women's social roles and how these changed after the Industrial Revolution. She was one of the first scholars to bring quantitative evidence to bear on this socio-economic topic. Her research not only illuminated the changing roles of women in society, but she also wrote and lectured on concrete social and political changes that would help facilitate these new roles. Early life Viola Klein was born in Vienna in 1908 to a Jewish family. As a young student she moved to Prague with her family owing to political circumstances after studying one year at the Sorbonne University in Paris and a short period at the University of Vienna. She continued her studies at the University in Prague and graduated in fields of psychology and philosophy. During her studies in Prague she worked as an assistant editor. Besides psychology and philosophy, she was also interested in French literature. Her first doctoral thesis was about the linguistic style of the modernist French author Louis-Ferdinand Celine (Lyon 2007, p. 831). Because of her interest in the woman question she visited the Soviet Union in the 1930s. Inspired by this visit she wrote several articles in British magazines about ‚Äúdouble speak‚Äù (Lyon 2007, p. 832). It represented the new role of women in society, marriage and the family. In 1938 she and her brother migrated to England. Shortly after fleeing, Viola's parents died in a Nazi concentration camp. As Jewish refugees, Viola and her brother had problems finding work in England. For a short period of time she worked as a domestic servant until she finally received a scholarship from the Czech government operating in exile (Lyon 2007, p. 832). This enabled her to enroll in the London School of Economics and to work on her second doctorate diploma. During her studies in London she met the well-known sociologist Karl Mannheim, who became her supervisor. Because of their similar cultural background they were interested in similar social issues, literature and art. Both of them were collecting information and ideas relating to her thesis while traveling across the country between different universities. In 1946 Viola Klein published her second thesis, one of her best known publications - The Feminine Character: History of an Ideology. This publication was criticized because of its ostensibly militant feminism which departed from the traditional views and values. Her encouragement of women to work if they so desired, was perceived by critics as a destructive social force, provoking destabilization and family problems. Viola worked in relatively lower status positions as editor, translator and teacher. However, she continued her research working on female employment in Great Britain (Lyon, 2007, p. 834). Starting in 1951 she collaborated with the Swedish sociologist Alva Myrdal and together they eventually published the book Women's Two Roles: Home and Work. This publication helped her to increase her involvement in international research activities. In 1964 she was offered her first academic post as lecturer in the Sociology department at the University of Reading in Great Britain. After 3 years she was promoted to senior lecturer and in 1971 to reader. In 1973, shortly after her retirement she died at the age of 65.  General overview  Viola Klein's thoughts were constructed around the meaning of a femininity concept and the social creation of a feminine character. In her first important work: The Feminine Character: History of an Ideology, she claimed that attitudes in society considered as feminine are not factual observations but preconceptions and particular subjective interpretations (Klein, Correspondence, May 30, 1942, Klein papers). Providing a question about sources of the knowledge about womanhood and examining studies from the beginning of the 19th century, she wanted to prove that ‚Äúwhat we think of specific perspectives are not guaranteed truths but the ideas subject to the influence of surrounding culture and personal bias‚Äù (Terrant 2006, p. 134). With her work Klein wanted to demonstrate that scientists, whose assumptions result from particular branches of knowledge, are not free from the social, cultural and historical climates of their time (Klein 1946, p. 30). She observed that scientific objective studies about femininity are full of stereotypes and repeat particular traits like ‚Äúpassivity, emotionally, lack of abstract interests, greater intensity of personal relationships and, an instinctive tenderness for babies‚Äù (Klein 1946, p. 164). Therefore, she wanted to define a feminine nature, using notions of social and cultural expectations (Klein 1946, p. 171) ‚ÄúKlein sought to isolate psychological influences on sex difference by excluding sex-related traits that could be attributed to social function, historic tradition and prevailing ideology‚Äù (Klein, 1946, p. 129).  Gender, sex roles and role theory  For a long time before the concept of gender was used in scientific discourse (e.g. Butler 1990; Bornstein 1995), Viola Klein considered Role Theory in her research on what is feminine (Terrant 2006, p. 148; Klein 1946). Pointing out that every individual in society occupies various social positions; Klein wrote that each position includes particular patterns of roles and behaviors (Klein 1946, p. 136). According to Klein, the process of becoming an adult is the action of learning appropriate role patterns like mother's role, teacher's role, school girl's role (Terrant 2006) and within every particular society these patterns are understood differently (Klein 1946, p. 136). ‚ÄúMale and female roles are thought to be the new members of the social group in innumerable and subtle ways almost from birth. They are reinforced by experience, example, innuendos and the various others means by which social control is usually exercised‚Äù (Klein 1946, p. 136).Starting from stereotypes about womanhood and sex-role prejudices, Klein explained that the framework in which individuals develop and which shapes the way individuals adapt is full of common belief, social opinion, and tradition (Klein 1946, p. 1). What Klein started in her research supervised by Mannheim and known as an ideology of feminine character (Klein 1946) came to be known as psychosocial orientation after 1975 and eventually subsumed into the nexus that we know today as gender. (Butler 1990). As Shira Terrant claimed, Klein's research about femininity conceptualized within Mannheim methodology - underestimated by the second-wave of feminists - in fact gave roots to this concept (Terrant 2006). Contrary to Parsons‚Äô functionalistic understanding of Role Theory and sex-roles division, Klein understood the concept more broadly, that femininity and masculinity should include also personal traits that can be more or less assigned to the opposite sex's character (Terrant 2006, p. 150) a concept later solidified in transgender and queer theory (e.g. Butler 1990; Bornstein 1995).  The Sociology of knowledge  Within Mannheim's sociology of knowledge framework (Wikipedia outline: The sociology of knowledge is the study of the relationship between human and the social context within which it arises, and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies) and its standpoint to understand how ‚Äúindividuals give meaning to their ongoing reality within context [that is] structured by specific institutions [and how] social values structure our perception, give legitimacy to certain ways of seeing the world, and give moral credence to particular patterns of relationships‚Äù (Farganias, p. 12-13) reality is understood by individuals within institutionally structured frameworks. Klein was the first who used Mannheim's theory and applied it to studies about a particular subject: femininity (Terrant 2006). Concerning the social world, ‚ÄúMannheim‚Äôs perspective required the thinker to look for ways of interpreting the situation more clearly and productively‚Äù (Terrant 2006). Within this exposure and conceptualization of social reality this way of examining reality can provide motivation for women's emancipation. Political thought of women (connecting gender, race, & nationality) Klein considered the problem of social construction of the feminine more widely, women and men of one society being participants of two cultural systems and in regards to hegemonic norms, one is dominant to the other (Klein 1946, p. 174). In this context, Klein understood that women have a secondary status like particular discriminated groups in society, for example black Americans, Jews or immigrants (Terrant 2006, p. 171). What she believed to be the most challenging for women was that they ‚Äúinternalized the sense of secondary status‚Äù (Klein 2006, p. 174), thus many accepted their own suppression. Klein called this phenomenon ‚Äúa collective inferiority complex‚Äù (Terrant 2006, p. 152) which she saw as analogous to other minority groups (Klein 1942). For Klein, the reason for women's conformity and acceptance of their secondary status, are social attitudes manifested in powerful institutions of sex-roles, power and dominance-submission relations, and group prejudices (Terrant 2006, p. 152). The problem with the change of women's situations, according to her, was the strong character of stereotypes which are socially reproduced and carried from generation to generation enduring in people's minds (Terrant 2006, p. 153).  Viola Klein and Karl Mannheim  During the period that Klein knew Karl Mannheim, he was a good friend and a mentor to her. His theory of the sociology of knowledge as well as his scientific modus operandi greatly influenced Klein (Tarrant 2006). Both were refugees from the Nazi regime, they first encountered each other in the London School of Economics, where Mannheim helped and guided Klein in the process of earning her second doctorate, this time in sociology. At first naming her thesis ‚ÄúFeminism and Antifeminism: A Study in Ideologies and Social Attitudes‚Äù, by the time of its completion in 1944 and its publication in 1946 the title and subject had changed to The Feminine Character: History of an Ideology (Tarrant 2006, 137).  The Feminine Character - History of an Ideology The book The Feminine Character: History of an Ideology [first published in 1946, second edition in 1971] is the second major thesis of Viola Klein. This work is introduced with a foreword by Karl Mannheim where he explains that the question of the feminine character cannot be reached with only one field of study; for instance he said that we can find this topic in ‚Äúbiology, philosophy, psycho-analysis, experimental psychology, psychometrics, history, literary history, anthropology and sociology.‚Äù (p. vii). All these fields of knowledge have their own rules of research, with different results but complementarity of themes and utilities. According to Mannheim ‚ÄúAll of the social sciences have a common method to - the understanding of human behavior; a common method the quantitative analysis of behavior records; and a common aspiration - to devise ways of experimenting upon behavior.‚Äù (p. xii). In this foreword, he argues in favor of Viola Klein's intentions which had been criticized by other authors. To him she took old research not to plagiarize, but to give rise to another outlook. He explains that she tried to create new questioning based on already completed research in different fields of studies. In the preface to the second edition, Viola Klein responds to criticism from other authors, especially sociologists who reproach her for a lack of own research and sociological studies. The writer Rosa Macaulay, was one such critic who accused her of using ‚Äúsecondary sources‚Äù instead of doing ‚Äúoriginal research‚Äù (p. xv). Viola Klein explains that the universal theme that is the feminine role deserves to be constantly re-examined and matched with old and new studies, because scholars‚Äô ways of thinking guide our understandings of society more subjectively than objectively, regardless of the empirical framework. Given the universal theme of women and femininity she argues looking at the historical background of the social status of women, to see and compare feminine traits according to politics, socio-economics, and epochs, is perennially useful to social scientists, if not lay thinkers in general. ‚ÄúThe feminine character‚Äù is her a psycho-sociological term to label ‚Äúfemininity‚Äù as a ‚Äúpsychosexual orientation‚Äù (p. xvii). This idea of psychosexual orientation comes from biology where the feminine character is only defined by the physiological sex concept. From this point of view Klein wanted to show how Role Theory has been developed. This theory is not about ‚Äúsex roles‚Äù but more about male and female behavior, ‚Äútemperament‚Äù that the society assigns to them. Even though her book was criticized for the way she researched and wrote, it helped develop the psychometric method. The aim of her book was the ‚Äúclarification of the idea of ‚Äúfemininity‚Äù (p. 1). Some main questions about the evolution of new women's roles and traits, structure Viola Klein's thesis: What is the new ideal of femininity? What are the effects on women's personality and how are they represented and considered by other social groups? Trying to answer these issues, the book shows that as long as society's expectations are changing, the feminine character will change in shape. Comparing different research demonstrates that the scientific knowledge has directly or indirectly influenced the ‚Äúgeneral trend of intellectual and emotional development.‚Äù This influence by sciences is called ‚Äúthe mental climate‚Äù (p. 2). She especially notes the difference between scientific and social knowledge. In regards to sociology for example it is difficult to determine the ‚Äútruth‚Äù when constructing an analysis. Scholars are heavily influenced by their social and cultural backgrounds which add to the subjectivity found in sociology. Scientific knowledge relies on such pragmatic instruments for analysis like theorems and formulas. That's why she mentions that relativism is avoided as long as possible. Some contexts are given to conform with research on: ‚Äú(a) the status of women in a given society; (b) the prevailing ideologies concerning women in a certain historical period, and (c) the author‚Äôs personal attitudes towards women.‚Äù (p. 3-4). The masculine standards influencing society situate women as an ‚Äúoutgroup‚Äù. This term describes implicitly the unequal strata of society. The concept of ‚Äúoutgroup‚Äù is based on ‚Äúphysical characteristics, historical tradition, social role and different process of socialization.‚Äù (p. 4). Some turning points began the process of emancipation of women and their roles inside the social group that they are assigned to in societies. The first one was the Industrial Revolution; technological changes and surges in demand for labor implied that physical strength or traditional forms of labor no longer defined who could be productive. Then World War II led women to take on both male and female types of work, because only men were sent to fight and die, while women were left to maintain society and families (in both care and economic stability). Moreover, the capitalist ideology, itself supported by the spreading of democracy during the second part of the twentieth century, celebrated women's emancipation as labor was the engine of production, and more laborers meant more profits. The democracy ideology extols the equality between all human beings. Thus this thought reevaluates the role of the woman in society. Democratic institutions inevitably lead to enfranchisement. Also to be noted is that development led to the size of families decreasing, meaning that women had less (second shift) work to do in the family. All of these changes lead to a shift in how society views women. \\"Owing, presumably, to the emotional character of philanthropic work and to the absence of pecuniary profit attaching to it, it did not seem ‚Äúimproper‚Äù for women of standing to engage in charitable activities, and soon we find ladies of rank and consequence running charity organizations, working for prison reform, collecting rent in the slums of the East End of London, embarking on propaganda for the abolition of slavery, against cruelty to children, against alcoholism and prostitution, and for the emancipation of women. The social history of the nineteenth century is full of women pioneers in all fields of social reform.\\" (p.17).  Women's Two Roles  This book was co-written by Alva Myrdal and Viola Klein, and supported by the International Federation of University of Women (IFUW) ‚Äúto make an international survey of the needs for social reforms if women are to be put into a position to reconcile family and professional life‚Äù (p. IX). The method was essentially questionnaires distributed by the IFUW in developed countries (USA, UK, France and Sweden). Women's roles had been changing for many decades. They shifted from a paradigm of ‚ÄúWhat can women do?‚Äù to ‚Äúwhat should women do ?‚Äù (p. xi). Women are thought to be the strong link between family and the human role of ‚Äúcontinuation of the race‚Äù (p. xi). Here, there have been two conflicting roles since the industrial revolution: taking part in societal roles of economic and even political natures, and having home roles of caring and household management. Both roles were formerly situated within household which were both the main centers of family care and economic production. After the industrial revolution society needs to ‚Äúregenerate itself‚Äù (p. xii) perpetually, because development and progress demand that women continue in the economic sphere as they had in former times, but this takes them out of the household and into the factory or office. Many different cultural- institutional traditions, e.g. Christianity, Islam, Communism and National Socialism, have divergent ideologies for the role(s) of women. The women's social revolution took place in two main phases; the first one being the acceptance of women in a larger variety of jobs that were formerly restricted to ‚Äúmasculine jobs‚Äù (p. 1), and the second being ‚Äúthe growing number of women [combining] family and employment‚Äù (p. 1). Before the Industrial Revolution, women had an economic function within the family; they weren't working in a company but instead at home, crafting clothes, baking bread, making soap, raising the family (p. 4). After the industrial revolution, the economic function shifted to companies, this fueled not working as ‚Äúa high standard of living‚Äù for women to define their upper class statuses. During this period, publications were released measuring comparative aptitudes and traits of men and women. Psychologists and sociologists proved that women and men were not so different and if a man tended to be stronger for example, a woman was more agile. This process had been accelerated by both the World Wars, women had a huge importance in economic capital when men were fighting on the battlefield. After these wars, women had more favorable positions in economic progress: ‚ÄúOur society has begun to accept the fact that women are in jobs to stay‚Äù (p. 4). With it also came the emancipation of women with the right to vote, to work, and to education. The right to vote earned after World War I in the US, UK, Sweden and after World War II in France (p. 7) meant women were now political equals as well. The right to education allowed access to a larger range of fields like medicine formerly restricted to males. The right to work finally claimed by women ‚Äúto regain position in the economic productivity and sense of social usefulness, the restitution of their lost share (‚Ä¶) Work moved out of the home, women wanted to move after it‚Äù (p. 7). The second phase of this social revolution had two major developments; ‚Äúthe increased average life-expectancy‚Äù and ‚Äúthe change of the size and structure of the family‚Äù (p. 13). Better hygienic conditions in societies and massive increases in medical knowledge and technology led to infant mortality decreasing greatly between 1850 and 1950 coupled with longer life expectancy, with averages crossing 70 years of age whereas ‚Äúone half of female population died before the age of 45‚Äù (p. 7) a hundred years before. Over the decades the average family size shrank. While in Victorian times, families had more than 5 children, the average was between 2 and 5 children in 1920 (p. 20) and in 1951 the proportion of women under 50 who had more than 5 children was merely 4,4% (p. 23). Myrdal and Klein predicted that families in the future would have an average of three children. Moreover, the interval between marriage and the first child should be two years and between every birth there should be a space of two years. If a woman got married at 22, the period of motherhood would be around 10 years ‚Äúafter which her expectation of life would be a further 40 years‚Äù (p. 24), a large period ripe with opportunities for other productive activities. Also there was a new development in the family structure; daughters were leaving home at the same time as sons, demanding independence that is ‚Äúhigh in our scale of social value‚Äù (p. 25) to go to university, look for a job, and pursue independence. Daughters were not leaving home anymore just because they were getting married. Today there exist two spheres of work and home. The equilibrium between the demands of the community and the needs of individuals was more stable in former times when these spheres shared the same geographic location by family (p. 29), ‚Äúfamilies work and leisure were shared much more evenly between men and women‚Äù, leading to an asymmetric but more efficient partnership (p. 29). With the industrial revolution, things changed; the sphere of work was created and belonged to men while the home sphere was ‚Äúthe woman‚Äôs world‚Äù (p. 28). But when women got access to education, work, etc. the home role ‚Äúshould be done jointly by men and women if the ideal of a happy home is to become a reality‚Äù (p. 29). Nevertheless, a majority of men enjoyed using their leisure time to accomplish some work-hobbies at home, becoming an amateur painter, carpenter, etc. while women still took on the lion's share of household duties. The authors separate a woman's adulthood into three phases. The first one is a step that lasts around 7‚Äì10 years in European countries and 5 years in the USA. It corresponds to the first years in adulthood, after school but before marriage. Only a few will stay in this phase corresponding to women who don't get married. In European countries 82% of women in this phase were working whereas it fell down to 51% in the USA. In this phase women are living a kind of ‚Äúman‚Äôs life‚Äù before their marriage; they are independent. When getting married the second phase of woman's adulthood begins, motherhood. Due to child rearing, the home becomes their workplace. The weekly work load for a housewife rises depending on the number of children: an average of 56 hrs with no children and up to 78 hrs for three. The crucial fact described is that for working women the weekly work load in both spheres is 84 hrs with no children and 85 hrs with three, which goes to show the result of the combined strain of both spheres of life. Afterwards women enter the third phase of adulthood, when their children grow up and leave home. A period of crisis can follow, the housewife is now alone, she does not have as much to do at home as before and looking for a job at 40 is complicated. ‚ÄúThe traditional stereotype is still at work in the minds of women themselves, making them believe that they are much older and much less capable than they in fact are‚Äù (p. 40). The authors noticed sex divisions were different in observed countries except in nursing and teaching. Pharmacology and dentistry in France and Sweden became feminine fields of work. In the US, it was in finance, insurance and real estates (44% of women in UK work in this field) (p. 76). These conditions resulted from local conditions and traditions. One thing the authors were sure about was that the choice made by women was ‚Äústrongly influenced by the role they hope to play in family‚Äù (p. 77). In the future women will constitute a good portion of the labor market and it will permit women to soon do ‚Äúmore heart-searching when choosing a career‚Äù (p. 156) and obviously it is still important that they continue to fight for equality of rights between men and women.

He started his professional career as a research assistant in International Law at the University of Parma. Early activities While at university, Roberto Savio acted as an international officer with Italy‚Äôs National Student Association and the Youth Movement of Italy‚Äôs Christian Democracy party, eventually taking on responsibility for Christian Democracy‚Äôs relations with developing countries. After leaving university, he became international press chief for former Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro. After the 1973 Chilean coup d‚Äôetat, Roberto Savio left Italian politics to pursue journalism. Early journalistic career Roberto Savio‚Äôs career in journalism began with Italian daily ‚ÄòIl Popolo‚Äô and he went on to become Director for News Services for Latin America with RAI, Italy‚Äôs state broadcasting company. He received a number of awards for TV documentaries, including the Saint-Vincent Award for Journalism, the most prestigious journalism award in Italy. Inter Press Service (IPS) Throughout his student years, Roberto Savio had cultivated an interest in analysing and explaining the huge information and communication gap that existed between the North and the South of the world, particularly Latin America. Together with Argentine journalist Pablo Piacentini, he decided to create a press agency that would permit Latin American exiles in Europe to write about their countries for a European audience. That agency, which was known in the early days as Roman Press Agency, was the seed for what was to become the Inter Press Service (IPS) news agency, which was formally established at a meeting in the Schloss Eichholz conference centre of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation (the foundation of the CDU), in Wesseling near Bonn, then the capital city of West Germany. From the outset, it was decided that IPS would be a non-profit cooperative of journalists and its statute declared that two-thirds of the members should come from the South. Roberto Savio gave IPS its unique mission ‚Äì ‚Äúgiving a voice to the voiceless‚Äù ‚Äì acting as a communication channel that privileges the voices and the concerns of the poorest and creates a climate of understanding, accountability and participation around development, promoting a new international information order between the South and the North. The agency grew rapidly throughout the 1970s and 1980s until the dramatic events of 1989-91 ‚Äì the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union ‚Äì prompted new goals and definitions: IPS was the first news outlet to identify itself as ‚Äúglobal‚Äù and define the new concept of neoliberal globalisation as contributing to the distancing of developing countries from wealth, trade and policy-making. IPS offers communication services to improve South‚ÄìSouth cooperation and South- North exchanges and carries out projects with international partners to open up communication channels to all social sectors. IPS has been recognised by the United Nations and granted NGO consultative status (category I) with ECOSOC. With the strengthening of the process of globalisation, IPS has dedicated itself to global issues, becoming the news agency for global civil society: more than 30,000 NGOs subscribe to its services, and several million people are readers of its online services. Under Roberto Savio, IPS won the Washington-based Population Institute‚Äôs ‚Äúmost conscientious news service‚Äù award nine time in the 1990s, beating out the major wire services year in and year out. Population Institute Names 2007 Global Media Award Winners IPS won FAO‚Äôs A.H. Boerma Award for journalism in 1997 http://www.fao.org/fao- awards/ah-boerma-award/en/ for its \\"significant contribution to covering sustainable agriculture and rural development in more than 100 countries, filling the information gap between developed and developing countries by focusing on issues such as rural living, migration, refugees and the plight of women and children\\". On the initiative of Roberto Savio, IPS established the International Journalism Award in 1985 to honour outstanding journalists whose efforts, and often lives, contributed significantly to exposing human rights violations and advancing democracy, most often in developing countries. In 1991, the scope of the award was broadened to reflect the tremendous changes taking place in the world following the historic break-up of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. The Award, renamed the International Achievement Award, was given in recognition of the work of individuals and organisations that ‚Äúcontinue to fight for social and political justice in the new world order‚Äù. Roberto Savio is now President Emeritus of IPS and Chairman of the IPS Board of Trustees, which also includes former U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, former Portuguese President Mario Soares, former UNESCO Director-General Federico Mayor Zaragoza, former Finnish President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Martti Ahtisaari, former Costa Rican President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Oscar Arias and former Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifue. After stepping down as Director-General of IPS, Roberto Savio has continued his interest in ‚Äúalternative‚Äù communication and information, founding Other News as an international non-governmental association of people concerned about the decline of the information media. Other News In 2008, Roberto Savio launched the online Other News service to provide ‚Äúinformation that markets eliminate‚Äù. Other News publishes reports that have already appeared in niche media but not in mass circulation media, in addition to opinions and analyses from research centres, universities and think tanks ‚Äì material that is intended to give readers access to news and opinion that they will not find in their local newspapers but which they might wish to read ‚Äúas citizens who care about a world free from the pernicious effects of today‚Äôs globalisation‚Äù. Other News also distributes daily analysis on international issues, particularly the themes of global governance and multilateralism, to several thousand policy-makers and leaders of civil society, in both English and Spanish. Communication initiatives An internationally renowned expert in communications issues, Roberto Savio has helped launched numerous communication and information projects, always with an emphasis on the developing world. Among others, Roberto Savio helped launch the National Information Systems Network (ASIN) for Latin America and the Caribbean, the UNESCO-sponsored Agencia Latinoamericana de Servicios Especiales de Informacion [Latin American Special Information Services Agency] (ALASEI), and the Women‚Äôs Feature Service (WFS), initially an IPS service and now an independent NGO with headquarters in New Delhi. He also founded the Technological Information Promotion System (TIPS), a major U.N. project to implement and foster technological and economic cooperation among developing countries, and he developed Women into the New Network for Entrepreneurial Reinforcement (WINNER), a TIPS training project aimed at educating and empowering small and medium woman entrepreneurs in developing countries. The activities of TIPS are currently carried by the executing agency, Development Information Network (DEVNET), an international association which Roberto Savio helped create and which has been recognised by the United Nations as an NGO holding consultative status (category I) with the U.N. Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). Roberto Savio has also been actively involved in promoting exchanges between regional information services, such as between ALASEI and the Organisation of Asian News Agencies (OANA) now known as the Organisation of Asia-Pacific News Agencies, and between the PanAfrican News Agency (PANA) and the Federation of Arab News Agencies (FANA). Roberto Savio was instrumental in placing the concept of a Development Press Bulletin Service Tariff on the agenda of UNESCO‚Äôs International Commission for the Study of Communication Problems (MacBride Commission). Roberto Savio has also worked closely in the field of information and communication with many United Nations organisations, including the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Children‚Äôs Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR).

It is a slim, translucent thallose liverwort forming yellow-green mats of branches about 1mm wide. Description Metzgeria furcata has a midrib which is clearly visible over the rest of the thallus (which is 1mm wide), which also extends to the tip of the thallus, although without an excurrent nerve. The defining characteristic is definitely the fact that the thalli and the midrib fork at the end, which is visible on most patches. The Forked Veilwort rarely makes sporophytes, although on the underside of quite a few patches an inflorescence can be found.

He is known primarily for his blanket-wrapped Southern Plains figures and depiction of Kiowa folklore. Redbird worked in several media but is most well known for having accomplished his works with an airbrush. Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry declared June 7, 2003, as \\"Robert Redbird Day\\" to celebrate the artist's many creative and humanitarian achievements. Early life Redbird was born in Lawton, Oklahoma, in 1939. His grandparents on his father's side raised him from birth after his parents rejected him due to his suffering from epilepsy. His grandmother was of Hispanic descent and his grandfather of Kiowa descent. He was raised at his grandparents' farm in Gotebo, Oklahoma in Kiowa County. Redbird's grandfather, Monroe Tsatoke, was a member of the Kiowa Six, an important cohort of painters who popularized Southern Plains Flatstyle painting. Inspired by Tsatoke, At Redbird started practicing his own skills at eight years old. When Redbird was 16, he sold his first piece of artwork to a doctor in Carnegie, Oklahoma, and gave the proceeds to his grandmother for groceries. Education Redbird was sent to Fort Sill Indian School by his parents in his teenage years. At Fort Sill, Redbird joined the Indian Art Club where he began to develop his work even more. Redbird studied art in Santa Fe until he left in the late 1960s. He also went to Okmulgee Tech where he learned skills such as welding that he used to create metal sculptures. Being an ordained minister, Redbird took the commandment, \\"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image\\" to heart and did not spend much time creating these sculptures. Notable works and style Redbird's work has allowed him to travel the world. In 1967, Redbird designed the poster for the US International Open Polo Game tournament, which allowed him the opportunity to meet Charles, Prince of Wales. Redbird's work features Kiowa culture, history, stories, and legends passed down to him by his grandfather and by William Tenedah (his wife's grandfather). Robert works in several media, including oil, acrylics, watercolor, gouache, pencil, pastel, pen & ink, and prints. Humanitarian efforts Redbird financially supported a summer camp for handicapped children when he lived in Scottsdale, Arizona. Redbird sold his paintings for these camps that would take the children on field trips and afford them experiences that they would not have otherwise. The most money he raised for the kids totaled $56,000, with contributions coming from all over. Achievements and awards Redbird has worked in many different capacities in his life. He has worked as a welder, mechanic, auto body repairman & painter, a Pentecostal minister, a gospel singer, commercial artist, lecturer, and painter. He also served as a cultural consultant on several motion pictures, including the 1990 film, Dances With Wolves.

It is a platform for young talent to build up their career readiness through internships and graduate jobs; developing skill sets required in different careers. The company was founded in August 2013 by Oswald Yeo, Looi Qin En and Seah Ying Cong. The website was launched in January 2014. Wong Yong Jie and Steve Anderson Sutanto joined and cofounded the technology team and Indonesia business respectively in 2014 and 2015. Through the website, users can apply for internships, full-time, part-time or project based positions with partnered companies. The website targets job hunters aged 16 to 26. Some major companies registered with Glints include Adidas and Puma. Glints is looking to expand operations beyond Singapore to other countries in the region and the larger US market. History of Glints The company was founded by Oswald Yeo, Looi Qin En and Seah Ying Cong, who met back in high school, Hwa Chong Institution. Aged 22, 21 and 21 respectively, they were the youngest entrepreneurs in the Joyful Frog Digital Incubator (JFDI) program. Wong Yong Jie and Steve Sutanto joined and cofounded the technology team and Indonesia business respectively in 2014 and 2015. They discovered that there are 75 million unemployed young people worldwide and many employers are struggling to fill entry-level vacancies. Glints sought to bridge this mismatch between employer needs and young, skilled talent. Initially, Glints began by assisting their friends' search for internships by building up their career readiness through practical & real-world experiences. In August 2013 glints started off with 38 people in google spreadsheets and as of April 2015 it had grown to over 7000 active members. The trio have put their computer science degrees and scholarships on hold at Stanford, University of California Berkeley, and Wharton Business School respectively, in order to pursue the business. Glints' mission is to bridge the gap between education and employment by being a professional platform for young people focused on career discovery and development. In 2017, Looi Qin En left the company, citing \\"creative friction\\". Meanwhile, its revenue grew by 60% and user growth doubled quarter-on-quarter in 2017. Funding Glints is an alumnus of accelerator Joyful Frog Digital Incubator (JFDI.Asia). In 2014 Glints had received US$59,940 in pre-seed money from private business angels and JFDI. On October 20, 2014, Glints managed to secure $475,000 in an oversubscribed seed round from venture capitalists, led by East Ventures, with participation from 500 Startups, Infocomm Investments, Darius Cheung, John Tan, SPH Media Fund, 8 Capital and Pix Vine Capital. These funds will be used to grow its engineering team to develop the platform. According to co-founder Oswald Yeo, they have turned away about US$250,000 as they \\"didn't want to raise so much money right now\\". In February 2018, Singapore-listed recruitment firm HRnetGroup Limited made a strategic investment in Glints. In July 2019, Glints managed to secure $6.8 million in a Series B round led by Monk's Hill Ventures. Features User profile Glints allows users to create profiles to showcase their relevant skills and experiences. Skills can be certified when users demonstrate proficiency in the skills to a minimum standard, although the feature is currently in beta as of May 2015.http://www.glints.com/support To complete the profile, users can upload their resumes and their own photos to aid in identification. The account can then be used to source for relevant job opportunities using the various available filters. Job listings Employers create job postings and describe their needs and skill requirements. They are segregated into different industry functions and could be filtered with the industry filter function. Users can further narrow their search down to four different types of position, namely, internships, full-time, part-time and project-based type of jobs. Prospective employers are then able to receive applications from users and review each application individually; Glints uses a mix of human and algorithmic screening to bring companies quality candidates. Glints DNA profiling test The Glints DNA profiling test was developed by Looi Qin En, one of the co-founders. The test helps in profiling the personalities of interns. The test was developed and a test group of 50 people were asked to take the test and then asked to do established personality tests such as DISC and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator as well. The results were compared in order to draw correlation and similarities. One of the key features of this test was that the number of questions were reduced from the usual 50-100 to 10. Business model the business model side of things, Glints will only charge employers once they contact a potential match. Alternatively, companies can also pay a monthly subscription fee to access Glints‚Äô entire database of jobseekers. Future developments and expansion The company is working on a key feature called the ‚Äúdynamic skills tree‚Äù. It works by recommending career paths to users based on their indicated interest. Each career path comes with a \\"skill tree\\" that shows projects, internships, and courses he can take. Once completed, these stints will reflect on his Glints profile, which employers can discover and then reach out to the person for an interview. Glints has plans to expand to the larger American market, with plans to settle in Blk 71 San Francisco as a member of the pioneer batch of occupants, using it as a base to further their venture through building their network in this space first. Reception Within the first three months, the firm has gained revenue of US$10,000. It has over 800 intern accounts and 200 internship petitions from various companies. Line, Goldlion and Puma are hiring interns through Glints Intern. It is currently in talks with financial giant Goldman Sachs to discuss the possibility of using the portal to hire future interns as well. Glints Intern was one of the top 50 startups listed to attend Echelon Ignite in Singapore. The trio made a pitch at the Singapore Echelon 2014 Satellite. The team though missed the coveted ‚Äúwinner‚Äù rank, but it certainly has managed to catch the eye of investors. The company claims that it has been approached by angel investors who are keen to pool in seed capital into the company, mainly because of the traction and the vision of the company.

His campaign for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 election was his first campaign as a Democrat, after having previously been elected senator as a Republican, and governor as an independent. He received zero votes either formally or by write-in, meaning he got the fewest votes of any major party candidate in the Democratic or Republican Primaries 2016. Background  Political career in Rhode Island  Chafee's father, John Chafee, was the senior United States Senator from Rhode Island, who had intended to retire, and not seek reelection in 2000; Lincoln had intended to run to win his father's seat the same year. On October 24, 1999, John Chafee died, and Republican Governor Lincoln Almond appointed his son, then a Republican to fill the vacancy of his Republican father. Due to the proximity between his appointment and the scheduled election in 2000, no special election was called. Chafee was elected to his seat outright with a large majority. Having been seen as the most liberal Republican senator, Chafee was faced with a tough primary battle against Steve Laffey in 2006, which he won by a 54 to 46 percent margin. His battle with Laffey in the primary excessively drained his campaign funds. Chafee lost to Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse, and was one of six Republican seats lost when Democrats regained their majority in the midterm elections of 2006. After his Senate loss, Chafee left the Republican Party, saying, \\"it's not my party anymore\\". After a hiatus following his loss, he announced his candidacy for Governor of Rhode Island; in a seven-way race, Chafee won the governorship with 36 percent of the vote. Having previously indicated the possibility that he might run for re-election for Governor as a Democrat, Chafee officially joined the Democratic Party on May 30, 2013. He chose against running for re- election in 2014.  Presidential politics  In the 2008 presidential election, he formally endorsed the Democratic nominee Barack Obama. In 2012, Chafee was one of 35 co-chairs selected to serve on President Barack Obama's re-election campaign. On April 9, 2015, Chafee announced that he had formed an exploratory committee in preparation for a potential candidacy for the Democratic Party's 2016 presidential nomination. The following month, on May 29, it was confirmed that Chafee would announce his decision regarding a 2016 presidential bid on June 3.Foley, Elise (May 29, 2015) \\"Lincoln Chafee to announce presidential run on June 3\\", Politico.

Debate performance Chafee participated in the first of the Democratic primary debates on October 13, 2015. Many felt the format favored the predominant candidates Clinton and Sanders, who received much more time than the others. In addition, Chafee was repeatedly interrupted by moderator Anderson Cooper. His performance was widely panned by voters and commentators alike, primarily citing his poor responses to questions regarding how he voted while in the Senate, as well as changing his party affiliation multiple times. In the aftermath of the debate, Chafee's candidacy was further discredited by pundits, with some even describing it as \\"futile.\\" His performance was mocked by \\"Saturday Night Live,\\" which portrayed him as a bumbling space cadet. \\"Good night America, bye forever,\\" his doppelg√§nger said with a wave.Chafee withdraws from race NYTimes, October 23, 2015 Withdrawal Following a poor debate performance, low polling numbers and paltry fundraising, Chafee announced on October 23, 2015 that he would be suspending his campaign.

It was formalized in April 2015, when the Ukrainian government approved laws that outlawed communist symbols. On 15 May 2015, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko signed a set of laws that started a six- month period for the removal of communist monuments (excluding World War II monuments) and renaming of public places named after communist-related themes. At the time, this meant that 22 cities and 44 villages were set to get a new name. Until 21 November 2015, municipal governments had the authority to implement this; if they failed to do so, the provincial authorities had until 21 May 2016 to change the names.

By 16 December 2015, these three parties were banned in Ukraine; however, the Communist Party of Ukraine appealed the ban; this meant the court's decision to ban the party did not come into force. However, the April 2015 decommunization law contains a norm that allows the Ministry of Justice to prohibit the Communist Party from participating in elections. History In March 2014 Lenin Square in Dnipropetrovsk was renamed \\"Heroes of Maidan Square\\" in honor of the people killed during Euromaidan and the statue was removed. Two years later, in May 2016, the city was renamed Dnipro. Pulling down the statue of Lenin in Kharkiv on 28 September 2014. An unofficial decommunization process started in Ukraine after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and the following independence of Ukraine. Although decommunization was carried out much more ruthlessly and visibly in the (former Soviet Union's) Baltic States and the former Warsaw Pact countries outside the Soviet Union.Ukraine toppled communist statues but raised a bigger debate, Washington Post (13 August 2015) Ukraine's first president after the country's 1991 independence from the Soviet Union, Leonid Kravchuk, had also issued orders aimed at \\"de-sovietisation\\" in the early 1990s. The following years, although at a slow rate, historical monuments to Soviet leaders were removed in Ukraine. But this process went on much further in the Ukrainian-speaking western regions than in the industrialised, largely Russian-speaking eastern regions. Decommunization laws were drafted in the Ukrainian parliament in 2002, 2005, 2009, 2011 and 2013, but they all failed to materialize.Ukrainian PM leads charge to erase Soviet history, Politico (27 April 2015) During and after Euromaidan, starting with the fall of the monument to Lenin in Kyiv on 8 December 2013, several Lenin monuments and statues were removed or destroyed by protesters. In April 2014, a year before the formal, nationwide decommunization process in Ukraine local authorities removed and altered communist symbols and place names, as in Dnipropetrovsk. On 9 April 2015, the Ukrainian parliament passed legislation on decommunization. It was submitted by the Second Yatsenyuk Government, banning the promotion of symbols of \\"Communist and National Socialist totalitarian regimes\\". One of the main provisions of the bill was the recognition of the Soviet Union was \\"criminal\\" and one that it \\"pursued a state terror policy\\". The legislation prohibits the use of Communist symbols and propaganda and also bans all symbols and propaganda of national-socialism and its values and any activities of Nazi or fascist groups in Ukraine. The ban applies to monuments, place and street names. The ban does not apply to World War II monuments and when symbols are located in a cemetery. Expressing pro-communist views was not made illegal. The ban on communist symbols did result in the removal of hundreds of statues, the replacement of millions of street signs and the renaming of populated places including some of Ukraine's biggest cities like Dnipro. The city administration of Dnipro estimated in June 2015 that 80 streets, embankments, squares, and boulevards would have to be renamed.Ukraine's Dnipro Digs In To Complex Decommunization Process, Radio Free Europe (11 June 2015) Maxim Eristavi of Hromadske.TV estimated late April 2015 that the nationwide renaming would cost around $1.5 billion. The legislation also granted special legal status to veterans of the \\"struggle for Ukrainian independence\\" from 1917 to 1991 (the lifespan of the Soviet Union). The same day, the parliament also passed a law that replaced the term \\"Great Patriotic War\\" in the national lexicon with \\"World War II\\" from 1939 to 1945, a change of great significance since during the initial part of World War II the USSR was in a pact with Germany and invaded six countries in coordination with its Nazi co-aggressor. On 15 May 2015 President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko signed the Decommunisation Laws.Poroshenko signed the laws about decomunization. Ukrayinska Pravda. 15 May 2015 Poroshenko signs laws on denouncing Communist, Nazi regimes, Interfax-Ukraine. 15 May 2015 This started a six-month period for the removal of communist monuments and renaming of public places named after communist-related themes. The Ukrainian decommunization law applies, but is not limited to: * the Flag of the Soviet Union * the Flag of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and its 14 other republics * the State Emblem of the Soviet Union and its constituent republics as well as the socialist countries of Eastern Europe * the State Anthem of the Soviet Union and the republics * the Red star * the Hammer and sickle * images bearing the likeness of Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin * military uniforms The laws were published in Holos Ukrayiny on 20 May 2015; this made them come into force officially the next day. On 3 June 2015 the Ukrainian Institute of National Memory published a list of 22 cities and 44 villages subject to renaming. By far most of these places were in the Donbass region in East Ukraine; the others were situated in Central Ukraine and South Ukraine. In Ukraine rename 22 cities and 44 villages, Ukrayinska Pravda (4 June 2015) Under the Decommunisation Laws the municipal governments had until 21 November 2015 to change the name of the settlement they govern. For settlements that failed to rename, the provincial authorities had until 21 May 2016 to change the name. If after that date the settlement still retained its old name the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine renamed the settlement. In a 24 July 2015 decree based on the decommunization laws, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry stripped the Communist Party of Ukraine, Communist Party of Ukraine (renewed) and Communist Party of Workers and Peasants of their right to participate in elections and it stated it was continuing the court actions (that started in July 2014) to end the registration of Ukraine's communist parties. On 30 September 2015 the District Administrative Court in Kyiv banned the parties Communist Party of Workers and Peasants and Communist Party of Ukraine (renewed); they both did not appeal. In October 2015, a statue of Lenin in Odessa was converted into a statue of Star Wars villain Darth Vader. On 16 December 2015, the Kyiv District Administrative Court validated the claim of the Ministry of Justice in full, banning the activities of the Communist Party of Ukraine. The party appealed this ban at the European Court of Human Rights. In March 2016, statues of Lenin, Felix Dzerzhinsky, Sergey Kirov and a Komsomol monument were removed or taken down in the eastern city of Zaporizhia. The statue overlooking the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station (formerly named Lenin Dam) was the largest remaining Lenin statue in Ukraine. On 19 May 2016, the Ukrainian parliament voted to rename Ukraine's fourth- largest city Dnipropetrovsk to \\"Dnipro\\".

Director of the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance Volodymyr Viatrovych stated in February 2018 that \\"De-communism in the context of depriving the symbols of the totalitarian regime has actually been completed\\". De-communism in Ukraine is actually completed - Vyatrovich, Ukrayinska Pravda (10 February 2018) Although according to him the city of Kyiv was lagging behind. In February 2019 the Central Election Commission of Ukraine refused to register the candidacy of (leader of Communist Party) Petro Symonenko for the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election due to the fact that the statute, name and symbolism of the Communist Party of Ukraine did not comply with the 2015 decommunization laws. The CEC refused to register nearly fifty presidential candidates, Ukrayinska Pravda (8 February 2019) Symenko appealed the decision, but the court of appeal confirmed decision of the Central Election Commission of Ukraine. During the same month of February, it was announced that the oblast of Dnipropetrovsk would be renamed to \\"Sicheslav\\" in the future. On 16 July 2019 the Constitutional Court of Ukraine upheld the 2015 Ukrainian decommunization laws. Criticism On 18 May 2015 the OSCE expressed concern that the laws could negatively impact the freedom of the press in Ukraine. The OSCE also regretted what it perceived as a lack of opportunity of civil society to participate in public discussions about the laws. The Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group stated (in May 2015) the laws \\"(one of which) effectively criminalizes public expression of views held by many Ukrainians\\".President signs dangerously flawed ‚Äòdecommunization‚Äô laws, Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group (16 May 2015) Russian lawmakers have claimed (in April 2015) it was \\"cynical\\" to put on a par Communist and Nazi symbols, and the pro-Russian rebels of the War in Donbass (a region in eastern Ukraine) condemned the new law. The head of the rebels Donetsk People's Republic Alexander Zakharchenko stated late February 2016 that when renamed cities \\"will return under our jurisdiction\\" they would be renamed to its pre- decommunizated name. Zakharchenko wants to capture and rename decommunizated cities of Donbass, Ukrayinska Pravda (25 February 2016) In May 2015 President of Poland Bronis≈Çaw Komorowski stated that the punishment for discussing the role of Ukrainian nationalistic organizations Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists-Ukrainian Insurgent Army would be harmful to Polish-Ukrainian relations.Poroshenko vows to amend law on UPA, UNIAN (20 May 2015) On 18 December 2015 the Venice Commission stated that Ukraine's Decommunization Laws did not comply with European legislative standards.

However, the April 2015 decommunization law contains a norm that allows the Ministry of Justice to prohibit the Communist Party from participating in elections. Ukraine had 5,500 Lenin monuments in 1991, declining to 1,300 by December 2015.Out of Sight, The Ukrainian Week (28 December 2015) More than 700 Lenin monuments were removed and/or destroyed from February 2014 (when 376 came down) to December 2015.

Special forces quickly reseized the compound, killing the attackers. Overview The attack began when a suicide car bomb detonated at the gate of the Ministry of Higher Education and Ministry of Petroleum and Resources building in Mogadishu. The compound is situated near the KM4 junction, which was often used by government officials during travels to and from the country. Armed insurgents in military fatigues subsequently penetrated the premises. However, no senior government officials were on the grounds. According to witnesses, there were between two or three gunmen, who were armed with light and heavy weapons and had on suicide vests. Special Forces units arrived at the compound shortly afterwards, and quickly recaptured control of the area after a brief exchange in gunfire with the militants. Interior Minister Abdirizak Omar indicated that the security forces also rescued dozens of individuals. Additionally, a federal government spokesman stated that casualties included seven Al-Shabaab militants, eight pedestrians and two soldiers. Around 15 people were also wounded and were taken to the hospital for treatment. Al-Shabaab later claimed responsibility for the attack. Analysts suggested that the fact that the group had begun resorting to raids against soft targets reflected its structural weakness, as the militants were no longer able to mount large counterstrikes against Somali army and AMISOM positions.

Background Bennett's father, Randall L. Williams (1924-2010), was a member of the Arkansas House for Drew County, dates not available, and was a circuit judge for the 11th District from 1970 to 1993, with duties in Arkansas, Jefferson, Desha, and Lincoln counties. The Randall L. Williams Correctional Facility west of Pine Bluff in Jefferson County is named in his honor. Bennett received a bachelor's degree in Political Science from the University of Arkansas in the capital city of Little Rock and her legal degree from the University of Missouri School of Law in Columbia, Missouri. She is a member of the All Souls Church, the American Heart Association, and the Central Arkansas Rescue Efforts for Animals. She is married to Wayne Otis Bennett, Jr. (born 1948), of Lonoke. Political life Bennett is a former elected city attorney for Lonoke, with service dating back to at least 2009. In that capacity, she received a $2,000 annual retainer for attendance at council meetings and as legal counsel to the mayor and the council. Bennett narrowly overcame the statewide tide for Republicans in the general election on November 4, 2014. By 86 votes, she defeated her GOP opponent, Buddy Fisher, 4,252 votes (50.5 percent) to 4,166 (49.5 percent). Fisher had won the May 20 Republican primary with 64 percent of the votes cast over intra-party rival, Trent Eilts. The position opened when the Democrat Walls McCrary, also of Lonoke, was term-limited and could not seek a fourth term. Bennett holds these committee assignments: (1) Judiciary and (2) State Agencies and Governmental Affairs. In February 2015, Bennett opposed House Bill 1228, authored by Republican Bob Ballinger of Carroll County in northwestern Arkansas, which prohibits government from imposing a burden on the free exercise of religion. The measure passed the House, seventy-two to twenty. Bennett called for a reworking of the legislation. She claimed the Ballinger bill would establish a \\"type of religious litmus test\\" which could impact nearly any law under consideration by the legislature. The measure was subsequently signed into law in revised form, SB 975, by Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson. In March 2015, Bennett hugged to console a Republican colleague, DeAnn Vaught of Horatio in Sevier County, when Vaught spoke in support of legislation dealing with the reporting of cases of child maltreatment and referred to her own experiences regarding the issue.

It was located on the southeastern coast of the island. The site was inhabited continuously for c. 1,300 years, approximately from the 8th century BC (Geometric period) till the 6th century AD (Late Antiquity). From that time on Karthaia remained abandoned. The ruins of the acropolis, town-centre and fortifications of ancient Karthaia have been preserved for centuries on the Aspri Vigla hills, Pindar‚Äôs ‚Äúnarrow ridge of land‚Äú.Paian IV, 13-14. Two valleys, of the Kalamitsis on the east and the Vathypotamos on the west, and the sea on the south define the site completely, creating a closed unit with a beautiful natural landscape, a refuge for important populations of various species of bird-life, and a place conducive to a variety of endemic pharmaceutical and aromatic plants. Even today, Carthaea can be approached by land only on foot, walking for more or less an hour along cobbled paths, which in most cases follow the lines of ancient pathways, or by sea, by small boat, anchoring in the same place as the craft of previous periods, without the aid of modern harbour facilities.  Description of the archaeological site  The acropolis of Carthaea is surrounded by walls more than 2 kilometers long and dated to the 6th-4th centuries BC. On its lowest part two artificial terraces were constructed in order to create the necessary space for temples and public buildings. On the lower terrace, closer to the sea, there is the temple of Apollo Pythios dated to c. 530 BC. According to ancient texts it was the most important sacred building of the ancient city-state. On the terrace in front of the temple there were many dedications offered to the god, mainly statues, and the decrees of the Deme of Carthaea were put there on display. On the upper terrace there is a smaller temple from c. 500 BC dedicated to Athena,A. Papanikolaou, Œó ŒøŒπŒ∫ŒøŒ¥ŒøŒºŒπŒ∫ŒÆ Œ¥œÅŒ±œÉœÑŒ∑œÅŒπœåœÑŒ∑œÑŒ± œÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œù.

Marble architectural sculptures of this temple represented scenes of an Amazonomachy, scraps of which are kept in the Archaeological Museum of Ioulis. A classical monumental marble building, a Propylon (mid-5th century BC) marked the main entrance to this terrace and to the acropolis. A sloping stone-paved way, dated to the first half of the 5th century BC, ascended to it from the west. On the eastern side an impressive Late Archaic flight of stairs partly carved in the bedrock led to a path (‚Äúprocessional way‚Äù) which connected the upper to the lower plateau. On the upper terrace stood also another public building of uncertain function, which is called Building D (c. 300 BC).Ch. Kanellopoulos, The Classical and Hellenistic Building Phases of the Acropolis of Ancient Karthaia, Kea, Athenische Mitteilungen 118 (2003) 211-238, Plates 54-57. A monumental flight of six stairs led to a pronaos (porch) with four semi-fluted Doric columns ‚Äúin antis‚Äù; the almost square cella was paved with a mosaic floor of white sea pebbles on the three sides of a central square with purple volcanic stones and a limestone cubic base. At the foot of the slope to the Vathypotamos stream is located the stone-built theater of the ancient city, dated to the 4th century BC. It accommodated almost 1,000 people. The theater is currently under excavation and preservation works. Next to the theater an impressive complex of Roman baths have been uncovered lately. Carthaea was a significant harbor of the Cyclades in ancient times. The submerged ancient jetty (c. 160 m in length and 35 m in width) is still discernible between the two bays; it was made of rocks, slabs and pebbles and reached to the small rocky islet of the bay. At the top of the Aspri Vigla hill, where the modern church of the Theotokos of the Myrtles now stands, there was another ancient temple dedicated to an unknown deity. An Early Christian basilica lies in the bed of the Vathypotamos and is built with reused material from an ancient temple in the area, attributed to Demeter. All over the slopes of the hill were constructed the private houses of the Carthaeans, of which many walls, thresholds, heaps of stones and minor objects (pottery and tools) bear witness. In several parts of the ancient city, e.g. south of the theater, east of the Apollo temple and along the way connecting the two terraces, there are remains of cisterns and pipes for the supply of water, dated to the Hellenistic until the Late Roman period. The ancient cemetery is located outside the city-wall, in the valley of Kalamitsis. After the collapse of the ancient monuments, during the 6th and 7th centuries AD, numerous graves were dug within the ruins of the temple of Apollo, in the terrace of the temple of Athena, in the destroyed Building D and on the slope of Vathypotamos. These graves, often made by ancient architectural members in second use, are the testimony of the last inhabitants of Carthaea. The territory (the chora) of the ancient city-state of Carthaea extended over the southeastern part of the island of Keos; all over this area vestiges of numerous ancient settlements, ruins of farm sheds, of towers and traces of metallurgical activity have been detected. A network of ancient roads, which were often at a later time taken over by the traditional paths of Kea, facilitated the transport and contact of the ancient citizens.E. Simantoni-Bournia - L. Mendoni - T. Panagou, ŒöŒ±œÅŒ∏Œ±ŒØŒ±... ŒµŒªŒ±œáœçŒΩœâœÑŒøŒΩ œÉœÑŒ≠œÅŒΩŒøŒΩ œáŒ∏ŒøŒΩœåœÇ, Athens 2009.  Excavation and restoration  The fact that the ruins of Carthaea have always been visible, combined to the many references on the site in ancient texts compelled travellers to visit the area as early as the 17th century, but mostly in the 18th and 19th centuries. As no serious research had been conducted in the area till 1811, travellers identified the imposing ruins with Ioulis and situated Carthaea in the place of modern Chora, a frequent mistake marked also on maps of this period. A milestone for the investigation of Carthaea is the year 1811, when the Danish scholar and archaeologist P.O. Br√∏ndsted, guessing the importance of the site and seeking out ancient Greek artifacts, he excavated for two or three weeks with thirty local workers. The site was for the first time correctly identified with Carthaea, as the name was mentioned in ancient inscriptions found in situ.P.O. Br√∏ndsted, Voyages dans la Gr√®ce (Paris 1826). Scientific archaeological research on the ancient city started practically shortly after 1900, with the work of the Belgian archaeologist P. Graindor.P. Graindor, ¬´ Fouilles de Karthaia (√Æle de Keos) ¬ª, BCH 29, 329-361; P. Graindor, ¬´ Fouilles de Karthaia ¬ª, BCH 30, 92-102, 433-452; P. Graindor, ‚ÄúKykladika: Ceos‚Äù, MB 25, 78-125. Excavation and restoration of the monuments of Carthaea was conducted by the Greek Ministry of Culture through the Committee for the ‚ÄúConservation and Restoration of ancient Karthaia on Keos‚Äù in the years 2002-2008 and 2011-2015. The projects have been financed by the European Union. Work has been carried out on the temples of Apollo and Athena, on the Propylon, the Building D, the theater, and on their immediate surroundings.E. Simantoni-Bournia - L. Mendoni - T.

Early life and military career Walker was born February 3, 1839, in Arlington, Indiana, to James and Jane (McBride) Walker. He moved to the Fort Wayne area with his family when he was a young boy, where he attended the local schools. Walker was working as deputy warden at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City when the Civil War began. He enlisted at age 23 on August 5, 1862, in Company K, 73rd Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and was commissioned captain. Following the Battle of Stones River, Walker was promoted to major for his gallant service. In March 1863, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. Following the death of the regiment's colonel in May 1863, Walker was given command of the regiment without further promotion. During Streight's Raid, the 73rd Indiana Infantry was captured. Walker was sent to Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia. He and other officers began working on a tunnel out of the prison on February 9, 1864. Walker succeeded in escaping the prison, but was recaptured by Confederates near Union lines. He was returned to prison and eventually exchanged in May 1864. After his exchange, Walker returned to the 73rd Indiana Infantry, which was then guarding the supply lines along the Tennessee River between Decatur and Stevenson, Alabama, in support of Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's Atlanta Campaign. Walker's long imprisonment in harsh conditions weakened his health, and he resigned his commission on July 4, 1864. He returned to Michigan City where he married Anna Layton on October 27, 1864. Still wishing to serve, Walker relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, where he served as a volunteer aide on the staff of Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas and performed valuable service during the siege and Battle of Nashville. Post- war service Walker and his wife remained in Nashville until 1870, when they moved to Indianapolis, Indiana. He served as a Marion County deputy county auditor and state tax commissioner for several years. He was an active member of the G.A.R. from its inception and served in every office from Post Commander up to Commander-in-Chief. Walker was serving as Post Commander of George H. Thomas Post No. 17 (Indianapolis) when he was appointed Assistant Adjutant General of the Department in 1887. In 1891 Walker was elected Department Commander and in 1893 he was elected Senior Vice-Commander-in- Chief. Walker was unanimously elected 24th Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic and served 1895-1896. While attending the 1905 national convention in Denver, Colorado, he became seriously ill. Walker died on November 25, 1905, and is buried at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis.

Under the pseudonym Gregory Seaworthy he wrote three novels, Nag's Head: or, Two Months among \\"The Bankers.\\" A Story of Sea- Shore Life and Manners; Bertie: or, Life in the Old Field. A Humorous Novel; and Lynde Weiss. The first of these was the first novel in the United States to deal with then-contemporary life in North Carolina. Life and career Throop was a native of Willsboro, New York; his father, George Throop, Sr., was a manufacturer and storekeeper, whose second wife, George, Jr.'s mother, died soon after giving birth to the boy. Initially named \\"Higby\\", he later took his father's first name as his own. He was a student of classics and an avid reader from youth. Throop attended the University of Vermont for one year, from 1835 to 1836, and may have attended another college afterwards. He married, unhappily, and soon the union broke up. Following this, he spent much of the 1840s as a schoolmaster and mariner. Throop is known to have come to the coastal plains of North Carolina by 1849, and he may have traveled there earlier. It is possible that he taught at a plantation near Hertford, but by March of that year he had moved to Scotch Hall, the plantation of Cullen Capehart located near Merry Hill in Bertie County. He remained there until October; during the summer he accompanied the family and servants to Nags Head, where the Capeharts had a summer residence. He then is supposed to have spent some time in Philadelphia overseeing the publication of his novels. Throop was not a success as a writer, and continued to work as a schoolmaster, traveling wherever he could find a position. He is known to have been in Georgia in 1853, but by the American Civil War he had settled in what would later become Hampshire County, West Virginia. There he was a well-liked member of the community, an accomplished singer, composer, and lyricist; however, suffering from alcoholism, he eventually ceased teaching. Around 1888 he discovered a previously unknown son from Boston, Massachusetts; the man, Edward H. Palmer, had taken his stepfather's name. Palmer gave his father twenty dollars a month, which allowed Throop to board with various inhabitants of Bloomery, the town in which he had last taught, until his death. He was buried in the cemetery of the Presbyterian church on Bloomery Run, his grave finally receiving a marker in 1955 through the efforts of the Pioneer Teachers Association of Hampshire County. Throop is memorialized by a state historic marker indicating the location of Scotch Hall and noting his authorship of Bertie. The marker is along U.S. Route 17 in Bertie County, about eight miles southeast of the house itself, which still stands and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Works Nag's Head Throop's first book, published under the pseudonym \\"Gregory Seaworthy\\" in 1850, was the novel Nag's Head; or, Two Months Among \\"The Bankers\\": A Story of Sea-Shore Life and Manners, based on his time with the Capeharts at their summer residence. It was published in Philadelphia by A. Hart, but bears a dedication signed from Merry Hill. Strictly speaking, the book is not a novel, but rather a memoir, in fictional form, of Throop's summer on the Outer Banks. The book has no plot, and no sustained characterization, but is valuable for capturing the spirit of a seaside vacation of the era and for offering glimpses of the region, its natives, and its lore. It was also the first novel concerned with contemporary North Carolina life. Gregory Seaworthy is presented as the narrator of the book; he is described as a Northerner, a former sailor, tutor to the children of a planter. He is said to be familiar with North Carolina literature, alluding to several other writers from the state, such as Calvin Henderson Wiley. Seaworthy records local history and folklore, and provides his impressions of the people and customs he sees. He also describes shipping traffic, ferries and schooners, along the coast and sound. The book is claimed to be a story of life among inhabitants of the Outer Banks, but very little is said about them; the narrator concerns himself chiefly with the planter population and their recreational activities, including swimming, fishing, and dancing. Nag's Head received scant literary attention, but it was noticed by Washington Irving, who sent Throop a letter expressing interest in the book. More recently, the book has been praised for its value as social history and for its humor. It was republished in 1958 with an introduction by Richard Walser. Bertie Irving's letter, coupled with a handful of other favorable notices, inspired Throop to try his hand at a second work of fiction. This was the novel Bertie: or, Life in the Old Field. A Humorous Novel, which was published in 1851, again in Philadelphia and again by A. Hart; Irving's letter was presented as a preface to the book in the first edition. The narrator of the novel is the same \\"Gregory Seaworthy\\" introduced in Nag's Head, but his history has been changed to make him the nephew of John Smallwood, an actual planter in the county. Other members of the Smallwood family are based on the Capeharts, with whom he had worked; the family home, \\"Cypress Shore\\", is almost certainly based on Scotch Hall. The plot of the novel concerns six couples and their various romantic adventures, but large swaths of the work are given over to descriptions of antebellum plantation society in the state and other bits of local color, such as holiday festivals and another summer trip to the sea. Cypress Shore is described in detail, as are neighboring estates, and much time is spent discussing their agricultural operations and products. Much of the romantic action of the book is centered on \\"Professor\\" Funnyford Matters, a \\"Practical Hydrologist\\" from the North who builds cisterns for drinking water on local plantations. Matters is a typical \\"Yankee\\" caricature, full of negative assumptions about the South and frequently claiming that the north is superior. He also weighs in on slavery, stating that Northern claims about its injustice are exaggerations and claiming further that southern masters are too tolerant; he also observes that the sternest of plantation overseers are actually Northerners. Bertie received a number of favorable notices; a reviewer for Godey's Lady's Book called it \\"one of the best American novels of the day\\". Even so, the work soon disappeared almost completely in the North. In North Carolina, it received almost no notice at all, even upon first publication. Lynde Weiss Throop's third and last novel, Lynde Weiss: An Autobiography, was brought out under his own name in Philadelphia by Lippincott, Grambo and Company in 1852. It contains no references to North Carolina. References External links *Electronic edition of Nag's Head: or, Two Months among \\"The Bankers.\\" A Story of Sea-Shore Life and Manners.

It was published on March 31, 2015 by Avon and debuted on the New York Times bestseller list at number 6. Background and publication Four Nights with the Duke is a sequel to James's 2014 novel, Three Weeks With Lady X. These two novels are technically part of James's Desperate Duchesses series. According to James, her novels take about a year to write. She penned Four Nights with the Duke while living in London. James based the heroine partly on her own younger self, \\"a plump, funny wallflower with a secret career writing romances\\". The novel was released by Avon on March 31, 2015. Readers who pre- ordered the novel were sent an additional ten pages of text that was cut from the novel. The extra chapter revolved around the protagonists of Three Weeks With Lady X. Plot summary The protagonists of the novel, Mia Carrington and Evander \\"Vander\\" Brody, were childhood acquaintances whose parents were involved in a long-term affair. The prologue details Mia's humiliation when, at age 15, another acquaintance ridicules her for writing a love poem to Vander. Thirteen years later, both are still single. Vander is now the Duke of Pindar, but eschews polite society to train racehorses at his estate. Mia is a very successful romance novelist, writing under a pen name. After her fiance leaves her at the altar, Mia is desperate. If she does not marry within the month, custody of her crippled nephew, Charlie, will revert to his evil uncle. Seeing few options for herself, Mia blackmails Vander into marriage. In a fit of anger, he announces he will grant her only four nights per year; Mia agrees to those terms. After the ceremony, Vander learns that Mia intends the marriage to be temporary. By now intrigued by her and quickly becoming attached to Charlie, Vander refuses to grant her an annulment.

Fuentebella , widely known as \\"Pepe\\" was one of the greatest Fuentebella politician in Philippine history for his tumultuous contributions to the country. He is the first Fuentebella to foray into the national arena of politics. Early life and education Jos√© studied at Colegio de San Buenaventura in Albay. He finished his Bachelor of Arts in Ateneo de Manila in 1902, obtained his Bachelor of Laws from Escuela de Leyes in 1905 and passed the bar in 1906. Jos√© practiced law for three years before entering politics at the age of 26. Political and Professional Career He was elected representative of Ambos Camarines for the Second Philippine Legislature in 1909. He also served to the Third Philippine Legislature until 1916. He convinced his father, Mariano Fuentebella, to run for governor of Ambos Camarines in 1912. Together they formed a powerful tandem and were able to obtain benefits for the province from the colonial government. When his father died, although he was in a higher office as a representative, Jos√© accepted the appointment as governor to finish his father's term and implement their joint projects. In 1916, he returned to private practice. But in 1931, he made his return to Senate in 1928 and served two terms (1928-1931 and 1931-1934). The Senate was abolished in 1935. In the legislative polls later that year, Jos√© won a seat in the unicameral National Assembly and served two terms until 1941. Although the Senate was restored in 1941, Jos√© ran for a seat in the Lower House in the November polls. However, the 1st Congress of the Commonwealth of the Philippines did not seat until 1945 as World War II came to the Philippines. During the Japanese Occupation, from September 1943 to December 1944, Jos√© was appointed Commissioner of the 5th Military District comprising the entire Bicol Region. After consulting guerilla leaders, he accepted the appointment from the Laurel government reluctantly and only to prevent more Japanese atrocities. After the war, he finished his term as representative and successfully defended himself from accusations that he had collaborated with the Japanese. Crowning his long and illustrious service to the nation, Jose was appointed Philippine Ambassador to Indonesia by then Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay. He exercised deft democracy from 1955 to 1961, a crucial time in Philippine and Indonesian relations. Subsequently, Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos appointed him Presidential Adviser on Foreign Affairs. Jose was an ardent nationalist and founder of the Nacionalista Party in Bicol. He is one who espoused the \\"Filipino First\\" policy of then Philippine President Carlos Garcia. One of his greatest achievements as a politician was the extension of the Philippine National Railways to Bicol, establishing Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges in Naga City, and being the author of the \\"Flag Law\\". Death He died on July 25, 1982.

Strongly influenced by German Expressionism and by the immigrant, and often Jewish, experience, the movement originated in Boston, Massachusetts, in the 1930s, continues in a third-wave form today, and flourished most markedly in the 1950s‚Äì70s. Most commonly associated with emotionality, and the bold color choices and expressive brushwork of painters central to the movement like Hyman Bloom, Jack Levine and Karl Zerbe, Boston Expressionism is also heavily associated with virtuoso technical skills and the revival of old master technique. The work of sculptor Harold Tovish, which spanned bronze, wood and synthetics is one example of the former, while the gold- and silverpoint found in some of Joyce Reopel's early work exemplifies the latter.  Origin  left Hyman Bloom and Jack Levine Hyman Bloom and Jack Levine, both key figures in the movement, shared similar roots. Both grew up in immigrant communities: Bloom in the slums of Boston's West End and Levine in the South End. In the 1930s, having attended settlement house art classes as children, both won fine arts scholarships and trained at the Fogg Museum with Denman Ross. Both also drew on their Eastern European Jewish heritage, and were strongly influenced by the \\"starkness and angst\\" of German Expressionism and by then contemporary Jewish painters, such as Chagall and Soutine. Bloom tended to explore spiritual themes, while Levine was more inclined toward social commentary and dark humor, but both came to prominence in 1942 when they were included in Americans 1942: 18 Artists from 9 States, a Museum of Modern Art exhibition curated by Dorothy Miller. Soon afterward, Time magazine called Bloom \\"one of the most striking of U.S. Colorists,\\" and Levine won a prize at an exhibit in the Metropolitan Museum in New York.Chaet (1980), p. 26. Together, they were referred to as \\"the bad boys of Boston.\\" Karl Zerbe \\"Street Scene #2\\" by Jack Levine, 1938Another influential artist at the time was Karl Zerbe, a painter from Germany who had studied in Italy and whose early work had been condemned by the Nazis as \\"degenerate\\". Zerbe emigrated to the United States in 1934, settling in Boston where he headed the Department of Painting at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. Zerbe helped reinvigorate the staid Boston art scene by bringing European ideas, particularly those of the German Expressionists, to Boston. He arranged for Max Beckmann and Oskar Kokoschka, among others, to lecture at the museum school. The Early \\"Boston Expressionists\\" By the early 1950s, Bloom, Levine, and Zerbe and the artists they influenced had been dubbed the Boston Expressionists. Confusingly, they were also sometimes referred to as the Boston School, a name typically used to reference another, older, Boston-based group. Each of these three artists had his own style, yet they shared certain tendencies. They did not paint directly from observation, but from memory and imagination; as Bernard Chaet put it, they favored \\"the conceptual over the perceptual\\". Like the Abstract Expressionists, they rejected the photographic naturalism preferred by the Nazis; and, Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock, who had seen Bloom's work in Americans 1942, considered Bloom \\"the first Abstract Expressionist artist in America.\\"Chaet (1980), p. 28. Yet Bloom never embraced pure abstraction and, to varying degrees, Bloom, Levine, and Zerbe also painted figuratively, which is why their school of painting, in particular, is sometimes referred to as \\"Boston figurative expressionism.\\" The three, like the movement as a whole, were known for their technical expertise. Like the Abstract Expressionists, they were painterly, treating the paint itself, and not just its color, as a meaningful element. Known for their experimentation with new media, they were also known for their interest in methodology through the ages, thus Zerbe, for example, helped revive the ancient Egyptian medium of encaustic, a mixture of pigment and hot wax, in the 1940s. Chaet called Bloom the link between Boston Expressionism and Abstract Expressionism. Bloom's Christmas Tree (1945) is an example of one of his more abstract works, barely suggesting the appearance of the original object by its shape.Bookbinder (2005), p. 132. Levine's Street Scene #2 (1938), with its hint of danger and corruption, is an example of Levine's characteristic themes and of the painterly brushwork and distorted yet skillfully rendered figures that were characteristic of Boston Expressionism. Later Generations Bloom, Levine, and Zerbe influenced a second generation of painters, many of them first- or second-generation Jewish immigrants, and many of them students of Zerbe's at the museum school. In a 1947 photo taken by John Brook at the Thirty Massachusetts Painters exhibition at the Institute of Modern Art, Zerbe is pictured with artists Carl Pickhardt, Reed Champion, Kahlil Gibran, John Northey, Esther Geller, Thomas Fransioli, Ture Bengtz, Giglio Dante, Maud Morgan, and Lawrence Kupferman. (In her memoir, Jean Gibran noted the photo's resemblance to the iconic Life magazine photo of \\"The Irascibles,\\" taken in 1950, and adds, \\"But the true 'irascibles' were the Boston artists.\\") Other artists in this group included David Aronson, Jason Berger, Bernard Chaet, Reed Kay, Jack Kramer, Arthur Polonsky, Henry Schwartz, Barbara Swan, Mel Zabarsky, Lois Tarlow, and Arnold Trachtman.Bookbinder (2005), p. 5. Mitchell Siporin, who directed the Department of Fine Arts at Brandeis University in the 1950s, is sometimes included in this category. To some extent, many of these young artists were outsiders at the museum school, with its links to the Boston Brahmin establishment and its emphasis on traditional techniques.Bookbinder (2005), p. 194. Looking back on his days there, Arthur Polonsky recalled an unspoken agreement among his classmates that there was something missing from the \\"academic\\" paintings of the Boston School, on the one hand, and the sterile \\"geometric purism\\" of some newer artists on the other. Bloom, Levine, and Zerbe helped many of them find an alternative path. Zerbe introduced them not only to German artists such as Grosz and Dix, but also to Mexican artists such as Rivera and Siqueiros. At the same time they continued to follow a rigorous program of traditional art education, studying the old masters of Europe as well as anatomy and perspective. There was a strong emphasis on drawing. As their skills developed, many students adopted a figurative approach with the understanding that an artist was not a reporter. \\"We tormented the subject matter,\\" Polonsky said. Many of their paintings were concerned with human suffering, rendered without the cool, ironic detachment that later seemed to become obligatory in treating such subjects. \\"The Last Supper\\" by David Aronson, 1944 One of the most successful artists to emerge from this group was David Aronson. In 1946 his \\"Trinity\\" and \\"The Last Supper\\" were included in Dorothy Miller's Fourteen Americans exhibition at MoMA, where they elicited both praise and indignation. One Boston critic denounced \\"The Last Supper\\" as \\"a footboard for the devil's bed\\". Aronson went on to direct the Fine Art Department at Boston University, and his work is widely exhibited and collected.Bookbinder (2005), pp. 193-195. Later artists influenced by Boston Expressionism include Aaron Fink, Gerry Bergstein, Jon Imber, Michael Mazur, Katherine Porter, Jane Smaldone, John Walker, and others. Philip Guston, who had ties to Boston, and whose return to representational art in the 1970s was a source of controversy, is often mentioned in connection with Boston Expressionism.Bookbinder (2005), p. 247.Capasso (2002), p. 10. Philosophy According to art historian Judith Bookbinder, \\"Boston figurative expressionism was both a humanist philosophy--that is, a human- centered and rationalist or classically oriented philosophy--and a formal approach to the handling of paint and space.\\" Pamela Edwards Allara of the Fine Arts Department at Tufts University calls Boston Expressionism a belief system created in context: \\"It is the evidence of a consistent set of assumptions about the function of art, which has been molded by the city's cultural climate.\\" Art critic Robert Taylor, writing in 1979, suggested that the \\"Boston attitudes\\" derived from Bloom's and Levine's religious background. Having received their early art instruction in a religious community center, he reasoned, it was not surprising that their work would evince a certain respect for tradition and discipline. Conversely, art historian Alfred Werner suggested in 1973 that Jewish immigrants fleeing oppression were freer to embrace modernism than other Americans because they were \\"less chained to a genteel tradition\\". Reception In the 1930s, Boston was notoriously conservative when it came to the arts. Even slight abstraction or imaginative use of color was unacceptable to most Boston critics and collectors, including the Museum of Fine Arts, and impressionists such as Edmund C. Tarbell and Frank Benson were still seen as cutting-edge. In this atmosphere, modern artists in Boston received little encouragement locally, and had to look to New York for support. A few notable exceptions were the Addison Gallery and the Busch-Reisinger Museum, and the art critic Dorothy Adlow, who supported the movement from its earliest days.Chaet (1980), p. 29. \\"The Museum of Fine Arts had a hands-off policy toward modern art.\\" In the forties, thanks in large part to Bloom and Levine and their New York successes, and to Zerbe's influence on his students, the art scene in Boston began to open up. National magazines such as Time, Life, and ARTnews took notice. The Boris Mirski Gallery opened on Newbury Street, and hosted exchange shows with Edith Halpert's Downtown Gallery in New York. In 1945, Adlow wrote, \\"Until a few years ago, Boston was artistically moribund...In the last dozen years, however, there has been an upsurge in Boston art life. A pronounced superiority in technical skill and a zestful creative buoyancy have attracted widespread interest.\\"Bookbinder (2005), p. 193. Despite these developments, many Boston collectors remained suspicious of modern art, and the Museum of Fine Arts remained unsupportive.Chaet (1980), pp. 26, 29. \\"True, works by Zerbe, Bloom, and Levine were accepted within a very small circle of collectors in Boston...but I knew first hand that the younger artists exhibiting in Boston in the forties who were influenced by many 'modern' sources were accused of distorting traditional norms.\\" Anti-Semitism may have been a factor, given that the Boston Expressionists were predominantly Jewish.Gibran (2014), Foreword by Charles Giuliano, p. 8. At the same time, the New York painters, influenced by the School of Paris, were moving in a different direction: not just distorting figures for expressive purposes, but eschewing figuration altogether. Neglected at home and out of step with New York, Boston Expressionism fell out of favor in the 1960s and received little attention from art historians in the succeeding decades.Taylor (1979). \\"The 40s and 50s...saw the first indigenous style to emerge here this century-- Boston Expressionism--a style generally dismissed by art historians of the '60s and '70s as backward-looking eclecticism.\\" More recently, Boston-area exhibitions and the publication of several books and articles have generated some renewed interest. In 2005, Judith Bookbinder published a book on the subject, Boston Modern: Figurative Expressionism as Alternative Modernism. Angelica Brisk's 2009 documentary on Bloom, The Beauty of All Things, was well received, and a film by Gabriel Polonsky about his father Arthur Polonsky, Release from Reason, is currently in production. Jean Gibran, wife of the artist , recalls the burgeoning Boston Expressionist art scene in her 2014 memoir, Love Made Visible: Scenes from a Mostly Happy Marriage. The Danforth Museum in Framingham, Massachusetts, maintains a large collection of Boston Expressionist art. Reviewing a 2011 exhibit at the Danforth, Boston Globe art critic Cate McQuaid wrote, \\"Boston Expressionism has always been luscious, bright, and deeply felt.\\" References Further reading * * External links * Boston Expressionism at the Danforth Museum, Framingham, MA * Boston Expressionism at the Childs Gallery, Boston MA * Boston Expressionism at the New England Journal of Aesthetic Research * Expressionism: Boston‚Äôs Claim to Fame, by Nicholas Capasso.

She made her first appearance in the pilot episode \\"Stepping Stone\\", which was broadcast on NBC on January 8, 2014. Burgess was a patrol officer of the Chicago Police Department's 21st District. She also appears in a recurring role in Chicago Fire. As of season 4, she is an officer with the Intelligence Unit. Casting On August 28, 2013, Nellie Andreeva from Deadline Hollywood reported that actress Marina Squerciati had been cast in the regular role of Kim Burgess in Chicago Fire spin-off series Chicago P.D.. Burgess was initially billed as \\"a feisty, sassy former flight attendant-turned-cop whose beauty belies a formidable inner strength.\\" Following the conclusion of the first season, Squerciati was prepared to go back to her paralegal job, until NBC renewed Chicago P.D. for a second season. Squerciati took maternity leave from the show in March 2017, and Kim made her temporary departure in the season four episode \\"Last Minute Resistance\\". Development Squerciati liked her character's \\"energy and happiness\\" and said, \\"I'm hoping that she maintains some of that joy. I think part of it is because she's green, but another part of it is because she's a driven, joyful person. She knows what she wants.\\" Squerciati liked that Burgess was not the perfect officer and made mistakes, as she found it very relatable. Burgess wanted to be promoted to the Intelligence Unit, but her partner Kevin Atwater (LaRoyce Hawkins) was promoted over her instead. Squerciati was \\"taken aback\\" by the development and explained \\"when I read it, I went to executive producer Derek Haas and writer Michael Brandt and said, 'Are you kidding me? I didn't make Intelligence?' I kind of mixed up that I wasn't really Kim Burgess.\\" The incident made Squerciati realise that she had become protective of her character and was upset for her. She also thought Burgess and Atwater's friendship would be tested by his promotion. Sgt. Hank Voight (Jason Beghe) later offered Burgess a promotion to Intelligence, but she turned it down. Squerciati commented that Burgess would question whether she had made a mistake and Squerciati hoped it was not a one-time offer. Storylines In her fictional backstory, Burgess was a flight attendant for three years before joining the CPD Academy. A native of St. Charles, she was born sometime in 1988. Burgess started the series as a patrol officer and a good candidate for Intelligence. She has a good partnership with former partner, Kevin Atwater. Both are constant targets of Desk Sergeant Trudy Platt's attitude. However, they are generally able to laugh it off after shift. Burgess has a good heart. When a woman is caught shoplifting bread to feed her son, Burgess pays for it and threatens the unyielding shopkeeper with fines for expired licenses. In a separate incident with a hoarder, Burgess discovers a kidnapped child hidden in the woman's basement. Kim and Officer Adam Ruzek have a close working friendship, frequently spending time bantering at work. Adam even helps her get revenge on Platt, who treats Burgess and Atwater horribly. After a particularly stressful call, Adam and Kim share a kiss. Kim regrets this almost instantly as Adam is engaged. However, after he breaks off his engagement, Kim and Adam begin a romantic relationship. In season 2, after Atwater was transferred to Intelligence, she is partnered with Officer Sean Roman. At the end of \\"Called In Dead\\", while Roman and his former partner were arguing outside, Burgess is shot in the shoulder by a shotgun shell connected to a trip wire, which was set as a trap, that was connected to the doorbell. Upon investigation, in \\"Shouldn't Have Been Alone\\", it was learned that the house itself was booby trapped, and it was intended for police officers, by a murderer, Spencer York. She spent two weeks on administrative duty while nursing back to health. On her first shift back, she served as the district's desk sergeant while Platt rode with Roman. After her shooting, Sgt. Voight offers her a promotion to Intelligence, but she declines in order to remain a patrol officer. In \\"What Do You Do\\", Burgess and Roman (while on a meal break) respond to a suspicious activity in a warehouse, which was to be a drug deal, without calling for backup. She manages to kill a suspect with a shard of glass from a window on the floor. They manage to get out of there when Ruzek called her and she never answered, causing Intelligence unit to go into the warehouse to catch the suspect about to drive away. Her partner was seriously wounded during the ordeal. Kim makes it back to the precinct, complimented by Platt, and garnering a slow clap from a crowd of cops for saving her partner's life and taking down the suspects. In \\"There's My Girl\\", Burgess is promoted to Intelligence after Atwater is demoted following a suspect's suicide while in custody. In \\"Born Into Bad News\\", she accepts Ruzek's offer of marriage when she discovers he has placed an engagement ring in her locker. At the end of \\"Looking Out for Stateville\\" Kim calls off the wedding to Ruzek, in the very same place he proposed. In doing so, Burgess then applies for a transfer to a new district in \\"Hit Me\\" which Platt is very shocked and upset to her, surprisingly. Both Burgess and Ruzek feel devastated but try to hide it. During \\"Hit Me\\", Kim is involved in a car crash, which results Ruzek rushing to her side. She feels uncomfortable and finds an excuse to leave. After Kim breaks up with Ruzek she starts to have feelings for her partner, Roman. This creates some tension between Roman and Ruzek. In \\"Justice\\" Burgess is investigated for shooting a hooded man who opened fire on their patrol car whilst Burgess and Roman were kissing, when the man has no gun in his hand. The gun is however later found in the water. Roman asks Burgess to go with him to San Diego; however, after realizing that this is what she wants to do, she decides to stay in Chicago. In season 4 \\"The Silos\\" Burgess meets her new partner, Julie Tay. In \\"A War Zone\\", Officer Tay is reassigned to her old job after her Commander Fogel goes over Platt's head in revenge of what Platt did against Fogel. Then, in \\"Some Friend\\", Sorensen becomes Burgess's partner before resigning in \\"A Shot Heard Around the World\\" due to the stress of a targeted shooting of two police officers. Burgess is offered a job in the Intelligence Unit, which she takes. In \\"Little Bit of Light\\", Burgess' sister Nicole is in town and immediately clashes with Ruzek, before revealing to a stunned Burgess that she is getting a divorce. In \\"Last Minute Resistance\\", when her sister was found in the subway and also a victim of a brutal sexual assault, and her friend missing (later found dead from hypothermia in an abandoned parking lot); she took the case very personally and stopped at nothing to solve the case. It was revealed to be two men who had put Ketamine in women's drinks and taking advantage of them. When one of the men tries to sexually assault Burgess; she stabs him on a shoulder with a lipstick that had a knife in it, and then beats him. She took some time off to take care of her sister and her niece. In \\"The Thing About Heroes\\", she mentored an officer named Frank Toma. When a terrorist attack happened at a street festival that claims many lives, he goes missing with many people convinced that he had something to do with it. While clearing his name, she disobeys orders to get evidence. When she was called to the lake by Frank Toma (knowing that there was nothing to be done) he commits suicide in front of her, leaving her distraught. It was soon discovered that a fellow officer and partner had contributed his problems even further prior to the investigation, when he found out that he was gay and Muslim. She vows to bring him down. Also in season-5, she starts a relationship with federal prosecutor Matt Miller. Things get rocky in \\"Politics\\", when he becomes a subject of the investigation into a Ukrainian girl's death in the Senator's hotel. She has to choose between Voight's loyalty and her boyfriend. In \\"Monster\\", she reveals to Ruzek that he was still not talking to her, leaving their relationship uncertain. In \\"Confidential\\", she gets her first confidential informant and when the informant reveals a possible murder which Burgess discounts but Upton pursues, revealing a corpse which ultimately leads to a prostitution ring. But when Burgess's informant ends up dead, Upton and Burgess butt heads on how to handle confidential informants. At the end of the episode, Burgess turns to her former lover Ruzek ending up getting a one-night stand. In \\"Sisterhood\\", she reveals that her sister's attackers only received three years, with them only serving one year for good behavior. In \\"Homecoming\\", upon hearing that her former partner, Olinsky had died from his injuries sustained from the stabbing, she was distraught about the events that played out. And she was tasked by Voight to clear off Olinsky's desk. She soon went excessive when she slaps the wife of a drug runner when she refuses to cooperate. In \\"Ride Along\\", she was requested by Deputy Superintendent Brennan to do a ride-along with the daughter, Kendra, of a VIP that wants to be a police officer. Things went sideways when she was involved in a shootout while on a call by Halstead to look for a car involved in a crime. Burgess leaves Kendra in the car while she goes to help a wounded victim; when she gets back, the girl is gone. Burgess later finds the girl at her mom's apartment. Voight sits Burgess down and urges her to tell the review board the truth in her hearing the next day. While looking for the shooter, she was summoned by Brennan into her office. In her office, Brennan tells Burgess not to follow Voight's advice; she is a ‚Äúfemale hero‚Äù and that is good PR, so she should lie and claim Kendra was not there. Conflicted, Burgess decides to take Brennan's side, and tells the review board that she was alone in her patrol car during the shooting. It gets complicated when Burgess takes testimony from a witness who claims Kendra saw the shooter, which would then destroy her lie to the review board. She runs directly to Brennan, who then acts like she never said anything about omitting Kendra, and is ‚Äúconfident‚Äù Burgess can find a way out of the situation. With evidence assuring that Kendra saw the shooter, she appeals to Kendra's ‚Äúmake a difference‚Äù desire, and gets her to come down to the district for a photo lineup. She identifies Trent as the shooter. After finding and saving Trent's life, Burgess decides that she is going to return to the review board and tell the truth. Later on, Voight snaps at her for not taking his advice, after, she punches her locker in frustration. Platt drops by and tells her to not switch sides. In \\"Ties that Bind\\", she, along with Upton, was kidnapped by gun buyers pretending to buy the cop killer bullets from them. They were eventually rescued by her team with Upton almost killing one of the captors. In \\"The Forgotten\\", she gets into an relationship with Superintendent Kelton's mayoral election aide, Blair Williams. Their relationship later ended in \\"What Could Have Been\\", when Blair was murdered meeting with his killer. The killer ended up being Ray Price's wife, Alicia Price, when she confessed to killing him to protect her daughter as Blair was attempting to blackmail into getting Ray to drop out of the race. Ray ended up taking the fall for her. In \\"No Regrets\\", after being mildly injured on the job, Burgess learns that she is pregnant. She decides to keep the baby and Ruzek stands beside her. While temporarily working as a 911 dispatcher in \\"I Was Here\\", Burgess takes a call about a possible domestic violence incident. She follows the location of the call and finds a person has been murdered. She is physically assaulted by a sexual predator while saving the victim who made the 911 call, and she has a miscarriage. Reception Kate Stanhope from TV Guide observed, \\"You gotta hand it to Officer Kim Burgess of Chicago P.D. She has a real knack for sniffing out trouble.

Liszt plied one of his favorite genres‚Äîthe programmatic one movement tone poem designed to provide both the variety and unity of a sonata or symphony. He drew his program from Gottfried August B√ºrger‚Äôs once widely read Gothic horror ballad Lenore. Punctuated with the grisly refrain \\"The dead ride quickly! Are you afraid,\\" the poem tells of Lenore‚Äôs wild hundred-mile midnight ride with the zombie of her recently slain soldier-fianc√©, toward a cemetery where their nuptials are solemnized amid a riotous gathering of skeletons and spectres. However, Claudio Arrau, who studied under Liszt's disciple Martin Krause, defended that the Ballade was actually based in the Greek myth of Hero and Leander, with the piece's chromatic ostinati representing the sea: \\"You really can perceive how the journey turns more and more difficult each time. In the fourth night he drowns. Next, the last pages are a transfiguration\\".Conversations with Arrau. Joseph Horowitz, 1982, p. 169 The ballad is based largely on two themes: a broad opening melody underpinned by menacing chromatic rumbles at the lower register of the keyboard, and a luminous ensuing chordal meditation. These themes are repeated a half-step lower; then march-like triplet-rhythms unleash a flood of virtuosity. Eventually, Liszt transforms the opening melody into a rocking major-key cantabile and reiterates this with ever-more grandiose exultation. The luminous chords provide a contemplative close.Ozawa Hall, Tanglewood, Program Booklet, August 11, 2004.

The Tovsta Mohyla burial mound, meaning fat barrow, is located in present day southern Ukraine near the city of Pokrov in Dnipro region.Kuzych and Bekhtir, \\"The golden pectoral from Tovsta Mohyla.\\". Golden Pectoral from Tovsta Mohyla History The ancient Scythians were a semi-nomadic Iranian people that lived around the northern area of the Black Sea with territory that stretched up into the Ural and Altai Mountain region. Their culture is thought to have lasted almost 1000 years, during which time they traded regularly with many Mediterranean and Asian cultures including the ancient Greeks, the ancient Persians and the ancient Chinese. The golden pectoral or breastplate is thought to have been ordered by a Scythian chieftain, made either by the native Scythian artisans, as some modern scholarly opinion maintains, or as usually thought, by ancient Greek metalworkers probably located in Panticapaeum which is in present day Crimea on the Black Sea. At any rate the style is certainly Greek, although the imagery reflects Scythian interests. The pectoral is made of solid 24 carat gold, with a diameter of 12 inches (30.6 cm) and weighs just over 2.5 pounds (1150 g) It is in the shape of a crescent and can be stylistically broken down into three sections.Pidvysotska ans Samina, \\"SCYTHIAN KING'S GOLD PECTORAL.\\". The top section, which is widely agreed to be the main focus of the piece, reflects Scythian daily life. The middle section is believed to represent Scythian connection to nature. Being that there are so many delicate details in this section the artisan(s) chose to solder all of the individual elements to a solid gold plate which serves as a backing for structural support.Reeder (ed.), \\"Scythian Gold: treasures from ancient Ukraine.\\". The third section is thought to represent Scythian belief in the cosmos and their mythology. It is believed that the pectoral was created by soldering together dozens of individually cast figures and elements.

Thamizhselvi first thought that Rasayya was also a womaniser, so Rasayya proved her the contrary. One day, Undrayar Gounder tried to rape Thamizhselvi but she killed him. Rasayya surrendered for the murder and he was sentenced to the capital punishment. The reporter promises to save Rasayya from the capital punishment. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.

The golf course near Kananaskis Village, Alberta designed by the golf course architect Robert Trent Jones, consists of two 18-hole golf layouts, played beneath Mt. Lorette and Mt. Kidd, after which the courses are respectively named. Score Golf Magazine has consistently ranked this facility as a top 100 course in Canada. Kananaskis Country Golf Course is part of the collection of seven golf courses and resorts in Alberta, the Canadian Rockies Golf ‚Äì \\"the most storied and recognized group of golf courses in Canada.\\" About sixty thousand rounds of golf were played there annually with eighty-five percent played by Albertans. The golf course includes the pro-shop, club house, tournament centre and other golf course buildings which were valued at $15 million in 2015. During the June 2013 Alberta floods, Kananaskis Country \\"sustained the most extensive damage in its 36-year history.\\" The Alberta government committed $18 million to rebuild the Course and to protect it from future flood damage. History The course was built while Premier Peter Lougheed was in office at a cost of $25.5 million ($ million in ) using energy resource money from the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund to diversify Alberta's economy. Since its opening in 1983 Kan-Alta Golf Management Ltd has had the lease to operate the Kananaskis Country Golf Course. Kan-Alta Golf is now the construction manager for the restoration of the golf course following the 2013 flood. Architect Jones, the architect described the course's location in the Rockies as \\"the best natural setting I‚Äôve ever been given to work with.\\" Early in his career Jones had formed a partnership with Canadian architect Stanley Thompson, and he helped design several courses in Canada, including Capilano in Vancouver and Banff in the Canadian Rockies. Between 1931 and 1999, Jones designed or re-designed about 500 golf courses in at least 40 U.S. states and 35 other countries. Courses The cascading Kananaskis River runs through the golf courses. The Mt. Kidd layout is known for its island-like 4th green. Canadian golf expert Greg Dickman said, \\"[p]laying from 7,102 yards from the gold tees, Mt. Lorette is a tough enjoyable test of golf with water potentially coming into play on seven of the opening nine holes.\\" Ratings SCOREGolf‚Äôs Golfers‚Äô Choice Awards has recognized Kananaskis Country Golf Course as \\"Best of the Best\\" in the following categories: Best Value in the West, Best Service in the West, Best Condition in the West, Best par 4 in the West, Best Par 5 in the West and Best Golf Destination in the West. Golf Digest rated the Mount Kidd and Mount Lorette in the top 50 Courses in North America for \\"Great Value.\\" Score Golf Magazine rated this facility at 7.6400, making it among the top courses in Alberta. In 2011 ScoreGolf listed Mt. Kidd as the third Best Public Course in Alberta, with Mt. Lorette taking fifth place and Golf Week included Mt.Kidd on its list of Best Canadian Golf Modern Courses. In November 2011, the golf publication, Golf Digest included Kananaskis Country Golf Course on its top 75 golf resorts biennial list. Economic Impact In 2011 the Kananaskis Country Golf Course showed a province wide net economic impact of $14 million, 175 full-time equivalent jobs sustained province wide, and a $4.4 million federal, $1.9 million provincial and $800,000 local taxes generated. 2013 Alberta floods The Kananaskis I.D. in which the Kananaskis Country Golf Course is located was severely flooded in the June 2013 Alberta floods, the costliest insured natural disaster in Canadian history. Of the thirty six holes, all but four were flood damaged. Buildings on higher ground, valued at $15 million, were not damaged. On 16 July 2014, Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development (AESRD) finalized and signed an agreement with Kan-Alta Golf Management Ltd., a company with alleged connections the provincial government to rebuild the golf course. Calgary Herald journalist McClure reported a \\"secret deal\\" involving AESRD, \\"resulted in over $5.4 million\\" paid to Kan-Alta Golf \\"to cover business losses and other expenses\\" at the Kananaskis Country Golf Course, as a result of the 2013 flood damage. Also, \\"another $145,000 in property taxes owed by Kan-Alta Golf Management Ltd. were forgiven by government appointees on the local improvement district and reimbursement sought from the province.\\" This was confirmed by Alberta Municipal Affairs. McClure added that \\"another $8 million in compensation and some portion of the $15-million estimate for rebuilding the 36-hole facility may yet be paid to Kan-Alta.\\" According to an independent report by Deloitte LLP in September 2015, Alberta taxpayers would have to pay up to $16.9 million to break the contract with Kan-Alta. The contract between the PC government of Alberta and the company \\"dates back to the course‚Äôs opening in 1983 when documents show the firm ‚Äî owned by friends and former associates of former Premier Don Getty who have donated $2,600 to the Tories in recent years ‚Äî was awarded the contract to operate the facility even though government documents show they were not the lowest bidder.\\" The contract will be put out to public tender until 2026. \\"No one in our government wants to be in the golf course business ‚Ä¶ and in 2026 this will be put out to public tender.

It was then screened on ITV Encore in the UK from 19 October onwards and on Shudder in the US from 18 January 2019 onwards. Plot In the first season of Jordskott, police detective Eva Th√∂rnblad (Moa Gammel), returns to her hometown of Silverh√∂jd, seven years after her daughter Josefine disappeared beside a lake in the forest. Josefine's body was never found and local police determined that she had drowned. Upon Eva's return, a local boy is missing and she begins to look for similarities between this disappearance and that of her daughter. At the same time, she has to deal with the death and probate of her late father and his large timber felling and processing business, Th√∂rnblad Mineral & Cellulosa. Eva teams up with G√∂ran Wass (G√∂ran Ragnerstam), a Rikskriminalen detective (and a member of a secret society), and Tom Aronsson (Richard Forsgren), a local detective. They discover that the children's disappearance is inextricably tangled with the conflict between local and mystical elements wishing to protect the forest and the community at large, which depend on Th√∂rnblad Mineral & Cellulosa. In season two, Eva Th√∂rnblad is back in Stockholm, working with G√∂ran and Tom, to find missing teenagers and to solve the mystery of a man who dies as he turns to stone.

It is registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List. Location The building stands on the eastern side of Gdanska Street, in the area delimitated by: * Dwernicki street; * ≈ªo≈Çnierska street; * Czerkaska street; * Gda≈Ñska Street. This whole area lies within the Forest district in Bydgoszcz. History The building was built between 1913 and 1914 and designed by German architects Arnold Hartman and Robert Schlezinger. The 1913 initial footprint of the project covered an area of approximately 22 hectares within the administrative boundaries of the city. The estate was planned to be the seat of the German War College (), but the start of World War I changed it all, and the edifice housed during the conflict a German military hospital. In 1920 the building was taken over by the Polish authorities of the city. After lengthy negotiations and efforts of General Kazimierz Sosnkowski, then Deputy Minister of Military Affairs, the city agreed to hand over the edifice to the Polish Ministry of Military Affairs. On July 11, 1920, the building housed the High School of Infantry which had moved from Pozna≈Ñ due to the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. On August 1, 1922, the school was converted into an Officer Academy for Non- Commissioned Officers (NCOs) and on August 9, 1928, it has been renamed the NCO Cadet School. In the first half 1939, the building housed the Naval Cadet School. From July 1, 1943 to January 17, 1945 the building, seized by Nazi armed forces, has accommodated the Intelligence and Cavalry School (). After the liberation of Bydgoszcz in January 1945, Soviet troops were billeted here. From 1947 to 2007, the edifice housed the Pomeranian Military District Command, and since 2007 it is the seat of the Inspectorate of Armed Forces Support. In an adjacent building is open a military museum. Army Museum of Bydgoszcz] Architecture The massive building has a E-shaped foot print, following eclecticism style with a clear predominance of neo-Baroque elements. The building has a prominent avant-corps on its center and wings: all is topped with high Mansard roofs with dormers. The front portico, with Tuscan styled columns is prominent and topped by a balcony crowned with an elliptical pediment. The facade is divided by a series of decorative cornices and wide pilasters. Among the noteworthy elements of architectural decoration and stucco are: * stone balusters and helmets; * flaming vases; * pelmets and Bydgoszcz's coats of arms. The interiors still preserve the original layout: adorned staircases, arcade hall, tiled corridors and walls with panelling and pilasters, and stucco ceilings. Next to the War College is the former Directorate building (). It is an impressive villa with a portico, terraces, balconies and stylised pediments. The whole area is surrounded by a cast iron fence, decorated with stone trophies. The building and its architectural environment has been put on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List N¬∞601325 Reg.A/30/1-6, on December 28, 2000.zabytek-kujawsko- pomorskie-28.02.2014 Gallery File:Kasern Bromberg map 1914.jpgDetail of 1914 map with military area File:War college 1916.jpgWar college in Bromberg, 1916 File:War college 1938.jpgWar College Bydgoszcz, 1938 File:Bydgoszcz, szko≈Ça wojenna, ob. sztab, 1913-1914 9.JPG View with the cast iron fence File:Gda≈Ñska 190 POW rze≈∫ba.jpgStone figure File:Bydgoszcz, willa komendanta, 1913-1914 sd.JPG Willa Komendanta File:War college.JPGCommander's house See also * Bydgoszcz * Gdanska Street in Bydgoszcz * Downtown district in Bydgoszcz References External links * Poslish Armed Forces Logistics Inspectorate * Army Museum of Bydgoszcz Bibliography * Wielkopolska Szko≈Ça PodchorƒÖ≈ºych Piechoty.

The Altsiedelland was the result of early historic land acquisition in Central Europe in about the 5th to 8th centuries. The preferred settlement areas were those that were easy to develop for agriculture: the b√∂rde, loess and basin regions in what is now central and southern Germany, the G√§u landscapes in the southwest and the dry geest ridges in the northwest, that were also referred to as Gunstr√§ume or \\"favourable areas\\". Initially they were settled by individual or double farmsteads, or small hamlets (such as the so-called Drubbel). From the Carolingian period onwards, the growing population also began to develop less favourable terrain by extending the farmland of existing settlements or clearing the forest in previously uninhabited areas and laying out new villages. These new areas are, logically, referred to as the Jungsiedelland (\\"new settlement land\\").

It was suppressed in 1792 during the French Revolution, looted, stripped of its decor, and used to store theater sets. In 1811, it was given by Napoleon to the Protestant congregation of Saint-Louis-du-Louvre when that building was demolished to make way for the expansion of the Louvre.

Celebrated by the local people of the state with sufficient vigor, the festival of Dussehra connotes to the supreme power of goddess Danteswari. During Dussera, the inhabitants of Bastar organizes special worship ceremonies at the Danteswari temple of Jagadalpur.  History  It is believed that Maharaja Purushaottam Deo first initiated the festival of Dussehra in the early hours of 15th century. Bastar to take part in this holy festival. During the entire ten days of the occasion, the respected Raj family of Bastar arrange worship sessions in which the ancient arms of the Goddess Danteswari are treated as divine elements. One of the inherent traits of Bastar Dussehra is that the control of the state is formally transferred to the Diwan keeping the Zamindar and similar important personalities as witnesses. Kunwar amavasya is the first day of dussera. On the night of the first day the customary transfer of control takes place. A mystique characteristics of this ceremony is that before handing over the power to the Diwan, a girl who is believed to have possessed the spiritual powers is asked for permission. This girl is seen with a wooden sword and stands in a war-like posture. The second day of dussehra is called pratipada which is followed by aarti and salami. On the ninth day, the Raja of Bastar welcomes goddess Danteswari who comes to the entrance of the city in a doli or palanquin. The tenth day of the festival is called dussehra when the Raja organizes a darbar where people come and present their requests. Also aarti ceremony is held on the last day of dussehra . . The dussehra festival is a famous event of India. But the dussehra of Bastar is completely different from the commonly known festival of the country. Bastar Dussehra celebrate the divine bliss of Goddess Danteswari who is the revered deity of all the existing tribes of Chhattisgarh.

The Swiss military was in need of a cavalry carbine for their mounted units, so they tried shortening the existing Schmidt‚ÄìRubin 1889, but its action proved to be too long to be effective to maneuver with while mounted, so the Swiss government began trials for a new carbine.

The Mannlicher straight-pull design was chosen for its compactness. It was carried by side sling swivels and didn't feature a bayonet mount. These carbines were supposedly hated by the Swiss soldiers as they were hard to field strip and their bolts were hard to disassemble.

Earthquake rotational loading indicates the excitation of structures due to the torsional and rocking components of seismic actions. Nathan M. Newmark was the first researcher who showed that this type of loading may result in unexpected failure of structures, and its influence should be considered in design codes.N. M. Newmark, Torsion in symmetrical building, Proc. 4th world conf. earthquake eng. Santiago, Chile 2, A.3 (1969) 19-32. There are various phenomena that may lead to the earthquake rotational loading of structures, such as propagation of body wave, surface wave, special rotational wave, block rotation, topographic effect, and soil structure interaction.M. R. Falamarz-Sheikhabadi, M. Ghafory-Ashtiany, Approximate formulas for rotational effects in earthquake engineering, Journal of Seismology, Vol.16 (2012) 815-827. One of challenges in structural engineering is defining reliable and accurate loading patterns for design of earthquake- resistant structures based on all components of seismic motions, i.e., three translational and three rotational components. From earthquake engineering perspective, it is usually assumed that the rotational components of strong ground motions are induced due to the spatial variation of the seismic waves and, consequently, these components are estimated in terms of corresponding translational components.M. R. Falamarz-Sheikhabadi, Simplified relations for the application of rotational components to seismic design codes, Engineering Structures, Vol.59 (2014) 141-152. When the earthquake shaking can be specified at a single point, the rotational loading of structures can be performed by point rotation, which corresponds with gradient of a point on the ground surface. Most investigations on the earthquake rotational loading, by considering the effect of point rotation on the behavior of structures have shown that the rotational components based on their frequency content can severely change dynamic behavior of structures, which are sensitive to high- frequency motions, such as secondary systems, historical monuments, nuclear reactors, tall asymmetric buildings or irregular frames, slender tower shape structures, bridges, vertically irregular structures, and even ordinary multi- story buildings.M. D. Trifunac, The role of strong motion rotations in the response of structures near earthquake faults, Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering, Vol.29 (2009) 382-393. The contribution of the rotational components to the seismic response of structures supported on the rigid mat foundation can even be amplified if the effects of the kinematic and dynamic soil structure interaction are considered in structural loading and modeling.J. E. Luco, H. L. Wong, Response of a rigid foundation to a spatially random ground motion, Earthquake Engineering and Structural Dynamics, Vol.14 (1986) 891‚Äì908. In a recent study, the combined action of the rotational loading and multi-support excitation on the seismic behavior of short-span bridges was investigated. The numerical results suggested that depending on structure properties and excitation characteristics, rotational components decrease beneficial effects of multi-support excitation on the structure response. M. R. Falamarz-Sheikhabadi, A. Zerva, M. Ghafory-Ashtiany, Mean absolute input energy for in-plane vibrations of multiple-support structures subjected to horizontal and rocking components, Journal of Probabilistic Engineering Mechanics, 45 (2016) 87-101. In spite of the fact that the rotational components may significantly affect the seismic behavior of structures, their influence is not currently considered in most modern design codes,Z. Zembaty., Rotational seismic load definition in Eurocode 8, part 6, for slender tower-shaped structures, Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, Vol. 99 (2009) 1483-1485. which the main reasons of this ignorance may be attributed to: (1) lack of the recorded data on the rotational accelerations and difficulty in presenting a quantitative assessment of the rotational acceleration components for given translational components, and (2) complexity in derivation of simplified seismic loading patterns for structures subjected to rotational excitations.M. R. Falamarz-Sheikhabadi, M. Ghafory- Ashtiany, Rotational components in structural loading, Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering, Vol. 75 (2015) 220-233. To better understand the effects of the rotational components on the seismic behavior of structures, recently, new seismic intensity parameters were proposed to evaluate the contribution of the rotational components to the structural response.M. R. Falamarz-Sheikhabadi, A. Zerva, M. Ghafory-Ashtiany, Revised seismic intensity parameters for middle-field horizontal and rocking strong ground motions, Journal of Structural Engineering (2016), DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0001646.

In the Republic of Khakassia, 29 people were killed and 6,000 left homeless. Further east in Zabaykalsky Krai, four people died in wildfires near Chita. Damage was also reported in Inner Mongolia. Wildfires The series of wildfires began on Sunday morning, 12 April in Khakassia as intentional fires set to clear grass for agriculture were caught by strong winds and got out of control. Warm, dry weather help spread the fires, which quickly spread into the region's forests; daytime temperatures had reached 25 ¬∞C and spreading waves of flames soared to 3 meters in height. Russian television said the fires could be seen from space on satellite imagery. At 1 p.m. local time (6:00 GMT), a state of emergency was declared. Fire control planes and helicopters were dispatched by the Ministry of Emergency Situations, but the fires were not completely extinguished until around 6:00 a.m. on 13 April. Separately, 86 wildfires were reported in Zabaykalsky Krai from 13‚Äì14 April. Fires approached the city of Chita, threatening to ignite an arms dump. Visibility was reduced to 200‚Äì300 m. Eyewitnesses described the scene as \\"an apocalypse\\" as Chita was filled with smoke for days. An estimated 1,850 military personnel and volunteers worked to extinguish the fires. According to The Kremlin, Vladimir Putin personally took charge of coordinating disaster response. The fires were reported out on 15 April; however, the report was incorrect and fires remained ongoing on 16 April. Chinese media reports said the fires also spread into Inner Mongolia. Impact The wildfires killed at least 29 people in Khakassia, with three people unaccounted for as of 16 April. Approximately 900 others were injured. Seventy-seven people were hospitalized, with eight in critical condition as of 14 April. Approximately 1,300 homes across 34 villages were damaged, leaving roughly 6,000 people homeless. The town of Shira (near Lake Shira) was hardest hit, with 420 homes burned to the ground. As of 16 April, approximately 800 people across Khakassia remained in hospitals or emergency shelters. Livestock losses were estimated at 5,000 cattle and sheep, with the possibility of more deaths from starvation due to lack of grass to eat. More than 10,000 km2 of land was burnt in the fires. The Khakassia government designated 14 April as an official day of mourning. In the aftermath of the fires, looters were seen stealing bicycles, pipes, and other metal objects to sell as scrap metal. In Zabaykalsky Krai, four deaths were reported. About 20 people were injured, with one person hospitalized. Over 150 homes across 19 villages were damaged, leaving more than 800 people homeless. An estimated 107,000 hectares of land was burnt. In Inner Mongolia, 85 buildings were damaged as well as farming equipment and other vehicles. The damage there was estimated at US$3.2 million. The Federal Forestry Agency blamed local officials for failing to follow agency guidelines for preventing wildfires. Alexei Yaroshenko, a Greenpeace forest expert, demanded that Emergency Situations Minister Vladimir Puchkov and regional Governor Viktor Zimin be punished for the incident. Deputy Emergency Minister Alexander Chupriyan blamed carelessness by citizens saying, \\"This fire would not have happened if no one played with matches.\\" At least five criminal cases related to the fires have been filed. Authorities did not rule out that some of the fires may have been set by arsonists.

The festival reflects the rich culture and tradition of the state. The Madai Festival is celebrated with great enthusiasm and excitement by people belonging to the Gond Tribe. It is celebrated from the month of December to March and tours from one place of the state to another. The Charama and Kurna communities of Kanker district, tribes of Bastar and people of Bhanupratappur, Narayanpur, Kondagaon, Pakhanjore and Antagrah celebrate the Madai Festival in the state of Chhattisgarh. The local tribes of the state along with other communities worship the presiding deity during the festival. In the beginning of Madai Festival, the tribal people of Chhattisgarh launch a procession on an open field where a large number of devotees and general tourists gather to witness the rituals. After the end of the procession, the priest or similar figure starts worshiping the goddess. While the Puja ceremony goes on, the onlookers maintain silence and also offer prayers to the feet of the deity. When the worshiping finishes, several cultural events like folk dance, drama, songs etc. start taking place in the open space. As a huge number of villagers come to enjoy the occasion, the Madai Festival is always organized on a vast stretch of land. The Bastar region of Chhattisgarh marks the beginning of the Madai Festival. From Bastar the festival goes to the Kanker district of the state from where it moves to Narayanpur, Antagarh and Bhanupratappur. Keshkal, Bhopalpattnam and Kondagaon welcome Madai Festival in the month of March when it comes to its final end. Since the Madai Festival goes from one location to another, each and every tribe and other human groups of Chhattisgarh enjoy the unique pleasures of the occasion.

Written by Dr Joseph Yeo Boon Woi of Singapore's National Institute of Education, the objective is to determine the birthday of a girl named Cheryl using a handful of clues given to her friends Albert and Bernard. The question was posed as part of the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad (SASMO) in 2015, and was first posted online by Singapore television presenter Kenneth Kong. It went viral in a matter of days. Origin The question was first posted on Facebook by Singapore television presenter Kenneth Kong on April 10, 2015, and quickly went viral. Kong posted the puzzle following a debate with his wife, and he incorrectly thought it to be part of a mathematics question for a primary school examination, aimed at 10- to 11-year-old students, although it was actually part of the 2015 Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad meant for 14-year-old students, a fact later acknowledged by Kong. The competition was held on 8 April 2015, with 28,000 participants from Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, China and the UK. According to SASMO's organisers, the quiz was aimed at the top 40 per cent of the contestants and aimed to \\"sift out the better students\\". SASMO's executive director told the BBC that \\"there was a place for some kind of logical and analytical thinking in the workplace and in our daily lives\\".BBC News, 14 April 2015 The question The question is number 24 in a list of 25 questions, and reads as follows: > Albert and Bernard just become friends with Cheryl, and they want to know > when her birthday is. Cheryl gives them a list of 10 possible dates: { >  - ! May   15  16    19 - ! June     17  18  > - ! July  14   16    - ! August  14  15   17   } Cheryl then > tells Albert and Bernard separately the month and the day of her birthday > respectively. Albert: I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know > that Bernard doesn't know too. > Bernard: At first I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know now. > Albert: Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is. > So when is Cheryl's birthday? Solution The answer to the question is July 16. The answer can be deduced by progressively eliminating impossible dates. This is how Alex Bellos in the UK newspaper The Guardian presented its outcome: > Albert: I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know that Bernard > doesn't know too. All Albert knows is the month, and every month has more > than one possible date, so of course he doesn't know when her birthday is. > The first part of the sentence is redundant. The only way that Bernard could > know the date with a single number, however, would be if Cheryl had told him > 18 or 19, since of the ten date options these are the only numbers that > appear just once, as May 19 and June 18. For Albert to know that Bernard > does not know, Albert must therefore have been told July or August, since > this rules out Bernard being told 18 or 19. Line 2) Bernard: At first I > don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but now I know. Bernard has deduced > that Albert has either August or July. If he knows the full date, he must > have been told 15, 16 or 17, since if he had been told 14 he would be none > the wiser about whether the month was August or July. Each of 15, 16 and 17 > only refers to one specific month, but 14 could be either month. Line 3) > Albert: Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is. Albert has therefore > deduced that the possible dates are July 16, Aug 15 and Aug 17. For him to > now know, he must have been told July. If he had been told August, he would > not know which date for certain is the birthday. Therefore, the answer is > July 16. Incorrect solution After the question went viral, some people suggested August 17 as an alternative answer to the question. This was rejected by the Singapore and Asian School Math Olympiads as an invalid answer. The solutions that arrive at this answer ignore that the latter part of: > Albert: I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know that Bernard > doesn't know too. conveys information to Bernard about how Albert was able to deduce this. Bernard would only have known the birthday if the date was unique, 18 or 19. Albert therefore is able to deduce that \\"Bernard doesn't know\\" because he heard a month that does not contain those dates (July or August). Realizing this, Bernard can rule out May and June, which allows him to arrive at a unique birthday even if he is given the dates 15 or 16, not just 17. The SASMO organizers pointed outHenry Ong, Executive Director, Singapore and Asian School Math Olympiads, SASMO's Reply to Queries Why Cheryl's birthday is not Aug 17 that August 17 would be the solution if the sequence of statements instead began with Bernard saying that he did not know Cheryl's birthday: > Bernard: I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is. > Albert: I still don't know when Cheryl's birthday is. > Bernard: At first I didn't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know now. > Albert: Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is. It would also be the answer if the first statement were instead made by Cheryl: > Cheryl: Bernard doesn't know when my birthday is. > Albert: I still don't know when Cheryl's birthday is. > Bernard: At first I didn't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know now. > Albert: Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is. Note: The final statements by Albert in the two alternative examples only completes a dialogue; they are not needed by the reader to determine Cheryl's birthday as August 17. Sequel On May 14, 2015, Nanyang Technological University uploaded a second part to the question on Facebook, entitled \\"Cheryl's Age\\". It reads as follows: > Albert and Bernard now want to know how old Cheryl is. > Cheryl: I have two younger brothers. The product of all our ages (i.e. my > age and the ages of my two brothers) is 144, assuming that we use whole > numbers for our ages. > Albert: We still don't know your age. What other hints can you give us? > Cheryl: The sum of all our ages is the bus number of this bus that we are > on. > Bernard: Of course we know the bus number, but we still don't know your > age. > Cheryl: Oh, I forgot to tell you that my brothers have the same age. > Albert and Bernard: Oh, now we know your age. So what is Cheryl's age? Solution to sequel Cheryl first says that she is the oldest of three siblings, and that their ages multiplied makes 144. 144 can be decomposed into prime number factors by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic (), and all possible ages for Cheryl and her two brothers examined (for example, 16, 9, 1, or 8, 6, 3, and so on). The sums of the ages can then be computed. Because Bernard (who knows the bus number) cannot determine Cheryl's age despite having been told this sum, it must be a sum that is not unique among the possible solutions. On examining all the possible ages, it turns out there are two pairs of sets of possible ages that produce the same sum as each other: 9, 4, 4 and 8, 6, 3, which sum to 17, and 12, 4, 3 and 9, 8, 2, which sum to 19. Cheryl then says that her brothers are the same age, which eliminates the last three possibilities and leaves only 9, 4, 4, so we can deduce that Cheryl is 9 years old and her brothers are 4 years old, and the bus the three of them are on has the number 17. Second sequel: \\"Denise's Revenge\\" On May 25, 2015, mathematics writer Alex Bellos published a follow-up to the puzzle, entitled \\"Denise's Revenge\\", in his column \\"Alex Bellos's Monday Puzzle\\" in The Guardian. This sequel was also written by Dr Yeo, the original author of \\"Cheryl's Birthday\\". The puzzle features a new character, Denise, whose birth date the three original characters aim to determine. The puzzle states: > Albert, Bernard and Cheryl became friends with Denise, and they wanted to > know when her birthday is. Denise gave them a list of 20 possible dates. 17 > Feb 2001, 16 Mar 2002, 13 Jan 2003, 19 Jan 2004 > 13 Mar 2001, 15 Apr 2002, 16 Feb 2003, 18 Feb 2004 > 13 Apr 2001, 14 May 2002, 14 Mar 2003, 19 May 2004 > 15 May 2001, 12 Jun 2002, 11 Apr 2003, 14 Jul 2004 > 17 Jun 2001, 16 Aug 2002, 16 Jul 2003, 18 Aug 2004 > Denise then told Albert, Bernard and Cheryl separately the month, the day > and the year of her birthday respectively. The following conversation > ensues: Albert: I don't know when Denise's birthday is, but I know that > Bernard does not know. > Bernard: I still don't know when Denise's birthday is, but I know that > Cheryl still does not know. > Cheryl: I still don't know when Denise's birthday is, but I know that > Albert still does not know. > Albert: Now I know when Denise's birthday is. > Bernard: Now I know too. > Cheryl: Me too. > So, when is Denise's birthday? The next day, Bellos published the solution to \\"Denise's Revenge\\", which is solved in the same way as \\"Cheryl's Birthday\\", by successive eliminations. The correct solution is 14 May 2002.

A general description of the principle is that one explosive compound with one set of properties is detonated, and the detonation wave from this is transfers into another explosive compound with different set of properties. The principle is most often used for detonating insensitive explosive compounds by using stages of less and less sensitive explosive compounds. A simple example is the common industrial detonator, where a very small amount of a sensitive explosive detonates, causing the less sensitive main charge of the detonator to detonate. It may involve additional steps where successively less sensitive compounds trigger a detonation wave in each other, with stages including various types of booster charges. Staged detonation may be used to initiate cheap and insensitive mining explosives, but the principle has other uses. In certain applications there is a need to modify the shape of a detonation wave travelling through an explosive material. One example of this can be found in explosive lenses. Here the properties of different explosive compounds are used to initiate each stage in the detonation with a specific relative delay, creating a detonation wave with a non conventional shape. That shape can for example be a spherical wave travelling in towards the centre of that sphere, or any other shape required. This principle is used in many areas in high energy research, as well as in nuclear weapons. It does not necessarily involve different explosive compounds. Because the properties of an explosive compound is in some degree related to its density, which is a result of with what pressure it is compressed during manufacture, the stages in a staged detonation may also come from each section having been pressed to a different density, giving it varying properties. The term Staged detonation may also refer to a method where several explosive charges are set to detonate in series with a given delay between them. This method called Delayed detonation. This method is commonly used in industrial demolition activities such as mining. History and Development of the Principle The use of a primary and secondary explosive was the first practical use of the staged detonation principle, and was revolutionary to the safety of the mining industry. After this staged detonation is used in everything from explosive lenses in nuclear weapons (where the different properties of each explosive create a perfectly spherical detonation wave moving in towards origo) to mining where each blasting operation requires several stages to detonate each main charge, not only the primary and secondary explosive used in the simplest staged detonation.

The construction is very similar to the construction of any other multi-tool or pliers. The specific feature is the presence of one groove on each of the opposing jaws. When the jaws are open, the groves will appear as a semi circle with an elliptical extension. When fully closed the two grooves will form a cylindrical shape. When a detonator is delivered, it is sometimes delivered as a piece of metal with nothing connected to it. To function, the detonator must be mated with the correct initiation source. The correct initiation source could for example be tar-fuse for time delay, or a Shock tube detonator to name a few. The rear part of a detonator is usually made of a rigid but malleable aluminium alloy, sometimes supported by a relatively soft brass or copper structure to aid in reliably giving a strong and watertight seal without damaging the initiation source. A pair of detonator crimping pliers mate the detonator with the initiation source by allowing the detonator's back end to be inserted into the large hole present when the pliers is in the non-compressed position. When force is applied, the jaws will move closer to each other crimping the neck of the detonator. This shows that the function is just a simple crimping tool, adapted for one specific item. Risks Each type of detonators have an instruction/information folder written by the manufacturer or the distributor. In it are clear instructions on how to crimp that specific type/model. Most detonators contain relatively sensitive explosive compound meant to initiate the staged detonation train. Crimping a detonator in the wrong place or with improper tools may cause it to detonate.

The current district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972. It was a merger of the municipal borough of Richmond with the Aysgarth Rural District, Leyburn Rural District, Reeth Rural District and Richmond Rural District along with part of the Croft Rural District, all in the North Riding of Yorkshire. Political Control 2003 to 2005 The Council was controlled by independent councillors until May 2003, when elections returned a council with no overall control (Conservative 11; Independent 9; Liberal Democrats 8; Richmondshire Independent Group 5; Social Democratic Party 1). Conservative Cllr John Blackie was elected as leader of the Council. 2005 to 2019 In December 2005 Cllr Blackie was replaced by the leader of the Independent Coalition for Richmondshire, Cllr Bill Glover, following the resignation of several councillors from the Conservative group and the merger of the rival independent groups. As of January 2019, the 34 member council was controlled by a Conservative administration. The Chairman was Cllr Bill Glover and the Vice Chairman was Cllr Stuart Parsons. May 2019 Following the local elections in May 2019 a new Independent-Liberal Democrat-Green coalition took power, under the umbrella name 'Richmond Together'. This followed all up elections on new boundaries, which saw the Liberal Democrats gain two seats compared to their previous count of one seat and the Greens gain their first seat on Richmondshire Council. Together with nine of the Independent councillors, this gave the 'Richmond Together' coalition a working majority over the Conservatives and one stand-alone Independent in opposition. May 2020 The Green Party councillor, Cllr Kevin Foster, has since left the 'Richmond Together' alliance and formed a new group of two, alongside the stand-alone Independent, in opposition. Meanwhile, the Conservative Cllr Pat Middlemiss, who represents Scotton, has left the Conservative opposition group and joined 'Richmondshire Together' administration as an Independent. Overall, this increases the Independents within the 'Richmond Together' alliance to 10 seats, decreases the Conservatives to 9 seats and leaves the administration's working majority unchanged.

Set within a community affected by the life of Tupac Shakur, the novel follows three young girls as they group up in that community. The novel received a Newbery Medal Honor in 2009 and won the American Library Association Award and the 2009 Josette Frank Award. Plot summary After Tupac And D Foster is based on three girls: two black eleven year old girls, Neeka and the anonymous narrator, and D Foster, who was of mixed race and had just moved into Neeka and the narrator's neighborhood in Queens, New York. Their experiences are set within a world impacted by Tupac Shakur, describing events and experiences in his life during the mid 1990s, such as run-ins with the cops and events that foreshadowed his death. Growing up together on the same block of their safe neighborhood, Neeka and the narrator have been friends since birth. When D. Foster first moved into a house on their block, her initial impression as unconventional and different had left the two girls in a bit of shock, as well as their mothers hesitant to let them interact with her. However, they then discovered that they both were greatly influenced by Tupac Shakur's music which caused the three girls to gradually develop a lasting friendship. Later in their teens, Foster opens up to her two close friends about her alcoholic mother who had abandoned her as a child, leaving her in the care of constantly changing foster homes. She also shares with them the news of her biological Mother now wanting her back. However, relating her relationship with her Mother to that of Tupac's and his Mother, Foster realizes that even through the conflicting relationship, there is still love.

Format The series is the successor of Canada's Worst Handyman and has a broadly similar format, but with an emphasis on rewarding competent handiwork rather than finding the nation's worst handyman. The couples are divided into teams, who are each tasked with undertaking a number of handiwork-related challenges, with the overall goal of improving their skills and confidence. At the end of each episode, the most improved couple is awarded a prize (unlike Canada's Worst Handyman, no one is named the worst). At the end of the series, a $50,000 cash prize is given to the most improved couple as voted on by the public.Bell Media: Press Release Contestants * Steve Garner and Richelene Bautista are a young couple from Winnipeg, Manitoba who, by their own admission, are in serious need of an education in handiwork. Steve's projects around the house have almost all ended in failure and Richelene has virtually no knowledge of tools or handiwork whatsoever. * Jesse Graham and Holly Dusome are a young couple from Penetanguishene, Ontario who are rapidly discovering the limits of their handiwork abilities when trying to adapt their house for their young family. Both have different opinions on what their primary problem is, with Jesse considering Holly a control freak and Holly in turn accusing Jesse of being too sloppy and not planning enough. * Danielle Routliffe and Tyler Routliffe are a husband and wife from Woodstock, Ontario who met as children, but fail to see eye-to-eye on handiwork. Danielle considers herself to be very capable, but Tyler is worried about her destructive tendencies and habit of abandoning jobs. * Jake Sharma and Nicole Sharma are a husband and wife from Mission, British Columbia who have a house that is full of incomplete jobs, including exposed wiring and incomplete plumbing. Jake is convinced that he's a good enough handyman to someday start his own business, but Nicole is less convinced. * Fabian Sprik and Luayn Sprik are a husband and wife who live in a former hotel in Teeterville, Ontario. Fabian dreams of restoring it to its former glory, but so far has accomplished little, much to Luayn's annoyance. Synopsis {  - ! Team !!

The Red Team seemingly manage this challenge well despite a lack of communication between Fabian and Luayn, but then realise that they've made a terrible mistake by building the table far away from their cabin, with no consideration as to whether or not it will fit in. As a result, they have to resort to chopping off a large chunk of the legs, resulting in a very low table and ruining what would otherwise have been a respectable performance. On the Pink Team, Danielle insists on going ahead without measuring or even marking the wood, and Tyler's insistence that she do the job properly results in a stormy build, and a table that's of barely passable quality. The Green Team are the only ones who go to the trouble of measuring the example table built by the experts, but Jake's imprecise measurements and troubles with getting to grips to the tools result in a very haphazard-looking table that noticeably sags in the middle. Much to the experts' alarm, Jake gets Nicole to act as a human brace while he screws the top into the frame. The Purple Team's table proves to be by far the worst, as the inexperience of both Steve and Richelene, along with the former's lackadaisical attitude and the latter's nervousness, results in a table so poor that it totally falls apart when being viewed by the experts. The Blue Team perform easily the best, as despite Jesse's somewhat brusque leadership, their table is completed quickly and to a very solid standard. As a result, their table is judged to be clearly the best and they are named the first challenge winners, and co-forepersons for the next challenge. * Team Challenge: The Fire Pit and the Swinging Chair: The candidates are split into teams of men and women, with Jesse leading the men, and Holly leading the women. The men are tasked with building a fire pit from bricks, mortar and gravel, while the women have to assemble a flat-packed wooden swinging chair. Construction on the fire pit generally proceeds smoothly thanks to the work of Jake, who had already built a similar fire pit for his home, though he soon finds himself having to do the entire project, with the other men, especially Tyler, taking a backseat. Holly predicts that the chair build will go smoothly because \\"women follow instructions,\\" but a power struggle soon emerges between her and Danielle, who insists that they don't need the instructions and that they should push on ahead. As a result, Nicole steps in and supervises the project to completion. The following day, the swinging chair is found to be able to hold four people (even though it was only designed for two), while the fire pit easily withstands a lawnmower being driven into it. Though it's noted that both Jesse and Holly did relatively well as leaders, Jake and Nicole are judged to be the standout performers, and so the Green Team are named the second challenge winners, giving them an advantage for the next challenge. * Toilet Replacement: For the third and final challenge of the episode, the teams each have an hour (except for the Green Team, who have an extra 10 minutes) to remove the toilets from their cabins, and replace them with new ones. As an added challenge, one member of the team must remove the old toilet, and then the other must install the new toilet with no help from their partner. Whoever completes their installation to an acceptable standard (measured by being able to flush a bowl of popcorn) in the shortest amount of time wins. Despite Jake managing to get the old toilet out even before the 10-minute headstart is up, the Green Team rapidly falls apart among infighting between him and Nicole, who even threatens her husband with physical violence. They end up taking a total of 57 minutes to finish the job, with Jake noting that if not for their headstart, they would have been in serious danger of not finishing the job at all. The Pink Team fare little better, with tensions continuing to run high between Danielle and Tyler. They finish a little faster at 55 minutes, but their toilet doesn't flush quite as well as most of the others (though still does it well enough to be considered a pass). Jesse refuses to trust Holly to install their toilet and so ends up doing both halves of the Blue Team's job, in violation of the challenge rules; they complete it in 43 minutes. Things go very smoothly for the Red Team, who complete their job in 36 minutes thanks to Fabian having done this job before. However, they're pipped to the post by the Purple Team, as Steve's unorthodox approach of fully assembling the toilet before installing it pays off, resulting in them finishing in 33 minutes and being named the challenge winners. Because they each won a challenge, the Blue, Green and Purple Teams are nominated as the best of the episode. In the end, the experts note that the Green Team totally imploded in the episode's final challenge, and decide that Jesse's violation of the rules in the same challenge cannot be ignored. This means that the Purple Team are the first to be named the best of the episode, as they got better and better in every challenge, and the experts were extremely impressed with Richelene in particular, for showing by far the most improvement of any of the contestants. She and Steve are rewarded with a Japanese \\"Smart Toilet\\" worth $3,000.  Episode 2: What's Up, Dock?  :Original airdate: April 20, 2015 * Window Installation: In the episode's first challenge, each team is required to remove the old single-pane windows from the kitchen area of their cabin, and install a double-glazed replacement. Since the new windows are larger than the ones they are replacing, each team will have to cut larger holes to fit the windows in. The installations will be tested by the experts spraying the window with a fire hose. The Pink Team prove to be by far the worst performers in this challenge, as uncertainty over how they should proceed and arguments between Danielle and Tyler see the project rapidly descend into total chaos. Matters nearly come to a head when Tyler comes dangerously close to slicing through a live electrical cable, and his carelessness and Danielle's screaming reaction causes an argument between the duo and Hillary. They take so long to cut their hole that the challenge ends before they can even attempt to install the window, and Danielle and Tyler are forced to take the full force of the fire hose through the empty hole as punishment for their failure. The Blue, Green and Purple teams all complete the job to a reasonable standard (albeit with Jake and Nicole on the Green Team continuing to argue fiercely during their project), but their windows leak due to inadequate usage of the expanding spray foam. At first sight the Red Team's window seems badly askew, but the experts are shocked to find that the window itself is actually perfectly level; the rest of their hut is in fact what's not level. The window itself holds up perfectly to the fire hose test, and so the team are named the winners of this challenge. * Team Challenge: The Floating Dock: Fabian and Luayn are placed in charge of an ambitious project to build a floating dock from lumber and foam flotation blocks. Unlike the gender split in the previous week, the teams can be divided up in any way, and Luayn supervises the Blue and Purple teams in cutting the lumber to size, while Fabian has the Green and Pink teams handling preliminary assembly work. During this phase, Hillary notices Steve using the power tools in an unsafe manner, and consequently bars him from using them for the rest of the challenge, entrusting Richelene to do the job instead. Work is initially slow, and further delayed when Fabian notices that the dock's frame has been put together poorly, forcing the teams to take it apart and reassemble it. When the dock is eventually finished (with a diving board added as an extra embellishment), the teams are faced with the difficult task of getting it into the water, a problem which Nicole solves. After some additional work reinforcing the structure, it goes into the lake and successfully floats, and even stands up to all the contestants attempting to capsize it standing on one side of it. For the second week in a row, the standout couples are felt to be the Green Team and the task leaders (the Red Team), the former for being the most valuable contributors, and the latter for successfully organizing a very difficult project. This time however, the decision swings in the direction of the task leaders, and the Red Team win their second successive challenge. * Outdoor Showers: For this challenge, the teams are each tasked with building a hand pump-powered outdoor shower for their hut within a 90-minute time limit (100 minutes for the Red Team, as a reward for winning the previous challenge), though are thrown a curveball by being given no instructions, only the required materials. Whoever finishes to the required standard first wins. The Blue Team's build soon falls apart due to arguments between Jesse and Holly, eventually causing Jesse to storm off the project. He eventually returns, but not in time to save the project, which they fail to complete in the allotted time. The experts judge the work that they did complete to be actually quite good, but tell them that teamwork is clearly a major issue for them, and one that needs to be resolved if they are to succeed. The Pink Team experiences another troublesome project, which immediately gets off to a difficult start due to Tyler insisting on creating a detailed plan, but Danielle not believing a plan is necessary at all. They end up being unable to get their hand pump working, and so resort to attaching a hose to their kitchen taps. The shower works, but is the last to be finished, barely making the 90 minute time limit. The Red Team squander their head start through a lack of planning, and it takes Fabian and Luayn a long time to get things together and build their shower. The result is arguably the closest to the shower the experts were expecting the teams to build, though is very rickety. Like last week, the Purple Team take an unorthodox approach by assembling their frame upside-down, using tall sheets of corrugated steel for the shower walls rather than the wooden panelling used by most of the other teams, and having their shower spray out upwards to provide a \\"rain\\" effect. The result is very solid overall, though the time spent righting the frame prevents them finishing in first place. Victory therefore is claimed by the Green Team, as Jake and Nicole are able to put their differences aside and build their shower relatively quickly; while they stick the pump at the opposite end of the water line to most of the other couples (meaning that their shower needs a second person to pump the water), this is still considered acceptable by the experts. This week, only two teams are in consideration for the most improved, namely the Green and Red Teams. While Hillary argues that the Green Team should be named the best for working better together than they had done in the past, and also argues that the Red Team's rickety shower should preclude them from being named the best, Rob and Helder ultimately agree on naming the Red Team as the best, for winning two challenges and doing generally very solid work across the episode. Fabian and Luayn are awarded with a $1,000 diving board, though are befuddled as to what they'd actually use it for.  Episode 3: The Walls Come Tumbling Down  :Original airdate: April 27, 2015 * Bunk Beds: Each team must convert the two bedrooms of their cabins into a single, larger bedroom with a bunk bed. To do this, the teams must knock out the dividing walls, and then assemble the beds from scratch. In keeping with their tradition of unorthodox approaches to projects, the Purple Team build their beds outside of the cabin, with the bottom bunk being free-standing, and the top bunk held in place by a chain hung from the ceiling. Unfortunately, the two mis-measure and find that their beds don't fit in the way they originally intended, forcing them to be placed at right-angles. This, along with the fact that Steve resorted to just smashing the dividing wall with his boots rather than using the reciprocating saw (as everyone else did), cements their performance in this challenge as the worst. In what is rapidly becoming a familiar pattern, the Pink Team is slowed down drastically in the early stages due to Danielle and Tyler's bickering over what approach to take to the project. Despite their continued arguments they do finish the bed in time, but are criticized for the very small gap between the two bunks. Conversely, the Red Team has a very harmonious build, but their bunks turn out to be too far apart, 15 inches over the recommended distance. The Blue Team manages to build what in most aspects is the best bed, with railings and a ladder, but miss out on top spot due to forgetting to add a brace to the top bunk, along with the horrible working atmosphere between Jesse and Holly. Therefore, the Green Team, who managed to work together well after some initial arguments between Jake and Nicole, and also ended up making an overall very solid bed, are named the winners of this challenge. * Team Challenge: The Gazebo: Jake and Nicole are given the job of leading the contestants through the task of building a prefabricated gazebo, along with making a picnic table from scratch, and building a barbecue out of an old oil drum. Jake assigns Fabian and Jesse to build the picnic table which, despite getting very little direction from Jake, they complete without any trouble. The barbecue is mostly handled by Steve, who also manages to finish it without any trouble, though considers Jake's leadership to be more than a little nitpicky. Nicole leads the remaining contestants in assembling the gazebo, and quickly gets very flustered and snappy, causing the build to progress slowly. Things speed up once the remaining contestants join them, despite Nicole continuing to maintain a negative attitude. However, after having already witnessed several safety violations (including Jesse and Fabian both needing to be reminded to wear eye protection, and Jake's unsafe use of the angle grinder), Rob drags everyone aside to reprimand them for failing to wear the safety gloves that they were specifically instructed to use. He warns them of dire consequences should he see any more safety violations, but minutes later Fabian is caught without his gloves on a critical part of the build. An infuriated Rob immediately shuts the build down and declares the project a failure; consequently, no team is named the best for this task, and no-one gets an advantage for the next challenge. * Boat Lifts: The third and final challenge for this episode gives each team 90 minutes to assemble a boat lift from a combination of a kit, and lumber that each team must cut to size. Whoever completes their boat lift in the fastest time to an acceptable standard will win. For the second episode in a row, the Blue Team fails to finish a challenge due to Jesse and Holly's inability to work together, and unlike the previous week, the experts tell them that their boat lift would likely not have been deemed acceptable even if it were finished due to the generally poor workmanship. The Green Team actually manage to finish in the second-fastest time after yet another row between Jake and Nicole (which causes the latter to briefly storm out), but their lift is not considered up to scratch by the experts, due to it being far too small (to the extent where it can only barely hold a child's canoe) and having various other faults. The Red Team are the slowest of the teams who actually complete the job, due to confusion over the tools needed; their boat lift turns out to be of generally passable quality, though is a little wider than it needs to be. The Purple Team decide to save time by building their lift from offcuts from the Pink Team's lumber, and the experts have no major criticisms of their work. However, they're beaten to first place by the Pink Team themselves, as Danielle and Tyler finally manage to work together harmoniously, agree on a definite plan for the job, and finish it quickly. Before naming the most improved team, the experts drop a bombshell; prior to the final episode, two teams will be eliminated. They do not tell the teams how or when this will occur, but hint that as of now, they consider the Blue Team to be the worst of the five due to leaving jobs unfinished and having shown no improvement in their ability to work together. The Red Team are also privately concerned that any repeat of their careless safety violations could result in them being thrown off the show if they commit a bad enough mistake. Again, there are two teams in consideration for best, namely the Green and Pink Teams. Hilary argues that the Green Team should be named the best, as they've been consistently strong until now, and are making major progress toward working together better, despite the occasional argument. Helder, on the other hand, feels that the Pink Team deserve to be named the best as a reward for turning their act around this episode, after their generally dreadful performances in the first two episodes. In the end, Rob sides with Helder, and the Green Team are passed over for the third time in a row, with the Pink Team being named the best. Their reward is an outdoor Sicilian pizza oven, and while Danielle admits that she has no idea how to make pizza, she says that she's going to learn it now.  Episode 4: Thrown for a Coop  :Original airdate: May 4, 2015 * Roof Repairs: A large hole has been made in each cabin and the teams must repair these holes by cutting the hole into a larger, square gap, cutting plywood to fit the gap, and then covering the plywood with a waterproof membrane and shingles. One member of the team will go atop the roof of the cabin and handle the bulk of the work, while the other will mostly handle prep work and anything that needs to be done inside the cabin. The tensions that have been building between Jake and Nicole on the Green Team continue to be a major problem, and when combined with Nicole's fear of heights and near-total lack of knowledge on how to use a power saw (with all three experts having to instruct her during the course of the challenge), they fail to get past cutting their initial gap. The Purple Team does a generally creditable job despite Richelene having some minor problems cutting the plywood, but are sharply criticised for wasting materials; in particular, their cabin had a thicker roof than the others, which they even out by adding several layers of shingles, instead of just shimming out the difference with the plywood. The Pink Team also does well, with Danielle conquering her fear of working in high places, though they are found to have a few loose tiles; an easy problem to fix, but one that precludes them from winning. The actual best job is done by the Red Team, with Fabian's repair job being virtually seamless; because he refused to let Luayn do any of the work however, they are not rewarded with top spot for the challenge. That honour goes to the Blue Team, who rebound from the heavy criticisms they got in the previous episode, work together harmoniously and finish the job near- flawlessly. * Team Challenge: The Teeter-Totter: Because Jesse, Jake, Danielle, Steve and Fabian are considered the nominal leaders of their respective teams, they are told to stand aside and let each of their partners work together in constructing a child's teeter-totter from supplied materials. Despite the Blue Team winning the previous challenge, Holly is not placed in charge of the build, and the five instead come to a consensus on how they should build it. Richelene and Tyler take the lead on cutting the materials to size, while Holly, Luayn and Nicole handle the assembly work. The build subsequently goes with no major problems at all, the only real issue being some brief confusion over the instructions, which Tyler helps to clear up, and the teeter-totter is finished on time and to a high standard. The lead team members are suitably impressed, until the experts drop a bombshell; they have to work together to build the same teeter-totter their partners just built, without any instructions. They end up having to use the scrap lumber left over from the first teeter-totter to get an idea on the dimensions, with Steve handling the seats, and the remaining four cutting the lumber. Despite having been asleep for most of the initial build, Steve takes point on assembling their teeter-totter, remembering the details and dimensions of the first one. Though the team builds a very close copy of it, their finished product has a fatal flaw in that they built the base far too narrow, resulting in it being so unstable that it can barely even stand up unsupported, and leading to the partner team being named the clear winners. Due to the challenge being designed primarily to help the partners, and the two best performers being from different original teams (Tyler in the first part, and Steve in the second), no individual team is named the winner. * Chicken Coops: The episode's third and final challenge requires each team to build a chicken coop. The teams are required to provide at least 4 square feet per bird, and make it both escape-proof and predator-proof, but otherwise are free to design it however they want. The Blue Team get a 10-minute headstart for winning the first challenge, and the remaining teams each have 90 minutes. Due to the scope of this challenge, the teams are each given the full amount of time rather than the usual criteria of whoever finishes first winning. Most of the teams get far too ambitious, trying to build huge coops including a separate house and yard. As a result, the Blue, Pink and Purple teams all fail to get anywhere near completing their coops. The Pink Team performs the worst, as Danielle and Tyler descend into arguing, and get almost nothing accomplished, while the Blue Team fares little better due to Holly losing her confidence and letting Jesse make all the key decisions. The Purple Team, despite a late push, fail to recover from a slow start and still have a lot unfinished. The Red Team come close to finishing, but their overly ambitious attempt to build the largest coop and an argument late on between Fabian and Luayn sees them narrowly fail. Therefore, the Green Team, who were the only ones to fully understand the challenge and build a modest home for the chickens, along with managing to keep the arguments between Jake and Nicole under control (using a \\"safe word\\" technique they learned from the Pink Team), are by far and away the best performers in this challenge, and easily named the winners. The Blue and Green Teams are in contention for the episode's best and the experts quickly come to a unanimous decision. While the Blue Team certainly improved their teamwork a lot in the first challenge, they slipped back into their old ways in the third challenge and the experts agree that ultimately, how the teams finish an episode is more important than how they start it. Therefore, it's fourth time lucky for the Green Team, whose impeccable work on the chicken coop sees them finally named the most improved couple of the week after three near-misses. For their victory, Jake and Nicole are awarded a high-end set of carving knives and roasting pans, along with a supply of whole, frozen chickens.  Episode 5: Lights! Paneling! Action!  :Original airdate: May 12, 2015 * Wall insulation: For this episode's first challenge, the teams must tear down one of the walls in their cabins, place fibreglass insulation in the gaps (cutting and installing extra wall studs if needed), place a vapour barrier over the insulation and then add in new wall panelling. Despite the teams being explicitly told that they are to install their insulation in a wall that has two windows, Jake ignores this instruction and decides to install it in the corner of the kitchen, even as Nicole (and later Rob when he drops by to see how they're doing) tries to remind him of the instructions. On top of that, the two fail to install the needed extra studs, and affix their wall panelling so poorly that a small tug from Hillary brings it all falling down, cementing the Green Team as the worst in this challenge. The Purple Team do an okay job of attaching their wall panelling and vapour barrier, but resort to haphazardly stuffing chunks of insulation in the wall instead of cutting it to size, which the experts tell them is a waste of materials and will not insulate effectively. The Blue and Red Teams both get their insulation and vapour barriers installed correctly, but their wall panelling is visibly loose in places; the Red Team also have issues with Fabian and Luayn working together. The Pink Team, therefore, are named the winners, as while their job wasn't perfect by any means (in particular, they left large, obvious joins between their sheets of wall panelling), it was still the best of the five teams. * Outdoor Floodlights: Instead of the usual team challenge, this episode has the five lead members of each team (and Tyler, as a reward for the Pink Team's victory in the previous challenge) attend a lesson on how to install an outdoor security floodlight, controlled by a switch inside the cabin. They will then be tasked with instructing their partners on how to install the floodlight on their cabins, with the caveat that the lead members cannot take any hands-on role, and will be ejected from the cabin if they set hands on the job even once (something that would ultimately happen to every team leader except for Fabian). The Green Team again performs the worst, as Jake bizarrely insists that Nicole install the switch in the middle of the cabin rather than by the door, something that she eventually corrects, but costs them valuable time. Additionally, Nicole fails to properly mount the light due to losing some of the necessary screws, and does such a poor wiring job that not only do two switches have to be turned on to switch on the light when only one should be necessary, the circuit isn't even grounded, resulting in the experts declaring the job unsafe and refusing to test it. The Purple Team has a stormy build, with Richelene twice trying to give up due to the stress caused by the installation. She, too, fails to properly ground her circuit, and her job is also not tested by the experts. Despite Fabian not actually being ejected, he proves very controlling and argues a lot with Luayn. While the Red Team's light is installed mostly correctly, Luayn fails to correctly recess the mounting box, which will require additional work to make it waterproof. Tyler does a generally very solid job with the Pink Team's light, but like Luayn, initially fails to realise that the box should be recessed. Tyler does try to correct the issue, but runs out of time and only succeeds in recessing it about halfway. The Blue Team are therefore the winners, as Jesse's clear instructions (despite getting thrown out of the cabin) and Holly's intelligent approach to the job leads to the job being completed to a near-perfect standard. * Kitchen Cabinets: Each team has to install a set of prefabricated cabinets in their cabin's kitchens, a task which will require one of the walls to be knocked out in order to expand the kitchen. Though the teams are permitted some autonomy in this job, they are informed that their kitchens must be based around a \\"triangle\\" layout made up of the sink, the fridge and the dishwasher, and that any kitchen which does not conform to this layout will be judged a failure. The teams each have three hours, with the Blue Team getting an extra ten minutes thanks to their challenge victory. All of the teams have major problems figuring out how to make the triangle layout work due to the very limited space available in the kitchens. In the end, the Green, Pink and Purple Teams all fail to complete the job, with the Green and Pink Teams being brought down by teamwork issues (the Green Team also discovering that the fridge they were supplied with will not even fit through the doors to their kitchen), and the Purple Team failing to realise that their cupboards are supposed to have drawers incorporated into them until Hillary specifically informs them of this, which happens too late for them to regroup and finish. The Blue Team finish their kitchen on-time and to a generally decent standard, but the experts find several careless mistakes, including at least one cupboard having its handle mounted on the same side as the hinges. The Red Team finish their kitchen with no major faults noted and so are named the winners of this challenge. Though the Blue, Pink and Red Teams are shortlisted for the title of the episode's most improved, the Pink Team are immediately removed from consideration due to their failure to complete the third challenge, whereas the Blue and Red Teams completed all three. Though Rob favours the Red Team for doing well in all the challenges and completing the most complex challenge (the kitchen) flawlessly, Helder and Hillary agree that Fabian still needs to work on his leadership style, and that Jesse and Holly have done a good job of addressing their previously very poor teamwork. The Blue Team are named the most improved, something which the experts admitted that three episodes ago they didn't see ever happening, and Jesse and Holly are awarded a high-end kitchen sink and garbage disposer, which Jesse immediately resolves to install when the two get home.  Episode 6: That Sinking Feeling  :Original airdate: May 18, 2015 * The Kitchen Sink: The experts jokingly tell the teams that because they've installed \\"everything but the kitchen sink\\" so far on the show, an actual kitchen sink will be the next thing that they install. Rob gives the teams a lengthy lesson beforehand, emphasizing that the sinks must be installed to code, especially the trap, before giving them two hours to get the job done. Despite seemingly getting through the job without a hitch, the Blue Team's sink fails to work due to the water pipe getting kinked in the installation, causing them to finish in last place by default, much to Jesse's anger. The Pink Team are heavily criticised for failing to use the supplied template for their sink, along with their extremely messy and ugly plumbing; Rob berates them for the latter, accusing them of laziness and telling them that they will be eliminated before the final if they maintain this approach. Similarly, the Green Team are taken to task for their extremely loose sink (a consequence of not using the template) and leaving a large, obvious hole in the side of the cabinet, where Jake cut an incorrectly-located hole for their water line. The Red Team seemingly get through the job without any major trouble, but make two big mistakes, not only discarding the template (and resultantly cutting another hole that's too big, albeit not as much as the Green Team's) but attaching the hot and cold lines to the wrong taps. While the Purple Team have the huge additional job of having to run water from the other side of their hut to the new kitchen, which ultimately proves too much and keeps them from finishing the whole job, the experts are nonetheless hugely complimentary of the work that they did do, saying that they cannot find a single fault. As a result, the Purple Team are named the winners of this challenge. * Walkways and Flagpoles: The teams are each tasked with laying a concrete walkway to their cabins, along with erecting a flagpole. The flagpole's hole will have to be dug out using a mechanical auger, to a depth of 23 inches. Helder gives the teams a lesson, and emphasizes the importance of safety. The twist is that the teams each only get the first 10 minutes working together and then have to alternate \\"tag team\\" style, which means that the holes must be dug in the first 10 minutes due to the requirement for two people to operate the auger. Immediately after the first team switch is called out, Steve commits a serious violation of the safety regulations by attempting to operate the auger himself after failing to reach the required 23-inch depth in the initial 10 minutes. Helder is enraged by this, and even more by the fact that not only does he have to yell at Steve four times before he shuts the auger off, Steve then gets in Helder's face and shouts about the challenge being unfair. Steve continues to argue the point, eventually resulting in Richelene having to step in and talk him down; Steve then angrily throws the auger aside, and \\"accidentally\\" breaks the team's shovel when attempting to continue digging the hole, before demanding to use the auger again, and then angrily throwing his building supplies around the cabin. Realising that Steve's behaviour has disrupted the challenge too badly for it to continue (in particular, the Pink and Blue Teams, located next to the Purple Team, both stopped working and were left visibly shaken), the experts call a halt to the challenge. No one is declared the winner. After the challenge ends, the experts summon all the teams and announce that while they were originally going to eliminate the weakest team at the end of this episode, Steve's actions have changed all that. The experts berate Steve, telling him that his actions were wholly unacceptable, likening him to a \\"hooligan,\\" before bluntly telling the Purple Team that they are expelled with immediate effect and to leave the site at once. As the Purple Team are driven away, Richelene is visibly distraught, while Steve's only comment is that his outburst was how he typically resolves his temper issues and that he would not have physically struck Helder. * Wall- mounted Shelves: While the remaining four teams are still in shock from Steve's abrupt meltdown, the experts tell them immediately after eliminating the Purple Team that they will be proceeding onto the next challenge regardless. This requires them to build a set of shelves from supplied lumber, based on a model that Hillary shows them; furthermore, she informs them that the shelves must be precisely 2.5x the size of the model. She also gives the teams a lesson in using routers, which must be used to cut dadoes to fit the wood together. The teams each have 90 minutes in which to make their shelves (the Purple Team would have gotten a headstart, but due to their elimination every team gets the same amount of time). Calculating the required size trips up most of the teams, with Fabian mistakenly thinking it's supposed to be 3x the model size, Tyler incorrectly working out the required width as 29\\" instead of 32.5\\" (though he corrects it before he and Danielle begin cutting the wood), and Jake insisting over Nicole's objections that they don't need to replicate the expert's model in exact detail. The Green Team's shelves end up bearing next to no resemblance to what they were asked to build, but are nonetheless quite well-made, and Jake and Nicole were noted to have worked together better than usual. The Red Team, despite finishing well in advance of any of the other teams and having very solid workmanship, is ultimately undermined by Fabian's measuring errors. While the Blue Team's shelves are a little too far away from the reference model for the experts' liking, their overall build quality is judged to be the best in the challenge. The Pink Team overcome a very stormy build and frequent arguments between Danielle and Tyler to build shelves that are a near-perfect match for what the experts requested. Due to the Purple Team's ejection and no winner being declared in the walkway and flagpole challenge, the best couple ultimately comes down solely to the shelving challenge, with all four teams being nominated for the best. The experts ultimately decide that while workmanship is important, the ability to follow instructions correctly is even more vital (especially given that the argument that ultimately saw the Purple Team expelled started out over Steve's refusal to follow the instructions) and thus the Pink Team become the first to be named the best for a second time, something that visibly disgruntles the other teams. The Pink Team's reward is a pair of Canadian flags; a small, tabletop flag for Tyler and a gigantic flag (big enough to cover up the site's central stage) for Danielle.  Episode 7: Door-to-Door Service  :Original airdate: May 26, 2015 * Front Doors: Since each of the teams was forced to destroy the front door of their cabins in order to gain access on the first day, they are each asked to replace not only the door, but its frame as well. While the team will be supplied with a pre-made door, they will be required to build the frame from scratch, as well as fitting hinges to the door and frame. The Blue Team mismeasure and build their frame too large, as do the Pink Team. While the Pink Team resort to just jamming shims in to even out the difference (something that the expert sharply criticize them for), the Blue Team end up remaking their entire frame, which takes up so much time that they fail to come anywhere close to finishing. Nonetheless, the experts compliment the Blue Team for the high quality of the work that they did finish, and note that Jesse and Holly have developed what appears to be the strongest team dynamic. The Green Team get the job finished, but the door is a little tight, and more significantly they did not build a new frame and re-used the existing one. While the experts are critical of this, and even more so of the fact that it took them 75 minutes before getting anything accomplished on the job, they nonetheless accept Jake's reasoning that the door frame was supporting the roof, and would have been too dangerous to remove outright. The Red Team, who felt that they had a point to prove in this challenge, successfully replace their door (a more difficult task than faced by most of the other teams, due to their unlevel cabin), almost perfectly, the only major issue being messy usage of expanding spray foam. This results in Fabian and Luayn easily being named the challenge winners. * Cabin Signs: The teams are each given a large log, which they are asked to cut at least one cross-section out of and then use to build a sign. The Red Team are given use of a chainsaw as a reward for their victory in the previous challenge, while the remaining teams have to make do with two-person crosscut saws. The Pink Team are slowed down severely when Tyler has major difficulty cutting a maple leaf from the cross-section, with Helder commenting that the result looks more like a fan than a maple leaf. This results in them being the only one of the four teams who fail to finish, and adding insult to injury, the experts point out that they misspelled their team motto on the sign. The Green Team also get slowed down, in their case through trouble using the crosscut saws; they do finish however, and the experts compliment them on their clearly heartfelt design, though have issues with the quality of workmanship. The Red Team make full use of their chainsaw and finish well ahead of the other teams, but their sign, while otherwise well-made, receives some criticism for its unambitious design. The Blue Team are therefore victorious, as Holly's creative design (which showcases nearly all the skills that the teams have learned until now) and her strong working dynamic with Jesse results in what the experts judge the best sign. * Range Hoods: In a departure from the usual procedure, the experts first reveal that the Blue Team's advantage is being able to make one of the other teams start the challenge fifteen minutes later than the rest and they immediately choose the Red Team, who they regard as their biggest threat. The Blue, Green and Pink Teams are then sent to their cabins, where they discover that the task involves installing a range hood, which entails attaching it to wall studs, connecting it to the electrical supply and then creating a hole for the hood's exhaust. The teams have 90 minutes (except for the Red Team, who have 75). Believing that they can beat the Red Team regardless, Holly deliberately nullifies the Red Team's disadvantage by openly telling them what the task is. Hillary tells Holly that while this is technically not a violation of the challenge rules, she just threw away their advantage and Jesse is also less than thrilled to learn what Holly did. Shockingly, three of the four teams end up failing the job. The Green Team fails to finish at all, due to problems with their kitchen layout and continuing arguments between Jake and Nicole. While the Blue Team end up being the first to finish, the modifications they made to the hood render the fan unable to spin, which ends up destroying the motor. The Pink Team's hood also fails to work, due to Tyler inadvertently damaging the electrical connections during the installation, and not being able to repair them in time. Despite the Red Team's initial disadvantage and being further slowed down when Luayn accidentally sustains a deep cut to her hand, the team rally and finish the job flawlessly and so are the obvious winners. With the Red Team having won the first and third challenges and the Blue Team winning the second, the two teams are nominated for best of the episode. Despite Holly's actions in the previous challenge, Hillary feels that they were the best of the four teams for their consistently strong teamwork and showing more ambition than the other teams. However, Rob and Helder feel that the Red Team are the overwhelmingly obvious choice to be named the best, as they did very well in all the challenges, have overcome their previous teamwork problems and were the only team to win two challenges this week. Their reward is a $2,400 gasoline-powered chainsaw with a 60-inch blade, something which both Fabian and Luayn are thrilled to receive.  Episode 8: Chip off the old Cabin  : Original airdate: June 1, 2015 * The Bar: After reminding the contestants that the weakest team will be eliminated this episode, the experts reveal that whoever wins this challenge will be immune from elimination this week and guaranteed entry to the finale. The challenge entails building a bar with a curved copper top, a built-in cooler and storage space for a good selection of drinks. The Green Team's build proves highly problematic, due to Jake initially refusing to discuss his proposed design (which doesn't even have an entry point for the bartender) and then frequent clashes between him and Nicole when he does let her get involved. Though they manage to finish the project after a late rush, it proves to be the least impressive of the four bars by some distance. The Red Team gets slowed down initially due to the complex carpentry they opt to use; this does result in them having the best shelves, but leaves them short on time to install the cooler, which Luayn achieves by crudely slicing out part of the worktop and hammering the cooler in, bringing down an otherwise very solid performance. For once, the Pink Team has easily the most harmonious build, as Tyler's clear plan and simple-but-solid design lead to them finishing with minimal fuss. Their only shortcoming is forgetting to factor the cooler into their design. Despite initial problems caused by Holly's ambitious plan to slice a boat in half and build their bar from it, the Blue Team soon pull together and finish their bar to a near-perfect standard. The experts note this to be the closest decision yet, with the Blue, Pink and Red Teams all doing very solid work, but ultimately the Blue Team wins out due to their greater ambition and generally good workmanship, to the frustration of the Pink and especially Red Teams, making the Blue Team the first to enter the finale. * Water Heaters: Rob gives the teams a lesson in installing a water heater, connecting it to the water lines, and installing a GFCI outlet to power the heater. The Blue Team is given the option of sitting this challenge out since they are guaranteed to be in the final no matter what, but they decide that the opportunity to attempt the job in this setting is one they shouldn't pass up. The teams each have two hours to complete the job, and must use the spot marked by the experts. The Blue Team quickly become overconfident due to their immunity, and Jesse's carelessness when using the blowtorch results in him causing a small fire, forcing the crew to step in and extinguish it. Their build is immediately shut down, with the experts telling Jesse and Holly that had they not been immune, they would have faced some form of punishment. As for the teams actually competing in the challenge, the Pink Team have easily the most harmonious build, despite Danielle's confusion over the water connections. They finish on-time and the water heater itself works fine, but their shut-off valve turns out to leak. The experts note that it should be a simple fix, but Danielle and Tyler are worried that this small mistake could cost them. Fabian on the Red Team comes dangerously close to causing a fire himself, after getting frustrated while trying to solder the pipes together; nonetheless, their heater works perfectly, with no leaks or any other problems. After a build that is a little less stormy than usual (though Nicole's recommendation that they use the bar top for soldering results in them making a huge mess of solder and flux), the Green Team's heater fails to power on. When Helder inspects the GFCI outlet it turns out that Nicole accidentally connected the electrical wires to the outlet's ground terminals. Both she and Jake are devastated by this, realizing that unless one of the other teams messed up even worse, this mistake has likely cost them their place in the competition. Despite the implication that the elimination decision would be based solely on the previous challenge, the experts ultimately decide to base it on the entire history of the three teams so far. While the Red Team is noted to be clearly the most talented of the three and Luayn receives much praise for a huge improvement, all three experts are still worried about Fabian, feeling that he's shown little (if any) improvement since the start of the season. The Pink Team are complimented for the overall progress they've made after their awful early performances, though Rob still feels that they're a little on the inconsistent side. As for the Green Team, the experts feel that Jake and Nicole are talented individually, but have serious problems when it comes to working together. When the teams gather for the announcement, the Pink Team are, much to their surprise, named as the second team to join the finale, for showing the most improvement overall. This leaves the Green and Red Teams and in the end, the experts note that one of the teams was consistently solid throughout the season, while the other, despite arguably showing more improvement overall, tended to totally disintegrate whenever things got tough. The Green Team are therefore eliminated, though, unlike the Purple Team, are at least allowed to say goodbye to the experts and other teams and leave the show in overall high spirits, feeling that the experience was still worthwhile. The Red Team are left to join the Blue and Pink Teams in the finale. * The Dream Project: After the Green Team's elimination, the experts reveal that the three remaining teams each have a project that they (unknowingly) told the experts they wanted to do. No winner will be declared for this challenge, as the aim is to simply impress the voting public. For the Blue Team, this project is installing an electric fireplace and a feature wall for their bar, the Red Team's project is redoing their cabin's exterior walls and fitting a ceiling fan in the kitchen, and the Pink Team's is the window that they failed to install back in the second episode. All of these jobs go well, and Jesse, Danielle and Fabian each admit to underestimating the skills of their respective partners, and that they've learned to properly work as a team in the process. In fact, the teams each finish their jobs well ahead of schedule, and so make extra jobs for themselves; the Blue Team chops up the rest of the boat that they built their bar from in order to make even more decorations, the Pink Team affixes panelling to their cabin wall and the Red Team properly recesses the security light that they didn't quite finish several episodes ago. After finishing their dream projects (there is no review by the experts), each of the teams makes their case to the viewers at home as to why they deserve $50,000.  Episode 9: And the Winner Is...  : Original airdate: June 8, 2015 In this live finale episode (the length of time that has passed since the prior eight episodes is indicated by the fact that Danielle is now heavily pregnant and Luayn's formerly blonde hair is now dark brown), the three finalist teams reunite in front of a live studio audience. Voting remains open for most of the episode, and the winner will be announced at the end. The teams will still face a series of challenges in a last-gasp bid to earn the nation's votes. * Water Pipes: The first live challenge requires the three teams to each connect pipes to a laundry sink that has been placed atop a large wooden frame, and then use the tank's contents to fill a beaker to the required level, with the first team to do so winning. The Blue Team finish in last place by a large margin, after drilling their holes too small and out of alignment and not being able to regroup in time. The challenge proves a close-run race between the Pink and Red Teams, but after a slow start the Red Team are ultimately triumphant. Between challenges, highlight reels for all three teams are shown. The Red Team name their proudest moment as the range hood challenge in episode 7, where they won despite a 15-minute time penalty and Luayn injuring her hand. The Blue Team are proud of how well they regrouped after their disastrous performance in episode 3's boat lift challenge. Similarly, the Pink Team name their failure in the window challenge in episode 2 (and the ensuing spraying they took with a fire hose) as their own turning point. A \\"top 3 stumbles\\" reel is then shown, with #3 being Jake falling into the lake while placing the Green Team's boat lift, #2 being Jesse accidentally breaking his plastic chair while watching the teeter-totter challenge and #1 going to Jake again, this time for tripping up while removing the team's old toilet from the cabin, resulting in him breaking the toilet and then tripping up on a cardboard box outside the cabin. * The Pop Quiz: The three teams each take part in a quiz loosely styled after Jeopardy! answering handiwork-related questions with values of 10, 20, 30 or 40 points. The Pink Team finish third with 70 points after a poor performance in the first round, with the Blue and Red Teams tying on 130 points. The challenge goes to sudden death and the Red Team correctly answer the question to win their second consecutive challenge. After the quiz finishes, a brief reel showing the \\"top 3 jobs done without tools\\" moments is shown‚Äîall of which go to Steve, for his habit of carrying out demolition jobs by just tearing or kicking away bits of the cabin that need to be removed. * Home Challenge: Chairs The final challenge of the season is one that the contestants have to do at home with their own tools, and lumber supplied by the show. This challenge entails building a chair that can support at least 250 pounds. The Blue Team are the only ones who actually measure an existing chair, while the Pink and Red Teams make rough guesses by measuring Danielle and Luayn's approximate sitting positions. The Red and Pink Teams end up producing near-identical-looking chairs (albeit with the latter being a bit taller and narrower), while the Blue Team choose a more unorthodox plywood-based design and also produce a footrest. The experts allow the studio audience to vote for the winning chair and the Red Team's chair is overwhelmingly named the best, giving the team a clean sweep of all the episode's challenges. Before the result is announced, a few more highlight reels are shown, including of the Green and Purple Teams. The experts then give their thoughts on the three remaining teams, complimenting Luayn on the huge improvement in her skillset, Jesse and Holly on their creativity and ability to work together, Danielle for being able to set her ego aside and learn with new skils, and Tyler for gaining in confidence. Finally, the results are announced. The Blue Team finish in third place, visibly disheartening Holly and especially Jesse, though they are nonetheless complimented for the overall strong job they did. The winner of the public vote is then announced as the Red Team, who take home the $50,000 grand prize.

He was the first full-time librarian at Yale University. Early life and education He was the youngest child of Rev. Claudius Herrick, a much respected teacher in New Haven, Connecticut, and Hannah (Pierpont) Herrick. He was born in New Haven, on what is now a part of the Yale College square. After a good preliminary education, of which the College course did not form a part, he was Engaged as a clerk in the well known book-store of Gen. Hezekiah Howe, where excellent opportunities were afforded him to gratify his early thirst for knowledge. For a short time, he was in business as a bookseller on his own account. Career at Yale His official connection with the College commenced in 1843. As the Yale University Library was about to be removed to a new edifice, he was appointed Librarian, and he continued to discharge the duties of that office fifteen years, till his resignation in 1858. In 1852 he was also appointed Treasurer of Yale College, and he held that post until his death. His services to the College, however, were by no means confined to his official trusts; but he labored for its interests in every way which his versatile industry could suggest. Since the death of Professor James Luce Kingsley, he edited the Yale Triennial Catalogue, and prepared the annual record of the deceased graduates of the College. He also made extensive researches respecting the history of the College, and collected much information respecting the biographies of the early graduates. His public spirit led him to perform many important labors for the town of New Haven, among which, his care for the public records, and his supervision of the Cemetery, are most note-worthy Notwithstanding his life of incessant business, he made high attainments in various departments of science. Entomology was one of his favorite studies, and although he published comparatively little, his acquaintance with the literature of the subject was extensive, and his original investigations were valuable. He was enthusiastically devoted to Astronomy and Meteorology. From an early period in his life, he was an observer of the heavens, and an accurate recorder of his observations. He rendered important services in determining the periodicity of meteoric showers, and discovered by his own researches the return of the August Perseids. He took great pains to collect information respecting the paths of remarkable meteors of which he heard, and to look up historical notices of those of earlier years. He likewise paid special attention to the recurrence of the Aurora Borealis, keeping for several years an accurate daily register of the appearance or non-appearance of that phenomenon. Numerous articles from his pen, on all these topics, are to be found in the American Journal of Science. He received, but did not accept, an appointment as a member of the United States Exploring Expedition, under Capt Charles Wilkes. In the local history of the college, the town and the state, in American biography, in general literature, especially in quaint and entertaining lore, in English etymology, and in bibliography, his attainments were great, and his knowledge was always at command. He was constantly referred to as an adviser and a critic, not only by his neighbors and College associates, but by those at a distance who knew his reputation. It is believed that the time and pains which he expended in these indirect contributions to literature and science, would, if otherwise employed, have given him wide distinction in the world of letters. Death After a brief illness, he died. He was never married, but kept house in New Haven for his mother, to whom he was affectionately devoted, until her death in 1859. He died at his residence in New Haven, June 11, 1862, aged 51 years. Notes *1861-1862 deaths References  External links  * Sketch of the life of Edward C.

The event's main goal is to act as a non-partisan meeting ground for European and Iranian businesses to discuss future cooperation post sanctions. Following the historic Joint Action Plan agreement reached by Iran and the Group P5+1 in November 2013, a series of economic sanctions were lifted, rekindling commercial interest in Iran throughout Europe. The event, a first of its kind to offer Iran as a potential investment destination garnered attention in the press including the BBC. The Europe-Iran forum is the first event created by the private sector to have the moral support from the government of President Hassan Rouhani Scheduled speakers included Martin Sorrell, chief executive of advertising group WPP, as well as Jack Straw and Hubert Vedrine, former British and French foreign ministers respectively. The Forum also has the blessing of Rouhani, whose chief of staff has written a letter of support to the organizers, media company European Voice. The first post-sanctions conference was held in Vienna, Austria and second event has been slated for fall 2015 in the Swiss city of Geneva. The event's stated goal is to provide a platform for both Iranian and international banking and finance groups to discuss future cooperation post-sanctions. The second forum was dubbed the Europe-Iran Forum, considering it was being held in the Swiss city of Geneva, and not in a European Union country.

This committee failed in its task and a second committee was appointed on June 9, 1859. The committee recommended in April 1860 the purchase of land claimed by John Flagg, but this recommendation was not accepted by the city council. A third cemetery committee was appointed and it reported on April 18, 1860 that an agreement had not been reached by the members.Sunset Cemetery (1936), p. 3. A fourth cemetery committee was appointed on June 16, 1860. The land chosen by the fourth committee was claimed by Clark M. Lewis, but he could not provide clear title. In August 1860, Lewis transferred the recommended land to John Pipher with the condition that he should give a warranty deed for the land to the city.

The city offered a contest prize of $10 to anyone who could offer a suitable layout for the land on the west side of the ravine. No records exist noting the payment of the prize In 1901, Benjamin F. Miller deeded an additional to the city in his will. This land was north of the northeast corner and designated for cemetery purposes only. In 1929, Manhattan residents approved a bond vote for $12,000 to purchase from Delmar Wickham. The first grave is not officially recorded, but tradition claims that it was Juliet Whitehorn, who died of typhoid fever in November 1860.Earlier records of deaths are in the sexton's office, such as Charles S. Denison (d. April 6, 1855), but it is assumed that these individuals were re-interred from elsewhere. See, Sunset Cemetery (1979), p. i. The first superintendent was Charles Barnes, who was appointed July 6, 1863 and salaried at $25 per year.Sunset Cemetery, p. 5 Most of Manhattan's early settlers, business owners, and politicians are buried in Sunset Cemetery. A large number of the early faculty members of Kansas State Agricultural College (now Kansas State University) are interred there as well. A small portion of cemetery land lies outside of the walls to the east. This land contains the sexton's home and office, as well as Denison Circle, a granite boulder monument recognizing the contributions of the first KSAC President Joseph J. Denison and Manhattan's earliest settlers. Presently, interments are continuing, but all lots have been sold.

The QCC is housed at the Information Sciences Institute (ISI), a computer science and engineering research unit of the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, and is jointly operated by ISI and Lockheed Martin. USC faculty, ISI researchers and students are performing basic and applied research into quantum computing, and are collaborating with researchers around the world. The QCC uses a D-Wave Two quantum annealing system, manufactured by D-Wave Systems, Inc. The QCC is the first organization outside of D-Wave to operate the system. The second system is installed at NASA Ames Research Center, and is operated jointly by NASA and Google. The systems must be kept extremely cold and electromagnetically well-shielded to operate with the longest possible coherence time. Purpose Quantum information processing, also called quantum computing, theoretically is known to offer dramatic speed-ups and more complete answers for some combinatorial computing problems. Quantum annealing is a branch of quantum computing whose advantages over classical computing are actively being investigated. In quantum annealing, problems are encoded into the lowest energy state of a physical quantum system. Applications currently under study at the QCC include big data analysis, verification and validation of cyber-physical systems, pattern identification and classification, and optimization and machine learning, any of which may support breakthroughs in multiple industries and government. USC and ISI researchers, as well as Lockheed Martin engineers, seek to develop methods to benchmark quantum annealers, and perform tests of quantumness. These include the study of quantum entanglement and, more generally, the performance of quantum annealing experiments. Researchers also are working to manage quantum decoherence, the phenomenon that degrades the performance of quantum information processors when quantum states are forced out of quantum superposition. Decoherence can reduce quantum functionality to that of a classical computer, and can be counteracted using quantum error correction.\\"Quantum Error Correction\\", by D.A. Lidar and T.A. Brun (editors), Cambridge University Press (2013). QCC researchers and their collaborators have developed methods to counteract decoherence in quantum annealers by combining quantum error correction with energy penalties that suppress decoherence into a single quantum annealing correction method. History The QCC was launched in November, 2011 under the leadership of Scientific and Technical Director Daniel Lidar, a USC professor of electrical engineering, chemistry and physics; Operational Director Robert F. Lucas, director of ISI‚Äôs Computational Systems and Technology division; and Ned Allen and Greg Tallant of Lockheed Martin. The QCC began with a 128-qubit D-Wave One, which was replaced in March 2013 with the 512-qubit D-Wave Two. Research Research initially focused on testing whether the D-Wave is in fact a quantum system,http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/24/quantum-computing-research- may-back-controversial-company/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=2 and has expanded to benchmarking the D-Wave against classical algorithms, and various applications, including quantum machine learning. Lockheed Martin researchers have focused on the application of adiabatic quantum computing to the problem of verification and validation of control systems and other tasks with similar mathematical structure, such as the design of special wave forms for RF applications with minimal side-lobes. People The team includes more than a dozen USC faculty members, ISI researchers, postdoctoral and graduate students, and more than 100 Lockheed Martin users.

It was proclaimed on 13 April 2015 by Czech libertarian politician and activist V√≠t Jedliƒçka. The official website of Liberland states that the nation was created due to the ongoing Croatia‚ÄìSerbia border dispute, in which some areas to the east of the Danube are claimed by both Serbia and Croatia, while some areas to the west, including the area of Liberland, are considered part of Serbia by Croatia, but Serbia does not claim them. The size of the land in question is , or roughly the same as Gibraltar. It has been administered by Croatia since the Croatian War of Independence. There has been no diplomatic recognition of Liberland, although it has established relations with Somaliland (also unrecognized). The land lacks infrastructure and lies on a floodplain.  Location  The dispute regarding the border along the Danube River valley first arose in 1947 but was left unresolved during the existence of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It became a contentious issue after the break-up of Yugoslavia. Serbia holds the opinion that the thalweg of the Danube valley and the centre line of the river represents the international border between the two countries. Croatia disagrees and claims that the international border lies along the boundaries of the cadastral municipalities located along the river‚Äîdeparting from the course at several points‚Äîreflecting the course of the Danube which existed in the 19th century before meandering and hydraulic engineering works altered its course. As a result, Croatia claims a large part of the disputed area controlled by Serbia, while Serbia does not claim the much smaller parts controlled by Croatia. Jedliƒçka says that the land he has claimed, known as Gornja Siga (meaning upper tufa), was not claimed by either side. The area is about , about the same size of Gibraltar, and most of it is covered with forests. There are no residents. A journalist from the Czech newspaper Parlamentn√≠ listy who visited the area in April 2015 found a house that had been abandoned for about thirty years, according to people living in the vicinity. The access road was reported to be in a bad condition. The Danube, an international waterway with free access to the Black Sea for several landlocked nations, runs along the self-proclaimed territory.  History   Proclamation  The territory claimed by Liberland is the largest green-coloured land parcel, marked as \\"Siga\\" on the map. Due to differences in the border definitions, the yellow-coloured parts to the east are claimed by both Serbia and Croatia. Croatia asserts that the green parts are part of Serbia, but Serbia does not claim them. This led Jedliƒçka to assert that the green parts have remained unclaimed by both sides. The flag raising in Gornja Siga was performed by V√≠t Jedliƒçka and some of his associates on the same day the republic was proclaimed. Jedliƒçka is a member of the Czech Party of Free Citizens, which bases its values on the classical liberal ideology. Jedliƒçka stated that no nation claims the land as its own and he therefore could claim it using the terra nullius doctrine. The border, he argued, was defined in accordance with Croatian and Serbian border claims and did not interfere with any other state's sovereignty. Jedliƒçka said in April 2015 that an official diplomatic note would be sent to both Croatia and Serbia, and later to all other states, with a formal request for international recognition. On 20 April 2015, Jedliƒçka delivered a lecture at the Prague School of Economics, titled \\"Liberland ‚Äì how a state is born\\" (). He discussed various aspects of the project and the interest it has attracted around the world. One topic that he brought up was the Montevideo Convention; he explained that Liberland intended to satisfy the principles of the convention, which is commonly used to define a state. At the time of the lecture, the Liberland project had assigned ten people willing to handle foreign relations. Other topics covered in the lecture included the concept of voluntary taxation and how the large number of citizenship applications had made it necessary to restructure the citizenship process to be more effective, since it was only based on an e-mail account. On 18 December 2015, Jedliƒçka held an event at which he presented the first provisional government of Liberland and its ministers of finance, foreign affairs, interior and justice as well as two vice presidents.  Flag  The flag consists of a yellow backdrop (symbolizing libertarianism) with a black stripe running horizontally through the centre (symbolizing less government, anarchy/rebellion) and the coat of arms in the centre. Within the coat of arms, the bird represents freedom, the tree represents prosperity, the blue river represents the Danube River, and the sun represents happiness.  Access  Croatian authorities have frequently blocked access to the area since the beginning of May 2015. In May 2015, V√≠t Jedliƒçka and his translator Sven Sambunjak were briefly detained by Croatian police after making an attempt to cross the border. Jedliƒçka spent one night in detention and then was convicted and ordered to pay a fine for illegal crossing of the Croatian border but appealed the verdict. He claimed that there were at least three Liberland citizens inside the area, who came from Switzerland. Later that month, V√≠t Jedliƒçka was detained again. Initially, reporters were able to enter the area with Jedliƒçka but subsequently they were also denied entry, including journalists from the Serbian public broadcast service Radio Television of Vojvodina, and from the Bosnian newspaper Dnevni avaz. The detained were from various countries, including Ireland, Germany, Denmark, and the United States. Croatian police have continued detaining people, including those that entered the area by boat (via an international waterway). One of them, Danish activist Ulrik Gr√∏ssel Haagensen, was placed in house arrest for 5 days before being sentenced to 15 days of prison, triggering some protests in Denmark. In May 2016, several appeals court decisions from Croatia were published. The court upheld that crossing into Liberland from Croatia is illegal, but found the convictions for entering Liberland from Serbia improper. The court said that the lower court committed \\"a fundamental breach of misdemeanour proceedings\\" and \\"essential procedural violations\\". It further ruled that \\"the facts were incorrectly and incompletely established [by the prosecutor] which could lead to misapplication of substantive law\\". A retrial was ordered in 6 of the 7 appeals. The lower court is required to determine the location of the border and the border crossing.  Public reactions  Journalists have been uncertain as to how serious Jedliƒçka is about his claims, with some calling it a publicity stunt. In an interview with Parlamentn√≠ Listy in April 2015, Jedliƒçka claimed that he had received positive reactions for his initiative, mainly from his own party, the Party of Free Citizens, for which he was a regional chairman, but also from some members of the Civic Democratic Party and the Pirate Party. On 20 May 2015, Petr Mach, the leader of the Party of Free Citizens, expressed support for the creation of a state based on ideas of freedom, adding that the Party of Free Citizens wants the Czech Republic to become a similarly free country. Dominik Stroukal from the Czech-Slovak branch of the Ludwig von Mises Institute wrote: \\"The escapade succeeded for V√≠t. The whole world reports about Liberland with words like 'tax competition', 'libertarianism', etc.\\" Goran Vojkoviƒá, professor of law and columnist from the Croatian news portal Index.hr, described Liberland as a \\"circus which threatens Croatian territory\\", and argued that there was a risk that Croatia's claim to control land on the other side of the Danube may be weakened by the attention that the Liberland project has drawn to the border dispute. In 2016, an article in Stratfor summarized the initiative as follows: \\"Liberland is a curious case because, in principle, none of the actors that could claim control over it seems interested in doing so. But this will probably remain a curiosity with negligible consequences at the international level. For the rest of the world's disputed territories, violence and diplomacy will remain the main tools to claim ownership.\\"  Legal analysis  Legal experts in both Serbia and Croatia have said that, under international law, Jedliƒçka lacks the right to claim the area, which is currently the subject of a dispute between the two nations. Croatia and Serbia have dismissed Jedliƒçka's claims as frivolous, although the two countries have reacted in different ways. On 24 April 2015, the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that while they consider the affair a trivial matter, the \\"new state\\" does not impinge upon the Serbian border, which is delineated by the Danube. Croatia, which currently administers the land in question, has stated that after international arbitration, it should be awarded to Croatia or Serbia, not to a third party. An article in the Chicago Journal of International Law, the law review of the University of Chicago Law School, examined Liberland's claim to statehood in light of the criteria laid out by the Montevideo Convention. According to the author, \\"Croatia‚Äôs insistence that Liberland is part of Serbia could constitute a renunciation of Croatia‚Äôs legal rights to Liberland. Conversely, if the territory that Liberland claims as its own is Serbian, the Serbian government‚Äôs renunciation of its title to that land could also be a quitclaim that would transform the legal status of the land to terra nullius. In both instances, the territory would belong to the first entity ‚Äîin this case Liberland‚Äî to claim it. However, because of the complicated history of the Croatian-Serbian border region, it may be difficult to ascertain who the land belongs to under international law.\\"Rossman, Gabriel (2016) \\"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (But Still So Far): Assessing Liberland‚Äôs Claim of Statehood,\\" Chicago Journal of International Law: Vol. 17: No. 1, Article 10. URL: http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cjil/vol17/iss1/10 An article in the Michigan Journal of International Law argues that the United Nations should recognize Liberland.  Plan of administration  A government with ten to twenty members has been suggested for the administration of Liberland, to be elected by electronic voting. Liberland intends to operate on an open-border policy. The goal of the micronation, as claimed by its website, is to create \\"a society where righteous people can prosper with minimal state regulations and taxes\\". The founders are inspired by countries like Monaco and Liechtenstein. Liberland has published a draft version of a codified constitution and a list of laws to be included in the constitution. These documents describe Liberland as a country governed under a three-power system with executive, legislative and judicial sectors that seek to promote individual rights, including property rights, freedom of speech and the right to keep and bear arms. It has also a list of criminal offences, which include \\"polluting environment\\", \\"public nuisance\\" in addition to crimes such as murder, manslaughter and theft. There are plans for an official cryptocurrency called Merit, although all other currencies would be allowed. There will be a maximum of 700 million merits. In an attempt to gain recognition at the UN, Liberland appointed 70 representatives in over 60 countries within a year of proclamation. As of February 2018, Liberland had recruited over 100 representatives in over 80 countries.  Citizenship  Liberland Citizenship Certificate According to its official web page, Liberland is currently looking for people who have respect for other people and their opinions, regardless of their race, ethnicity, orientation, or religion, have respect for private ownership which is untouchable, and have not been punished for past criminal offences. Liberland received 200,000 applications in a week. In the beginning of May 2015, Liberland accepted around thirty citizens. An event was supposed to take place in the claimed territory, but Croatian border police stopped the group from entering it from the Croatian side. An attempt to cross the river with fishing boats from Serbia failed because the local fishermen didn't have permits for transporting people with their boats. Serbian police informed Jedliƒçka that anyone trying to cross the border illegally would be arrested. An improvised ceremony was instead held in Baƒçki Mono≈°tor. On 16 February 2018, United States politician and former candidate for U.S. Presidency Ron Paul was officially presented with a Liberland passport and citizenship certificate by Jedliƒçka and his cabinet. Jedliƒçka initially offered \\"Liberland citizenship\\" for 10,000 merits, equivalent 1:1 to USD, but later reduced it to 5,000. There will be a cap of 140,000 citizenships.  Recognition  There has been no diplomatic recognition of Liberland by any member of the United Nations. However, Liberland has established relations with Somaliland, a self- declared state that proclaimed its independence from Somalia in 1991. Liberland and Somaliland signed a Memorandum of Understanding in September 2017 vowing to establish closer relations and cooperate in the areas of technology, energy and banking.  Official statements from sovereign states  *: Liberland has been mentioned by the Croatian Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs but publicly rejected as a joke. On 29 June 2015, the Croatian Ministry of Foreign affairs said that Gornja Siga's status is undetermined, but it is not terra nullius, and after international arbitration, it will be awarded to Croatia or Serbia, not to a third party. However, in a May 2016 letter to the Croatian Interior Minister Vlaho Orepiƒá, Croatian Minister of Foreign and European Affairs Miro Kovaƒç referred to Liberland as \\"a provocative idea which has reached serious proportions\\" which \\"represents a risk to the Republic of Croatia.\\" The letter called for finding a solution to \\"remove promotion and attempts of realization of idea of Liberland\\", recommending that \\"Ministry of the Interior, Security and Intelligence Agency (SIA), Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs coordinate necessary measures and their actions, so that this provocative idea could be stopped.\\"REPUBLIC OF CROATIA MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AND EUROPEAN AFFAIRS, MINISTER Dr. Miro Kovaƒç CLASS: 212-03/15-01/1, NO: 521 ‚Äì V- 02/16-9, Zagreb, May 12th 2016 On 17 January 2017, Liberland was discussed and debated in the Croatian Parliament (Sabor) by politician Ivan Pernar of the ≈Ωivi Zid party, who claimed that Croatia should consider the recognition. *: The Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated that Liberland does not infringe upon the border of Serbia, but the project is seen as \\"frivolous\\". *: The Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has warned people of the possibility of scams about Liberland directed at people looking for jobs abroad. \\"Egyptians should seek information from the Foreign Ministry rather than social media before travelling for work.\\" *: The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs disassociated itself from the activities of Mr. Jedliƒçka, stating it has nothing to do with them. The ministry added that \\"Mr. Jedliƒçka, as well as other Czech citizens staying in the territory of Croatia or Serbia, is obliged to abide by the local legal code. The Czech Republic considers the activities of Mr. Jedliƒçka inappropriate and potentially harmful.\\" Through the Embassy of the Czech Republic in Zagreb, it warned that the \\"efforts to create some new 'state' have no basis in international law,\\" and that \\"in the territory of Croatia, citizens of the Czech Republic as well as other foreigners are obliged to adhere to the Croatian legal code, including the current regime on the Croatian-Serbian border. Crossing the Croatian border (i.e., the external border of the European Union) outside specified border crossings, as it is done by travellers to the so-called Liberland, is in clear violation of the code.\\" *: On 24 July 2016, 7 members of Polish Parliament (Sejm) from Kukiz'15, in cooperation with local Liberland activists, asked Minister of Foreign Affairs Witold Waszczykowski when Poland would recognize the Free Republic of Liberland as an independent state, with a follow-up in August. The reply was that Liberland does not meet the criteria for statehood.  Statements from unrecognized states  * , a self-declared state internationally recognized as an autonomous region of Somalia, has begun the mutual recognition process with Liberland and commenced cooperation on a number of important fronts.

He founded what became the New Haven Law School, which was absorbed by Yale University as their Yale Law School. He was the brother-in-law of Roger Sherman, Jr. He was son of Rev. John and Susanna (Perkins) Staples, and was born in Canterbury, Connecticut. He graduated from Yale College in 1797. After studying law for two years in the office of Judge Daggett, in New Haven, Connecticut, he was admitted to the bar in Litchfield, Connecticut, in Sept. 1799. He began to practice his profession in New Haven. His legal attainments and his excellent library early drew around him a large number of students, and he soon found himself at the head of a flourishing private Law School. After toiling alone for several years, in 1820 he called to his aid Judge Samuel J. Hitchcock, and made him a partner both in his business and in his Law School. In 1846 the School thus originated, having meanwhile passed into other hands, was formally recognized by the Corporation of Yale College, as the Law Department of that Institution. During his residence in New Haven, he was several times a Representative of the town, in the Legislature of Connecticut, but he withdrew wholly from public life in 1816. In 1824 he removed from New Haven to New York City, where he was wholly devoted to his profession till about 1856. His ability, industry and attainments made him a distinguished ornament of the bar. He was married in Nov., 1799, to Catharine, only daughter of Rev S. Wales, Prof, of Divinity in Yale College. He had three sons and three daughters. He died in New York City, Nov. 6, 1861, aged 85.

The book tells of Sir Geraint and his wife Enid, Sir Galahad and how he achieved the Holy Grail, and the death of King Arthur. It is the last of Pyle's Arthurian series. Plot The Story of Sir Geraint In the story, Sir Geraint, along with Queen Guinevere and her court, woke up late on a day in which King Arthur is supposed to go hunting. They go to catch up with the King, who already left them behind. Along the way, a damsel meets a knight and wishes to know his name. She asks his companion, however, he refuses to answer. Geraint takes up a quarrel with this man and demands to know the knight's name. He follows them to where they are travelling. He learns that the knight is a celebrated champion of a prize called the Sparrow-Hawk, and that he is participating in a tournament tomorrow for it. Geraint decides to join the tournament, but he has no armor or weapons. He visits an old, run-down castle nearby. The owner of the castle is happy to help Geraint, and gives him the greatest armor he has. The armor, however, is very old-fashioned and rusty. Geraint kindly accepts nevertheless. Here he also meets Enid, the owner of the castle's beautiful daughter, though she is half his age. Geraint is mocked at the tournament for his primitive armor, but he wins the tournament because of his great prowess. The knight claims his name is Gaudeamus in order for his life to be spared. Later, he walks in the garden with Enid. He asks her to be his bride, and she says yes. They are married happily, and Enid is gladly accepted into court. However, Geraint begins to feel jealous of Enid playing with a handsome young knight named Sir Peregrans. He feels that he has been a bad husband, and somewhat regrets marrying her because she can't marry the man who he believes she is suited for. Sir Geraint keeps his feelings to himself, and begins to treat Enid coldly. Geraint suddenly claims one evening that he wishes to return to his father's castle, and they go. They spend their times merrily, but Geraint neglects his knightly duties. People gossip on how Geraint is inseparable from his wife, and that his wife has weakened him. Enid woke up very early one morning, and reflected the gossip she has heard. She feels sorry for how her husband was not as strong as he was, and puts the blame on herself. She whispers to herself, \\"Is it then true what they say‚Äîthat my white and tender limbs may hold my husband away from those great adventures to which he belongs ? Is it true that the love of a woman can sap a man of all purpose and ambition in his life of activity?\\" Geraint awakes, but does not open his eyes. He hears Enid whisper softly, \\"I am at fault and am no true, right wife for this noble hero.\\" Geraint instantly feels betrayed; he thinks that his wife meant that she was unfaithful. Geraint quickly decides to go and search for adventure, and he takes his wife. He tells her not to say a word. However, Enid comes across many thieves in the woods who she overhears are planning to steal from Geraint. She disobeys him and tells him. Geraint overthrows all of the thieves. Enid and Geraint come to an inn, and he asks for a feast with the innkeeper's friends. An Earl who attends the feast gazes at Enid, and finds her very beautiful. He gives Enid two options: she may willingly become his mistress and have Geraint go off safely, or she may unwillingly become his mistress and have Geraint die. Enid tells the Earl to pretend to carry her off unwillingly. However, the next morning she makes a quick escape with Geraint to avoid the Earl. The innkeeper, unaware of Enid's trouble, tells the Earl where Geraint and Enid are going. The Earl and his men catches up with them. Geraint overthrows them all. Geraint is thought to be mad because of his continuous adventures which tire Enid. Geraint ends up being wounded by two giants. Another Earl, the Earl of Limours, takes him to his castle. Geraint is thought to be dead, or close to death. The Earl of Limours quickly tells Enid that she is beautiful, and says \\"When thy lord is dead, then will I marry thee and will bestow upon thee myself and this castle and all these lands through which we passed to day, and all other things thou shalt have that are mine.\\" Enid cries while thinking of her life without Geraint. The Earl offers her to sit with him and eat, but she refuses unless her husband is with them. Geraint lies in a bier near the table. Enid still refuses to eat or drink because her husband isn't with her. The Earl, very frustrated, punches Enid. Geraint heard all that happened, and he heard how faithful Enid was to him. He becomes very angry and grabs the sword laying near him. He quickly jumps out of the bier, as if he was rising from the dead. He kills the Earl of Limours, and he rides away with his wife. Their friend meets them, and lets him come to his castle.

The race, between crews representing Oxford University Women's Boat Club and Cambridge University Women's Boat Club, was umpired by Judith Packer. Cambridge's crew, the heavier of the two, was entirely British, while Oxford's boat included rowers from Canada, Switzerland and the United States. Oxford won by four lengths in a time of 5 minutes 50 seconds, their second consecutive win. The victory took the overall record in the event to 41-28 in Cambridge's favour. It was the last time the race would be conducted over a straight race as part of the Henley Boat Races. Background The Women's Boat Race is a side-by- side rowing competition between eights from Oxford University Women's Boat Club and the Cambridge University Women's Boat Club that has taken place since 1927. Oxford went into the race as champions, having won the previous year's race by one and three-quarter lengths; Cambridge led 41-27 overall. It was the last time the race would be conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races, along a stretch of the River Thames referred to as the Straight Course which is used for the Henley Royal Regatta since 1924. The 2015 race would be conducted on The Championship Course on the same day as men's race. Cambridge's number five, Catherine Foot, remarked \\"After training, I step back and think 'wow, I'm part of this incredible tradition'. There is nothing else I'd rather be doing than training for this event\\", while Oxford's stroke Amber de Vere said \\"All the training has been leading up to this weekend. Next year is definitely exciting and it has added something to training, but as a crew, we're only thinking about Sunday.\\" This year's race was umpired by Judith Packer and was sponsored by Newton Investment Management, a subsidiary of The Bank of New York Mellon, for the third successive year. Crews Cambridge's bow Caroline Reid (left) and Oxford number seven Anastasia Chitty (pictured in 2015) During the build-up to the race, the two universities sent trial boats to race on 19 December 2013. For the first time in the history of the competition, this took place on the Tideway on part of the Championship Course. The two Cambridge boats were named Nudge Nudge and Wink Wink (with a third reserve boat called Say No More), while Oxford's trialists rowed in Cleopatra and Boudicca. Both trials were overseen by Olympic bronze medallist Sarah Winckless. The Cambridge crew weighed an average of per rower, more than their opponents. Three members of Oxford's 2013 crew returned to race in 2014: Alice Carrington-Windo, Maxie Scheske and Anastasia Chitty. Cambridge's boat included two double Blues in Caroline Reid and Holly Game, while four other members of the crew had taken part in the previous year's race. Every member of the Cambridge crew was British, while Oxford's boat included Canadian Elizabeth Fence, German/Britons Carrington-Windo and Scheske, Nadine Graedel Iberg from Switzerland and American Laura Savarese (who had rowed in the Harvard‚ÄìYale Regatta for Harvard University on four occasions). { class= - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Seat ! colspan=\\"4\\"  Cambridge 30px ! colspan=\\"4\\"  Oxford 30px -  Name  College  Nationality  Weight  Name  College  Nationality  Weight -  Bow Caroline Reid  Jesus  British   Elizabeth Fenje  Kellogg  Canadian  -  2  Kate Ashley  Peterhouse  British   Alice Carrington-Windo  Kellogg  German/British  -  3  Holly Game  Girton  British   Maxie Scheske (P)  Magdalen  German/British  -  4  Isabella Vyvyan  Hughes Hall  British   Lauren Kedar  Exeter  British  -  5  Catherine Foot  Girton  British   Nadine Graedel Iberg  Lincoln  Swiss  -  6  Melissa Wilson  Gonville and Caius  British   Laura Savarese  Corpus Christi  American  -  7  Claire Watkins  Clare  British   Anastasia Chitty Pembroke  British  -  Stroke  Emily Day  Emmanuel  British   Amber de Vere  Somerville  British  -  Cox  Esther Momcilovic (P)  Clare  British   Erin Wysocki-Jones  Pembroke  British  - !colspan=\\"9\\"Sources: (P) - boat club president } Race A newly-designed trophy (pictured in 2015) was presented by Olympic gold medallist Sophie Hosking. Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Berkshire side, handing the Buckinghamshire station to Oxford. At 3p.m., umpire Palmer dropped the flag to start the race. Both crews went off rating 40 strokes per minute and after the first Oxford were half a length ahead. By the time the crews passed the Upper Thames Rowing Club, Oxford's lead was over a length. Cambridge made a series of pushes; both crews were warned by the umpire to avoid a collision. Oxford continued to extend their lead to win by four lengths, the largest winning margin since the 2010 race. Their time was 5 minutes 50 seconds, six seconds slower than the record time set by Oxford in the 2006 race. The victory was Oxford's second consecutive win and their sixth in the last seven; it took the overall record in the event to 41-28 in Cambridge's favour. The former Oxford cox Rachel Quarrell, writing in The Daily Telegraph stated that the race \\"was won in storming style\\" and suggested the contest was over within the first two minutes. A newly-designed trophy, to replace the existing wooden shield, was awarded to the Oxford president by Olympic gold medallist Sophie Hosking who had won the Women's lightweight double sculls at the 2012 Summer Olympics.

The station was listed as a Michigan State Historic Site in 1978, and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.  History  View of Station in 1910 The first rail line through Lansing was established in 1856 when the Detroit and Milwaukee Railroad constructed a line through the city. This was followed in 1872 by the Michigan Central Railroad and in 1879 by the Chicago and Grand Trunk Railway. By the early 1900s there were six separate rail lines through the city. After the Chicago and Grand Trunk Railway reorganized in 1900, they built a series of new depots along their line. When REO Motor Car Company announced the construction of a new plant along the Grand Trunk line, the railroad decided to construct their new depot near the new REO plant. Grand Trunk commissioned the firm of Spier & Rohns tp design the new depot. Construction on the new depot began in 1902 and was completed late that year. It served as a main depot for all passengers until 1971, when the railroad closed the station. In 1972, it was renovated as a restaurant. The building's exterior remains unchanged. Gerald R. Ford, who was from Michigan and the 38th president of the United States, dined here during a campaign tour on May 15, 1976. The building was abandoned in the early 2000s. In 2010, the Lansing Board of Water & Light began construction of a powerplant adjacent to the depot, and included a full restoration of the station in the project. Description The Lansing Grand Trunk Western station is a single story, rectangular Jacobethan style red-brick building on a gray ashlar foundation. It measures 33 feet wide and 107 feet long. The main entrance is housed in a two-story, ten-foot square brick tower which is topped by a crenelated parapet. The roof is covered with red tile, and has overhanging eaves. The window hoods, sills, facings, and gable copings are of Bedford limestone. At one end of the building is a waiting platform, covered with a gable roof supported by wooden posts.

Derbyshire. Nikolaus Pevsner. Yale University Press. 1978. History The first church on the site was built by a speculator from Sheffield in 1831 and dedicated to St. George as a chapel of ease to St Peter's Church, Derby. It closed in 1835. In March 1836 it was purchased from the speculator and repaired. It opened for worship on 23 April 1831. A new parish was formed out of the parish of St Peter on 23 October 1836. It was rededicated to the Holy Trinity and consecrated on 16 August 1837. By 1870 the tower was leaning away from the building, and emergency repairs were undertaken to secure it to the fabric of the building with iron ties. However, the church deteriorated further, and an architects report in 1897 outlined the dangerous condition of the building. The top of the tower was removed in 1902, and the last service in the old building was held on Easter Day, 1903. On 15 July 1903 a foundation stone was laid by C.E. Newton JP DL for a new building. The architect was Charles Hewitt of Brighton, and the contractor was Walker and Slater of Derby. The new church was consecrated on 18 May 1905 by the Bishop of Southwell, Edwin Hoskyns. It closed as a Church of England parish in 1972 and the parish was merged with Christ Church, Derby. The church building was sold to the Assemblies of the First Born. Organ The church contained an organ by Bates dating from the 1850s. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

He enrolled at the Leeds School of Art, the Royal College of Art, and became a teacher in the Richmond School of Art. The creative work of his long and successful career‚Äîsingly and in various art groups‚Äîincluded landscape and portrait painting, abstract works, creating church murals and serving as a war artist during World War II. In particular he was known for the bold style of his figure and portrait work. After World War Two his paintings became more abstract. Life and work Coxon was born in Hanley, Staffordshire, the second of seven children to James and Georgina Coxon. When he completed his schooling, at the local Leek High School, Coxon joined the British Army. He applied to join the Artists Rifles but was rejected and joined the cavalry section of the Machine Gun Corps with whom he served, and fought, in Egypt and Palestine throughout World War I. While abroad he painted miniatures in watercolours which he sent home to his family. Convoy (1942) (Art.IWM ART LD 2161) After he was discharged from the Army, Coxon enrolled at the Leeds School of Art, now the Leeds College of Art. While he was there, between 1919 and 1921, he not only met his future wife but also became friends with a fellow student, Henry Moore. In 1922 Moore and Coxon visited France and met a number of artists there, including Pierre Bonnard and Aristide Maillol. Coxon continued his studies in London at the Royal College of Art between 1921 and 1925 under Sir William Rothenstein. For his RCA Diploma submission, Coxon produced a mural based on Masaccio's Expulsion from the Garden of Eden. Coxon took a teaching post at the Richmond School of Art in 1925 and in 1926 he married Edna Ginesi, with Moore acting as his best-man. Coxon would later perform the same service for Moore when he married Irina Radetsky in July 1929. In 1927 the Coxons, Moore, Leon Underwood and others formed a short- lived artists grouping called the British Independent Society. The following year Coxon had his first one-man show at the Cooling Galleries. He became a member of the London Group in 1931 and of the Chiswick Group in 1938. Early in World War II, Coxon offered his services to the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC, and in particular volunteered to return to Palestine as a war artist. That offer was refused but WAAC commissioned Coxon to produce some paintings of Army subjects in Britain, after which they purchased several other pieces from him. Independently of WAAC, Coxon received commissions from the Royal Navy and Army that saw him spend time on a corvette on convoy duty, join a river patrol on the Thames and witness parachutists making training jumps. He also produced some fine portraits during the war, notably of the Victoria Cross recipient Pip Gardner and also a portrait of his own wife in her ambulance service uniform. After the war, Coxon, and Ginesi, continued to paint and travel. His paintings became more abstract and less representational but the main theme of his work remained, as it had been in the 1930s, the depiction of nature and of landscapes. Coxon and Ginesi held a joint show at the Parkin Gallery in 1985 and he was the subject of a retrospective exhibition at the Potteries Museum & Art Gallery in 1987 and a memorial exhibition at the Walton Gallery in 2001.

The white-cheeked macaque lives in forest habitats, from tropical forests to primary and secondary evergreen broad-leaved forests and mixed broadleaf-conifer forests. The species was first described by its discoverers, Chinese primatologists Cheng Li, Chao Zhao, and Peng-Fei Fan, in the American Journal of Primatology in 2015. It is one of twenty-three extant species in the genus Macaca, and the most recent to be formally described to science. While the species' exact conservation status has not yet been determined, it is likely threatened by poaching, deforestation, and increased human development of its habitat, much like the other primates which inhabit the area. Discovery From Walong, Arunachal Pradesh, India. The white- cheeked macaque was discovered and described in 2015, making it one of the most recently discovered mammals and one of the most recently discovered primates. While specimens of the creature had been observed and known for many years prior, they were believed to be members of the species Macaca assamensis, the Assam macaque. After footage captured on a series camera traps in Tibet revealed numerous physical differences between the Assam macaque and the animals caught on tape (including more prominent whiskers, thicker neck hair, and differences in the shape of the genitalia), primatologists in China declared them to be a new species. Their research, along with a series of photographs of the species, was published in the July 2015 issue of the American Journal of Primatology. In April 2016, a group of wildlife photographers and biologists spotted and photographed the white-cheeked macaque in Arunachal Pradesh, India. Prior to this sighting, the species was thought to exist only in Tibet. Appearance Physiologically, the white- cheeked macaque is similar to the other members of the genus Macaca. In terms of outward appearance, it closely resembles the Assam macaque, which is one of the reasons the two were believed to be the same species until recently. The main differences between the two include the presence of white, elongated whiskers on the face of the white-cheeked macaque, which are absent from other species. The whiskers begin to grow as the creatures approach sexual maturity, and eventually cover the whole face, giving the animals a rounded facial appearance. The white-cheeked macaque also grows dense hair along its neck, while not growing any hair along its short tail. Additionally, there is a distinct difference in the shapes of the genitalia of the two species; contrary to the arrow-shaped structure present in the Assam macaque, the white-cheeked macaque displays a more rounded structure. This was one of the main characteristics that allowed scientists to realize they were dealing with a new species.

Another train, that had right of way, had passed through the junction 44 seconds earlier and no collision occurred nor was any damage done. The incident occurred near Wootton Bassett Junction, Wiltshire. As a direct result of the incident Network Rail banned the train's operator, West Coast Railway Company (WCRC), from operating trains anywhere on the British railway network. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) opened an investigation into the incident, which it called a \\"dangerous occurrence\\". The incident was rated the most serious SPAD in the United Kingdom since December 2010. Following improvements made by WCRC, the ban was lifted. A subsequent incident led to a further ban, which was later lifted. In December 2015, the Office of Rail and Road initiated a prosecution against the driver of the train and WCRC for offences under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. The case was heard in June 2016. Both WCRC and the driver of the train pleaded guilty. WCRC was fined ¬£200,000 plus costs. The driver received a sentence of four months' imprisonment, suspended for eighteen months. In May 2016, the RAIB published a report on the incident, which largely blamed the incident on the train crew tampering with a safety system that would otherwise have safely brought the train to a halt. ==Incident== At 17:25 GMT on 7 March 2015, a charter train approached Wootton Bassett Junction, where the Great Western Main Line and South Wales Main Line diverge at Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire. In the approach to signal SN43, an Automatic Warning System (AWS) magnet was present in the trackbed, warning of a temporary speed restriction ahead. The line speed was . The temporary restriction of then in force did not apply to the train as steam locomotives are restricted to a maximum of on Network Rail (NR) tracks in any event. An emergency brake application occurred on the train after it had passed over the magnet because the driver failed to press the AWS cancelling button within 2.7 seconds. The driver should have allowed the train to come to a stand and contacted the signalman, but he did not. Instead the AWS isolating cock was operated, releasing the brake after the train's speed had been reduced from to about . This had the effect of isolating both the AWS and the Train Protection & Warning System (TPWS), rendering them unable to apply the brakes. Although the driver was permitted to operate the isolating cock under certain fault conditions, he did not follow rulebook protocol or inform the signaller that he had done so. The next signal, SN45, was displaying a red (danger) aspect. By the time the driver saw this, there was insufficient distance available to stop the train, which eventually came to a stand on the junction some past the signal. The service train that was being protected by the red signal had already passed through the junction and no collision occurred. As the points had already moved for the passage of the charter train, no damage was done to the trackwork at Wooton Bassett Jn. The line speed approaching the junction was for the service train. Before he was relieved from driving duties, the driver of the charter train claimed that signal SN43 had displayed a green (proceed) aspect. NR investigations showed that a single yellow (caution) aspect was displayed. Following the incident, the driver was relieved at . There a new driver was supplied by West Coast Railway Company (WCRC) who drove the train to , where the train was terminated. The incident was rated the most serious SPAD since December 2010, rating 25 out of 28 on Network Rail's scale. Any SPAD rated at 20 or more leads to a mandatory investigation by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR). The scale is logarithmic, with each increment rated twice as serious as the previous; thus the incident was rated as nominally over thirty times more serious than this threshold. The December 2010 SPAD was rated at 26, and was at Uphill Junction, Somerset, on the Bristol to Exeter line when a passenger train overran a signal by . The month before that incident, a passenger train overran a signal at , Staffordshire, in an incident rated at 25. RAIB investigation findings The RAIB investigation into the accident reported that the outward working, reporting number 1Z21, the 07:22 from to , had been fitted with a numbered plastic tie on the handle of the Automatic Warning System (AWS) isolating cock. The train was driven to Bristol without incident, although some misting of the driver's window was reported. The driver of that train was not the driver later involved in the SPAD at Wootton Bassett. During an empty coaching stock movement to St Philip's Marsh depot, the emergency brake applied because the driver did not cancel an AWS warning in the allotted time. The AWS isolating cock was opened, breaking the seal. On leaving St Philip's Marsh, a similar incident occurred, and the AWS isolating cock was opened again. There was a change of traincrew on arrival at Bristol Temple Meads, where the return working was designated 1Z67. According to the rulebook, the driver of the train should have reported the missing seal on the AWS isolating cock. The train should not have been allowed to depart until the cock had been sealed. The driver did not do this, and set off with an unsealed cock. Due to misting and exhaust obstructing the driver's view through the window, the driver drove leaning out of the cab for much of the time. A side effect of this was that it made hearing the AWS sounder harder, as well as observation of a flashing light fitted in the cab to remind a driver of an AWS warning. Approaching signal SN43, there was a temporary speed restriction of , which was warned of by a temporary AWS magnet in advance of the restriction, and indicated by a sign at the start of the temporary speed restriction. The train approached signal SN43 at and passed over the temporary AWS magnet. The driver failed to react to the warning given within the time allowed and the brakes were applied. Because the AWS isolating cock was out of reach of the driver, he instructed the fireman to open it for him. The train's speed had reduced by about when the brakes were released. The rules require that the train is brought to a stand and the signaller contacted in the event of an AWS brake application. Additionally the driver must inform the signaller whenever the AWS is isolated; > \\"Driver: If it becomes necessary to isolate the AWS, you must: * stop your > train immediately * tell the signaller * not move the train until instructed > to do so * carry out the instructions given.\\" The train then passed signal SN43, which was displaying a single yellow (caution) aspect. The driver acknowledged the AWS warning, but did not reduce speed. In the twelve seconds between brake application and brake release, the train passed over the fixed AWS magnet for signal SN43, which was displaying a single yellow (caution) aspect. This warning was cancelled in time. The train then passed over the TPWS+ overspeed sensor for signal SN45, which was displaying a red (danger) aspect. As the train was travelling more slowly than the trigger speed, no brake action was demanded from the train. The train then passed over the second TPWS overspeed sensor for signal SN45, this time at , which was in excess of the trigger speed. Consequently, a TPWS intervention occurred, but as the AWS isolating cock was open the brakes did not apply. When the driver saw that signal SN45 was at danger, he applied the brakes on the train. Due to there being insufficient distance to stop, the train overran the signal by and came to a stand across Wootton Basset Junction. Then the driver reported to the signaller by radio, claiming that the signals had not sequenced properly (i.e. that SN43 had been green). During the time that he was on the radio, the fireman closed the AWS isolating cock. The signaller initially treated the event as a Technical SPAR (i.e., Signal Passed at Red due to an Irregular Signal Sequence) because there was no SPAD alarm provided for signal SN45 and the driver had claimed that the preceding signal was displaying a green aspect. Because this is not a safety-critical event he authorised the driver to take the train forward to . However, by the time the train arrived at Swindon, it was understood that signal SN45 had been passed at danger without authority and the driver was relieved of his duties. The driver was not tested for the presence of drugs or alcohol in his system, as is required by Railway Group Standards. The investigation found that there was no evidence of alcohol in his system. Prescription drugs that he was taking were assessed as not having an effect on his ability to drive the train. Fatigue was found not to be a factor. The investigation found that crewing of the train was insufficient. There was no traction inspector on board. WCRC had discontinued the use of traction inspectors by 2012. A traction inspector's duties include assisting the driver with the sighting of signals. Two members of the train support crew were also on the footplate of Tangmere, but they had no responsibility in respect of the operation of the train. No problems were found with the ability to sight signals SN43 and SN45. The locomotive and carriages from the train were tested separately following the incident; no fault was found with either, although some of the sensors were not being recorded by the On Train Data Recorder (OTDR). The RAIB were able to reconstruct the sequence of events from the data that was recorded by the OTDR. The investigation found that the fixed AWS magnet for signal SN43 was incorrectly positioned. It was located from the signal, instead of the standard . The actual location of signal SN43 was closer to the junction than shown on signalling diagrams, which was at from London. These errors meant that the placing of the AWS magnet for the temporary speed restriction was also incorrect. Instead of being from the fixed AWS magnet, the temporary AWS magnet for the speed restriction was only from it. The installation of signal SN43 was in 1978, and the errors had remained undetected since then. An emergency speed restriction had been introduced in January 2015 due to the condition of the track, and had subsequently been converted to a temporary speed restriction. These errors were found not to have been contributory factors in the incident. The safety culture at WCRC was found by the investigation to be weak. This was evidenced by a number of factors, including the lack of traction inspectors, failure to test for drugs and alcohol, failure to download data from OTDRs to analyse individual driver performance, failure to maintain OTDR equipment correctly, failure to report missing seals on safety equipment where they were required to be fitted, failure to keep proper records, and failure to improve following the incident at Bell Busk (detailed below). ==Trains== First Great Western HST, similar to that which passed Wootton Bassett Junction a minute before the charter train came to a halt across the junction. Charter train The charter train, reporting number 1Z67, was a steam-hauled passenger train, the 16:35 Cathedrals Express charter from to , Essex. The train was hauled by Battle of Britain-class locomotive 34067 Tangmere (TOPS number 98 767). Tangmere was hauling thirteen carriages, which were a mixture of Mk 1s and Mk 2s. The train was operated by WCRC. There were 477 passengers and 39 staff on board the train. Service train The service train was the 15:28 to , reporting number 1L76. It was operated by a First Great Western InterCity 125 \\"High Speed Train\\", and was carrying about 240 passengers. ==Investigations== The Rail Accident Investigation Branch opened an investigation into the incident, which it called a \\"dangerous occurrence\\". One aspect of the investigation was whether the seals on the TPWS equipment were already broken before the train departed from Bristol, or were not in place at the time. In March 2016, the RAIB published an update on their investigation. The final report was released in May 2016. Five safety recommendations were made and one learning point was identified. The Rail Safety and Standards Board opened an investigation into the incident. The ORR opened two investigations; one into WCRC's Safety Management System, with the second a criminal investigation. The ORR subsequently charged WCRC and the driver of the train with various offences under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. WCRC also opened an internal investigation into the incident. == Ban == Network Rail Looking west over Wootton Bassett Junction Effective midnight on 3 April, NR banned WCRC from operating trains anywhere on the British railway network, stating in the suspension notice that \\"the operations of WCR are a threat to the safe operation of the railway\\". Seven areas of deficiencies were identified. WCRC was required to address five of them and show significant progress towards addressing the other two by 15 May. If this could be achieved, the ban would be lifted. During the period that WCRC was banned from the rail network, it was still required to pay Track Access Charges to Network Rail. This was the first time that a Train operating company had been banned in the United Kingdom. The SPAD at Wootton Bassett was the latest in a number of incidents involving WCRC, e.g. a charter train caused a trackside fire on the Leeds to Carnforth line. Following improvements made by WCRC, the ban was lifted on 8 May. A review of progress made was scheduled to be made after 3 months. Office of Rail and Road On 17 April, the ORR took steps to revoke WCRC's Safety Certificate. A process of representation was started, with parties having until 15 May to comment. The ORR's opinion was that WCRC's Safety Management System \\"is not able to ensure that services are being operated, designed or maintained safely\\". On 21 May 2015, the ORR issued WCRC an improvement notice under the Railways and Other Guided Transport Systems (Safety) Regulations 2006. == Previous incident == On 12 July 2014, a charter train operated by WCRC, reporting number 1Z57, caused a lineside fire at , North Yorkshire, The train was headed by Hall-class locomotive 5972 Olton Hall, which was hauling a charter train from , Lancashire to . The fire was caused by a defect in the locomotive's ash pan which allowed a piece of burning coal to fall from the locomotive and land alongside the track. Following the incident, WCRC was served with a Suspension Notice, which had the effect that WCRC was banned from operating steam locomotives on that route. It raised the issue with the Access Disputes Committee (ADC), calling Network Rail's actions \\"partial and malicious\\". The Suspension Notice was later partly lifted, allowing operation on routes where there was deemed not to be an enhanced fire risk. An investigation found that the crew of the train had not been advised that there was a raised fire risk at the time. WCRC was found not to have co-operated fully with the investigation. The ADC found that WCRC's Safety Management System was deficient due to confusion over whether or not the crew of the train had been informed of the increased fire risk. WCRC failed to inform Network Rail of its plans to try to prevent future incidents of a similar nature. The ADC found that this was in breach of WCRC's Safety Management System. WCRC chairman David Smith instructed his staff that no further correspondence would be gone into over the matter. The ADC found that this instruction was prejudicial to the safe operation of WCRC's Safety Management System. The instruction was later rescinded. WCRC was also found to be in breach of its Track Access Contract. ==Fallout== At the time of the ban, WCRC operated about 90% of all steam charter operations on Britain's railways. DB Schenker was the only other operator licensed to run steam trains on Network Rail tracks. DB Schenker has a policy of only operating air braked trains, whereas many trains operated by WCRC use vacuum brakes, which meant that DB Schenker was unable to operate those charters in place of WCRC. Steam Railway editor Howard Johnston said that the aftermath of the SPAD represented \\"possibly the greatest challenge to our movement\\". ASLEF General Secretary Mick Whelan called for better regulation of crew driving charter trains. Following the ban, eighteen charters were cancelled and eleven were postponed in the period 4 April ‚Äì 5 May. DB Schenker and GB Railfreight operated three charters each. Companies affected included Belmond, Compass, NENTA Traintours, PMR Railtours, Railway Touring Company, SRPS Railtours, Statesman Rail, Steam Dreams and Vintage Trains. On 6 May, it was reported that The Jacobite season was likely to start late due to the suspension. The trains, which run on the West Highland Line in Scotland, were due to start running on 11 May for the start of the 2015 season. Following the lifting of the ban on 8 May, it was announced that The Jacobite trains would run as scheduled from 11 May. In May 2015, Abellio ScotRail announced that as a result of the ban, it was reconsidering its decision to give WCRC preferred bidder status for a contract to run steam trains on the Waverley Line, which was scheduled to reopen between Edinburgh and in September 2015. In June 2015, it was reported that the ORR was planning to call a \\"Safety Summit\\" involving operators of charter trains on NR tracks. It was reported that one proposal to be put forward by the ORR was that all charter trains be limited to a maximum of eleven carriages. This, if enacted, would mean a loss of revenue of up to ¬£5,000 per train for operators. Part of the reasoning behind the proposal was that steam locomotives have a lower rate of acceleration than modern traction. As they are limited to , they have to be worked harder in order to maintain time. A reduction in train weight would make acceleration rates a little faster and reduce the need to work locomotives so hard. Despite many requests from Rail, WCRC chairman David Smith refused to comment on the incident. In an interview with Steam Railway, he stated that the company was working to satisfy the seven demands made by Network Rail, and was only cancelling trains about a week in advance, in the hope that WCRC would be able to run trains again in the future. Responding to a comment by Smith that \\"We are co-operating with the ORR in its enquiries, but from what we can see, all it is doing is keeping a watchful eye on what is going on\\", Rail editor Nigel Harris expressed astonishment at the \\"jaw-dropping\\" comments as criminal charges could lead to imprisonment following a guilty verdict. The reputational damage to WCRC was described as \\"possibly commercially fatal\\". Rail contributor Pip Dunn said that WCRC refused to talk to journalists when negative stories concerning the company were being reported, yet was happy to when publicising a charter it was running. On 28 May, WCRC issued a press release apologising for the distress, disappointment and inconvenience caused by the incident and events arising from it. It also thanked the ORR and others for assistance and support given. It stated that it was giving full assistance to the RAIB in respect of its investigation into the SPAD. In April 2015, Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate was considering whether or not to prosecute WCRC. The ORR also has powers to prosecute; they subsequently decided to prosecute both WCRS and the driver of the train. Although the suspension had been lifted by NR, the ORR could still have revoked WCRC's Safety Certificate at the end of the 28-day consultation period. The lifting of the suspension by NR was subject to a review after three months.  Great Britain VIII  Great Britain VIII was a nine-day railtour, one of an annual series, from London to Cornwall, then to Scotland, and back to London. Various steam locomotives were scheduled to haul the train on each day of the tour, which was to have been entirely steam- hauled. Participants paid between ¬£1,995 and ¬£2,895 per person for the nine- day tour, which ran from 28 April to 6 May 2015. Despite fears that the tour would be cancelled, it was run although with changes to the locomotives hauling it. DB Schenker agreed to operate the first two days of the tour. The tour suffered a number of issues including steam locomotives being replaced by diesels, and a lack of train heating; these resulted in a significant number of passengers leaving the tour early. == Subsequent incident and further ban == On 2 October 2015, Black 5 steam locomotive 45231 Sherwood Forester was working a WCRC special through Doncaster when it was noticed that its TPWS had been isolated by the fireman. As a result, in November 2015 a further prohibition notice was issued to WCRC by the ORR, suspending further steam services operated by them. It was reported that locomotives would need to have their TPWS modified to prevent the crew from being able to isolate it, before this suspension could be lifted. On 17 February 2016, the ORR served a Prohibition Notice on WCRC, citing a further seven incidents which had occurred since the SPAD at Wootton Bassett. The prohibition was to become effective from 18 February 2016 meaning that WCRC would \\"no longer be able to operate trains on the mainline network until such a time as [WCRC] can satisfy [the ORR] that its governance and operations meet industry practice and are fit for the scale of its operations\\". In addition the ORR found that the conditions for the revocation of WCRC's safety certificate had been met, which could have implications for WCRC's European train operator's licence. This second prohibition was lifted on 23 March 2016. ==Prosecution== On 9 December 2015, the ORR announced that WCRC and the driver of the train were to be prosecuted for offences contrary to the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. An initial hearing was scheduled to be heard at Swindon Magistrates Court on 11 January 2016, but postponed until 20 January. When the case opened, neither the driver Melvyn Cox nor WCRC entered pleas. The case was committed to Swindon Crown Court, where it was scheduled to be heard on 19 February; unconditional bail was granted to Cox. The case was subsequently postponed until 18 March, and then further postponed to an undisclosed date in May 2016. In late May, it was announced that the trial would begin on 27 June 2016. At the trial, both WCRC and Cox pleaded guilty. WCRC were fined ¬£200,000 plus costs of ¬£64,000. The fine imposed was half of the maximum that could have been imposed. This was decided by Judge Peter Blair QC after he took mitigating circumstances into account. Cox was sentenced to four months imprisonment, suspended for eighteen months. He was also ordered to do 80 hours unpaid work. Cox's counsel stated in court that \\"he would never drive trains again\\". ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * Category:Railway accidents in 2015 Category:Railway accidents and incidents in England Category:History of Wiltshire Category:2015 in England Category:Railway accidents involving a disregarded signal Category:2015 in British law Category:Accidents and incidents involving First Great Western Category:Accidents and incidents involving West Coast Railways Category:2016 in British law Category:March 2015 events in the United Kingdom ","title":"2015 Wootton Bassett SPAD incident"},{"id":"46412342","text":"Oeceoclades atrovirens is a terrestrial orchid species in the genus Oeceoclades.

Arriving in Queensland in 1883 at age 24, he took up Pineapple farming at Zillmere in the 1880s before establishing a fruit preserving factory in Fortitude Valley. Sumner was President of the Queensland Central Executive for the Labor Party, Controller of the Trade Boards and a Commissioner on the Commonwealth Price Fixing Board. He was also a director and guarantor for the Daily Standard. ==Political career== Before joining the Labour Party, Sumner was a supporter of the Kidston-Morgan ministry and later the Opposition group. At the 1907 state election, he was a candidate for the seat of Nundah and defeated Mt Atthow by 152 votes. He held the seat until the 1909 when the former member, Thomas Bridges, defeated Sumner by 178 votes. When the Labour Party starting forming governments in Queensland, it found much of its legislation being blocked by a hostile Queensland Legislative Council, where members had been appointed for life by successive conservative governments. After a failed referendum in May 1917, Premier Ryan tried a new tactic, and later that year advised the Governor, Sir Hamilton John Goold-Adams, to appoint thirteen new members whose allegiance lay with Labour to the Council.\\"Goold-Adams, Sir Hamilton John (1858‚Äì1920)\\" Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved 15 April 2015. Sumner was one of the thirteen new members, and went on to serve for four and a half years until the Council was abolished in March, 1922. ==Personal life== On 6 April 1886, Smith married Eliza Jane Robinson at Brisbane and together had three sons and four daughters. On 11 June 1927 he died at his home \\"Langton\\", Norman Parade, Eagle Junction, Brisbane in June 1927 after several months of illness.

She was Hadassah's president from 1976 until 1980, and while president she began Hadassah's practice of periodically holding its annual convention in Israel, with the first such Jerusalem held gathering in 1978. She was chairwoman of the Hadassah Medical Organization from 1980 to 1984. In 1983 Tannenbaum established Hadassah International. She also lobbied against a statement equating Zionism with racism which was included in an annex to a report to be considered at the final conference of the United Nations Decade for Women in 1985 in Nairobi, Kenya. As stated in It Takes a Dream: The Story of Hadassah (1997), by Marlin Levin, \\"Bernice asked [President Ronald] Reagan to publicly repudiate the U.N. resolution. He agreed and promised that the U.S. delegation would walk out of Nairobi if the Zionism-equals-racism resolution was included in the final conference declaration.\\" Tannenbaum also convinced the United States Senate to condemn the conference resolution and demand its withdrawal. She also flew to Kenya with a draft of the Senate resolution, where Maureen Reagan, President Reagan's daughter and the head of the American delegation, repeated the president's promise to withdraw from the conference if the resolution was included in the final conference delegation. Kenya then brokered a compromise in which Zionism was omitted from the final conference report. In 2003 Tannenbaum was awarded Hadassah's highest honor, the Henrietta Szold Award for Distinguished Humanitarian Service. ==References *Guide to the Executive Functions Records in the Hadassah Archives at the American Jewish Historical Society at the Center for Jewish History.

It aired on Fox in the United States on November 2, 2014. ==Plot== The basement storage space of the restaurant has a bug infestation and Bob has an exterminator come to check it out. However, the exterminator claims the basement is haunted and refuses to treat the infestation, claiming they need to make contact with the spirit to get rid of it. Linda and the kids decide to use a Ouija board to communicate with the ghost and trap it in a shoebox to get rid of it. Using the board, they learn that the ghost is a 13-year-old boy named Jeff, which piques TIna's interest. After \\"trapping\\" Jeff in the box, Tina refuses to throw \\"him\\" out and brings him with her to school. Tammy, Jocelyn, Zeke, and Jimmy Jr. taunt Tina about the box, until Louise has them all use the Ouija board to communicate with Jeff. They become convinced Jeff is real, and through the board, learn that Jeff is cool and that he has a crush on Tina. Meanwhile, word of the ghost sends two \\"ghost hunters\\" to the restaurant, who take up shop investigating paranormal activity around the premises. With Halloween fast approaching, their presence and the rumors of a ghost bring increased business to the restaurant. Tina and Jeff begin going out, earning her attention from her friends, though she has some doubts about whether Jeff is real. However, Tammy takes the box and claims that Jeff left a message written in steam on the girls' bathroom mirror that says he's breaking up with Tina and is now dating Tammy. Tina is heartbroken. The family tries to decide how to cheer Tina up and Louise reveals to the rest of the family that she controlled the Ouija board and made Jeff up, but did not anticipate that Tina would fall in love with him or that Tammy would one- up her by stealing Tina's popularity with a similar ruse. Louise and Gene resolve to get back at Tammy by scaring her on Halloween night when the older kids plan to enter a mausoleum in the nearby cemetery. Tina surprises them by joining the group and they head into the mausoleum, which immediately shuts and traps them inside in complete darkness. Louise takes this opportunity to steal the box and fill it with bugs from the restaurant and gives it back to Tammy to open. The kids light a candle and are frightened to find a message written in blood on the mausoleum walls, allegedly from Jeff, condemning them all to Hell. Scared, Tammy confesses that she wrote the fake breakup message and throws the box away, causing the bugs to swarm them all. Tina calms everyone down by revealing that she pretended the mausoleum door was locked and wrote the message before they arrived in ketchup to scare them, having realized long ago that Jeff was not real. She explains that they all believed in Jeff because he was able to give them something they wanted: Tina wanted a boyfriend, Zeke wanted to believe in the afterlife, Jocelyn wanted another way to conform, and Tammy wanted Jeff as a status symbol. Tina states that they can get these things from themselves, though they all agree that Tammy is terrible. Louise is impressed that Tina pulled such a great Halloween prank on all of them. Meanwhile, wrapping up their investigation, the ghost hunters leave, claiming that their paranormal services balance out their tab at the restaurant. When Bob and Linda refuse, they try to claim that they too are ghosts, but Bob forces them to pay their tab. ==Reception== Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, citing the series' strength of understanding and firmly establishing its characters, stating \\"‚ÄúTina And The Real Ghost‚Äù is Bob‚Äôs Burgers finding new ways to explore its kid characters and their relationship dynamics, and all it needs to get that process started is one very cool ghost in a shoebox.\\" Robert Ham of Paste gave the episode an 8.7 out of 10, saying \\"The plot was decidedly thin, but it was really its own vessel to move young Tina one step forward toward maturity. For a character that usually winds up stumbling and fumbling through life, it was nice to see her score a decisive victory for once.\\" The episode received a 1.5 rating and was watched by a total of 2.89 million people. This made it the third most watched show on Fox that night, losing to Brooklyn Nine-Nine and The Simpsons. ==References External links == * * Category:2014 American television episodes Category:Bob's Burgers (season 5) episodes Category:Halloween television episodes ","title":"Tina and the Real Ghost"},{"id":"46413032","text":"Parker Maher (born July 12, 1993) is an American soccer player. ==Career== College Maher played his entire college soccer career at Missouri State University between 2011 and 2014.

It was one of a spate of albums which capitalized on the success of 1968's Switched-On Bach by Wendy Carlos. Switched-On Rock was produced by Norman Dolph who also wrote the liner notes. Dolph worked in the studio with colleagues Kenny Ascher and Alan Foust; they billed themselves as the Moog Machine for this and one more project. The album reached number 170 on the Billboard Top 200. ==Background== Norman Dolph joined Columbia Records in 1964. As a marketing executive, he focused on recording projects aimed at the youth market. In 1967 he paid for the recording session of the album The Velvet Underground & Nico, and he helped engineer it. After the 1968 album Switched-On Bach was seen to sell 500,000 copies, a number of albums were made to satisfy this new demand for synthesizer music. Wendy Carlos followed up Switched-On Bach with The Well- Tempered Synthesizer in the classical music category. Popular albums such as Switched On Bacharach, Switched-On Country, Switched-On Santa, Switched-On Gershwin, Moog Power and Music to Moog By were produced by others. ==Production== The idea for Switched-On Rock was conceived by Columbia Records marketing executive Russell \\"Russ\\" Barnard. Barnard assigned the project to three men: Dolph supervised the album and he tuned the Moog modular synthesizer, and his associates jazz pianist Kenneth \\"Kenny\\" Ascher and arranger Alan Foust played the keyboards and wrote the song arrangements, respectively. An attempt was made to synthesize drum sounds for the songs, but Dolph felt that the results sounded \\"kind of mechanical and ricky-tick.\\" Instead, a rock drum kit was played by session drummer Leon Rix.Dolph, Norman; Ballard, Russ. (1969) Switched-On Rock liner notes. Partially reproduced in Mark Jenkins (2009), Analog Synthesizers: Understanding, Performing, Buying ‚Äì From the Legacy of Moog to Software Synthesis. CRC Books, page 143. The Moog synthesizer was difficult to work with, as it is a very complex device with many knobs, and a slight movement of any knob could radically change the sound. It also tended to drift in musical pitch such that Dolph determined to tune it every 15 minutes. Finally, the Moog was monophonic, meaning that only one note could be played at a time. If a chord was fingered on the Moog's keyboard, only the lowest note would sound; chords heard on the album were built up over several takes, or they were synthesized on a chordal device called the \\"protorooter\\". The songs were arranged by Foust as if any conceivable texture was available; following his charts, the Moog was tuned to synthesize each imagined texture. Some of the sounds heard on the album were discovered by \\"auspicious\\" accident while working toward something else. Using a 16-channel tape recorder, all ten songs were built up track-by-track in parallel; once a certain basic Moog sound was achieved, it could be used as appropriate for each song, with slight adjustments. Approximately 150 different textures were synthesized on the Moog for the album. In addition to the drum kit there was one other non-Moog instrument; in the liner notes Dolph challenged the listener to identify this instrument. Dolph said that the production team coined new words for some of the Moog textures, for instance they decided the word \\"gwiping\\" would describe \\"the act of sweeping a filter with a high regeneration setting... from top to bottom.\\" Accordingly, a basic Moog organ sound which was \\"gwiped\\" became a \\"gworgan\\". They also coined \\"pagwipe\\" (a leaky bagpipe), \\"jivehive\\" (many bees swarming on the same pitch) and the \\"sweetswoop\\" (the roaring of a jet with harmonics). ==Personnel== *Kenny Ascher ‚Äì keyboards *Alan Foust ‚Äì arranger *Norman Dolph ‚Äì producer, tuner *Leon Rix ‚Äì drums *Stew Romain ‚Äì engineer *Fred Plaut ‚Äì engineer *Frank Laico ‚Äì engineer *Art Kendy ‚Äì engineer *George Engfer ‚Äì engineer *George Knuerr ‚Äì equipment *Ron Pellegrino ‚Äì production assistant *Barney Beck ‚Äì production assistant *Russell Barnard ‚Äì concept *John McClure ‚Äì executive producer *Alan Kaplan ‚Äì front cover image ==Legacy== After Switched-On Rock was released, Dolph, Ascher and Foust quickly regrouped as the Moog Machine to create one more album, this time featuring Christmas songs. The album Christmas Becomes Electric was released in late 1969. In 1972, Isao Tomita produced a similar album of rock covers using the Moog synthesizer, titled Electric Samurai: Switched on Rock. Tomita also incorporated his experiments in voice synthesis. Switched-On Rock has been sampled by a handful of artists. In 1994, the Beastie Boys sampled the Moog Machine's cover version of \\"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\\" for their song \\"Get It Together\\", using the sample prominently as a loop. The same song was also sampled by Slum Village in 1996 for the song \\"Fantastic 3\\" on their self-titled album. In 2000 the Avalanches used several samples of \\"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\\" for the songs \\"Close to You\\" and \\"Diners Only\\" on their debut album Since I Left You, an album which used approximately 3,500 samples from a wide range of vinyl pressings. Other songs that have been sampled include \\"You Keep Me Hangin' On\\" (\\"Special Delivery\\" by G. Dep feat. P. Diddy in 2001) and \\"Hey Jude\\" (\\"Delik\\" by the Chemical Brothers in 2003). The first few seconds of \\"The Weight\\" has been used for the air check for the Mexican cross-border station XERB-AM and is frequently heard on clips of XERB DJ Wolfman Jack. ==References== Category:1969 albums Category:Columbia Records albums Category:Covers albums Category:Electronic rock albums ","title":"Switched-On Rock"},{"id":"46413278","text":"Rocco Anthony Quattrocchi (January 13, 1927 - April 10, 2015) was an American politician and businessman.

The transcription factor is encoded by the TBX4 gene located on human chromosome 17. Tbx4 is known mostly for its role in the development of the hindlimb, but it also plays a critical role in the formation of the umbilicus. Tbx4 has been shown to be expressed in the allantois, hindlimb, lung and proctodeum. == Function == Expression of Tbx4 is activated by a combined \\"caudal\\" Hox code, expressing a specified positional code that includes Pitx1 gene expression. The encoded protein plays a major role in limb development, specifically during limb bud initiation. For instance, in chickens Tbx4 specifies hindlimb status. The activation of Tbx4 and other T-box proteins by Hox genes activates signaling cascades that involve the Wnt signaling pathway and FGF signals in limb buds. Ultimately, Tbx4 leads to the development of apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) signaling centers in the developing limb bud, which specify the orientation growth of the developing limb. Together with Tbx5, Tbx4 plays a role in patterning the soft tissues (muscles and tendons) of the musculoskeletal system. == Mutations == Duplication of the 17q23.1‚Äìq23.2 region, which includes the Tbx4 gene, has been reported to result in congenital clubfoot. Tbx4 duplication within this region has been determined to be the gene that leads to this phenotype. TBX4 gene mutations lead to an autosomal-dominant disorder called small patella syndrome, also known as Scott-Taor syndrome, which is characterized by patellar aplasia and abnormalities of the pelvis and feet. Mutations in the TBX4 that cause small patella syndrome are also associated with childhood-onset pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Deletion of 17q23.2 (which includes the TBX4 gene) or a point mutation in the TBX4 gene is reported in 30% of patients with childhood- onset PAH, whereas TBX4 gene mutations are associated with low frequency in adult-onset PAH patients (2%). Using targeted mutagenesis of Tbx4 in the mouse, various abnormalities were observed in the development of the allantois. Choirioallantoic fusion fails to occur in embryos with the homozygous null allele resulting in death 10.5 days post coitus, embryos with the Tbx4-mutant gene were observed to have allantoises that were apoptotic, stunted, and displayed abnormal differentiation with endothelial cells resulting in the absence of vascular remodeling. ==Role== Tbx4 is a transcription factor and member of the T-box family, which have been shown to play important role in fetal development. Tbx4 is expressed in a wide variety of tissues during organogenesis, including the hindlimb, proctodeum, mandibular mesenchyme, lung mesenchyme, atrium of the heart and the body wall. Tbx4 is specifically expressed in the visceral mesoderm of the lung primordium and governs multiple processes during respiratory tract development such as initial endodermal bud development, respiratory endoderm formation, and septation of the respiratory tract and esophagus. Along with Tbx4, Tbx5 is also expressed to help with development of limbs.Carlson: Human Embryology and Developmental Biology, 4th Edition. Copyright 2009 by Mosby. 184-205. Tbx4 is expressed in the hindlimb, whereas Tbx5 is expressed in the forelimb, heart, and dorsal side of the retina. Studies have shown that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) play a key role in limb initiation. In a developing embryo a gradient of retinoic acid aids in the combinatorial patterns of Hox gene expression along the body axis, which causes regions of the paraxial mesoderm to emit a signal to the lateral mesoderm that causes the expression of Tbx4 and Tbx5. When these two molecules are expressed that stimulate the secretion of FGF-10, which will induce the ectoderm to produce FGF-8. FGF-8 and FGF-10 together promote limb development. Mutations or teratogens that interfere with Tbx4/Tbx5 or FGF-8/FGF-10 has the ability to cause a child to be born without one or more limbs. A common syndrome seen with a mutation these genes is Tetra-Amelia syndrome which is characterized by the absence of all four limbs and anomalies involving the cranium and the face; eyes; urogenital system; heart; lungs and central nervous system. In a study done by Naiche et al. they generated a knockout mouse in which it lacked the expression on Tbx4 this mouse resulted in a phenotype of no limb formation. ==References== Category:Transcription factors ","title":"TBX4"},{"id":"46413619","text":"Alexander Barybin (born in Orel, Russia)Barybin Alexander is a Russian politician. == Biography == In 1954 he moved to Melitopol.

Mandibles of the bear were found in Bachatsk Quarry, Krasni Yar (in Tomsk Province) and Mokhovo Quarry; skull fragments were found in Krasni Yar. == Description == The small cave bear had a very broad, domed skull with a steep forehead. Its stout body had long thighs, massive shins and in-turning feet, making it similar in skeletal structure to the brown bear. Cave bears were comparable in size to the largest modern-day bears. ==Diet== Cave bear teeth show greater wear than most modern bear species, suggesting a diet of tough materials. However, tubers and other gritty food, which cause distinctive tooth wear in modern brown bears, do not appear to have constituted a major part of cave bears' diets on the basis of dental microwear analysis.Pinto Llona, A.

The morphological features of the cave bear chewing apparatus, including loss of premolars, have long been suggested to indicate their diets displayed a higher degree of herbivory than the Eurasian brown bear. Indeed, a solely vegetarian diet has been inferred on the basis of tooth morphology. Results obtained on the stable isotopes of cave bear bones also point to a largely vegetarian diet in having low levels of nitrogen-15 and carbon-13, which are accumulated at a faster rate by carnivores as opposed to herbivores. Cave bears of the last Ice Age lacked the usual two or three premolars present in other bears; to compensate, the last molar is very elongated, with supplementary cusps.Gli orsi spel√®i delle Conturines/ Ursus Spelaeus.

The electoral system was introduced for the first time in 1847, and 4 of the 7 board members were elected by the rate payers. In 1852 the board was replaced by a new one and in 1863 a new body was formed. As per old records, in 1872 there were 25 wards in Kolkata (spellings as in use at that time) ‚Äì 1. Shyampukur, 2.

A new municipal corporation was created in 1876, wherein 48 commissioners were elected and 24 were appointed by the government. With the implementation of the Municipal Consolidation Act of 1888 the area under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation was enlarged. Certain areas were already there but more parts of them were added (current spellings) - Entally, Manicktala, Beliaghata, Ultadanga, Chitpur, Cossipore, Beniapukur, Ballygunge, Watganj and Ekbalpur, and Garden Reach and Tollygunj. The Calcutta Municipal Act of 1923 brought about important changes. It liberalised the constitution along democratic lines.Bagchi, Amiya Kumar, Wealth and Work in Calcutta, 1860-1921, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol. I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, p. 213-215, Oxford University Press, .

HES7 is a member of the Hairy and Enhancer of Split families of Basic helix-loop-helix proteins. The gene product is a transcription factor and is expressed cyclically in the presomitic mesoderm as part of the Notch signalling pathway. HES7 is involved in the segmentation of somites from the presomitic mesoderm in vertebrates. The HES7 gene is self-regulated by a negative feedback loop in which the gene product can bind to its own promoter. This causes the gene to be expressed in an oscillatory manner. The HES7 protein also represses expression of Lunatic Fringe (LFNG) thereby both directly and indirectly regulating the Notch signalling pathway. Mutations in HES7 can result in deformities of the spine, ribs and heart. Spondylocostal dysostosis is a common disease caused by mutations in the HES7 gene. The inheritance pattern of Spondylocostal dysostosis is autosomal recessive. == Gene == The HES7 transcription factor belongs to the Hairy and Enhancer of split families of bHLH transcription factors. The gene that encodes the human HES7 protein is 5kb long and is found on chromosome 17, on the short arm at position 13.1. from base pair 8,120,590 to 8,126,032. In mice, HES7 is located on chromosome 11. HES7 has 62 known orthologues. The HES7 gene is expressed in the presomitic mesoderm where expression fluctuates in two hour cycles. HES7 is regulated by the Notch signalling pathway that functions in vertebrates and invertebrates by mediating cell fate and differentiation. The HES7 gene product functions to repress expression of genes with promoters containing an N-box or E-box. HES7 also has been shown to negatively regulate expression of genes activated by the E47 transcription factor. HES7 regulates its own expression through a negative feedback loop by binding to its own promoter. This feedback mechanism allows the HES7 protein to accumulate and be degraded so that its expression oscillates in a two-hour cycle. HES7 also negatively regulates Lunatic Fringe protein (Lfng). Lfng encodes an acetylglucosaminyl transferase that regulates expression in the Notch signalling pathway. By self-regulating and regulating the Lfng protein, HES7 both directly and indirectly alters expression in the Notch signalling pathway.  Mutations  Several mutations in HES7 have been associated with disease. = Common mutations in humans = Mutations to HES7 can lead to abnormalities in formation of heart, vertebral and neural tube. Homozygous mutations in HES7 have been associated with spondylocostal dystostosis and dextrocardia. Dextrocardia may be accompanied by situs invertus. A single nucleotide mutation in the 3'UTR has been associated with Coats Plus Syndrome in addition to Dextrocardia. = Animal models = Studies of animal embryos have linked mutations in HES7 to congenital scoliosis. In canines, exonic deletions in HES7 have been shown to mirror human disease and cause spondylocostal dystostosis in miniature Schnauzer dogs. Missense mutations in HES7 have been linked to short and kinked tails in Asian Domestic Cats. Homozygotes for a V2A missense mutation in a conserved vertebrate sequence of HES7 resulted in kinked tails while heterozygotes for the mutation presented with moderately kinked tails. == Protein == Studies with mouse HES7 have demonstrated that the gene contains 4 exons. There are three known human HES7 variants due to alterative splicing. The gene product is a transcription factor protein. The Helix-loop-helix domain is located at the N-terminal end of the protein. Both the human and the mouse protein have been shown to contain 225 amino acids and feature an orange domain as well as a conserved sequence of four amino acids at the C-terminal end. The four amino acids are Tryptophan-Arginine-Proline- Tryptophan. This conserved sequence of four amino acids binds Groucho/TLE family members. Groucho/TLE are transcriptional corepressors. Hairy-related proteins can direct these transcriptional corepressors to target genes. Orange domains are motifs of ~35 amino acids that are found on the C-terminal side of basic helix-loop-helix domains in some transcription factors in eukaryotic organisms. Proteins with Orange domains are divided into four subfamilies, three in which all proteins contain a basic helix-loop-helix domain. The subfamilies that contain Orange domains and basic helix-loop-helix domains are Hairy, Enhancer of Split, and Hey. Transcription factors with Orange domains bind DNA and regulate biological processes such as cell differentiation and embryonic patterning. == Function == The HES7 protein is a transcription factor that functions as a transcriptional repressor. It is involved in somitogenesis, an important cycle in vertebrate development. Somitogenesis involves the early segmentation of vertebrates. HES7 is involved in segmenting the presomitic mesoderm into somites. Oscillating expression of HES7 in the presomitic mesoderm occurs in a two-hour cycle and is regulated by a negative feedback loop. This cycle of accumulation and degradation of the HES7 protein has been proposed as the basis for the somite segmentation clock. The cyclic nature of HES7 relies on proteasome-mediated degradation. Each cycle of HES7 expression coincides with the formation of a pair of somites. The half life of the HES7 protein is thought to be essential for proper function of the HES7 gene. The importance of accuracy in the two hour expression cycle was highlighted in an experiment where mice expressing HES7 with a mutation that allowed for a longer half life while retaining normal repressor function presented with abnormal segmentation. The 3'UTR was demonstrated as necessary for sufficient accumulation of HES7 protein to function. This was determined when transcripts with an improperly spliced intron in the 3'UTR were degraded prematurely. The correct number of introns has also been demonstrated as necessary to maintain the cyclic rhythm. Shortening the delay in accumulation of the HES7 protein by reducing the number of introns resulted in an increased number of somites. == Related conditions == Nonfunctional HES7 protein results in errors in segmentation of the presomitic mesoderm. Mutations can result in malformed spine, ribs, heart and neural tube. The following conditions can result from errors in segmentation due to mutations in HES7: *Spondylocostal dysostosis is characterized by abnormalities of the spine and ribs. Vertebrae may be fused together or abnormally shaped. Rib bones also may be fused together or missing entirely. These abnormalities can result in scoliosis. These symptoms lead to dwarfism where an individual has a shortened body length with legs and arms of regular length. The inheritance pattern of Spondylocostal dysostosis is autosomal recessive. * Dextrocardia is characterized by the heart pointing to the right side of the chest, when it normally points to the left. Dextrocardia may or may not be accompanied by situs inversus. * Dextrocardia with Situs inversus results when, in addition to the heart, the major visceral organs of the body form in the mirror image of their normal positioning. * Scoliosis is characterized by a curvature of the spine. The curve may be C-shaped or S-shaped. * Spina bifida is a neural tube defect. It is characterized by a malformed spine when the neural tube does not properly close correctly. Spina bifida may cause physical and intellectual disability. Types of spina bifida that have been documented in individuals homozygous for mutations in HES7 are Spina bifida occulta and Myelomeningocele. * Chiari malformation results from neural tube defects and affects the base of the skull and the cerebellum. With Chiari malformation, the cerebellum extends lower than the base of the skull into the upper spinal canal. * ==References == Category:Transcription factors ","title":"HES7 gene"},{"id":"46413900","text":"Delphin-Verlag was a German publishing house founded in Munich in 1911 by Richard Landauer (1882‚Äì1960).

As of September 24, 2015, the film has grossed $104,808 in North America. Critical response Adult Beginners received generally mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 48% approval rating based on reviews from 79 critics, with an average score of 5.76/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Perfectly pleasant yet never particularly engaging, Adult Beginners is a mild middle-of-the-road comedy content to coast on the charms of its talented cast.\\" Metacritic gives the film a score of 57 out of 100 based on reviews from 26 critics. Adult Beginners gained a fairly positive response at the Toronto International Film Festival, with Nikola Grozdanovic of Indiewire giving it a B+ grade, saying \\"it‚Äôs not perfect, but as far as feature debuts go, there‚Äôs very little you can fault Adult Beginners for. Slightly pedantic and maudlin at times, with telegraphed metaphors and some rushed pacing, it‚Äôs still hard to call any of these hiccups major flaws. Katz, with the help of an inspired cast and an emotionally intelligent and mature screenplay, has succeeded in depicting the trials and tribulations of adults who, all for respectfully different yet equally weighty reasons, often make a three-year-old the most mature person in the room.\\" He also praised the supporting roles of McHale, Krawkowski, and particularly Moynihan. Phil Brown of Collider gave the film a B- grade calling it \\"cute\\". \\"It‚Äôs a very heartfelt, sweet, funny, moving and deliberately small movie that does exactly what it‚Äôs supposed to do and then rolks [sic] credits before wearing out it‚Äôs [sic] welcome.

[...] Still, those imperfections are forgivable, even fitting, for a modest, well-assembled charmer that represents a welcome branching out for most of the key talents involved.\\" Furthermore, at the South by Southwest Film Festival, Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound said \\"you don‚Äôt need to rush out and see Adult Beginners.

On 14 April 2015, the Airbus A320-232 aircraft touched down short of the runway, struck the localizer array, skidded onto the runway on its tail, and spun 120 degrees before finally coming to a rest on the grass, opposite the terminal building. The aircraft suffered substantial damage to the left wing and engine. Of the 82 people aboard, 27 (25 passengers and two crew) were injured, one seriously. ==Aircraft and crew== The aircraft involved, an Airbus A320-200 registration HL7762, was delivered new to Asiana Airlines in 2007, making the aircraft seven years old at the time of the accident. The aircraft was written off as a result of the incident, making it the 32nd hull loss of an Airbus A320. The captain was an unnamed 47-year-old male who had 8,242 flight hours, including 1,318 hours on the Airbus A320. The first officer was an unnamed 35-year-old male who had 1,588 flight hours, with 1,298 of them on the Airbus A320. ==Accident== Landing path of Flight 162 at Hiroshima The transport ministry‚Äôs Osaka Regional Civil Aviation Bureau stated that the crew tried to land the aircraft in darkness and inclement weather without access to an instrument landing system. At this airport, aircraft normally approach from the west because the instrument landing system is installed only at the eastern end of the runway. On this occasion, the pilot was instructed by an air traffic controller to approach from the east due to the wind direction. Bureau officials were reported to have stated that the pilot attempted to land in poor weather with low visibility while using such aids as the lighting near the centre-line of the runway that indicates glide angles (normally used in good weather conditions). ==Investigation== HL7762 in open storage at Hiroshima Airport following the accident The Japanese Transportation Safety Board (JTSB) opened an investigation into the accident. Hiroshima Prefecture Prefectural police also launched an investigation on 15 April. South Korean investigators and airline officials traveled to Japan to join the investigation on 15 April. On 16 April, investigators began debriefing the captain and first officer. One investigator from the JTSB stated that a downdraft during approach may have contributed to the inadequate altitude at the runway threshold. The METAR (weather conditions) for the time did not indicate any unusual weather or wind shear. The weather was low overcast with almost no wind. Recovered flight data shows that, after autopilot disconnect, the aircraft began a slow and controlled descent below the normal glide slope approach path about 4 km prior to impact. It struck the localizer before the runway threshold in a nose-high attitude short of the runway, with the main gear making contact with the ground further on. After exiting the runway, the aircraft rotated until it came to rest facing the direction it had landed from. ==See also== * Accidents and incidents involving the Airbus A320 family * Asiana Airlines Flight 214 * Air Canada Flight 624 ==References * Final Report by Japan Transport Safety Board - English translation and Original Japanese version - In case of a conflict in meaning and intepretation between the two, the Japanese report prevails. * The response from MOLIT to the safety recommendation - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) * \\"Information on HL7762 from Seoul(Incehon) to Hiroshima.\\" Asiana Airlines. * \\"Airbus A320 ‚Äì Flight OZ 162 ‚ÄìHiroshima Airport (Japan) ‚Äì 14 April 2015\\" (Archive).

God Help the Child was first published by Alfred A. Knopf on April 30, 2015. ==Plot== A young girl with blue-black skin is neglected and abused by the light-skinned parents who are ashamed of her. Lula Ann Bridewell, who calls herself \\"Bride\\", is blue-black beautiful, the kind of woman who turns heads wherever she goes. She is tall, elegant, and dresses only in white, the better to reflect her beauty. But Bride did not always know her beauty or how to wear it. As a child, her mother Sweetness punished Bride for her dark skin, which ended her marriage. Sweetness‚Äôs husband Louis could not bring himself to love a child with skin as dark as Bride‚Äôs. \\"We had three good years,\\" Sweetness tells us, \\"but when she was born, he blamed me and treated Lula Ann like she was a stranger, more than that, an enemy.\\" Her mother, meanwhile, insisted her child call her Sweetness instead of anything maternal. Bride grew up without love, tenderness, affection or apology. Sweetness makes it clear she saw herself as protecting her child from a world that would be even more inclined to punish Bride for the darkness of her skin. While Sweetness will apologize for her child‚Äôs dark skin, what she will not apologize for is how she sees the world and how she raises her child, saying: \\"Some of you probably think it‚Äôs a bad thing to group ourselves according to skin color ‚Äì the lighter, the better ‚Äì in social clubs, neighborhoods, churches, sororities, even colored schools. But how else can we hold on to a little dignity?\\" This is what makes it so difficult to judge Sweetness‚Äôs choices. She should know better, but it is painfully clear her choices have been shaped by the realities of being black in a white world ‚Äì a world where the lighter your skin, the higher you might climb. ==Reception== Morrison and her publishers announced they were publishing the book in December 2014, causing Gawker to jokingly proclaim it the best novel of 2015 based on the synopsis and Morrison's previous work alone.

He grows fond of her and asks her to marry him so that he can leave his millions to her instead of his son Arthur (Strong). She refuses, so he makes a new will and places an envelope in her hands that she is to open sixty days after his death. Howard dies and Annabelle is considered responsible. She finds it impossible to obtain work and after suffering and close to starvation she answers an advertisement for a temporary wife. It turns out that it was placed by Arthur who, by the terms of his father's will, must marry some other woman than Verna Devore (Boland), a fortune seeker whom his father opposed. Annabelle consents to the temporary arrangement after opening the letter after sixty days and discovering that she has inherited the Eliot fortune. Through the influence of Judge Laton (Breese), Verna is cast aside and Arthur's temporary wife becomes permanent. ==Cast== *Rubye De Remer as Annabelle Rose *Edmund Breese as Judge Laton *Eugene Strong as Arthur Eliot *Mary Boland as Verna Devore *William T.

Prior to the tornado, the creek and falls was not visible by road. People had to climb down several rock stairways to take a glimpse. However, once the tornado ripped all the trees away, the falls were clear enough to be seen from the roadway. Due to the extensive damage and location of the falls, not much could be done to rebuild the area for quite some time.

The company has been criticized for developing phone tracking technologies that can be used outside prisons and for charging very high rates for calls, in addition to pushing to mandate the removal of in-person meetings of inmates with their families. Securus is owned by Beverly Hills-based private equity firm Platinum Equity. ==History== Securus was founded as TZ Holdings Inc. in 1986 in Dallas, Texas. The company changed its name from TZ Holdings Inc. to Securus Technologies in April 2009. During the 2010s, Securus was one of a number of companies which provided telephone service to inmates in US prisons. Securus was partially acquired by ABRY Partners from Castle Harlan in 2013 for $640 million. The company was the target of a data breach of about 70 million records of phone calls in July 2015. Since its inception, Securus has acquired 20 government services, software-based businesses, technologies, patents and exclusive partner agreements. The company was acquired in 2017 by Beverly Hills-based private equity firm Platinum Equity, owned by billionaire Tom Gores. In 2019, Platinum Equity announced plans to reorganize the company as a more diverse technology company, and created Aventiv Technologies as Securus' new corporate parent. ==Operations== Securus is headquartered in Dallas, Texas with regional offices located in Carrollton, Texas, Allen, Texas, and Atlanta, Georgia. The company employs approximately 1,000 people and is reported to have contracts with 2,600 correctional facilities in the United States. ==Communication costs== Prices for calls vary greatly among institutions, with first-minute charges from over to 4 cents, and from over to 4 cents for subsequent minutes. Prices of out-of-state calls were capped by the FCC to around 21 cents per minute; however, instate rates at many jails and prisons continue to be much higher. In 2017, the company announced its Wireless Containment Solution, which was developed to prevent contraband cell phones from connecting to mobile networks. As of November 2017, the company reported that the Wireless Containment Solution system has blocked 1.7 million inmate calls from prisons. On May 10, 2018, The New York Times revealed that one of Securus' products can be used to track the location of almost any phone in the US within seconds. Senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) has sent letters to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and telecommunications companies demanding answers on the controversial surveillance system. The prison phone industry has been criticized for charging high fees and profiting off of vulnerable inmates. In 2019, New York City passed a bill ensuring 21 minutes of free phone calls for all inmates in New York City jails; before the bill, the phone contract with Securus had generated $5 million in revenue for the city and $2.5 million for Securus. ==See also== *Managed access (corrections) *Inmate telephone system ==References External links == * Category:1986 establishments in Texas Category:Companies based in Dallas Category:Companies established in 1986 Category:Technology companies of the United States Category:Videotelephony ","title":"Securus Technologies"},{"id":"46414207","text":"Five Star Generals is the third mixtape by the Christian hip hop group Hostyle Gospel, released by Hostyle Gospel Ministries in 2008. \\\\- \\\\- ==Reception== In a four star review by Journal of Gospel, Bob Marovich wrote, \\"Five Star Generals is well produced and engineered.

The case concerns the personal liability of a director of a one-man company for negligent misstatement and applied the principle of Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass that where a director is the \\"directing mind\\" of a company, his actions are legally those of the company. The application of the case by New Zealand courts during the leaky homes crisis has been described as a \\"barrier to litigants recovering from directors of these companies\\". ==Background== Trevor Ivory Ltd was a one- man company run by Trevor Ivory in the Nelson province and described as \\"agricultural and horticultural supplies and advisory service\\". In 1983, Trevor Ivory Limited entered into an oral contract with raspberry orchardists for the provision of consultancy services and the supply of sprays and fertilisers. The orchardists sought advice under the agreement about the spread of couch grass which was threatening their raspberry plantation and in March 1985 Mr Ivory recommended a trial spray of Roundup. The trial spray had no immediate ill-effects and so Mr Ivory advised spraying all of the couch grass with Roundup. President Cooke described what happened thus, The raspberry orchardists sued Trevor Ivory in negligence and Heron J in the Nelson High Court found in their favour and awarded damages of $145,332 plus interest. The award of damages was made on the basis that the company was liable for breach of contract and negligent misstatement and that Mr Ivory was also personally liable for negligent misstatement.Trevor Ivory Ltd v Anderson [1992] 2 NZLR 517 at 519. Mr Ivory and Trevor Ivory Ltd appealed the decision that he was personally liable for negligent misstatement; the judges alleged failure to consider contributory negligence; and the quantum of damages. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal except on the question of personal liability.Trevor Ivory Ltd v Anderson [1992] 2 NZLR 517 at 517. ==Judgments== The main point that the Court considered was whether Mr Ivory was personally liable for negligent advice given in the course of his company's operations. The unanimous decision of the Court was that Mr Ivory was not personally liable An orchard of raspberries had been killed by the negligent application of Roundup to a couch grass infestation. Cooke P In his judgement Cooke P restated the \\"elementary\\" law that \\"an incorporated company and any shareholder are separate legal entities, no matter that the shareholder may have absolute control.\\"Trevor Ivory Ltd v Anderson [1992] 2 NZLR 517 at 520. Cooke P then surveyed Commonwealth case law that showed that a company officer or agent may, in certain circumstances, \\"come under a personal duty to a third party, breach of which ay entail personal liability\\".Trevor Ivory Ltd v Anderson [1992] 2 NZLR 517 at 520. Expanding on this point Cooke P noted, Hardie Boys J In his own judgement Justice Hardie Boys discussed the central importance of a director assuming responsibility, either expressly or by imputation and, noted the current case was \\"approaching the borderline\\"Trevor Ivory Ltd v Anderson [1992] 2 NZLR 517 at 528. and that, \\"It may be that in the present case there would have been a sufficient assumption of responsibility had Mr Ivory undertaken to do the spraying himself, but it is not necessary to consider that possibility.\\"Trevor Ivory Ltd v Anderson [1992] 2 NZLR 517 at 527. Hardie Boys J stated that one of the key hurdles in this area of law was establishing that a director owed a personal duty of care because his acts were his acts as the agent of the company and not of the company itself.Trevor Ivory Ltd v Anderson [1992] 2 NZLR 517 at 527. This could happen in certain situations, Hardie Boys J believed, \\"Assumption of responsibility may well arise or be imputed where the director or employee exercises particular control or control over a particular operation or activity\\".Trevor Ivory Ltd v Anderson [1992] 2 NZLR 517 at 527. McGechan J Justice McGechan concurred with the rest of the Court, expressly noting of the argument given by counsel for the raspberry orchardists, \\"It may indeed be drawing the long bow to apply a Hedley Byrne approach so as to impose personal liability upon the managing director of a one-man company, in rural New Zealand\\".Trevor Ivory Ltd v Anderson [1992] 2 NZLR 517 at 530. ==Significance== The case remains the benchmark in New Zealand law for establishing whether a director's action are those of the company or those of herself as an individual. However this area of law, which has received frequent attention due to the leaky homes crisis, remains unstable. The importance of the case has been eroded by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Body Corporate 202254 v Taylor [2009] 2 NZLR 17. As two commercial law academics reported, \\"New Zealand cases subsequent to Trevor Ivory have done little but create uncertainty for litigants. The courts‚Äô approaches have varied widely with some judges applying Trevor Ivory and others making every effort to distinguish it.\\" ==References== Category:Court of Appeal of New Zealand cases Category:1991 in New Zealand law Category:1991 in case law Category:New Zealand tort case law Category:Corporate case law ","title":"Trevor Ivory Ltd v Anderson"},{"id":"46414244","text":"Emily Kai Bock (born 1983 or 1984) is a Canadian writer and film director.

She is greeted by Farhad Yervan, the self- described \\"Mr. Idiot\\" painter who claims to know her since long ago. Goli is repulsed by his advances and the fact that he knows so many things about her, while she is distressed that everyone in the town seems to accuse her of missing out her mother, Hava's funeral five years ago. She later recollects that Farhad knew her since at least college times. Interspersed with her story are flashbacks showing that Farhad had made repeated contacts with Hava, from whom he learned about Goli. Hava held Farhad affectionately and lamented Goli's indifference towards him. Goli begins reconnecting with her old life, including meeting with her college crush, Ali Yaghuti, who is now married with three children, her aunt who lives in Bandar-e Anzali, and tea plantation owner Mr. Najdi, who reveals that he had plans to propose to Hava before he moved overseas. At one point, Goli becomes furious at Farhad due to his repeated advances and lets him get attacked by a mob for harassment, though she later apologizes and invites him to her house. He does so by walking with his head on the streets and carrying a large suitcase; when he arrives, he collapses from dizziness. As Goli calls him, flashbacks reveal that Farhad had in fact known and fallen in love with Goli since they were children. He observed her mannerisms, her fondness, even her habit of drawing X every time she went to the pier, which is later explained as a way for her to remember a lost lyric for a song. After he wakes up, he shows Goli the contents of the suitcase: all things that she used to hold dear. The two stay together until night, when an exhausted Farhad decides to sleep on a table in the living room, with Goli bidding him good night. == Cast == * Leila Hatami as Goli Ebtehaj * Ali Mosaffa as Farhad Yervani * Zari Khoshkam as Hava Mostufi * Ebrahim Zamir as Mr. Najdi * Zeynab Shabani as Arash * Christophe Rezai as Antoine / Monsieur Legrand * Payam Yazdani as Ali Yaghuti * Lili Samii as Khaljan ==Awards== * Winner FIPRESCI Award 19th Busan International Film Festival * Winner GOLD FIFOG for Best Film 10th International Oriental Film Festival of Geneva * Winner Audience Award 5th Iranian Film Festival, Brisbane, Sydney, Canberra, Adelaide, Melbourne, Australia * Winner Crystal Simorgh for Best Screenplay Fajr International Film Festival == References  External links == * * In International Federation of Film Critics * Official Trailer * Official Portal - WHAT‚ÄôS THE TIME IN YOUR WORLD? * In IFFA Festival * In Vilnius International Film Festival * In National Food Security Act * In King's College London Category:Iranian films Category:2014 drama films Category:2014 films Category:Iranian drama films ","title":"What's the Time in Your World?"},{"id":"46414347","text":"Dolen Perkins-Valdez is an American writer, best known for her debut novel Wench: A Novel (2010), which became a bestseller. Based in Washington, DC, she is a member of the PEN/Faulkner Board of Directors. She is an associate professor in creative writing at American University. ==Early life and education== Born Dolen Marie Perkins to Barbara J. Perkins and James A. Perkins of Memphis, Tennessee, she grew up there. She attended Harvard College as an undergraduate, earning a BA degree. She completed a master's in creative writing from the University of Memphis, and a PhD in English at George Washington University in Washington, DC, where she settled as an adult. ==Career== Perkins-Valdez has published short fiction and essays in such magazines as The Kenyon Review, StoryQuarterly, StorySouth, African American Review, PMS: PoemMemoirStory, North Carolina Literary Review, Richard Wright Newsletter, and SLI: Studies in Literary Imagination. She has also taught at Mary Washington College, and the University of Puget Sound. She is now an associate professor at American University in Washington, DC. Perkins-Valdez has said she was inspired to write her debut novel, Wench: A Novel (2010), after reading a biography of W.E.B. Dubois and coming across a brief reference to the founding of Wilberforce University. It was noted as first being based at the buildings and grounds of a former, privately owned resort called Tawawa House, named for the \\"yellow springs\\" in the area. The iron-rich waters were thought to have medicinal value. Among the regular summer visitors to the Ohio resort in the antebellum period were Southern white planters and their enslaved mistresses of color. Wench features Lizzie, a young enslaved woman, and her complicated relationship with her master. It also explores the lives of three other mistresses of color, whom Lizzie comes to know at the resort. They are influenced by spending time in a free state, and seeing free people of color there. It was published by Harper Collins in 2010 and in paperback the following year. The book received positive reviews and notice as a debut novel. The paperback edition became a bestseller. The novel was selected by NPR in 2010 as one of five books published that year that was recommended to book clubs, for \\"something to talk about\\".

It explores a Tennessee black healer named Madge, who was born free; a white widowed spiritualist named Sadie; and a freedman called Hemp from Kentucky, who gained freedom by fighting with the Union Army. Each migrated to Chicago after the war, along with thousands of others working to rebuild their lives and to explore new kinds of freedom. Perkins-Valdez said that she wanted to \\"move the story out of the battlegrounds of the war into a place like Chicago [...] taking it out of those traditional spaces such as the South or even thinking of Virginia or Pennsylvania... and putting it somewhere that was absolutely affected by the war but was still, in some ways, peripheral.\\" ==Honors== * 2002-2003, she was a president's postdoctoral fellow at the Center for African American Studies at the University of California at Los Angeles. * 2009, finalist for the Robert Olen Butler Fiction Award. * 2011, finalist for two NAACP Image Awards and the Hurston-Wright Legacy Award for fiction, for her novel Wench * Perkins-Valdez received the First Novelist Award in 2011 for Wench by the Black Caucus of the American Library Association. * She received a DC Commission on the Arts Grant to aid in completion of her second novel, Balm. ==Bibliography== *Wench: A Novel (2010) *Balm: A Novel (2015) ==References * Category:21st- century American women writers Category:Living people Category:African- American novelists Category:American women novelists Category:American historical novelists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:21st-century American novelists Category:Women historical novelists Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Columbian College of Arts and Sciences alumni Category:Writers from Memphis, Tennessee Category:Novelists from Tennessee Category:University of Memphis alumni Category:University of Mary Washington faculty Category:University of Puget Sound faculty Category:American University faculty and staff ","title":"Dolen Perkins-Valdez"},{"id":"46414362","text":"Big Lovely Mountain is a summit in Knott County, Kentucky, in the United States.

The shock occurred on the Calaveras Fault near Coyote Lake in Santa Clara County, California and resulted in a number of injuries, including some that required hospitalization. Most of the $500,000 in damage that was caused was non- structural, but several businesses were closed for repairs. Data from numerous strong motion instruments was used to determine the type, depth, and extent of slip. A non-destructive aftershock sequence that lasted throughout the remainder of the month was of interest to seismologists, especially with regard to fault creep, and following the event local governments evaluated their response to the incident. ==Tectonic setting== The San Andreas Fault system (SAF) is a network of right-lateral strike-slip faults that form a portion of a complex and diffuse plate boundary. The faults span on and off shore along the California portion of the Pacific Rim, and in the area near San Francisco Bay, the extent of the various fault strands are limited to about wide from east to west. This system of faults terminates in the north at the Mendocino Triple Junction where the north-northwest trending SAF meets the east trending Mendocino Fracture Zone. It terminates in the south in a more gradual fashion at the Salton Sea, where displacement transitions to a series of transform faults and spreading centers along the Gulf of California Rift Zone. Several strands of the SAF in the eastern region of the San Francisco Bay Area are the Hayward‚ÄìRodgers Creek and Calaveras Faults. The Hayward Fault exhibits fault creep, but it also has potential for large earthquakes, like the 1868 Hayward earthquake that occurred on its southern segment. The northern Calaveras Fault meets the Hayward Fault near the Calaveras Reservoir and can also produce large earthquakes. Except for a large shock that occurred in 1911, the central and southern segments might only produce smaller events and fault creep. ==Earthquake== The earthquake occurred on the Calaveras Fault near Coyote Lake in Santa Clara County. Although the Hayward Fault Zone is also nearby, making this an area of regular seismic activity, no observable foreshocks occurred within the preceding three months. The mainshock was felt throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, but damage was mainly limited to the nearby towns of Gilroy and Hollister. A large number of strong motion stations recorded the event, including an array of units along the rupture zone, and instruments at the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory. The two closest stations at Coyote Creek and Gilroy, as well as the Berkeley stations, were used to refine the overall fault length, slip, and depth of faulting. The records revealed that strike-slip motion occurred over on a vertical fault, and that the total amount of slip varied with depth, with more slip occurring in the shallower regions. Damage In Gilroy and Hollister, sixteen people were injured, and damage totaled $500,000. Chimneys fell (especially on older homes in the downtown area of Gilroy) and glass was broken, but in Gilroy, structural damage afflicted five buildings. A wall was cracked at city hall, and a court room ceiling collapsed. Damaged structural components at a Ford's Department Store forced its closure. In Hollister, a J. C. Penney had a hole and cracks in its ceiling and a parapet collapsed at a law office. At Casa de Fruta, a service station sustained structural damage, as did a fire station at Pacheco Pass. USGS ShakeMap for the event An early estimate by the Small Business Administration put total damage in Gilroy at twice the amount of what was seen in Hollister. Ten people were brought to Hazel Hawkins Memorial Hospital in Hollister for treatment of lacerations, a cardiac problem, and anxiety. In Gilroy, the Wheeler Hospital saw six similar cases and a patient with a fractured hip. Most of those that sought care (including four that were transported by ambulance) were treated and released, but six were admitted. Intensity At the most extreme points of its perceptibility, it was felt with intensity II or III (Weak) at Healdsburg in the north and Santa Barbara in the south, Visalia in the central valley and Twain Harte in the Sierra Nevada foothills. It was also listed as having been felt (with no specific intensity level given) by residents in high-rise buildings in Reno, Nevada. Closer to the epicenter, several instances of damage were aligned with the highest observed intensity. The structural effects to the gas station's walls and roof at Casa de Fruta, the beam damage on the second floor of the Ford's department store in Gilroy, and the caved-in roof from the fallen parapet at the law office in Hollister were all considered by the United States Geological Survey to be consistent with intensity VII (Very strong) shaking. Strong motion The event was captured on seismographs at distances of up to , including Richmond, with the unit \\"down hole\\" in bay mud. Other underground instruments on the BART Transbay Tube, as well as the Richmond site, showed accelerations that were very low. In San Juan Bautista, the U.S. Route 101/State Route 156 overpass saw peak acceleration of .12g on the ground and .29g on the structure. Instruments on the gymnasium roof diaphragm at the campus of West Valley College in Saratoga provided records of interest. Of a number of dams that had instruments installed, the San Luis Dam at San Luis Reservoir had the strongest response. The highest acceleration of .44g was seen at the San Ysidro School in Gilroy. Aftershocks The United States Geological Survey operated a network of seismograph stations in the region where the shock occurred since 1969. A survey of the aftershock activity used data from these stations, along with a custom crustal velocity model, to narrow epicenter locations to within several tens of meters. The study indicated that the mainshock and the aftershocks were aligned with the strike and dip of the Calaveras Fault in that area and were classified into three distinct groups. The east-dipping northeastern group, a diffuse middle group, and a shallow and nearly vertical southwestern group showed variations of slip, especially in the 18 months after the mainshock, when fault creep was significantly higher in the northeastern and middle groups. ==Response== While none of the affected counties or cities declared a state of emergency following the event, the Small Business Administration approved a request by the Office of Emergency Services for a disaster declaration in late September. This formality paved the way for low interest loans for commercial or residential properties that suffered damage, but only about 50 claims were expected. Local authorities had trained for disasters on a regular basis, and the response to the light damage was considered smooth, though some officials sought room for improvement. Discussions followed the event, with local governments focusing on telecommunication problems, emergency power systems, and seismic safety. ==See also== * List of earthquakes in California * List of earthquakes in the United States ==References * M5.7 ‚Äì Northern California ‚Äì United States Geological Survey * Category:1979 earthquakes Category:Earthquakes in California Category:History of Santa Clara County, California Category:History of the San Francisco Bay Area Coyote Lake Category:August 1979 events in the United States Category:1979 natural disasters in the United States ","title":"1979 Coyote Lake earthquake"},{"id":"46414494","text":"Janet Lynn Skinner (born July 5, 1955) is an American gospel musician, and she is the present music minister of Destiny Church located in Twinsburg, Ohio.

It is distinguished by its short, thick leaves and small but profuse heads of white or cream flowers. There are three subspecies. ==Description== Melaleuca pauperiflora is a large shrub or small tree growing to a height of about with rough or fibrous grey bark. It leaves vary somewhat with subspecies but in general are long, wide, very narrow elliptical to almost linear in shape and almost circular in cross section. The tips of the leaves are sometimes blunt, sometimes pointed and sometimes sharp. The flowers are white to pale yellow and arranged in hemispherical heads, mostly on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering but sometimes also in the upper leaf axils. The heads are about in diameter and contain 3 to 10 individual flowers. The petals are long and fall off as the flower matures. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle containing 10 to 18 stamens. Flowering occurs in spring and early summer and is followed by fruit which are woody, barrel-shaped capsules more or less scattered along the branches. Hyden ==Taxonomy and naming== Melaleuca pauperiflora was first formally described in 1862 by Ferdinand von Mueller in \\"Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae\\" from a specimen collected by George Maxwell in the Phillips Range. The specific epithet (pauperiflora) is derived from the Latin words pauper meaning ‚Äúpoor‚Äù and flos meaning \\"flower\\" or \\"blossom\\" referring to the specimen described by Mueller which had only a few flowers. In a review of the genus Melaleuca in 1988, Bryan Barlow and Kirsten Cowley described three subspecies of Melaleuca pauperiflora: * Melaleuca pauperiflora subsp. fastigiata occurs in Western Australia between the Wubin, Kulin, Esperance and Norseman districts; * Melaleuca pauperiflora subsp. mutica occurs in South Australia, especially the Eyre Peninsula, in the Nullarbor Plain and as far east as Murray Bridge; * Melaleuca pauperiflora subsp. pauperiflora occurs in Western Australia between the South Yilgarn, Ongerup and Salmon Gums districts. ==Distribution and habitat== Melaleuca pauperiflora occurs in the south-west corner of Western Australia and the south of South Australia. It grows in a range of vegetation associations and soils, depending largely on subspecies. ==Ecology== Jewel beetles (Family Buprestidae), especially Temognatha heros are important pollinators of Melaleuca pauperiflora. ==Conservation== This species is classified as \\"not threatened\\" (in Western Australia) by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. ==Uses== Horticulture Although not of great horticultural value, it is a hardy plant and is useful as a screening plant in dry areas. Essential oils Of the three forms, subspecies mutica has the most oil in the leaves. It consists mostly of monoterpenoids, especially 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol). ==References== Category:Flora of Western Australia pauperiflora Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Plants described in 1862 Category:Taxa named by Ferdinand von Mueller ","title":"Melaleuca pauperiflora"},{"id":"46414501","text":"Scottish military units may refer to: * units in former Scottish armies * Scottish units in former British armies, including: ** The Lowland Brigade ** The Highland Brigage * Scottish units in the present structure of the British Army, including: ** Scottish Division *** Royal Regiment of Scotland **** Royal Highland Fusiliers ==See also== * Scottish units of measurement ","title":"Scottish military units"},{"id":"46414563","text":"Calculus bicolor, the sole species of the genus Calculus, is a South African spider in the family Orsolobidae.

He is best known for writing the best-selling children's picture book The Day the Crayons Quit, and its sequel The Day the Crayons Came Home, both illustrated by Oliver Jeffers. Daywalt is also known for writing scripts for American television and Hollywood studio films, and for creating a number of short horror films for release on the internet. == Early life == Drew Daywalt was born in Hudson, Ohio on January 5, 1970, the youngest of six children, to Charlene (n√©e Bable) and Charles Daywalt. ‚ÄúI grew up in a house in Hudson, Ohio, that was notoriously haunted. It looked like ‚ÄòThe Munsters.‚Äô‚Äù The house had a storied reputation in the local area, having supposedly been a stagecoach stop, a brothel, and a respite on the Underground Railroad at various times. Daywalt‚Äôs older brothers, however unintentionally, fostered his interest in scary stories. He relates, ‚ÄúMy older brothers would always let me stay up way too late on Friday nights, drink Mountain Dew, watch horror movies. I was always getting into their comic books‚Ä¶ Heavy Metal and Creepy and Tales from the Crypt. Also, at the time ‚Äì this is going back to the mid 70s, almost into the early 80s ‚Äì they were reading Tolkien and lot of that, so I had that as one side of my experiences. Growing up in a haunted house, watching horror movies with my older brothers and getting into their stash of horror magazines and comic books.‚Äù During the same period, Daywalt's mother, Charlene, would often come home from work and read to him from the works of well-known children's authors, like Dr. Seuss, Roald Dahl and Maurice Sendak. ‚ÄúI was constantly being inundated by other worlds‚Ä¶,‚Äù said Daywalt. ‚ÄúA lot of what I do, whether it‚Äôs either horror or children‚Äôs lit, comes from that period in my life.‚Äù The author/filmmaker said he first realized that books and movies ‚Äú‚Ä¶were actually written and created by other human beings‚Ä¶‚Äù at the age of 7. ‚ÄúIt was 1977. Summer. And my big sister had taken me to see the first Star Wars film. As the credits rolled at the end, and I sat there trying to catch my breath and fully digest what I‚Äôd seen, I saw the screenplay credit. I knew then that I wanted to tell stories.‚Äù Daywalt's family eventually moved to nearby Stow, Ohio, where he attended Highland Elementary School. After graduating from Stow- Munroe Falls High School in 1988, Daywalt pursued creative writing at Emerson College in Boston. ‚ÄúMy concentrations were in screenwriting and children‚Äôs literature‚Ä¶,‚Äù Daywalt has stated. ‚ÄúBecause at the time, my big plan was: if I really know children‚Äôs literature and the history of fairy tales, and storytelling for kids in a meaningful and deep way, and I also learn screenwriting, I can go and work with Disney. That was my goal, was to get out [to Los Angeles] and work with Disney and Warner Brothers and write children‚Äôs animation for TV and for film.‚Äù ==Career== Filmmaking Daywalt first achieved fame writing and directing short films with the horror filmmaking YouTube channel Fewdio, co-founded by Daywalt in 2007. In a 2009 interview with Dread Central, Daywalt described the origins of Fewdio, saying, \\"We were all a little bit burned out on dealing with studio execs around the time the strike hit. I had been a script writer for 17 years, and I‚Äôd written for and rewritten everyone in town so I was ready for something different. We had done the Axe Body campaign ‚Äì 'How Dirty Boys Get Clean' ‚Äì that pretty much set us up financially so we could get through the strike. That‚Äôs when we decided to do what we loved as children: make horror films. We really wanted to do something for ourselves. I read everything I could about cameras and saved up a thousand bucks, and we shot our first short, 'Cursed.'\\" Daywalt made numerous shorts with Fewdio, and his 2009 horror short \\"Bedfellows\\" won the Chiller-Eyegore Award for Best Short Film. Drew Grant of Salon described Daywalt's work with the group as \\"the first really great horror films for the Internet era.\\" The group disbanded in 2010, however, and Daywalt went on to found his own YouTube channel, Daywalt Fear Factory. In 2012, Daywalt directed his first feature-length film, the made-for-television fantasy horror film Red Clover (released as Leprechaun's Revenge) for SyFy Channel. The film was met with mixed to negative reviews.  Writing Children's Books  = The Day the Crayons Quit = Drew Daywalt's first children's picture book, The Day the Crayons Quit, with illustrations by Oliver Jeffers, was published by Philomel Books on June 27, 2013. The book was a critical and commercial success, earning positive responses from critics and selling over one-and-a- half million copies worldwide. The idea for the book originated with a simple box of crayons on Daywalt's desk, and his affinity for writing dialogue. ‚ÄúI thought, ‚ÄòHere I am, a grown-up ‚Äî it was before I had kids ‚Äî and I have a box of crayons on my desk.‚Äô It was still important enough for me in my life to have a box of crayons around. I didn't exactly know what to write about crayons, but I knew that it was something I wanted to approach. ‚ÄúIn Hollywood I had been a script doctor for years, fixing dialogue on movies. As a writer, one of my strengths is voice, so I thought, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to give these crayons voices‚Ä¶‚Äô I decided I'd write them as monologues in the form of letters, in an epistolary style ‚Äî basically all these crayons would chew this kid out because they didn't like the way they were being used. They were like letters of resignation.‚Äù Since the book‚Äôs original publication in 2013, The Day the Crayons Quit has been almost unrivaled in sales within its genre. In 2015, Entertainment Weekly referred to it as the longest running title to ever appear on The New York Times Best Seller list for children‚Äôs picture books, the book having held the weekly number-one spot on the list for over a year, and a total of 258 weeks on the list as of January 2019. Critical response to the book has been largely positive. For instance, the starred review in Publishers Weekly stated, ‚ÄúMaking a noteworthy debut, Daywalt composes droll missives that express aggravation and aim to persuade,‚Äù while referring to the crayon characters as ‚Äú‚Ä¶memorable personalities [that] will leave readers glancing apprehensively at their own crayon boxes.‚Äù In 2014, Danielle Herzog of The Washington Post joyfully related the experience of reading the book to her own children. ‚ÄúAs I read each letter to my 6 and 3-year-old children,‚Äù she wrote, ‚Äúthey howled with laughter. They loved the argument between the orange and yellow crayon over who gets to be the color of the sun, and they cracked up when the poor white crayon is only used to make pictures of cats and snow‚Ä¶ But the best part came after the book was closed and put away. They rushed to their own crayon boxes, pulled out the same colors we read about, and started to color an array of pictures now gracing our refrigerator door.‚Äù The Day The Crayons Quit has won numerous children's book awards. In the year of its publication, 2013, the book won the Goodreads Choice Award for Best Picture Book, was named Amazon's Best Children's Book, and was named to Time Magazine's list of The 100 Best Children's Books of All Time. Later, the book won the Texas Bluebonnet Award in 2015, having received 29,931 votes from Texas children. Daywalt and Jeffers received the award in person, on April 16, 2015 at the Texas Bluebonnet Award Luncheon. The book also won the 2015 Nevada Young Readers Award and the 2016 California Young Reader Medal. In late July 2014, the film rights for The Day the Crayons Quit were purchased by Universal Studios, with Matt Lopez set to script and Madhouse Entertainment set to produce. = Other Children‚Äôs Books = In October 2014, Daywalt announced a sequel to the book titled The Day the Crayons Came Home. It was published by Philomel Books on August 18, 2015, with illustrations once again by Oliver Jeffers. The book garnered critical acclaim and similarly enthusiastic sales, remaining on The New York Times Best Seller list for children's picture books for over 40 weeks. In 2017, Daywalt wrote another picture book The Legend of Rock Paper Scissors, illustrated by Adam Rex. == Bibliography == *The Day the Crayons Quit, illustrated by Oliver Jeffers ‚Äì Philomel Books, June 27, 2013 ‚Äì *The Day the Crayons Came Home, illustrated by Oliver Jeffers ‚Äì Philomel Books, August 18, 2015 ‚Äì *The Legend of Rock Paper Scissors, illustrated by Adam Rex ‚Äì Harper Collins/Balzer + Bray, April 4, 2017 ‚Äì *Star Wars: BB-8 On the Run, illustrated by Matt Myers ‚Äì Disney Lucasfilm Press, September 1, 2017 ‚Äì *Sleepy, the Goodnight Buddy, illustrated by Scott Campbell ‚Äì Disney- Hyperion, September 11, 2018 ‚Äì *The Epic Adventures of Huggie & Stick, illustrated by David Spencer ‚Äì Philomel Books, November 6, 2018 ‚Äì ==References * *Official website Category:American film directors Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:American male writers Category:American children's writers Category:American horror writers ","title":"Drew Daywalt"},{"id":"46414597","text":"The Varian Rule holds that \\"A simple way to forecast the future is to look at what rich people have today; middle-income people will have something equivalent in 10 years, and poor people will have it in an additional decade.\\" It is attributed to Google‚Äôs chief economist Hal Varian.

Named in honour of Emily Collins. Gardenology.org Elian Emily Collins (n√©e Pemberton 4 September 1858 - c.1945) was an English botanist, naturalist and an early collector of plant specimens in Thailand. She discovered several plant species new to science and had numerous species named after her. ==Biography== Early life Collins was born in Myanmar (Burma) on 4 September 1858. She married David John Collins, a surveyor, and travelled with him to Thailand in 1877. Collecting work Collins was an early collector of plant specimens in Thailand. She collected plants mainly in the regions of Chonburi (Si Racha) and Chanthaburi between 1902 and 1938. She was encouraged in her collecting efforts by Dr Arthur Francis George Kerr whom she met in Si Racha in September 1911. Collins frequently sent Dr Kerr specimens which were incorporated into his private herbarium. These specimens are now held at the Natural History Museum, London. Collins also sent specimens to other botanists as well as to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. She corresponded with Professor William Grant Craib, Regius Professor of Botany at Aberdeen University and author of Florae Siamensis Enumeratio. Collins was recognised by him as one of two important collectors who supplied specimens to the Royal Botanical Gardens herbarium from the Si Racha area in Thailand. The other collector being Dr Kerr. Collins corresponded with Sir Arthur William Hill, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. As well as providing specimens, she sent photographs and information on common names and economic uses of local plants she collected and supplied Kew. She also corresponded with Sir David Prain and through him provided Trinity College, Dublin with specimens. Her specimens are held in Herbaria around the world including in the Department of Agriculture Herbarium (BK), Bangkok, Harvard University Herbarium, The Natural History Museum, Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, Missouri Botanical Garden Herbarium, New York Botanical Garden Herbarium and the United States National Herbarium. After Collins stopped collecting in 1938 very few botanists appeared to collect systematically in this area of Thailand until the mid 1970s. Collins was among the first members of The Natural History Society of Siam when it was established on 6 March 1914. This organisation became a section of the Siam Society in 1925. Collins was instrumental in releasing the mosquito eating fish Gamusia into Thailand waters in January 1929. Awards Collins was made a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the King's Birthday Honours List of 1938. Emily Collins at her home in Bangkok, wearing her MBE award. The house was bequeathed to the British Government and became for a while the British Embassy. Species named in Collins' honour Several plant species have the descriptive term \\"collinsae\\" or \\"collinsiae\\" in their name in her honour. These include * Actephila collinsiae * Ardisia collinsae * Lagerstroemia collinsae * Rivea collinsae * Eugenia collinsae * Stemona collinsiae * Tarenna collinsae * Mitrephora collinsae * Zanthoxylum collinsae * Argyreia collinsae * Phyllanthus collinsiae Death She continued to reside in Thailand until her death sometime after World War II. ==References== Category:Women botanists Category:English botanists Category:1858 births Category:1945 deaths Category:English expatriates in Thailand ","title":"Emily Collins (botanist)"},{"id":"46414627","text":"Seapatrick () is a civil parish in County Down, Northern Ireland.

The book asserts that the countercultural themes in the ministry of Jesus, such as those of self-denial, are ignored by American Christians because they have become accustomed to exercising Christian privilege and are unwilling to give it up. Jesus for President received generally positive reviews from critics in both secular and Christian media. David Swanson wrote a three-part review of Jesus for President in Christianity Today, in which he argues that \\"Claiborne and Haw make a compelling case that the church in America has become much too cozy with the state\\". Mark Tooley of the Institute on Religion and Democracy was heavily critical of the book, calling the book's pacifism both utopian and anti- American. ==Background== Jesus for President was first published in March 2008 and had sold more than 300,000 copies by that December. Claiborne and Haw first met in the 2000s, when they were both living in different Christian intentional communities in the United States. Claiborne wrote The Irresistible Revolution: Living as an Ordinary Radical, his debut book, in 2006. Haw was a theology graduate student at Villanova University when Jesus for President was released. Claiborne said that the title of the book is not to be taken literally, and that \\"Jesus' political manifesto is a terrible plan for running a superpower\\". Jesus for President became a bestseller. All proceeds from sales of the book went towards the Jubilee Fund, a nonprofit organization founded by Claiborne and others in support of international community projects. An audiobook edition of Jesus for President was released in 2009. ==Content== Jesus for President is structured as a series of loosely interrelated narratives. The book combines practical theology, biblical theology, ecclesiastical history, contemporary stories, political manifesto, and Bible stories. The book draws on both the Old and New Testaments, and includes frequent quotations from Church Fathers, such as Justin Martyr and Tertullian. The book is intended to present an accessible account of scholarly findings regarding the New Testament's teachings on the subject of empire. Likening Jesus to an American political candidate, Jesus for President identifies Luke 4:18‚Äì19 as the commencement speech of Jesus' campaign, \\"Jubilee\\" as his campaign slogan, and the revival of ancient Jubilee economics as his platform. The book asserts that the countercultural themes in the ministry of Jesus, such as those of self-denial, are ignored by the church because the Church is more interested in conforming its members to the state than to the Kingdom of God. The book warns against the lures of political and financial power. While the book suggests that Christians should live counterculturally in accordance with Jesus' teachings, the authors do not prescribe how Christians should accomplish this task. Neither do they advocate restructuring the economic or political systems of the United States. The book promotes pacifism, criticizes the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and expounds liberation theology. Jesus for President is divided into four chapters, the first two of which summarize the Bible from a New Monastic perspective. The summary of the Old Testament argues that the Israelites had a unique political philosophy, but that they failed to live up to its implications. The New Testament summary considers Jesus' politics and the qualities of the Christian Church. The third chapter suggests implications of this narrative for citizens of the United States, who the authors describe as members of an empire similar to that of the Romans. This chapter argues that the Book of Revelation has more to do with living faithfully in an evil empire than with eschatology. The chapter also asserts that Constantinianism had generally negative consequences for the Church. The fourth chapter tells of Christians living in countercultural ways that model divine redemption towards others. Other stories involve heterodox economics, defending the homeless, Amish forgiveness, dumpster diving, missional robotics, Martin Luther King Jr., anti-war protests, and The Simple Way. ==Tour== Claiborne and Haw promoted Jesus for President by going on a U.S. speaking tour of 30 cities. The tour led up to the 2008 United States presidential election, and the book tour was suggestive of a third party candidate campaign for Jesus. The authors' speeches did not attempt to sway their audiences towards or away from any particular candidates, but rather encouraged them to endorse whichever candidates supported Christian values. CNN's senior political analyst Bill Schneider predicted that Claiborne's and Haw's \\"impact is likely to be that they will dilute the Evangelical support for the Republican Party and the Evangelical vote will be more up for grabs than it has in many years\\". After reading and being impressed by Jesus for President, Ben Cohen of the ice cream company Ben & Jerry's met with Claiborne. They decided to launch a variety show in September 2011 called Jesus, Bombs, & Ice Cream. Coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, the show called for the military budget of the United States to be decreased. ==Reception== Secular media Publishers Weekly called Jesus for President \\"the must-read election-year book for Christian Americans\\" and an \\"entertaining yet provocative tour of the Bible's social and economic order [that] makes even the most abstruse Levitical laws come alive for our era.\\" In a Library Journal review, George Westerlund recommends that large libraries purchase Jesus for President, writing that the book is a good read even for readers who theologically or philosophically differ from Claiborne and Haw. Susan Campbell wrote about the book and the tour in the Hartford Courant, calling the book \\"bare-knuckle\\" and \\"deceptively deep\\". Christian media British Baptist minister Steve Chalke called it \\"a radical manifesto to awaken the Christian political imagination [to] what the Church could look like if it placed its faith in Jesus instead of Caesar.\\"Chalke (2009), n.p. Chalke argues that the book transcends questions of voting and explores more fundamental issues, such as allegiance and faith. American activist David Swanson wrote a three-part review of Jesus for President in Christianity Today, in which he writes that the popularity of the book is due to its \\"prophetic zeal and prankster's wit\\". Swanson argues that \\"Claiborne and Haw make a compelling case that the church in America has become much too cozy with the state\\", a case that Swanson finds to align with his own personal observations. While agreeing that the gospel should take precedence over secular affairs, Jordan Hylden of Christianity Today writes that Claiborne and Haw advocate for too great a withdrawal from secular politics. Hylden writes that he favors the arguments of Paul the Apostle and Martin Luther, who Hylden claims all reason that Christians should engage with government because God works through such institutions providentially. Joan Braune of America, a Jesuit magazine, writes that Jesus for President implicitly supports Christian anarchism. In December 2008, Mark Tooley, then director of the Institute on Religion and Democracy's United Methodist committee, wrote an opinion piece about Jesus for President in the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard. Tooley is heavily critical of the book and of Claiborne, writing, \\"On so many different levels, Claiborne lacks moral and spiritual perspective.\\" Tooley argues that Jesus for President is selective in its quotations from Church Fathers and instead relies heavily on the teachings of heterodox theologians, naming specifically Walter Brueggemann, John Dominic Crossan, and Walter Wink, people that Tooley writes would not \\"inspire confidence in orthodox Christians.\\" While praising Claiborne's story of nonviolence in response to personally being trapped with a friend in an alley by criminals who hit them with sticks, Tooley criticizes Claiborne for not explaining what he would have done in the case of encountering a pregnant woman who was being similarly treated. Christopher Hitchens, an Anglo-American antitheist, wrote an article in the British tabloid newspaper the Sunday Express in response to Tooley's review. He calls Jesus for President \\"a terrible-sounding book\\" and Claiborne \\"a terrible- sounding person.\\" Hitchens argues that Claiborne and Tooley are attempting to justify their own views by ascribing them to Jesus, with Claiborne arguing that a Jesus would have supported liberation theology and Tooley arguing that Jesus would have supported neoconservatism. In 2012, David P. Gushee, director of Mercer University's Center for Theology and Public Life, named Jesus for President one of the five best books about patriotism, the others being Bonhoeffer's Ethics; Bruce Lincoln's Religion, Empire and Torture; Reinhold Niebuhr's Moral Man and Immoral Society; and A Testament of Hope, a collection of Martin Luther King Jr.'s speeches and writings. ==References== Category:2008 non-fiction books Category:American political books Category:Books about imperialism Category:Christianity and environmentalism Category:Christianity and politics in the United States Category:Christian monasticism Category:Christian pacifism Category:Christian theology and politics Category:Christian theology books Category:English-language books Category:Literary collaborations Category:New Testament theology ","title":"Jesus for President"},{"id":"46414712","text":"John Wilson Cutler (May 12, 1887 ‚Äì March 18, 1950) was an American college football player. ==Early life== Cutler was born on May 12, 1887 in Bangor, Maine.

PNG Hunters In their d√©but season in the Queensland Cup, a second tier competition in Australia, PNG Hunters selected Lo among other emerging players. He impressed the rugby league fans in Queensland, Australia and Papua New Guinea with his speed and power on the flanks and was dubbed as a try-scoring machine and 'mini Matt Utai'. In 2014, he was awarded the top try scorer award in the Queensland Cup for his season's total of 24 tries. During the 2014 off-season, Garry left for Gateshead Thunder in England with his club-mate Jason Tali and Mark Mexico joining from NRL club Cronulla Sharks, which made the headlines in the local news. A controversial signing in which Stanley Gene was criticized for player grabbing. But in a twist, he left England and came back to Papua New Guinea and apologized to the Hunters team for the wrong decision he made to leave them. However, the PNG Hunters made it very clear that there would be no fast return for the Kumuls winger, as he seeks to rejoin the team for the 2015 Queensland Cup Lo then announced that he would join his original club, Mount Hagen Eagles in the Digicel Cup in 2015, where he was appointed captain. Just before the Digicel Cup kick off, PNG Hunters Coach, Michael Marum, named Garry Lo in round 6 in an extended 21 player team to take on the inform Mackay Cutters, after poor performance and injuries to strike players for PNG Hunters. Sheffield Eagles Lo then brought his career back to England by joining Championship side Sheffield Eagles, again along with fellow countryman Mark Mexico. Here he became noticed for pitch-length runs, often resulting in a try. He scored more tries than games played with a 46/50 games/tries record. This resulted in 200 points scored for the Eagles in just two seasons. Castleford Tigers Lo signed a two-year deal with Super League side Castleford Tigers on 22 September 2017 with a deal with the Sheffield Eagles that is on loan. This gives both clubs the option of playing him when he doesn't play for his parent club. The Papua New Guinean scored on his Super League debut in a 28‚Äì12 defeat by Wigan. International career Garry Lo has played five times for Papua New Guinea, scoring four tries so far. He was named in the Papua New Guinea national team for the 2017 World Cup after an impressive season in England.

The brainchild of used-car salesman Glen Gordon \\"Gary\\" Davis, it was largely based upon \\"The Californian\\", a custom three- wheeled roadster built by future Indianapolis 500 racing car designer Frank Kurtis for Southern Californian millionaire and racer Joel Thorne. After building two prototypes in 1947, Davis embarked on an aggressive publicity and promotional campaign for the car, which included numerous magazine appearances, a lavish public unveiling at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, and a promotional trip across the United States. At the company factory in Van Nuys, employees worked frantically to build Divans, although the model was never put into mass production. Despite raising $1.2 million through the sale of 350 dealerships, the Davis Motorcar Company failed to deliver cars to its prospective dealers or pay its employees promptly, and was ultimately sued by both groups. The company's assets were liquidated in order to pay back taxes, while Gary Davis himself was eventually convicted of fraud and grand theft and sentenced to two years at a \\"work farm\\" labor camp. Only 13 Divans (including the two prototypes) were ever built, of which 12 have survived. The car featured aircraft-inspired styling details as well as disc brakes, hidden headlights, and built-in jacks. == Background == The Davis Divan was the brainchild of Glen Gordon \\"Gary\\" Davis, a used-car salesman from Indiana. Its immediate predecessor was a custom three-wheeled roadster called \\"The Californian\\", which had been built in 1941 by future Indianapolis 500 racing car designer Frank Kurtis for Southern Californian millionaire and racer Joel Thorne, who was the heir to the Chase bank fortune. For the single front wheel of \\"The Californian\\", Kurtis had taken inspiration from the Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter aircraft, while he also fitted the vehicle with a Ford V8/60 engine and rear axle. In 1945, shortly after moving to Southern California, Davis purchased the car from Thorne. He paid just $50 for it, and while reports about the circumstances of the sale vary, one suggests that Davis may have deliberately crashed the accident-prone vehicle during a test drive to reduce its value to Thorne. == Development == 1948 Davis Divan on display at the Lane Motor Museum in 2009  Models and prototypes  After purchasing \\"The Californian\\", Davis intended to reverse engineer it with a group of newly hired engineers, including Peter Westburg from Douglas Aircraft Company. Together they built a 1/4th-scale model of the car, which they then photographed for a Hollywood Citizen-News story on July 22, 1947, in which they claimed their ability to build 50 of the cars a day and sell each for $995. Later that year, Davis secured an investment of $2,500 from the Bendix family, which enabled him to create Davis Motorcar Company; ever conscious of his and his project's image, he borrowed local designer Raymond Loewy's office to make his successful pitch. In 1947, Davis built two prototypes of what was intended to be an economy car, first the Davis D-1 (nicknamed \\"Baby\\") and then the D-2 (\\"Delta\\"), the latter of which featured a removable hardtop. While testing \\"Baby\\", Davis was able to achieve tire marks with a circumference of just , demonstrating the vehicle's impressive turning radius.  Publicity and promotion  Rear view of a Davis Divan Looking to capitalize on the booming post-World War II American car market, Davis obtained significant coverage for his new car in prominent magazines such as Business Week, Life, and Parade as well as in a period newsreel and a syndicated television crime drama, The Cases of Eddie Drake. In November 1947, the Davis Divan was publicly unveiled at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles; assisting Davis in handling the event were Jack Adams, a former reporter at The Los Angeles Herald-Express who had been hired to manage public relations for the fledgling company, and Cleo Moore, an actress who had been hired to pose with the \\"Baby\\" prototype as a promotional model as well as mingle with the press at the hotel. Also during the event, Davis had four American Airlines stewardesses hired for the occasion sit side by side across the car's single bench seat to demonstrate its ability to carry four adults. Due partially to the tantalizing pitch for a $1,000 automobile that Davis made, and partially to the positive publicity from the Divan's public unveiling, sales of Davis dealerships increased substantially, which allowed the company to finance a promotional trip across the United States. In the words of Bob Golfen, Davis touted the Divan as \\"the ultimate car of the future\\". For additional promotion, \\"Baby\\" was repainted and put on display in a Philadelphia department store for the holiday shopping season, after which it was repainted once more in preparation for participating in Pasadena's Rose Parade before the 1948 Rose Bowl.  Pre-production  At the factory in Van Nuys, the pace of development became frantic, with workers occasionally staying 72 hours at a time and sleeping in a nearby house that Davis had rented. Busy with promoting the Divan, Davis delegated production duties to newly hired Bob \\"Pinky\\" Howells. Howells worked feverishly to meet Davis' deadlines, which called for prospective dealers to receive their cars within just 90 days; he ordered a drop hammer press, two gas furnaces, and a set of kirksite dies from a Pasadena tool-and-die maker. However, when he demonstrated his progress to his boss, Davis fired Howells because, as his colleague Westburg put it, \\"he had spent $45,000 of company money ... on production.\\" At the time, Davis was paying himself a monthly salary of $1,000, and the Davis Motorcar Company had already raised $1.2 million through the sale of 350 dealerships.  Demise  Increasingly concerned investors began demanding a return on their investments, and as they became less satisfied with Davis' claims, they began arriving at the company's factory unannounced to press the engineers for accurate delivery dates. In early 1949, prospective dealers sued Davis for breach of contract; company employees followed suit in May 1949, as many of them had not been paid for their work after taking an offer from Davis that promised them double pay after production began if they worked for free during the pre-production phase. After a Los Angeles County District Attorney investigation, Davis was convicted on 20 counts of fraud and eight counts of grand theft by a jury in 1951. While the Davis Motorcar Company's assets were liquidated in order to pay back taxes, Davis himself claimed that he could not repay his debts and was instead sentenced to two years at a \\"work farm\\" labor camp in Castaic, California. == Specifications == Interior view of a Davis Divan Between 1947 and 1949, the Davis Motorcar Company produced a total of 16 running vehicles, including 11 pre-production Divans as well as the two prototypes and three military vehicles, which were comparable to Willys Jeeps. All of the Davis models had a single wheel in the front and two wheels at the back of the vehicle. The cars were built in a hangar at Van Nuys Airport that was previously used for aircraft assembly and later acquired by Petersen Aviation. The Davis Divan measured in length with a wheelbase of , which was remarkably long for a three-wheeled vehicle; it had a height of and weighed . With a width of , it was wide enough to seat four passengers abreast on its single bench seat; in fact, this feature had inspired the name of the car, which was the Arabic term for a couch or day bed. The car also featured a removable fiberglass top along with a steel chassis and chrome-trimmed aluminum body, which sported aircraft-inspired styling details, wheels, disc brakes, and hidden headlights. The Divan was built with a channel steel frame and 11 body panels made of aluminum and zinc, while the \\"Baby\\" prototype had instead been constructed with a tube steel space frame. The finished car boasted jacks built into each of its corners, which allowed for easier tire changing. Most of the Divans were powered by , inline-four Continental engines capable of producing . Others, including both the D-1 \\"Baby\\" and D-2 \\"Delta\\" prototypes, were instead fitted with , four-cylinder Hercules industrial engines. The car's drivetrain included a three-speed Borg-Warner manual transmission as well as a Spicer differential. Claims for the Divan's top speed ranged from to , and its fuel economy was estimated to be between and . The car's three- wheeled design resulted in less tire wear while also making it more maneuverable and fairly easy to park, and Davis claimed that it could successfully make a U-turn at . Scheduled to retail for $1,600 each, the Divans were never put into mass production or sold to the public before the Davis Motorcar Company's demise, and the cars that had already been built were instead given to creditors. == Legacy == 1948 Davis Divan on display at the Petersen Automotive Museum in 2009 While Davis himself was ultimately convicted of fraud, he maintained his innocence throughout his life. He dabbled with numerous other projects and ventures, perhaps the most notable of which was creating Dodge 'Em bumper cars, which then became popular amusement park attractions. Later, he tried to adopt the Dodge 'Em's wraparound bumpers into a design for a safer three-wheeled road car before he retired to Palm Springs and finally died from emphysema in 1973. His vehicles would occasionally make appearances in popular media, including in the Zippy the Pinhead comic strip and the Discovery Channel television program Chasing Classic Cars. As of 2005, 12 of the 13 Davis Divans (including the two prototypes) have been confirmed to have survived, with the exception having been destroyed in the United Kingdom due to British customs laws; there are survivors owned by museums, collectors, and no one at all, while their conditions vary widely. The three Davis military vehicles were tested by the United States Army at its Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland but ultimately not purchased, although all three of them are believed to have survived. After discovering an abandoned Divan in 1967, Tom Wilson of Ypsilanti, Michigan founded the Davis Registry in 1993 to identify and locate surviving Davis vehicles. 1948 Divans are owned and displayed by both the Lane Motor Museum and the Petersen Automotive Museum, the latter of which was featured in an exhibition entitled \\"What Were They Thinking? The Misfits of Motordom\\". In April 2015, the Petersen Automotive Museum launched a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo for restoring its Divan, setting a goal of $30,000 to cover the projected costs of mechanical and body work on the car as well as repainting it a period-correct color. The crowdfunding project was intended to raise awareness about the Divan as well as to fund the restoration project. Before being acquired by the Petersen, this individual car spent many years mounted on a pole outside a Colorado body shop. According to the museum, the Divan's engine and suspension required complete rebuilding while the interior of the car was also in need of replacement.

He was born in Washington, Connecticut. He graduated from Yale College in 1814. He pursued a course of theological study in Maryland, where he resided four years, and was ordained by Bishop Clagett, deacon and priest in the Protestant Episcopal Church. In 1818 he was chosen rector of Christ Church, Hartford, Connecticut, and for over twelve years he discharged with marked efficiency the duties of that post. He resigned the rectorship in 1831 to become the second President of Trinity College, then called Washington College, succeeding Bishop Thomas Church Brownell. For this office he was highly qualified by his ability and learning. He had been one of the most efficient of the founders of the Institution, and while he was President he raised forty thousand dollars for its maintenance. In 1837 he resigned the Presidency to accept the Rectorship of Christ Church, New Orleans, where he labored with fidelity seven years. During the ravages of the yellow fever, he was incessant in his devotion to the sick and dying. In 1823-4, he visited Europe, and wrote upon his return, a volume entitled Journal of a Residence in London, and of Tours in England, Scotland and France, (Hartford, 12mo. 1830.) He also published an expository volume, and occasional discourses. In 1844 he went abroad again. After his second return he divided his time between Washington, his native place, and Hartford, his early home, preaching occasionally, but assuming no special pastoral charge. He bequeathed to the institution over which he presided, the sum of twenty thousand dollars. He was never married. The degree of D. D. was conferred upon him by Yale College in 1833.

It was established by Herjolf Bardsson in the late 10th century and is believed to have lasted some 500 years. The fate of its inhabitants, along with all the other Norse Greenlanders, is unknown. The site is known today for having yielded remarkably well-preserved medieval garments, excavated by Danish archaeologist Paul Norland in 1921. Its name roughly translates as Herjolf's Point or Cape. == Establishment == As noted in the Landn√°mab√≥k (Icelandic Book of Settlements), Herjolf Bardsson was one of the founding chieftains of the Norse colony in Greenland, and was said to be \\"a man of considerable stature.\\"The Greenlanders Saga He was part of an exodus from Iceland accompanying Erik the Red, who led an expedition of colonists in 25 ships in AD 985. Landing on Greenland's southwest coast, Erik and his other kinsmen almost invariably chose to settle further inland away from the open Labrador Sea, at the heads of the fjords where the land was better suited to farming. By contrast, Herjolf's decision to establish himself at the end of a fjord directly facing the open ocean near Greenland's southernmost tip suggests that his primary intention was not farming, but rather the establishment of the new colony's major port of call for incoming ships from Iceland and Europe.Farley Mowat, Westviking (Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1965), pg. 84-5 Herjolf's homestead was situated on the west shore of a fjord that came to bear his name, Herjolfsfjord, and was the southern- and easternmost major homestead of the colony's Eastern Settlement. The major homesteads and churches of the Norse Greenlanders' Eastern Settlement, which despite its name was on Greenland's west coast. Herjolfsnes is the southernmost site. According to The Greenlanders Saga, Herjolfsnes played a significant role in the Norse discovery of North America. Herjolf's son Bjarni had been conducting business in Norway and returned to Iceland to spend Yule at the family's homestead, only to learn Herjolf had joined the exodus to the new Greenland colony. Bjarni set out to follow Herjolf, but was blown off course to the southwest, becoming the first known European to skirt, if not land on, the North American coast. Realizing he had overshot Greenland, Bjarni reversed course to the northeast and came to a land that matched the description he had been given. The saga states, \\"...they landed in the evening under a ness; and there was a boat by the ness, and just here lived Bjarni's father, and from him has the ness taken its name, and is since called Herjolfsness.\\"The Greenlanders Saga The saga then relates how Bjarni travelled to Norway and made his discovery known to the court of Erik Jarl. Erik is said to have treated him well, but others in the court criticized Bjarni's lack of initiative for failing to explore the new lands he had seen. Upon Bjarni's return to Herjolfsnes, he is said to have given up seafaring and lived there with his father, and upon Herjolf's death \\"afterwards dwelt there\\" presumably as the chieftain of the homestead and the immediate district. In Erik The Red's Saga (which covers essentially the same events as the Greenlanders Saga), the famous Icelander Gudrid Thorbjornsdottir is said to have landed at Herjolfsnes after a difficult journey, and lived there for a while. Curiously, this saga describes the homestead as being owned by a man named Thorkell, and makes no mention of Herjolf or Bjarni. Helge and Anne Stine Ingstad believed that the saga's author may have written the two men out of the story in order to elevate the exploits of Leif Eriksson, the first known European to land in North America.Helge & Anne Stine Ingstad, The Viking Discovery of America (St. John's: Breakwater, 2000) pg. 71 By contrast, in The Greenlanders Saga, Leif is said to have prepared for his voyage to Vinland by purchasing Bjarni's ship, during which he presumably received counsel and directions from Bjarni. Ruins of the herjolfsnes church, looking northwest After the colony's conversion to Christianity in AD 1000, Herjolfsnes was one of 16 known sites in the Eastern Settlement on which a church was raised. The ruins that are visible today are those of a church built in the 13th century, which was likely raised on the site of an older, conversion-era church. It had a rectangular foundation similar to that of the churches at Hvalsey and Brattahlid further north in a style that was common in medieval northern Europe. The Herjolfsnes church was the 3rd largest in the Norse Greenland colony, behind Gardar and Brattahlid.Helge Ingstad, Land Under the Pole Star (New York: St. Martin's, 1966), pg. 254 Gardar was the seat of Norse Greenland's bishopric and also the seat of its Althing parliament, while Brattahlid was the most prominent single homestead due to its association with Erik The Red and his descendants, so Herjolfsnes' comparably sized church is an indication of the homestead's relative importance and stature among the Norse Greenland settlements. The church's graveyard contained the remains of local inhabitants and also of those who had died during ocean voyages to the colony. One account tells of 12th century Icelanders who were shipwrecked on the east coast and perished while trying to cross the inland glaciers in an attempt to reach Herjolfsnes, only to be buried there instead. For bodies lost or buried at sea, it appears to have been the custom to carve commemorative runes onto a stick which was then placed in the Herjolfsnes graveyard when the ship made landfall there. One such runestick found at Herjolfsnes reads, \\"This woman, whose name was Gudveg, was laid overboard in the Greenland Sea.\\"Niels Lynnerup, \\"The Greenland Norse,\\" Monographs on Greenland no. 24 (1998): pg. 54 Gudveg's runestick Some of the deceased at Herjolfsnes had been laid to rest in wooden coffins. However, perhaps owing to the scarcity of wood, it increasingly became the practice to wrap the deceased in layers of wool clothing.Else √òsterg√•rd, Woven Into The Earth (Aarhus: Aarhus U Press, 2004) pg. 22 This practice inadvertently created a treasure trove of medieval textile and fashion artifacts when the graves and well-preserved clothes were excavated in the early 20th century. == Later history == Ivar Bardarson, a Norwegian priest who lived in the colony for nearly 20 years in the mid 14th century as a representative of the Norwegian Crown and the Catholic church, wrote that Herjolfsnes served as the major harbour for Greenland's inbound and outbound traffic and was well known to North Atlantic sailors, who referred to it as \\"Sand\\".Land Under the Pole Star, pg. 254 It is not clear if the harbour was in the immediate area of the church and homestead. The nearby Makkarneq Bay, which offers much better shelter than Herjolfsnes proper, features several Norse ruins that appear to include the foundations of stone warehouses, and is thus a possible site of the Sand harbour that Bardarson described.Jette Arneborg, Saga Trails - Four chieftain‚Äôs farmsteads in the Norse settlement of Greenland (The National Museum of Denmark) pg. 75 Herjolfsnes is the only Greenland settlement shown on the Sk√°lholt Map from the late Middle Ages, which shows the North Atlantic's European and North American coastlines as perceived by Norse explorers.A copy of Sigurd Stef√°nsson's 1570 Sk√°lholt Map, correctly showing Herjolfsnes near Cape Farewell. == Contact with other peoples == Prior to the arrival of the Norse, successive waves of Paleo-Eskimo cultures had inhabited Greenland, perhaps as far back as 2500 BC. However, the island is believed to have been uninhabited by the time of the Norse arrival, except perhaps for the extreme northwest region, by the Dorset culture. The Little Climatic Optimum then under way would have made the southwest coast especially unsuited to the Dorset's arctic hunter-gatherer way of life; they are believed to have had great difficulty adapting to this warm period, and retreated progressively farther north. As a result, it is believed that the first North American aboriginals that Norse Greenlanders encountered were actually the Beothuk in Newfoundland. It was only later that the Norse came into direct contact with related peoples in Greenland itself, the Thule culture, who supplanted the Dorset throughout the North American Arctic starting circa AD 1000. These contacts likely started when the Norse began to make regular hunting trips far north of their settlements - or to the island's east coast - to obtain walrus and narwhal ivory. With the advent of the Little Ice Age, Greenland's cooling climate prompted the Thule to increase their southern range, and brought them into greater contact with the Norse than had been the case with the Dorset. Modern Inuit Greenlanders have oral histories about their ancestors' contact with the Norse, which recount instances of both friendship and hostilities. One legend tells of a Norse chieftain named Ungortoq and his enemy, an Inuit leader named K'aissape who was said to have burned the Hvalsey settlement and pursued Ungortoq from Hvalseyfjord all the way down past Herjolfsnes to Cape Farewell. Recent archaeological soil testing of Norse and Thule building ruins in Makkarneq Bay a few kilometres west of Herjolfsnes suggests that both peoples occupied the area at the same time.Kirsty A. Golding A & Ian A. Simpson, The historical legacy of Anthrosols at Sandhavn (Stirling: University of Stirling, 2010) pg. 22 This may be evidence that the Thule were active participants in the Herjolfsnes ivory trade during the Norse period. == Disappearance == Having endured for nearly a half-millennium, the exact fate of the Norse settlers in Herjolfsnes and the entirety of Greenland remains unknown, although several factors were likely involved. The Greenlanders' pastoral way of life would have been severely challenged by the onset of the Little Ice Age, much more so than their counterparts in Europe. DNA analysis of human remains from Herjolfsnes and other settlements shows that marine-based protein (especially from seals) became an increasingly large part of their diet, compared to the pastoral diet of Erik the Red's time. Other theories include the possibility of conflict with Thule Inuit and predation by European pirates. There is no indication from archaeology or human remains that the Norse intermarried with the Thule or adopted their way of life, nor any record from Iceland or Norway that hints of an exodus out of Greenland. Historical records do suggest that ships from Europe arrived less frequently owing to the worsening sea conditions. The traditional Norse route to reach Greenland was to sail due west from Iceland‚Äôs Sn√¶fellsnes peninsula until reaching eastern Greenland‚Äôs Ammassalik district, then sailing south along the coast to reach the settlements on the other side of Cape Farewell. However, by the mid-1300‚Äôs, Ivar Bardarson noted that the quantity of ice from the northeast was such that \\"no one sails this old route without putting their life in danger.\\"Elaine Barrow & Mike Hulme, Climates of the British Isles: Present, Past and Future (London: Routledge, 1997) pg. 129 The Norwegian Crown in Oslo and Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros eventually abandoned the colony to its own devices, although some Popes were aware of the situation. By 1448, Pope Nicholas V lamented reports that Greenland (\\"a region situated at the uttermost end of the earth\\") had been without a resident Bishop for 30 years (although the last known one, Bishop Alf, actually died earlier, in 1378). These concerns were echoed in a letter dated circa 1500 by Pope Alexander VI, who believed that no communion had been performed in Greenland for a century, and that no ship had visited there in the past 80 years. However, even after the colony was forsaken by the Church and well into the 16th century, the empty title \\"Bishop of Gardar\\" continued to be held by a succession of at least 18 individuals, none of whom visited their nominal diocese and only one of whom (Bishop Mattias Knutsson) reportedly expressed any desire to do so.Laurence Larson, \\"The Church In North America\\" Catholic Historical Review Vol. 5, No. 2/3, (1919) pg. 193. Although there is no first-hand account of Norse Greenlanders living after 1410, analysis of the clothing buried at Herjolfsnes suggests that there was a remnant population who continued to have some sort of contact with the outside world for at least a few more decades. One pathos-laden account comes from a sailor dubbed Jon The Greenlander, not from origin of birth, but because \\"...he had drifted to Greenland no fewer than three times...Once when he was sailing with some German merchants from Hamburg, they entered a deep still Greenland fjord...upon going ashore they saw boat-houses, fish-sheds and stone houses for the drying of fish such as are in Iceland...There they found a dead man lying face downwards. On his head was a well-sewn cap. The rest of his garments were partly of wadmal, partly of sealskin. Beside him lay a sheath-knife, much worn from frequent whetting...\\"Land Under the Pole Star, pg. 294 Since Herjolfsnes was the only major sea-facing homestead in Norse Greenland, and thus most visible and accessible to visiting ships, many have speculated that Jon The Greenlander's landfall was at or near Herjolfsnes, and the corpse he discovered perhaps being that of the last Norse Greenlander, who perished alone with none to bury him. This account comes from the early 16th century, but it is not clear when the incident actually happened. Early examination of human remains from the Herjolfsnes churchyard gave rise to a belief that its inhabitants had died out from inbreeding and overall degeneration from extreme cultural and geographic isolation. However, Helge Ingstad disputed this as a faulty assumption that was made after only a cursory analysis of a particularly bad sample of remains. Ingstad asserted that on balance, the Herjolfsnes graveyard shows the picture of a relatively healthy and prosperous people who generally reflected the social and religious mores of Northern European Christendom.Land Under the Pole Star, pg. 256 & 308 A growing volume of explorers and whalers were once again beginning to land in Greenland by the 16th century, but it was not until the early 18th century that a comprehensive official effort was made by the then-unified Danish-Norwegian crown to re-connect with the lost colony,Finn Gad, The History of Greenland: 1700-1782, Volume 2 (London: C. Hurst, 1973) pg. 15 a job given to Apostle Hans Egede. From reading Icelandic sagas, Egede knew the names of the old Norse homesteads and their associated fjords, but not their locations. A major source of confusion was that the Norse Greenlanders' Eastern, Middle and Western settlements, despite their names, were all located on Greenland's west coast, running south to north respectively. Egede held the then-common mistaken belief that major Eastern Settlement homesteads such as Herjolfsnes were to be found on Greenland's forbidding east coast.The History of Greenland, pg. 227 Throughout the remainder of his life, Egede was said to have fervently believed in the existence of a remnant population of Norse Greenlanders living in a yet-to-be- found Eastern Settlement, when in fact he had already thoroughly explored its ruins. As a result, maps of Greenland from this period often perpetuated the misunderstanding by showing Herjolfsnes at various locations on the east coast, in contrast to the accurate placement shown on the Sk√°lholt Map nearly two hundred years earlier. A 1747 map of Greenland by English map engraver Emanuel Bowen, based on Hans Egede's descriptions, incorrectly placing Herjolfsnes halfway up on the east coast. == Excavation and discovery of Norse garments == By the early 19th century, visitors and local Inuit had begun finding artifacts and bits of clothing embedded in the western shoreline nearest the Herjolfsnes church ruins: the sea level had risen considerably since the Norse period and was eroding the grounds around the old church. The formal re-discovery of the graveyard (by Europeans) was in the early 19th century when a missionary observed that a nearby Inuit house had a load- bearing doorway that was fashioned from an old tombstone bearing the name Hroar Kolgrimsson. A trading clerk was also said to have found a Norse wool \\"sailor's jacket\\" near the church ruins. This prompted a formal excavation attempt in 1839 and the discovery of fair-haired human remains confirmed the site was a Norse cemetery.Woven Into The Earth pg. 17 Subsequent digging in the following decades revealed more artifacts, human remains and garments. The diggings also revealed other buildings besides the church, including the main house and adjoining banquet hall, a byre and some outbuildings. In the ruins of the church, archaeologists found a significant quantity of charcoal, suggesting a conflagration at some point. The local Inuit's name for the site, Ikigait (\\"the place destroyed by fire\\") is further evidence of this.Land Under the Pole Star, pg. 254 It is possible that other buildings at the site were even closer to the shoreline than the church, and were claimed by the rising sea level some time after the disappearance of the Norse. More recent soil- testing indicates a landslide occurred at some point in the 18th century, and may have eradicated the remains of other Norse buildings at the site.Saga Trails, pg. 78 The increasing number of wadmal fragments and garments being pulled from the ruins - and concern that the rising water line would soon submerge the site - prompted the Danish National Museum to launch an urgent formal excavation in 1921 led by Paul Norland. He estimated that the shoreline had retreated another 12 metres into the cemetery since its rediscovery less than a century before, and was by then nearly touching the remains of the church's southern wall. Comparing Norland's 1921 site plan drawing against modern photographs, the high water line does not appear to have risen significantly since then. Norland stated in his book, Buried Norsemen at Herjolfsnes, that he'd never worked on a project that attracted such keen interest from the local inhabitants. One woman informed him that she had become so accustomed to finding pieces of preserved Norse wool that she had fashioned children's garments from the centuries-old fabric, but the wool unsurprisingly was not strong enough to make the clothing practical. Working under difficult conditions during the short digging season, Norland and his crew were eventually successful in recovering full and partial costumes, hats, hoods and stockings. The recovery of these clothes is considered one of the most significant European archaeological finds of the 20th century. Prior to the Herjolfsnes diggings, these types of garments had essentially only been seen in medieval paintings. Careful analysis and reconstruction of the garments revealed the skill of the Herjolfsnes inhabitants at spinning and weaving, as well as their desire to follow European fashions such as the cotehardie, the liripipe hood and hats in the Burgunderhuen and Pillbox styles. Later analysis using carbon dating suggests that garments were being manufactured at Herjolfsnes as late as the 1430s.Woven into the Earth, pg. 144 Clothing found in the Herjolfsnes graveyard The garments had been stained a dark brown from being buried, but testing revealed the presence of iron on some of them that appeared to have been deliberately and selectively introduced during manufacture rather than through ground contamination. This suggests that the Herjolfsnes weavers created a non-vegetation-based red dye from a local source of mineral ferric oxide. Although iron was historically used as a mordant for dyes, the Herjolfsnes samples are believed to be the only known instance of medieval Europeans using the mineral to create the red dye itself, presumably in the absence of the madder plant that was commonly used to make red dye back in Europe.Woven into the Earth, pg. 27, 90-91 In one sense, the quality, innovation and fashion awareness shown in the Herjolfsnes garments throw even more mystery on the disappearance of the settlement and the Norse colony. As Helge Ingstad observed, \\"Many of these garments were not worn by common people of Europe, but only by the well-to-do middle class. Altogether the finds testify to a cultivated and fairly prosperous community; certainly not to a people on the brink of extinction.\\"Land Under the Pole Star pg. 256 In addition to the work of Norland himself, the Herjolfsnes clothing has been exhaustively studied by Else √òsterg√•rd in her books, Woven into the Earth and Medieval Garments Reconstructed. == Later settlement == By the time of the Danish-Norwegian re-colonization of Greenland starting in the 18th century, the former site of Herjolfsnes was known as Ikigait by local Inuit Greenlanders. The community was abandoned at some point in the early 20th century, with the inhabitants perhaps having moved to nearby Narsarmijit on the other side of the fjord. A few concrete and wooden foundations from the time can be seen in current photographs of the site. Herjolfsnes / Ikigait is now uninhabited. == Fictional depiction == In The Greenlanders, a 1988 historical fiction novel by Jane Smiley, Herjolfsnes is depicted as being set apart from the other districts in the Eastern Settlement owing to its location and its wealthy inhabitants, who wore distinct clothing and took pride in their greater knowledge of the outside world. == References  External links == * Satellite view of the Herjolfsnes peninsula. * A kayker's photograph of the approach to Herjolfsnes, looking northeast.

SSaDV has been suggested to be an etiological agent of sea star wasting disease, but conclusive evidence has not yet been obtained. ==Epidemiology== SSaDV affects sea stars from southern Alaska to Baja California. It tends to occur in large outbreaks with high mortality, as it has in 1972, 1978, 2013, and 2014. See Sea star wasting disease. The virus was isolated from wasting Pycnopodia helianthoides, and detected in small quantities in healthy sea stars and aquarium sediments. The highest viral load was found in the body wall of the central disk. ==Structure== The physical characteristics of SSaDV are similar to the other members of the genus Ambidensovirus. It is the only viral candidate proposed to cause wasting in sea stars, and is predicted to be a non-enveloped icosahedral particle at ~25 nm. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * ==External links== * ViralZone: Densovirus * Sea Star Wasting Syndrome Updates Category:Densovirinae ","title":"Sea star-associated densovirus"},{"id":"46414870","text":"Proboscipedia (pb) is a protein coding gene in Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly. ==Function== This hox gene participates in the development of the labial and maxillary palps and mouthparts in the Drosophila fly.

It is a symbolic story of ill-fated love set in central Europe. ==Synopsis== A magical and realistic vision of an unbalanced world takes place in a village in the mountains at the end of the world - at an unknown time. The village in a picturesque setting is a metaphor for the world and humanity at the rise of the 3rd millennium. During the 25 years when the story takes place, we can see change over several generations and various symbols of different civilizations, church and culture. The main motif of the film is the love between Verona and Goran. Their passionate relationship is so different from any other and so they have to be punished in the name of so-called morality and equality. By following them, the village people are trying to hide their transgressions against nature and themselves. Patriarchal rituals are in conflict with a civilization without God and equality. Nature punishes them with earthquakes. The houses of all the guilty people are destroyed. Wolves are a symbol of danger. == Cast == * Deana Horv√°thov√° - Verona * Milan Bah√∫l - Goran * Joachim Kemmer - Madina * Kl√°ra Issov√° - Veronika * Jana ≈†vandov√° - Marlyn * Jir√≠ Krytin√°r - Juzek * Vladim√≠r Javorsk√Ω - Semek * Pavel Landovsk√Ω - Rychtar, the magistrate * Peter Simun - The Barber * Yvetta Kornov√° - Margot * Sandra Pogodov√° - Fagot * Lucie Vondr√°ckov√° - Lucie * Vladimir Sadilek - Pop * Matƒõj H√°dek - Michal ==Director about the movie== ‚ÄúApart from Nostradamus and the visions of the future you can hear my own worries about mankind in this absurdity.

His parents Carl Wilhelm Borchsenius (1803‚Äì1858) and Elisabeth Dorothea (Arneson) Borchsenius (1804‚Äì1839) never came to the United States. His father worked in the mercantile business in Denmark. Borchsenius received his educational training at the Nestved high school and academy. In 1856, he sailed for the US arriving in July at Madison, Wisconsin. In Denmark, he had been in the same business as his father, but in the US, he struggled with the new language. For several months he ran the mail stage between Madison and Portage. He felt that the best means of accomplishing his object was to learn a trade, so he served an apprenticeship at the Norwegian language newspaper The Norwegian American (Den Norske Amerikaner), and soon afterward was able to purchase controlling interest in it, changing its name to the North Star (Nordstjernen). He maintained control of the newspaper until 1860, when it was absorbed by the Norwegian language Emigranten which was published by Carl Fredrik Solberg (1833‚Äì1924). Through his publication, he became interested in politics and in 1858 was the candidate of the Democratic Party for county clerk, being defeated by a small majority. General Lucius Fairchild and Wisconsin Associate Justice Silas U. Pinney were on the same ticket and were also defeated. In 1861, Borchsenius entered the United States Army as adjutant of the Fifteenth Wisconsin Infantry, but owing to severe illness, he resigned before the cessation of hostilities. Before entering the army, he changed his allegiance from the Democratic to the Republican party. After he returned from the war, Governor James T. Lewis, who was then Wisconsin Secretary of State, appointed him to clerkship in his office, from which he was transferred to the state land department where he served for five years. He was then elected county clerk of Dane County and served as such four years. He was then appointed United States Internal Revenue Gauger and served one year. He also purchased the Capital House hotel in Madison, which he ran from 1872 to 1874. Borchsenius attended law school in Madison and was admitted to the Dane County bar in 1876. In 1875, when Harrison Ludington ran for state governor, Borchsenius published a campaign paper called The Wisconsin Banner, which was instrumental in electing both the governor and secretary of state on the Republican ticket. Governor Ludington then appointed Borchsenius timber agent for the state to protect the railroad lands on the Chippewa and Red Cedar rivers. While serving in this capacity, he became interested in northern Wisconsin and in 1877 he moved to Baldwin, to engage in the real estate and loan business. While residing in Baldwin, he was twice elected president of the village. He was also elected chairman of the county board. In 1891, President Benjamin Harrison appointed Borchsenius chief of the Internal Revenue Service in the Treasury Department, in which capacity he served until President Grover Cleveland was elected. In 1896, Borchsenius was elected a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly from St. Croix CountyWisconsin Blue Book 1897, Biographical Sketch of Hans Borchsenius, pg. 694 intending that this should be his last political office. At the end of his legislative term, Borchsenius retired from active life and returned to Madison to live, building the home. ==Personal life== On November 10, 1859, he married Martha Marie Bakke (1841‚Äì1927). She was born in Christiana, Norway. They had three children: William Carl, Dora H., and George Valdemar, who served as clerk of the United States court in Alaska. Borchsenius identified with the Lutheran Church. At his death in 1908, he was buried at Forest Hill Cemetery in Dane County, Wisconsin. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * ==Related Reading== *Lovoll, Odd Sverre (2010) Norwegian Newspapers in America: Connecting Norway and the New Land (Minnesota Historical Society) ==External links== * Category:1832 births Category:1908 deaths Category:American Lutherans Category:People from N√¶stved Municipality Category:American people of Danish descent Category:American newspaper people Category:Businesspeople from Madison, Wisconsin Category:Editors of Wisconsin newspapers Category:People of Wisconsin in the American Civil War Category:Internal Revenue Service people Category:Mayors of places in Wisconsin Category:County supervisors in Wisconsin Category:Members of the Wisconsin State Assembly Category:Danish emigrants to the United States Category:Wisconsin Democrats Category:Wisconsin Republicans Category:19th- century American journalists Category:American male journalists Category:Politicians from Madison, Wisconsin Category:People from Baldwin, Wisconsin Category:19th-century American male writers ","title":"Hans Borchsenius"},{"id":"46414996","text":"Pauline Stella Sanchez is a theoretical artist/visual essayist and Professor of Art, Film and Critical Studies at the Art Center College of Design, (ACCD).

The video shows Roberts walking through various neighborhoods of New York City, wearing jeans and a black crewneck T-shirt, with a hidden camera recording her from the front. The two-minute video includes selected footage from ten hours, showcasing what has been described by some as \\"catcalls\\" and street harassment of Roberts by men, reporting there were 108 such instances. The behaviors included people saying \\"hello\\" or \\"good morning\\", comments on Roberts' appearance, attempts to initiate conversation, angry remarks, and men following her for several minutes. As of July 2020, the video has received over 49 million views on YouTube. ==Production and goals== Roberts said that she got involved with the video by responding to a Craigslist posting by Rob Bliss a few months prior, and that although Rob Bliss told her that this was potentially a viral video, she was skeptical but was open to giving it a try. Rob Bliss himself shot the video by walking a few feet in front of Roberts with a GoPro camera in his backpack. Bliss and Emily May (executive director and co-founder of Hollaback!, for whom the video was made) clarified in comments to The Washington Post that Roberts' dress choice (jeans and a T-shirt) was made so as to debunk the misconception that women only get harassed if they wear revealing clothing. Roberts also said that she experienced similar harassment every day on the streets of New York City as was shown in the video. ==Reception== The video was hailed for providing visual proof of what many considered an important problem relating to the treatment of women in city streets. Several commentators disputed the implicit characterization of many incidents in the video, such as people casually greeting Roberts, as harassment. Others responded that, even though the words themselves may not seem like harassment, the social context, including that they were directed only at Roberts rather than at male passersby, made them harassment. Another criticism was that the video was racially biased because it depicted black men harassing Roberts, a Jewish woman, even though the video creator said that she was catcalled by people of all races. Hollaback! responded to the criticism by noting that this video was only the first in a series of many videos that would document different forms of street harassment, and said it regretted any racial bias in the video. An analysis of the video documented that most of the scenes shown in the video were taken in neighborhoods with predominantly black and Hispanic populations, raising the question of whether the video was shot mostly in these locations, or whether harassment was more prevalent in these locations than in others. Some critics combined both angles of criticism, claiming that the comments that Roberts considered street harassment were so perceived by her (and by her audience) because of race and class differences between her and the men making the comments. Others disputed the characterization of the video as racist. Roberts, the woman featured in the video, reported receiving death threats within days of the video being released, and said that she no longer felt safe. Roberts later filed a lawsuit against the video's producers. However, the lawsuit was dismissed before going to trial. In 2015, Roberts was named as one of The Forward 50. == Response videos== * A spoof Funny or Die video showed a man walking around for ten hours in NYC and getting harassed. *Josh Apter and Gary Mahmoud of the YouTube channel Cringe Factory created a spoof of 10 Hours of Princess Leia Walking in NYC.http://time.com/3579359/princess- leia-catcalling-spoof-video/ * Comedian Scott Rogowsky also made a spoof video showing 10 hours of walking through NYC as a Jew. * A man dressed as a hipster also made a spoof video, walking through the streets of Austin, Texas. * A male model walked around New York City for three hours, recorded via hidden camera by Model Pranksters, was shown to have received over 30 catcalls, many of them qualitatively similar to what Roberts received. The video was taken as evidence that an attractive man in a body-flattering outfit could get harassed in much the same way that many women did, but commentators noted that whereas harassment was a reality for almost all women, only extremely good-looking men had to deal with it. * A video was shot in Auckland, New Zealand, with a very similar setup to the original video, featuring model Nicola Simpson. The video reported no catcalling instances, and noted that she was stopped only twice, once by somebody asking for directions and another time by somebody who complimented her on her appearance but followed up by apologizing for stopping her. The video was cited as evidence that harassment is not an inevitable reality of life but rather dependent on the culture in a region, and that it was possible for big cities to have substantially lower levels of harassment. * A woman walking around New York City, initially dressed in ordinary Western clothing (for five hours) and then in a hijab (for another five hours). Although she got harassed in a manner similar to Roberts in the first five hours, she didn't get harassed in the next five hours. The video was created by Karim Metwaly and the woman in the video was a friend of his. The implied message in favor of wearing the hijab was critiqued by commentators, who argued that such messages continued the tradition of blaming the victim and requiring women to be the ones to adjust their behavior while being judged by the male gaze, a problem allegedly prevalent both in the West and in the Middle East and other Islamic countries. * A woman, Pooja Singh, dressed in miniskirt and a tank top was filmed by IndieTube walking through the streets of Mumbai, India. Although a few men looked at her covertly, nobody approached or harassed her. The video ended with the note: \\"Not even a single incident of woman street harassment took place in a city that has diversified culture, demographics and economy. The female citizens are safe, respected and treated unbiased in this city which never sleeps.\\" Multiple commentators were pleasantly surprised and praised Mumbai residents for their civility and for minding their own business. * A man dressed in a stereotypically gay manner walked around New York City for 3 hours, recorded by hidden video. The creators identified over 50 instances of street harassment faced by the man. The video was cited as evidence of the existence of openly expressed homophobia in society. ==References * Category:2010s feminist films Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Fourth-wave feminism Category:Sexual harassment in the United States Category:Viral videos Category:2014 YouTube videos Category:2014 films ","title":"10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman"},{"id":"46415117","text":"The Bailey‚ÄìRugg Building was a historic commercial building located at 219-225 North Neil Street in Champaign, Illinois. == Description and history == Businessmen David Bailey and Daniel Rugg built the building as a joint venture in 1871; each merchant occupied half of the building, with a common staircase connecting the two halves.

Barrett-Anderson earned her B.A. at the University of San Francisco and her J.D. at the University of Santa Clara School of Law. She was the first Chamorro woman to be admitted to practice law in Guam. She operated a private law practice on Guam until she was appointed Attorney General by Governor Joseph Franklin Ada in 1987. She later won election to the office. She resigned as attorney general in 1994 to run for the Guam Legislature, where she served two terms. In 1997, she was appointed to the Superior Court of Guam by Governor Carl T.C. Gutierrez, and she was confirmed as a judge by the Legislature in 1998. In 1990, she opposed the enactment of a law restricting abortion to cases in which the life of the mother is threatened. When it passed and became the most restrictive abortion law in the U.S., she said her role had \\"now shifted to one of law enforcement\\". In 2014, twenty years after she left the post of Attorney General, she ran again for the office and won, defeating incumbent Leonardo Rapadas by a wide margin in the November 2014 general election. In April 2015, Barrett-Anderson ordered the director of the Guam Department of Public Health and Social Services to begin processing same-sex marriage licenses on April 15, 2015, which would have made Guam the first U.S. territory to allow same- sex marriage. == See also == * First women lawyers around the world * List of female state attorneys-general in the United States == References  *Official site - Category:1953 births Category:21st- century American politicians Category:Attorneys General of Guam Category:Chamorro people Category:Guamanian judges Category:Guamanian lawyers Category:Living people Category:Members of the Legislature of Guam Category:Santa Clara University alumni Category:University of San Francisco alumni ","title":"Elizabeth Barrett-Anderson"},{"id":"46415215","text":"Proton City Highway, Federal Route 258, is a major highway in Perak, Malaysia.

The framework of this approach closely refers to the study of perception, action, learning, memory and cognition within Neuroscience. Analyzing the brain at the neural level, for example, provides an enhanced understanding of how information flow can be conveyed and exchanged within the mechanisms of a computer in an adaptive, integrated, unified, and autonomous manner. This example demonstrates the application of neuroscience at the microscopic level among computational dynamics. Computational neuroscience is not limited to microscopic levels with regard to biology. Parallels along microscopic and macroscopic levels of biological applications also exist.

Originally named Dyrafjeld, the sloop-rigged vessel was built on a Norwegian farm in 1889. The ship's early career was as a cargo ship in the Hardanger region, with occasional voyages as far afield as Russia. She was sold to new owners and rerigged as a galeas in the late 1920s. The sails were removed during World War II, but continued in merchant service until the mid-1970s. After a series of accidents, the vessel was laid up, then sold to new owners, who restored the vessel and renamed her Anna Kristina. Charter work occurred throughout the 1980s, including involvement in the First Fleet Re-enactment Voyage. ==Design and construction== The vessel was a Hardangerjakt built on a farm in Stangvik, Norway, during 1889, based on a Det Norske Veritas plan.Clarke & Iggulden, Sailing Home, p. vii The hull was long, with a beam of and a draught of .Clarke & Iggulden, Sailing Home, p. 6 She was sloop-rigged, with a square topsail. ==Operational history== The vessel was originally named Dyrafjeld. Most of her early operations were cargo runs: dried cod from the Hardanger region to Bergen, then returning with general cargo. On occasion, the vessel would haul timber from Riga, Russia. Dyrafjeld was sail powered until 1900, when a 12-horsepower engine was installed. In the late 1920s, Dyrafjeld was sold to new owners, who rerigged the vessel as a galeas. At the start of World War II, the vessel's rigging was removed, and her engine upgraded. The ship continued in the cargo trade, but capsized in 1975 when a cargo of timber shifted. She was recovered, but damaged again in 1986 in a collision. The vessel was laid up until 1977, when she was sold to new owners, who restored her as a galeas-rigged Hardangerjakt. In this configuration, she had a mast height of , and a total sail area of . The restoration work was completed in 1981, with the vessel renamed Anna Kristina. The vessel sailed on numerous charters, including film work and a two-year deployment to Spitzbergen.

Prior to the voyage, she was refurbished with a Volvo engine capable of reaching , along with increased crew capacity.Clarke & Iggulden, Sailing Home, pp. vii, 6 She left England for Australia in May 1987, and sailed with the fleet to Tenerife and Rio de Janeiro.

Not merely a television personality with a media imprint that extends from religious television to worldwide mainstream outlets, Bishop McClendon heralds a timely message of hope, reconciliation, and restoration that's delivered with an engaging, passionate quality that has impacted millions. Today, he's called upon by diplomats, heads of state, celebrities, and private citizens for his wise counsel and poignant perspective, but Bishop McClendon's ministry spans decades. (citations needed). ==Early life== McClendon was born in Decatur, Illinois, on June 7, 1965 to Levi and Miriam McClendon. He began preaching at 15 and became a pastor at 19. But it was in 1991 that the members of West Adams Foursquare Church welcomed then-Evangelist Clarence McClendon to the pastorate of their church. He'd begun to hone his skill and his passion for preaching and pastoring, and this pastoral appointment was a breakthrough moment. Located in South Los Angeles on the corner of West Adams Boulevard and La Brea Avenue at the time, only a few dozen people gathered in the small wooden building on Sunday mornings. But it didn't take long for word to spread that there was a young pastor whose prophetic message and vision were ablaze in LA's inner city. As Pastor McClendon faithfully served the scant gathering of congregants there, he preached as if thousands were in attendance. And soon, thousands were present - and tuning in via television from around the world. By 1993, West Adams Foursquare Church took a new name: Church of the Harvest. The congregation was multiplying and a new worship facility was built to accommodate over 8,000 weekly attendees. Today, Bishop McClendon is the Prophet and Teacher of The Place of Grace, a growing multi-ethnic congregation located in Los Angeles. ==Career and personal life== In 1997, Harvest Fire Media hit television airwaves for the first time and the international prophetic and apostolic ministry that had been cultivated for years from Illinois to California was now in millions of homes in hundreds of nations weekly. Harvest Fire Media continues to offer weekly and monthly international television broadcasts: ‚ÄúA Miracle for You‚Äù and ‚ÄúYour Time For Miracles,‚Äù in which Bishop McClendon shares the word of God and the message of Jesus Christ to more than 350 million homes throughout North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. The Full Harvest Network of Churches, Ministries and Entrepreneurs offers spiritual covering and accountability through the word of God and covenant ministry connections. His PrayerForce network and other ministry initiatives are designed to empower and strengthen the faith of those who participate in them. And his itinerant ministry is as strong as ever as he ministers at crusades and events in the United States and overseas. His voice can be heard in groundbreaking spoken messages and books like \\"The Healing Project,\\" \\"The X Blessing,\\" and \\"And When You Pray.\\" And in the uplifting music produced by his ministry: \\"Give Glory To God\\" and Shout Hallelujah featuring the Harvest Fire Mega Mass Choir, which was released on April 18, 2000 by Integrity Music. Shout Hallelujah placed at No. 9 on the Billboard Gospel Albums chart for 24 weeks. He is the conductor of the Harvest Fire Mega Mass Choir. McClendon has also served as a member of the Do Something Foundation, and as a regent for California Faith-Based Initiatives. McClendon has appeared on the \\"CBS Evening News\\", ABC's \\"Nightline\\", Black Entertainment Television, and \\"G's to Gents\\" on MTV. ==Discography== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" center;\\" + List of selected studio albums, with selected chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\"  Album details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\"  Peak chart positions - !style=\\"width:3em; font-size:90%\\"US Gos - !scope=\\"row\\"Shout Hallelujah  * Released: April 18, 2000 * * CD, digital download  9 } ==References * Official website Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:African-American musicians Category:African-American Christians Category:Musicians from Decatur, Illinois Category:Musicians from Los Angeles Category:Songwriters from Illinois Category:Songwriters from California ","title":"Clarence McClendon"},{"id":"46415315","text":"The Grotowski Institute in Wroc≈Çaw (Instytut im.

Qualification was primarily based on the FIE Official Ranking as of April 4, 2016, with further individual places available at 4 zonal qualifying tournaments. For the team events, 8 teams qualified in each event. Each team must be composed of 3 fencers. The top 4 ranked teams qualified. The next best ranked team from each zone (Africa, the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Oceania) qualified as long as it was ranked in the top 16. If a zone had no teams ranked between 5th and 16th, the best placed nation not already qualified would be selected regardless of zone. For individual events with corresponding team events, the 3 fencers from the team event qualified for individual competition automatically. 7 more places were awarded based on the rankings (ignoring fencers from countries with team qualifications and considering only the top fencer from each country): the top 2 fencers from each of Europe, Asia-Oceania, and the Americas, and the top 1 fencer from Africa, qualified. 4 more places (1 per zone) were awarded through zone qualifying tournaments; only countries without a qualified fencer in an event were eligible to participate in these zone qualifying tournaments. For individual events without corresponding team events, the top 14 fencers in the rankings (adjusted to include only the top 2 fencers per country) qualified. The next 2 best ranked fencers from each zone (but from different countries) also qualified. 10 spots were allocated through zone qualifying tournaments (4 for Europe, 3 for Asia-Oceania, 2 for the Americas, and 1 for Africa); only countries without a qualified fencer in an event were eligible to participate in these zone qualifying tournaments and each country could send only 1 fencer.

A high school star at Edwardsville High School, Harris played collegiately at Marquette University. He was named the SIUE Cougars' new coach in April 2015 after spending thirteen years as an assistant in five different Division I programs. On March 11, 2019, SIUE announced that Harris' contract had not been renewed. Harris is currently (Fall 2019) a Recruiting Specialist for Next College Student Athlete, a company that facilitates the contacting of college coaches by high school and middle school students. ==Biography== Jon Harris was born in Edwardsville, Illinois in 1981, the son of Robert \\"Bob\\" and Mary Ann Harris. He followed in his father's footsteps by starring in basketball at Edwardsville High School (EHS), remaining in town with an aunt when his father's employment was transferred to Chicago. Harris was the 1998 St. Louis Post-Dispatch Player of the Year, a USA Today honorable mention All-American, and an Associated Press (AP) All-State selection. This was despite the team's failure to advance beyond the sectional semifinals in the IHSA state tournament‚Äî as a junior, the EHS Tigers lost to Alton in a six overtime game; as a senior, the Tigers fell to Collinsville on a 70-foot \\"buzzer-beater\\" with both games played at SIUE's Vadalabene Center. After graduating from EHS, Harris attended Marquette University in Milwaukee, in his sophomore through senior seasons, coached by Tom Crean. Although he started only 22 games, he had major playing time in every game under Crean, and was team captain as a junior and senior. He finished his playing career ranked #20 on the Conference USA rebounding list and was a career 53% shooter from the floor. Teamed with Dwyane Wade, Harris' 2001-02 Golden Eagles team went 26‚Äì7, finishing in the NCAA Tournament and earning a #9 AP ranking. The Golden Eagles fell victim to one of the notorious 12 vs. 5 upsets to Tulsa (one of three that year). Harris graduated from Marquette in 2002 with a bachelor's degree in psychology. He is married to the former Heidi Bowman, who was also a four-year basketball star at Marquette, earning Conference USA All-Conference honors in 2001. They have three children, Hailey, Leah, and Jaxon. ==Coaching career== Harris began his coaching career immediately after graduation, joining Tom Crean's staff as graduate assistant; that 2002-03 team, led by future NBA All-Star Dwyane Wade, built a record of 27‚Äì6 on the way to the Final Four. Following that first season at Marquette, Harris moved to the staff of Tod Kowalczyk at Green Bay, becoming, at age 22, the youngest full-time assistant coach in the country. In his five seasons at Green Bay, Harris was instrumental in developing eight All-Horizon League players, and while recruiting Indiana for Green Bay, he got to know then-Purdue assistant Cuonzo Martin. When Martin was named the head coach at Missouri State, he quickly hired Harris as one of his first assistants. The Bears improved from 11 wins in 2008-09 to 24‚Äì12 and the CIT championship in 2009‚Äì10, and to 26‚Äì9 with the school's first Missouri Valley Conference regular season title and the second round of the NIT the following season. When Martin moved on to Tennessee, Harris was his first assistant hired. After seasons of 19‚Äì15, 20‚Äì13, and 24‚Äì13, Martin took the coaching job at California, and Harris followed, but he stayed only one season in Berkeley before returning home for the SIUE job. After four seasons with a record that was worse than the previous four years, on March 11, 2019, SIUE announced that Harris's contract had not been renewed after a four-year record of 31 and 88 losses. However, Harris's full staff of assistant coaches Brian Barone, Charles \\"Bubba\\" Wells, and Mike Waldo and Director of Operations Casey Wyllie were all retained, and Barone was later named as interim head coach. ==Head coaching recordReferences * SIU Edwardsville profile Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:American men's basketball coaches Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball coaches from Illinois Category:Basketball players from Illinois Category:California Golden Bears men's basketball coaches Category:College men's basketball head coaches in the United States Category:Green Bay Phoenix men's basketball coaches Category:Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball players Category:Missouri State Bears basketball coaches Category:People from Edwardsville, Illinois Category:SIU Edwardsville Cougars men's basketball coaches Category:Sportspeople from Greater St. Louis Category:Tennessee Volunteers basketball coaches Category:Forwards (basketball) ","title":"Jon Harris (basketball)"},{"id":"46415531","text":"He Is Never Coming Back is the second studio album by American metal band Gaza.

It is schema-agnostic, horizontally scalable and generally classified as a NoSQL database. == Data model == Internally, Cosmos DB stores \\"items\\" in \\"containers\\", with these two concepts being surfaced differently depending on the API used (these would be \\"documents\\" in \\"collections\\" when using the MongoDB-compatible API, for example). Containers are grouped in \\"databases\\", which are analogous to namespaces above containers. Containers are schema- agnostic, which means that no schema is enforced when adding items. By default, every field in each item is automatically indexed, generally providing good performance without tuning to specific query patterns. These defaults can be modified by setting an indexing policy which can specify, for each field, the index type and precision desired. Cosmos DB offers two types of indexes: * range, supporting range and ORDER BY queries, * spatial, supporting spatial queries from points, polygons and line strings encoded in standard GeoJSON fragments. Containers can also enforce unique key constraints to ensure data integrity. Each Cosmos DB container exposes a change feed, which clients can subscribe to in order to get notified of new items being added or updated in the container. Item deletions are currently not exposed by the change feed. Changes are persisted by Cosmos DB, which makes it possible to request changes from any point in time since the creation of the container. A \\"Time to Live\\" (or TTL) can be specified at the container level to let Cosmos DB automatically delete items after a certain amount of time expressed in seconds. This countdown starts after the last update of the item. If needed, the TTL can also be overloaded at the item level. == Multi-model APIs == The internal data model described in the previous section is exposed through: * a proprietary SQL API * five different compatibility APIs, exposing endpoints that are partially compatible with the wire protocols of MongoDB, Gremlin, Cassandra, Azure Table Storage, and etcd; these compatibility APIs make it possible for any compatible application to connect to and use Cosmos DB through standard drivers or SDKs, while also benefiting from Cosmos DB's core features like partitioning and global distribution. {  ! rowspan=\\"2\\" API ! colspan=\\"2\\" Internal mapping ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Compatibility status and remarks - Containers Items - MongoDb Collections Documents Compatible with wire protocol version 6 and server version 3.6 of the MongoDB. - Gremlin Graphs Nodes and edges Compatible with version 3.2 of the Gremlin specification. - Cassandra Table Row Compatible with version 4 of the Cassandra Query Language (CQL) wire protocol. - Azure Table Storage Table Item  - etcd Key Value Compatible with version 3 of etcd. }  SQL API  The SQL API lets clients create, update and delete containers and items. Items can be queried with a read-only, JSON-friendly SQL dialect. As Cosmos DB embeds a JavaScript engine, the SQL API also enables: * Stored procedures. Functions that bundle an arbitrarily complex set of operations and logic into an ACID-compliant transaction. They are isolated from changes made while the stored procedure is executing and either all write operations succeed or they all fail, leaving the database in a consistent state. Stored procedures are executed in a single partition. Therefore, the caller must provide a partition key when calling into a partitioned collection. Stored procedures can be used to make up for the lack of certain functionality. For instance, the lack of aggregation capability is made up for by the implementation of an OLAP cube as a stored procedure in the open sourced documentdb-lumenize project. * Triggers. Functions that get executed before or after specific operations (like on a document insertion for example) that can either alter the operation or cancel it. Triggers are only executed on request. * User-defined functions (UDF). Functions that can be called from and augment the SQL query language making up for limited SQL features. The SQL API is exposed as a REST API, which itself is implemented in various SDKs that are officially supported by Microsoft and available for .NET, .NET Core, Node.js (JavaScript), Java and Python. == Partitioning == Cosmos DB added automatic partitioning capability in 2016 with the introduction of partitioned containers. Behind the scenes, partitioned containers span multiple physical partitions with items distributed by a client-supplied partition key. Cosmos DB automatically decides how many partitions to spread data across depending on the size and throughput needs. When partitions are added or removed, the operation is performed without any downtime so data remains available while it is re-balanced across the new or remaining partitions. Before partitioned containers were available, it was common to write custom code to partition data and some of the Cosmos DB SDKs explicitly supported several different partitioning schemes. That mode is still available but only recommended when storage and throughput requirements do not exceed the capacity of one container, or when the built-in partitioning capability does not otherwise meet the application's needs. == Tunable throughput == Developers can specify desired throughput to match the application's expected load. Cosmos DB reserves resources (memory, CPU and IOPS) to guarantee the requested throughput while maintaining request latency below 10ms for both reads and writes at the 99th percentile. Throughput is specified in Request Units (RUs) per second. The cost to read a 1 KB item is 1 Request Unit (or 1 RU). Select by 'id' operations consume lower number of RUs compared to Delete, Update, and Insert operations for the same document. Large queries (e.g. aggregations like count) and stored procedure executions can consume hundreds to thousands of RUs depending on the complexity of the operations needed. The minimum billing is per hours. Throughput can be provisioned at either the container or the database level. When provisioned at the database level, the throughput is shared across all the containers within that database, with the additional ability to have dedicated throughput for some containers. The throughput provisioned on an Azure Cosmos container is exclusively reserved for that container. The default maximum RUs that can be provisioned per database and per container are 1,000,000 RUs, but customers can get this limit increased by contacting customer support. As an example of costing, using a single region instance, a count of 1,000,000 records of 1k each in 5s requires 1,000,000 RUs At $0.008/hour, which would equal $800. Two regions double the cost. == Global distribution == Cosmos DB databases can be configured to be available in any of the Microsoft Azure regions (54 regions as of December 2018), letting application developers place their data closer to where their users are. Each container's data gets transparently replicated across all configured regions. Adding or removing regions is performed without any downtime or impact on performance. By leveraging Cosmos DB's multi-homing API, applications don't have to be updated or redeployed when regions are added or removed, as Cosmos DB will automatically route their requests to the regions that are available and closest to their location.  Consistency levels  Data consistency is configurable on Cosmos DB, letting application developers choose among five different levels: * Eventual does not guarantee any ordering and only ensures that replicas will eventually converge * Consistent prefix adds ordering guarantees on top of eventual * Session is scoped to a single client connection and basically ensures a read-your-own- writes consistency for each client; it is the default consistency level * Bounded staleness augments consistent prefix by ensuring that reads won't lag beyond x versions of an item or some specified time window * Strong consistency (or linearizable) ensures that clients always read the latest globally committed write The desired consistency level is defined at the account level but can be overridden on a per request basis by using a specific HTTP header or the corresponding feature exposed by the SDKs. All five consistency levels have been specified and verified using the TLA+ specification language, with the TLA+ model being open-sourced on GitHub.  Multi-master  Cosmos DB's original distribution model involves one single write region, with all other regions being read-only replicas. In March 2018, a new multi-master capability was announced, enabling multiple regions to be write replicas within a global deployment. Potential merge conflicts that may arise when different write regions issue concurrent, conflicting writes can be resolved by either the default Last Write Wins policy, or a custom JavaScript function. == Analytical Store == This feature announced in May 2020 is a fully isolated column store for enabling large scale analytics against operational data in the Azure Cosmos DB, without any impact to its transactional workloads. This feature addresses the complexity and latency challenges that occur with the traditional ETL pipelines required to have a data repository optimized to execute Online analytical processing by automatically syncing the operational data into a separate column store suitable for large scale analytical queries to be performed in an optimized manner, resulting in improving the latency of such queries. Using Microsoft Azure Synapse Link for Cosmos DB, it is possible to build no-ETL Hybrid transactional/analytical processing solutions by directly linking to Azure Cosmos DB analytical store from Synapse Analytics. It enables to run near real-time large-scale analytics directly on the operational data. == Reception == Gartner Research positions Microsoft as the leader in the Magic Quadrant Operational Database Management Systems in 2016 and calls out the unique capabilities of Cosmos DB in their write-up. == Real-world use cases == These Microsoft services utilize Cosmos DB:http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p1668-shukla.pdf Microsoft Office, Skype, Active Directory, Xbox, MSN. In building a more globally-resilient application / system, Cosmos DB combines with other Azure services, such as Azure App Services and Azure Traffic Manager. == Cosmos DB Profiler == The Cosmos DB Profiler cloud cost optimization tool detects inefficient data queries in the interactions between an application and its Cosmos DB database. The profiler alerts users to wasted performance and excessive cloud expenditures. It also recommends how to resolve them by isolating and analyzing the code and directing its users to the exact location. == Limitations, criticism and cautions == * Limited backup/restore features. While automated backups are taken, they are limited in duration (only last two backups are retained over an 8-hour period). Restoration of backups can only be achieved by raising a support ticket and awaiting Microsoft Support Team's assistance. Furthermore, while the backup facility does protect against accidental deletion of databases and whole collections, it offers very little protection against document-level corruption, due to the fact that there is no \\"point-in-time\\" restore option. These limiting factors mean that Cosmos DB may not satisfy the long-term data retention policies and requirements of many organizations. * Triggers must be explicitly specified for each operation that you wish to use them which renders them ineffective as a mechanism for maintaining business logic consistency unless you can be certain that all the correct triggers are specified for every operation. * .NET LINQ language integrated queries are not fully supported. More and more LINQ support has been added over time, but developers are often confused when the LINQ code that they use on other systems fails to work as expected on Cosmos DB as evidenced by the large number of StackOverflow questions containing both tags. * Transactions are not currently supported at the API level, for example Cosmos DB does not participate in the .NET TransactionScope pattern. Transactions are only currently supported from within JavaScript stored procedures. * For the local development experience, a local emulator is available, but only for Microsoft Windows. This emulator can be accessed either as a program that runs in the background or as a Docker for Windows container image. The emulator is limited in features compared to the Cosmos DB service on Azure and is intended for development only. * SQL is very limited. Aggregations limited to COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG functions but no support for GROUP BY or other aggregation functionality found in database systems. However, stored procedures can be used to implement in-the-database aggregation capability. * \\"Collection\\" means something different in Cosmos DB. It is simply a bucket of documents. There is a tendency to equate them to tables where each collection would hold only a single type of document which is not recommended with Cosmos DB. Rather, developers are encouraged to distinguish document types with a \\"type\\" field or by adding an \\"isTypeA = true\\" field to all documents of TypeA, \\"isTypeB = true\\" for all documents of Type B, etc. This is especially confusing to developers that are coming from MongoDB which has a \\"collection\\" entity that is intended to be used in a very different way. * The lack of query plan visibility (e.g. \\"EXPLAIN\\" keyword in SQL). * Support only for pure JSON data types. Most notably, Cosmos DB lacks support for date-time data requiring that you store this data using the available data types. For instance, it can be stored as an ISO-8601 string or epoch integer. MongoDB, the database to which Cosmos DB is most often compared, extended JSON in their BSON binary serialization specification to cover date-time data as well as traditional number types, regular expressions, and Undefined. However, many argue that Cosmos DB's choice of pure JSON is actually an advantage as it's a better fit for JSON-based REST APIs and the JavaScript engine built into the database. == References == Category:Document-oriented databases Category:Microsoft cloud services Category:NoSQL ","title":"Cosmos DB"},{"id":"46415744","text":"Hieronymus Rorarius (Girolamo Rorario), (Pordenone 1485-Pordenone 1556) was at first an envoy on behalf of Charles V of Habsburg, and then a Papal nuncio to the court of Ferdinand of Hungary.

She performed with many St. Louis-based entertainers and earned national recognition, performing in her own show at Carnegie Hall in 1985. She was one of the pioneer black announcers on St. Louis radio and was the feature of a documentary about her life created by Chicago TV channel 28. She sang in several movies, including Say Amen, Somebody (1982), a documentary about Willie Mae Ford Smith' life, and the HBO mini-series Angels in America. In 2015, Price made headlines when a daughter she had given birth to in 1965 and she believed to be dead made contact with her through social media. DNA evidence confirmed that Price was the mother of the woman. Price claims that a nurse told her that her baby died while in the hospital. However, hospital records and other evidence suggest that the baby was abandoned by Price at a different hospital. == Career == Price's music career began at the age of six, singing gospel music and playing piano accompaniment for her mother, Alberta (n√©e Waterford) Cooper, who sang with the Waterford Sisters and Willie Mae Ford Smith. Price graduated from Sumner High School of St. Louis in 1957 and began her own career. By 1967, she had already made recordings and was touring Missouri singing gospel songs, having recorded with artists such as Oliver Sain Skeet Rogers, Denise Thimes and other artists. Price was a pioneer of gospel radio, hosting a show on KIRL, and along with other black announcers including Columbus Gregory, Wynetta Lindsey, Steve Love, Leonard Morris, Dean Strong and Ruby Summerville-Dickson \\"played a significant role in the development of St. Louis black radio.\\" She later starred in a television special on Chicago's TV channel 28, which documented her life and work. Price was a featured singer in the music documentary Say Amen, Somebody. The 1982 documentary also features The Barrett Sisters, Thomas A. Dorsey, Willie Mae Ford Smith, Sallie Martin and The O'Neal Twins. Price sang an emotional rendition of her song \\"I'm His Child\\" in the film, which later appeared on the 1990 soundtrack album for Glee. Her performance was praised by Chicago Sun- Times, Cosmopolitan Magazine and Rolling Stone. She was selected to play Ethel Waters in a film of Waters' life, and she sang \\"Happy I'm His Child\\", written by Malcolm Speed in the Emmy Award-winning HBO mini-series Angels in America, which starred Al Pacino and Meryl Streep. Price's performed in 1985 at Carnegie Hall in New York City, with her long-time accompanist Michael Johnson. Another was a 2009 performance for Black History Month at Powell Hall with the Saint Louis Symphony to honor blues legend . ==Personal life== In April 2015, Price met her daughter, Melanie Diane Gilmore, for the first time as an adult, in the presence of mainstream news broadcasters. Gilmore made contact with Price after her daughters were searching for their biological grandparents online. DNA results have confirmed the relationship between Price and her daughter. Price claimed that she was told her daughter had died within three hours of birth in 1965. Hospital records show that Price delivered the baby at a different hospital than she later claimed and that she abandoned her baby. Hospital records show staff tried to contact Price and even visited her and other family members on a number of occasions. The adoptive family that raised the baby also claims they reached out to Price years later and she denied having a daughter. U.S. Attorney Richard Callahan after an investigation found no evidence to support Price's claims. Despite the evidence, Price maintains her claim that a nurse told her that the baby was dead and that her baby was stolen. ==Discography== * Say Amen, Somebody (soundtrack, 1990) ==ReferencesCategory:1940s births Category:Living people Category:American gospel singers Category:Musicians from St. Louis Category:Radio personalities from St. Louis ","title":"Zella Jackson Price"},{"id":"46416012","text":"George Cyril Allen(28 June 1900 ‚Äì 31 July 1982), published as G.

Common themes in her works include women's issues, lesbianism and feminist politics. ==Career== Svedberg was born in 1934 in Halmstad, and moved to Malm√∂ with her family in 1941. Svedberg's first novel, V√•rvinterdagbok (translated as Late Winter Diary or Journal of Early Spring), was published in 1957. The book was well received, and one critic wrote: \\"The promise in Annakarin Svedberg's book above all lies in the linguistic purity of her wit, which sparkles like the late winter sun through her window, in the grace of her phrases, in the exquisite taste she demonstrates in every passage.\\" She published her second novel, Ack, denna sj√§l! (Yea, this soul!) in 1958. In 1962, Svedberg published Vingklippta (Wing-clipped), her third novel and her first piece of writing about lesbianism. The book, which presents a positive depiction of a lesbian relationship, was considered a Beat novel and drew comparisons to Jack Kerouac, Jackson Pollock, Henry Miller and Selma Lagerl√∂f. She followed Vingklippta with three more novels about lesbians: Det goda livet (1963; The Good Life), Se uppf√∂r trollen! eller: √Ñntligen en bok om livet s√•dant det verkligen √§r (1963; Watch out for the Trolls! or: Finally a Book on Life as It Is), and Din egen (1966; Your Own). Svedberg depicted homosexuality as no different from heterosexuality, although her lesbian characters often faced prejudice and injustice. Literary critic Jenny Bj√∂rklund wrote in Lesbianism in Swedish Literature: An Ambiguous Affair that Svedberg's writings \\"contribute[d] to opening up discursive space for a more tolerant attitude to lesbianism\\". In the 1960s Svedberg also authored a famous short story, a pornographic parody of Little Red Riding Hood. She published K√§rlek √§r det innersta av hj√§rtat (Love is the Core of the Heart), a book in the form of a diary, in 1976. Two years later, she wrote En enda jord, an academic book about religious values held by different cultures. Her work gradually became more political and focused on feminist ideas, and she was a contributor to the radical feminist magazine Kvinnobulletinen. In 1985 she helped to found Kvinnopartiet (The Women's Party), a short-lived radical feminist political party in Sweden. She self-published the book Sex Kristalliska Ber√§ttelser in 1994, and since the late 1990s has written numerous books about travel and spirituality. ==Personal life== Svedberg has two children with Frank Scott, a singer from the United States with whom she lived in the late 1950s. == Bibliography == * V√•rvinterdagbok 1957 * Ack, denna sj√§l! 1958 * Vingklippta 1962 * Det goda livet 1963 * Se upp f√∂r trollen! 1963 * Din egen 1966 * Sagor vid kanten av ingenting 1975 * K√§rlek √§r det innersta av hj√§rtat 1976 * En enda jord 1978 * Indira Gandhi-en bok om k√§rlek 1980 * Sex kristalliska ber√§ttelser 1994 * H√∂gplat√•ns guld 2001 * Drakflygarna 2002 * Mot k√§llan 2002 * Fem dr√∂mska sagor 2003 * Veo ad Gax fr√•n yttre rymden 2004 ==References== Category:Living people Category:1934 births Category:Swedish women writers Category:Swedish women novelists Category:Swedish feminists Category:Swedish spiritual writers Category:People from Halmstad Category:People from Malm√∂ Category:Feminist writers ","title":"Annakarin Svedberg"},{"id":"46416031","text":"The Zelennikovskaya narrow-gauge railway is located in Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia.

However, Batsa was subsequently re-admitted to the CPP and made principal research officer at the Bureau of African Affairs. For a while he was editor of the monthly Voice of Africa. In December 1962 Nkrumah made him editor of The Spark, an intellectual magazine established to \\"spell out the content of socialism\\". The Spark criticized the idea of \\"African socialism\\", attempting to enunciate a properly \\"scientific socialism\\" for an African context. In November 1963 Batsa also became Secretary-General of the Pan-African Union of Journalists (PAUJ). After Nkrumah's fall from power, Batsa moved away from socialism towards capitalism. He returned to politics as an aide to Hilla Limann's 1979‚Äì81 government.

The enclos paroissial comprises the parish church of Notre-Dame, a triumphal arch and enclosure wall, an ossuary and the famous calvary (Calvary at Saint-Th√©gonnec). It is a listed historical monument. Eglise Notre-Dame There is a second calvary set into the enclosure wall and the war memorial dedicated to those lost in the 1914-1918 war is also set into another section of the wall. On 8 June 1998, a fire destroyed a part of the north aisle and an extensive programme of restoration was finished in 2005. The Gothic bell-tower and Renaissance tower dates from 1563 and was finished in 1626. The porch has a sculpture depicting Saint Th√©gonnec in the attire of a bishop and inside the porch, statues of some of the apostles lead towards the door into the church. The church has a rood screen and in the choir area the stained glass is by Jean-Louis Nicolas and dates to 1862-1863. ==History of the church== The western Beaumanoir type bell-tower porch dates to 1563 and the monumental entrance was completed in 1587. Between 1589 and 1610 the bell-tower was improved and crowned with lanterons in 1626. The church bells are dated 1599 and 1605 and a sun-dial dates to 1606. Between 1640 and 1652 the north aisle was built by Paul Pr√©diry and Mathurin Renault, master masons, and the fenestration came from the workshop of Jean Le Bescont and were transported from Landerneau to Saint-Th√©gonnec and erected in 1651. The south aisle was reconstructed from 1653 to 1658 by Yves Le Bescont. The church was enlarged between 1667 and 1669, the apse being moved by several feet, this work being executed by Guillaume Pl√©dran and in 1670 the western part of the nave was raised to accommodate the installation of the organ. From 1686 to 1690, the architect Guillaume Le Taoc rebuilt the sacristy to the north of the choir. Between 1713 and 1714 further modifications were carried out under the direction of the Brest architect, Etienne Le Marchand. ==The Triumphal arch== The central arch of the enclos entrance at Saint-Th√©gonnec. Note at the top of the central arch the triangular topped niche with a depiction of the Holy Father giving a blessing. Below this we can see the two canons and the empty niches decorated at the top with Coquille Saint-Jacques shells Made from granite quarried from Ploun√©our-M√©nez, this elaborate Renaissance style entrance to the enclos paroissial is attributed to the masons of the nearby Ch√¢teau de Kerjean's workshop. Four massive pillars, topped with cubic lanterons, form three entrances, with the central section forming an arch. Statues of the Archangel Gabriel and the Virgin Mary seated at a prie-dieu, depict the Annunciation and decorate the structure which has four niches decorated with carvings of shells these separated by pilasters and dominated by two canons. There is also a sculpture depicting Saint Th√©gonnec riding an ass. A sculpture depicting the Holy Father is contained in a triangular topped niche at the top of the central arch. The two side entrances have stiles to stop animals accessing the enclos and the central arch has iron gates.

Above the porch is a statue of Saint Th√©gonnec and the side buttresses have niches containing Roland Dor√© (sculptor) statues depicting the Annunciation, John the Evangelist and Saint Nicolas. Inside the bell-tower porch are statues of four of the apostles, also by Dor√©, and over the entrance door to the church itself there is a statue of the Virgin Mary with child. The John the Evangelist statue carries the inscription In the Annunciation group, the pedestal of the statue of the angel is inscribed \\"Y GUILLERM\\" and that of the Virgin Mary \\"G POULIQUEN\\". The statue of Saint John inside the porch is inscribed \\"IAN GVILLOME\\", that of Saint James the Greater is inscribed \\"S JACQ H,MAZE et JACQUES PICARD\\", Saint Thomas carries a phylactery reading \\"CARNIS RESURRECTIONEM\\" and just to the left \\"Y.RIVOAL 1632.\\" Dor√© of course added the iconic \\"La d√©rision du Christ\\" to the Saint-Th√©gonnec calvary.

In the niche itself is a depiction of the Virgin Mary surrounded by a representation of the Tree of Jesse. The branches of the tree can be seen below the Virgin Mary and as they spread upwards on the left and the right we see depictions of Jesus' ancestors . On the sides of the triptych or the \\"shutters\\", are paintings depicting scenes from the life of Jesus, the annunciation, the visitation, the announcement to the shepherds, the presentation of the baby Jesus to the visitors to the stable and the adoration of the three kings.

Carvings include depictions of the cardinal virtues, the Four Evangelists with their attributes (Mark the Evangelist with lion, Matthew the Evangelist with an angel, Luke the Evangelist with an ox and John the Evangelist with an eagle, the Doctors of the church, Saint Gregory the Great, Saint Ambrose, Saint Augustine and Saint Jerome, and Moses receiving the tablets (Ten Commandments) The baroque pulpit in the Notre-Dame church at St Th√©gonnec dates to 1683 and was the work of the sculptors Fran√ßois and Guillaume Lerrel, father and son, from Landivisiau. They carved four female Caryatides representing the Cardinal virtues; Prudence, Temperance, Justice and Fortitude to support the canopy and added panels depicting the Four Evangelists with their attributes around the base. Further relief panels decorate the balustrade of the stairway these depicting the Church Fathers of the Western church, Ambrose, Jerome, Augustine and Saint Gregory the Great. He also added a relief panel depicting Moses receiving the Ten Commandments to the area between the caryatides. Many angels are included in the decoration and at the summit a \\"renomm√©\\" stands a foot poised on a globe and playing a trumpet. The sounding board (\\"l'abat-voix\\") is positioned behind the pulpit and dates to 1722.

Here we are afforded a good view of the tableau showing Moses receiving the ten commandments ==Altarpiece of \\"Saint-Sacrement\\"== View of Saint-Sacrement altarpiece The altarpiece above the altar of Saint-Sacrement, today the altar of Sacr√©-Coeur, was the work of Gabriel Carquain and was originally made in 1662 for the master-altar. It was placed in its present location in 1724 but after various additions. The subject of the altarpiece is the adoration of Jesus by the angels and a painting depicts the nativity and in the corners of the altar are statues of the Virgin Mary and Saint Th√©gonnec. ==The \\"Rosary\\" altarpiece (Retable du Rosaire)== The \\"Rosary\\" altarpiece. Notre-Dame Church in Saint-Th√©gonnec, Finist√®re, Bretagne, France. Commissioned in 1697 to Jacques Laispagnol and gilded in 1700 by Gilles Bunel, both from Morlaix. In the upper section the statue of Saint Louis is on the left and an angel with a child on the right, these statues on either side of a tableau depicting purgatory. In the lower section are statues of Saint Paull and Saint Jaoua with the tableau depicting the Virgin Mary handing down the rosary to Saint Dominic and Catherine of Siena in the centre The \\"Rosary\\" altarpiece is located in the north transept. The lower section dates from 1696 to 1698 and was the work of Jacques Lespaignol with gilding being carried out in 1700 by Gilles Brunel a Morlaix master gilder. It was enlarged in 1734 by a Guimilliau carpenter Jean Laurent who created the upper section. In 1697 official approval was given to replace the existing Rosary altarpiece as the parishioners thought it too modest. Sculptors in Quimper, Morlaix and other locations were consulted and Jacques Lespaignol, the main sculptor used by the parish of Saint-Melaine, was given the commission. A Morlaix painter called Alain Bourriquen was commissioned to execute the tableau in the centre of the altarpiece and Gilles Bunol, a master gilder from Morlaix was charged with the altarpiece's gilding. Lespaignol was commissioned to execute the altarpiece from dry oak (\\"bois de ch√™ne sec\\") and the various statues from chestnut (\\"Bois de ch√¢taigne\\"). The columns were to be in black marble. The sculptural work and the gilding were finished in 1700. The planned statue of John the Evangelist was not proceeded with and a statue of Saint Jaoua was executed instead. The final altarpiece comprises a lower and an upper section. In the lower section are the statues of Saint Paul and Saunt Jaoua with the central tableau depicting the Virgin Mary, Saint Dominic and Catherine of Siena. The upper section of the altarpiece has a statue of Saint Louis and an angel holding the hand of a child and in the centre of this upper section there is a second tableau depicting purgatory; Christ, surrounded by angels, receives the souls which Saint Dominic and Catherine of Sienna have rescued from the flames of purgatory. The Holy Father is depicted at the very top of the altarpiece.

The latter was destroyed in the 1998 fire but a complete replica was made. The original statue of the Virgin Mary dated to 1668 and was attributed to Guillaume Bourricquen and the altarpiece also has a tableau depicting the Assumption with the Virgin Mary accompanied by angels.

The architecture is exuberant, with bell-turrets, windows and slender columns. At the front of the building there is a statue of Saint Pol Aur√©lien with the dragon he had captured and with two \\"termes gain√©\\" on either side (also by Jean Le Bescont) and a silver Virgin Mary can be seen on the top of the roof by a small bell-tower. Inside the ossuary there is a 1685 altarpiece dedicated to Saint Joseph and in the crypt there is a spectacular \\"mise au Tombeau\\" by the sculptor Jacques Lespagnol. This \\"mise au tombeau\\" comprises a group of baroque polychromed sculptures carved from oak, depicting Jesus' body being prepared for burial. It was sculpted between 1699 and 1702 by the Morlaix sculptor Jacques Lespagnol. Lespagnol also worked on the church's \\"Rosary\\" altarpiece. In the \\"mise au tombeau\\", Lespagnol depicts eleven people expressing their emotions when confronted with death. We see Mary Salome and Mary Magdalene kneeling and then surrounding the corpse and from left to right, Nicodemus, Saint Veronica holding up her veil, the Virgin Mary, John the Evangelist, an angel holding a chalice and Joseph of Arimathea.

There is no altarpiece as this would have covered the windows but lavish wood-carvings surround the three windows and decorate the north and south sections of the choir area. Olivier Lespaignol of Morlaix is credited with having carved the works on the evangelist side of the altar, working on designs by Jean Hergouarc'h and the work on the epistle side is credited to Guillaume Gu√©rin from Br√©l√©v√©nez and subsequently Yves Le Goff from Brest working on the designs of Robelin. This work was completed between 1724 and 1732. ==The legend of Saint Th√©gonnec== According to legend, Saint Th√©gonnec, who originally came from Wales and was a disciple of Saint Pol Aur√©lien, had tamed a stag and used it to pull his cart which carried stones to build the church he was constructing. One day a wolf attacked and ate the stag but Saint Th√©gonnec preached to the wolf and persuaded it to replace the stag and pull the cart. Depictions of Saint Th√©gonnec therefore usually portray him accompanied by a stag or a wolf. ==Wood carvings in the choir== These were executed in two stages. In the years 1724 to 1725 the carvings on the evangelist side of the choir were executed by Olivier Lespaignol of Morlax based on the drawings of the architect Boismaurin and between 1730 and 1732 the carvings on the epistle side were firstly the work of Guillaume Gu√©rin who was based in Br√©l√©venez and then by Herv√© Le Goff of Brest based on the designs of Robelin. ==The 1998 fire== On 8 June 1998 the church suffered a bad although accidental fire which devastated the north wing and despite the efforts of the local fire brigade and local people the north aisle of the church was destroyed including the altarpiece \\"Notre-Dame de Vray Secours\\" and the nave with the rood screen. A public appeal sought to raise funds to repair the damage and over 700 donations were recorded. Extensive restoration followed, completed in 2005. The lost altarpiece was completely and exactly replicated. ==The organ== The organ at Notre-Dame This dates from 1670 to 1676 and was made by Jacques Mascard who was a follower of Robert Dallam. ==The sacristy and the baptismal fonts== The baptismal fonts at Notre- Dame The sacristy was constructed in 1686 by a team of workers led by Guillaume Le Tauc. The master carpenter was a Paul Le Goff. The baptismal fonts are located by the \\"chapelle des Tr√©pass√©s\\". ==Stained glass== The windows in the Notre=Dame church are by Jean-Louis Nicolas of Morlaix and date from 1862 to 1868. ==Statuary== The church is rich in statuary. This includes:- 1\\\\. A \\"poutre de gloire\\" or rood depicting Christ on the cross, the Virgin Mary and John the Evangelist. This was badly damaged in the fire but has been replaced. What was rescued from the fire of the original \\"poutre de gloire\\" is also displayed on the church walls. 2\\\\. In the south aisle statues of Saint Christopher, Saint Roch and Saint Sebastian. 3\\\\. A statue depicting the Virgin Mary with her mother. Some photographs are shown below.

L'√âglise et ses annexes\\" The √âglise de Saint-Th√©gonnec, given the classification of a \\"monument historiques\\" by the \\"Commission des Beaux-Arts\\" in 1886, has undergone many changes since its original construction and now has three naves with seven columns and ten arcades. In the 18th-century, two doorways were created at the base of the bell-tower to allow processions easy access to the church but this change was subsequently reversed at the insistence of the \\"Commission des Beaux-Arts\\". Further details of modifications made to the church and other details are given in the excellent book \\"SAINT- TH√âGONNEC-L‚Äô√©glise et ses annexes\\" by the Abb√© F. QUINIOU, a vicar of Saint- Th√©gonnec written in 1909 and published by F.Paillart.

Amongst the best known are those at Luzec dating to 1864, the Croas-Calafres or Bod√©riny dating to 1632 and that at Broustou which dates to 1662. ==The Sainte-Brigitte chapel== There is also a small chapel in Saint-this dedicated to sainte Brigitte, not to the Irish Brigitte, the abbess of Kildare, as is normally the case in Brittany, but Brigitte de Su√®de who lived from 1303 to 1373. The chapel was built in the 16th century and building continued until 1865. The chapel contains several polychromed statues including Sainte-Brigitte and two versions of the Virgin Mary with child, one showing her seated and the other showing her standing. The pardon is celebrated twice a year on the third Sunday of July and the third Sunday of August. ==See also== * List of the works of the Ma√Ætre de Th√©gonnec ==NotesReferences== Category:Churches in Finist√®re Category:Calvaries in Brittany Category:Parish closes in Brittany ","title":"Saint-Th√©gonnec Parish close"},{"id":"46416135","text":"Vincer√≤ (; \\"I will be victorious\\") is the concluding cry of the aria \\"Nessun dorma\\" from Puccini's opera Turandot.

This masala entertainer will make you fall in love with the characters and will also make sure that you fall off your seat every few minutes courtesy the heavy doses of laughter that will come your way. But be warned that if you are easily offended and rate humour as being clean or dirty then this is surely not your cup of tea.\\" Asad Haroon of Dispatch News Desk said, \\"Wrong Number is a slapstick comedy filled with humor. One can't stop laughing throughout the movie and the dialogues are pretty well written and up to the mark. The script of the movie wasn‚Äôt predictable that much but the dialogues were totally unpredictable and funny to such an extent that one could say that I didn't see that coming. The production quality of Wrong number is not that great as of Bin Roye but the screen is pretty bright of wrong number.\\" Box office The film had a 90% opening day, registering .

Together with the Rakitna tectonic block, the plateau is delineated by two distinct Dinaric faults. According to the geographer Anton Melik, the Bloke Plateau is a remnant of a Pliocene peneplain in the middle of the rejuvenated terrain. Poorly permeable karst limestone and Triassic dolomite (in the northern part of the plateau) conditioned the formation of typical surface watercourses (Blo≈°ƒçica Creek and Blatnica Creek), which are bounded by wet grasslands and minerotrophic fens. Lake Bloke (), a reservoir, lies near the settlement of Volƒçje. Water flows below ground from the Bloke Plateau into Lake Cerknica. The plateau's many hills divide it into the Blo≈°ƒçica Valley and Loƒçica Valley (or Farov≈°ƒçica Valley), which join to form the Bloke‚ÄìFara Karst Field (). There are 45 settlements on the plateau, administratively belonging to the Municipality of Bloke. The Bloke Plateau is accessible from several directions, especially from the Ljubljana and Littoral directions via the A1 Freeway and the town of Unec via Cerknica and from Lower Carniola via Ribnica and Sodra≈æica. Points of interest in the area include Cross Cave (), Lake Cerknica (), Sne≈ænik Castle (), and Rak ≈†kocjan Park (a protected landscape area; ). Geographically, the Bloke Plateau also extends to Sne≈ænik Regional Park. ==History== The Bloke Plateau was first mentioned in written documents in 1260, and its central settlement of Nova Vas in 1341. The territory was settled in the first millennium BC by the Iapydes (an Illyrian tribe). During the Roman era, a road led across the Bloke Plateau from Aquileia and the Kvarner Gulf toward the Pannonian Basin. Remains of a defense wall and a Roman tower near the village of Benete testify to this history. ==Cultural heritage== Culturally, the Bloke Plateau is known as the place where skiing originated in Slovenia,Perko, Drago, & Milan Oro≈æen Adamiƒç. 1998. Slovenija: pokrajine in ljudje. Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, p. 412. and a cross-country skiing competition is held there every year.

Thompson was born at Gulgong, New South Wales, to George Thompson and his wife Martha and educated at the Gulgong State School. He began his working career in Gulgong as an apprentice compositor, and while there he earned a reputation as a fast amateur foot runner and a fine athlete. The beginning of 1885 saw Thompson in Brisbane working for the Brisbane Courier but left to work for the Boomerang newspaper after an altercation with management. When the Boomerang ceased publication in 1891 Thompson found part- time work with the Brisbane Government Printing Office until in the early 1890s he moved over to The Worker, a newspaper with ties to the Labour Party. Blacklisted from being employed by the conservative Queensland Government in 1902, the ban was eventually lifted in 1904 and Thompson once again began work there. During Brisbane's 1912 general strike, he was one of two government employees who were refused re-employment when the strike came to its end and found work with The Daily Standard, another newspaper with ties to Labour. While there he worked his way up to overseer of the compositing room before a disagreement with the editor-manager saw him demoted to the reading room and as a result, retiring. ==Political career== Thompson's first attempt to enter Queensland Parliament came in 1902 when, as a Labour candidate, he contested the seat of Fortitude Valley, losing to fellow Labour member, Frank McDonnell. When the Labour Party starting forming governments in Queensland, it found much of its legislation being blocked by a hostile Council, where members had been appointed for life by successive conservative governments. After a failed referendum in May 1917, Premier Ryan tried a new tactic, and later that year advised the Governor, Sir Hamilton John Goold-Adams, to appoint thirteen new members whose allegiance lay with Labour to the Council.Goold-Adams, Sir Hamilton John (1858‚Äì1920) ‚Äì Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved 15 April 2015. In 1920, the new Premier Ted Theodore appointed a further fourteen new members to the Council with Thompson amongst the appointees. He served for two years until the Council was abolished in March 1922. ==Personal life== On 19 September 1888, Thompson married Margaret Ann Dunne (died 1929) at Brisbane and together had two daughters.

His mother is Swedish but his father is from Morocco. After his parents break up he and his mother moved to Lule√• while Zacke was just a few years old. == Music career == Zacke released his first EP Var h√§r in 2003 and followed that with his second EP F√§rdighaft which was produced by Emil Pettersson in 2004. Both of his EPs received good comments from critics and the track Anna p√• glej from his second EP was played on P3 for a while in 2004. In 2010 he released his first real album Visst √§r det vackert and it was a major hit and was praised by almost every reviewer. The album won the prize ‚ÄúBest hiphop‚Äù at Manifestgalan in 2011. In February 2013 Zacke released his second and his latest full length solo album Renhj√§rtat. Just like his previous album Renhj√§rtat gained good critics and Swedish music papers like Kingsize Magazine gave it 4 out of 5. Throughout his whole career Zacke has collaborated and made songs with some of Sweden's biggest artists such as Movits, Mattias Alkberg, Oskar Linnros, Timbuktu and Alexander Juneblad. His close work with the group Movits (also from Lule√•) led to a new group called Alaska started by Zacke and Johan Rensfeldt from Movits. The idea of the group was to make music that they did not think fitted their two main projects (Movits and Zacke). The duo¬¥s first album Alaska was released in the summer of 2014. Both Visst √§r det vackert and Renhj√§rtat were produced by Anders Rensfeldt from Movits. Critics have praised Zacke ever since his first release in 2003 for his way of expressing himself throughout his lyrics. == Discography ==  Albums  * 2003 ‚Äì Var h√§r (EP) * 2004 ‚Äì F√§rdighaft (EP) * 2010 ‚Äì Visst √§r det vackert * 2013 ‚Äì Renhj√§rtat * 2014 ‚Äì Alaska (with Alaska) * 2016 ‚Äì Fattigkussen  Singles  * 2008 ‚Äì BS * 2009 ‚Äì √ñppet idag * 2009 ‚Äì F√∂rlorad generation * 2009 ‚Äì Spela mig p√• radion * 2010 ‚Äì 1000-0 till idioterna * 2012 ‚Äì Mammas nya kille * 2012 ‚Äì Utomlands * 2012 ‚Äì En skata fl√∂g * 2012 ‚Äì Minicall * 2013 ‚Äì Halvv√§gs * 2015 ‚Äì Det b√∂rjar med mig (with Fatta man) * 2020 ‚Äì Solsidan == References == Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Swedish rappers Category:Swedish hip hop musicians Category:Musicians from Stockholm ","title":"Zacke"},{"id":"46416317","text":"Anthony G. Watson is a British business and technology executive, and human and LGBT rights activist. Since 2013 he has sat on the board of GLAAD. In April 2015, he joined the Bitcoin trading start-up Uphold as its president and Chief Executive Officer. He was listed 19th in Fortune's 2014 \\"40 under 40\\" list, fourth in Financial Times' 2014 list of influential LGBT executives, and 10th in The Guardian's 2014 \\"World Pride Power List\\", where he was described as \\"one of the most influential gay men in the world.\\" == Career == A Christian who studied theology, Watson initially considered becoming a minister, but discovered he enjoyed working with technology while working part-time for AOL Ireland during his degree. As a result, he started working for First-e Bancorp (Europe's first internet bank), going on to take senior roles at Microsoft, CitiGroup and Unisys. Between 2006 and 2009, he was the senior vice president and global head of technology services at Wells Fargo, where he ran technology for the bank across 44 Counties. Watson worked as chief information officer for Barclays' retail arm from 2009, overseeing the launch of several mobile apps including the bank's Pingit service for sending and receiving money, about which he said \\"The feedback we have had around Pingit in the media and on Twitter was amazing, we were in the top spot for a while with that launch, only porn stars get that sort of traffic.\\" In interviews, he reported being responsible for a ¬£3 billion annual IT budget. In February 2014, Watson left Barclays to move from the UK to the USA, where in April 2014 he begin working as chief information officer for Nike. In that role he signed a significant deal with Juniper Networks, and completed a five- year road map for IT strategy at the company. After 10 months at Nike, Watson left the company in December 2014. This was announced as being for \\"personal reasons.\\" Business Insider and Fortune both quoted unnamed sources who explained he was dissatisfied with life in Portland, Oregon, where he lived in order to work at Nike's Beaverton headquarters. However Watson has stated neither Portland nor Beaverton contributed to his decision to leave. Shortly after leaving Nike, Watson joined Uphold in April 2015 as its president and chief operating officer. The then six-month-old company allows customers to trade in Bitcoin and hold more stable investments (currency or commodities) that are denominated in Bitcoin. Watson has stated he believes the company will help make the financial system fairer, saying \\"I wanted to do something that is valuable for people broadly, not just in one industry. And what Uphold is looking to achieve really democratizes finance. It's going to help people all over the world. The financial system is inherently unfair‚Äîit's always the richest who have access, and the poorest don‚Äôt have access, or when they do, they have to pay astronomical rates.\\" Watson has also been a director of Digital Globe Services since 2013. == Activism == At Barclays, Watson was the co-chair of the bank's \\"global diversity & inclusion panel\\". In 2013 he became the first non-US citizen to join the board of directors for the LGBT charity GLAAD, and he is an ambassador for the LGBT charity Stonewall. He is a chair of the European Diversity Awards, as well as acting chair of the judges, and is a patron of the UK charity Diversity Role Models. He has spoken in schools about LGBT issues and careers. Watson came out to his family at age 21, but did not come out at work until about six years later. The Guardian quoted him saying, \\"I remember being shocked by a colleague using the term 'filthy queer' in a meeting, so much so that I had to pull him aside and say, 'I'm gay, and you don't get to use that language here. If you want to use it at home, that's your call, but in this context, you don't get to use that language.' That's actually why I came out at the time. It's important that people take a stand on these issues.\\" Fortune has described Watson as \\"an outspoken gay rights activist,\\" while The Guardian has described him as \\"one of the most influential gay men in the world.\\" == Awards and recognition == * The Telegraph 2015 \\"Out at Work\\" list of top 50 LGBT executives: ranked 4th. * Fortune 2014 \\"40 under 40\\" list of the most influential young people in business: ranked 19th. * Financial Times 2014 list of influential LGBT executives: ranked 4th. * The Guardian 2014 \\"World Pride Power List\\" of the most influential LGBT people: ranked 10th. * The Independent on Sunday 2014 \\"Rainbow List\\" of influential LGBT people: ranked 44th. * CIO UK 2014 \\"CIO 100\\" list of transformative chief information officers: ranked 14th. * Adcolor 2014 \\"Advocate\\" award for increasing awareness of LGBT causes within and without the communications industry. * Financial Times 2013 \\"OUTstanding in Business List\\" of influential LGBT people: ranked 9th. * The Guardian 2013 \\"World Pride Power List\\" of the most influential LGBT people: ranked 26th. * The Independent on Sunday 2013 \\"Pink List\\" of influential LGBT people: ranked 66th. * CIO UK 2013 \\"CIO 100\\" list of transformative chief information officers: ranked 6th. * Out in the City 2013 readers' awards: Inspirational Role Model of the Year. * The Guardian 2012 \\"World Pride Power List\\" of the most influential LGBT people: ranked 56th. * The Independent on Sunday 2012 \\"Pink List\\" of influential LGBT people: ranked 60th. * Abercrombie & Fitch 2012 \\"Diversity Champion of the Year\\" in the European Diversity Awards: shortlisted. == References  External links == * Category:Businesspeople from London Category:Nike, Inc. people Category:Barclays people Category:Living people Category:1970s births Category:LGBT businesspeople from the United Kingdom Category:Gay men Category:British chief executives Category:Chief information officers Category:21st-century Christians Category:LGBT Christians Category:English Christians Category:Alumni of Trinity College Dublin Category:University of North Carolina alumni Category:LGBT rights activists from the United Kingdom Category:British expatriates in the United States Category:Chief operating officers ","title":"Anthony G.

Established in 1994, the Council archives were housed in a single purpose- built facility in 1995, opened to the public in 1996, and made available online since 2007. The archives are open to the public and receive up to 1000 information requests a month, from Wellington City Council staff and the general public. About half of the requests are building consent searches, and up to 300 are assisting council staff preparing Land Information Memorandums (LIM). The remainder range from historical and genealogical research requests to enquiries about land history or property information. ==History== Wellington City Archivist Michelle Redward and Archives Assistant Adrian Humphris in 1995, shortly after the Archives opened ‚Äì initially there were just two staff. Wellington was the first site of local government in New Zealand, and the city's archives date back to 1842 when the Wellington Borough Council was established. As recently as 1994, council records were stored at more than 10 places around Wellington, loosely classified using a system devised in 1926. Many were housed in sub-standard conditions, at risk from temperature extremes and leaks, in breach of the Local Government Act requirements for the preservation of government archives. Some were stored below sea level in the Town Hall basement, and periodically soaked in seawater. The \\"rotting\\" documents were at risk of being lost forever, so the City Council approved relocating them to a central facility at a cost of $300,000. The Wellington City Archives were formally established in 1994, and Michelle Redward was appointed in March as Council archivist to supervise the move. The new Wellington City Archives was opened by Mayor Mark Blumsky on 26 June 1996, in an environmentally-controlled and earthquake-proof facility off Tory Street, with 5 km of shelving over 730 square metres of storage area. The Archives were expanded in 2005 to 1000 square metres, creating a work room and meeting room. In 2007, more than 370,000 collection items and 9,000 scanned images were made available online, including large numbers of digitised building permit and consent records. In 2016 the Archives partnered with information management company Techtonics to develop a new information repository, a project that won the 2017 ALGIM Information and Records Management Project of the Year award. Wellington City Archives is partnering with startup Excio to make more photographs from the collection available directly to people's mobile devices.

Laon, Abucay, Bataan, Philippines. The parish church, founded by the Dominican Missionary Friars in 1588, is dedicated to Saint Dominic of Guzman. The parish is under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Balanga. The church housed one of the earliest printing presses in the Philippines, established in 1608 by Father Francisco Blancas de San Jose, O.P. and Tomas Pinpin who used the facility to print books in Spanish and Tagalog. The church was also a witness to the massacre of hundreds of Filipinos and Spaniards by the Dutch Invaders on June 23, 1647. These pieces of the church's history were inscribed on a historical marker installed by the National Historical Committee (now the National Historical Commission of the Philippines) in 1939. ==History== Parish church history The church structure was erected by Father Geronimo de Belen in the early 1600s after the establishment of the Dominican mission in Abucay on June 10, 1588. On June 23, 1647, the Dutch Naval Forces who invaded Manila and its neighboring provinces massacred hundreds of Kapampangans and Spanish officials and priests in the church complex, while others were taken to Batavia, a former Dutch colony. The current church was significantly damaged by an earthquake on September 16, 1852. Major changes were made into the structure before the Second World War, as stated in a medallion placed on top of the church's main portal with the inscription \\"Mayo de 1925 \\". Abucay Printing Press The Spanish religious missionaries to the Philippines did not bring with them equipment for mass production of books and manuscripts. Instead, they employed the knowledge of the Chinese in the country to construct the first printing press. This first printing press used xylography, a type of relief printing technique with letters or characters etched on blocks of wood. One of the first books printed in the country using the technique is the Doctrina Christiana, a catechetical book meant to educate the local population on the Roman catholic religion, with hymns and prayers written in the local language (Tagalog) and script (Baybayin). Texts produced with the press from 1593 to 1610 used the local language and writing system but by 1604, the Spanish started printing using movable type with Roman letters. Father Francisco Blancas de San Jose, a Dominican Friar was a key figure in this shift from local to Romanized text. By 1608, the printing press which used to be in Manila, was transferred to Abucay in Bataan province. Filipinos replaced the Chinese men as workers in the printing press. Tomas Pinpin, a local of Abucay, is recognized as the first Filipino printer. Among Pinpin's publications was a manual teaching Tagalog speakers the Spanish language. This manual was printed by Diego Talaghay (believed to be his assistant) when Pinpin was appointed as shop manager. ==Architecture== The two-level facade of the church is described as of Renaissance style. Its expanse is divided vertically by single or coupled Doric columns. The two saints' niches flanking the main portal, three fenestrations on the second level, and the saint's niche on the center of the pediment are all topped by triangular pediments, each with a pair of decorative brackets to support it. Four urn-like finials top the second-level cornice. The triangular pediment, with its top lined with balusters, undulates down to its base. To the right of the church rises the five-tiered bell tower, with each of its storey defined by decorative balusters and ornamented with semicircular arched windows. ==See also== * Education in the Philippines during Spanish rule * Roman Catholicism in the Philippines * Roman Catholic Diocese of Balanga * Balanga Cathedral ==References Category:Roman Catholic churches in Bataan Category:Spanish Colonial architecture in the Philippines Category:Baroque architecture in the Philippines Category:1588 establishments in the Spanish Empire ","title":"Abucay Church"},{"id":"46416513","text":"Knights is an arcade game released in 1994 as public domain freeware by Kalle Marjola for the Commodore International Amiga home computer.

It consists of a single nectophore (swimming bell), the exterior of which has five complete longitudinal ridges, the bases of which bend dorsally. The hydroecium (ventral cavity) is shallow and the somatocyst (part of the gastrovascular system) extends to about half the height of the nectophore. The eudoxid stage (reproductive element) is indistinguishable from that of M. atlantica. ==Distribution and habitat== Muggiaea kochii is found in the neritic zone on both sides of the warm temperate and subtropical Atlantic Ocean. It is present on the Gulf Coast of the United States where it often occurs in brackish water in bays. In the Mediterranean Sea it is often most abundant in the period April to June, but this varies from year to year. It also occurs in the Adriatic Sea where it was joined in the 1990s by the non-native M. atlantica. This species was first detected in the marine lakes on the island of Mljet in southern Croatia in 2001, and since then, seems to have displaced M. kochii in the Great Lake there. In the Atlantic Ocean, the ranges of M. kochii and M. atlantica only overlap to a limited extent; where one is abundant, the other tends to be uncommon. M. kochii is a warm-temperate species, being found between 48¬∞N and 36¬∞S, while M. atlantica is a cool-temperate species occurring between 55¬∞N and 37¬∞S. ==Ecology== Muggiaea kochii feeds mostly on copepods while predators such as hyperiid amphipods feed on M. kochii. Reproduction in Muggiaea kochii is by an alternation of generations between an asexual polygastric form (bearing both asexual and reproductive elements) and the sexual eudoxid form which becomes separated from the nectophore. The complete cycle takes two weeks at and three weeks at . When the water temperature falls to , the animal becomes lethargic and unmoving. ==References== Category:Siphonophorae Category:Animals described in 1844 ","title":"Muggiaea kochii"},{"id":"46416633","text":"The British Empire Building, also known by its address 620 Fifth Avenue, is a 6-story retail building located on the west side of Fifth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. Completed in 1934, the structure is part of Rockefeller Center, and was built in the Art Deco style. ==Construction== Fifth Avenue facade The building was part of the original construction of the Rockefeller Center, with an oval-shaped retail building originally planned for the block. The oval building was scrapped in early 1931, and an updated plan proposed a tall 41-story tower and two smaller 6-story retail buildings on the site of the oval building. Because the canceled oval building had contained rooftop gardens, Raymond Hood suggested the idea for rooftop gardens across the complex, including on all of the retail buildings. These gardens would be curated by Ralph Hancock. As American tenants were reluctant to rent in these retail buildings, Rockefeller Center's manager Hugh Robertson, formerly of Todd, Robertson and Todd, suggested foreign tenants for the buildings. The first themed building that was agreed on was the British Empire Building, the more southerly of the two buildings, which would host the governmental and commercial ventures of the United Kingdom. The cornerstone of the British Empire Building was laid in June, when Francis Hopwood, 1st Baron Southborough, placed the symbolic first stone in a ceremony. The British Building's structural steel started construction in October of that year. The British Empire Building opened by early May 1934. ==Description== The British Empire Building is located north of its architectural twin, La Maison Francaise. It is a six-story standalone building with a limestone facade with a sixth-story setback, as well as a partial -story penthouse on the west half of the seventh story and a garden on the east side of the seventh-story roof. The Channel, a , planted pedestrian esplanade, separates the British Empire Building and La Maison Francaise. The British Empire Building contains ground-level storefronts on all four sides and a cornerstone inscribed with the building's name. The British Empire Building commissioned artists who were both British and non-British. As Britain did not have a good economy at the time due to the reduction of its empire in previous years, most of the artwork in the building focused on the empire itself rather than its artistic contribution. Carl Paul Jennewein, an American of German descent, created nine gold-leaf figures on three distinct panels above the entrance signifying different parts of the empire; these panels visually underscored the divisions in the triple-paneled doorway below. Jennewein also created a cartouche that depicts authentic British motifs combined in a single fictional coat of arms. Rene Chambellan designed the bas- reliefs on the sixth floor of this building, consisting of motifs modeled on the coats of arms of England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. On the secondary entrances, Lee Lawrie placed decorations signifying symbols of the empire's power, such as Tudor roses, gilded passant guardant lions, and the wing-footed god of commerce, Mercury. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission added landmark status to the exteriors of all the original Rockefeller Center's buildings in 1985. In its approval of the complex's status, the commission wrote, \\"Rockefeller Center ranks among the grandest architectural projects ever undertaken in the United States\\". The roof gardens of the wings were restored in 1986 for $48,000 each. ==ReferencesSources== # # # # Category:Rockefeller Center Category:Fifth Avenue Category:1934 establishments in New York (state) Category:Retail buildings in New York (state) ","title":"British Empire Building"},{"id":"46416636","text":"H·ªì ƒê·ª©c Ho√† (born 1974) is a community organizer and journalist who has been arrested in Vietnam and sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2013. __NOTOC__ == 2011 Arrest == H·ªì ƒê·ª©c Ho√† is known for being a contributing journalist for the Vietnam Redemptorist News and for actively mobilizing access to education for children living in poverty and assistance to typhoon victims and people living with disabilities.

All human rights defenders were sentenced to 3 to 13 years in charges of subversion. During the court case, Hoa was accused of involved in a training session organised by Viet Tan, a US-based pro-democracy organization to establish democracy and reform Vietnam through peaceful and political means. Along with Dang Xuan Dieu and Paulus Le Son, Hoa was convicted to 13 years in prison followed by 5 years in house arrest.

The Embassy of the United States in Vietnam said that they were \\"deeply troubled\\" following the conviction of the activists over the two-day trial.

He was also the founder of the Figlie di Nostra Signora del Giardino and the Missionaries of Saint Alphonsus. Gianelli was dedicated to the educational needs of his people and catered to their spiritual and material needs as well; he was on hand to aid the ill and the poor and made evangelization a focus to his episcopal mission. He likewise preached missions and became known for his charisma and his eloquence. Gianelli's beatification was celebrated in 1925 and he was later canonized as a saint in late 1951. Since 4 June 2000 he has been the patron saint for both Bobbio and Val di Vara. ==Life== Tomb in the Bobbio duomo. Antonio Maria Gianelli was born on 12 April 1789 - on Easter Sunday - to Giacomo and Maria Gianelli; he had five brothers. His mother often taught people catechism and his father was known for his efforts in peace- making in their town. He grew up in a small village of farmers and he was an exceptional student - so much so that the owner of the farm he lived on - Nicoletta Rebizzo - paid for his studies for the priesthood. He commenced those studies in November 1807 in Genoa where he began his studies in dogmatics and liturgical practice and earned his doctorate. He had been made a subdeacon in September 1811 and was granted the rather unusual privilege of being allowed to preach while still a subdeacon due to his exceptional eloquence being a well-noted fact. The Cardinal Archbishop of Genoa Giuseppe Maria Spina ordained him to the diaconate in mid-1812. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1812 (in Genoa at the church of Nostra Signora del Carmine) and had to receive special dispensation since he was not at the canonical age required for ordination. Gianelli celebrated his first Mass in Cerreta. He served as a parish priest in Mantua after he was ordained. Spina sent Gianelli in 1812 to teach at Carcare in Savona. In February 1813 he was made the vice- parish priest of the San Matteo church in Genoa and on 23 May 1814 joined the Congregation of the Suburban Missionaries of Genoa. From September 1815 until 1817 he served as a professor at the college of the Padri Scolopi in Carcare before becoming a professor of rhetoric in November 1816 in Genoa. He remained there until 1822 when he was granted another position that he would hold for a decade. His future students included the future Archbishop of Genoa Salvatore Magnasco and Giuseppe Frassinetti. Gianelli was made the archpriest of the church of Saint John the Baptist in Chiavari on 21 June 1826 after Luigi Lambruschini appointed him to that position; he held that position until 1837. From November 1826 he taught in Chiavari teaching his studies theological subjects as well as Latin and Greek. He was the founder of the Missionaries of Saint Alphonsus in 1827 for men and that order lasted from that point to 1856 while the Oblates of Saint Alphonsus lasted from its founding in 1828 until 1848 when it had to be dissolved. He also founded the Figlie di Nostra Signora del Giardino on 12 January 1829. It was a teaching order for females that worked with the sick. The order received formal papal approval from Pope Leo XIII on 7 June 1882 which came a few decades after Gianelli's death. Pope Gregory XVI appointed him as the Bishop of Bobbio in 1837 and he received his episcopal consecration after his appointment. He had been preaching a mission in February 1838 when he learned that the appointment had been made. He restored devotion to Saint Columbanus in his diocese and conducted two diocesan synods. He visited each parish in his diocese on a regular basis. Gianelli spent long periods in the confessional in order to accommodate the endless stream of people seeking absolution. In April 1845 he started to show signs of tuberculosis that had not been diagnosed from the onset; he spent the next month in recuperation where he seemed to regain his strength for a time. He seemed to recover during this period but his illness returned in the spring of 1846 and his condition started to deteriorate at a rapid pace. He died on 7 June 1846 due to a serious fever combined with the tuberculosis; he had been recuperating in Piacenza at the time. His order still continues its work in Europe and Asia and has also expanded to the United States of America. On 21 October 2001 a statue made out of white Carrara marble was dedicated to him. ==Sainthood== The cause for sainthood commenced under Pope Leo XIII on 2 June 1896 which gave him the title of Servant of God. Pope Benedict XV recognized his life of heroic virtue and declared him to be Venerable on 11 April 1920. Pope Pius XI beatified him on 19 April 1920 and Pope Pius XII canonized him in Saint Peter's Basilica on 21 October 1951. Pope John Paul II - in an address to Gianelli's order on 17 February 2003 - recalled the saint for his \\"burning desire to belong to Christ\\" and hailed him for his dedication to evangelization and preaching. Patronage Since 4 June 2000 Bishop Antonio Maria Gianelli has been the patron saint for both Bobbio and Val di Vara. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * ==External links== * Hagiography Circle * Saints SQPN * Catholic Hierarchy * Gianelline Category:1789 births Category:1846 deaths Category:19th-century Christian saints Category:19th- century Italian people Category:19th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:19th-century venerated Christians Category:Beatifications by Pope Pius XI Category:Canonizations by Pope Pius XII Category:19th-century deaths from tuberculosis Category:Founders of Catholic religious communities Category:Italian beatified people Category:Italian clergy Category:Italian Roman Catholic bishops Category:Italian Roman Catholic saints Category:Italian venerated Catholics Category:Venerated Catholics ","title":"Antonio Maria Gianelli"},{"id":"46416666","text":"The Tasmanian Northern Midlands is an interim Australian bioregion located in northern midlands region of Tasmania, comprising . ==See also== * Ecoregions in Australia * Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia * Regions of Tasmania ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Thackway, R and I D Cresswell (1995) An interim biogeographic regionalisation for Australia : a framework for setting priorities in the National Reserves System Cooperative Program Version 4.0 Canberra : Australian Nature Conservation Agency, Reserve Systems Unit, 1995.

She is a retired professor of virology from the University of Bologna, located in Italy. ==Education and research== Gabriella Camapadelli-Fiume completed her doctorate of science (Sc.D.) at the University of Bologna, Italy. Her specialization in virology was also completed at the University of Bologna. Campadelli-Fiume primarily researches Herpes simplex virus (HSV), particularly how it enters, assembles, and exits the cell during an infection. In addition, she is interested in how HSV is induced to enter the exocytic pathway. ==Primary focus== Varicella- zoster Virus (5614251360) *HSV entry into the cell *Viral assembly in cell *HSV exit out of the cell *Viral induced alteration of exocytic pathway Herpes simplex virus Herpes simplex virus consists of two types: *Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) : *Transmitted by oral contact, causes orolabial herpes (cold sores) and genital herpes : *HSV-1 is the most common infection through the world.

She also discovered the triggering activity of receptor- bound gD. In addition to these major discoveries, she identified the gF profusion domain, which provided the first evidence that retargeted HSVs exert anti-tumor activity. Additional contributions to virology Gabriella Campadelli-Fiume took part in a study showing that glycoproteins gD, gB, and gH/gL permit herpes virus to enter cells and were involved in fusion. Their research indicated that gD is not required for the interactions between the glycoproteins gB and gH/gL. Rather, their interactions are made possible due to the multiple sites carried by gB. The multiple sites of gB can be found in the pleckstrin-domain that carries the bipartite fusion loop, and interaction with gH/gL can take place successfully without gD. == Influence== Women have made significant progress towards equality within scientific fields of work. However, as efforts to increase women's participation in science fields, inequality exists. Furthermore, an underrepresented group of women remain in these fields. Campadelli-Fiume is an influential woman who continues to bridge the gender gap within the scientific community. Her achievements throughout her career have earned substantial amounts of attention and credible recognition globally. As the author of an overall encyclopedic of basic virology and clinical manifestations, Human Herpesviruses, her work has been included in the University of Pennsylvania‚Äôs 2007 Celebration of Women Writers. She has gained recent attention for applaudable women in science by the International Society of Antiviral Research (ISAR) that has featured her as a prominent woman scientist. The American Academy of Microbiology awarded recognition of her scientific achievement and her contributions to advanced microbiology. Campadelli‚Äôs profound research, leadership principles, scientific achievements, and passion for virology, continue to convey a powerful impression to those within the scientific community.

The design is currently the main product offering of Scomi Rail, which has won several contracts with the design, with the first customer being the Mumbai Monorail project. == Background == In late 2006, Scomi Rail decided to develop its own next generation monorail after gaining experience from the manufacture of the KL Monorail system. Within twelve months after commencing engineering design, on 26 November 2007, the SUTRA was unveiled by the then Malaysian deputy prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak, who described the launch as \\"a significant milestone\\". The total investment expenditure spent by Scomi Rail for the SUTRA monorail was about RM35mil including for research, development and factory expansion. == Design == The SUTRA complies with 50 international standards comprising safety, quality assurance, vehicle certification, reliability, availability and maintainability. Compared to the previous design used in the KL Monorail, the SUTRA has improved features such as a composite body and interior panel, new bogie system and structure, mass transit components drive train, improved propulsion and control system, and regenerative and pneumatic brake system. The SUTRA is also more energy-efficient due to an improved direct-drive propulsion system and lower vehicle weight. The SUTRA also has a smaller turning radius of 50mhttp://greg-vassilakos.com/monospec/monospec.htm and can also handle gradients on a slope of up to six degrees. The SUTRA also features couplings for up to eight cars that have a capacity of 1,050 passengers.  General  The Scomi SUTRA being manufactured The SUTRA is a highly customisable design, and is designed to accommodate two to eight cars per set, with capacity ranging from 6,400 pphpd in the four-car KL Monorail to 36,000 in the 5/6-car Line 17 (S√£o Paulo Metro) and Manaus Monorail. The monocoque (load-bearing single-shell frame) body structure of the SUTRA is constructed with aluminium extrusion materials. The lightweight structure combined with the aluminium apron structure provides enhanced strength and durability of up to 30 years. The SUTRA's propulsion is provided by an electric motor with gear reducers which draws power from the 750 VDC power line. The motor of the SUTRA is fitted with a Variable Voltage Variable Frequency (VVVF) drive which is fine-tuned for smooth acceleration / deceleration. The VVVF has high torque and duty cycle capabilities, rated at a power of 200 kW. The brake system consists of electro-pneumatic systems and regenerative brakes, providing multiple uses including high integrity emergency brakes, service brakes, security brakes and parking brakes. The SUTRA has an automatic coupling system that can connect up to eight cars together. The coupling system is also capable of towing another SUTRA during emergency connections and is also designed to absorb impact energy in case of accidents.  Interior  The interior of the SUTRA is customisable, and was designed with the consideration of passenger safety and comfort. It was designed with a minimalist concept with the aim of increased interior space and maximised flow of passengers and minimised obstruction in and around doorways. Hand rails and stanchions are available to assist safe boarding, seating, standing and alighting assistance, including for persons with disabilities. Other safety features include an emergency door release knob and emergency passenger intercom as well as emergency ventilation windows. The flooring of the SUTRA is slip-resistant and made of fire-retardant material. Each car has a 40 kW roof mounted air conditioning unit. Passenger information systems include LED texts and television screens in addition to audio announcements. The cabs are equipped with specially designed mass transit seats and two adjacent flippable seats as well as a disabled wheelchair area, which also functions as a standing area when not utilised. Similar to the previous generation Scomi monorails, there are center seats which also function as bogie covers.  Vehicle management  Driver's cab of the SUTRA with the vehicle management system visible The vehicle management system (VMS) provides supervised control, monitoring and diagnostic systems for train operators. Train status information is graphically displayed to the operator via the HMI panel. The user-friendly interface display allows the operator to quickly respond and understand all train system status. The train system status and abnormal conditions are categorised and displayed in real time and prioritised in order of critical system hierarchy. As an option, critical data can be logged for further analysis. The train is equipped with automatic train protection (ATP) system to prevent collisions. The ATP system can be optionally upgraded to an automatic train operation (ATO) system to automate operations of the monorail. == Users == SUTRA's first user, the Mumbai Monorail  Operational  *KL Monorail ‚Äì Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia **Quantity: 12 units of 4-car sets on order.

The national governing body of athletics at that level is the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA). However, the California Community College system, the largest in the country with over 100 institutions, is not a member of the NJCAA, instead governing its sports through the unaffiliated California Community College Athletic Association (CCCAA). Merging the records between these organizations has been left to the independent publication Track and Field News (T&FN;) primarily in the person of Robert Hersh, who also supervises records for USA Track and Field (USATF). Starting in the 1970s, many community colleges began recruiting foreign born athletes. With some of the best athletes in the world competing against American college freshmen and sophomores, an additional set of records for the best American born athletes was also included. T&FN; was not 100% accurate when assessing which athletes are not Americans. They were not given assistance by the colleges, who tended not to discuss the foreign roots of some of their recruits. Additionally, with the less restrictive eligibility regulations (as compared to the very strict NCAA regulations), foreign born athletes could be older than the 18- to 20-year-old Americans who entered community college immediately following high school. All of these records appear to be exclusively from Community College level competition, as opposed to the means T&FN; uses in calculating High School records, where they allow all attempts by a high school affiliated athlete made against Open level competitors. ==Men== Key: ' after name = non-U.S. citizen (A) = altitude-aided mark--over 1000m of altitude (in affected events only) i = made indoors (banked-track marks not acceptable) { style=\\"font-size: 95%; width: 95%;\\" - !Event !Record !Athlete !School !Place !Date !Ref !Video - rowspan=3100 m -bgcolor=#CEF6F5  9.93  Kemarley Brown'  Merritt College  Walnut, California  5/17/14 http://www.runblogrun.com/2014/05/merritts-kemarley- browns-993-cracks-into-northern-californias-historic-center-of-speed-by-fred- baer.html -bgcolor=#f6F5CE  10.05 Ryan Bailey Rend Lake College Hutchinson, Kansas 5/22/09 - rowspan=3200 m -bgcolor=#CEF6F5  19.82  Kenny Bednarek  Indian Hills Community College  Hobbs, New Mexico  5/18/19   - 20.08 Aaron Armstrong' Barton Community College Norman, Oklahoma 4/10/99 - 400 m 44.52 Tyree Washington San Bernardino Valley College Bakersfield, California 5/03/97 - rowspan=2800 m 1:45.15 Boaz Lalang' Rend Lake College Eugene, Oregon 5/09/08 -bgcolor=#f6F5CE 1:46.60 George Kersh Taft College Walnut, California 4/23/89 - rowspan=21500 m 3:37.62 Boaz Lalang' Rend Lake College Hillsdale, Michigan 4/25/08 -bgcolor=#f6F5CE colspan=5(unknown) - Mile 4:00.0 Reggie McAfee Brevard Community College Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 4/16/71 - rowspan=23000 m steeplechase 8:29.4 Julius Kariuki' Riverside City College Walnut, California 4/23/88 -bgcolor=#f6F5CE 8:49.7 Nathan Morris Lane Community College Eugene, Oregon 5/14/83 - rowspan=25000 m 13:25.20 Noureddine Morceli' Riverside City College Walnut, California 4/21/90 -bgcolor=#f6F5CE 13:59.20 Mark Ruelas Citrus College Bakersfield, California 5/15/82 - rowspan=210000 m 28:35.0 Mark Roberts' Central Arizona College Walnut, California 4/25/87 -bgcolor=#f6F5CE 29:03.0 Kirk Pfeffer Grossmont College Irvine, California 3/28/76 - 110 m hurdles 13.32 Ryan Brathwaite' Barton Community College Austin, Texas 4/04/09 - 400 m hurdles 49.29 Eric Thomas Blinn College Odessa, Texas 5/21/94 - 4 √ó 100 m relay 38.86 colspan=2Odessa College (Jon Drummond, James Law, Rodney Eleby, Pat Drake) Odessa, Texas 5/16/87 - 4 √ó 200 m relay 1:20.79 colspan=2Central Arizona College (Richard Butler, Garfield Campbell' , Patrick O'Connor' , Howard Davis' ) Walnut, California 4/24/88 - rowspan=24 √ó 400 m relay - 3:01.32 colspan=2South Plains College (Alistair Moona' , Daniel Harper' , Vernon Norwood, Bralon Taplin) Lubbock, Texas 5/05/12 - 4 √ó 800 m relay 7:19.24 colspan=2Blinn College (Jimmy Pierre-Louis 1:51.5, Jean Destine' 1:50.7, Cliff Beckford 1:51.3, Savieri Ngidhi' 1:45.7) Austin, Texas 4/03/92 - 4 √ó 1500 m relay 15:41.66 colspan=2Blinn College (Junior Mitchell 3:55.1, Godfrey Siamusiye' 3:52.5, Richie Dikstall 3:54.8, Herbert Habyarimana' 3:59.3) Brenham, Texas 4/20/94  - 4√óMile relay 16:31.0 colspan=2Allegheny College (Tarald Lindvigsmoen' 4:08.6, Malcolm East' 4:06.4, Amos Korir' 4:00.2, James Rotich' 4:15.8) Knoxville, Tennessee 4/14/78 - Sprint medley relay 3:12.67 colspan=2Blinn College (James Dibble, Jason Hendrix, Lamont Smith 45.7, Savieri Ngidhi' 1:45.9) Austin, Texas 4/02/93 - Distance medley relay 9:41.65 colspan=2Ranger College (Ricky Roberts, George Bullard, Zak Gwandu' , Pat Chester') Austin, Texas 4/05/85 - 4x110 Hurdles 56.52 colspan=2Blinn College (Henrik Dag√•rd' , Rory Norris, Brian Richardson, Kevin White) Lafayette, Louisiana 3/27/93  - High jump  Dennis Lewis Long Beach City College Los Angeles, California 3/30/85 - Pole vault  Dason Phelps Paradise Valley Community College Glendale, Arizona 3/18/00 - Long jump  Vernon George Odessa College Odessa, Texas 5/17/85 - rowspan=2Triple jump  James Beckford' Blinn College Odessa, Texas 5/20/95 -bgcolor=#f6F5CE  Walter Davis Barton Community College Baton Rouge, Louisiana 5/19/00 - Shot put  Ron Semkiw Mesa Community College Mesa, Arizona 3/05/74 - rowspan=2Discus throw  Andrey Kokhanovskiy' Blinn College Pasadena, Texas 4/26/95 -bgcolor=#f6F5CE  Brian Williams Iowa Central Community College Mt.

Shtykov's support for Kim Il-sung was crucial in Kim's rise to power, and the two persuaded Stalin to allow the Korean War to begin in June 1950. A prot√©g√© of the influential politician Andrei Zhdanov, General Shtykov served as a political commissar during World War II, ending up on the Military Council of the Primorskiy Military District. Through direct access to Joseph Stalin, Shtykov became the \\"real supreme ruler of North Korea, the principal supervisor of both the Soviet military and the local authorities.\\" Shtykov conceived of the Soviet Civil Administration, supported Kim's appointment as head of the North Korean provisional government, and assisted Stalin with editing the first North Korean constitution. As the preeminent representative of the Soviet Union's political authority over the nascent North Korea from October 1945 until December 1950, Shtykov's legacy was to aid the Kim family's rise to power. The war they started freed Kim from Soviet domination; China intervened following North Korea's poor military performance in the early autumn. Shtykov was fired as ambassador in December and demoted to major general the following month. He later served as the Soviet ambassador to Hungary from 1959 to 1960. Andrei Lankov asserts that Shtykov made more impact on Korean history than any foreigner other than Japanese colonial politicians, and that he was \\"the actual architect of the North Korean state as it emerged in 1945-50.\\" Several of Shtykov's policies, most notably North Korean land reform, are today credited to Kim Il-sung by official North Korean media. == Early life == Shtykov was born in 1907 to a family of farmers in eastern Belarus. In 1929 he joined the Communist Party in Leningrad and became a Komsomol activist. In 1938 Shtykov became the Second Secretary of the Leningrad Regional Committee,Centre for Preservation and Study of Documents for Contemporary History, fond 644, opis 2, delo 55, list 117. where he became the protege of First Secretary Andrei Zhdanov. Zhdanov's support allowed Shtykov to rise rapidly: he even briefly held a leading role in the Great Purge that September. ==World War II== During World War II, Shtykov served as a political commissar in several fronts near Leningrad. By the end of the war he was one of only three Colonel general political commissars (the highest rank allowed for political commissars in the Red Army). As political commissar of the Far Eastern Front, Shtykov assisted Marshal Kirill Meretskov in accepting the surrender of Japan in northern Korea on August 19, 1945. After the war, he was made deputy commander of the Primorskiy Military District. == Supreme Leader of North Korea == Following the division of Korea, Joseph Stalin sought to turn northern Korea into a socialist buffer state between the Soviet bloc and the American occupation in the southern half of the peninsula. Shtykov's influence rose in tandem with the rise of his mentor Andrei Zhdanov, who was thought to be Stalin's most likely successor after the war. As member of the Military Council for the Primorskiy District, Shtykov frequently visited Pyongyang and communicated to Zhdanov and Stalin about developments on the Korean Peninsula. Shtykov \\"exercised extremely close supervision over political events in North Korea\\" on Stalin's behalf. Shtykov also headed the Soviet delegation to the Joint Soviet-American Commission on Korea The Americans thought Shtykov was a \\"hot-tempered authoritarian,\\" and the two governments failed to negotiate a unified government for the Korean peninsula. As the most powerful man in the northern occupation zone of Korea, Shtykov personally selected the composition of the Soviet Civil Administration, and its second leader would comment that ‚Äúthere was not an event [in North Korea] in which Shtykov was not involved.‚Äù Shtykov's strong support of Kim Il-sung was decisive in Kim's rise to power. Shtykov continued to be the preeminent power in the North after Kim was made chairman of the Provisional People's Committee for North Korea. In December 1946, Shtykov and two other Soviet generals designed the election results of the Assembly for the Provisional Committee. Without any Korean input, the generals decided \\"the exact distribution of seats among the parties, the number of women members, and, more broadly, the precise social composition of the legislature.\\" The original 1948 North Korean constitution was primarily authored by Stalin and Shtykov in Moscow. The constitution only went into effect after the two had a lengthy discussion editing the draft, though some articles were later rewritten by Soviet supervisors. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was proclaimed after the withdrawal of Soviet forces in 1948, and Shtykov was named the first Soviet Ambassador to the DPRK.  Land reform  General Shtykov was the main instigator of North Korea's March 1946 land reform program, though Kim Il-sung usually gets the credit for it in both North and South Korea. Originally, the Soviet blueprint for land reform had involved compensating the large landowners and selling the land to the farmers. Shtykov suggested that the land be confiscated from landowners and Japanese collaborators and distributed to poor and landless peasants without compensation. The nationwide land reform broke the feudal socioeconomic structure and proved highly popular with many North Korean peasants. Many rich landowners and collaborators fled South, allowing the reform to happen with little bloodshed.  Korean War  While Stalin intended to use North Korea as a buffer state to American- friendly South Korea and Japan, Shtykov was sympathetic to North Korean attempts to 'liberate' the South through socialism. Shtykov supported Kim Il- sung and Bak Heon-yong's 31 May 1949 proposal to create a Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland to advocate for peaceful unification of North and South, noting that Syngman Rhee's likely refusal would damage his legitimacy among the Korean population. Shtykov suspected that Rhee would attack the North by June 1950, and backed the DFUF \\"to slow down southern aggression, cultivate alliances with anti-Rhee forces in the South, and make the Americans appear opposed to North-South unification.\\" After the victory of the People's Republic of China in the Chinese Civil War Kim persistently lobbied the Soviets to support a Northern-led violent unification of the peninsula. Shtykov was sympathetic to Kim's proposal and helped him persuade a reluctant Stalin to accept Kim's cause. Kim and Shtykov assured Stalin that the war would be a short victorious blitzkrieg \\"at almost no cost\\", and Shtykov predicted that it would not provoke American involvement. On June 25, 1950, North Korea invaded the South. Seoul fell rapidly, and by late July the DPRK controlled all of Korea save Busan and the surrounding area. But after American intervention at the Battle of Inchon, the military situation reversed. North Korea was only saved by Chinese intervention, but this was not enough to save Shtykov's diplomatic career. ==Later career and death== After being fired, Shtykov was demoted to major general on 3 February 1951 and was appointed deputy chairman of Kaluga Oblast. He later served as First Secretary of Novgorod and Primorskiy Oblast, before being named Ambassador to Hungary in 1959. Shtykov's hardline Stalinism clashed with J√°nos K√°d√°r's Goulash Communism policies, and he was recalled in 1960. He served as Chairman of the State Control Commission for the Council of Ministers of the Russian Soviet Federal Republic before dying on vacation in 1964. == Historic significance == Shtykov's decisions proved highly consequential for the Korean Peninsula and the world. Although Shtykov was the preeminent leader of North Korea from 1945-1950, he allowed Koreans to take the credit for his policies. Shtykov's support of Kim Il-sung over other Korean communists such as Pak Hon-yong was a chief factor in the Kim dynasty's rise to power. Additionally, Shtykov masterminded the 1946 land reform in North Korea, which was arguably the most popular policy conducted in either Korea. South Korea reversed the land reform during the brief United Nations occupation of the North, which provoked a backlash among Northern farmers. Most significant was Shtykov's decision to support Kim's effort to violently reunite the peninsula, which ended his career. Had Shtykov been unsympathetic to Kim's expansionist aims, it is highly unlikely that Stalin would have authorized the Korean War. While the war did not end in the liberation of the American-backed South, it did allow Kim Il-sung to secure effective North Korean independence from the Soviet Union. All of Shtykov's actions are today attributed to Kim Il-sung by North Korean official media, and even South Korean media assumes that Kim was the driving force behind land reform. ==References== Category:1907 births Category:1964 deaths Category:People from Gorodoksky Uyezd Category:Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union members Category:First convocation members of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union Category:Second convocation members of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union Category:Fourth convocation members of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union Category:Fifth convocation members of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union Category:Ambassadors of the Soviet Union to North Korea Category:Ambassadors of the Soviet Union to Hungary Category:Anti-revisionists Category:Communist rulers Category:Kim Il-sung Category:Soviet colonel generals Category:Soviet military personnel of the Winter War Category:Soviet military personnel of World War II Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin Category:Recipients of the Order of the Red Banner Category:Recipients of the Order of Kutuzov, 1st class Category:Recipients of the Order of Suvorov, 1st class Category:Burials at Bogoslovskoe Cemetery ","title":"Terenty Shtykov"},{"id":"46416763","text":"Perssonska g√•rden is a listed building in Hedemora, Dalarna County, Sweden.

Johnson and Jane Squire are the only two women known to have done so. It was not considered an appropriate subject for early modern women especially given its financial, maritime, and government dimensions. ==Early background== She was born to the Rev. Samuel Reynolds and his wife Theophilia in Plympton, Devon. Among her siblings was the acclaimed artist Sir Joshua Reynolds, who used her as a model for works which were widely copied in mezzotint. The two would later quarrel over Joshua's lack of piety and over her husband's precarious financial situation and eventual bankruptcy. Their other siblings included the author Mary Palmer and painter Frances Reynolds. ==Married life== On 7 January 1753, Elizabeth Reynolds married William Johnson at St. Michael and All Angels in Great Torrington, Devon. The marriage produced seven children before her spouse abandoned the family, leaving Elizabeth at least in part dependent on her literary endeavors. ==Publications== Johnson's religious pamphlets, beginning with The Explication of the Vision to Ezekiel in 1781, were written anonymously ‚Äì likely to evade any criticism of women publishing or expressing religious ideas. One critic sarcastically commented on her earlier works in 1783: \\"As the intentions of this writer are pious, his facilities evidently disordered, and his lucubrations absolutely unintelligible, these three pamphlets must be exempted from criticism.\\" William Johnson Cory later revealed the true identity of the pamphlets' author in a handwritten inscription on one of the Bodleian Library's copies of the Ezekiel pamphlet: \\"This strange book was written by my great-grandmother Mrs. Johnson, sister of Sir Joshua Reynolds. When extremely poor she posted up to Oxford to get it published, being a real enthusiast.\\" ==Longitude== The Astronomy and Geography of the Created World, her fourth pamphlet published in 1785, included a short reference to longitude. The pamphlet ended with the claim \\"that if the palm for finding the longitude, is not given to the author of the Explanation of the Vision to Ezikiel it will never be given to another\\". The modern attribution of the Ezekiel pamphlet to Johnson has only recently revealed that the author of the 1785 work was a rare female longitude-seeker, as she even remained anonymous when sending it to the Board of Longitude in 1786 in the hope of a reward. She was unsuccessful, and the pamphlet and letter were later catalogued by the Astronomer Royal George Airy in a volume of Board of Longitude correspondence which he entitled Irrational Astronomical Theories in 1858. However, it was not the only early modern pamphlet to address both religion and longitude. Elizabeth Johnson died in Great Torrington, Devon in 1800. ==References== Category:1721 births Category:1800 deaths Category:English astronomers Category:Women astronomers Category:People from Plympton Category:Joshua Reynolds ","title":"Elizabeth Johnson (pamphleteer)"},{"id":"46416783","text":"The 1948 Paris‚ÄìRoubaix was the 46th edition of the Paris‚ÄìRoubaix, a classic one-day cycle race in France.

He was a founder of scientific management. ==Life== The son of an innkeeper, Bergery was born in Orl√©ans. He was a student at the √âcole Polytechnique which he entered in 1806, He became an artillery captain, serving in Spain, and was decorated by Napoleon I during the Hundred Days. Demobilised, he taught applied science at the √âcole royale de l'artillerie in Metz from 1817, then transferred to teacher training in the same city. Bergery believed the study of applied geometry was improving. With Jean-Victor Poncelet, he created free courses for workers and artisans, in response to a call from Charles Dupin. Courses were given in 1826 by Bergery, Poncelet, Libre-Irmond Bardin and Jean-Louis Woisard, all past polytechniciens. In the aftermath of the July Revolution of 1830 Bergery had a chance to move to Paris. He had supporters who wished to keep out Adolphe Blanqui, who became successor to Jean-Baptiste Say at the Conservatoire national des arts et m√©tiers; and he might have combined that position with the artillery professorship at Vincennes. In the event, he preferred to stay in Metz. He was elected a corresponding member of the moral section of the Acad√©mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques on 25 January 1834. Bergery was one of the founders in 1834 of La Gerbe de la Moselle, a monthly periodical to which he contributed. It ran to 1839, and Bergery became the major contributor. From 1840 it was succeeded by L'instituteur de la Moselle, which became in 1842 Le Messager de la Moselle. Bergery was on its editorial committee. The Gerbe proved divisive in Metz, in particular with Bergery's line as moralist and social critic. In 1835 Bergery quarrelled seriously with Poncelet and Fran√ßois Th√©odore Gosselin, who accused him of plagiarism; and his position in Metz was undermined. He became the mayor of Tincry in 1848, where he opened a primary school for girls in 1857. He was made an Officer of the Legion of Honour in 1847 when he retired. He died at Tincry. ==Works== Bergery's thought drew heavily on the thought of Dupin, Say and G√©rard-Joseph Christian, who was director of the Conservatoire. He was influenced particularly by the Cours complet d'√©conomie politique pratique of Say. He wrote: *G√©om√©trie des courbes appliqu√©e √† l'industrie (1825), based on public lectures. *Economie industrielle, ou, Science de l'industrie (1829‚Äì31). This work was in three volumes, the first (1829, 2nd edition 1833) being Economie de l'ouvrier, the second and third Economie du fabricant. Where the first volume included advice for lifestyle of a worker, the others were a management manual, the whole being connected by the idea that a frugal worker could, with temperance and restraint, accumulate capital. Volume 1 gained Bergery a Prix Montyon. This was an early course covering industrial management as a whole. It appeared at the same time as work of Charles Babbage in the same area. Bergery paid more attention to the issue of recruitment, and tried to quantify the cost of Monday absenteeism. *Th√©orie des affuts et des voitures d'artillerie (1840) with Jean-Charles Migout. This work on gun carriages was based on a course given at Metz in the later 1820s by Bergery and two colleagues (the obscure Migout and Jean-Louis Woisard, 1798‚Äì1828), at the request of the War Ministry. The second edition advocated for interchangeable parts. The authors wrote also a Cours des Machines (1842) for artillery officers. Arithm√©tique appliqu√©e aux sp√©culations commerciales et industrielles (1830) was the second edition by Bergery of a book by the late Woisard. Bergery also wrote textbooks and elementary works on elementary geometry, chemistry and other topics. In 1837 Complements to his arithmetic text addressed the teaching of probability, in the context of gambling and economics, then an innovative idea. ==Notes== Category:1787 births Category:1863 deaths Category:French economists Category:French social scientists Category:French business theorists Category:People from Orl√©ans ","title":"Claude Lucien Bergery"},{"id":"46416873","text":"John Duckworth FREng (27 December 1916 ‚Äì 8 January 2015) was a British physicist known for his involvement in the development of Britain's radar defence network during World War II. He also served as the director of the National Research Development Corporation (NRDC), and helped supervise Britain's efforts to develop nuclear technology in the 1950s. Duckworth worked as an industrial consultant in his later life. ==Early life and education== John Clifford Duckworth was born in east London in 1916, the son of an entrepreneur who owned companies that manufactured batteries and radium-based cosmetics. Duckworth attended King's College School, Wimbledon, before going to study physics at Wadham College, Oxford, where he was captain of the college tennis team. After graduating with a first-class honours degree, Duckworth worked as a researcher in nuclear physics at Oxford's Clarendon Laboratory, but was recruited by the Air Ministry Research Establishment (AMRE) upon the outbreak of war in 1939. ==Wartime radar work== During his time with AMRE, Duckworth was involved in the enhancement of the British air defence radar network, helping to develop and install new radar transmitters capable of detecting low-flying enemy aircraft. Later in the war, when British naval convoys came under attack from German bombers, Duckworth worked on developing radar systems for merchant shipping, and also helped create a multi-station ground-based radar interception system for the Royal Air Force. When Germany began using V-1 flying bombs against British cities in 1944, Duckworth helped improve the RAF's radar cover to allow fighter aircraft to intercept the fast-moving V-1s. ==Postwar career== After World War II, Duckworth briefly worked in Canada before joining the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) at Harwell, Oxfordshire, supervising the construction of the facility's linear particle accelerator. Thereafter, he joined the electronics company Ferranti, working on the development of the Bloodhound guided missile. In 1955, the British government appointed Duckworth the overseer of the bidding process for the construction of Britain's first nuclear reactors. In 1959, Duckworth became the managing director of the National Research Development Corporation (NRDC), a post he held for 11 years. Among the NRDC projects he oversaw was the development of the highly successful antibiotic cephalosporin. After retiring from the NRDC, Duckworth worked for many years as an industrial consultant, and served on the boards of several companies. ==Personal life== In 1942, Duckworth married Dorothy Wills, who predeceased him. The couple were survived by their three sons. ==References * Category:1916 births Category:2015 deaths Category:British physicists ","title":"John Duckworth (physicist)"},{"id":"46416893","text":"Alexandra R√∂seler is a German operatic mezzo-soprano and pianist.

The government was first known as the Viceroy's Government and was renamed the Tianjin Provisional Government on 14 August. The Tianjin Provisional Government had military control over Tianjin, Chinghai, Ningho and some other regions, with 8 subordinate executive organizations. It had a patrolling team of 900 allied forces gunmen directly under its control. The Norwegian railway engineer and former officer Benjamin Wegner N√∏rregaard, who had worked in China for the last few years, was employed as a sort of minister of labour, and also designed the monumental government headquarters. Most of the United States 15th Infantry Regiment arrived in Tianjin on 16 August 1900, as part of the China Relief Expedition.

He was canonized in 2001. Canonization of 5 blesseds ==Biography== St. Luigi Scrosoppi was the last of three brothers born to Domenico Scrosoppi, a jeweler from Udine, and Antonia Lazzarini. His brother Carlo was ordained to the priesthood when Luigi was six and his other brother Giovanni Battista followed. As a teenager, he felt a call to the priesthood and studied before he was ordained to the diaconate in 1826. He was ordained to the priesthood on 31 March 1827 and celebrated his first Mass with his brothers. He helped to manage a children's center that his brother Carlo ran and he was an assistant there in 1829. Later joined the Third Order of Franciscans. As head of the ‚Äúunion of the heart of Jesus Christ,‚Äù he devoted himself to the construction of an orphanage and supported his brother Carlo, who also was a priest. He gave himself tirelessly to fundraising and was soon running an organization that accommodated 100 boarders and 230-day pupils in a building which became known as the House of the Destitute. Scrosoppi established the Sisters of Providence of Saint Cajetan of Thiene and it was to receive the official approval of Pope Pius IX on 22 September 1871. Luigi joined the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri in 1846 and was elected as its provost on 9 November 1856. On 7 March 1857, he opened a school and home for deaf-mute girls, only surviving for fifteen years. He died on 3 April 1884 after a long illness. ==Patron Saint of footballers== Statue of patron saint S. Luigi Scrosoppi.

On August 22nd, 2010 Scrosoppi was appointed patron saint of footballers by Bishop Alois Schwarz at a church service in the Austrian parish of P√∂rtschach at W√∂rthersee in coordination with the Roman authorities and Andrea Bruno Mazzocato, the archbishop of Udine. A patron saint for footballers did not previously exist thus the idea of appointing Luigi Scrosoppi was initiated by the ‚ÄúW√∂rthersee Zukunftsinitiative\\" from football fan Manfred Pesek. Schwarz, the Bishop of Gurk in Klagenfurt, supported the proposal in the appropriate Vatican section ‚ÄúChurch and Sport‚Äù largely because soccer for youth is of great importance and meaning. Luigi Scrosoppi had to be distinguished in a special way to the youth. He represents values that are developed through sport, such as fairness, perseverance, diligence, and determination. Other supporters of the initiative were Nikolaus Kn√∂pffler, Chair of the Department of Applied Ethics and Director of the ‚ÄúEthikzentrum‚Äù at the Friedrich-Schiller-University of Jena, Walter Walzl, Florian Becker, Robert Hofferer and Stefan Gottschling, who helped make the realisation of this initiative possible. The bishop of Udine, the home Diocese of Luigi Scrosoppi, was also involved in the approval and preparation of this project. ==Sainthood== The introduction of the cause for sainthood - which conferred upon him the title of Servant of God - came on 27 February 1964 under Pope Paul VI. The declaration that he led a life of heroic virtue allowed for Paul VI to name him Venerable on 12 June 1978. Pope John Paul II beatified him on 4 October 1981 and would also canonize him as a saint on 10 June 2001.His Day of Remembrance in the Liturgy is on April 3rd (day of his death). The miracle for canonization For the purposes of canonization, the Catholic Church considers to be necessary have a second miracle after the one required for the beatification: in the case of Luigi Scrosoppi, it considered miraculous the healing of Peter Chungu Shitima, a terminal AIDS sufferer, which occurred in 1996. Peter Chungu Shitima was a student of the oratory of St. Philip Neri of Oudtshoorn, a town near the southern coast of South Africa. In the spring of 1996, he began to experience increasingly serious disturbances, so much so that he was hospitalized, where he was diagnosed with AIDS at the terminal stage. The religious community in which he belonged began unremitting prayers, to obtain the intercession of the then blessed Luigi Scrosoppi. In the night between 9 and 10 October 1996, the young man dreamed of the Blessed Scrosoppi, and suddenly he felt he was cured, awakening, resuming his normal activity. The healing was observed by doctors Johannes Le Roux and Pete du Toit, both non-Catholics, who could not explain the incident. The case, examined at the Oudtshoorn Curia, was submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints who, on July 1, 2000, promulgated in the presence of Pope John Paul IIbirminghamoratory.org.uk the miracle decree for the \\"rapid, complete and lasting healing of Peter Chungu Shitima by polyineuritis and cachexia in positive HIV subject.Peter Changu Shitima: Curado milagrosamente, interrogantes.net, 2007-09-12 ==References *Hagiography Circle *Saints SQPN Category:1804 births Category:1884 deaths Category:Italian Roman Catholic saints Category:Canonizations by Pope John Paul II Category:Founders of Catholic religious communities Category:19th-century venerated Christians ","title":"Luigi Scrosoppi"},{"id":"46416958","text":"Greg Davis (born 1 June 1955) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Footscray in the Victorian Football League (VFL). == Notes  External links == * * Category:Living people Category:1955 births Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Western Bulldogs players ","title":"Greg Davis (Australian footballer)"},{"id":"46416961","text":"Audrius Nakas (born 1967) is a Lithuanian politician and a member of the Seimas.

The electoral system was introduced for the first time in 1847, and 4 of the 7 board members were elected by the rate payers. In 1852 the board was replaced by a new one and in 1863 a new body was formed. As per old records, in 1872 there were 25 wards in Kolkata (spellings as in use at that time) ‚Äì 1. Shyampukur, 2.

It was founded in 1844 in Menzingen, Canton Zug, Switzerland by Mother Bernarda Heimgartner, now listed as \\"Venerable\\" by the Catholic Church. The order is now international with about 1700 sisters. ==History== Theodosius Florentini Rev. Fr. Theodosius Florentini OFM Cap. envisaged a religious congregation of teachers who would educate children, especially girls, who as future mothers would preserve the faith in their families. Thus, he founded the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross in October 1844 with three young ladies, Maria Anna Heimgartner, (later Mother Bernarda), Cornelia Mader, and Feliciana Cramer. Before long, more young women joined them, and the sisters took up education in many church-run as well as Govt. Schools in Switzerland. Mother Bernarda is honored as the Co-foundress of the Congregation. Mother Bernarda Heimgartner Maria Anna Heimgartner was born in Fislisbach, Canton Aargau on November 26, 1822. Her father died when she was fourteen. After her education, she worked as a children's nurse between 1838 and 1840. Feeling called to religious life, she began studies with the canonesses in Baden. She joined the 'Sisters of Divine Providence' in Ribeauville, Alsace between 1843 and 1844. From the village of Menzingen the congregation grew and spread mainly to the poorer central parts of Switzerland. In July 1883 the first five Holy Cross Sisters arrived in Durban in answer to a call for missionaries in Southern Africa. They travelled by steamship from Southampton. Upon arriving they up the St John's River and continued their journey by ox wagon to Umtata, where they established their first school and a hospital.\\"Holy Cross George celebrates 120 years\\", George Herald Nine sisters travelled from Menzingen to nurse the sick in government hospitals at Trivandrum and Quilon, India.Hull, Ernest. \\"Diocese of Quilon.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12.

It is a showy, medium-sized shrub which produces large numbers of pink flowers in spring. There are three varieties recognised, one of which has been known in cultivation for many years. ==Description== Melaleuca pentagona is a medium-sized shrub growing to about tall with papery grey or white bark. The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, mostly long and wide, linear to narrow elliptic in shape and with a groove on the upper surface. The flowers are a shade of pink or purple and arranged in heads at the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering and sometimes also in the upper leaf axils. The heads are up to in diameter and contain 3 to 8 groups of flowers in threes. The petals are long and fall off as the flowers open. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle with 2 to 8 stamens. Flowering time varies with subspecies but in general occurs in spring and summer. The fruit are woody capsules long, in spherical clusters up to in diameter. M. pentagona leaves and flowers M. pentagona fruit M. pentagona bark ==Taxonomy and naming== Melaleuca pentagona was first formally described in 1806 by the French biologist, Jacques Labillardi√®re in Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen. The specific epithet (pentagona) is from the Ancient Greek œÄŒ≠ŒΩœÑŒµ (p√©nte) meaning ‚Äúfive‚Äù and Œ≥œâŒΩŒØŒ± (g≈çn√≠a) meaning ‚Äúangle‚Äù referring to the fruiting capsules being compressed into a five-sided shape. The varieties recognised are: *Melaleuca pentagona var. latifolia Benth. which occurs in and between the Esperance, Israelite Bay and Toolinna districts, flowers in late spring and grows in heath and mallee on sandy soils near salt lakes; * Melaleuca pentagona Labill. var. pentagona which occurs in and between the Mount Barker, Albany and Esperance districts, flowering mainly in spring and summer and grows in heath, mallee and woodland in sandy, clay or gravelly soil over granite and sandstone; * Melaleuca pentagona var. raggedensis Craven which occurs in the Cape Arid National Park in heath, mallee and shrubland in sandy or stony soil often around granite rocks. The variety name (raggedensis) refers to the locality Mount Ragged in the Cape Arid National Park where this variety occurs. ==Distribution and habitat== Melaleuca pentagona occurs in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee and Warren biogeographic regions. ==Ecology== This species of Melaleuca has become an invasive, environmental weed in some parts of Western Australia. ==Conservation== This species is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. ==Use in horticulture== Melaleuca pentagona var. pentagona is well known in cultivation, suitable to a range of soils and conditions. ==References== pentagona Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Plants described in 1806 Category:Endemic flora of Western Australia ","title":"Melaleuca pentagona"},{"id":"46417342","text":"The Dugi Archeological Site is a prehistoric latte stone site on the north side of Rota Island in the Northern Mariana Islands.

He is most well known for performing the first transfemoral and the first transapical transcatheter aortic valve implantation in the world both in 2005. He completed the first ever transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve replacement in 2009 and the first in-human TMVR (transcatheter mitral valve replacement) to be completed with the Neovasc Tiara device in 2014. In addition, he was an investigator in the PARTNER trial, a randomized clinical trial demonstrating the efficacy of TAVI compared to aortic valve replacement and medical intervention. ==Education== John G. Webb completed his undergraduate education at Simon Fraser University and graduated with his BSc (Hons) in Biology in 1978. He completed medical school at the University of British Columbia in 1982. He completed his internship at the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine and completed his internal medicine residency back at the University of British Columbia in 1985.

On 13 April 2015, the aircraft crashed into a mountain en route to Prince George Airport, killing both crew members. == History of the flight == The flight had taken off from Vancouver International Airport at approximately 7:02 PDT. The aircraft subsequently descended from 2,400 meters to 900 meters in less than a minute. Air traffic controllers lost radar contact with the aircraft as it was en route to Prince George at roughly 7:08. == Aircraft and crew == The aircraft, a twin-turboprop Swearingen SA226-TC Metro II, serial number TC-325, registered C-GSKC, was manufactured in 1977. Carson Air was its only operator. The aircraft was not equipped with a cockpit voice recorder or a flight data recorder. The crew consisted of only the cockpit crew, 34-year-old pilot Robert Brandt and 32-year-old co-pilot Kevin Wang. == Search == The aircraft crashed into a hillside area near Crown Mountain, a part of the North Shore Mountains. Two helicopters and two aircraft from North Shore Rescue participated in the search for the wreckage of the aircraft, which was slowed by poor weather conditions. It was later discovered that the emergency locating transmitter was activated, but did not send out a signal. == Investigation == The accident was investigated by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB), which determined the cause of the accident to be an in-flight breakup cause by a rapid descent. However, no definite reason was found as to why the descent was initiated. An autopsy performed on the two pilots by the British Columbia Coroner Service revealed that pilot Brandt had a blood alcohol level of 0.24 percent, three times the legal limit for a driver. ==References== Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2015 Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Canada Category:2015 disasters in Canada Category:April 2015 events in Canada Category:Vancouver International Airport Category:2015 in British Columbia ","title":"Carson Air Flight 66"},{"id":"46417414","text":"Aidan Joseph McQuade has been Director (Chief Executive) of Anti-Slavery International since 2006.

The novel is about a mother who has to come to terms with her five-year-old son being diagnosed with leukemia and efforts to cure him. Globus published a copy of the book in Zagreb in 1989. ==Background== Born in Dubrovnik, Krmpotiƒá began her career as a poet and was among the first in Croatia to study and translate Indian literature. She learned Bengali while living in India, and her work shows the influence of Indian philosophy. Krmpotiƒá has also lived in Egypt, the United States and Ghana, and while in the US she learned that her five-year-old son was suffering from leukemia. In her book, A Hill Above the Clouds, Vesna documents the futile efforts she made to save her son's life through the ancient philosophies of Egypt and India. In the process, she encounters Sai Baba, which had a profound impact on her life and writing. In the book, her diary entries records her son‚Äôs life from the time of his birth, symptoms of his disease, the trials and tribulations she faced to get him treated, her son's reaction to his sufferings and the boy realizing his state of health when he gives his toys away with a tragic comment: \\"Take them because I'll never come back.\\" ==Analysis== According to Helena Forsas-Scott, the author \\"explores all possible avenues of treatment, official and alternative, and in the process describes an ultimately triumphant journey to a wide embracing faith, embracing aspects of many philosophies, including Ancient Egyptian and Indian\\". She further states that although it is not essentially a feminist work, it demonstrates the flexibilities of such women writers. One reviewer stated that it \\"looks like a novel but it does not have fictional characters and situations\\", remarking that it is a \\"kind of autobiography\\", with \\"faithful reportage of events and facts\\".

They were officially recognised when The Old English Game Club split, creating two breeds of Old English Game fowl. They are primarily farmed for meat but have been used for cock fighting and eggs on a domestic scale. ==History== The breed was first mentioned in the middle ages, when the English nobility selectively bred them for cockfighting. The Old English Game has been recognised in Great Britain since the 19th Century and is thought to be a descendant of the ancient fighting cocks. It is likely that they were the first selectively bred breed of chicken in Britain for fighting purposes. To prevent damage during fights, the comb and wattles were removed. This also gave the birds a more aggressive appearance. This practise is known as dubbing. Cockfighting has been banned in Britain since 1849, the breed is still popular as an ornamental fowl and a domestic chicken. When The Old English Game Club split in the 1930s two types of Old English Game were created, The Carlisle and The Oxford. The Carlisle has different qualities from the Oxford, such as being heavier, having a larger breast and a horizontal back. ==Characteristics== The Oxford Old English Game has a back angled 45¬∞ towards the ground and has approximately 30 different colour varieties. It is a small bird with many feathers on the plumage. The head is small with a big, strong beak, single comb, small thin earlobes and wattles with large eyes. The wings have a large surface area and the bird's legs are and short. They have four toes ending in long, curved nails that need to be trimmed often. The bird has a very even muscle distribution and has been described as being 'an excellent table bird'. A quarter-sized bantam exists. This bantam breed is the smallest bantam that exists. ==Uses== The bird lays eggs moderately well, compared to other birds of similar proportions. The bird is also primarily reared for meat. Traditionally, the bird was used for cockfighting but this is no longer practised in Britain. However, many other countries continue with cockfighting, and Old Oxford English Game is commonly used. ==References== Category:Chicken breeds Category:Chicken breeds originating in England ","title":"Oxford Old English Game fowl"},{"id":"46417575","text":"Tom Mayson (February 1, 1928 ‚Äì October 18, 2010) was a Canadian football player who played for the Edmonton Eskimos.

These teams played each other once over the course of the season, either home or away. Teams received four points for a win and two points for a draw. Bonus points were awarded to teams that scored four or more tries in a game, as well as to teams that lost a match by seven points or less. Teams were ranked by log points, then points difference (points scored less points conceded). The top four teams qualified for the title play-offs. In the semi-finals, the team that finished first had home advantage against the team that finished fourth, while the team that finished second had home advantage against the team that finished third.

Kappa-bungarotoxin is a high affinity antagonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), particularly of CHRNA3; it causes a post-synaptic blockade of neurotransmission. Although there is significant variability in the clinical effects of snake bites, neuromuscular paralysis and respiratory failure are associated with krait bites. == Discovery == Kappa-bungarotoxin was first reported in 1983 as a component of the venom of Bungarus multicinctus that differed in biological effect from the previously known alpha-bungarotoxin: kappa, but not alpha, was capable of impeding nicotinic signaling in the chick ciliary ganglion. Bungarotoxin toxin was designated \\"kappa\\" as an allusion to the Latin word kiliaris (\\"from the eye\\"), and to the root of \\"ciliary\\". Separately identified toxins designated \\"toxin F\\" and \\"bungarotoxin 3.1\\" were identified by protein sequencing as identical to kappa-bungarotoxin. == Mechanism and biological effects == Kappa-bungarotoxin binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of the autonomic ganglia, predominantly to the nicotinic receptor subunit alpha 3 (CHRNA3) and to a lesser extent alpha 4. Two distinct binding surfaces, both on the N-terminal extracellular face of the receptor subunit, have been identified. Kappa-bungarotoxin is a receptor antagonist, meaning it blocks the normal response of the receptor to acetylcholine, which inhibits neurotransmission and therefore causes neuromuscular paralysis. Like the alpha-bungarotoxins, kappa-bungarotoxin causes a post-synaptic blockade of signaling; this is in contrast to the beta- bungarotoxins which induce a pre-synaptic block. The distinction between the effects of alpha and kappa was first identified functionally, as differences in effects on specific neural structures. The basis of this functional difference has been molecularly characterized as differences in receptor subtype specificity; the pentameric receptors are assembled from different distributions of subunits in neurons and in muscles. == Structure == The kappa-bungarotoxin polypeptide is 66 amino acids long and folds into an antiparallel beta sheet structure stabilized by five conserved disulfide bonds, a structural feature shared by many peptide toxins. Unlike other members of the bungarotoxin family, kappa is a dimer. == References == Category:Neurotoxins Category:Nicotinic antagonists ","title":"Kappa-bungarotoxin"},{"id":"46417918","text":"The Stone Barn Farm is one of a small number of surviving farm properties on Mount Desert Island off the coast of Maine. Located at the junction of Crooked Road and Norway Drive, the farm has a distinctive stone barn, built in 1907, along with a c. 1850 Greek Revival farm house and carriage barn. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001, and is subject to a conservation easement held by the Maine Coast Heritage Trust. ==Description and history== Stone Barn Farm occupies of land in north-central Bar Harbor, a rural inland area of the fashionable resort community. It is set on the north side of Crooked Road, just west of its junction with Norway Drive, and consists of each of fields and marshland, and about of woodland. The farm complex is set near Crooked Road, and consists of a wood-frame house and carriage barn, and an unusual gambrel-roofed barn whose first level is stone and granite (the latter quarried from nearby Otter Creek). As of 2020, only its southern gambrel end is clapboarded. The house is 1-1/2 stories in height, with a three-bay gabled front sheltered by a hip-roofed porch. Two additions extend to the rear of the building. The carriage house a single- story clapboarded structure with a gable roof, and a track-mounted sliding door providing access to its interior. The stone barn is fashioned out of glacial till, and has a two-leaf board-and-batten door providing access to its interior. The farmhouse and carriage house were probably built sometime between 1850 and 1860, based on their architectural style, although local histories have placed the farmhouse construction as early as 1840. The builder was Richard Paine (1828‚Äì1913),Richard H. Paine - Find A Grave whose farm was , most of it uncleared, in 1860. In 1907 Paine's son, Willis, sold the farm to the Shea Brothers masonry firm, who may have built the stone barn as a vehicle to showcase their building skills. The Sheas eventually leased the property back to the Paines for a time. In 1963,\\"Land trust to buy Stone Barn Farm\\" - Mount Desert Islander, August 28, 2019 the property was acquired by Harry and Mary \\"Cindy\\" Owen,Mary ‚ÄúCindy‚Äù M.

The Chicago Tribune further reported > Matthews said his and Collett's actions were directed at the U.S. coaching > staff, not the flag or the National Anthem. \\"We were just mad about a lot of > things.

What > I tried to get across to the Olympic Committee was if it was pre-meditated I > could have done something better than that. It was just something that > happened. We didn't realize the implications to the people in the stands.\\" In an interview after the medal ceremony with the American Broadcasting Company, Collett said the national anthem meant nothing to him. He explained that he had felt unable to honor the anthem, because of the struggle faced by African Americans at the time: \\"I couldn't stand there and sing the words because I don't believe they're true. I wish they were. I believe we have the potential to have a beautiful country, but I don't think we do.\\" The pair were banned from future Olympic competition by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). IOC president Avery Brundage deemed it to be a domestic political statement unfit for the apolitical, international forum the Olympic Games were intended to be. Since John Smith had pulled a hamstring 80 meters into the final while leading and had been ruled unfit to run, the U.S. were now unable to field a team in the 4 √ó 400 meter relay and were forced to scratch from the event. Athlete statements > I wasn't acting any differently than I usually do, but we were like goldfish > in a fishbowl, in front of all those people. If they wanted me to stand at > attention, I could've probably done that, but it wouldn't be me, and I was > led to believe that the Olympics was for the athlete. We consider ourselves > athletes, not politicians, or marching bands. Our athletic competition was > over, and we were both happy. ==After the games== Both runners received a lifelong ban from the IOC. This banning forced the US to scratch from the 4 √ó 400 meter relay where the Americans would be favored to win. Both runners were eventually elected to the Black Olympian Hall of Fame. This display by the athletes would be overshadowed by the Munich massacre. Collett went on to become a lawyer. In 2011, Matthews was elected to the USATF Hall of Fame. ==Footnotes== Olympics Human Rights Salute, 1968 Olympics Human Rights Salute, 1968 Category:1972 in Germany Category:Civil rights protests Category:Black Power Category:Hand gestures Category:History of Munich Category:History of West Germany Category:Politics and race in the United States Category:Protests in Mexico Category:Olympic Games controversies Category:Anti-racism Category:Politics and sports Category:Salutes Olymp Olymp Category:1970s photographs Category:1972 protests Category:Color photographs ","title":"1972 Olympics Black Power salute"},{"id":"46417963","text":"Colin Shaw (born 24 September 1950) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Footscray in the Victorian Football League (VFL). == Notes  External links == * * Category:Living people Category:1950 births Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Western Bulldogs players ","title":"Colin Shaw (Australian footballer)"},{"id":"46417975","text":"Grant Simmons (born 9 June 1952) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Footscray in the Victorian Football League (VFL). == Notes  External links == * * Category:Living people Category:1952 births Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Western Bulldogs players Category:Sunshine Football Club (VFA) players ","title":"Grant Simmons"},{"id":"46417985","text":"Clive Newman (born 6 May 1949) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Footscray in the Victorian Football League (VFL). == Notes  External links == * * Category:Living people Category:1949 births Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Western Bulldogs players ","title":"Clive Newman"},{"id":"46417997","text":"Roger McHardy (born 13 August 1952) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Footscray in the Victorian Football League (VFL). == Notes  External links == * * Category:Living people Category:1952 births Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Western Bulldogs players Category:Doutta Stars Football Club players ","title":"Roger McHardy"},{"id":"46418011","text":"Robert Edmund Edwards (1926‚Äì2000),Encyclopedia of Australian ScienceObituary of Edwards' student Garth Ian GaudryNational Library of Australia usually cited simply as R.

A number of modifications were made to the structure, such as the removal of the doors and their frames, the space being converted into vaulted ceilings. The museum's first exhibition was dedicated to the Cuban Revolution and was held in the State Theater hall. Until 1966, the museum was more of a storage facility, as its gallery space was very small. That year, it moved into the current headquarters, located at 2 Nicolae BƒÉlcescu Street. The building, dating to 1920 and considered a historic monument by the country's Culture Ministry, was the first headquarters of the S. A. R.

On January 5, 2015, Cr√©peau joined German club Fortuna D√ºsseldorf for a ten-day training stint before the open of Montreal's pre- season camp for the 2015 MLS season. After spending the beginning of the 2015 season with the Impact, Cr√©peau sat on the bench as the backup goalkeeper during the second leg of the 2015 CONCACAF Champions League Finals. After the match, as originally planned, Cr√©peau was loaned to FC Montreal, the Impact's USL affiliate team, making his professional debut against the Rochester Rhinos on May 2, 2015. Cr√©peau would spend two seasons with FC Montreal before the club ceased operations after the 2016 season.

In the past, he has served as the rabbi of the Technion, as a lecturer in its Faculty of Mathematics, and in the Department of Humanities and Arts. ==Biography== Eliyahu Zini was born on 11 August 1946 to a family of Torah scholars, the eldest of Rachel and Rabbi Meir Zini, the rabbi of Taharat, Algeria. The origins of the Zini family are traced back to Rabbi Joseph Yoshto, a student of Isaac Alfasi from Ja√©n, Spain in northeastern Andalusia. His mother Rachel, a survivor of the Auschwitz death camp, met his father while he was an officer in the Free French Forces when the camp was liberated. With the end of French sovereignty in Algeria in 1962, Eliyahu Zini moved with his family to Paris, where he finished his secondary school studies and began studying mathematics in the University of Paris. He began rabbinical studies under Rabbi Shlomo Dahan. He also studied karate and earned his second-degree black belt. In 1970 he made aliyah to the land of Israel, living first in Bnei Brak and then moving to Haifa. There he became close with Rabbi Professor Benjamin Ze'ev Benedict, rabbi of the Ahuza neighborhood, from whom he would later receive semikhah. At the Technion, he completed his doctorate in mathematics which he had begun in Paris, and he did his post-doctorate at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Afterward, he returned to the Technion as a senior associate lecturer in the Faculty of Mathematics and as a senior associate lecturer of Talmud and Jewish philosophy in the Department of Humanities and Arts. He served in Israel's Medical Corps and fought in the 1982 Lebanon War. When the previous rabbi of the Technion decided leave his position, he advised the senate of the Technion to appoint Zini in his place. In 1980, Zini began serving as the rabbi of the Technion in addition to his position as a lecturer. In 2001, he founded Yeshivat Or Vishua, a hesder yeshiva located near the Technion. Zini currently lives with his wife and eight children in the Neve Sha'anan neighborhood of Haifa. ==Public Activities== Education and Research in Jewish Disciplines Rabbi Zini dedicates his time to disseminating Torah to the public. He began a program at the Technion which enabled students to add Torah study to their science and engineering studies. Zini's research in Torah-related fields focuses on books of the Geonim. Some of his research has been published in books, pamphlets, and articles. He has published series of books in Hebrew such as \\"Olamot BeIhudam\\" (\\"Worlds in their Unity\\"), \\"Erets Hemdatenu\\" (\\"Land of Our Desires\\"). He has published chidushim (original Torah thoughts) of Rashbatz on tractates Rosh Hashanah and Kinnim of the Babylonian Talmud, as well as \\"Magen Avot,\\" Rashbatz' commentary on Pirkei Avot. Similarly, he has published research on the history of halakha and the editing of the Talmud, such as \\"Rabanan Savora'ei ve-Klalei ha-Halakha\\" (\\"The Savoraim and the Rules of Halakha\\"). He has also published letters of Elijah Benamozegh, Hebrew translations of Professor Emmanuel Levinas, Hebrew translations of Rabbi L√©on Ashkenazi (with whom he was particularly close), and others. He also print*Olamot be-Ihudam ‚Äì ed new land of Israel editions of the \\"Tefilat he-Hadash\\" siddur and \\"Mo'adei Hashem\\" mahzor for the Shalosh Regalim (the Three Pilgrimage Festivals). Zini advocates for the joining of Torah study and science, claiming that it is fundamentally impossible for them to be contradictory. He opposes the methodology employed by Professor Nathan Aviezer in Aviezer's book \\"Bereishit Bara.\\" The book uses scientific fact to prove the accuracy of the Torah, while Zini does not believe that such explanations are necessary. Zini's method of Torah study is based on a broad knowledge of the literature of the Tanaim and Amoraim, a deeper study of the earlier sources in Midrash halakha, and only then a discussion of the words of the Talmud and Rishonim. In Talmud study, Zini uses the writings of the Geonim. Zini is also involved in philosophy. He met Professor Emmanuel Levinas in France and translated some of his essays. He published four of Levinas' articles in a pamphlet entitled \\"Divrei Emmanuel\\" (\\"The Words of Emmanuel\\") and cites him in his lectures. Encouragement of Aliyah and Absorption into Israel Rabbi Zini immigrated to Israel in 1970. He moved to Bnei Brak and began finishing his doctoral studies at the Technion. On his return to the Technion as an associate senior lecturer, Zini began activities to draw in the new immigrants from amongst the student body. A group of French immigrants formed the original basis of the minyan at the Technion synagogue. Rabbi of the Technion At the start of his operations at the Technion, Rabbi Zini acted privately, delivering lectures and organizing events for students. In 1980, the previous rabbi of the Technion, Rabbi Aharon She'ar-Yashuv, left the institution, recommending that Zini take his place. As rabbi of the Technion, Zini headed the organization of religious students there, called Ahvat Aharon. He opposed the plan to grant homosexual couples dorms reserved for married students. Once this plan was put into action, Zini ruled that the mezuzot must be removed from any of those dorms that were given to homosexual couples, though the institution did not comply.Kolbo, April 2009 In 2013, on reaching retirement age, he left his position. Political Stance Rabbi Zini is well known within the world view that sees the land of Israel as one of the foundations of Judaism, and it is within this world view that his political stance manifests itself. In November 1994, during the harsh debates within Israeli society over the Oslo Accords, he said in his weekly broadcast on Israeli news station Arutz Sheva: \\"Apparently God knows why the ways of the evildoers who currently run our country have succeeded, for apparently we and you did not do what He expected of us...Meanwhile, of the one primarily responsible for the deterioration of the situation, Mr. Rabin, it is said disgrace on your holiday tomorrow and those who celebrate with you, and may it be God's will to save us quickly from you and then there will be much peace for those who love His name and Torah.\\"Civil appeal Rabbi Dr. Eliyahu Zini vs. Kolbo, et. al. (Hebrew) Accessed 15 April 2015 In the libel suit which Zini brought against the local newspaper \\"Kolbo,\\" the judge ruled that the paper was guilty of libel against Zini, but only awarded him 1,000 NIS compensation, explaining: \\"From the material that is presented, the image arises of a man with extreme opinions, who is not averse to [making] statements bordering on incitement, using language that approaches‚Äîif not reaches‚Äîverbal abuse,\\" and adding: \\"And this is not a case of an innocent man upon whom guilt of incitement was cast. His opinions and style arouse hatred and separatism while causing difficult injuries to large parts of the population that do not share his world view, and the creation of polarization within society as directly connected to the advertisement under discussion should be taken into account when awarding the compensation.\\" Zini's appeal on the amount of compensation was rejected by the district court. One of Zini's essays appears in \\"Baruch ha-Gever\\" (a book written in memory of Baruch Goldstein) granting legitimacy to Rabbi Ido Elba's article \\"Beirur Halakhot Harigat Goy\\" (\\"An Inquiry into the Halakhot of Killing Gentiles\\"), an article which the Supreme Court of Israel deemed an inciter of racism. In an article published on 12 August 1995 in the newspaper \\"Aleh,\\" Zini wrote: \\"An ordinance of evacuation of civilian settlements is not only an illegal ordinance, but also an ordinance that assists the enemy... Any ordinance that assists the enemy... Any order of evacuation will be considered as carrying out the job of the enemy who desires the execution of this ordinance.\\" Zini opposed the statements of Rabbi Elazar Shach and the halakhic rulings of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef regarding the giving up of settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. He published a pamphlet entitled \\"Erets Hemdatenu\\" in which he argued that the sources cited by Rabbi Yosef to prove the permissibility of returning settlements in fact prove the opposite. Following the 2006 Lebanon War, Zini wrote: :One conclusion presents itself immediately, and that is the obligation that falls upon this wonderful generation, which managed with a high hand this battle with supreme dedication the likes of which we have not seen in 2000 years, to throw in history's trash bin this government, which is entirely a collection of scraps collected by a collector of weak politicians ready to [do] anything, a tyrannical collector who crushed in his path all ethical values and all national values, all to save his skin in the justice system which‚Äîas in the statement of former commander-in-chief Bugi Yaalon‚Äîapparently does not know mercy other than with its friends and friends of friends. Prior to the 2009 Israeli election, Zini wrote: \\"At least two goals must stand before our eyes in these elections: The first, support for those who defend the Torah and the Jewish identity, and the second, support for all those who defend the land of Israel and oppose with all their might a chain of terrible concessions that have already brought about enough bloodshed and enough disasters for the entire Israeli reality.\\" He recommended voting for The Jewish Home party or the National Union and was careful to note that \\"these matters are not the opinion of the other institution at which I work.\\" ==Books== Books Written by Rabbi Dr. Zini *Olamot be-Ihudam (Worlds in their Unity) **Volumes 1 ‚Äì 3: On religion and science, Judaism in reality, relations between secular and religion Jews, and Judaism and Zionism **Volume 4: On Passover in halahkha and thought *Rabanan Savora'ei u-Klalei ha-Halakha (The Savoraim and the Rules of Halakha) ‚Äì Talmudic research, Haifa 1992.

After capturing and saving Champaner, he continued his march upon Gujarat at the head of 80,000 horse. Soon Muhammad Shah II died and was succeeded by Kutb-ud- Din Ahmad Shah II. Mahmud Khilji had laid siege to Sult√°npur. Malik Ala-ud-din bin Sohr√°b, Kutb-ud-d√≠n's commander surrendered the fort, and was sent with honour to Malwa and appointed governor of Mandu. Mahmud Khilji, marching to Sarsa-Paldi, summoned Bharuch, then commanded by S√≠di Marj√°n on behalf of Gujar√°t Sultanate. The Sidi refused, and fearing delay, the Malwa Sultan after plundering Baroda (now Vadodara) proceeded to Nadiad, whose Br√°hmans astonished him by their bravery in killing a mad elephant. Kutb-ud-din Shah now advancing met Sultan Mahmud Khilji at Kapadvanj where, after a doubtful fight of some hours, Kutb-ud-din Shah defeated Sult√°n Mahmud Khilji. Muzaffar Kh√°n, who is said to have incited the Malwa Sultan Khilji to invade Gujarat, was captured and beheaded, and his head was hung up at the gate of Kapadvanj. In the same year, Sultan Mahmud Khalji attempted to conquer Nagor then held by Firuz Khan, a cousin of the Gujarat Sultan. Kutb-ud-din Shah despatched an army under the command of Sayad Ataullah, and, as it drew near Sambhar, the Malwa Sultan retired and shortly after Firuz Khan died. ==See also== * Vijaya Stambha ==References== Category:Kings of Malwa Category:Indian Muslims Category:15th-century Indian monarchs ","title":"Mahmud Khalji"},{"id":"46418488","text":"Jom√≠ Garc√≠a Ascot (24 March 1927 ‚Äì 14 August 1986) was a poet, essayist, filmmaker, director and educator. Born in Tunisia, he was a Spanish exile who lived in Mexico. ==Biography== Jos√© Miguel Garc√≠a Ascot was born on 24 March 1927 in Tunis, Tunisia. The son of a Spanish diplomat, he spent his childhood traveling from Portugal to France to Belgium and Morocco. Fleeing the Spanish Civil War with his parents, he arrived in Mexico in 1939 as an exile. Garc√≠a studied philosophy at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), where in 1949, he founded the University Film Club and earned a Master's in 1951. He also co-founded La Revista Presencia (Presence Magazine), where he began publishing poetry and film critiques. He taught at UNAM as well as at the Mexico City College and the French Institute of Latin America (IFAL). In 1952, he married Mar√≠a Luisa El√≠o, another Spanish exile living in Mexico. Garc√≠a collaborated with many publications, including Las Espa√±as (The Spanish), a publication of exilees; the Bolet√≠n de la Uni√≥n de Intelectuales Espa√±oles/M√©xico (Bulletin of the Union of Intellectuals Spanish / Mexico); M√©xico en la Cultura (Culture in Mexico); La Gaceta del Fondo de Cultura Economica (The Gazette of the Foundation of Economic Culture); Revista de la Universidad de M√©xico (Journal of the University of Mexico); and Prometeo (Prometheus). He was the director of the film magazine Cine Verdad, Telerevista y C√°mara. ==Film career== Between 1953 and 1957, he was director of several documentaries collaborating on works significant to the history of Spanish-language film, including Ra√≠ces (Roots) by Benito Alazraki, which won an award at the 1953 Cannes Film Festival; Torero (1956), by Carlos Velo; Nazar√≠n (1958), by Luis Bu√±uel; and Sonatas (1959) Juan Antonio Bardem. In 1958 he created, with his friends Jean-Fran√ßois Revel and Jos√© Luis Gonz√°lez, the Mexican Cinema Club at the French Institute for Latin America (IFAL), which was highly regarded at the time. In 1956, he was invited to work on the production of Cine-Verdad (Cinema of Truth) with Manuel Barbachano Ponce. In the early 1960s, a group of leftist scholars who were aspiring filmmakers formed what they dubbed Nuevo Cine (New Film). Members of the group included Garc√≠a Ascot, Jos√© de la Colina, Salvador Elizondo, Emilio Garc√≠a Riera, and Carlos Monsiv√°is, who served on the executive board. They were later joined by Jorge Ayala Blanco, Rafael Corkidi, Manuel Gonz√°lez Casanova, Salom√≥n Laiter, Paul Leduc, Manuel Michel, Jos√© Maria Sbert, and Tom√°s P√©rez Turrent. The goal of the group was to revive and rejuvenate the stagnant Mexican film industry, which had no training facilities for young film aspirants, no archive, and no real interest in developing new talent. In 1960, he was invited to go to Cuba and participate in a film, Cuba 58 being filmed there. He created two short films, Un D√≠a de Trabajo (A Day of Work, 17 minutes), Los Novios (The Betrothed, 32 minutes) in 1961 which in 1962 were combined with a short, A√±o Nuevo (The New Year, 29 minutes) by Jorge Fraga to create Cuba 58. Originally five segments were planned for the film, but the final composition contains only these three. Garc√≠a began working on a new project, a musical comedy in the style of West Side Story, but had to abandon the project as the political situation in Cuba deteriorated. Returning to Mexico with his wife, Garc√≠a began working in a collaboration with her and Emilio Garc√≠a Riera to produce one of the first films about Spanish exilees. The film, El bac√≥n vac√≠o (The Empty Balcony) is the autobiographical story of Garc√≠a's wife, Mar√≠a Luisa El√≠o, who wrote the script of the film. Shooting only on weekends because the trio all had regular jobs, the film took a year to produce and was not a commercial success, though it did win awards. He directed the short film Remedios Varo in 1967 (about the painter of the same name, Remedios Varo), which won a Golden Sombrero Award at the Second International Festival The film was narrated by his wife, but it was their last joint project, as they divorced in 1968. He wrote and directed the short El viaje (The Trip) in 1977, which was his only commercial film. ==Writing career== After his failure to make a commercial success of his film making, Garc√≠a returned to writing. Initially, he wrote poetry, publishing Un oto√±o en el aire (An Autumn in the Air) (1964), Estar aqu√≠ (Being Here) (1966), Seis poemas al margen (Six Poems at the Margin) (1972) and others. Garc√≠a wrote several non-fiction works, including essays on the story of the life of painter Roger von Gunten (1978) and another on the life of the poet, Baudelaire (1951). He also authored a book about music, Con la m√∫sica por dentro (With the Music Inside) (1982). He also began working on a novel, La muerte empieza en Polanco (Death Begins in Polanco), which was published posthumously. In 1965-66, Garc√≠a Ascot was a neighbor of the writer, Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez. During the eighteen months that Garc√≠a M√°rquez worked on his book One Hundred Years of Solitude, Garc√≠a Ascot and his wife visited Garc√≠a M√°rquez's house each night and critiqued the story as it developed. Garc√≠a M√°rquez dedicated the book to the couple with the inscription \\"Para (to) Jom√≠ Garc√≠a Ascot y Mar√≠a Luisa El√≠o\\". Garc√≠a Ascot died in Mexico City on 14 August 1986. ==Selected works== Garc√≠a wrote both fiction and scholarly works, as well as poetry. His film, En el balc√≥n vac√≠o (In the Empty Balcony) won the Critics Award at the Locarno International Film Festival (1962) and Giano d'Oro in the Festival of Latin American Cinema of Sestri Levante (1963), though it was never shown commercially.

It was released by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 1495‚Äì1501 in its catalogues. ==Plot== A bearded stranger, carrying a single valise, arrives at a seaside boarding house. The janitor in charge shows him to an unfurnished room, still being papered. Once the janitor has left, the new tenant throws the paper hanger out the window, and fills the room with a vast assortment of things magically taken from his valise: a steamer trunk larger than the valise itself, a fireplace, chairs, a piano, various decorations and hangings, a fully set dining table, and even a whole family and a housemaid. The janitor, bringing in a small tray of food, is astonished to see the tenant and family enjoying a grand dinner in the magically furnished room. He runs away in flight. Later, the tenant is reading a newspaper by the fireplace, when the janitor comes in to present the tenant with his bill. The tenant, indicating that he has no money, rejects the bill and leaves the janitor alone in the room, where all the furniture comes alive. The panicked janitor rushes back to his office and alerts his female partner. Back in the room, the tenant quickly packs most of the furniture into the steamer trunk, which itself disappears into the valise. A policeman runs in to stop the tenant from escaping, but the tenant throws him inside the piano and into the trunk with the rest. Leaving only a small chest of drawers in the room, the tenant pulls a ladder from his valise and climbs out the window. The male janitor hurries in, accompanied by the owner of the building and another policeman. Finding only the chest of drawers, which is dancing around of its own accord, the three men attack it with sticks. It explodes in a huge burst of smoke, knocking the men to the ground and bringing plaster and beams down from the ceiling. ==Cast== M√©li√®s's films have no closing credits, but the following cast list can be reconstructed from recollections by Georges M√©li√®s's son, Andr√© M√©li√®s. * Georges M√©li√®s as the diabolic tenant. M√©li√®s acted in at least 300 of his 520 films. * Andr√© M√©li√®s as the family's young child. The previous year, when he was seven years old, he had played the lead role in his father's film A Grandmother's Story. Andr√© M√©li√®s grew up to be a professional actor and operetta singer, and played his father in Georges Franju's 1952 biographical film Le Grand M√©li√®s. * Fran√ßois Lallement as the young soldier in the family. Lallement was one of M√©li√®s's salaried cameramen; he had previously appeared onscreen as the officer of marines in A Trip to the Moon. * Charles Claudel as the male janitor. Claudel was one of the artists who painted scenery based on M√©li√®s's designs. * Octavie Huvier as the female janitor. Huvier was a maidservant for the M√©li√®s family. ==Production== The Diabolic Tenant is an expanded treatment of plot ideas that had previously appeared in an earlier M√©li√®s film, Satan in Prison. M√©li√®s's concept of large things coming from a small bag returned in later films, including Walt Disney's Mary Poppins and Jerry Lewis's Hardly Working. The film's special effects were created using pyrotechnics, stage machinery, and furniture props moved by people hidden inside them, including the young Andr√© M√©li√®s. The only cinematic effect used in the film is the editing technique known as the substitution splice. As is typical for M√©li√®s's work, most of the action is filmed in long shots. Unusually, the actors also briefly come closer to the camera, in medium shot‚Äîprobably to clarify the action by showing the janitor's expression of astonishment more clearly. John Frazer, in a 1979 book on M√©li√®s, argued that The Diabolic Tenant could be read as an autobiographical film about the director's own financial difficulties. A 1981 Centre national de la cin√©matographie guide to M√©li√®s's films disputes Frazer's interpretation, noting that it is mistaken on plot details and arguing that M√©li√®s was not in serious financial trouble until he began business negotiations with Path√© Fr√®res in 1911. ==References * Category:Films directed by Georges M√©li√®s Category:French films Category:1909 films Category:French silent short films Category:Silent films in color ","title":"The Diabolic Tenant"},{"id":"46418570","text":"Nancy Makri (born September 5, 1962) is the Edward William and Jane Marr Gutgsell Endowed Professor of Chemistry and Physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, where she is the principal investigator of the Makri Research Group for the theoretical understanding of condensed phase quantum dynamics. She studies theoretical quantum dynamics of polyatomic systems, and has developed methods for long-time numerical path integral simulations of quantum dissipative systems. ==Early life and education== Nancy Makri was born in Athens, Greece on September 5, 1962. She graduated from the University of Athens in 1985 with a B.S. in Chemistry, after working with Professor C. A. Nicolaides. She then attended the University of California at Berkeley and received her Ph.D. in 1989 under the direction of William H. Miller. Her thesis title was Theoretical methods for the study of chemical dynamics. In 1992 she married physical chemist Martin Gruebele. ==Career== Makri spent two years as a Junior Fellow at Harvard University, from 1989-1991. She joined the Chemistry faculty of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1992. In 1996 she became Associate Professor with tenure, and in 1999, Professor of Chemistry and Physics. She is the principal investigator of the Makri Research Group for the theoretical understanding of condensed phase quantum dynamics, and has co-authored over 100 scientific articles. She is also an affiliate of the Beckman Institute for Science and Technology. Makri works in the area of theoretical chemical physics. She has developed new theoretical approaches to simulating the dynamics of quantum mechanical phenomena. Makri has developed novel methods for calculating numerically exact path integrals for the simulation of system dynamics in harmonic dissipative environments. Her simulation algorithms address the limitations of the Schr√∂dinger equation, which can only describe physical changes exactly in the quantum state of small molecules. By identifying aspects of simulations which can be effectively simplified, Dr. Makri's group have developed \\"the first fully quantum mechanical methodology for calculating the evolution of a quantum system in a dissipative environment by performing an iterative decomposition of Feynman‚Äôs path integral expression\\". Such simplifications make it possible to calculate outcomes that otherwise would not be mathematically feasible. Her careful examinations of the system- harmonic bath model have resulted in techniques for avoiding the Monte Carlo sign problem. The ability to model proton and electron transfer reactions has been successfully applied to biological systems such as the quantum simulation of electron transfer in bacterial photosynthesis, offering \\"a complete and unambiguous picture of the process\\". More recent work has focused on developing a methodology for forward-backward semiclassical dynamics using classical trajectory calculations. This approach has been used to model the activity of helium in both normal and superfluid phases, examining Bose- statistical effects in relationship to phase transitions. ==Awards== Makri has received a number of awards and honors, including the following: * Arnold O. Beckman Research Award, University of Illinois Research Board, 2003 * Fellow, American Physical Society, 2001, \\"For developing novel real time path integral methods and decisively quantifying how condensed phase environments affect quantum barrier crossing and biological charge transfer.\\" * Academic Prize in Physical Sciences, Bodossaki Foundation, 2000 * Agnes Fay Morgan Research Award, 1999, \\"for her work with photosynthesis and the charge transfer reactions which occur in photosynthetic systems\\" * Fellow, American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1998 * Camille Dreyfus Teacher Scholar Award, 1997 * Annual Medal of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science, 1995 * Cottrell Scholar Award, 1994 * Sloan Research Fellowship, 1994 * David and Lucille Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering, 1993 * National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award, 1993 * Beckman Young Investigators Award, 1993 ==References Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century physicists Category:21st-century physicists Category:20th-century women scientists Category:21st-century women scientists Category:Greek women physicists Category:Greek physicists Category:National and Kapodistrian University of Athens alumni Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign faculty Category:People from the Athens Urban Area Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society ","title":"Nancy Makri"},{"id":"46418592","text":"Georgi Ivanovich Zharkov (; born 19 August 1918 in Bogorodsk; died 19 October 1981 in Moscow) was a Soviet Russian football player and coach. ==Honours== * Soviet Top League bronze: 1945. * Soviet Cup winner: 1949. * Soviet Cup finalist: 1947. ==External links== * Category:1918 births Category:People from Noginsk Category:1981 deaths Category:Soviet footballers Category:Soviet Top League players Category:FC Torpedo Moscow players Category:Soviet football managers Category:FC Zenit Saint Petersburg managers Category:FC Torpedo Moscow managers Category:FC Ararat Yerevan managers Category:FC Ural Yekaterinburg managers Category:Neft√ßi PFK managers Category:Association football forwards Category:FC Iskra Smolensk players ","title":"Georgi Zharkov"},{"id":"46418619","text":"The contributions of women in climate change have received increasing attention in the early 21st century.

A report by the World Health Organization concluded that incorporating gender-based analysis would \\"provide more effective climate change mitigation and adaptation.\\" ==Introduction== Mary Robinson Christiana Figueres Women have made major contributions to climate change research and policy and to broader analysis of global environmental issues. They include many women scientists as well as policy makers and activists. Women researchers have made significant contributions to major scientific assessments such as those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and are reasonably well represented on key global change committees of the International Council for Science (ICSU) and US National Academy of Sciences. Women have played important leadership roles in international climate policy. For example, Christiana Figueres leads the international climate negotiations as the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and former Irish President Mary Robinson is the UN Special Envoy on Climate Change. Susan Solomon chaired the climate science working group 1 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment in 2007. ==Underrepresentation of women in science== Women are generally underrepresented in science and have faced many barriers to their success and recognition. Following the scientific revolution in the 17th century European women became involved in observational science, including astronomy, natural history and weather observations although many universities would not admit women until the late 19th century. The latest report from the US National Science Foundation shows that while women are now earning half of the undergraduate degrees in science and engineering, most of these are in the biosciences (especially pre-med) compared to physics, computer sciences and engineering (20%). In terms of doctorates, women are also only 20% of the engineering and physics PhDs. Although the proportion of women full professors in the US has doubled since 1993 women occupy less than 1/4 of senior faculty positions in science and engineering and women earn less than men at the same level. It has been noted that women of color, indigenous women and women from the global south are even more likely to be overlooked, to be poorly represented in the academy and leadership. This is associated with a legacy of discrimination, lack of educational opportunities, language barriers, and a lack of effort to identify and cite them. ==Women in climate change disciplines== Women are underrepresented in key disciplines for the study of climate change. For example, women are a minority in the earth sciences where surveys reveal that less than 20% of meteorologists and geoscientists are women. A recent analysis of US atmospheric science doctoral programs reveals that women were 17% of tenure track and tenured faculty, with even smaller proportions at higher rank, and 53% of departments had two or fewer women faculty. Women are slightly better represented in the ecological sciences. One study reports that women are 55% of graduate students in ecology but only 1/3 of tenured faculty are women and that 3/4 of the articles in the flagship international journal - Ecology - are written by men. Women received proportionally less research funding and were less likely to be cited by their colleagues. Women members of the Ecological Society of America increased from 23% in 1992 to 37% in 2010. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization publishes data on women in science worldwide. Overall women are better represented as a share of total scientific researchers in Latin America, Oceania and Europe (30%+) and least in Asia (19%). ==Arguments for women in science and climate change== It is argued that when women are overlooked as scholars and decision makers the world fails to take advantage of its full human capacity, which is needed for issues as urgent as climate change. Women may also take more collaborative approaches, especially in negotiations, and may pay more attention to disadvantaged groups and to the natural environment. Gender has become an issue because of women's essential roles in managing resources such as water, forests and energy and as women lead fights for environmental protection. A general concern has been expressed about the need to highlight the work of women and to include more women in major committees in order to provide gender balance, social justice, and inspiration to young women to enter careers in science. This reflects more general arguments about the barriers to women's advancement and the need for women to 'Lean in' to leadership positions.(e.g. Lean In) Susan Solomon ==Women and international climate policy== The outcome document of the Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable Development - the Future we Want - recognized the need to remove barriers to the full and equal participation of women in decision making and management and the need to increase women in leadership positions. A report prepared by UN Women, the Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice, the Global Gender and Climate Alliance and the UNFCCC recognizes the structural inequalities that impede the representation of women in climate science, negotiations and policies and recommends greater gender balance in the UNFCCC and national delegations. The report argues that the 'challenges of climate change cannot be solved without empowering women' and that women have been marginalized in international negotiations. It reports data that show weak representation of women in the institutions of the UNFCCC including the Adaptation Committee (25%), the GEF Council (19%) and the Expert Group (15%) and that overall women constitute less than 20% of delegation heads and less than 30% of delegation members at UNFCCC conferences. == The Manthropocene == A call for international science to pay greater attention to the inclusion of women scholars was made by Kate Raworth and then in her article \\"Must the Anthropocene be the Manthropocene?\\" She pointed out that the working group of 36 scientists and scholars who convened in Berlin in 2014 to begin assessing evidence humanity was entering a new epoch, the Anthropocene, was composed almost entirely of men. She stated: \\"Leading scientists may have the intellect to recognize that our planetary era is dominated by human activity, but they still seem oblivious to the fact that their own intellectual deliberations are bizarrely dominated by white northern male voices\\". ==Women working in climate change== There are a variety of ways to identify women who have made major contributions to climate change. The first is the list of authors of the high level international assessments for the UN and other organizations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The second is to examine women who have been invited to join the editorial boards of climate change refereed journals. A third is to look at the membership of the global change committees of the International Council for Science (ICSU). And a fourth is to recognize women that are members of their National Academy of Sciences who work on climate change. Many of them are IPCC or other report authors, and also members of ICSU committees, members of their National Academy and other marks of accomplishment. ==Ecofeminism== This is a branch of feminism that sees environmentalism and the relationship between women and the earth as interlinked. Currently, young girls are taking more action at a younger age which is also known as the \\"Greta Thunberg effect.\\" Greta Thunberg is a sixteen-year-old environmental activist, who is well known for her work on fighting climate change, and is seen as a role model for younger girls. These new generations of girls are being called \\"eco-warriors\\", they are taking actions for the environment in various ways. In Kazakhstan, a group of young girls named Team Coco have come together to fight the ecological problems that pollute their nation, in order to accomplish this they have created an app known as TECO which is an \\"augmented reality game that merges educational and entertainment tools to help players change their behavior and become more eco-conscious.\\" More girls have been taking action against climate change by using technology, and in turn help encourage other political leaders to take action for climate change and business corporations to reduce the carbon foot print they leave behind. ==Women climate researchers== *Karin B√§ckstrand: Professor of Political Science at Stockholm University, Sweden who has written extensively on climate and environmental governance and advises the ICSU Earth System Governance project. *Michele Betsill: Professor of Political Science at Colorado State University in the USA who is an expert on cities and climate change and transnational forms of climate governance.

For the general case, if the base is compact, choose E such that E ‚äï E is trivial. Choose F in the same way. Then let E ‚äó F be the subbundle of (E ‚äï E) ‚äó (F ‚äï F) with the desired fibers. Finally, use the approximation argument to handle a non-compact base. See Hatcher for a general direct approach. Example: If O is a trivial line bundle, then E ‚äó O = E for any E. Example: E ‚äó E ‚àó is canonically isomorphic to the endomorphism bundle End(E), where E ‚àó is the dual bundle of E. Example: A line bundle L has tensor inverse: in fact, L ‚äó L ‚àó is (isomorphic to) a trivial bundle by the previous example, as End(L) is trivial. Thus, the set of the isomorphism classes of all line bundles on some topological space X forms an abelian group called the Picard group of X. == Variants == One can also define a symmetric power and an exterior power of a vector bundle in a similar way.

Following his early education in Lebanon, he attended college in Assiut, Egypt. In 1891 he married Katherine Saba, and they immigrated to the United States from Alexandria, Egypt in 1893. While residing temporarily in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with his wife's brother's family, Diab wrote for Kawkab America, the United States' first Arabic language newspaper. The Diab family moved to New York City, the center of early Arab-American journalism, in 1894. By 1898 Diab was Managing Editor of Kawkab America, and in 1899 he founded and became Managing Editor and Publisher of the newspaper Meraat-ul- Gharb (Mirror of the West), dedicating the paper \\"to speak for Arabism.\\" The newspaper gained a wide national and international readership and by 1911 was considered \\"the best Arabic Newspaper\\" published in the United States. In 1902 the Ottoman Government issued a warrant for his arrest, confiscated his property in Lebanon and sentenced him to death in absentia citing his editorials as encouraging revolution in the Empire. In 1908 Meraat-ul-Gharb was reported as \\"one of the instruments which incited the Turkish military to its recent revolt\\" against the Sultan's Government. Diab was an early activist for Arab independence, first supporting a confederation of Arab States within the Ottoman Empire, and, after World War I, secular republican Arab governments. In June 1913 he was a delegate from America's United Syrian Society, of which he was President and a founding member, to the Arab Congress of 1913, in Paris. In his speech to the Congress, \\"The Aspirations of the Syrian Emigrants,\\" Diab called for semiautonomous status for Greater Syria within the Ottoman Empire, a strategy that has been called \\"using the Ottoman Empire as a shield from European ambitions\\" in the Arab region. Following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, Diab, in 1919, opposed a French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, and was strongly against France's perceived role as speaking on behalf of the region at the post World War I Paris Peace Conference. In the early 1920s Diab's editorials in Meraat-ul-Gharb focused on encouragement of an increased Arab nationalist identity based on non-sectarian divisions, and non-intervention by the European nations. By 1925, Diab supported the Arab revolt against French political rule, writing in Meraat-ul- Gharb: \\"Today the whole world listens to the voice of Syria‚Ä¶even France listens, which has met their every plea with contempt and disdain.\\" He called for a republic in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine, writing in 1928, \\"‚Ä¶the nations of the East, which have tasted the bitterness of individual rule in the past need no proof of its harmfulness.\\" Diab advocated immigrant rights in America, and Meraat-ul-Gharb took a strong stand in support of the 1912 Lawrence Textile Strike, during which two Syrian-Americans were killed. He encouraged Arab-American political participation in the United States, supporting perhaps the first Arab-American candidate for public office, Anton Simon, a 1910 GOP candidate for the New York State Senate. He rallied public support, with other notable Arab-Americans in the victory for Arab-American rights to citizenship culminating in the Dow v. United States 1915 Fourth Circuit Court decision affirming these rights. Throughout his life in the United States, Diab encouraged the mahjar (√©migr√©) literary movement. Meraat- ul-Gharb, through its associated printing house, Meraat Press, published the first Arabic novel in the United States, Salim Sarkis' al-Qulub al-Muttahida fi'l-Wilayat al-Muttahida (United Hearts in the United States) in 1904, and was the primary publisher of the Arabic work of major Lebanese-Syrian √©migr√© writers, including Mikhail Naimy, Kahlil Gibran, and the poet Iliya Abu Madi (Elia D.Madey). In 1918, Abu Madi became Chief Editor of the paper, and married Diab's eldest daughter, Dorothy. Najeeb Diab had five daughters and a son, and died in Brooklyn, New York on July 11, 1936. ==References== Category:1870 births Category:1936 deaths Category:Lebanese emigrants to the United States ","title":"Najeeb Diab"},{"id":"46418747","text":"Krasnaya Zarya Leningrad was the previous name of two sports clubs in Saint Petersburg, Russia: * BSK Saint Petersburg, bandy club * FC Elektrosila Leningrad, football club ","title":"Krasnaya Zarya Leningrad"},{"id":"46418772","text":"Brian Tesler (born 19 February 1929) is a British television producer and executive. His career encompassed British television's post-war evolution from a single-channel BBC to the beginning of today‚Äôs multitude of cable and satellite channels. He worked as a producer for Independent Television, as well as the BBC. Tesler joined BBC Television as a trainee Light Entertainment producer in 1952 and was put in charge of the Department's output of panel games, both finding and producing them, which he proceeded to do by introducing Guess My Story, Find the Link, The Tall Story Club and The Name's the Same. He devised the Billy Cotton Band Show, inventing Billy Cotton's \\"Wakey! Wakey!\\" catchphrase, and worked with The Television Toppers who were the dancers on the early series of the show. He devised British Television's first request show Ask Pickles with Wilfred Pickles. He worked with stage and screen stars such as Gracie Fields, Julie Andrews, Tony Bennett, Bob Hope and Mario Lanza. As a technician, he worked with The Leslie Roberts Dancers which became The Leslie Roberts Silhouettes after technology on which he had been working.The Greatest Billy Cotton Band Show by John Maxwell (1976) p.108-111. Jupiter Books (London) Ltd.) With fellow ex-trainee Ernest Maxin he co- produced and directed the first television comedy series by Frank Muir and Denis Norden, And So to Bentley, starring Dick Bentley, Peter Sellers and Bill Fraser. He produced series with Bob Monkhouse, Petula Clark, and Bathnight with Braden, starring Bernard Braden and written by Muir and Norden, which was BBC Television's first weekly comedy series, such shows until then only being broadcast fortnightly. At ATV from 1957 to 1960, Tesler took over Sunday Night at the London Palladium, with Bruce Forsyth as host. He produced specials built round such international artistes as Rosemary Clooney and Johnnie Ray, devised and produced series of Val Parnell's Saturday Spectaculars with Max Bygraves, Dickie Henderson, Arthur Askey, Harry Secombe and Dave King, and devised and produced New Look, a revue with a team of new performers including Roy Castle, whose television career the series began. In 1957, he received BAFTA's first award for Light Entertainment Production when the Academy was still the Society of Film and Television Arts. His last production was Sammy Davis Jr's first show for British TV in 1960. As Director of Programmes at ABC-TV and Thames Television during the 1960s and 1970s, he oversaw the first British television shows of Frank Sinatra, Jack Benny, Peggy Lee and Bing Crosby. He introduced ITV's first weekly series dedicated to the arts with Tempo; British television's first late night chat show with Eamonn Andrews Live from London and its first hidden camera show Candid Camera (based on the American original) with Bob Monkhouse. Programmes he commissioned included Thank Your Lucky Stars, Callan, The Benny Hill Show, Public Eye and The World at War.http://www.historytoday.com/taylor-downing/world-war Tesler was a founder-director of both Thames Television and Channel 4; managing director and then chairman and managing director of London Weekend Television; and the founder-chairman of ITV's first venture into satellite broadcasting with SuperChannel. During his career, he worked for four superiors: Ronnie Waldman, Lew Grade, Howard Thomas and John Freeman; and when he became a broadcasting boss himself he appointed four future significant figures: Jeremy Isaacs as his Controller of Features at Thames; Michael Grade, John Birt and Greg Dyke successively as his Directors of Programmes at LWT. Tesler retired in 1994, and has written two books about his life and career. The first, Before I Forget, published in 2006, described his family life, growing up in London's East End Jewish community before and during the Second World War.

Osterhout was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Reverend John Van Leuven Osterhout, a Baptist minister, and Annie Loranthe Beman. His mother and infant sister died in 1873, leaving his father to raise him alone. However, this proved difficult and so Winthrop was given to his grandmother in Baltimore to raise until the age of eight. His father having remarried, he returned to live with John and his wife in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1889 he entered Brown University where he developed an interest in botany. He joined the staff of Brown University in 1893, where he taught botany for two years and graduated with an M.A. in 1894. He studied at Bonn, Germany for a year, then returned home in 1896 and moved to California. In 1899 he received a Ph.D. at the University of California with a dissertation on Rhabdonia, whereupon he married his first wife, Anna Maria Landstrom. The couple would have two daughters: Anna Maria and Olga. At the University of California, he was promoted to assistant professor from 1901 to 1908 then associate professor of botany 1908-1909\\\\. In 1909, he moved to Harvard University as an assistant professor of botany, taking a step down in rank but being closer to the important Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole.

Novorossiya (; ; ), literally New Russia but sometimes called South Russia, is a historical term of the Russian Empire denoting a region north of the Black Sea (now part of Ukraine). In Ukraine the territory was better known as Stepovyna (Steppeland) or Nyz (Lower land).Mikhail Levchenko. Hanshchyna (–ì–∞–Ω—å—â–∏–Ω–∞ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞). Opyt russko- ukrainskago slovariÔ∏†aÔ∏°. Tip.

It was formed as a new imperial province of Russia (Novorossiya Governorate) in 1764 from military frontier regions along with parts of the southern Hetmanate in preparation for war with the Ottomans.Magocsi, Paul R. \\"A History of Ukraine: The Land and Its Peoples,\\" p. 284. It was further expanded by the annexation of the Zaporizhian Sich in 1775. At various times it encompassed the Moldavian region of Bessarabia, the modern Ukraine's regions of the Black Sea littoral (Prychornomoria), Zaporizhia, Tavria, the Azov Sea littoral (Pryazovia), the Tatar region of Crimea, the Nogai steppe at the Kuban River, and the Circassian lands. The region was part of the Russian Empire until its collapse following the Russian February Revolution in early March 1917, after which it became part of the short-lived Russian Republic. In 1918, it was largely included in the Ukrainian State and in the Ukrainian Soviet Republic at the same time. In 1918‚Äì1920, it was, to varying extents, under the control of the anti-Bolshevik White movement governments of South Russia whose defeat signified the Soviet control over the territory, which became part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, within the Soviet Union from 1922. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, there have been attempts to revive Novorossiya, the most significant of which has been the pro-Russian separatist movement to create a Novorossiyan confederation with the subsequent War in Donbass. ==History== Ukraine 1648 (south on top) with a broad belt of \\"loca deserta\\", Latin for desolated areas Map of the Wild Fields in the 17th century Lands of Zaporizhian Host in 1760 Novorossiya Governorate of Russian Empire. Its central city was Ekaterinoslav (modern Dnipro), which was briefly renamed \\"Novorossiysk\\" during the reign of Paul I The modern history of the region follows the fall of the Golden Horde. The eastern portion was claimed by the Crimean Khanate (one of its multiple successors), while its western regions were divided between Moldavia and Lithuania. With the expansion of the Ottoman Empire, the whole Black Sea northern littoral region came under the control of the Crimean Khanate that in turn became a vassal of the Ottomans. Sometime in the 16th century the Crimean Khanate allowed the Nogai Horde which were displaced from its native Volga region by Muscovites and Kalmyks to settle in the Black Sea steppes. Vast regions to the North of the Black Sea were sparsely populated and were known as the Wild Fields (as translated from Polish or Ukrainian) Dykra (in Lithuanian) or Loca deserta (\\"desolated places\\") in Latin on medieval maps. There were, however, many settlements along the Dnieper River. The Wild Fields had covered roughly the southern territories of modern Ukraine; some say they extended into the modern Southern Russia (Rostov Oblast). The Russian Empire gradually gained control over the area, signing peace treaties with the Cossack Hetmanate and with the Ottoman Empire at the conclusion of the Russo-Turkish Wars of 1735‚Äì39, 1768‚Äì74, 1787‚Äì92 and 1806‚Äì12. In 1764 the Russian Empire established the Novorossiysk Governorate; it was originally to be named after the Empress Catherine, but she decreed that it should be called New Russia instead. Its administrative centre was at St. Elizabeth fortress (today, Kropyvnytskyi) in order to protect the southern borderlands from the Ottoman Empire, and in 1765 this passed to Kremenchuk. The rulers of Novorossiya gave out land generously to the Russian nobility (dvoryanstvo) and the enserfed peasantry‚Äîmostly from the Ukraine and fewer from Russia‚Äîto encourage immigration for the cultivation of the then sparsely populated steppe. According to the Historical Dictionary of Ukraine: There was an initial endeavour to colonize the region with several ethnic groups, of which the most numerous were Romanians and Ruthenians (Ukrainians). East of the Southern Bug river, in the region formerly called New Serbia, in 1757 the largest ethnic group were Romanians at 75%, followed by Serbs at 12% and 13% others. After the annexation of the Ottoman territories to Novorossiya in 1774, the Russian authorities commenced an aggressive program of colonization, encouraging large migrations from a broader spectrum of ethnic groups. Catherine the Great invited European settlers to these newly conquered lands: Romanians (from Moldavia, Wallachia and Transylvania), Bulgarians, Serbs, Greeks, Albanians, Germans, Poles, Italians, and others. In 1775, the Russian Empress Catherine the Great forcefully liquidated the Zaporizhian Sich and annexed its territory to Novorossiya, thus eliminating the independent rule of the Ukrainian Cossacks. Prince Grigori Potemkin (1739‚Äì1791) directed the Russian colonization of the land at the end of 18th century. Catherine the Great granted him the powers of an absolute ruler over the area from 1774. The spirit and importance of New Russia at this time is aptly captured by the historian Willard Sunderland, In 1792, the Russian government declared that the region between the Dniester and the Bug was to become a new principality named \\"New Moldavia\\", under Russian suzerainty.E. Lozovan, Romanii orientali, \\"Neamul Romanesc\\", 1/1991, p.14 According to the first Russian census of the Yedisan region conducted in 1793 (after the expulsion of the Nogai Tatars) 49 villages out of 67 between the Dniester and the Southern Bug were Romanian.E. Lozovan, Romanii orientali, \\"Neamul Romanesc\\", 1/1991, p.32. A historical German map of Novorossiya 1855 The ethnic composition of Novorossiya changed during the beginning of the 19th century due to the intensive movement of colonists who rapidly created towns, villages, and agricultural colonies. During the Russo-Turkish Wars, the major Turkish fortresses of Ozu-Cale, Akkerman, Khadzhibey, Kinburn and many others were conquered and destroyed. New cities and settlements were established in their places. Over time the ethnic composition varied. Multiple ethnicities participated in the founding of the cities of Novorossiya (most of these cities were expansions of older settlementsOdesa: Through Cossacks, Khans and Russian Emperors, The Ukrainian Week (18 November 2014)). For example: * Zaporizhia as formerly the site of a Cossack fort * Odessa, founded in 1794 on the site of a Tatar village (the first recorded mention of a settlement located in current Odessa was in 1415) by a Spanish general in Russian service, Jose de Ribas, had a French mayor, Richelieu (in office 1803‚Äì1814) * Donetsk, founded in 1869, was originally named Yuzovka (Yuzivka) in honor of John Hughes, the Welsh industrialist who developed the coal region of the Donbass According to the report of governor Shmidt, the ethnic composition of Kherson Governorate and the city of Odessa in 1851 was as follows:–®–º–∏–¥—Ç –ê. \\"–ú–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—ã –¥–ª—è –≥–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–∏ –∏ —Å—Ç–∞—Ç–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∏, —Å–æ–±—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –æ—Ñ–∏—Ü–µ—Ä–∞–º–∏ –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ —à—Ç–∞–±–∞. –•–µ—Ä—Å–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –≥—É–±–µ—Ä–Ω–∏—è. –ß–∞—Å—Ç—å 1\\".

The initial conception had not developed exact borders, but focus centred on the Odessan, Mykolaiv, Kherson, and Crimean oblasts, with eventually other oblasts joining as well. The name received renewed emphasis when Russian President Vladimir Putin stated in an interview on 17 April 2014 that the territories of Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Odessa were part of what was called Novorossiya. In May 2014, the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic proclaimed the confederation of Novorossiya and its desire to extend its control towards all of southeastern Ukraine. The confederation had little practical unity and within a year the project was abandoned: on 1 January 2015 the founding leadership announced the project had been put on hold, and on 20 May the constituent members announced the freezing of the political project. ==See also== * Donetsk‚ÄìKrivoy Rog Soviet Republic * Federal State of New Russia * Little Russia * Great Russia * White Russia * New Serbia * Slavo- Serbia * Russian irredentism ==NotesReferences *Map of Novorossiya (New Russia) *Novorossiya leaders and Odessa mayors Category:Historical regions in Russia Category:Zaporizhia (region) Category:Historical regions in Moldova Category:Russians in Ukraine Category:Russian irredentism ","title":"Novorossiya"},{"id":"46419317","text":"Boris Ivanovich Ivin (; born in 1909 in St. Petersburg; died in 1942 in Kazan) was a Soviet Russian football player and coach. ==External links== * Category:1909 births Category:Footballers from Saint Petersburg Category:1942 deaths Category:Soviet footballers Category:FC Zenit Saint Petersburg players Category:Soviet football managers Category:FC Zenit Saint Petersburg managers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Association football forwards ","title":"Boris Ivin"},{"id":"46419325","text":"Robert Johnson (born August 1, 1953) is an American accountant from his native Jacksonville, Arkansas, who is a Democratic member of the Arkansas House of Representatives for District 42 in a portion of Pulaski County outside the capital city of Little Rock. ==Background== Johnson received a Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting from the University of Central Arkansas in Conway in Faulkner County and a Master of Science in accounting at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. Since 1990, he has maintained a Certified Public Accounting practice in Jacksonville, where he resides with his wife, Laurie Anne Johnson (born c. 1963), and their five children, Baxter, Taylor, Aaron, Nick and Ben. He is affiliated with Rotary International, Boys and Girls Clubs, the Chamber of Commerce, the Sertoma Club, and Ducks Unlimited. He is a member of the First Baptist Church in Jacksonville. ==Political life== Johnson was a lifelong Republican who served ten years as a justice of the peace in the Pulaski County Quorum Court until 2014, when in 2013 he switched parties to seek the state legislative seat vacated by the term-limited Mark W. Perry. He ran unopposed for the House in both the Democratic nomination and in the November 4, 2014 general election. Johnson calls himself a Moderate Republican turned Conservative Democrat. He criticized the majority of Arkansas legislative Republicans for their conservative positions on issues. Johnson said that his father had been a supporter of former Governor Winthrop Rockefeller, a two-term Moderate Republican who was unseated in 1970 by the Democrat Dale Bumpers. In making his party switch, Johnson gained the backing of Will Bond, the Democratic state chairman who had preceded Mark Perry in the District 42 House seat. Johnson holds these committee assignments: (1) Public Transportation (2) Aging, Children, and Youth, Legislative and Military Affairs, and (3) Joint Committee on Public Retirement and Social Security Programs. In the 2015 legislative session, Johnson supported an increase in public school teacher pay but did not vote on the religious freedom legislation, House Bill 1228, offered by Republican Bob Ballinger of Carroll County. The measure was revised and subsequently passed by a large margin in the House, supported by Johnson and signed into law in revised form, SB 975, by Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson. ==References== Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:University of Central Arkansas alumni Category:University of Arkansas alumni Category:People from Jacksonville, Arkansas Category:American justices of the peace Category:Arkansas Republicans Category:Members of the Arkansas House of Representatives Category:Arkansas Democrats Category:Businesspeople from Arkansas Category:American accountants Category:Baptists from Arkansas Category:21st-century American politicians ","title":"Bob Johnson (Arkansas state representative)"},{"id":"46419336","text":"Edaphaspis bystrowi is an extinct amphiaspidid cyathaspidid heterostracan.Novitskaya, Larisse. Les amphiaspides (Heterostraci) du Devonien de la Siberie. √âditions du Centre national de la recherche scientifique, 1971. Its fossils are restricted to early Devonian-aged marine strata of the Taimyr Peninsula, Early Devonian Siberia. E. bystrowi, as with all other amphiaspidids, is thought to have been a benthic filter feeder that lived on top of, or buried just below the surface of the substrate of hypersaline lagoon-bottoms. It is the only representative of the family Edaphaspididae. ==Anatomy== E. bystrowi is known from a mostly complete cephalothoracic armor that is 16 centimeters long, and 21 centimeters wide. The armor is laterally flanked on both sides by serrated fringes. The anterior portion of the armor is missing, so experts are unsure if E. bystrowi had eyes (and preorbital openings) or not. There is a pair of branchial openings placed dorsally on a large dorsal lump at the posterior end of the armor. ==References== Category:Amphiaspidida Category:Devonian jawless fish Category:Early Devonian fish Category:Cyathaspidiformes genera Category:Devonian fish of Asia Category:Fauna of Siberia Category:Fossils of Russia Category:Early Devonian first appearances Category:Devonian extinctions ","title":"Edaphaspis"},{"id":"46419344","text":"The 1994 French Supertouring Championship is the twentieth season of the French Supertouring Championship.

His latest book, Sex and Vanity, was released in June 2020. In 2014, Kwan was named as one of the \\"Five Writers to Watch\\" on the list of Hollywood's Most Powerful Authors published by The Hollywood Reporter. In 2018, Kwan made Time magazine's list of 100 most influential people and was inducted into The Asian Hall of Fame, a project of the Robert Chinn Foundation established in 2004. ==Early life== Kevin Kwan was born in Singapore as the youngest of three boys, into an established Chinese Singaporean family. His great-grandfather, Oh Sian Guan, was a founding director of Singapore's oldest bank, the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation. His paternal grandfather, Sir Arthur Kwan Pah Chien M.D., was an ophthalmologist who became Singapore's first Western-trained specialist and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his philanthropic efforts. His maternal grandfather, the Rev. Paul Hang Sing Hon, founded the Hinghwa Methodist Church. Kwan is also related to Hong Kong-born American actress Nancy Kwan and former Singaporean finance minister Richard Hu, who was a cousin of his father. While in Singapore, Kwan studied at the Anglo-Chinese School and lived with his paternal grandparents. Kwan's father and mother, an engineer and pianist respectively, moved the family to the United States when Kwan was 11. The family moved to Clear Lake, Texas, and Kwan attended Clear Lake High School, graduating when he was 16. He attended the University of Houston-Clear Lake, where he earned a BA in Media Studies, after which he moved to Manhattan to attend Parsons School of Design in order to pursue a BFA in Photography. In New York, Kwan worked for Andy Warhol's Interview Magazine, Martha Stewart Living, and Tibor Kalman's design firm M&Co.; In 2000, Kwan established his own creative studio, clients of which included Ted.com, Museum of Modern Art, and The New York Times. ==Career== Kwan edited I Was Cuba (featuring photographs collected by Ramiro A. Fern√°ndez, published in 2007) and coauthored the book Luck: The Essential Guide with Deborah Aaronson (published in 2008). Kwan became inspired to write Crazy Rich Asians in 2009 while caring for his father, who was dying of cancer. Kwan and his father would reminisce about their life in Singapore while driving to and from medical appointments, and Kwan began writing stories to capture those memories. Kwan stated one of his goals was to showcase the \\"educated families with style and taste that have been quietly going about their lives for generations\\" which went beyond the typical contemporary coverage of Asia which focused on conspicuous consumption. Friends had been urging him to commit his memories to paper as well. Moving to the United States has westernized his view of Asia, and he likens himself to \\"an outsider looking in\\" when describing his life in Singapore. Crazy Rich Asians Kwan published Crazy Rich Asians in 2013. The book was inspired by his childhood in Singapore; the second chapter more specifically was developed from a poem he had written years before entitled \\"Singapore Bible Study.\\" Kwan wrote the poem, which describes the study group as \\"an excuse to gossip and show off new jewelry\\" for a creative writing course in college. In the process of turning that scene into a chapter of a novel, he was inspired to complete the entire story. The novel was described as \\"a sprawling, multi-generational mock epic that centers on a clan of Singaporeans whose various factions gather from their respective lairs around the globe for a wedding that is the year's most talked-about event among the international Chinese aristocracy.\\" Upon publication, it received positive reviews, became both a national and an international bestseller, and has been translated into twelve languages. In 2013, Hunger Games producer Nina Jacobson secured film rights to Crazy Rich Asians. The film was released in the United States on August 15, 2018. Kwan served as executive producer on the film, one of the conditions to selling the rights. China Rich Girlfriend Kwan published the first sequel to Crazy Rich Asians entitled China Rich Girlfriend in June 2015. Similarly to Crazy Rich Asians, China Rich Girlfriend became an international bestseller. On August 15, 2018, it was reported that even before the release of the film adaptation of his first novel, Kwan had already been tasked with developing a film from the sequel China Rich Girlfriend. (physically published in August 27, 2018 issue; digitally published on August 15) On April 29, 2019, CNBC reported the back-to-back filming of two sequels to Crazy Rich Asians set for filming in 2020. China Rich Girlfriend, as of April 2019, is currently in pre-production. Rich People Problems Kwan's third and final installment of the Crazy Rich trilogy, titled Rich People Problems, was released in May 2017. In August 2018, Amazon Studios ordered a new drama series from Kwan and STX Entertainment. The unnamed series is set in Hong Kong and follows the \\"most influential and powerful family\\" along with their business empire. On April 29, 2019, CNBC reported the back-to-back filming of two sequels to Crazy Rich Asians set for filming in 2020. Rich People Problems, as of April 2019, is currently in pre-production. Sex and Vanity In June 2020, Kwan's novel Sex and Vanity was published to good reviews, and with mention that this novel is not at all like Crazy Rich Asians. The plot has a structure like that of A Room with A View by E. M. Forster, and major characters have similar names. ==Singapore Ministry of Defence allegations== On 22 August 2018, Singapore's Ministry of Defence stated that Kwan is wanted in Singapore for defaulting on National Service obligation. The Ministry of Defence stated that Kwan had failed to register for National Service in 1990 and did not have a valid exit permit to remain overseas, even though he has been living outside of Singapore since he was 11 years old. In 1994, his application and subsequent appeal to renounce his Singapore citizenship without serving National Service were rejected. Kwan is liable to a fine of up to $10,000 under the Enlistment Act. ==References * Official Website * Category:21st-century American novelists Category:21st-century American male writers Category:American novelists of Asian descent Category:American writers of Chinese descent Category:Living people Category:Singaporean emigrants to the United States Category:Singaporean people of Chinese descent Category:Singaporean people of Henghua descent Category:Singaporean people of Cantonese descent Category:University of Houston alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Kevin Kwan"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function F(s,a,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâLife Quotesü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",R,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const I=d(P,[["render",F]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/41.md","filePath":"quotes/41.md"}'),H={name:"quotes/41.md"},N=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(a,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(I)]))}});export{D as __pageData,N as default};
