A radio adaptation, broadcast April 26, 1951, on NBC's Screen Directors Playhouse, received much press coverage because Stewart's co-star was Margaret Truman, making her debut as a radio actress for a fee of $2,500. She received mixed reviews, and noted that her father \\"enjoyed it\\".Lewiston Evening Journal, April 27, 1951. ==Characters and story== Bill Lawrence (Stewart), employed at a midwest department store, supports a wife (Hale) and two teenage kids (Wood, Tommy Rettig) on an annual salary of $7,500. Answering a phone call, he wins $24,000 worth of merchandise from a radio quiz program and is overwhelmed by prizes which range from the useful to the absurd, including a side of beef, 7,500 cans of soup, 1,000 fruit trees, a Palomino pony, a portable swimming pool, a diamond ring, a French maid, an interior decorator (Alan Mowbray) and portrait painter Hilda Jones (Patricia Medina). All is well until Lawrence is told he must sell the prizes in order to pay an income tax of $7000. When he tries to raise the money by selling the merchandise at the department store, his boss (Fred Clark) fires him. When he tries to fence the diamond ring in Chicago, he's arrested. Complicating matters, his wife suspects him of having an affair with Greenwich Village artist Hilda. Dealing with these problems, he gets help from reporter Harry Summers (James Gleason), who had been writing newspaper articles about Lawrence and his winnings. Bandleader Harry James made an uncredited appearance as a radio vocalist. ==Cast== * James Stewart as William J.

Nikah means marriage and halala means to make something halal, or permissible. This form of marriage is haram (forbidden) according to the hadith of Islamic prophet Muhammad. Nikah halala is practiced by a small minority of Muslims, mainly in countries that recognise the triple talaq. ==Islamic law== In classical Islamic law, a husband may divorce by simply announcing to his wife that he repudiates her (talaq). The initial declaration of talaq is a revocable repudiation (·π≠alƒÅq raj øah) which does not terminate the marriage. The husband can revoke the divorce at any time during the waiting period (‚Äòiddah) which lasts three full menstrual cycles. Resumption of sexual relations automatically retracts the repudiation. The divorce becomes final when the waiting period expires. This is called a \\"minor\\" divorce (al- baynuna al-sughra) and the couple can remarry. If the husband repudiates his wife for the third time, it triggers a \\"major\\" divorce (al-baynuna al-kubra), after which the couple cannot remarry without an intervening consummated marriage by the wife to another man. This is known as tahlil or nikah halala. Making the third pronouncement irrevocable acts as a deterrent to rash repudiations. It is not permissible to marry a woman if one's objective is to make her permissible for her first husband per classical Islamic law.https://islamqa.info/en/109245 There are hadith from that confirm that entering a tahleel marriage with the intention of divorcing so that the original spouses can be remarry is forbidden (haraam). Abu Dawood and Ibn Majah reported that both the first husband (muhallil) and the temporary husband (muhallil lahu) were cursed by God, and Ibn Majah calls the temporary husband \\"a borrowed billy-goat\\". Al-Hakim Nishapuri adds that marriage should be based on genuine intentions, and that in the time of Muhammad, tahleel spouses would have been consideded adulterers. ==UK== A BBC report found that halala is practised in certain Pakistani Muslim communities in the UK. The report uncovered many instances where women were socially and sexually exploited by local religious figures. == India == Petitions have been filed by many Muslim women in Indian Supreme Court against nikah halala. In March 2018, the Supreme Court issued notice to the Indian government on the issue of nikah halala and polygamy. The BJP-ruled government is in favor of criminalizing nikah halala as the government believes that the practice is against the principles of gender justice, and made its stand clear in the apex court on the issue. Muslim women's rights organizations have welcomed the attitude of the Government and stated that these initiatives should have been taken much earlier. The Supreme Court of India will hear the petition against nikah halala and polygamy in Muslim communities from July 20, 2018. On Sept 13, 2018, a Muslim woman named Shabnam Rani was attacked with acid. She was one of the petitioners against the practice of nikah halala. Islamic radicals are the main suspects. On Sept 18, 2018 the Supreme Court asked the government to provide adequate security to the lady. == See also == * Nikah mut'ah * Nikah Halala (1971 film) * Islamic view of marriage *Nikah Misyar *Muslim Personal Law In India ==References== Category:Marriage in Islam Category:Islamic terminology ","title":"Nikah halala"},{"id":"2229549","text":"Missouri Route 740, better known as Stadium Boulevard, is a short highway located completely within the city of Columbia, Missouri, United States.

The series was produced by Belvision Studios and first aired in 1957. After two books were adapted in black and white, eight books were then adapted in colour, each serialised into a set of five- minute episodes, with 103 episodes produced (twelve in black and white and ninety-one in colour). ==Changes from the books== Most stories in the television series varied widely from the original books, often changing whole plots. In Black Island, Captain Haddock plays a leading role, while he was absent in the original comic book. Professor Calculus makes a cameo. Puschov accuses Tintin of robbing him, but in an airport. Tintin and Haddock hide in post office bags to get to Sussex, but Haddock gets in the wrong bag, and they are separated. Tintin later finds Haddock in England examining the plane. Dr. M√ºller is older and white-haired, and has a goatee. Ranko doesn't break his arm in this version, and even aids Tintin, Haddock and Snowy. This is the only story in the entire series that also exists in a black-and-white form, in animation mode. In The Crab with the Golden Claws, Tintin sees Herbert Dawes being drowned and decides to investigate. In this version, Tintin and Haddock already know each other, whilst in the original book, it is their first meeting. Haddock is drugged with narcotics, rather than whiskey. Instead of opium, diamonds are smuggled in the tins. The main characters have slightly different exploits in the desert. They are attacked by a desert raider named Ahmed the Terrible, and later by the pilot of the seaplane. The ending has also been re-written. In Star of Mystery (The Shooting Star), Professor Phostle is replaced with Professor Calculus. In line with this change, the phostlite is renamed \\"calculite\\". Professor Philippulus is Calculus' assistant, and he predicts the end of the world, but his predictions are wrong. Calculus accompanies Tintin on the meteorite, and the Peary captain and a crewman chase Tintin and Calculus on the meteorite, but are chased off by the giant spider. Captain Chester has been removed from the storyline, and Thomson and Thompson accompany them on the voyage, whereas in the book they only appeared in one panel. In The Secret of the Unicorn, Barnaby and Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine are completely missing from the storyline. Marlinspike Hall has been renamed \\"Hudson Manor\\". Max Bird escapes in his car, but in this version, he is pursued by Tintin, Haddock, and Thomson and Thompson. They fight him on a pumpkin farmer's truck and pursue him with help from a pilot. Aristides Silk (the pickpocket) has been renamed \\"Herbert Knill\\". In Red Rackham's Treasure, they already know Calculus, who is not hard of hearing. Max Bird follows them, and attacks Tintin underwater and is nearly killed by an octopus. Haddock is the one who meets a shark underwater instead of Tintin. There are natives on the desert island, who bear a strong resemblance to the Arumbayas from The Broken Ear. Thomson and Thompson are saved from losing their heads when Haddock pretends he is the Idol of Sir Francis Haddock speaking, similar to The Broken Ear. The group is captured by natives, but escape when a volcanic eruption sinks the Island (similar to Flight 714 to Sydney). Max Bird meets them at the Marlinspike Hall after they find the treasure, but they overpower him. In Objective Moon (Destination Moon & Explorers on the Moon), the trip to the moon was all about rescuing Snowy, who was trapped in the (now white) test rocket. Captain Haddock's whiskey is replaced with coffee, and when he is pulled into orbit, he is not drunk, but his feet are hurting, so he takes his metal boots off. The tank is replaced with a hovering car called \\"the moon mobile\\". Professor Calculus, Haddock, and Thomson and Thompson explore the dark side of the moon in it but get trapped by a cave-in caused by a meteor shower. Snowy rescues them by giving them dynamite. Colonel Jorgen and Frank Wolff survive, and at the end, the rocket crashes in the mountains. The Calculus Case (The Calculus Affair) was the most altered series, the changes amounting to a completely different story altogether. Jolyon Wagg was entirely removed, and Calculus' ultrasound weapon is called \\"Silly the Silent\\" (or \\"No-Sound Nellie\\" in the US English version). Thomson and Thompson's roles have been expanded, and Haddock is captured with Calculus in \\"Darkol Prison\\". Alfredo Topolino and Colonel Sponsz have been renamed \\"Professor Bretzel\\" and \\"Colonel Brutel\\". More generally, Tintin's home is located in New York, Captain Haddock does not have a penchant for whiskey (and prefers drinking coffee instead), Professor Calculus does not have hearing problems, Thomson and Thompson are brothers and their moustaches are identical, and Snowy has a red collar. The first episode, Objective Moon, makes reference to other earlier stories through Tintin reminiscing. It mentions Tintin in the Congo, The Crab with the Golden Claws and The Red Sea Sharks. ==Broadcasts and releases== *The series was produced by Raymond Leblanc, who launched Belvision as well as Tintin magazine. * The first two seasons were in black and white, with minimal animation, and they were released in both French and English.

SR 28 has been part of the Nevada scenic byway system since June 1994 and the National Scenic Byway system since September 1996. ==Route description== View northward from the south end of SR 28 in northwestern Douglas County, October 2015 SR 28 begins at Spooner Junction, a T intersection with US 50 (also known as the Lincoln Highway) and SR 28 on the border between the Humboldt‚ÄìToiyabe National Forest and the Lake Tahoe ‚Äì Nevada State Park in northwestern Douglas County, just south of Spooner Lake. (US 50 heads west toward Zephyr Cove, South Lake Tahoe, California and eventually Sacramento and east toward Carson City and Fallon.) From its southern terminus SR 28 heads northwest, initially along the border between the national forest and the state park. After about the highway leaves Douglas County and enters Carson City (independent city) and fully enters the state park.

The purpose of the holiday is to give thanks to the ocean's bounty and to consider the importance of the ocean to Japan as an island nation. Many people take advantage of the holiday and summer weather to take a beach trip. Other ocean-related festivities are observed as well. The date roughly coincides with the end of the rainy season (Ê¢ÖÈõ® tsuyu) in much of the Japan mainland. In 2020, the holiday was observed on Thursday, July 23, a one-time move that was made as a special accommodation to support the opening of the Tokyo Olympics.

Communications Minister Shozo Murata designated the day in 1941 to commemorate the Meiji Emperor and his 1876 voyage in the Meiji Maru, an iron steamship constructed in Scotland in 1874. The voyage included a trip around the T≈çhoku region, embarking on a lighthouse boat in Aomori, and a brief stop in Hakodate before returning to Yokohama on July 20 of that year. However, it was not designated a national holiday until 1995, when it became the first holiday in the summer months. First observed on July 20, 1996, the Happy Monday System legislation moved the date to the third Monday of July beginning in 2003. As special arrangement for the 2020 Summer Olympics, the 2020 date for Marine Day was moved to July 23. With the Olympics and Paralympics postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government left this change in place for 2020 and passed an amendment to the Olympic and Paralympic Special Measures Act to make a corresponding change to the holiday in 2021. == Celebration == On this day, families may visit the sea and swim, snorkel, surf, or dive. People may also participate in an event called ‚Äòmud-ball throwing‚Äô. Mud-balls are composed of \\"Effective Micro-organisms\\" (EMs), which help break-down and eliminate sea grime.

Weak van der Waals forces hold these molecules together in a hexagonal lattice (However, in spite of the high symmetry of the molecules, the crystal packing is not a close packing). The structure of the P4O10 cage is reminiscent of adamantane with Td symmetry point group.D. E. C. Corbridge \\"Phosphorus: An Outline of its Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Technology\\" 5th Edition Elsevier: Amsterdam. . It is closely related to the corresponding anhydride of phosphorous acid, P4O6. The latter lacks terminal oxo groups. Its density is 2.30 g/cm3. It boils at 423 ¬∞C under atmospheric pressure; if heated more rapidly it can sublimate. This form can be made by condensing the vapor of phosphorus pentoxide rapidly, the result is an extremely hygroscopic solid.. The other polymorphs are polymeric, but in each case the phosphorus atoms are bound by a tetrahedron of oxygen atoms, one of which forms a terminal P=O bond involving the donation of the terminal oxygen p-orbital electrons to the antibonding phosphorus-oxygen single bonds. The macromolecular form can be made by heating the compound in a sealed tube for several hours, and maintaining the melt at a high temperature before cooling the melt to the solid. The metastable orthorhombic, \\"O\\"-form (density 2.72 g/cm3, melting point 562 ¬∞C), adopts a layered structure consisting of interconnected P6O6 rings, not unlike the structure adopted by certain polysilicates. The stable form is a higher density phase, also orthorhombic, the so-called O' form. It consists of a 3-dimensional framework, density 3.5 g/cm3. The remaining polymorph is a glass or amorphous form; it can be made by fusing any of the others. {align=\\"center\\"   300px250px -  part of an o‚Ä≤-(P2O5)‚àû layero‚Ä≤-(P2O5)‚àû layers stacking } ==Preparation== P4O10 is prepared by burning tetraphosphorus with sufficient supply of oxygen: : P4 \\\\+ 5 O2 ‚Üí P4O10 For most of the 20th century, phosphorus pentoxide was used to provide a supply of concentrated pure phosphoric acid. In the thermal process, the phosphorus pentoxide obtained by burning white phosphorus was dissolved in dilute phosphoric acid to produce concentrated acid.Threlfall, Richard E., (1951). The story of 100 years of Phosphorus Making: 1851 - 1951. Oldbury: Albright & Wilson Ltd Improvements in filter technology is leading to the \\"wet phosphoric acid process\\" taking over from the thermal process, obviating the need to produce white phosphorus as a starting material.Podger, Hugh (2002). Albright & Wilson: The Last 50 Years. Studley: Brewin Books. The dehydration of phosphoric acid to give phosphorus pentoxide is not possible as on heating metaphosphoric acid will boil without losing all its water. ==Applications== Phosphorus pentoxide is a potent dehydrating agent as indicated by the exothermic nature of its hydrolysis: :P4O10 \\\\+ 6 H2O ‚Üí 4 H3PO4 (‚Äì177 kJ) However, its utility for drying is limited somewhat by its tendency to form a protective viscous coating that inhibits further dehydration by unspent material. A granular form of P4O10 is used in desiccators. Consistent with its strong desiccating power, P4O10 is used in organic synthesis for dehydration. The most important application is for the conversion of primary amides into nitriles:Meier, M. S. \\"Phosphorus(V) Oxide\\" in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis (Ed: L. Paquette) 2004, J. Wiley & Sons, New York. . :P4O10 \\\\+ RC(O)NH2 ‚Üí P4O9(OH)2 \\\\+ RCN The indicated coproduct P4O9(OH)2 is an idealized formula for undefined products resulting from the hydration of P4O10. Alternatively, when combined with a carboxylic acid, the result is the corresponding anhydride: :P4O10 \\\\+ RCO2H ‚Üí P4O9(OH)2 \\\\+ [RC(O)]2O The \\"Onodera reagent\\", a solution of P4O10 in DMSO, is employed for the oxidation of alcohols.Tidwell, T. T. \\"Dimethyl Sulfoxide‚ÄìPhosphorus Pentoxide\\" in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis (Ed: L. Paquette) 2004, J. Wiley & Sons, New York. . This reaction is reminiscent of the Swern oxidation. The desiccating power of P4O10 is strong enough to convert many mineral acids to their anhydrides. Examples: HNO3 is converted to N2O5; H2SO4 is converted to SO3; HClO4 is converted to Cl2O7; CF3SO3H is converted to (CF3)2S2O5. ==Related phosphorus oxides== Between the commercially important P4O6 and P4O10, phosphorus oxides are known with intermediate structures.Luer, B.; Jansen, M. \\"Crystal Structure Refinement of Tetraphosphorus Nonaoxide, P4O9\\" Zeitschrift fur Kristallographie 1991, volume 197, pages 247-8. Phosphorus oxides: P4O6, P4O7, P4O8, P4O9, and P4O10. ==Hazards== Phosphorus pentoxide itself is not flammable. Just like sulfur trioxide, it reacts vigorously with water and water-containing substances like wood or cotton, liberates much heat and may even cause fire due to the highly exothermic nature of such reactions. It is corrosive to metal and is very irritating ‚Äì it may cause severe burns to the eye, skin, mucous membrane, and respiratory tract even at concentrations as low as 1 mg/m3.Phosphorus pentoxide MSDS ==See also== *Eaton's reagent ==References Category:Inorganic phosphorus compounds Category:Acid anhydrides Category:Acidic oxides Category:Glass compositions Category:Dehydrating agents Category:Adamantane-like molecules Category:Phosphorus‚Äìoxygen compounds Category:Phosphorus(+5) compounds Category:Deliquescent substances ","title":"Phosphorus pentoxide"},{"id":"2229681","text":"Disturbing the Peace is the second studio album by the American heavy metal band Alcatrazz, and is the only one featuring Steve Vai on guitar.

He was survived by his wife, now deceased, a son, Michael Samachson, and a daughter, the photographer Miriam Berkley. ==CareerBiochemist=== A graduate of Rutgers University, he earned a Ph.D. in chemistry from Yale at the age of 23. He was an assistant professor at the College of Medicine, University of Illinois. He also headed a laboratory in metabolic research at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Hines, Illinois, a research unit dealing with diseases that affect the skeleton. Comics historian Jerry Bails wrote that Samachson worked as a research chemist for the American Molasses Company until 1938, leaving to become a \\"freelance technical writer\\". ===Author=== As a writer, Samachson translated a number of scientific papers, and in addition to his scientific work, earned a well- deserved reputation as an author, writing books for young people such as Mel Oliver and Space Rover on Mars, which was also published in a Dutch translation. Science fiction and pulps Samachson's novella \\"The Dragon Army\\", written under his \\"William Morrison\\" byline, was the cover story in the November 1952 issue of Fantastic Adventures He wrote a number of science fiction works (under the pseudonym William Morrison), including two novels published in Startling Stories, the 1937 pulp title Murder of a Professor and short stories for a number of magazines, including Money from Heaven (1942). He also penned a couple of Captain Future pulp novels c.1941‚Äì1942 (under the house name \\"Brett Sterling\\"), and had work appear in the science fiction magazine Galaxy. His young adult novel Mel Oliver and Space Rover on Mars was published by Gnome Press in 1954. Comics He is believed to have begun working for DC Comics in late 1942, working on comics scripts for characters notably including Batman. He also wrote scripts for comics and characters including Sandman, Green Arrow, Airwave and Robotman, as well as \\"a string of 17 science-fiction stories in 1955 and 1956\\".Who's Who in American Comic Books: Joe Samachson. Accessed May 8, 2008 In 1955, he created (with artist Joe Certa) the Martian Manhunter in the pages of Detective Comics #225. Usually credited as author on the initial strip, some commentators believe that he may have produced the plot, but that writer Jack Miller (who most believe succeeded Samachson in writing the character with the next issue), may have produced the first script.\\"The Captain's Unofficial Justice League Homepage\\": Martian Manhunter. Accessed May 8, 2008 Don Markstein's Toonopedia also suggests that Samachson wrote \\"many subsequent\\" appearances of J'Onn J'Onzz rather than just the first.Toonopedia: J'onn J'onzz, Manhunter from Mars . Accessed May 8, 2008 Jerry Bails also lists Samachson as having co- created the historical DC character Tomahawk. In 1943 Samachson also created the character Two-Gun Percy, which first appeared under the DC Comics imprint All Funny Comics and was drawn by Bernard Baily. In 1975, DC Comics adapted an unused story he wrote in the 1940s featuring the Seven Soldiers of Victory into a six-part serial in Adventure Comics #438-443. Television Samachson also wrote scripts for Captain Video and His Video Rangers.Samachson obituary, p. 61 of the June 5, 1980 Trenton Evening Times ===Other work=== With his wife Dorothy Samachson, he wrote about theater (\\"Let's Meet the Theatre\\" and \\"The Dramatic Story of the Theatre\\"), music (\\"Masters of Music\\" and The Fabulous World of Opera), ballet, archeology (Good Digging) and a number of other titles, including Rome, a Rand McNally \\"Cities of the World\\" title.

(1954), The Theory of Public Expenditure, in: Review of Economics and Statistics 36, pp. 386-389. in the theory of public goods in economics, is a condition for the efficient provision of public goods. When satisfied, the Samuelson condition implies that further substituting public for private goods (or vice versa) would result in a decrease of social utility. For an economy with n consumers the conditions reads as follows: : \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\text{MRS}_i = \\\\text{MRT} MRSi is individual i marginal rate of substitution and MRT is the economy's marginal rate of transformation between the public good and an arbitrarily chosen private good. If the private good is a numeraire good then the Samuelson condition can be re-written as: : \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\text{MB}_i = \\\\text{MC} where \\\\text{MB}_i is the marginal benefit to each person of consuming one more unit of the public good, and MC is the marginal cost of providing that good. In other words, the public good should be provided as long as the overall benefits to consumers from that good are at least as great as the cost of providing it. (Remember that public goods are non-rival, so can be enjoyed by many consumers simultaneously). Supply and demand interpretation of Samuelson condition When written this way, the Samuelson condition has a simple graphic interpretation. Each individual consumer's marginal benefit, \\\\text{MB}_i , represents his or her demand for the public good, or willingness to pay. The sum of the marginal benefits represent the aggregate willingness to pay or aggregate demand. The marginal cost is, under competitive market conditions, the supply for public goods. Hence the Samuelson condition can be thought of as a generalization of supply and demand concepts from private to public goods. ==See also== *Lindahl equilibrium ==References== *Br√ºmmerhoff, Dieter (2001), Finanzwissenschaft, M√ºnchen u.a.O.

There were plans to eventually reconnect the route to US 65\\\\. ==Route description== Route 465 began at an interchange with Route 76 northwest of Branson in Stone County. A stub of the freeway with ghost ramps continues a short distance south of the interchange. From the junction with Route 76, the four-lane freeway headed north through wooded hilly areas, curving to the northeast. The median widened and the road entered Taney County before heading to the north again. The route turned to the east, the median narrowing before an interchange with Route 248. Past this interchange, the highway continued east through more rural areas. The freeway ended as the road came to an at-grade intersection with Adair Road. Route 465 went east as a four-lane undivided road for a short distance before ending at an interchange with US 65, where Route 76 now leaves the Highroad to run concurrently along US 65 to downtown Branson. The road continues past US 65 as Route F. ==History== In order for the city of Branson to obtain the \\"strip\\" of Branson between Route 376 and US 65, Route 76 was routed on to the Highroad and US 65 between the Highroad and 76 Country Boulevard.

After attending Primary and High School in Kelantan and Penang respectively, he furthered his education at Plymouth College and Leeds University, England. His multi-cultural academic and social background has resulted in Seng Giaw being fluent in Mandarin, English, Bahasa Malaysia, and competent in the writing of Malay in the Jawi script. Seng Giaw's academic qualifications include a M.B.Ch. B. (Leeds), D. Obs. R.C.O.G, M.R.C.P (UK) and finally a M.D. honours (Leeds) in 1976. An active participant in student activities, he represented the Leeds Medical School on the British Medical Student's Association for five years, and was a founding member of the Chinese Society of the University of Leeds, where he held the office of Society President during 1965‚Äì66. His social activities include the office of Pengerusi Kehormat of Persatuan Murid-murid Tua, Chung Ling for the states of Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang and Kuala Lumpur. Over the years, Tan has gathered a wide portfolio of medical experience, having worked at various hospitals (both international and local), private practice clinics and a short period in the Royal Malaysian Army. Tan is working as a Specialist Dermatologist at the Chinese Maternity Hospital Medical Centre. In 1972, Tan married Oon Hong Geok, a paediatrician and has two daughters. His wife used to be active in the political scene and represented Taman Aman, Petaling Jaya as a state assemblywoman. ==Political career== Tan's political involvement began in 1976, during which he served the people of Kepong on behalf of Dr. Tan Chee Khoon. He was the Democratic Action Party's National Vice-chairman and Member of Parliament for the constituency of Kepong leading up to the 2018 general election (GE14). Despite having been successful elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) of Kepong for eight consecutive terms (from 1982-2018), Tan was dropped as a candidate of choice for the party in GE14. This was amid the rumours nearing the GE14, and Tan's action who went on the offensive by declaring 'he will not back down' and began releasing a series of press statements including a veiled attack on DAP party leaders through an interview with Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA)'s controlled newspaper, The Star as well as UMNO controlled, New Straits Times which labeled them as 'not as honest as the late Tan Chee Koon'. ==Election results== {  style=\\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\\" + Selangor State Legislative Assembly Percentage figures based on total turnout. !Year !Constituency !colspan=2 !Votes !Pct !colspan=2Opponent(s) !Votes !Pct !Ballots cast !Majority !Turnout - 1982 Bandar Kelang    (DAP) align=\\"right\\" 18,075 58.49%    (MCA) align=\\"right\\" 12,830 41.51% 31,351 5,245 81.22% - rowspan=31986 rowspan=3Klang Bandar rowspan=3  rowspan=3 (DAP) rowspan=313,223 rowspan=361.77%    (MCA) align=\\"right\\" 6,942 32.43% rowspan=321,803 rowspan=36,281 rowspan=371.88% -   Yeoh Lai Seng (NASMA) 927 4.33% -   Yeoh Poh San (SDP) 314 1.47% - 1990 Kajang    (DAP) align=\\"right\\" 10,138 61.95%    (MCA) align=\\"right\\" 6,227 38.05% 16,856 3,911 75.99% } {  style=\\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\\" + Parliament of Malaysia !Year !Constituency !colspan=2 !Votes !Pct !colspan=2Opponent(s) !Votes !Pct !Ballots cast !Majority !Turnout - rowspan=31978 rowspan=5 P84 Kepong, Kuala Lumpur rowspan=3  rowspan=3 (PEKEMAS) rowspan=317,827 rowspan=336.95%   Tan Tiong Hong (Gerakan) 20,055 41.57% rowspan=3N/A rowspan=32,228 rowspan=3N/A -   Khoo Sin Geok @ Khoo Sin Tow (DAP) 9,971 20.67% -   Kanda (IND) 390 0.81% - rowspan=21982 rowspan=2  rowspan=2 (DAP) rowspan=229,368 rowspan=250.51%   Kerk Kim Tim @ Kerk Choo Ting (Gerakan) 28,163 48.44% rowspan=259,465 rowspan=21,205 rowspan=276.94% -   Ishak Ibrahim (IND) 613 1.05% - rowspan=21986 rowspan=3 P96 Kepong, Kuala Lumpur rowspan=2  rowspan=2 (DAP) rowspan=233,049 rowspan=264.81%   Lum Weng Keong (Gerakan) 16,536 32.43% rowspan=251,476 rowspan=216,513 rowspan=271.73% -   Wong Kim Lin (NASMA) 1,405 2.76% -  1990    (DAP) 38,323 70.58%   Lim Kim Hoe (Gerakan) 15,971 29.42% 54,679 22,352 71.23% - 1995 rowspan=3 P103 Kepong, Kuala Lumpur    (DAP) 25,075 55.56%   Tan Poh Eng (Gerakan) 20,053 44.44% 45,454 5,022 75.62% - rowspan=21999 rowspan=2  rowspan=2 (DAP) rowspan=225,085 rowspan=250.77%   Ma Woei Chyi (Gerakan) 23,319 47.20% rowspan=249,730 rowspan=21,766 rowspan=276.55% -   Mano (IND) 1,003 2.03% - 2004 rowspan=4 P114 Kepong, Kuala Lumpur    (DAP) 23,282 52.07%   Ma Woei Chyi (Gerakan) 21,428 47.93% 44,956 1,854 74.59% - 2008    (DAP) 35,552 75.23%   Lau Hoi Keong (Gerakan) 11,704 24.77% 47,508 23,848 78.17% - rowspan=22013 rowspan=2  rowspan=2 (DAP) rowspan=247,837 rowspan=282.30%   Chandrakumanan Arumugam (PPP) 7,530 12.96% rowspan=258,585 rowspan=240,307 rowspan=286.11% -   Yee Poh Ping (IND) 2,757 4.74% } ==References *Tan Seng Giaw's blog *Tan Seng Giaw's Parliamentary Profile Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:People from Kota Bharu Category:People from Kelantan Category:Malaysian people of Chinese descent Category:Malaysian politicians of Chinese descent Category:Malaysian dermatologists Category:Malaysian military personnel Category:Democratic Action Party (Malaysia) politicians Category:Members of the Dewan Rakyat Category:Members of the Selangor State Legislative Assembly Category:People educated at Plymouth College Category:Alumni of the University of Leeds Category:21st- century Malaysian politicians ","title":"Tan Seng Giaw"},{"id":"2229719","text":"Stevie Reeves (born May 16, 1967) is an American professional stock car racing driver and spotter. ==Driving career== After several seasons racing on the bullrings (short tracks) of Indiana, Reeves traveled nationally with the United States Automobile Club and wound up winning back-to-back USAC National Midget titles in 1992 for the Wilke Racers and in 1993 for midget car owner Steve Lewis. After collecting those two titles, Reeves ventured into the NASCAR Busch Grand National Series in 1994 joining Mark Thomas Racing with Clabber Girl sponsorship on the number 96 Chevrolet. In 1995, Reeves collected his first pole at Bristol Motor Speedway and got his first top 10 with a sixth-place finish at Richmond International Raceway. His career best finish in the final points standings for the Busch Series was in 1997 when he took 20th place. Ultimately his career in the Busch Series was for the most part underwhelming. He never could hold a steady ride in his NASCAR career, which lasted from 1994 to 1998. Reeves was employed by five different car owners in his five seasons (Mark Thomas, Ed Whitaker, Mike Curb, Donald Laird, and David Ridling). After his stint in Busch, Reeves returned to his roots in open-wheel racing in 1998. Reeves made his first start in the Indy Racing League at the Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina on July 25 of that year, finishing an impressive 10th for Pagan Racing. He drove three more IRL races in 2000 for Logan Racing, suffering mechanical failures in each event. Reeves returned to the USAC Silver Crown Series in 1998, wheeling the Johnny Vance/Raybestos No. 28 Beast. ==Spotting== In 2005, he was employed with Dale Earnhardt, Inc. in NASCAR spotting for Paul Menard in the Busch series. He also drove in the USAC Silver Crown Series. Reeves was the spotter for Dale Earnhardt Jr. in the 2004 Daytona 500, Earnhardt's first win in the event. Reeves moved Hendrick Motorsports in 2007 as the spotter of Jimmie Johnson's No. 48 team, replacing Earl Barban. With Reeves, Johnson won 16 races and the 2007 and 2008 championships, but Reeves was laid off after the 2008 season. After working as a spotter for JTG Daugherty Racing's No. 47 car of Ryan Preece, Reeves joined Christopher Bell's No. 95 Leavine Family Racing team in 2020. ==Racing recordAmerican Open Wheel=== (key) ===NASCAR=== (key) (Bold ‚Äì Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

Peter Ladefoged transcribes it with the IPA symbol that is normally associated with the retroflex flap, . Although the tongue starts out in a subapical retroflex position, trilling involves the tip of the tongue and causes it to move forward to the alveolar ridge. Thus, the retroflex trill gives a preceding vowel retroflex coloration, like other retroflex consonants, but the vibration itself is not much different from an alveolar trill. Thus, the narrower transcription is also appropriate. Wahgi has a similar trilled allophone of its lateral flap, , but it is voiceless. Wintu and Lardil are other languages with a reported (apico-)retroflex trill where the tongue apex \\"approaches\\" the hard palate, but it is not subapical, unlike in Toda.

He served as Ambassador to the Soviet Union between 1942 and 1946 and to the United States between 1946 and 1948. ==Background== An Australian- born Scot, Clark Kerr was born Archibald John Kerr Clark, the son of John Kerr Clark (1838‚Äì1910), originally from Lanarkshire, Scotland, and Kate Louisa (1846‚Äì1926), daughter of Sir John Struan Robertson, five times Premier of the Colony of New South Wales. His family emigrated to England in 1889. In 1911 he assumed the surname of Kerr in addition to that of Clark.thepeerage.com John [sic] Kerr Clark Kerr, 1st and last Baron Inverchapel He attended Bath College from 1892 to 1900.Donald Gillies, Radical Diplomat: The Life of Archibald Clark Kerr, Lord Inverchapel, 1882‚Äì1951 (London & New York: I. B. Tauris, 1999), 6-8. ==Diplomatic career== Clark Kerr entered the Foreign Service in 1906. Early on, he made the mistake of challenging the Foreign Office over its Egyptian policy. Consequently, he found himself posted to a series of capitals in Latin America. He was Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to various Central American republics between 1925 and 1928, to Chile between 1928 and 1930, to Sweden between 1931 and 1934 and to Iraq between 1935 and 1938. He distinguished himself enough in these posts to secure a prestigious appointment as Ambassador to China between 1938 and 1942 during the Japanese occupation. In the ensuing years, he developed a close relationship with Nationalist Chinese leader Chiang Kai-Shek and spent most of his posting explaining why Britain could not offer him any substantive aid in his struggle against the Japanese invaders. He argued for British aid to China based upon humanitarian concerns, the preservation of British economic influence, and the principle of national self-determination. Despite the lack of aid from Britain, he impressed the Chinese with his interest in Confucian philosophy. He also impressed the Chinese with his determination. After the British consulate in Chungking was almost completely destroyed by Japanese bombing in 1940, other diplomatic missions evacuated, but he kept the Union Jack flying close to Chinese government buildings. He regularly swam in the Yangtze River, and after meeting American writer Ernest Hemingway he dismissed him derisively: \\"Tough? Why, I'm tougher than he is!\\"Donald Gillies, Radical Diplomat: The Life of Archibald Clark Kerr, Lord Inverchapel, 1882‚Äì1951 (London & New York: I. B. Tauris, 1999), 111. Kerr shaking hands with George Marshall at the Tehran Conference He was moved to Moscow in February 1942 where he forged a remarkable relationship with Stalin and facilitated a number of Anglo-Soviet diplomatic conferences. His work there and at the Big Three Conferences (such as Yalta and Potsdam) put him at the centre of international politics during the final, pivotal years of the Second World War. Throughout his posting in Moscow he sought clearer direction from the Foreign Office in London. Lacking it, he often fell back upon a directive received from Churchill in February 1943: \\"You want a directive? All right. I don't mind kissing Stalin's bum, but I'm damned if I'll lick his arse!\\"Donald Gillies, Radical Diplomat: The Life of Archibald Clark Kerr, Lord Inverchapel, 1882‚Äì1951 (London & New York: I. B. Tauris, 1999), chapter 7. Quotation from 141. As the war neared its end, Kerr became increasingly concerned about Soviet plans for the post-war world. He did not think that they planned to begin spreading world revolution, but he did think that they were preparing to exert their influence well beyond their pre-war sphere of influence. He voiced deep-seated concerns about Soviet expansionism for the first time in a lengthy memorandum on Soviet policy dated 31 August 1944. In the memo, he forecast three likely results of the war: the removal of any immediate threat to Soviet security, the consolidation of Stalin's dominant position, and the Soviet use of Communist Parties in other countries to serve interests of \\"Russia as a state as distinct from Russia as a revolutionary notion.\\"Donald Gillies, Radical Diplomat: The Life of Archibald Clark Kerr, Lord Inverchapel, 1882‚Äì1951 (London & New York: I. B. Tauris, 1999), 159. This closely resembled the conclusions that George F. Kennan included in a telegram to Washington a few months later. After the war Clerk Kerr was appointed Ambassador to the United States, a post he held until 1948. An acquaintance of Guy Burgess and Donald Duart Maclean's superior in Washington, he took their defection to the USSR badly. The affair cast a shadow over Inverchapel's career.Donald Gillies, Radical Diplomat: The Life of Archibald Clark Kerr, Lord Inverchapel, 1882‚Äì1951 (London & New York: I. B. Tauris, 1999), 226. He died in 1951. Clark Kerr was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 1935 New Year Honours and a Knight Grand Cross in 1942 and was sworn of the Privy Council in 1944. In 1946 he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Inverchapel, of Loch Eck in the County of Argyll. ==Personal life== Lord Inverchapel's personal life has been described as colourful: a close confidant of the Kaiser's sister in the years before the Great War, he was also a disappointed suitor of the Queen Mother before his marriage, divorce, and remarriage, to a Chilean lady 29 years his junior. Politically on the left, a noted wit and unconventional in manner, he was sometimes suspected of excessive understanding for the Soviet position. His biographer, Donald Gillies, considers rumoured pro-Soviet sympathies highly unlikely. Inverchapel is best remembered in the public imagination for a much reproduced note he is said to have written in 1943 to Lord Pembroke while Ambassador to Moscow. A copy of the letter was published in The Spectator in 1978, with the comment that \\"an acquaintance has been delving among the Foreign Office records for the war years\\". \\"My Dear Reggie, In these dark days man tends to look for little shafts of light that spill from Heaven. My days are probably darker than yours, and I need, my God I do, all the light I can get. But I am a decent fellow, and I do not want to be mean and selfish about what little brightness is shed upon me from time to time. So I propose to share with you a tiny flash that has illuminated my sombre life and tell you that God has given me a new Turkish colleague whose card tells me that he is called Mustapha Kunt. We all feel like that, Reggie, now and then, especially when Spring is upon us, but few of us would care to put it on our cards. It takes a Turk to do that. Sir Archibald Clerk Kerr, H.M. Ambassador\\" Lord Inverchapel married a lady belonging to the Chilean aristocracy Do√±a Mar√≠a Teresa D√≠az y Salas, of Santiago, Chile, in 1929, daughter of Don Javier D√≠az y Lira and Do√±a Ventura Salas y Edwards. He died in July 1951, aged 69. The barony died with him as he had no children. ==References== *Donald Gillies, Radical diplomat: the life of Archibald Clark Kerr, Lord Inverchapel, 1882‚Äì1951; I.B.Tauris publishers, London and New York, 1999. *Erik Goldstein, 'Kerr, Archibald John Kerr Clark, Baron Inverchapel (1882‚Äì1951)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, ==External links== * Clark Kerr's letter to Lord Pembroke * Photograph of Clark Kerr at the National Portrait Gallery.

Ensis, or razor clams, are known in much of Scotland as spoots, for the spouts of water they eject while burrowing into the sand, when visible at low tide. This term may also colloquially include members of the genus Solen. Ensis magnus are known as bendies due to their slightly curved shell. ==Description== The shells are long, narrow, and parallel-sided. This shape resembles a closed, old-fashioned straight razor (a cut-throat razor), or a closed jackknife (pocket knife) and sometimes these clams are known as razor shells or jackknives. The shells in these species are fragile and can easily be damaged when digging for these clams. ==Ecology== Ensis species live in clean sand on exposed beaches. They are capable of digging very rapidly; see the description under the Atlantic jackknife clam. Some clammers catch jackknives by pouring salt on the characteristic keyhole- shaped breathing holes. The clam then tries to escape the salt by coming up out of its hole, and at this point it is possible to gently grab the shell and pull it out of the ground. ==Species== Thirteen species are currently recognised: *Ensis californicus (Dall, 1899) *Ensis directus (Conrad, 1843) ‚Äì Atlantic jackknife clam *Ensis ensis (Linnaeus, 1758) *Ensis goreensis (Clessin, 1888) *Ensis macha (Molina, 1782) *Ensis magnus (Schumacher, 1817) *Ensis megistus (Pilsbry & McGinty, 1943) *Ensis minor (Chenu, 1843) *Ensis myrae (Berry, 1954) *Ensis nitidus (Clessin, 1888) *Ensis siliqua (Linnaeus, 1758) ‚Äì pod razor *Ensis terranovensis (Vierna & Mart√≠nez-Lage, 2012) *Ensis tropicalis (Hertlein & Strong, 1955) ==References== Category:Pharidae Category:Bivalve genera ","title":"Ensis"},{"id":"2229760","text":"Love Session is the fourth album by Silk.

He played shortstop, third base and second base during his career in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Colorado Rockies, Chicago White Sox, San Francisco Giants, Los Angeles Dodgers, Atlanta Braves, New York Mets and Cleveland Indians. He bats and throws right-handed. Uribe began his professional career in 1997 when he was signed by the Colorado Rockies. After advancing through the minors, he made his MLB debut with the Rockies in 2001. He became their shortstop in 2001 and spent all of 2002 in that capacity. He missed part of 2003 with an injury and was traded to the Chicago White Sox following the season. After one season as a utility player, Uribe became the starting shortstop for the White Sox in 2005; he held that position for the next three years. While Uribe was with the White Sox, the team won the 2005 World Series against the Houston Astros. Uribe hit 21 home runs in 2006 but had a low on-base percentage. He hit 20 home runs in 2007 but had a low batting average with runners in scoring position (RISP). In 2008, Uribe lost his starting shortstop role to Orlando Cabrera and shifted to the starter at second, but then lost that job to rookie Alexei Ram√≠rez. He eventually ended the season as the team's third baseman due to an injury to Joe Crede. In 2009, Uribe signed with the Giants and was again used as utility player. He spent most of 2010 as the Giants' shortstop, hit a career-high 24 home runs, and had several key hits in the playoffs as the Giants won the 2010 World Series. Following that season, he signed a three-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. The next two years were plagued by injuries and poor hitting, but he regained his starting role at third base and made strong contributions to the team in 2013 and 2014. Uribe was traded to the Braves in late May of the 2015 season and again to the Mets in July of the 2015 season. Before the start of spring training in 2016, he signed a one-year contract with the Cleveland Indians. He was injured by a ground ball on June 12, 2016 and was later diagnosed with a testicular contusion. The Indians designated him for assignment on August 1 and released him on August 5. ==Early life== Uribe was born in Palenque, Dominican Republic. Growing up, he became interested in baseball partly due to Jos√© Uribe. Jos√© was Juan's second cousin, although Juan calls him his \\"uncle\\" because of their age difference. When Major League Baseball (MLB) was not in season, Jos√© would come home to the Dominican Republic and tell Juan about his time in the majors playing shortstop for the San Francisco Giants. Juan proved to have baseball ability too. In 1997, Colorado Rockies scout Jorge Posada, Sr., spotted Uribe while he was scouting pitcher Enemencio Pacheco. Posada offered him a $5,000 contract, but Uribe and his father tried to get a higher amount from agent Bob Michelin. Eventually, Uribe settled for $5,000.Baggarly, p. 232 ==Professional baseball careerMinor league career=== Uribe started his professional career playing in the Dominican Summer League (DSL) for the DSL Rockies. In 1998 and 1999, he played for the rookie-level Arizona Rookie League and the Single-A Asheville Tourists in the South Atlantic League. While in Asheville, he batted .392 with 28 doubles, compiling a 15-game hitting streak at one point in the season. Uribe played for the Single-A advanced Salem Avalanche of the Carolina League in 2000, batting .256 with 13 home runs. Following the season, Baseball America named him the number two prospect in the Rockies' organization. In 2001, he was called up by the Rockies. ===Colorado Rockies=== 2001: Rookie season Uribe played 72 games for the Rockies in his rookie season of 2001. He batted .300, had eight home runs, and had 53 runs batted in (RBIs). He also had 11 triples, tying a club record held by Neifi P√©rez and Juan Pierre. He made his major league debut on April 8, pinch-hitting and striking out against Jay Witasick in an 11‚Äì3 loss to the San Diego Padres. Three days later, he had his first major league hit against Matt Morris in a 3‚Äì1 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals. He was sent down to the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the Pacific Coast League a few times during the season. However, after July 25 he took over the shortstop position for the Rockies when they traded P√©rez. On August 2, he hit his first major league home run against Dave Coggin in a 4‚Äì2 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies. He tied three other franchise records with two hits, two extra base hits, and six total bases in a single inning during an October 7 game against the San Diego Padres. 2002 Uribe played his first full season in the majors for the Rockies in 2002. He started 150 games at shortstop, posting a .240 average, six home runs, 49 RBIs, and 25 doubles. He had a 17-game hitting streak during the months of April and May, a career high. However, his offensive production slumped from May through August, and he also played poor defensive, leading the team with 27 errors. Uribe saw a little improvement offensively late in the season, though, as he tied a career high for hits in a game with four on September 17 in a game against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim; he finished that game a home run short of the cycle. 2003 In 2003, Uribe did not play until June 3 because of an injury suffered when he was rounding the bases during a spring training game on March 1. In his first game back, he homered twice against Ricardo Rodr√≠guez of the Cleveland Indians. He began to play in the outfield for the Rockies, starting at center field on June 15. However, he returned to the shortstop position when Jos√© Hern√°ndez was traded. In 87 games, he batted .253 with 80 hits, 19 doubles, 10 home runs, and 33 RBIs. Uribe was traded to the Chicago White Sox on December 2, 2003, for Aaron Miles. Chicago White Sox in 2008 ===Chicago White Sox=== 2004 Although Uribe did not have a starting role at the beginning of his tenure with the White Sox, he wound up appearing in 134 games for them in 2004, playing second base, shortstop, and third base. On June 19, he had seven RBIs (one short of the White Sox single-game record) in a 17‚Äì14 loss to the Montreal Expos. He set many career highs in batting categories, including batting average with the bases loaded (.556), RISP (.340), batting average (.283), home runs (23), RBIs (74), hits (142), and runs (82). He played much better at home, batting .315 with six home runs compared to .248 with seven home runs on the road. On December 16, he agreed to a contract extension through 2008 with the White Sox. 2005: World Series In 2005, Uribe spent the entire season playing shortstop after the White Sox did not re-sign Jos√© Valent√≠n. In 146 games, a number that would have been higher had it not been for minor injuries, Uribe batted .252 with 121 hits, 23 doubles, 16 home runs, and 74 RBIs. In Game 1 of the American League Division Series (ALDS), Uribe hit a home run and had three RBIs as the White Sox defeated the Boston Red Sox 14‚Äì2. Uribe made two memorable defensive plays for the final two outs of the 2005 World Series, first catching a ball while crashing into the third base stands and then ranging over the middle and firing an off-balance throw on a slow grounder to beat Houston Astro Orlando Palmeiro to give the White Sox their first title in 88 years. 2006 On July 2, 2006, Uribe had five RBIs in a 15‚Äì11 loss to the Chicago Cubs; two days later, he again had five RBIs in a 13‚Äì0 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. Uribe had one of his best power seasons in 2006, batting .235 with 21 home runs and 71 RBIs in 132 games. However, he had the lowest on-base percentage of his career, at .257. (Note: Click bio for non-statistical information) Injuries prevented him from appearing 10 games, and he also lost some starts at shortstop to Alex Cintr√≥n because of his low on-base percentage. He led the White Sox in sacrifice hits and ranked fourth in the AL with a .977 fielding percentage. He also joined Derek Jeter, Miguel Tejada, √âdgar Renter√≠a, and Michael Young as the only shortstops to top 70 RBIs in 2004, 2005, and 2006. 2007 On September 29, 2007, Uribe had a walkoff RBI single against Fernando Rodney to give the White Sox a 3‚Äì2 win over the Detroit Tigers. In 150 games in 2007, Uribe batted .234 with 120 hits, 18 doubles, 20 home runs, and 68 RBIs. He was second in the league in fielding percentage (.976), but he batted .198 with runners in scoring position. The White Sox declined Uribe's option, but on November 7, 2007, they signed him to a one-year, $4.5 million deal. 2008 The White Sox acquired Orlando Cabrera to play shortstop in 2008, forcing Uribe to compete with Alexei Ram√≠rez, Danny Richar, and Pablo Ozuna for the position in spring training. Uribe won the second base job, but after an injury in May, Uribe lost his spot in the White Sox starting lineup to Ram√≠rez. However, Uribe took over third base from Josh Fields (who had spent a week filling in for an injured Joe Crede) on August 1. In 110 games (324 at-bats), Uribe had 80 hits, 22 doubles, seven home runs, and 40 RBIs. On October 30, Uribe filed for free agency. While with the White Sox, Uribe was always regarded as a talented player. He was especially adept at fielding and hitting home runs. However, Ozzie Guill√©n had issues with Uribe's low on-base percentage and his conditioning. ===San Francisco Giants=== 2009 San Francisco Giants in 2009 On January 29, 2009, Uribe signed a minor league deal with the San Francisco Giants. It was announced on April 4 that Uribe had made the Giants final roster as a utility player. Uribe wound up making a lot of starts at second base, shortstop, and third base throughout the season. On July 10, Uribe bobbled a ground ball with one out in the eighth inning of Jonathan S√°nchez's no-hitter against San Diego, allowing Chase Headley to reach first base. The effort had been perfect up to that point, and S√°nchez went on to retire each of the remaining five batters, meaning this error lost the first perfect game since Randy Johnson 's in 2004. This was the first no-hit, no-walk, no‚Äìhit batsman game that was not also a perfect game since Terry Mulholland's no-hitter in 1990. In 122 games (398 at-bats), Uribe batted .289 (his highest average since 2001) with 115 hits, 26 doubles, 16 home runs, and 55 RBIs. 2010: World Series In 2010, Uribe re-signed a one-year, $3.25 million contract with the Giants. He began 2010 as the Giants' second baseman because of an injury to Freddy Sanchez. At the beginning of May, he moved over to shortstop to replace the injured Renter√≠a; for most of the remainder of the season, he was the Giants' starting shortstop. He hit a game-winning two-run home run on September 5 against Jonathan Broxton, turning a 4‚Äì3 deficit into a 5‚Äì4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. On September 23, Uribe hit a grand slam against Ryan Dempster and a two-run home run in the second inning against the Cubs for a total of six RBIs, helping the Giants win 13‚Äì0. He finished the season batting .256 with a career-high 24 home runs and a career-high 85 RBIs. He had 129 hits on the year in 521 at-bats, bringing his career hit total above the 1,000 mark. He had 24 doubles and 2 triples. In Game 4 of the National League Championship Series against the Phillies on October 20, Uribe had a walk-off sacrifice fly against Roy Oswalt in a 6‚Äì5 victory. In Game 6, on October 23, he hit a go-ahead solo home run against Ryan Madson in the top of the eighth, which gave the Giants a 3‚Äì2 victory, sending them to the World Series. In Game 1 of the World Series on October 27, he hit a three-run home run against Darren O'Day which proved decisive in the Giants' 11‚Äì7 victory over the Texas Rangers. He produced an RBI that made it 2‚Äì0 against C. J. Wilson in the seventh inning of Game 2; he added another RBI in the eighth as the Giants won 9‚Äì0. The Giants won the series in five games, and Uribe earned his second World Series championship. ===Los Angeles Dodgers=== 2011 After the 2010 season, Uribe reached an agreement on a three-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. His first season with the Dodgers was one of his worst seasons as he made two trips to the disabled list and only managed to appear in 77 of 162 games, his fewest games since 2001. His production was the weakest of his career, as he hit a subpar .204 with four home runs and 28 RBIs. He was placed on the disabled list on July 30, with what was described as abdominal pain. He was expected to return after 15 days, but the injury didn't get better and was recharacterized as a sports hernia, which needed season-ending surgery. 2012 In the 2012 season, Uribe mostly stayed healthy but his production remained similar to his 2011 totals. From May 14 to June 10, he was on the disabled list with a left wrist injury. After June, he lost his starting role and was relegated to pinch-hitting duties over the second half of the season. He played in just 66 games and hit only .191 (his lowest career total) with two home runs and 17 RBIs. 2013 Uribe began 2013 as a utility player. However, he made frequent starts at third base, and by June, he had taken over the position. On July 5, Uribe had seven RBIs and was a single short of hitting for the cycle in a 10‚Äì2 victory over the Giants. On September 9, 2013, Uribe went four for four and homered in each of his first three trips to the plate against the Arizona Diamondbacks. It was his first 3 home run game in the Major Leagues. He played in 132 games for the Dodgers in 2013, almost as many as his first two seasons with them combined (143). He hit .278 with 12 homers and 50 RBI. On October 7, during Game 4 of the NLDS, Uribe hit a two-run home run in the bottom of the 8th inning to put Los Angeles ahead of the Atlanta Braves 4‚Äì3. The Dodgers held on to defeat the Braves and took the series 3‚Äì1. On December 14, 2013, Uribe agreed to a 2-year, $15 million contract extension with the Dodgers. 2014 Uribe continued his resurgence in 2014, hitting .311 in 103 games. He also had 9 home runs and 54 RBIs. Uribe was well-liked by his teammates, and hailed as a key part of maintaining clubhouse chemistry. Don Mattingly let him manage the Dodgers for the final game of the regular season, a 10‚Äì5 Dodgers win. 2015 Uribe started slowly in 2015 and wound up falling behind both Justin Turner and Alex Guerrero on the depth chart. In 29 games he hit .247 with one homer and six RBIs. ===Atlanta Braves=== On May 27, 2015, Uribe was traded to the Atlanta Braves (with Chris Withrow) in exchange for Alberto Callaspo, Eric Stults, Ian Thomas and Juan Jaime. The trade was finalized during the Braves' three-game series at Dodger Stadium, and Uribe appeared in his new team's uniform in the third game, going 0 for 3 in the Atlanta win. When asked for an opinion on the trade, Uribe commented, \\"I would've felt bad if they traded me to a soccer, basketball or football team. But it's another baseball team, so I'm happy\\". Uribe's popularity as a Dodger extended past his trade, as a scheduled bobblehead night went ahead as planned after he had left the team for the Braves. ===New York Mets=== Uribe on July 25, 2015, one day after trade On July 24, 2015, the Braves traded Uribe and Kelly Johnson to the New York Mets for John Gant and Rob Whalen. During his second game with New York, Uribe hit the walk-off single in the tenth inning to win the game for the Mets, 3‚Äì2 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Uribe missed the National League Division Series and National League Championship Series due to a chest contusion in September, but was added to the Mets' World Series roster and came off the bench in the sixth inning of Game 3 to deliver a pinch-hit single, driving in a run. The Mets would lose the series in 5 games to the Royals. ===Cleveland Indians=== Uribe with the Cleveland Indians in 2016 Just before the start of spring training 2016, Uribe signed a one-year, $4 million deal with the Cleveland Indians. On June 12, 2016 in Anaheim, Uribe had to be carted off the field after being hit in the crotch by a ground ball which came off the bat of Mike Trout at . He was later diagnosed with a testicular contusion. He was designated for assignment on August 1, 2016 and released on August 5. ==Personal life== Uribe and his wife Ana have four children: Juan Luis, Juanny, Janny, and Johanny. He also has a brother named Elpidio. Uribe does not speak particularly good English, so he used a translator throughout his career when conducting interviews. He plays winter baseball in the Dominican Republic every year. He has done work for many different charity organizations. In 2004, he read to children on the Golden Apple Foundation Bus. He also helped with the United States military children's coloring contest. ===2006 shooting allegations=== In October 2006, Uribe was alleged to have been involved in a shooting in his native Dominican Republic. A farmer named Antonio Gonzalez Perez accused Uribe of wounding him with a pellet gun. Despite claims by the San Crist√≥bal Province District Attorney that there was no firm evidence that Uribe was involved in the incident, a judge decided to press forward with the case. Although a defense motion to bar him from leaving the country was rejected, it was ruled on January 5, 2007, that Uribe must appear before a court on the 15 and the 30 of every month until the case was resolved. Uribe, who denied any involvement in the case, suggested that he might not play baseball until the legal proceedings were concluded. He was confident that he would win in court, and the White Sox expected him to be free for spring training. In February, his name was cleared of any involvement with the shooting, and the court ruled he no longer had to appear on the 15 and 30 of every month. Uribe called the incident \\"blackmail\\", saying it was an attempt by Perez to get money from him. ==ReferencesBibliography=== * ==External links== Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Arizona League Rockies players Category:Asheville Tourists players Category:Atlanta Braves players Category:Carolina Mudcats players Category:Charlotte Knights players Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Cleveland Indians players Category:Colorado Rockies players Category:Colorado Springs Sky Sox players Category:Dominican Republic expatriate baseball players in the United States Category:Leones del Escogido players Category:Los Angeles Dodgers players Category:Major League Baseball infielders Category:Major League Baseball players from the Dominican Republic Category:New York Mets players Category:People from Ban√≠ Category:Rancho Cucamonga Quakes players Category:Salem Avalanche players Category:San Francisco Giants players Category:Tulsa Drillers players Category:Visalia Oaks players ","title":"Juan Uribe"},{"id":"2229780","text":"A zig-zag bridge is a pedestrian bridge composed of short segments, each set at an angle relative to its neighbors and usually with an alternating right and left turn required when traveling across the bridge. It is used in standard crossings for structural stability; and in traditional and contemporary Asian and Western landscape design across water gardens. When constructed of wood, each segment is formed from planks and is supported by posts. When constructed of stone, the bridge will use short or long rectilinear slabs set upon stone footings. ==Garden and ceremonial bridge== A zig-zag bridge is often seen in the Chinese garden, Japanese garden, and Zen rock garden. It may be made of stone slabs or planks as part of a pond design and is frequently seen in rustic gardens. It is also used in high art modern fountain gardens, often in public urban park and botanic garden landscapes. The objective in employing such a bridge, constructed according to Zen philosophy and teachings, is to focus the walker's attention to the mindfulness of the current place and time moment - \\"being here, now\\". As it often has no railings, it is quite possible for an inattentive walker to simply fall off an end into the water. The zig-zag of paths and bridges also follows a principle of Chinese Feng Shui. A zig-zag bridge across a marsh, at Boxerwood Gardens in the Shenandoah Valley. A zig-zag bridge across a small pond in Quito at the Jard√≠n Bot√°nico Garden. ==Standard bridge== The post and plank version has an advantage when employed as a crossing of a muddy bottom or marsh: It is structurally stable, where a straight bridge might tend to tip due to the posts moving in the soft mud. Each segment of walkway mutually supports the next from twisting and tipping by being securely fastened to it. This is the same advantage possessed by a zig-zag split rail fence. ==See also== *Step-stone bridge *Moon bridge *Footbridge *S bridge *Chinese garden *Japanese garden ==References *myjapanesegarden: Building a zig-zag garden pond bridge, UK.

It can be used to explore tree-structured search spaces and is often employed in Natural language processing applications, such as parsing of natural languages, or for decoding of error correcting codes where the technique goes under the name of sequential decoding. Stack search keeps a list of the best n candidates seen so far. These candidates are incomplete solutions to the search problems, e.g. partial parse trees. It then iteratively expands the best partial solution, putting all resulting partial solutions onto the stack and then trimming the resulting list of partial solutions to the top n candidates, until a real solution (i.e. complete parse tree) has been found. Stack search is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution to the search problem. The quality of the result depends on the quality of the search heuristic. ==References== Example applications of the stack search algorithm can be found in the literature: * Frederick Jelinek.

At two months of age, she moved with her mother to the United States. She lived with her grandmother in Cleveland, Ohio, and Palm Beach, Florida, for the first four years of her life while her mother attended Columbia University in New York City. When her mother married Douglas McKee, King went to live with them in Forest Hills, Queens. As a teenager, King attended the progressive Edgewood School in Greenwich, Connecticut, a northern campus of Marietta Johnson's Organic School of Education. Playing Juliet in a school production when she was 14, she was asked to audition for a role in a Lee Shubert play, which led to other stage work. ==Career== Andrea King appeared in Broadway plays and other theater work. Her Broadway credits included Fly Away Home (1935) and Growing Pains (1933). She also appeared as Mary Skinner in Life with Father. Her film debut was in a docudrama, The March of Time's first feature-length film titled The Ramparts We Watch (1940). In 1944, she signed with Warner Bros. and changed her stage name to King (some of her early movies have her credited as \\"Georgette McKee\\", her stepfather's name). King appeared uncredited in the Bette Davis film Mr. Skeffington (1944), followed by another ten movies in the next three years. The Warner Bros. studio photographers voted King the most photogenic actress for the year 1945. She co-starred in the mystery-horror film, The Beast with Five Fingers (1946), and a drama, The Man I Love (1947), both opposite Robert Alda. King was originally cast to play Dr. Lilith Ritter in Nightmare Alley, a film noir directed by Edmund Goulding, but she chose instead the role of the sophisticated Marjorie Lundeen in Ride the Pink Horse (1947). In the 1950s, King had leading roles in the film noirs Dial 1119 and Southside 1-1000 (both 1950) and a science-fiction story, Red Planet Mars (1952). She later played supporting roles in Hollywood feature films like The World in His Arms (1952) with Gregory Peck and Band of Angels (1957) with Clark Gable. ===Television=== In the 1960s and 1970s, most of her acting work was on television, including the ABC/Warner Brothers Television western series Maverick episode \\"Two Tickets to Ten Strike\\" opposite James Garner. In 1959‚Äì1960, King appeared twice as \\"Duchess\\" in the episodes \\"The Blizzard\\" and \\"The Devil Made Fire\\" of another ABC/WB western series, The Alaskans, starring Roger Moore, Jeff York, Ray Danton, and Dorothy Provine, as well as in multiple episodes of the ABC/WB private-eye series 77 Sunset Strip and Hawaiian Eye. She made four guest appearances on Perry Mason between 1959‚Äì1963, including the role of murderer Barbara Heywood in the 1959 episode, \\"The Case of the Bedeviled Doctor\\". King continued to act on television until 1990 when she played her final role on the Murder, She Wrote episode, \\"The Fixer-Upper\\". She appeared twice more as herself on the A&E; series, Biography, recalling her work with Peter Lorre and Montgomery Clift.

It operates in a music format predominantly featuring pop, but also broadcasts news, drama, comedy, and entertainment. During evening and weekend hours, programming moves to specialist content where presenters are free (within reason) to play whatever they wish. Bailrigg is one of the oldest student radio stations in the country,Although a contentious and hard to verify claim, this student society has long claimed it was the first of the UK student stations permitted a licence to actually start broadcasting. The claim of \\"first permanent FM student station\\" is a matter of interpretation. Radio Station Management reported back to society members during the negotiations that the Radio Authority believed the station to be the first to have a permanent FM licence. Oxford University later made the same claim. However, Bailrigg FM was from 1996 onwards limited to the campus of Lancaster University and broadcast initially only during term-time, whereas the colleges of Oxford University are spread across the city of Oxford, which made it the first permanent FM radio station run by students and available to the general public (and a rival to local independent radio for advertising revenue). Potentially the only way to verify any of the claims would be to access the archive of the Radio Authority (which is now a part of Ofcom). as well as being the first student station to broadcast on FM. It airs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, all year round. Bailrigg first broadcast on FM as part of a one-month, 25W Restricted Services Licence in March 1994 under the directorship of Paul Dale. It had previously applied for a licence in September 1993 but was turned down by the Radio Authority due to the launch of The Bay in March of that year. It originally broadcast to the university on 312m Medium Wave using an inductive loop aerial system around the various halls of residence. Now listeners can tune in on campus on 87.7 MHz, or listen anywhere in the world using the station's live webstream. Bailrigg holds several large events throughout the year, including a seven-day Freshers' Week outside broadcast and coverage of the Lancaster University Students' Union (LUSU) sabbatical elections. During the Roses Tournament the station joins with University Radio York (URY) to provide programming across both campuses. The station has received several national Student Radio Awards over the years, including Best Website, Best Station Sound and more recently Best Technical Achievement.Winners announced for Student Radio Awards - http://radiotoday.co.uk/2012/11/winners-announced-for- student-radio-awards/ It was announced in April 2019 that LUSU would stop funding the license required to broadcast FM frequencies, and as such the station would only be available online from August onwards. After protest over the decision however, funding was given in August for the license to be renewed. ==History== * 1968 ‚Äì Students at York University get permission to test-transmit programmes on Medium Wave, inspiring Lancaster to follow suit. * 1969 - After problems with an over-eager student starting his own pirate radio station, permission is finally given to proceed with the project. * 1971 - The initial aerial and studio equipment is installed. * 1972 - URB is forced off air by the government for transmitting without a full licence. * 1973 - A new antenna system is installed and URB gains a full licence from the government. * 1974 - Twin studios are built in Fylde College. * 1994 - First four-week 25W licence to broadcast on 87.7 MHz (under the name Bailrigg FM) is received. The broadcasts covered the City of Lancaster (including Morecambe).Details would appear in the minutes of the weekly society meetings, which should be in the archives of Lancaster University Student Union.Details of each FM launch were reported in the Lancaster University Student Newspaper \\"Scan\\", and should be available in their archives within Lancaster University Student Union. Reception was reported as far afield as Preston, Blackpool and Barrow-in- Furness. * 1995 - A second four-week FM licence is received, again on 87.7 MHz. * 1996 - URB gains a licence to broadcast all year round on the FM band, although on a smaller power output to cover the campus only. The station name is changed permanently to Bailrigg FM.The preparations and launch of the permanent FM station in 1996 were captured in a video documentary entitled \\"Listening To Images\\" which was created by undergraduate students as a module towards a degree. This is available to watch via Bailrigg FM's Youtube channel - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvnMU2aJlnc * 2004 - Bailrigg FM is awarded an extended licence to transmit across Lancaster and Morecambe for a week as part of the university's 40th anniversary celebrations. * 2006 - Bailrigg FM moves to new studios in Furness College * 2012 - Bailrigg FM is awarded ¬£8,500 in funding from the University's Alumni Fund in order to purchase outside broadcast equipment.Bailrigg FM awarded grant for outside broadcast equipment - http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/steps/features/bailrigg-calling-from-45-rpm- records-to-ipads/ * 2013 - Bailrigg FM is awarded ¬£65,000 in Capex funds from LUSU in order to renovate their studios. This will keep Bailrigg FM on air for at least another 5 years. * 2019 - LUSU announced it would strip Bailrigg FM of funding for its license. Due to widespread disapproval this decision was ultimately reversed. === Awards ===  Student Radio Awards  The following are Student Radio Awards presented by the Student Radio Association {  + !Year !Award !Content !Nominee !Result - 1996 Best Student Radio Station   rowspan=\\"2\\" Bailrigg FM  rowspan=\\"2\\" - 2002 Best Student Radio Station  - 2003 Best Website Award  Peter Price  rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:gold; vertical-align:middle; text-align:center;\\" Gold - 2004 Best Station Sound  Bailrigg FM - 2005 Specialist Music Programming 'The Rachel Neilman Experience' Rachel Neilman  -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2006 Best Journalistic Programming 'Newsbite' Victoria Kirby  style=\\"background:silver; vertical-align:middle; text-align:center;\\" Silver - Best Comedy & Drama Programming 'Project ComCom' Bailrigg FM  -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2007 Best Male Presenter  Kenny Donohue  style=\\"background:gold; vertical-align:middle; text-align:center;\\" Gold - Best Journalistic Programming ‚ÄòTravellers on campus‚Äô Bailrigg FM News Team  - 2008 Best Outside Broadcast 'Roses'  rowspan=\\"2\\" Bailrigg FM  c96;vertical-align:middle; text-align:center;\\" Bronze - 2012 Best Technical Achievement 'Bailrigg FM Field Switchboard'  style=\\"background:gold; vertical-align:middle; text-align:center;\\" Gold }  I Love Student Radio Awards  The following are I Love Student Radio Awards presented at the annual SRACon by the Student Radio Association. {  + !Year !Award !Nominee !Result !Ref. -  rowspan=\\"3\\" 2014 Best Audience Initiative  rowspan=\\"2\\" Bailrigg FM Highly Commended  rowspan=\\"3\\"  - Most Improved Station  -  rowspan=\\"2\\" Outstanding Contribution to Student Radio Stephen Robinson  -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2018 Sam Possible   - Hero Of The Moment Tom Pearson Highly Commended  }  Lancaster University Students' Union Student Media Awards  The following are Student Media Awards presented by Lancaster University Students' Union. {  + !Year !Award !Content !Nominee(s) !Result -  rowspan=\\"11\\" 2019  rowspan=\\"2\\" Best Entertainment/Lifestyle Content 'Monday Bailrigg Show' Adam Bragan, Jonny Bentley  -  rowspan=\\"3\\" 'The Summerfeld Chronicles'  rowspan=\\"3\\" Jordan Summerfield  - Best Design  -  rowspan=\\"2\\" Best Marketing  - 'Wednesday Bailrigg Show Promotional Video' Pascal Maguet, Alex George  - Best Interview 'Rethink Valentine's' Max Ell  -  rowspan=\\"2\\" Best Innovation 'Rethink' Max Ell, Luke Mader, Nick Hoffman  - 'LUCI 24 hour takeover' Lancaster University Comedy Institue  - Best Live Coverage 'Lancaster City FC Coverage'  rowspan=\\"2\\" Jonny Bentley  -  rowspan=\\"3\\" Best Sports Content 'Bailrigg Football Show'  -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 'Kick Out @ 2' Kyle McKenzie, Kamran Khan  -  rowspan=\\"9\\" 2020 Kamran Khan  - Best Lockdown Content 'Afternoon T' Tom Grayston  - Best Cultural Content 'K-Bops' Quin Pitcher  - Best Entertainment/Lifestyle Content 'Choose Life' Sophie Edwards, Finn Bracegirdle  - Best News/Politics Content 'Newsday Tuesday' Dan Woodburn  -  rowspan=\\"2\\" Best Live Coverage 'Union Elections' Bailrigg FM  - 'General Election Coverage' Bailrigg FM & SCAN  - Best Innovation 'Off Script Podcast' Oliver Crisp  - Best Marketing & Design 'BFM Branding, Logos & Show Banners' Angus Warrender  } ==Notable alumni== * Richard Allinson * James May * Paul Cornell * Andy Serkis * James Masterton * Paul Dale * Louis Barfe George \\"The Rock\\" Sanderson ==References * 87.7 Bailrigg FM Website Category:Radio stations in Lancashire Category:Student radio in the United Kingdom Category:Radio stations established in 1969 Category:Culture of Lancaster University ","title":"Bailrigg FM"},{"id":"2229835","text":"The voiced retroflex lateral flap is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages.

Shiner began his career as a science fiction writer, but then identified with cyberpunk, and later wrote more mainstream novels, albeit often with magical realism and fantasy elements. He was formerly a resident of Texas (and a member of the Turkey City Writer's Workshop), and now lives in North Carolina. Shiner graduated from Southern Methodist University in 1973. Several of his novels have rock music as a theme or main focus, especially the musicians of the late 1960s; for example, Shiner's 1993 novel Glimpses considers the great never-recorded albums of The Doors, Brian Wilson, The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix. Say Goodbye: The Laurie Moss Story (1999) focuses on a fictional up- and-coming female musician and her subsequent fall back down. Slam (1990) is immersed in skate punk and anarchist culture. Perhaps because novels with music as a major theme are not generally considered mainstream genre material, his work has frequently been overlooked. He is a contributing author to the George R. R. Martin-edited anthology Wild Cards, notably creating that universe's most powerful character, the tantric sex magic wielding pimp, Fortunato. In July 2007 Shiner created the web site Fiction Liberation Front (FLF) as a venue for his short stories. The stories are released under the Creative Commons license and are available in HTML and PDF formats. Since 2006, Shiner has been a card-carrying member of the radical labor union, the Industrial Workers of the World.https://www.scribd.com/doc/77024308/Industrial-Worker- Issue-1742-January-February-2012 On July 22, 2007, The News & Observer began publishing a weekly column by Shiner, titled \\"Graphic Scenes\\", about comics. ==BibliographyNovels=== *Frontera.

Ewen Edward Samuel Montagu, CBE, QC, DL, RNR (19 March 1901 ‚Äì 19 July 1985) was a British judge, Naval intelligence officer and author. He is best known for his leading role in Operation Mincemeat, a critical military deception operation which misdirected German forces' attention away from the Allied Invasion of Sicily in Operation Husky. ==Life and career== Montagu was born in 1901, the second son of Gladys Helen Rachel (Goldsmid) and Louis Montagu, 2nd Baron Swaythling. His family was Jewish. He was educated at Westminster School before becoming a machine gun instructor during the First World War at a United States Naval Air Station. After the war he studied at Trinity College, Cambridge and at Harvard University before he was called to the bar in 1924. One of his more celebrated cases as a junior barrister was the defence of Alma Rattenbury in 1935 against a charge of murdering her elderly husband at the Villa Madeira in Bournemouth. == Naval intelligence== Montagu was a keen yachtsman, and enlisted in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve in 1938. Because of his legal background he was reassigned to specialized study. From there he was assigned to the Royal Navy's East Yorkshire headquarters at Hull as an assistant staff officer in intelligence. Montagu served in the Naval Intelligence Division of the British Admiralty, rising to the rank of Lieutenant Commander RNVR. He was the Naval Representative on the XX Committee, which oversaw the running of double agents. === Operation Mincemeat === While Commanding Officer of NID 17M, he and Squadron Leader Charles Cholmondely RAFVR conceived Operation Mincemeat, a major deception operation. Montagu had the idea of having a corpse dressed as a British officer wash ashore in Spain, carrying faked papers revealing plans for invasion of Greece (the real target was Sicily). The location chosen was where pro-German Spanish officials would show the papers to German agents. Montagu also manufactured an entire false identity for the corpse to have in his pockets: military ID, theatre ticket stubs, love letters and a photo of his fianc√©e, bills from a tailor and jeweller. The Germans were fooled completely. German documents found after the war showed that the false information went all the way to Hitler's headquarters, and led to German forces being diverted to Greece. The invasion of Sicily was a success. Historian Hugh Trevor-Roper called it the best deception in the history of military deception. For his role in Operation Mincemeat, Montagu was appointed to the Military Division of the Order of the British Empire. == Later career == From 1945 to 1973 he held the position of Judge Advocate of the Fleet. He wrote The Man Who Never Was (1953), an account of Operation Mincemeat, which was made into a movie three years later. Montagu himself appeared in the film adaptation of The Man Who Never Was, playing an Air-Vice Marshal who had in real life disparaged his own character (played by Clifton Webb) in a briefing. Montagu also wrote Beyond Top Secret Ultra, which focused more on the information technology and espionage tactics used in World War II. He was a governor of a public health project, the Peckham Experiment, in 1949. Montagu was president of the United Synagogue, 1954‚Äì62, and President of the Anglo-Jewish Association from December 1949.Year book of the Anglo-Jewish Association 1951 Before the Courts Act 1971 he was Chairman of the Quarter Sessions for the Middlesex area of Greater LondonWhitaker's Almanack (1968) p.636 and recorder in the County of Hampshire. He was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of the County of Southampton. ==Family== Montagu's youngest brother Ivor Montagu was a film maker and Communist. Ewen Montagu married Iris, the daughter of the painter Solomon J. Solomon, in 1923. They had a son, Jeremy, who became an authority on musical instruments,Macintyre, Ben, (2010) Operation Mincemeat: The True Spy Story that Changed the Course of World War II, preface and a daughter, Jennifer, who became an art historian. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * * ==Further reading== * Category:1901 births Category:1985 deaths Category:English Jews Ewen Category:People educated at Westminster School, London Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Intelligence analysts Category:British military writers Category:Younger sons of barons Category:Operation Mincemeat Category:Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve personnel of World War II Category:Admiralty personnel of World War II Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Hampshire Category:Queen's Counsel 1901‚Äì2000 ","title":"Ewen Montagu"},{"id":"2229860","text":"NAA or Naa may refer to: ==Persons== * Naa Ashorkor (born 1988), Ghanaian actress and radio/ TV broadcaster * Naa Govindasamy (1946‚Äì1999), Singaporean Tamil-language writer and computer font developer * Naa Klordey Odonkor (born 1982), Ghanaian female entrepreneur, TV and radio presenter * Naa Someswara, well-known Indian writer of medicine and editor in Kannada ==Businesses and organizationsAirports and aviation=== * Narita International Airport Corporation, Japan * Narrabri Airport (IATA code NAA), New South Wales, Australia * National Aeronautic Association, US * National Aviation Academy, training school in the US * National aviation authority or civil aviation authority, in each country * North American Airlines, founded 1989, ceased operations 2014 * North American Aviation, major US aerospace manufacturer from 1928 to 1967 * Norwegian Air Argentina, an Argentinian airline ===In other fields=== * National Academy of Arbitrators, US and Canada * National Academy of Arts, Bulgaria * National Anthropological Archives of the Smithsonian Institution, US * National Archives of Australia * National Assessment Agency, in the UK Department for Education and Skills * National Association of Actors, a Mexican television and motion picture performers union * National Auctioneers Association, US * Newspaper Association of America, a trade association * Nigerian Accounting Association * North American Arms, an arms company ==In science and technology== * 1-Naphthaleneacetic acid, a synthetic auxin (organic compound and plant hormone) * N-Acetylaspartic acid, a neurochemical often imaged in magnetic resonance spectroscopy * Neutron activation analysis, a nuclear process used for determining the concentrations of elements in materials * Nicotinamide, also called niacinimide, the amide of nicotinic acid * No abstract available bias, an academic tendency to preferentially cite journal articles that have an abstract available online * Nucleic acid amplification, a molecular biology technique for replicating segments of DNA * Network Address Authority, iSCSI terminology ==Other uses== * National Arabic Alphabets, in the Unicode standard * VLF Transmitter Cutler (call-sign NAA), a radio station in Cutler, Maine, operated by the United States Navy * NAA (Arlington, Virginia) a Navy radio facility located in Arlington, Virginia from 1913 to 1941 ","title":"NAA"},{"id":"2229865","text":"The Sufris ( a·π£-·π¢ufriyya) were Khariji Muslims in the seventh and eighth centuries.

It was Saddam Hussein's preferred place to meet visiting heads of state. The United States spared the palace during its shock and awe raid during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, in the belief that it might hold valuable documents. The Green Zone developed around it. The palace itself served as the MNF-I Headquarters of coalition troops during the Occupation of Iraq as well as the primary base of operations for the American diplomatic mission in Iraq until the opening of the new US Embassy in Baghdad in 2009. == Early history == The palace was officially commissioned by King Faisal II of Iraq in the 1950s as the new principal Royal residence following his planned wedding to Egyptian Princess Sabiha Fazila Khanim Sultan. The architect was J. Brian Cooper of Birmingham, renowned for his modernist designs. The architect's watercolour, drawn by Lawrence Wright, shows that the then Royal Palace was originally designed to be only the central section under the dome with two wings. The rest of the building, extending out from these three sections, was added under Saddam Hussein, including large bronze portrait heads on the roof. The fountain in front of the Royal Palace was part of the original design. The young King would never live in the palace, as he was assassinated before his wedding in the 1958 coup. The palace was thus renamed the Republican Palace. Baghdad My Beloved In the early 1990s, Saddam sponsored a competition for original works of art for his palaces. Nahla, an Iraqi artist, architect, and member of the Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra, submitted a work on paper for a mural. She won first prize in the competition and her work was realized as shown, in the north wing of the Republican Palace, in stone, by other craftsman. She was allowed no part in the development of the mural and in fact, to this day, she has not seen it in person. Her first view of the completed mural was a photograph on a website. Nahla is currently living in exile in Paris, France. Nahla's title of the piece, included in Arabic across the face of the mural, is Baghdad My Beloved. == Recent history == Before the new denizens moved in, the Palace was completely vacant and somewhat emptied by looters as some of the heavy brass gilded doors had been taken. This building in particular wasn't the reason that 4/64 Armor (3rd Infantry Division) and 1/6 Infantry (1st Armored Division) were securing this area. This entire area was home and office to all of the key Ba'ath Party officials and most of the documents and items being sought by the coalition forces. When the coalition forces rolled into this area on April 9, 2003, most of the occupants simply fled as fast as they could, taking only what they could carry. === Palace use === View of the Grand Dining Hall inside the Republican Palace As early as April 2003, some of the first tenants had started to occupy office space in the Palace, such as Andrew Goledzinowski (ORHA), of the Australian Foreign Affairs Council, charged with the task of setting up the new Iraqi Ministry of Justice. However, in May 2003, the Republican Palace was still mostly vacant as, until then, no one had realized that it was uncontrolled and space was available on a first-come, first-served basis. Charlie company 3/124 infantry of the Florida Army National Guard settled among the orange groves behind the palace and successfully provided security for the palace and a large portion of the sector from April 2003 to Feb 2004. The influx of civilians to the Palace was immediate beginning with ORHA, US Department of Defense personnel, US State Department, and their respective contractors including the civilian life- support/logistics contracting company. In about a week, the Palace filled to absolute capacity with people commandeering any and every niche they could find to work in. Because there wasn't yet any central control of the building itself there were cases where people laid claim to the broom and supply closets. Work spaces doubled as sleeping space, except when the office was already filled. It was a frequent sight when walking the hallways to see someone sleeping on the floor. Because of the heat, it became common to see men and women in various states of undress as they slept while others worked only feet away. ===Moving out=== During the time that the ORHA was reorganized into the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), new housing areas were assembled in the Palace grounds. People readily moved their sleeping areas out of the offices and halls and into small two-person units at the back of the Palace towards the river. When the changeover of power occurred in June 2004, the CPA went away and the US State Department assumed administrative control of what was now seen as a US asset. The palace now became the temporary US Embassy in Baghdad while the new embassy was being constructed down the road. === PCO offices === In addition to housing office space for the US Embassy staff, the palace also served as headquarters for the Army's Program Management Office (PMO), later Project and Contracting Office (PCO), while the PCO's off-site location was under construction. This lasted for quite some time as there were problems getting their own compound built. For this reason, the relatively new annex on the south wing of the Palace was dubbed the \\"PCO Annex.\\" This was the same annex that a rocket struck on the night before the first elections in January 2005. The rocket fatally wounded two PCO members even though it did not explode. The PCO moved to their own compound elsewhere in the Green Zone in October 2005. Up until mid-2005, there were many organizations using the Palace for office space but it was not for reasons of centralization at all - far from it. The place was crammed with people and information flow was inefficient at best. The main reason is that it was the only large hard-structure building that provided better protection from incoming mortars and at the same time was on a compound that is relatively easy to secure at a respectable distance from the building itself. === Dining facility === Until July 2005, there was a central dining facility inside one of the ballrooms. This caused many problems as the Palace was not designed for the foot-traffic flows in excess of 10,000 people a day. There was rarely a meal served where the central-south wing of the first floor was not crammed with people, as this was the only dining facility (DFAC) that the coalition forces had set up for a long time. This was not a ballroom; it was the Republican Congress meeting room. It had a round table encompassing the entire room. This was removed and converted into a mess hall in the fall of 2003. == Pool == View of the rear of the palace with pool area Behind the palace is a semi-kidney-shaped swimming pool with a multi-level diving platform and a stone cabana/pool house on the side. ==Current stability== While still a highly secured area, most of the organizations have long since found other, less cramped, working conditions on other locations in the International Zone (Green Zone). In the past, there were days of jockeying through one particularly notorious doorway in the middle of the long corridor called \\"Choke-Point Charlie\\". == External links == Category:Iraqi monarchy Category:Palaces in Iraq Category:Official residences in Iraq Category:Saddam Hussein ","title":"Republican Palace"},{"id":"2229884","text":"The serratus anterior is a muscle that originates on the surface of the 1st to 8th ribs at the side of the chest and inserts along the entire anterior length of the medial border of the scapula. The serratus anterior acts to pull the scapula forward around the thorax. The muscle is named from Latin: serrare = to saw, referring to the shape, anterior = on the front side of the body. ==Structure== Serratus anterior normally originates by nine or ten slips (muscle branches) from either the first to ninth ribs or the first to eighth ribs. Because two slips usually arise from the second rib, the number of slips is greater than the number of ribs from which they originate. The muscle is inserted along the medial border of the scapula between the superior and inferior angles along with being inserted along the thoracic vertebrae. The muscle is divided into three named parts depending on their points of insertions: #the serratus anterior superior is inserted near the superior angle #the serratus anterior intermediate is inserted along the medial border #the serratus anterior inferior is inserted near the inferior angle. ===Relations=== The serratus anterior lies deep to the subscapularis, from which it is separated by the subscapularis (supraserratus) bursa. It is separated from the rib by the scapulothoracic (infraserratus) bursa. ===Nerve supply=== The serratus anterior is innervated by the long thoracic nerve (Nerve of Bell), a branch of the brachial plexus. The long thoracic nerve travels inferiorly on the surface of the serratus. The nerve is especially vulnerable during certain types of surgery (for example, during lymph node clearance from the axilla (e.g., in case of axillary dissection in a surgery for breast cancer)). Damage to this nerve is the most common cause of winged scapula. ==Function== All three parts described above pull the scapula forward around the thorax, which is essential for anteversion of the arm. As such, the muscle is an antagonist to the rhomboids. However, when the inferior and superior parts act together, they keep the scapula pressed against the thorax together with the rhomboids and therefore these parts also act as synergists to the rhomboids. The inferior part can pull the lower end of the scapula laterally and forward and thus rotates the scapula to make elevation of the arm possible. Additionally, all three parts can lift the ribs when the shoulder girdle is fixed, and thus assist in respiration. The serratus anterior is occasionally called the \\"big swing muscle\\" or \\"boxer's muscle\\" because it is largely responsible for the protraction of the scapula ‚Äî that is, the pulling of the scapula forward and around the rib cage that occurs when someone throws a punch. The serratus anterior also plays an important role in the upward rotation of the scapula, such as when lifting a weight overhead. It performs this in sync with the upper and lower fibers of the trapezius.For Strong Healthy Shoulders, Functional Anatomy Surrounding the Scapulae by Bill Hartman and Mike Robertson. ==Other animals== The muscles of the shoulder can be categorized into three topographic units: the scapulohumeral, axiohumeral, and axioscapular groups. Serratus anterior forms part of the latter group together with rhomboid major, rhomboid minor, levator scapulae, and trapezius. The trapezius evolved separately, but the other three muscles in this group evolved from the first eight or ten ribs and the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae (homologous to the ribs). Functional demands have resulted in the evolution of individual muscles from the basal unit formed by the serratus anterior. In primitive life forms, the main function of the axioscapular group is to control the movements of the vertebral border of the scapula: fibers concerned with the dorsal movement of scapula evolved into the rhomboids, those with ventral motion into serratus anterior, and those with cranial movements into levator scapulae. The evolution of the serratus anterior itself has resulted in (1) grouping of its distal and proximal fibers, (2) size reduction of its intermediate fibers, and (3) the insertion of its dominant superior and inferior parts onto the superior and inferior angles of the scapula. In primates, the thoracic cage is wide and the scapula is rotated onto its posterior side to have the glenoid cavity face laterally. Additionally, the clavicle takes care of medial forces. In cursorial mammals (for example the horse and other quadrupeds), the scapula is hanging vertically on the side of the thorax and the clavicle is absent. Therefore, in climbing animals, the serratus anterior supports the scapula against the reaction forces of the free limb and exerts high bending forces on the ribs. To sustain these forces, the ribs have a pronounced curvature and are supported by the clavicle. In cursorial animals, the thorax is hanging between the scapulae at the serratus anterior and pectoralis muscles. ==Additional imagesSee also== *Pectoralis minor muscle *Serratus posterior inferior muscle *Serratus posterior superior muscle *Backpack palsy ==NotesReferences== * * * ==External links== * * ‚Äì \\"Superficial muscles of the anterior chest wall.\\" * ‚Äì \\"Schematic illustration of a transverse section through the axilla.\\" * Category:Muscles of the torso ","title":"Serratus anterior muscle"},{"id":"2229887","text":"Route 83 is a state highway in western Missouri.

For example, a depression scale may lack content validity if it only assesses the affective dimension of depression but fails to take into account the behavioral dimension. An element of subjectivity exists in relation to determining content validity, which requires a degree of agreement about what a particular personality trait such as extraversion represents. A disagreement about a personality trait will prevent the gain of a high content validity. ==On content validity== Content validity is different from face validity, which refers not to what the test actually measures, but to what it superficially appears to measure. Face validity assesses whether the test \\"looks valid\\" to the examinees who take it, the administrative personnel who decide on its use, and other technically untrained observers. Content validity requires the use of recognized subject matter experts to evaluate whether test items assess defined content and more rigorous statistical tests than does the assessment of face validity. Content validity is most often addressed in academic and vocational testing, where test items need to reflect the knowledge actually required for a given topic area (e.g., history) or job skill (e.g., accounting). In clinical settings, content validity refers to the correspondence between test items and the symptom content of a syndrome. One widely used method of measuring content validity was developed by C. H. Lawshe. It is essentially a method for gauging agreement among raters or judges regarding how essential a particular item is. Lawshe (1975) proposed that each of the subject matter expert raters (SMEs) on the judging panel respond to the following question for each item: \\"Is the skill or knowledge measured by this item 'essential,' 'useful, but not essential,' or 'not necessary' to the performance of the construct?\\" According to Lawshe, if more than half the panelists indicate that an item is essential, that item has at least some content validity. Greater levels of content validity exist as larger numbers of panelists agree that a particular item is essential. Using these assumptions, Lawshe developed a formula termed the content validity ratio: CVR = (n_e - N/2)/(N/2) where CVR= content validity ratio, n_e= number of SME panelists indicating \\"essential\\", N= total number of SME panelists. This formula yields values which range from +1 to -1; positive values indicate that at least half the SMEs rated the item as essential. The mean CVR across items may be used as an indicator of overall test content validity. Lawshe (1975) provided a table of critical values for the CVR by which a test evaluator could determine, for a pool of SMEs of a given size, the size of a calculated CVR necessary to exceed chance expectation. This table had been calculated for Lawshe by his friend, Lowell Schipper. Close examination of this published table revealed an anomaly. In Schipper's table, the critical value for the CVR increases monotonically from the case of 40 SMEs (minimum value = .29) to the case of 9 SMEs (minimum value = .78) only to unexpectedly drop at the case of 8 SMEs (minimum value = .75) before hitting its ceiling value at the case of 7 SMEs (minimum value = .99). However, it is important to understand when applying the formula to 8 raters, the result from 7 Essential and 1 other rating yields a CVR of .75. If .75 was not the critical value, then you would need 8 of 8 raters of Essential that would yield a CVR of 1.00. In that case, to be consistent with the ascending order of CVRs the value for 8 raters would have to be 1.00. That would violate the same principle because you would have the \\"perfect\\" value required for 8 raters, but not for ratings at other numbers of raters at either higher or lower than 8 raters. Whether this departure from the table's otherwise monotonic progression was due to a calculation error on Schipper's part or an error in typing or type setting is unclear. Wilson, Pan, and Schumsky (2012), seeking to correct the error, found no explanation in Lawshe's writings nor any publications by Schipper describing how the table of critical values was computed. Wilson and colleagues determined that the Schipper values were close approximations to the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. By comparing Schipper's values to the newly calculated binomial values, they also found that Lawshe and Schipper had erroneously labeled their published table as representing a one-tailed test when in fact the values mirrored the binomial values for a two-tailed test. Wilson and colleagues published a recalculation of critical values for the content validity ratio providing critical values in unit steps at multiple alpha levels. The table of values is the following one: N¬∞ of panelists Min.

It is the sole species in the monotypic genus Lamprocapnos, but is still widely referenced under its old name Dicentra spectabilis (now listed as a synonym). It is valued in gardens and in floristry for its heart-shaped pink and white flowers, borne in spring. Other common names include lyre flower, heart flower and lady-in-a-bath. ==Description== The two inner petals are made visible when the two pink outer petals are pulled apart. Their shape yields the common name \\"lady-in-a- bath\\".The Asian bleeding-heart grows to 120 cm (47 in) tall by 45 cm (18 in) wide. It is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial with 3-lobed compound leaves on fleshy green to pink stems. The arching horizontal racemes of up to 20 pendent flowers are borne in spring and early summer. The outer petals are bright fuchsia-pink, while the inner ones are white. The flowers strikingly resemble the conventional heart shape, with a droplet beneath ‚Äì hence the common name. The plant sometimes behaves as a spring ephemeral, going dormant in summer.[3]buds ==History== The first specimens were introduced to England from Asia in the 1840s by the Scottish botanist and plant hunter Robert Fortune. ==Cultivation== In a moist and cool climate, it will grow in full sun, but in warmer and drier climates it requires some shade. Aphids, slugs and snails sometimes feed on the leaves. Clumps remain compact for many years and do not need dividing. They have brittle roots which are easily damaged when disturbed. Root cuttings should be taken in spring. Seeds with whitish elaiosomes are borne in long pods. They must be sown while fresh. Division should be done in the late fall (autumn) or early spring. ===Cultivars=== The following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:- *Lamprocapnos spectabilis (pink and white) *'Alba' (white) *='Hordival' (red and white) 'Gold Heart', introduced from Hadspen Garden, England, in 1997,University of Vermont: Perry's Perennial Pages has yellow leaves. ==Toxins== Contact with the plant can cause skin irritation in some people from isoquinoline-like alkaloids.University of Vermont Department of Plant and Soil Science ==Gallery== File:Lamprocapnos spectabilis 001.JPGFoliage and buds File:GoldenDicentra.jpgCultivar 'Goldheart' File:Bleeding heart.jpgCultivar 'Alba' File:Lamprocapnos.jpgBleeding heart in backyard ==References Category:Fumarioideae Category:Monotypic Papaveraceae genera Category:Flora of Asia Category:Garden plants ","title":"Lamprocapnos"},{"id":"2229904","text":"Crashing may refer to: ==Television== * Crashing (UK TV series), a 2016 British comedy drama series * Crashing (U.S. TV series), 2017 American comedy series ==Books== *Crashing the Gate, a 2006 book by American political bloggers Markos Moulitsas and Jerome Armstrong *Crashing the Party, a 2002 book by Ralph Nader ==Film== *Crashing Hollywood (1931 film), a 1931 film directed by Fatty Arbuckle *Crashing Hollywood (1938 film), a 1938 film directed by Lew Landers *Crashing Las Vegas, a 1956 film starring the comedy team The Bowery Boys *Crashing the Water Barrier, a 1956 American short documentary film ==Music== *\\"Crashing Around You\\", a 2001 single by American heavy metal band Machine Head *Crashing the Ether, the seventh album by Tommy Keene *\\"Crashing Gates\\", a 2008 EP by Kevin Max *Crashing Through, a box set of the indie rock band, Beat Happening *\\"Always Crashing in the Same Car\\", a 1977 song by David Bowie *\\"Love's Crashing Waves\\", a 1984 single by Difford & Tilbrook *When Forever Comes Crashing, the third album by band Converge ==See also== * Crash (disambiguation) * Gate crashing, the act of entering an event without an invitation * Wedding crashing, the act of entering a wedding without an invitation ","title":"Crashing"},{"id":"2229906","text":"University Library of T√ºbingen (1910-1912) Pillar of Cologne Rodenkirchen Bridge (1939-1941; rebuilt after destruction in 1945 and since widened) Paul Bonatz (6 December 1877 ‚Äì 20 December 1956) was a German architect, member of the Stuttgart School and professor at the technical university in that city during part of World War II, and from 1954 until his death. He worked in many styles, but most often in a simplified neo-Romanesque, and designed important public buildings both in the Weimar Republic and under the Third Reich, including major bridges for the new autobahns. In 1943 he designed several buildings in Turkey, returning to Stuttgart in 1954. ==Life and career== Bonatz was born in Solgne, Alsace-Lorraine, then German Empire. In 1900, he finished his studies of architecture at the Technical University of Munich. He trained under Theodor Fischer, but unlike Fischer, did not join the Nazi party, and had actually briefly belonged to the SPD. After building several major buildings during the Weimar Republic, notably the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof (main station, 1913-1927), after the Nazis came to power he became architectural expert and advisor to Fritz Todt, the general inspector for German road building, and in this position built major bridges for the new Reichsautobahn system and with Hermann Giesler worked on the design for a planned new main station for Munich.Taylor, p. 114. The government tried to make good use of Bonatz's talents and name, but found him politically unreliable. He disliked Paul Troost's renovation of the K√∂nigsplatz in Munich and said so, a political mistake. In February 1935 he gave a speech inveighing against architecture which made \\"the act of representing an end in itself\\" rather than form coinciding with function in which he called Albert Speer's New Reich Chancellery \\"patently inadequate\\". Because of his vocal opinions, Bonatz was investigated twice by the police, who accused him of aiding Jews and being openly critical of Hitler. Although he won the competition to execute the gigantic glass dome for the new main station in Munich, he soon became disenchanted with Hitler's requiring the dome and critical of the entire design. This led him to leave Germany for Turkey in 1943.Taylor, p. 115.Frank, p. 157: \\"If I had to name a single reason for my emigration, it would have to be the escape from this madness.\\" He was a faculty member at the Istanbul Technical University from 1946 to 1954 and oversaw renovation of the university's Ta≈ükƒ±≈üla campus. While in Turkey he built many projects in Ankara, including a residential area with over 400 units and the reconfiguration of the Ankara Exhibition Hall into the Ankara Opera House, before returning to Germany in 1954 to participate in the reconstruction of Stuttgart and D√ºsseldorf. He was a professor at the University of Stuttgart from 1954 until his death in 1956. ==Private life== In 1902 he married Helene Fr√∂hlich (1879 - 1965); their daughter Susanne, born in 1906, married the architect Kurt D√ºbbers.\\"Bonatz, Paul Michael Nikolaus\\", LEO-BW, State of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, retrieved 20 October 2014 . His younger brother, Karl Bonatz, was also an architect and was chief planner of (West) Berlin succeeding Hans Scharoun. ==Works== Bonatz believed passionately in form expressing function, but opposed the modernist tradition exemplified by Neues Bauen and the Bauhaus, which he considered shallow, fashionable, and neglectful of local traditions. He was a founder and an important exponent of the Stuttgart School, which sought modern architectural solutions based on tradition.Frank, p. 146. He thus worked in a number of styles depending on purpose, although he was influenced by Fischer's movement toward a simplified masonry-based style based on German heritage and often used a simplified neo- Romanesque vocabulary, as in his 1927 Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof, his 1936 Kunstmuseum Basel (art museum), and the viaducts at the Drackensteiner Hang. The Stuttgart station, which was influential, has been seen as a transformation of historicism: the building itself was modern, the historical decor purely stylistic accents.Lane, pp. 14-16. Like Fischer, Heinrich Tessenow and German Bestelmeyer, he appealed to the Nazis because many of his works bore a clear relationship to traditional styles; Paul Schultze-Naumburg expressed the v√∂lkisch school's approval of the Stuttgart station as \\"a modern technical building in the best sense of the word.\\"Taylor, pp. 114-15. However, his autobahn bridge across the Rhine at Rodenkirchen (1939-1941) was an ultra- modern suspension bridge,Frank, pp. 154-55. he designed a number of dams and factories in addition to bridges, and at Kornwestheim he coupled a reinforced concrete water tower with offices on the lower floor with a hipped-roof town hall.Frank, p. 148. Bonatz's most famous building in Stuttgart is the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof (main station), built 1913-1927\\\\. On 25 November 2009 the station complex was nominated by UNESCO for possible inclusion in their World Cultural Heritage list. Bonatz also designed the library building of the University of T√ºbingen (built 1910-1912) and was involved in the final stages of the architectural design of the Sofia University Faculty of Biology building in Sofia, Bulgaria. The brick edifice was constructed in 1924-30 and was mostly designed by the Bulgarian architect Georgi Ovcharov, who worked the project out at Bonatz's office in Stuttgart. Among his technical buildings, he built bridges from the start of his career, beginning at Ulm in 1907 and including a slender bridge over the Neckar at Heidelberg in 1927. For the autobahns, he oversaw all bridge design and himself designed many of the innumerable small bridges required. In the 1920s he was responsible for ten dams on the Neckar; he used different construction materials to reflect the local geology.Frank, pp. 150-53.

Otto March designed Germany's 1916 Olympic stadium. Werner March was born in Charlottenburg and died in Berlin. For the 1936 Summer Olympics in Germany, March created his most famous work, Berlin Olympic Stadium, which was on the site of the Deutsches Stadion, a stadium designed by his father, Otto March for use in the 1916 Summer Olympics (which were later cancelled after the outbreak of World War I). It is unclear whether March was influenced to use a more conservative design to suit Nazi tastes (claimed by Albert Speer), or whether March devised a grand, sweeping architecture that anticipated the spirit of the Third Reich. The stadium, which has a capacity of 74,228, is one of the Germany's major sports venues and was used both for the 1974 and 2006 FIFA World Cup. He also created plans for the Central Stadium (Leipzig, GDR). He designed Carinhall, Hermann G√∂ring's hunting lodge-style country residence near Berlin. During 1956 to 1960 he designed the Cairo International Stadium in Egypt. Designed as a multi-purpose stadium for the Olympic sports, it is primarily used as a venue for football games. Together with his brother Walter, Werner March won a gold medal in the Art competitions at the Summer Olympics in 1936. ==See also== * Nazi architecture ==References * Category:1894 births Category:1976 deaths Category:20th-century German architects Category:Olympic gold medalists in art competitions Category:Olympic silver medalists in art competitions Category:Medalists at the 1936 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic competitors in art competitions Category:Stadium architects ","title":"Werner March"},{"id":"2229944","text":"Jefferson laboratory at Harvard University. The experiment occurred in the left \\"tower\\". The attic was later extended in 2004. The Pound‚ÄìRebka experiment was an experiment in which gamma rays were emitted from the top of a tower and measured by a receiver at the bottom of the tower. The purpose of the experiment was to test Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity by showing that photons gain energy when traveling toward a gravitational source (the Earth). It was proposed by Robert Pound and his graduate student Glen A. Rebka Jr. in 1959, and was the last of the classical tests of general relativity to be verified (in the same year). It is a gravitational redshift experiment, which measures the change of frequency of light moving in a gravitational field. In this experiment, the frequency shift was a blueshift toward a higher frequency. Equivalently, the test demonstrated the general relativity prediction that clocks should run at different rates in different places of a gravitational field. It is considered to be the experiment that ushered in an era of precision tests of general relativity. ==Overview== Consider an electron bound to an atom in an excited state. As the electron undergoes a transition from the excited state to a lower energy state it will emit a photon with a frequency corresponding to the difference in energy between the excited state and the lower energy state. The reverse process will also occur: if the electron is in the lower energy state then it can undergo a transition to the excited state by absorbing a photon at the resonant frequency for this transition. In practice the photon frequency is not required to be at exactly the resonant frequency, but must be in a narrow range of frequencies centred on the resonant frequency: a photon with a frequency outside this region cannot excite the electron to a higher energy state. Now consider two copies of this electron-atom system, one in the excited state (the emitter), the other in the lower energy state (the receiver). If the two systems are stationary relative to one another and the space between them is flat (i.e. we neglect gravitational fields) then the photon emitted by the emitter can be absorbed by the electron in the receiver. However, if the two systems are in a gravitational field then the photon may undergo gravitational redshift as it travels from the first system to the second, causing the photon frequency observed by the receiver to be different to the frequency observed by the emitter when it was originally emitted. Another possible source of redshift is the Doppler effect: if the two systems are not stationary relative to one another then the photon frequency will be modified by the relative speed between them. In the Pound‚ÄìRebka experiment, the emitter was placed at the top of a tower with the receiver at the bottom. General relativity predicts that the gravitational field of the Earth will cause a photon emitted downwards (towards the Earth) to be blueshifted (i.e. its frequency will increase) according to the formula: :f_r=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1-\\\\dfrac{2GM}{(R+h)c^2}}{1-\\\\dfrac{2GM}{Rc^2}}}f_e, where f_r (f_e) is the frequency of the receiver (emitter), h is the distance between the receiver and emitter, M is the Earth's mass, R is the radius of the Earth, G is Newton's constant and c is the speed of light. To counteract the effect of gravitational blueshift, the emitter was moved upwards (away from the receiver) causing the photon frequency to be redshifted, according to the Doppler shift formula: :f_r=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1-v/c}{1+v/c}}f_e, where v is the relative speed between the emitter and receiver. Pound and Rebka varied the relative speed v so that the Doppler redshift exactly cancelled the gravitational blueshift: :\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1-v/c}{1+v/c}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1-\\\\dfrac{2GM}{(R+h)c^2}}{1-\\\\dfrac{2GM}{Rc^2}}}=1. In the case of the Pound‚ÄìRebka experiment h\\\\ll R. Therefore: :v \\\\approx \\\\frac {gh}{c} = 7.5√ó10‚àí7 m/s In the more general case when h ‚âà R the above is no longer true. The energy associated with gravitational redshift over a distance of 22.5 meters is very small. The fractional change in energy is given by Œ¥E/E, is equal to gh/c2 = 2.5√ó10‚àí15. Therefore, short wavelength high energy photons are required to detect such minute differences. The 14 keV gamma rays emitted by iron-57 when it transitions to its base state proved to be sufficient for this experiment. Normally, when an atom emits or absorbs a photon, it also moves (recoils) a little, which takes away some energy from the photon due to the principle of conservation of momentum. The Doppler shift required to compensate for this recoil effect would be much larger (about 5 orders of magnitude) than the Doppler shift required to offset the gravitational redshift. But in 1958 Rudolf M√∂ssbauer reported that all atoms in a solid lattice absorb the recoil energy when a single atom in the lattice emits a gamma ray. Therefore, the emitting atom will move very little (just as a cannon will not produce a large recoil when it is braced, e.g. with sandbags). This allowed Pound and Rebka to set up their experiment as a variation of M√∂ssbauer spectroscopy. The test was carried out at Harvard University's Jefferson laboratory. A solid sample containing iron (57Fe) emitting gamma rays was placed in the center of a loudspeaker cone which was placed near the roof of the building. Another sample containing 57Fe was placed in the basement. The distance between this source and absorber was 22.5 meters (73.8 ft). The gamma rays traveled through a Mylar bag filled with helium to minimize scattering of the gamma rays. A scintillation counter was placed below the receiving 57Fe sample to detect the gamma rays that were not absorbed by the receiving sample. By vibrating the speaker cone the gamma ray source moved with varying speed, thus creating varying Doppler shifts. When the Doppler shift canceled out the gravitational blueshift, the receiving sample absorbed gamma rays and the number of gamma rays detected by the scintillation counter dropped accordingly. The variation in absorption could be correlated with the phase of the speaker vibration, hence with the speed of the emitting sample and therefore the Doppler shift. To compensate for possible systematic errors, Pound and Rebka varied the speaker frequency between 10 Hz and 50 Hz, interchanged the source and absorber-detector, and used different speakers (ferroelectric and moving coil magnetic transducer). The reason for exchanging the positions of the absorber and the detector is doubling the effect. Pound subtracted two experimental results: # the frequency shift with the source at the top of the tower # the frequency shift with the source at the bottom of the tower The frequency shift for the two cases has the same magnitude but opposing signs. When subtracting the results, Pound and Rebka obtained a result twice as big as for the one-way experiment. The result confirmed that the predictions of general relativity were borne out at the 10% level. This was later improved to better than the 1% level by Pound and Snider.; Another test, Gravity Probe A, involving a space-borne hydrogen maser increased the accuracy of the measurement to about (0.01%). ==References * Physical Review focus story. * The Pound- Rebka experiment.

He eventually finished his studies in 1922, after they were interrupted by his participation in the First World War, which included a stay in a prisoner-of-war camp. In 1924, he joined Jakob K√∂rfer's architectural bureau in Cologne. In 1926 came his doctorate (\\"Promotion\\"). In 1929, Sagebiel took up a job in Berlin as a project leader and chief executive officer at the architect Erich Mendelsohn's office, but in 1932, he had to leave this job owing to the severe economic climate in Germany at that time. He worked as a construction foreman. After Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seized power in 1933, Sagebiel applied for membership in the NSDAP, and became a member of the Sturmabteilung (SA). Already by 1933, Sagebiel had, at his brother's suggestion, come to be at the Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule (\\"German Commercial Flyers' School\\"), which was a front organization involved more with Germany's air force buildup than with commercial flying. As of 1934, he was being trusted with planning, as well as overseeing construction of, numerous Luftwaffe barracks (in D√∂beritz, Berlin-Gatow and Kladow, to name a few) as leader of the special works unit. Sagebiel's austere building style, which when compared to Albert Speer's rather classicist tendencies came across as very stark and linear, was described as \\"Luftwaffe modern\\", owing not least to his close association with the Luftwaffe. With his earlier building of the Reich Air Transport Ministry for Hermann G√∂ring, which came earlier than Albert Speer's exertion of influence on the National Socialists' architectural parlance, Sagebiel set a trend that would be recognizable throughout the Third Reich. From 1938, he was directly subordinate to the Air Transport Minister, Hermann G√∂ring, and was thereby counted among the Reich's most important architects. In the same year, he became a professor at the Technische Hochschule Berlin. With the outbreak of war against the Soviet Union in 1941 came an end to all Sagebiel's building plans. == List of projects and plans == * Columbushaus, Berlin, Project management for Erich Mendelsohn * Reichsluftfahrtministerium, Berlin 1934 - 1935 * Tempelhof International Airport, Berlin 1935 - 1941 * Stuttgart Airport * Munich Riem Airport * B√ºcker Aircraft Works, Rangsdorf * Regional Air Command Centres in Kiel, K√∂nigsberg and M√ºnster * Luftwaffe schools in Berlin-Gatow, Dresden and Potsdam- == Literature == * Elke Dittrich: Ernst Sagebiel - Leben und Werk (1892 - 1970).

The science fiction series is a homage to the Super Robot shows of the 1970s and 1980s, executed with modern animation techniques and aesthetics. Set in the future, a giant fighting machine called the Aquarion is humanity's only effective weapon in the fight against the technologically advanced species called the Shadow Angels. Aquarion aired from April 4, 2005, to September 26, 2005, on TV Tokyo. An alternate retelling of the television series, the Genesis of Aquarion OVA, premiered on May 25, 2007. The television series is licensed in North America by Funimation. On February 14, 2006, it aired on MTV Italia. On April 27, 2009, the series made its North American television debut on the Funimation Channel. A sequel to the series titled was announced on February 25, 2011, and aired in 2012. ==Plot== Twelve thousand years in the past, mankind was at mercy of the mythical creatures known as , immortal winged beings with overwhelming powers and technology. That is, until one of their kind, Apollonius, fell in love with a female human warrior, Seliane. Apollonius joins forces with the humans to free mankind from oppression, by using the legendary giant fighting robot . Eleven years prior to the story, in a disaster referred to as the \\"Great Catastrophe\\" Earth's magnetic field shifted devastating significant parts of the world and killing off many of its inhabitants. Along with the disaster came the return of the Shadow Angels who had been in slumber in their city of since their battle with Apolonius. The Shadow Angels began invading human cites to harvest human beings, dubbing them \\"the wingless ones,\\" like cattle, to extract from the captured humans. Their prana serves as energy and nutrition not only to the Shadow Angels, but also to the legendary . The Shadow Angels facilitate their harvesting via giant, floating harvesting machines called which are guarded by giant mecha called . They are sentient machines, yet there are times when they are piloted by Shadow Angels. Ordinary weapons prove ineffective against the Cherubim, and rings of projectors around the remaining cities, tapping into Earth's strata to project a quantum shield to keep Shadow Angels from entering or materializing in them, provide only limited protection. However a human expedition under the leadership of Gen Fudo excavates three very technologically advanced fighter planes, and an organization called takes over the research of these planes, called , trying to identify how to use them. The three Vectors, colored mostly in white, are identified as the green , the blue , and the red . DEAVA discovers only people with special powers, called , can use the Vectors and the three Vectors are in fact the pieces of Aquarion, the same robot used to fight the Shadow Angels twelve millennia before. They also discover the Elements can ultimately unite the Vectors into one of three formations of the giant robot in battle, and can use it to fight and defeat the Cherubim. During the Elements' first sortie against the Cherubim by uniting the Vectors into a formation of Aquarion, they stumble on 13-year-old Apollo, who seems to be the reincarnation of Apollonius. They become convinced of this when he single-handedly takes control of the Vector Sol, unites the Vectors into the Solar Aquarion formation and defeats the enemy, thus causing him to be recruited by DEAVA to join their ranks. ==Religious ReferencesAge of Aquarius=== Age of Aquarius, also known as the Aquarian Age, was a concept popularized by Carl Gustav Jung. The Age of Aquarius was seen in contraposition with current the Age of Pisces: whereas the Age of Pisces represents duality and antithesis (thus, conflict), the Age of Aquarius is an age of synthesis and spiritualism (in some ways, a new golden age). In the New Age, because of the implications of love, comprehension and one-ness, it can be associated with the fourth chakra. Aquarion as a name is a reference to this concept, but the show digs deeper in symbolism in using the Aquarion as an instrument for a \\"new era of holy genesis,\\" managing to resolve conflict between the opposing parties of humans and Shadow Angels and showing a not-so- metaphorical process of oneness with the Earth. ===Yoga=== Aquarion's main theme references Indian lore. The word yoga is translated as \\"unite\\" and means \\"union with the divine through the integration of body, mind and spirit\\" (in Japanese, the word \\"kokoro\\" refers to both heart or mind, but is more often translated as just the heart). During Unification, the Elements merge their bodies, minds and spirits, but a real Unification of the Aquarion can only be obtained with a Shadow Angel on board, fitting the scheme of the divine element necessary into order to achieve true Unification and completing Aquarion's power. ===Prapti and the Infinity Punch=== Yogis are said to develop special powers called siddhis. One of them is called prapti (acquisition) and with this siddhi, the perfect mystic yogi can not only touch the moon, but he can extend his hand anywhere and take whatever he likes. In the series, the Solar Aquarion's Infinity Punch manages to reach the moon, although the real prapti should not involve greatly elongated arms, but rather the ability to cancel distances between objects (resulting in the idea of omnipresence). In this sense, the real prapti in the show is perhaps used by Gen Fudo, who makes things appear out of nothing from his hand. It is worth noting another siddhi called Mahima is the ability to become incredibly big; this may be referenced to the Aquarion's ability to expand itself in size during particular battles with the Cherubim. ===Apollonius=== The character Apollonius is a passing nod to Greek mythology, seemingly inspired by Apollo, the Greek god of light and Prometheus, who gave fire to humans and was punished by Zeus by having an eagle feast on his liver. Similarly, Apollonius is a Shadow Angel who seems to have light-like powers and gives the humans a fighting chance against the Shadow Angels with the Aquarion, but loses his wings as punishment from the other Shadow Angels. Like Apollonius of Tyana, Aquarion's Apollonius dies and is believed to be reincarnated as the protagonist Apollo, while the Greek god Apollo is stated to have been born in the bank of a lake, Aquarion's Apollo is given his name after he swims in a lake. ===The Tree of Life=== Atlandia's Tree of Life took on two roles throughout the series. It is basically a large pile of multicolored flowers. The arrangement of the flowers at the end of the top central flowering portion can be easily seen forming the ten interconnecting nodes of the Sephirot from Hebrew Bible/Christianity, only that the flower at the top middle center of this arrangement, the spot that is supposed to symbolize the unity of the nodes, is absent. The tree's first role was made by the Shadow Angels to use it to restart the Shadow Angel race. The second role was its original role and was a similar function to its name, it literally contained the entire planet's life force. Because of this, if that force was unleashed as a power such as to give birth to a race of species, the planet would become lifeless and the tree would die, causing its remains to fall to the Earth's core and make the planet fall apart. This was something the Shadow Angels, who had possession of and took care of the tree, oddly did not know. ==Theme music== ;Opening songs # by Akino (Episodes 1-17) # \\"Go Tight!\\" by Akino (Episode 18-26) ;Ending songs # by Yui Makino # by Akino # \\"Celiane\\" by Gabriela Robin ;Other themes * by Akino * \\"Genesis of Aquarion\\" by Akino (English lyrics by Bless4) * by AKINO from bless4 Yoko Kanno is the composer of the soundtrack music.

The Fantastic Four witness this and, knowing that they are outmatched, Mister Fantastic contacts the cosmic entity Galactus and presents a proposal ‚Äî if Galactus will defeat the Sphinx, then Mister Fantastic will release him from his vow to never threaten the Earth again. Galactus accepts, and after the Fantastic Four find Galactus a new Herald (Terrax), the group travel to Earth. Galactus defeats the Sphinx, and after crushing his Ka Stone sends him back in human form to ancient Egypt. The character is trapped in a time loop, forcing Anath-Na to constantly relive his life to this point.Fantastic Four #206 - 213 (May - Dec. 1979) An issue of the title Marvel Two-In-One continues the story, as Anath-Na relives his life several times until due to a chronal flaw he is able to meet himself, and so warns the younger Anath-Na as to his future. The two then build a machine to reconstruct the Ka Stone, and after hypnotizing the younger version of Anath-Na so he would not remember, the future version enters suspended animation. The future version of the Sphinx awakens after Galactus departs, and begins to rebuild the Ka Stone. The hero the Thing, however, battles the Sphinx to a standstill and destroys the machine, leaving the Sphinx with an incomplete Stone.Marvel Two-In-One #91 (Sep. 1982) The Sphinx departs, but on learning that the incomplete Ka Stone is losing all power seeks revenge of the Thing. The villain Puppet Master assists the Thing and forces the Sphinx to crush the Ka Stone; as a result Anath-Na immediately ages five thousand years and crumbles to dust.The Thing #34 (Apr. 1986) As part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel event, Sphinx obtained Nadeen Hassan's brother Navid as an apprentice where he helped Sphinx retrieve numerous Egyptian artifacts from the San Francisco Museum of Egyptian Culture.Howling Commandos of S.H.I.E.L.D. #3 ===Meryet Karim=== Meryet Karim is a desert nomad who finds an unconscious Anath-Na Mut soon after he finds the Ka Stone. In nursing him back to health, Karim absorbs residual energies from the Ka Stone which grant her a fraction of its power. Karim found that after death she was being perpetually reincarnated into new bodies and retains the knowledge of her previous lives with each rebirth. In the modern era, Karim finds the remnants of the Ka Stone and reconstructs it to become the new Sphinx. Karim then alters history so that Anath-Na Mut kills Moses which leads to Egypt eventually conquering the world and leading to the Forever Yesterday storyline. Karim is thwarted by the superhero team the New Warriors and she resurrects Anath-Na in a bid to reclaim his love. The newly empowered Anath-Na battles the New Warriors. But when forced to face his feelings for Karim, he decides to merge with her into a composite entity which goes back in time to live a normal life.New Warriors #47 - 50 (May. - Jul. 1994); Nova #6 - 7 (Jun. - Jul 1994); Night Thrasher vol. 2, #11 - 12 (Jun. - Jul. 1994) The gestalt entity has a final appearance in the title the New WarriorsNew Warriors #68 - 70 (Feb. - Apr. 1996) before reappearing as the male Sphinx in the third volume of the title Nova. The character discovers that Galactus' curse is still in effect and battles Nova once again, intent on having access to Xandarian knowledge.Nova vol. 3, #1 (May 1999); #3 - 6 (July - Oct. 1999) The Sphinx appears in an issue of the fourth volume of the title Nova.Nova vol. 4, #20 (Feb. 2009) ==Powers and abilities== The Sphinx is an ancient mutant, who has gained additional abilities through use of the Ka Stone, and other sources. The character possesses superhuman strength, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes, and virtual immortality. Courtesy of the Ka stone, the Sphinx also possess a range of metaphysical abilities including energy projection; telepathy; teleportation and flight.

Such policies are often mandated to be described in detail in specific sections of a company's annual or quarterly reports. Adopting specific accounting policies and procedures (such as Sarbanes Oxley) is one method organization's use to ensure adequate controls and transparency in financial reporting, to minimize the risk of fraud. Many accounting policies necessarily involve the subjective valuation of different items in order to give observers the best possible \\"snapshot\\" of a company's finances by looking at a single balance sheet or profit and loss statement. For example, a bank that has just made a lot of new loans would look good on one report, but if many of those borrowers later failed to repay then a subsequent report would look very bad. So generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) would require the bank management (and not the accountants) to estimate how many borrowers would fail to repay, and to include those losses alongside the new loans. While there are many situations common to almost all companies where management must make subjective accounting entries, critical accounting policies are often those particular to an industry or company, and are judged to be even more subjective then normal. One of the key reasons many investors and analysts pay attention to critical accounting policies is that their subjective nature is believed to be riper for abuse through creative accounting, especially slush fund accounting. In slush fund accounting, excess earnings from a good quarter or year are hidden by changing the subjective element of a critical accounting policy. The \\"hidden funds\\" can then be put back into the reported profit in a bad quarter. Companies do this because of a general belief that the ideal company is one that is always consistently and smoothly increasing earnings. For example, a clothing store does not show the profit on all the sales it made in the current quarter because it knows that some of those clothes will be returned later and it will have to give back the money. To smooth earnings, in a good quarter managers can say that they believe that the amount of returns will be high. Then when they have a bad quarter, they can say that they had overestimated the value of returns and add the surplus back into that quarter's profit. ==Examples== Some examples of critical accounting policies are: *A clothing retailer accounting for inventory taking into consideration the fact that a rough balance of sizes is necessary for any particular piece of clothing on the sales floor *Bank's accounting for future unpaid loans *A manufacturer or a store accounting for future returned items *Mortgage companies accounting for mortgage servicing rights *The estimate of bad debts *Accounting for the value of derivatives *Selecting an appropriate rate and method of depreciation of fixed assets ==References== US Securities and Exchange Commission statement: Category:Corporate finance ","title":"Critical accounting policy"},{"id":"2229976","text":"The voiceless retroflex lateral fricative is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages.

As he grew up, Carlo Mollino became interested in a variety of topics that were as outrageous as his art, such as design, architecture, the occult, and race cars. He was once credited as saying, \\"Everything is permissible as long as it is fantastic.\\" That credo was certainly reflected throughout his body of work. Mollino's architecture and furniture are famous for their ability to enable occupants to manipulate volumes at a whim. Carlo Mollino died in 1973, while still working. == Architecture == Casa del Fascia, Voghera In 1930, Carlo Mollino started his career as an architect designing a house in Forte dei Marmi and receiving the G. Pistono prize for architecture. Between 1933 and 1948, he worked in his father's office, and took part in several architecture competitions (e.g. the Farmers Association Building in Cuneo, the Fascist House in Voghera, and, after World War II, the Monument to the Partisan, which was created in collaboration with the sculptor Umberto Mastroianni. The Monument to the Partisan was placed in the Generale cemetery of Turin after winning the competition. Between 1936 and 1939, Mollino designs, in collaboration with Vittorio Baudi di Selve, the Societ√† Ippica Torinese building in Turin, considered his masterpiece. However, this building was destroyed in 1960. This work breaks with the past and the regime, refusing the rationalist school and taking inspiration from Alvar Aalto and Erich Mendelsohn. Carlo Mollino loved the mountains and was a ski enthusiast; he wrote the book \\"Trattato sul Discesismo\\" where he explained his personal skiing technique with many illustrations. He designed some mountain houses like the Casa del Sole in Cervinia, Aosta Valley and the Slittovia of Lago Nero in Sauze d'Oulx, in Piedmont. In this work, all the art of Mollino is shown: a large, modern terrace protruding from the main volume contrasts with the traditional materials of the building. This building, placed on the ski runs and reachable during the winter only by ski, has been restored in 2001 and now contains temporary expositions. In 1952, Mollino designed the RAI Auditorium in Turin, which was radically restored bringing big changes to the original structure in 2006. In the first half of the sixties, he directed the team of architects responsible for the design of the INA-Casa district in Turin and he is placed second in the competition for the design of the Palazzo del Lavoro building in Turin, won by Pier Luigi Nervi, for the 100th anniversary celebration of the unification of Italy (1961). In the last years of his life (between 1965 and 1973) he designed the two buildings that made him famous: the Camera di Commercio building and the Teatro Regio Torino (Regio Theater), both in Turin. Before his death he completed the projects for the FIAT Directional Centre in Candiolo, the AEM building in Turin, and the Club Mediterran√®e in Sestriere. == Buildings == *Societ√† Ippica Torinese, Turin (1937, destroyed in 1960) *Slittovia del lago Nero, Sauze d'Oulx (1946) *House on the Agra plateau (1952) *Auditorium RAI, Turin (1952) *Casa del Sole, Cervinia (1955) *Widening of Aeroclub Torino building, Turin (1958) *Camera di commercio, Turin (1964) *Teatro Regio Torino, Turin (1973) == Apartments and interiors == *Casa Miller, Turin (1936) *Casa Devalle, Turin (1939-40) *Casa Minola, Turin (1944-46) *Casa Orengo, Turin (1949) *Casa Rivetti, Turin (1949) *Casa Mollino, Turin (1960-1968) *Casa Pistoi, Turin (1968) == Furniture == A world record price for a piece of 20th Century Furniture was set in June 2005 when a piece designed by Carlo Mollino was auctioned by Christie's New York: An oak and glass table for Casa Orengo from 1949 sold for $3,824,000.

These elements are created within the cell and then assembled on its surface in a more or less regular arrangement, giving the test a textured appearance. There is a single opening for the long slender pseudopods, which capture food and pull the cell across the substrate. Euglyphids are common in soils, marshes, and other organic-rich environments, feeding on tiny organisms such as bacteria. The test is generally 30-100 Œºm in length, although the cell only occupies part of this space. During reproduction a second shell is formed opposite the opening, so both daughter cells remain protected. Different genera and species are distinguished primarily by the form of the test. Euglypha and Trinema are the most common. The euglyphids are traditionally grouped with other amoebae. However, genetic studies instead place them with various amoeboid and flagellate groups, forming an assemblage called the Cercozoa.

In the naming of inorganic compounds, it is a suffix that indicates a polyatomic anion with a central aluminum atom.Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry IUPAC Recommendations 2005 ‚Äì Full text (PDF) ==Aluminate oxyanions== Aluminium oxide (alumina) is amphoteric: it dissolves in both bases and acids. When dissolved in bases it forms hydroxyaluminate ions in the same way as aluminium hydroxide or aluminium salts. The hydroxyaluminate or hydrated aluminate can be precipitated and then calcined to produce anhydrous aluminates. Aluminates are often formulated as a combination of basic oxide and aluminium oxide, for example the formula of anhydrous sodium aluminate NaAlO2 would be shown as Na2O¬∑Al2O3. A number of aluminate oxyanions are known: * The simplest is the approximately tetrahedral found in the compound Na5AlO4, * framework ions in anhydrous sodium aluminate NaAlO2 and monocalcium aluminate, CaAl2O4 made up of corner-sharing {AlO4} tetrahedra. * A ring anion, the cyclic anion, found in tricalcium aluminate, Ca3Al2O6, which can be considered to consist of 6 corner sharing {AlO4} tetrahedra. * A number of infinite chain anions in the compounds Na7Al3O8 which contains rings linked to form chains, Na7Al13O10 and Na17Al5O16 which contain discrete chain anions. ==Mixed oxides containing aluminium == There are many mixed oxides containing aluminium where there are no discrete or polymeric aluminate ions. The spinels with a generic formula that contain aluminium as Al3+, such as the mineral spinel itself, MgAl2O4 are mixed oxides with cubic close packed O atoms and aluminium Al3+ in octahedral positions.Wells A.F.

The glasses produced display a range of interesting and useful properties, such as high refractive index, good infrared transparency, and high melting point, as well as the ability to host laser active and fluorescent ions. Aerodynamic levitation is a key method used to study and produce many aluminate glasses. Levitation allows high purity to be maintained in the melt at temperatures in excess of .Haliakova, A., Prnova, A., Klement, R.D. and Tuan, W.H. \\"Flame-spraying synthesis of aluminate glasses in the Al2O3-La2O3 system\\". webofknowledge.com.

Some materials that are known to form glass in binary combination with aluminum oxide are: rare earth oxides, alkaline earth oxides (CaO, SrO, BaO) lead oxide, and silicon dioxide. Also, the Al2O3 (aluminate) system has been discovered to form sapphire-like glass ceramics. Often, this ability is based upon compositions in which interplay between glass forming ability and glass stability is approximately balanced. ==Applications of aluminates== Sodium aluminate, NaAlO2, is used industrially in dyeing to form a mordant and the hydrated forms are used in water purification, sizing of paper and in the manufacture of zeolites, ceramics and catalysts in the petrochemical industry. In the isomerization process of alkenes and amines Calcium aluminates are important ingredients of cements. Li5AlO4 is used in the nuclear power industry.Allen W. Apblett, \\"Aluminium: Inorganic Chemistry\\", (1994),Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry, ed. R.

This has led some residues to be made into new raw materials for many industries. Such an achievement ensures a reduction in energy and natural resource usage, decreasing of the negative environmental impact and creating new fields of work. A good example comes from the metals industry, particularly the aluminum industry. Aluminum recycling is a beneficial activity for the environment, since it recovers resources from both manufacturing and consumer waste. Slag and scrap which were previously considered as waste, are now the raw material for some highly profitable new industries. There is added-value in materials made using an aluminum residue which is currently considered as a hazardous waste. Current research is investigating the use of this waste to manufacture glass, glass-ceramic, boehmite and calcium aluminate.L√≥pez Delgado, A. and Tayibi, H. \\"Can hazardous waste become a raw material?

The band consisted of singer and bassist Mark Burgess, guitarists Reg Smithies and Dave Fielding, and drummer John Lever. They were called the Chameleons UK in North America because an American band had claim to \\"the Chameleons\\" name. The band released their debut album, Script of the Bridge, in 1983. They followed it with What Does Anything Mean? Basically and Strange Times in 1985 and 1986, respectively, before abruptly disbanding in 1987 due to the sudden death of the band's manager. After the split, Burgess and Lever formed the Sun and the Moon, while Fielding and Smithies formed the Reegs. Burgess also had a short solo career with backing band the Sons of God. The Chameleons reformed in 2000, releasing the albums Strip (2000), Why Call It Anything (2001), and This Never Ending Now (2002). Renewed tensions caused the group to separate again in 2003. Burgess alone continues to play Chameleons songs live under the name ChameleonsVox. Lever died in 2017. Known for their atmospheric, guitar-based sound, the Chameleons are regarded as one of the most underrated Manchester bands of the 1980s. They did not attain the commercial success of other groups from the Manchester scene but developed a cult following. ==HistoryEarly career=== The Chameleons were formed in Middleton, Greater Manchester, England in 1981 by Mark Burgess, Reg Smithies and Dave Fielding. Burgess previously played with the Cliches, while Smithies and Fielding had performed with Years. They started as a trio‚ÄîBurgess as vocalist and bassist, Smithies and Fielding both on guitar‚Äîwithout a drummer. They later recruited fellow Middletonian Brian Schofield, who was soon replaced by Dukinfield-based John Lever, previously of the Politicians. Former Magazine drummer Martin Jackson briefly replaced Lever during 1982‚Äì83 while the latter was on sabbatical. After performing several radio sessions for BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, the band were signed to Epic Records, then a subsidiary of CBS Records International, and in March 1982 released their debut single, \\"In Shreds\\", which was produced by Steve Lillywhite. The single's cover ‚Äì a harrowing painting by Smithies, who created the artwork for all of their releases ‚Äì mirrored the band's tense, atmospheric sound. During this time, the Chameleons' independent style clashed with their label's visions for the band. Wary of the loss of credibility Altered Images had suffered due to buckling to CBS' demands on packaging, the Chameleons were protective of their image and consequently were dropped by the label soon after the release of \\"In Shreds\\". The Chameleons subsequently signed to UK label Statik Records, a subsidiary of Virgin Records, on which they released their debut studio album, Script of the Bridge, in 1983. Script of the Bridge, featuring the singles \\"Up the Down Escalator\\", \\"As High as You Can Go\\" and \\"A Person Isn't Safe Anywhere These Days\\", showcased Burgess's strong vocals and the band's guitar-based sound, with careful use of synthesisers. Statik's status as a subsidiary of Virgin prevented the band from qualifying for the independent charts, which resulted in reduced coverage by the British music press. MCA Records released the album in the United States in an abridged form, minus four songs, which angered the band. However, the US release and a 1984 American tour did earn them significant college radio airplay and a loyal fanbase. Their second studio album, What Does Anything Mean? Basically, was released in 1985 by Statik, which also reissued \\"In Shreds\\" and its B-side \\"Less Than Human\\" as the 12\\" Nostalgia EP, adding the previously unreleased track \\"Nostalgia\\". Basically established the band as a promising, guitar-based group. Regular touring after the release of Basically, along with efforts by the band's manager, Tony Fletcher, persuaded David Geffen to sign the band to Geffen Records, which released their third studio album, Strange Times, in 1986. A dark, complex work, it contained the singles \\"Tears\\" and \\"Swamp Thing\\", but proved to be their final record of the period. A rift existed within the band, particularly between Burgess and Fielding, and Fletcher's sudden death in 1987 due to cardiac arrest led to the group disbanding. ===Post-breakup=== After the breakup, numerous spin-off bands emerged, none of which achieved much success. Burgess and Lever formed the Sun and the Moon, recruiting Andy Whitaker and Andy Clegg to replace Smithies and Fielding. They released an eponymous studio album on Geffen in 1988, but separated the next year. Burgess then embarked on a solo career, while the remaining members briefly continued on as Weaveworld. Smithies and Fielding formed the Reegs with the help of vocalist Gary Lavery and a drum machine, and released two albums, Return of the Sea Monkeys (1991) and Rock the Magic Rock (1992), on the independent label Imaginary Records. Burgess released his debut solo album, Zima Junction, in 1993, and toured America the following year with his backing band the Sons of God. He released another studio album, Spring Blooms Tra-La (1994), as well as a live album, Manchester 93 (1994), before partnering with Yves Altana in 1995, releasing Paradyning the same year. Afterwards, he founded Invincible with Altana and drummer Geoff Walker. They self-released their debut album, Venus, in 1999, with most sales being digital. He also worked with Bird, the Messengers and Black Swan Lane. Lever later joined Bushart, who released the album Yesterday Is History (2008). In 1990, the Chameleons posthumously released an EP, Tony Fletcher Walked on Water.... La La La La La-La La-La-La, with the title paying tribute to their former manager. They also issued numerous live albums and compilations. ===Reformation=== ChameleonsVox performing at Rock in den Ruinen 2013 in Dortmund. The Chameleons reconvened in January 2000 to prepare for a series of concerts in The Witchwood, Ashton-under-Lyne, one of the band's favourite venues, in May. May 2000 also saw the release of the album Strip, which featured old material in an acoustic format. The concerts were a success, and they expanded the reunion tour to include European dates in the summer and two California dates that fall. They released a new studio album, Why Call It Anything, in 2001, followed by another unplugged album, This Never Ending Now, in 2002 and a full American tour. Renewed tensions led to the band dissolving once again in early 2003. In 2009, Burgess and Lever reformed to play Chameleons back catalogue material, under the name ChameleonsVox. They issued an EP, M+D=1(8), in November 2013. In addition to Burgess and Lever, ChameleonsVox line-ups have included guitarists Roger Lavallee, Justin Lomery, Andrew Abernathy, Neil Dwerryhouse and Chris Oliver; bassists Frank Deserto and Jessica Espeleta; and drummers Glenn Maryansky, Yves Altana and Stephen Rice. Lever later went on to leave the band. In 2014, Lever and Fielding reunited to record an album, Endless Sea, as Red-Sided Garter Snakes. The album, featuring contributions from vocalist James Mudriczki of Puressence and Clegg, was released in July 2015. Lever died on 13 March 2017, following a short illness, at the age of 55. ==Musical style== During the Chameleons' early career, the British music press often used terms such as \\"sonic architects\\" and \\"sonic cathedrals\\" when describing the band, due to their atmospheric sound. Smithies and Fielding provided shimmering guitar riffs, while Lever and Burgess on drums and bass, respectively, gave the band a solid, rhythmic foundation. The Chameleons emerged as Thatcherism was beginning to have its effect on England's former industrial towns, and their music was imbued with a sense of anxiety and a longing for the security of innocence. Burgess's impassioned vocal delivery complemented his lyrics, which touched on the alienation created in many British communities by the decline of manufacturing and industry, and the consequent disruption of social order. Despite the bleak landscapes they were surrounded by, the band were not weighed down by their environment, but attempted to triumph over it. Burgess said in 2013 that, though growing up in a post-industrial, northern town must have some influence on one's music, he felt the Chameleons would have sounded similar regardless of where they originated from. ==MembersMain lineup=== *Mark Burgess ‚Äì vocals, bass (1981‚Äì1987, 2000‚Äì2003) *Reg Smithies ‚Äì guitar (1981‚Äì1987, 2000‚Äì2003) *Dave Fielding ‚Äì guitar (1981‚Äì1987, 2000‚Äì2003) *John Lever ‚Äì drums (1981, 1983‚Äì1987, 2000‚Äì2003) ===Other members=== *Brian Schofield ‚Äì drums (1981) *Martin Jackson ‚Äì drums (1982) *Kwasi Asante ‚Äì percussion (2001‚Äì2003) The core quartet were augmented by keyboardists Alistair Lewthwaite and Andy Clegg for live shows in the 1980s, and by percussionist-vocalist Kwasi Asante during their reunion period. ==DiscographyStudio albums=== * Script of the Bridge (1983, Statik Records/MCA Records) * What Does Anything Mean?

Fischer planned public housing projects for the city of Munich beginning in 1893. He was the joint founder and first chairman of the Deutscher Werkbund (German work federation, 1907), as well as member of the German version of the Garden city movement. In 1909 Fischer accepted a position as professor for architecture at the Technical University of Munich. Famous pupils of Fischer include Paul Bonatz, Hugo H√§ring, Ernst May, Erich Mendelsohn, JJP Oud, Bruno Taut, German Bestelmeyer and Paul Schmitthenner. Originally an imitator of historical styles, he changed direction, seeking a style which was closer to German tradition; his rediscovery of the expressive qualities of stone influenced many of his pupils, and his search for a more genuinely volkisch style explains his nationalist utterances in the early part of the Third Reich. Fischer described his own style as something between historicism and art nouveau. He tried to always work in the local context, and the socio-cultural character of the region, with an eye toward the social effect of his plans. == Bibliography == * (1988): Theodor Fischer: Architekt Und Staedtebauer, Wilhelm Ernst & Sohn Verlag fur Architektur und technische Wissenschaften (German edition) *Falko Lehmann (1988): Friedrich Theodor Fischer, 1803-1867: Architekt im Grossherzogtum Baden (Studien zur Bauforschung), Geiger-Verlag (German edition) ==External link== Category:19th- century German architects Category:1862 births Category:1938 deaths Category:People from Schweinfurt Category:Technical University of Munich alumni Category:Technical University of Munich faculty Category:Members of the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art Category:Art Nouveau architects Category:20th-century German architects Category:Bavarian architects ","title":"Theodor Fischer"},{"id":"2230038","text":"WEMF may refer to: *WEMF AG f√ºr Werbemedienforschung, a Swiss media company *World Electronic Music Festival, an electronic music event held annually in Canada ","title":"WEMF"},{"id":"2230039","text":"\\"Ace of Spades\\" is a song by English heavy metal band Mot√∂rhead and the title track to the album Ace of Spades. It was released as a single in October 1980. ==Overview== Initially issued as a 7\\" vinyl single on 27 October 1980 as a preview to the album Ace of Spades and autumn tour, the song was also released by Bronze Records as a 12\\" vinyl pressing in special Christmas picture sleeves, limited to 50,000 copies. The picture of the band in Santa outfits used on the cover was taken at the Aylesbury Fair, while the band were on tour. Bronze also issued German and Spanish 7\\" vinyl versions which had a different sleeves, as well as a Japanese release, with a colour picture insert with song lyrics in English and Japanese. One sided test pressings (not mis- presses, but used in the trade) escaped the pressing plant and are on the market. The song opens with an overdriven bass intro played by Lemmy. For the lyrics, he said he \\"used gambling metaphors, mostly cards and dice‚Äîwhen it comes to that sort of thing, I'm more into the one-arm bandits actually, but you can't really sing about spinning fruit, and the wheels coming down\\".Kilmister, Lemmy & Garza, Janiss. White Line Fever. Published: 2002, Simon & Schuster (Trade Division). . On 6 September 1980, Lemmy was interviewed by Graham Neale on BBC Radio 1's Rock on Saturday show, \\"Bomber\\", \\"Ace of Spades\\" and \\"Love Me Like a Reptile\\" were played. The following month, on 6 and 20 October, the band played the song on BBC TV show Top of the Pops.Burridge, Alan. Illustrated Collector's Guide to Mot√∂rhead. Published: 1995, Collector's Guide Publishing. . ==Commercial success== The song spent 13 weeks in the UK Singles Chart, and originally peaked at number 15 upon its initial release. At the midweek point in January 2016 it reached No. 9 and in the official Friday chart they reached number 13, following the death of frontman Lemmy in December 2015 and subsequent dissolution of the band. It has sold 208,830 digital copies as of January 2016. It reached the top of the UK Rock & Metal Singles and Albums Charts on 9 January 2016. ==Critical reception== The song ‚Äì which \\"put a choke on the British music charts and proved to all that a band could succeed without sacrificing its blunt power and speed\\" ‚Äì is considered the definitive Mot√∂rhead anthem, albeit not by Lemmy. \\"I don't see the song that way at all,\\" he said in 2000. \\"I believe we've done our best work since Eddie left the band in 1982.\\" In March 2005, Q placed it at No. 27 in a list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks, stating, \\"This song has an intro which wouldn't be out of place ushering in the end of the world.\\" In 2009, it was named the tenth greatest hard rock song of all time by VH1. In 2014, NME ranked it number 155 in a list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In May 2019, \\"Ace of Spades\\" was named the favorite poker- themed song in a survey of 1,000 customers of online poker site PokerStars.

The single has no picture sleeve; it was issued (and withdrawn) in a plain white paper cover. All three songs on the single appeared on the band's No Sleep at All live album, which was recorded at the Giants of Rock Festival in H√§meenlinna, Finland on 2 July 1988. The band had wanted \\"Traitor\\" as the A-side, but \\"Ace of Spades\\" was chosen instead, when the band noticed the change, they refused to allow the single to be distributed to the shops. So despite the popularity the song had achieved, this single was not as successful as the original version, which reached No. 15 in the UK Singles Chart in 1980, as it became only available at gigs and through the Mot√∂rheadbangers fan club. The song became a staple of the band's live set, with Lemmy acknowledging that despite becoming \\"sick\\" of performing it, they \\"can't ditch Ace of Spades, it wouldn't be right. If I go to see Little Richard, I expect to hear Good Golly Miss Molly, or I'd be pissed off\\". However, Lemmy softened his view on performing Ace of Spades live later on, saying \\"I used to have that thought occasionally, but I killed it. \\"Ace of Spades\\" has been really good to us, and it's one of the best songs that I ever wrote. So I suppose you have to put up with it, because everybody wants to hear it, every night.\\" Live versions have appeared on the albums No Sleep 'til Hammersmith (1981), N√∂ Sleep at All (1988), Everything Louder than Everyone Else (1999), Live at Brixton Academy (2003), Better Mot√∂rhead than Dead: Live at Hammersmith (2007), The W√∂rld Is Ours - Vol. 1: Everywhere Further Than Everyplace Else (2011), The W√∂rld Is Ours - Vol. 2: Anyplace Crazy as Anywhere Else (2012), and Clean Your Clock (2016). It was the first song that Phil Campbell and W√ºrzel played with the band ‚Äì on the \\"Bambi\\" episode of The Young Ones. The lineup is particularly rare until 1987: Lemmy, Campbell, W√ºrzel and Taylor. Taylor had already left the band by the time the filming started, but kept to his promise of making the performance. In September 1993, WGAF Records re-released the original 1980s track on CD-single, cassette single, 12\\" vinyl picture sleeve and picture disc versions, the song was coupled with \\"Louie Louie\\", \\"Dirty Love\\", and \\"Ace of Spades (The CCN Remix)\\", and although the band were not too pleased with the CCN Remix version, this single peaked at No. 23 in the UK chart. ===Single track listing=== # \\"Ace of Spades\\" (Lemmy, Eddie Clarke, Phil Taylor) # \\"Dogs\\" (Lemmy, W√ºrzel, Phil Campbell, Taylor) # \\"Traitor\\" (Lemmy, W√ºrzel, Campbell, Taylor) ==Cover versions== * New Zealand alternative rock band Shihad paid tribute to Lemmy's death by covering the song at the Rhythm and Alps festival in 2015. *British metal band Bullet for My Valentine covered the song for a special edition of their album Venom. *Ten American band Widespread Panic covered the song, most recently at a 2017 Halloween run of shows in Las Vegas, Nevada. * \\"Ace of Spades\\" was covered by Kobra and the Lotus, featuring guest guitarist Rik Emmett.

Cytisus monspessulanus or Teline monspessulana) also known as French broom, Montpellier broom and Cape broom, is a woody perennial shrub and a legume. The species is native to the Mediterranean region, and while it is commonly sold in garden stores, it is considered an invasive plant in most places where it has been introduced.Integrated Taxonomic Information System. Genista monspessulana, webpage for taxonomic serial number 502738 retrieved May 19, 2007. ==Description== French broom, Genista monspessulana, grows to tall, with slender green branches. The leaves are evergreen, trifoliate with three narrow obovate leaflets, long. The flowers are yellow, grouped 3-9 together in short racemes. Like other legumes, it develops its seeds within a pod. The pods are 2‚Äì3 cm long, tough and hard, and are transported easily by flowing water and animals. They burst open with force, dispersing the seeds several metres. The plant begins seed production once it reaches a height of approximately , and each plant can live for 10‚Äì20 years. One mature plant can produce 10,000 seeds per season. The generous seed production and the plant's ability to re-sprout after cutting or burning help it to invade new habitat vigorously when introduced. It is related to the common broom and Spanish broom. This suite of plants is common in European shrublands. French broom was originally distributed throughout Mediterranean Europe and northwest Africa, the Azores, and the Canary Islands. Due to its lower tolerance for frost than other broom species, it is common in warmer, lower elevation areas. It is found on coastal strips and in sunny inland areas, and does best with plentiful rainfall and sandy soils. Seedpods ==Invasiveness== When introduced to a new area, French broom can become an invasive plant. Its reproductive vigour and preference for Mediterranean climates make it a very successful species in California and the Pacific Northwest, where it is considered a severe noxious weed, covering over 40,000 hectares. It is even more widespread in Australia, where it covers 600,000 hectares and is also considered a noxious weed. The plant often outcompetes native vegetation, forming dense fields where other species are almost completely crowded out. Stands of French broom can be so thick that they make meadows and pastures useless for wild and domestic animals. Other harmful effects include its ability to shade out tree seedlings in reforested areas, its tendency to catch fire, and the toxicity of its leaves and seeds, which contain alkaloids poisonous to many large domestic animals. ==See also== *Broom ==References * *USDA Genista monspessulana - French Broom Information Page *French Broom Webpage from the Calflora.org website; the webpage gives links to additional photos.

The quartet has appeared since 2002 in advertising and personal appearances. There have been five different Fantanas rosters, the latter reintroduced as a co-ed dance ensemble in 2017. Their jingle is \\"Wanna Fanta! Don't you wanna?\\". ==The \\"story\\" behind the Fantanas== According to the Fantanas's website, they lived on Fantana Island and were accidentally discovered by an entertainment mogul named Sir Juan-Carlos Martinez III after he fell off his yacht and was washed ashore on that island, seeing their work. He later talked with an advertising mogul, Paul Gurbel, in a fictional New York City restaurant who brought them to the United States. In actuality, the advertisements were created by Ogilvy and Mather in 2002. ==IncarnationsOriginal Fantanas (2002‚Äì2004)=== The original roster of Fantanas sported an island/party style. The members (with their real names) were: *Nina (K.D. Aubert) - red (strawberry Fanta) *Calli (Jennifer Diaz) - orange (orange Fanta) *Leelee (Adrienne Janic) - yellow (pineapple Fanta) *Raquel (Andrea De Oliveira) - purple (grape Fanta) They gained attention outside their advertisements for their campiness and use of sexuality, and these original four were featured in a Maxim magazine spread in December 2002. ===\\"Mod\\" Fantanas (2004‚Äì2006)=== In 2004, the Fantanas returned with a new look inspired by the mod fashion styles of the late 1960s. The members (some real names being withheld or not known) were: *Capri (Katerina Graham) - red (strawberry Fanta) *Kiki - orange (orange Fanta); leader *Lola - yellow (pineapple Fanta) *Sophia (Monica Flores) - purple (grape Fanta) ===\\"Party\\" Fantanas (2006‚Äì2009)=== Third incarnation of the Fantanas, introduced in 2006. In 2006, the next-generation roster of Fantanas was introduced, this time with a contemporary party look. The commercials featuring this Fantanas roster were filmed in Argentina.http://www.specialeventsite.com/IndustryInfo/Articles/view.php3?ID=4672&area;=Equipment+Wire The members (real names being withheld or not known) are: *Kaia (Danielle Acoff) - red (strawberry Fanta) *Amie (Dena Cali) - orange (orange Fanta); leader.On the Fanta website, Aime's signature reads \\"Amie\\".

Each of the Fantanas would have an individual fashion style. This roster of the Fantanas had these members (some real names being withheld or not known): *Summer (Diana Carr) - orange; indie, organic hippie style, leader. *Melody (Katherine Wilkes) - purple (grape Fanta); musical, punk, rockstar style.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG4I-2rtX6I , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1atdIPQvJiI , Also starred in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pxsjWapuHA *Isabela (Marilinda Rivera) - red (strawberry Fanta); fashionable, sexy, chic style. *Lily (Brittany Hampton) - yellow (pineapple Fanta); cute, chic style.

Both appearances (Episodes #1004 and #1009, aired 6 November and 18 December 2004, respectively) starred Daniele Gaither as Capri, Stephnie Weir as Lola, Nicole Parker as Kiki, and Paul C. Vogt as \\"Two-Liter\\" Beth. The commercials were similar to the actual Fantanas commercials, with Capri, Lola and Kiki offering Fanta to a series of men, only to be interrupted by Beth's attempts to seduce the men with her two-liter bottle of an odd savory flavored Fanta (and some blurred nudity).

Platform level at Surrey Central Surrey Central is an elevated station on the Expo Line of Metro Vancouver's SkyTrain rapid transit system. The station is located in the Whalley / City Centre district of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, just east of the North Surrey Recreation Centre. The station is within walking distance of the Central City shopping centre, Surrey City Hall, and SFU Surrey, the Surrey campus of Simon Fraser University. ==History== Surrey Central station was opened in 1994 along with two other stations when the Expo Line was extended from Scott Road station farther into Whalley, to the \\"Surrey City Centre\\" district. Prior to the opening of the station, there was a bus loop on the site known as \\"Whalley Exchange\\", which opened in 1975. The station was briefly known as \\"Whalley Central\\" during planning; however, the name \\"Surrey Central\\" was chosen after an ad was placed in the local paper calling on residents to propose an appropriate name. Over the years, the station has earned a reputation for being unsafe and a magnet for crime, including violence and drug trafficking. In 2009, it had the second-highest number of violent crimes in the SkyTrain system (with Commercial‚ÄìBroadway station having the highest). In an effort to combat the station's rundown image, and to show off experimental urban design, the City of Surrey and TransLink agreed to have Surrey Central station participate in the GVTA's Urban Transit Village program. The Transit Villages were defined by TransLink as \\"a new approach to station design and access.\\" While the original schedule called for construction to be completed by the second quarter of 2007, nothing beyond design plans were completed. The Surrey Central plan specifically called for improvements in four areas: station access, street design, King George Boulevard, and land use. Officers from the Metro Vancouver Transit Police can be found patrolling the bus loop and SkyTrain platform in an effort to reduce crime and disorder, with supplemental volunteers patrolling the area and reporting any suspicious or dangerous behaviour. By the mid-2010s, with extensive police patrols and redevelopment of the area, violent crimes shifted from Whalley south to Newton, which has taken over the area's reputation of being the most dangerous part of Surrey. In March 2017, station upgrades started on Surrey Central station to create two new entrances on the north side of the station at Central Avenue and City Parkway to reduce congestion. Accessibility and lighting was also improved with three additional escalators and an elevator. Construction work was completed in February 2019, and the new stationhouse opened to the public in March 2019. ==Services== Surrey Central station is a transfer point for several bus routes that serve various areas of Surrey, White Rock, North Delta and Langley. ==Station informationStation layout=Entrances=== Lower concourse of Surrey Central's north stationhouse * North stationhouse : located at the corner of Central Avenue and City Parkway, the stationhouse provides access to Surrey City Centre Public Library, Surrey City Hall and the Kwantlen Polytechnic University Civic Plaza campus.

It is a perennial plant that grows in wet places such as marshes, stream banks, slough margins, ditches, meadows, and wet pastures. The roots are thick and tuberous, with many smaller tubers on the main tuber, allowing survival in wet conditions. Water hemlock is most abundant in British Columbia, and is indigenous to North America, where it grows primarily from the base of the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific coast, stretching from Alaska all the way to California. Water requirements limit this plant from inhabiting open rangelands. Characteristics of water hemlock include its stem, which is 0.5‚Äì2 meters tall with purplish spots, thick roots, and alternate leaves that are compound pinnate. The leaflets are usually 5‚Äì8 cm long and 1‚Äì2 cm wide, with jagged edges. Its inflorescences are compound umbellate with many small, white flowers. There are two seeds per flower. Seed dispersal is by means of wind, water, machinery, clothing, and through transported soil. The seeds germinate in spring, and flowers mature near the end of June and beginning of July. In addition to sprouting new plants from seeds, rootstocks can also produce new plants in the fall from the basal meristem. When these detach the following spring, they may form a new plant. ==Toxicity== The main distinguishing characteristic of western water hemlock is its toxicity. Cicutoxin is the toxin that is produced, making water hemlock the most poisonous plant in North America. Cicutoxin is a yellowish liquid that is prevalent in the roots. This unsaturated alcohol has a major impact on the central nervous system of animals. Early symptoms of cicutoxin poisoning include excessive salivation, frothing at the mouth, nervousness, and incoordination. These symptoms can progress to tremors, muscular weakness, seizures and respiratory failure. Ingestion of green materials of western water hemlock in amounts equivalent to about 0.1% of a person's body weight can even lead to death. In addition to being extremely hazardous to humans, this plant has an enormous impact on animals. As little as 0.2‚Äì0.5% body weight for sheep, 0.1% body weight for cattle, 0.5% body weight for horses, and 0.3% body weight for swine can be lethal. Death can occur within fifteen minutes of ingesting the toxin. It is one of the first plants to emerge in springtime, and has a very appealing odor. These characteristics, along with the fact that it grows in moist areas, make the plant very attractive, but deadly, to grazing animals. ==References * Calflora Database: Cicuta douglasii (Western water hemlock) * Jepson eFlora (TJM2) treatment of Cicuta douglasii * U.C.

It was written by Leor Zolman and first released in 1979 when he was 20 years old. \\"BDS\\" stands for \\"Brain Damage Software.\\" BDS C was popular and influential among CP/M users and developers in the 8-bit microcomputer era. It ran much faster and was more convenient to use than other Z80-hosted compilers of the time. It was possible to run BDS C on single-floppy machines with as little as 30K of RAM in comparison to most other commercial compilers which required many passes and the writing of intermediate files to disk. Around 75,000 copies were sold, including a stripped down Japanese incarnation. A number of important commercial CP/M products were written in the BDS C subset (no long integer, no floating-point arithmetic) of the C language, including PeachText from PeachTree Software, MINCE and Scribble from Mark of the Unicorn, and most of the software in the Perfect Software suite including Perfect Writer, PerfectCalc, PerfectSpeller and PerfectFiler (which suite was bundled with the Kaypro). Weak points of BDS C were that the floating point math routines and the file access functions were incompatible with the Unix C compiler's and its relocatable object files were not compatible with the Microsoft assembler, making it more difficult to integrate C code with assembly language. BDS C was bundled with a subset of the Unix system written in about 1980, called MARC (Machine Assisted Resource Coordinator). This effort in some ways resembled GNU, though MARC was to be able to run CP/M software through emulation. Unfortunately MARC's author, Ed Ziemba, perished in a snorkeling accident before he could complete the project.InfoWorld (17 Aug 1981) In 2002, Leor Zolman released the 8080 assembly language source code for BDS C into the public domain. ==See also== *Small-C ==References *BD Software download page *MUF Mastery - historical note about Leor Zolman and BDS C *Interview with Leor Zolman *BDS C Users Group Category:1979 software Category:C (programming language) compilers Category:CP/M software Category:Free compilers and interpreters Category:Formerly proprietary software Category:Public-domain software with source code Category:Assembly language software ","title":"BDS C"},{"id":"2230130","text":"Light court and main stairs, University of Munich (1906-09) Altes Stadthaus in Bonn (1922) German Bestelmeyer (8 June 1874 - 30 June 1942) was a German architect, university lecturer, and proponent of Nazi architecture. Most of his work was in South Germany. ==Life and career== Bestelmeyer was born in Nuremberg, the son of a military doctor. He studied architecture from 1893 to 1897 at the Technical University of Munich under Friedrich von Thiersch and at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna under Friedrich von Schmidt. He then worked as a building inspector and planner in Nuremberg, Regensburg, and at the University of Munich, where he designed an extension to the main building that was built in 1906-10\\\\. In 1910 he was appointed to a professorship at the Technical University of Dresden; the following year he transferred to the Academy of Fine Arts, and in 1915 to the Academy of Fine Arts Berlin. In 1919 he also became a professor at the Technical University of Berlin- Charlottenburg. In 1922 he returned to Munich as a professor at the Technical University, and from 1934 until his death in 1942 he was President of the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts. Bestelmeyer was an outspoken advocate of traditionalist, v√∂lkisch architecture. He was a member of the Munich School to which Paul Troost also belonged. In 1928, with Paul Schultze-Naumburg, Paul Schmitthenner and others, he founded \\"The Block\\", a group of architects in opposition to the modernist group The Ring.Robert R.

He was singled out for praise in 1931 by Schultze-Naumburg and in 1934, after the Nazis came to power, wrote an article in which he endorsed Alexander von Senger's criticism of Le Corbusier, described 1920s architecture as having become \\"soulless\\", and rejected flat roofs as unsuited to the climate in Germany. He was a member of both the Werkbund and the antisemitic Militant League for German Culture.Ernst Klee, Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich.

He brought von Senger to the Bavarian Academy and designed buildings such as the Luftwaffe office building on the Prinzregentenstra√üe, which were much praised at the time.Taylor, pp. 113-14. However, he also designed a number of mostly Protestant churches, some of which met with official approval,Taylor, p. 209. and Hitler chose his design for the Mangfall Bridge, a girder bridge on two massive concrete pylons carrying one of the new autobahns, which was influential in its simple modernity and size.Richard Vahrenkamp, \\"Der Autobahnbau 1933 bis 1943 und das hessische Autobahnnetz\\", Arbeitspapier zur Logistik 36/2001, University of Kassel, Zeitschrift des Vereins f√ºr hessische Geschichte und Landeskunde 104 (2004) 225‚Äì66, revision of August 2005 in pdf , p. 4, note 5 Rainer Stommer, \\"Triumph der Technik: Autobahnbr√ºcken zwischen Ingenieuraufgabe und Kulturdenkmal\\", in: Reichsautobahn: Pyramiden des Dritten Reichs.

In 1931, Senger, along with other Nazi architects such as Eugen Honig, Konrad Nonn, German Bestelmeyer, and especially Paul Schultze-Naumburg were deputized in the Nazi campaign against modern architecture, in a para-governmental propaganda unit called the Kampfbund deutscher Architekten und Ingenieure (KDAI). Through the pages of the official Nazi newspaper, the People's Observer (V√∂lkischer Beobachter), these architects actively attacked the modern style in openly racist and political tones. They placed much of the blame on members of the architectural group \\"The Ring,\\" calling Walter Gropius an \\"elegant salon-bolshevist\\", and calling the Bauhaus \\"the cathedral of Marxism\\". These political connections helped Senger into a professorship at the Technical Hochschule in Munich when increasing political pressure forced out architect Robert Vorhoelzer, who had made the cultural error of modernism in several Bavarian post offices. ==External links== * A history of the Altbau, including the \\"intense and turbulent\\" construction phase Category:1880 births Category:1968 deaths Category:People from Geneva Category:Architects in the Nazi Party Category:19th-century German architects Category:20th-century German architects Category:Swiss architects Category:Nazi Party politicians Category:Militant League for German Culture members ","title":"Alexander von Senger"},{"id":"2230154","text":"The Monastery of Christ in the Desert is a Roman Catholic Benedictine monastery belonging to the English Province of the Subiaco Congregation of Benedictine monasteries. The monastery is in Abiquiu, New Mexico, surrounded by miles of undisturbed wilderness amidst the Chama River Canyon Wilderness area 75 miles north of Santa Fe. It is accessible by Forest Road 151, a 13-mile dirt road off of US route 84. The monastery was founded in 1964 by Aelred Wall, O.S.B., a monk of Mount Savior Monastery in Pine City, New York. The original monastery was designed by George Nakashima. The chapel was praised by Thomas Merton as the most perfect monastic chapel he had ever visited. Christ in the Desert follows the Benedictine life without an external apostolate. It has a guesthouse in which men and women can stay and join the monks in the chapel to share in the monastic Divine Office and in the Mass. In addition to maintaining the guesthouse, the monks manage a gift shop of books and religious items, which is accessible online and by mail order. The monks also work in agriculture, crafts, computer work and maintenance of the grounds and facilities. Christ in the Desert has three dependent monasteries. Two are in Mexico (Nuestra Senora de la Soledad and Monasterio Benedictino De Santa Mar√≠a y Todos Los Santos) and the other is in Kerens, Texas (Benedictine Monastery of Thien Tam). These monasteries also observe the Benedictine life with no apostolate other than a guesthouse. The monastery maintains one of the largest private solar power systems in the US, which provides its only source of electricity. The monastery comprises men from many nations. English is the common language of the house. == TLC documentary == In 2006 the monastery was the setting for a TLC documentary program entitled The Monastery. The documentary was produced by Tiger Aspect of the UK for the TLC cable network in the US. The series followed the experiences of five laymen who lived in the monastery and observed the monastic way of life for forty days. The series was filmed in early 2006 and was originally broadcast in five episodes in the US on the TLC network in Oct-Nov 2006. == Internet pioneers == In 1995 the monastery published a website, www.christdesert.org, that became one of the world's most visited websites in the years 1995-1997. The monastery and their web scriptorium was covered in feature stories distributed via the Associated Press wire (in 1995) and The New York Times wire (in 1996). Print coverage included page one of The New York Times Sunday edition, a full color double page spread in USA Today, and the lead in a cover story in Time. Television feature stories ran on CNN International, CBS Sunday Morning, ABC World News Tonight and Brazil's Fant√°stico. The monastery's web scriptorium led to the foundation of an independent research project called NextScribe. NextScribe conducts research in Computer Supported Spiritual Development (CSSD) with a particular emphasis on remaking lay spiritual community according to the wisdom of the tradition of St. Benedict. ==Brewing== The Monastery of Christ in the Desert has operated a small brewery, Abbey Brewing Company, since 2005. As of 2012 it is the only monastery-run brewery in the United States. The brewery produces three beers: Monks' Ale, Monks' Wit, and Monks' Tripel. The beers are currently brewed by Abbey Brewing using facilities at Sierra Blanca Brewing Company in Moriarty, with an experimental brewery located at the monastery.

He joined the NSDAP in 1930 and was an important advocate of Nazi architecture and a leading critic of modern architecture. ==Life== Schultze-Naumburg was born in Almrich (now part of Naumburg) in the current federal state of Saxony-Anhalt, and by 1900 was a well-known painter and architect, first emerging as a more- conservative member of the group of artists who established the Jugendstil and the Arts and Crafts workshops in Munich. His series of books the Kulturarbeiten (\\"Works of Culture\\"), nine volumes published 1900‚Äì1917, were extremely popular and established him as a major tastemaker for the German middle class. By the First World War, he had become a major proponent of traditional architecture, an originator of the \\"Circa 1800\\" movement, and an important voice in both the Deutscher Werkbund and the nationalist German architecture and landscape preservation movement. A well-known example of his architecture from this time is the Cecilienhof Palace in Potsdam, built by order of Wilhelm II for his son, crown prince Wilhelm in 1914‚Äì1917. On 5 January 1922 Paul Schultze-Naumburg married in Saaleck Margarete Karolina Berta D√∂rr (1896‚Äì1960). They were childless and divorced nastily on 7 February 1934. A couple of weeks later Margarete married the Reich Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick.\\"Familie Paul Schultze-Naumburg‚Äú In response to the defeat of the First World War and of his own marginalization in the interwar architectural discourse, Schultze-Naumburg's articles and books began to take on a far harsher and less progressive character, condemning modern art and architecture in racial terms, thereby providing much of the basis for Adolf Hitler's theories in which classical Greece and the Middle Ages were the true sources of Aryan art.Adam, pp. 29‚Äì32 Schultze-Naumburg wrote such books as Die Kunst der Deutschen. Ihr Wesen und ihre Werke (\\"The Art of the Germans. Its Nature and Its Works\\") and Kunst und Rasse (\\"Art and Race\\"), the latter published in 1928, in which he argued that only \\"racially pure\\" artists could produce a healthy art which upheld timeless ideals of classical beauty, while racially \\"mixed\\" modern artists showed their inferiority and corruption by producing distorted artwork. As evidence of this, he reproduced examples of modern art next to photographs of people with deformities and diseases, graphically reinforcing the idea of modernism as a sickness.Grosshans, p. 9 Along with Alexander von Senger, Eugen Honig, Konrad Nonn, and German Bestelmeyer, Schultze-Naumburg was a member of a Nazi para-governmental propaganda unit called the Kampfbund deutscher Architekten und Ingenieure (KDAI). In September 1944, he was named as one of the first rank of artists and writers important to Nazi culture in the Gottbegnadeten list. Schultze- Naumburg died in Jena in 1949. His ashes were placed in the mausoleum designed by him in 1909 for the poet Ernst von Wildenbruch in Weimar Historical Cemetery. ==Selected projects== Schloss Freudenberg in Wiesbaden von S√ºden.jpgSchloss Freudenberg in Wiesbaden Klingenpfad (7th stage)(V-16).jpgSchloss Hackhausen in Solingen File:Schloss Bahrendorf.JPGSchloss Bahrendorf in S√ºlzetal File:Berlin-Kladow Gutshaus Neukladow (1).JPGGuest house in Kladow Grabow manor.jpgManor in Grabow Seestra√üe 43 Potsdam.jpgCountry home in Potsdam == See also == * Ester Claesson == Bibliography == * Jose-Manuel GARC√çA ROIG, \\"Tres arquitectos del periodo guillermino.

He is one of the founders and main political figures on the Workers Party of Brazil (PT). In the municipal elections of S√£o Paulo in 2016 was consecrated as the most voted city councilor in the history of Brazil. ==Biography== Son of coffee grower Paulo Cochrane Suplicy and Filomena Matarazzo, he is an heir of the well-known coffee company Suplicy Caf√©s, besides belonging to the traditional Italian Brazilian Matarazzo family. His mother is a granddaughter of Francesco Matarazzo, known for having created the largest industrial complex in Latin America in the early 20th century. Suplicy has a degree in business management from the Funda√ß√£o Get√∫lio Vargas' School of Business Administration, where he is currently a professor, and a degree in economics from Michigan State University. On 1964, Suplicy married Marta Teresa Smith de Vasconcelos, better known as Marta Suplicy, and had three sons with her: Jo√£o, Andr√©, and Eduardo. They were one of the most famous couples of Brazilian politics until their divorce in 2001. Currently, Eduardo has a new partner, journalist Monica Dallari. In 1966, he became professor of the Economics Department of the School of Business Administration of the Funda√ß√£o Get√∫lio Vargas in S√£o Paulo, where he still works until today. In 1968, he obtained his master's degree at the Michigan State University. In 1973, Suplicy concluded his PhD at Michigan State University with the thesis \\"The Effects of Mini devaluation in the Brazilian Economy\\", published in 1975 by the Funda√ß√£o Get√∫lio Vargas. He later did a post-doctorate at Stanford University. Eduardo Suplicy is the author of \\"The Effect of Mini devaluations in the Brazilian Economy\\" (Published by Funda√ß√£o Get√∫lio Vargas - 1975); \\"International and Brazilian Economic Policies\\" (Published by Vozes ed. - 1977); \\"Commitment\\" (Published by Editora Brasiliense - 1978); \\"Investigating the Coroa-Brastel Case\\" (edited by the House of Representatives - 1985); \\"From the Distribution of Income to the Rights of Citizenship\\" (published by Editora Brasiliense - 1988) and \\"The Program of Guaranteed Minimum Income\\" (edited by the Federal Senate - 1992). On the second of February 2016, he is made doctor honoris causa from the University of Louvain (UCLouvain). ==Political career== Suplicy managed to be first elected senator in the history of the Brazilian Labour Party (PT). His political performance is the result of a public life constructed throughout almost 20 years, when he was elected for his first mandate as State Deputy (1979/1983). He is one of the founders of Workers Party of Brazil (PT) and member of the Executive and the National Directory of the Party. Elected Senator of the Republic for the mandate 1991/99, with 4,229,706 votes, Eduardo Suplicy occupied the position of leader of PT in the Federal Senate for three times. Since 1991, Suplicy acts as a Senator for the state of S√£o Paulo. That year, he became the first member of the Workers' Party to take office as Senator. In the 1998 elections for the Federal Senate, Eduardo Suplicy conquered the biggest poll for this position in the Country and the second greatest of the history of S√£o Paulo, with 6,718,463 votes. == Political agenda == One of the most important Bill of Law presented by Suplicy institutes in Brazil the Program of Guaranteed Basic Income. Approved in the Senate in December 1991, it waited for seven years to be voted in the Commission of Finances and Taxation of the House of Representatives. Suplicy also presented Bills of Law requiring the knowledgement of the main debtors to the Federal Budget, to the Labour Ministry, to the Social Security and Federal Government Saving Bank; creating the structure of the National Co-operative Society System; granting amnesty to the labor union representatives due to political motivations; instituting direct elections for substitutes of candidates to the Federal Senate and authorizing the Executive Power to create the Brazilian Citizenship Fund, among others. To fulfill his campaign promises, Suplicy tried to present a proposition to reduce the senators‚Äô mandate for four years. == See also == * Basic income in Brazil ==External links== *Curriculum Vitae in English == Citations == Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Federal Senate Category:Brazilian people of Italian descent Category:Brazilian people of French descent Category:People from S√£o Paulo Category:Michigan State University alumni Category:Funda√ß√£o Getulio Vargas faculty Category:Workers' Party (Brazil) politicians Category:Brazilian Democratic Movement politicians Category:Universal basic income activists Category:Members of the Legislative Assembly of S√£o Paulo Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Brazil) from S√£o Paulo Category:Funda√ß√£o Getulio Vargas alumni ","title":"Eduardo Suplicy"},{"id":"2230196","text":"Founded in 1914, the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC) is an American trade association advocating an open, rules-based international trade system.

At the time large parts of the Australian coast were unmapped and Britain had claimed only part of the continent. The British Government were concerned that, in the event of settlers of another European power becoming established in Australia, any future conflict in Europe would lead to a widening of the conflict into the southern hemisphere to the detriment of the trade that Britain sought to develop. It was against this background that Lady Nelson was chosen to survey and establish sovereignty over strategic parts of the continent. Lady Nelson left Portsmouth on 18 March 1800 and arrived at Sydney on 16 December 1800 after having been the first vessel to reach the east coast of Australia via Bass Strait. Prior to that date all vessels had sailed around the southern tip of Tasmania to reach their destination. Lady Nelsons survey work commenced shortly after her arrival at Sydney, initially in the Bass Strait area. She was involved in the discovery of Port Phillip, on the coast of Victoria, in establishing settlements on the River Derwent and at Port Dalrymple in Tasmania, at Newcastle and Port Macquarie in New South Wales, and on Melville Island off the north coast of the continent. == Design, building and commissioning == At the end of the 1790s the New South Wales Colonial Government had no vessels capable of reaching the outside world. Supply (1793) was found to be unseaworthy in 1797 and was subsequently condemned. was also unseaworthy. Reliance was temporarily repaired to enable her to sail back to England, whither she departed in March 1800. The only other vessel under the control of the colonial government was , a schooner of only 44 tons (bm). The situation was partially relieved when arrived in May 1799, but the colony possessed no vessels for exploration and surveying. In 1799 the Admiralty's Commissioners of Transport (the Transport Board), ordered a cutter of 60 tons (bm), to be built for their own use in the River Thames and called it Lady Nelson. Her design followed that of the armed cutter Trial, built in Plymouth in 1789 to a design developed by Captain (later Admiral) John Schanck [often spelled Schank]. Trial was unusual in that she had three sliding keels, or centre-boards, that the crew could raise or lower individually. At the time there were several other vessels named Lady Nelson and this has led some authors to write that the vessel, which is the subject of this article, was employed on other duties before being sent to Australia. Philip Gidley King, who was in England in 1799, was aware of the lack of vessels in New South Wales, and lobbied for Lady Nelson to be taken over for use in the Colony. The cost to the government was said to be ¬£890.Philip Gidley King (King) to Sir Joseph Banks (Banks), 20 Mar. 1799, ML Banks Papers, Series 39.043. He personally inspected the vessel on 8 October 1799, whilst it was being fitted-out at Deptford, and suggested that: > as few seamen know anything about the management of a cutter, her being > constructed into a brig would make her more manageable to the generality of > seamen. Schanck agreed with this change and the Commissioners of Transport were directed to rig the vessel as a brig, and not as a cutter like the Trial as had been intended.King to John King, Under Secretary of State for the Home Department, 8 Oct 1799, HRNSW, Vol. III, p. 724.

The ability to raise the keels was a useful feature for a survey vessel required to work in shallow waters. Lady Nelsons draught was 12 feet when she left England, fully provisioned for her voyage. This would draught would halve to six feet when the keels were raised. The keels were of timber construction with no added ballast. Lady Nelson was built by John Dudman in the dockyard, known as Deadman's Dock, at Grove Street, Deptford. Lady Nelsons first commander was Lieutenant James Grant, the commission of whom came into effect on 19 October 1799.Grant to King, 17 Feb. 1801, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. III, pp. 81‚Äì82.

I, Vol. II, pp. 498‚Äì501. Philip Gidley King departed for New South Wales in Speedy on 26 Nov 1799 with a despatch recalling the incumbent Governor, John Hunter, who returned to England. King then took over as Governor and subsequently played a key part in the affairs of Lady Nelson after she arrived. ==The voyage to Australia== Lady Nelson was loaded with sufficient provisions for nine months and enough water for six months, at an allowance of one gallon for each man per day. She was not equipped with a chronometer. The beginning of the voyage to Australia was recorded by Grant: > On 13 January 1800, the Lady Nelson hauled out of Deadman's Dock into the > River, having her complement of men, stores, and provisions on board. Lady Nelson reached Gravesend on 16 January, anchored in the Downs on 20 January 1800. After riding out a heavy gale Grant decided to seek shelter in Ramsgate Harbour. Lady Nelson remained there until 7 February, when she sailed for Portsmouth to await a convoy to escort her past the French and Spanish coasts. Whilst at Portsmouth Lady Nelsons armament, consisting of two brass carriage guns, was increased to six. On 15 March 1800, Captain Schanck, accompanied by Mr. Bayley, of the Royal Academy, Portsmouth, paid Grant a visit. Many people who saw Lady Nelson did not consider her suitable to undertake such a long voyage and this caused Grant some difficulty in keeping his crew together and finding replacements for those that deserted. The carpenter, who had deserted when leaving Portsmouth, and one other member of the crew were not replaced and one man was put ashore due to illness. When Lady Nelson sailed her complement was probably therefore only three officers and ten crew. Lady Nelson departed from Dunnose, Isle of Wight, at 6 pm on 18 March.For the departure date see Steel, Jun. 1800; Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, p. 238; and Grant 1803, p. 4.The convoy consisted of East Indiamen, heading for the East, and , which was also bound for New South Wales. Shortly after departure it became apparent that Lady Nelson could not keep up with the larger and faster vessels in the convoy. Brunswick therefore took Lady Nelson in tow, but Grant became concerned that the vessel might be strained too much in the heavy seas and therefore, after a couple of days, ordered the hawser to be cast off, preferring to continue the voyage alone. On 13 April Lady Nelson anchored at Port Praya (Praia), on the island of 'St Jago' (Ilha de Santiago), the largest of the Cape Verde Islands, 26 days after leaving Portsmouth. Whilst there, the keels were inspected and it was found that part of the after keel had broken off, which may have occurred during earlier heavy weather. The missing part of the keel was replaced, a task not made any easier by the lack of a carpenter on board. Before leaving, Grant put his second mate ashore for sowing seeds of discontent amongst the crew, and obtained the Governor's permission to take two young men from the island to supplement his crew. Lady Nelson left Praia on 27 April. The vessel's complement was now three officers and twelve crew. On 23 May, the weather being fine, Lady Nelsons keels were examined and it was found that the piece that had been fitted to the bottom of the after keel at Praia had broken off. A temporary repair was effected by pushing the keel deeper into the well, and securing it with a plank of wood. Land was sighted near Table Bay at 5 am on 7 June and Lady Nelson anchored there at 5 pm on 8 June 1800. A shipbuilder from the naval dockyard examined Lady Nelson and as her main and after keels were both found to be beyond repair they were replaced with new ones. Lady Nelson had been troubled by leaks in her topsides since she left England. This was also investigated whilst the vessel was at the Cape, and it was found 'that instead of the seams being filled with oakum they had absolutely substituted putty'.Memorial of Lieut. James Grant, commanding H. M. brig Lady Nelson, to His Excellency Governor King, Sydney Cove, Tuesday, 16 December 1800, HRNSW, Vol. IV, pp. 268‚Äì270 and HRA, Ser. I, Vol. III, pp. 60‚Äì62. Two new keels having been fitted, Lady Nelson left Table Bay on 16 June and anchored in Simon's Bay the next day. Already anchored there was Porpoise, which had left Portsmouth in the same convoy as Lady Nelson. Grant's orders were 'to remain at the Cape till the summer season commenced' so as not to risk his small vessel in the Roaring Forties during the southern hemisphere winter. Grant therefore spent many weeks at the Cape and the observations he made during the period are recorded in his book (Grant 1803). Whilst at the Cape, Grant received a despatch from London in which he was advised that a navigable strait had recently been discovered between New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania), in latitude 38¬∞ south, and the despatch instructed him to: > sail through the said strait on your way to Port Jackson, by which means you > will not only shorten your voyage, but will have an opportunity of more > minutely surveying the said strait. Portland to Grant, 8 Apr. 1800, TNA CO > 202/5, AJCP PRO 56 and HRA, Ser. I, Vol. II, p. 501. Before leaving the Cape, Grant took on board a carpenter and a person named Dr. Brandt. Grant also consented to take on board a Danish seaman, thought to be Jorgen Jorgenson, sentenced at the Cape to transportation, for his involvement in mutinous behaviour on board a recently arrived ship. Lady Nelson left the Cape on 7 October 1800. ==The first passage through Bass Strait== The south coast of what was then called New Holland was not sighted until Lady Nelson approached the land near the present border between South Australia and Victoria. Grant recorded first sighting the mainland on 3 December 1800: > At 8.00 am I saw the land from the north training as far to the east as > east-north-east. The part that was right ahead appearing like unconnected > islands, being four in number, distant six or seven leagues. At noon I > observed, being in with the land, our latitude to be 38¬∞ 10' S. longitude, > by account, 142¬∞ 30' E. which according to my best judgement, after looking > over my reckoning, I allowed the western point of land Cape Banks to lay in > 142¬∞ E. From the distance I was from the shore, and observing in 38¬∞ 10', I > make Cape Banks to lie in 38¬∞ 4' S. Grant observed two capes and two high mountains a considerable way inshore. Grant named the first of these mountains after Captain Schanck (since renamed Mount Schank), and the other Gambier's Mountain. The western cape he called Cape Banks and the second, eastern cape, he called Cape Northumberland. The actual position of Cape Banks is longitude . The discrepancy in longitude would have resulted, at least in part, by the absence of a chronometer on Lady Nelson. During the succeeding days, as Lady Nelson approached Bass Strait, Grant made numerous observations and named several geographic features along the southern coast of the continent. Lady Nelson entered Bass Strait itself on 7 December when Grant sighted a cape that he named Cape Albany Otway (now Cape Otway). He named another cape, eight or ten nautical miles East-North-East- half East, Patton's Cape (now Cape Patton). A large bay, now appearing to the east, he named Portland Bay. On 8 December Lady Nelson sailed across a large bay, which was found to extend from Cape Otway in the west to Wilsons Promontory in the east, a distance of 120 nautical miles. Grant named this large extent of water Governor King's Bay, but the name has not survived. The discovery of Port Phillip, at the head of this bay, the bottom of which could not be seen from the mast-head, was still many months into the future. As the coast between Wilsons Promontory and Port Jackson had already examined by Bass and Flinders, Grant did not conduct any further surveys and headed for Port Jackson, anchoring in Sydney Cove at 7.30 pm on 16 December 1800 after a voyage of 71 days from the Cape of Good Hope. The agreements entered into between the Transport Board and the crew of Lady Nelson terminated on arrival of the vessel in Port Jackson and accordingly the crew were paid off.King to Grant, 27 Dec. 1800, HRNSW, Vol. IV, p. 275. King had not received any directions on whether the vessel was to be considered on the establishment of the Navy, the Transport Board, or the Colony, and it was many months before this administrative matter was resolved. Before Grant left England he had received an appointment as Lieutenant to , which was to come into effect on his arrival at Port Jackson, but when he arrived he found Supply had been condemned as unfit to proceed to sea. Grant: 'was therefore, to make use of a sailor's phrase, completely adrift.' ==Exploration of Bass Strait by Grant== Lady Nelson carried despatches to the Governor of New South Wales that included instructions on her future deployment. The instructions indicated that 'The survey of the southern or south-western coast of the country appears to be of the most immediate importance'. The Governor, now Philip Gidley King, therefore had to find a commander and a new crew to carry out these instructions. As there was no other naval officer in the colony, command of Lady Nelson was offered to Grant (then unemployed), which he accepted.Warrant of Appointment to Lieutenant Grant, Sydney, 1 Jan. 1801, TNA CO 201/19, AJCP PRO 9, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. III, p. 66, and Grant 1803, pp. 84‚Äì85. John Murray, Second Mate of Porpoise, transferred to Lady Nelson as First Mate.King to Wm. Scott, Acting Commander of the Porpoise, 10 Feb. 1801, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. III, p. 81 (Attachment I of King to Nepean 10 Mar. 1801). As the crew could only be given naval pay, and not the very high wages paid by the Transport Board during the delivery voyage, only two of the crew that had sailed Lady Nelson from England were prepared re-join the vessel. King therefore had to recruit a convict crew. This he did by granting conditional emancipations to some of the best behaved of the seamen among the convicts to enable them to serve on board the vessel and to receive the pay given in the Navy. The naval complement of the vessel was therefore:Enclosure D of King to Nepean, 10 Mar 1801, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. III, p. 78. {  style=\\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\\" - ! Position !!

I, Vol. III, pp. 62‚Äì66. Four Privates of the New South Wales Corps were placed on board as a guard and Ensign Francis Barrallier, also of the New South Wales Corps, joined as surveyor for the expedition. The expedition was joined by George Caley, a botanist sent by Sir Joseph Banks to collect plants, John Lewin, naturalist and artist, and an aborigine named Euranabie and his wife WoroganThe Lady Nelson was to be accompanied by the sloop Bee to act as a tender. The two vessels left Sydney Cove on 6 March 1801 but encountered heavy weather soon after their departure. Bee shipped a lot of water and was obliged to return to Port Jackson. Lady Nelson continued south alone and, after spending two days in Jervis Bay, passed Cape Howe on the 15th, Wilsons Promontory on the 20th, and sighted Western Port on 21 March. Lady Nelson had arrived off the island that forms the south head of Western Port and from its likeness to a snapper's head, Grant named it Snapper Island, since renamed Phillip Island. The greater part of the survey of Western Port was completed by 22 April but bad weather prevented Lady Nelson from leaving until 29 April. Grant noted: > Western Port is capable of containing several hundred sail of ships with > perfect security from storms, and will admit of being fortified. Lady Nelson then headed east with the intention of surveying the coast between Western Port and Wilsons Promontory but the weather prevented them from remaining constantly near the coast and Grant therefore decided to return to Port Jackson. Further bad weather was encountered and, after sheltering in Botany Bay for 24 hours, Lady Nelson arrived back at Port Jackson on 14 May 1801. Grant later wrote: > the unfavourableness of the weather prevented me from completing the whole > of my instructions ... It is true that the winter season of that climate was > fast approaching; and instead of exploring to the southward we ought to have > gone to the northward, by which means we should avoid many tempestuous > gales. After a brief stay in Port Jackson Lady Nelson was sent to explore and survey the Coal River to the north of Port Jackson. The Coal River was later renamed Hunter River and is now the site of the City of Newcastle. Lady Nelson was accompanied by the colonial schooner Francis. The two vessels left Port Jackson on 10 June 1801. Francis returned to Port Jackson on 26 June and the exploration party remained until 22 July 1801 when they departed for Port Jackson, arriving there on 25 July 1801.Grant 1803, 149‚Äì66.

I, Vol. III, p. 273, and King to Grant, 1 Sep. 1801, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. III, pp. 273‚Äì274. Grant's last voyage on Lady Nelson was to the Hawkesbury to load grain produced by local settlers, and transport it to Port Jackson.Lee 1915, p. 78. Grant returned to England on the brig Anna Josepha, which departed on 9 Nov. 1801.Grant 1803, p. 174. Grant was replaced by John Murray, Lady Nelsons mate, who was appointed Acting-Lieutenant in command of the vessel.King's Warrant to Mr John Murray, 3 Sep. 1801, (Enclosure No.1c of King to Nepean 31 Oct. 1801) HRA, Ser. I, Vol. III, p. 274 and 517. == Exploration of Bass Strait by Murray, discovery of Port Phillip == Murray was ordered to proceed to Bass Strait and survey those parts not covered during Lady Nelsons earlier voyages.King to Murray, 31 Oct. 1801, TNA ADM 1/2019, AJCP PRO 3273 and HRNSW, Vol. IV, pp. 602‚Äì604. Lady Nelson was victualled for a voyage of six months and left Port Jackson on her second survey voyage of Bass Strait on 12 November 1801. Land was sighted on 19 November that turned out to be Flinders Island, in the Furneaux Group, off the north-west tip of Tasmania, and not the Kent Group as intended. Lady Nelson anchored between Store House and Cat Islands in the Babel group of islands, off the east coast of Flinders Island, and remained there until 24 November. From the Furneaux Group, Lady Nelson headed for the Kent Group and anchored in West Cove on the eastern side of Erith Island. Lady Nelson remained in West Cove until 4 December during which time the channel, now known as Murray Pass, was comprehensively surveyed using her boats. From the Kent Group Lady Nelson headed north-west, passing Wilson's Promontory and Cape Liptrap and anchoring in Western Port on 7 December. Bad weather detained Lady Nelson in Western Port for several days, during which time she had to re-anchor several times. A light easterly wind enabled Lady Nelson to leave the anchorage in Western Port on 4 January. After stopping in Elizabeths Cove to replenish water casks, she followed the coast to the west. The next day: > at 3 p.m. we saw a headland bearing west-north-west, distant about 12 miles > and an opening in the land that had the appearance of a harbour north-west > 10 or 12 miles. Lady Nelson sailed to within 1 miles of the entrance and from the masthead Murray observed: > a sheet of smooth water .... and is apparently a fine harbour of large > extent. Murray did not attempt to approach any closer to the harbour because of a fresh on-shore wind. Not being able to enter, the as yet unnamed Port Phillip, Murray continued west towards Cape Otway but was unable to make any further progress westwards due to a south-westerly gale and headed for calmer waters to the eastern side of King Island. Lady Nelson remained in the vicinity of King Island until 24 January during which time all except the west coast had been surveyed. As Murray 'took leave of this large and fine island', he noted: > I much lament not having as yet had it in my power from the series of > unfavourable weather we have met with so exactly to comply with the > Commander-in-Chief's orders as I could wished. Lady Nelson left King Island on 24 January, and headed north intending to run to Cape Otway. However the weather intervened, Murray noting: 'I shall only observe that I never experienced such a length of bad weather at any time of the year, or in any country since I sailed the seas.' On sighting the land on 30 January Murray 'perceived with surprise that it was Cape Shanks [Cape Schanck] and Grant's Point instead of Cape Albany'. (Lady Nelson had been blown several miles to the east.) Lady Nelson therefore returned to Western Port and anchored there on 31 January 1802. Murray 'sent the launch with Mr. Bowen and five men, armed with 14 days provisions and water', to the westward to examine the entrance discovered earlier in the voyage (5 January 1802). Bowen returned on 4 February and reported that a good channel had been found into this new harbour that was larger than Western Port. Lady Nelsons launch was therefore the first European vessel to enter Port Phillip. Lady Nelson was unable to leave Western Port to examine the new harbour for several days due to light winds, Murray noting in his log on 13 February 1802: > it fell calm and our hopes of getting to sea this day vanished, it is almost > needless to observe that this kind of weather is as destructive to the > intent of this cruise as gales at sea. A favourable wind enabled Lady Nelson to leave Western Port at 5 a.m. on 14 February. 'By noon the Island in the entrance of this harbour bore north half a mile distant' and the newly found harbour was entered, 'with all sail set', shortly after mid-day. Murray named the new harbour Port King, but Governor King later renamed it Port Phillip after the first Governor, Captain Arthur Phillip. Lady Nelson remained in Port Phillip for 25 days and on 8 March 1802 Murray proceeded: > to take possession of this Port in the form and manner laid down ... , and > accordingly at 8 o'clock in the morning the United Colours of the Kingdoms > of Great Britain and Ireland were hoisted on board and on Point Patterson, > and at one o'clock under a discharge of three volleys of small arms and > artillery the Port was taken possession of in the name of his Sacred Majesty > George the Third of Great Britain and Ireland, King, etc., etc. The city of Melbourne was eventually to grow on the north shore of this port. Lady Nelson left Port Phillip on 11 March and returned to Port Jackson, anchoring in Sydney Cove on 25 March 1802. ==Tender to the Investigator== In May 1802, King received instructions that Lady Nelson was to be employed as a tender to , during a planned voyage of discovery around the coast of New Holland, and that whilst so employed, Murray was to follow any orders he might receive from its commander, Captain Matthew Flinders.Nepean to King, 23 Jun. 1801, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. III, pp. 109‚Äì110 (When he wrote the letter, Nepean would not have known that Murray had replaced Grant.) Portland to King, 26 Jun. 1801, TNA CO 202/5, AJCP PRO 56 and HRA, I, III, 110 (Investigator carried these despatches to Port Jackson.) Lady Nelson and Investigator sailed from Port Jackson on 22 July 1802 and headed north.Flinders 1814, Vol. II, p. 2. Murray was directed, in case the two vessels became separated, to rendezvous in Hervey Bay.Flinders 1814, Vol. II, p. 1. Lady Nelson had difficulty in keeping up with Investigator, but was able to keep their rendezvous at Hervey Bay. Both vessels continued northwards and Lady Nelson was, on occasion, able to survey parts of the coast where the deeper draught Investigator could not safely go. At times, Flinders left Investigator at anchor and boarded Lady Nelson to continue his survey work. Flinders carried out surveys in Keppel Bay, Shoalwater Bay and Broad Sound and Lady Nelson was present when Flinders discovered and named Port Curtis and Port Bowen (since renamed Port Clinton). Lady Nelson grounded several times, resulting in damage to her sliding keels, in consequence of which Murray had further difficulty keeping-up with Investigator. After leaving Broad Sound Flinders headed for a cluster of islands, to the east of the Northumberland Isles, which he had seen from a hill at Shoalwater Bay. Both vessels anchored there on 29 September and Flinders named them Percy Isles. Both vessels left the Percy Isles on 4 October and Flinders spent several days looking for a passage through the reef, anchoring several times in the process. Investigator lost an anchor and Lady Nelson lost one and broke one arm off another. Flinders decided not to attempt any more narrow passages through the reef and resumed the voyage towards Torres Strait and the Gulf of Carpentaria. Flinders provided Lady Nelson with two grapnels, which was all that Investigator could spare.Flinders 1814, Vol. II, pp. 90‚Äì91. On 17 October Murray noted: > I have now had several opportunities of seeing that from the want of our > main and after keels we are so leewardly that the Investigator in 6 hours > will get with ease 4 miles to windward of the brig. On the same day Flinders decided to send Lady Nelson back to Port Jackson. She was sailing so poorly since losing her keels, that she not only delayed Investigator, but ran great risk of herself being lost. Furthermore, instead of saving the crew of Investigator, in case of accident, which was one of the main reasons for having a tender, it was likely Investigator might be called upon to save Lady Nelson. Flinders saw Lady Nelson, after her loss of anchors and cables, replacements for which Investigator could not spare without endangering her own safety, becoming a burden rather than an assistance.Flinders 1814, Vol. II, p. 96. Murray received orders from Flinders 'to proceed to Port Jackson with the Lady Nelson as fast as circumstances would allow', and a letter to deliver to Governor King.Flinders to King, His Majesty's Sloop Investigator, Off Cumberland Isles, 18 October 1802, HRNSW, Vol. IV, pp. 857‚Äì860 and HRA, Ser. I, Vol. III, pp. 740‚Äì742. Investigator headed north and Lady Nelson headed south. By 10.40 am, on 18 October, Investigators topsails could just be seen from Lady Nelson, disappearing over the horizon. This was the end of Lady Nelsons voyages of discovery. Lady Nelson headed south, anchoring occasionally with the broken anchor, but, when pausing at Cape Townshend on 28 October, this anchor was lost. The remaining anchor was let go, but, in the process, Lady Nelson drifted away from the intended anchorage. With only one remaining anchor, and only one small boat, Lady Nelson was in a precarious situation. As it was essential to move to a safer anchorage, Murray improvised an anchor by lashing two swivel guns together, which enabled Lady Nelson to sail into a more sheltered anchorage in Shoalwater Bay. The carpenter then went ashore in the boat to find an iron- bark tree with which to make a replacement anchor. The remainder of the voyage to Port Jackson was uneventful and Lady Nelson anchored in Sydney Cove at 10.40 am on 22 November 1802. Before her next significant voyage, Lady Nelson made another trip to Norfolk Island to convey troops to relieve the garrison there. This was probably Lady Nelson last voyage under Murray. Lady Nelsonss next commander was George Curtoys, (sometimes spelt Courtoys but spelt Curtoys in the commander's own log), previously the master's mate of , which had arrived from England in March 1803.King to Nepean, 12 Apr. 1803, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. IV, pp. 68‚Äì69. ==The Settlement of the Derwent== Lady Nelson was one of the vessels selected to establish the first settlement in Tasmania. The desire to settle that part of Australia arose from King's concern that Baudin, leader of the French expedition in La Naturaliste, intended to establish a settlement on the east side of Van Diemen's Land.King to Hobart, 9 Nov. 1802, TNA CO 201/22, AJCP PRO 11 and HRA, Ser. I, Vol. III, pp. 697‚Äì699. King to Hobart, 23 Nov. 1802, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. III, p. 737. King to Hobart, 9 May 1803, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. IV, pp. 143‚Äì148. King to Nepean, 9 May 1803, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. IV, pp. 247‚Äì252. King chose Risdon Cove, on the east bank of the river Derwent, near where the city of Hobart now stands, as the site for the new settlement. Matthew Flinders and George Bass had previously visited the site during their circumnavigation of Van Diemen's Land. An initial expedition to establish British sovereignty over Van Diemen's Land was made by Acting- Lieutenant Charles Robbins, who left Port Jackson in on 23 November 1802. Lieutenant John Bowen, an officer in the recently arrived Glatton, was chosen as Commandant and Superintendent of the new settlement and was instructed to proceed with Lady Nelson and Porpoise, and with the men, women, stores, and provisions necessary for forming the intended settlement.King's Instructions to Lieutenant Bowen, 28 Mar. 1803, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. IV, pp. 152‚Äì153. The vessels departed for the Derwent on 11 and 17 June 1803 respectively. Lady Nelson made good progress until 15 June when she encountered a strong southerly wind and Curtoys decided to head for shelter in Twofold Bay. The adverse winds continued for several days, driving her back to the north; on 21 June heavy seas resulted in the loss of the Lady Nelsons boat. The safety of Twofold Bay was not reached until 24 June by which time all Lady Nelsons supply of bread had been consumed and only three casks of water remained. A raft was constructed from her spars in order to get ashore to replenish their supply of fresh water and the Lady Nelsons carpenter was sent to cut timber with which to build a punt to replace the lost boat. Lady Nelson left Twofold Bay on 1 July to continue her voyage, but soon afterwards part of the main keel was seen drifting away astern. At this point the voyage was aborted and Lady Nelson returned to Port Jackson. Lady Nelson arrived back in Port Jackson on 5 July and found that Porpoise had also turned back and had arrived two days earlier.Gazette, 17 Jul. 1803. Lady Nelson departed again on 21 August 1803 but, two days out, her main mast was found to be sprung (damaged). Once again she had to return.Gazette, 28 Aug. 1803. Lady Nelson was repaired and set off again on 29 August 1803, this time accompanied by the whaler Albion. Lady Nelson had a reasonably uneventful voyage and anchored in Risden Cove on the River Derwent on 9 September 1803. Albion arrived two days later. The next several days were employed in landing stores and establishing the settlers on shore. Both vessels had departed before the end of September leaving the settlement, comprising 49 souls, with no means of communication with the outside world. == Evacuation of the Settlement at Port Phillip == In October 1803 two ships, Ocean and , arrived in Port Phillip, from England, with the intention of establishing a settlement. Lieutenant-Colonel David Collins was to be Lieutenant-Governor of the new settlement.Hobart to Collins, 7 Feb.1803, TNA CO 202/6, AJCP PRO 56 and HRA, Ser. I, Vol. IV, pp. 10‚Äì16. The venture was unsuccessful and a decision was taken to abandon the settlement and move its people to Van Diemen's Land. Two locations were considered: either the existing settlement on the Derwent, or a new settlement at Port Dalrymple.HRA, Ser. III, Vol. I, pp. xv‚Äìxx. As the only vessels available, Lady Nelson and Francis, could not have carried out the task in a reasonable time, King hired the transport Ocean and the whaler Edwin to assist them. The 'fleet' therefore comprised four vessels. George Curtoys, who had been ill for some time, had to relinquish command of Lady Nelson in November 1803, and returned to England in .King to Nepean, 1 Mar. 1804, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. IV, pp. 556‚Äì557. He was replaced by James Symons, previously Calcuttas Mate, who took command for the voyage to Port Phillip. Lady Nelson left Port Jackson on 28 November 1803. On board was the naturalist Robert Brown, one of the scientific people who came from England on Investigator. Rough weather was experienced on arriving in Bass Strait, and after beating a fortnight against a south-westerly wind, Lady Nelson took refuge in the Kent Group. Twice Lady Nelson left the anchorage there to try to reach the destination, and twice she had to return.Robert Brown to Banks, at anchor, Kent's Group, Bass's Strait, 30 Dec. 1803, The British Library, MS 32439 folio 144 and AJCP M1139. Ocean arrived at Port Phillip on 12 December 1803 and Francis the next day. The master of Francis reported to Colonel Collins having seen smoke rising from one of the islands in the Kent Group. This raised concerns over the safety of Lady Nelson, which had not yet arrived at Port Phillip. Colonel Collins sent William Collins, in Francis, to assess the suitability of Port Dalrymple as a place to re-settle the people from Port Phillip. The master of Francis was requested to sail via the Kent Group to look for Lady Nelson. William Collins found Lady Nelson in the Kent Group but by this time Francis herself was in a very leaky condition and was sent back to Port Jackson. William Collins continued to Port Dalrymple in Lady Nelson, arriving there on 1 January 1804 and remaining until 18 January 1804. William Collins arrived back in Port Phillip, aboard Lady Nelson on 21 January 1804, with a favourable report on Port Dalrymple, but Colonel Collins had already decided to move to the Derwent.Collins to King, 27 Jan. 1804, HRA, Ser. III, Vol. I, pp. 53‚Äì54. Knopwood 1977, p. 39. Lady Nelson and Ocean left Port Phillip for the Derwent with the first contingent of settlers on 30 January 1804.Knopwood 1977, 40. Ocean returned to Port Phillip later and brought the remainder of the people. Lady Nelson left the Derwent on 6 March and arrived back in Port Jackson on 14 March 1804. During the next few months Lady Nelson was employed on various transport duties which included taking people to a new settlement to be established at Kingstown, soon after renamed Newcastle, on the Hunter.Gazette, 1 and 22 Apr. 1804. ==The settlement of Port Dalrymple== In May 1804 King received instructions to close the settlement at Norfolk Island and transfer its existing settlers from there to a new settlement at Port Dalrymple in Van Diemen's Land; Bass and Flinders had discovered Port Dalrymple during their circumnavigation of Van Diemen's Land. Lieutenant Colonel Paterson was placed in charge as Lieutenant-Governor of the new settlement.King to Paterson, 1 Jun. 1804, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. V, pp. 22‚Äì24. To prepare the new settlement, for the people from Norfolk Island, Paterson left Port Jackson in the cutter Integrity, accompanied by the sloop Contest, on 7 June 1804, but bad weather forced both vessels back to port.King to Hobart, 14 Aug. 1804, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. V, pp. 1‚Äì18. Paterson subsequently departed on Buffalo on 15 October 1804 accompanied by Lady Nelson, Francis, and Integrity.King to Hobart, 20 Dec. 1804, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. V, pp. 212‚Äì215. At first good progress was made down the coast and Lady Nelsons log reported the 'squadron in company' on 18 October. On 22 October Lady Nelson encountered 'strong gales with a heavy sea from south-west' that caused considerable damage including the boat, binnacle and two compasses being washed overboard; and the main sheet carrying away and breaking the tiller. The next day the fore keel was found to have been broken-off and Symons decided to head into Twofold Bay for shelter and to carry out repairs to the vessel. Lady Nelson anchored on the southern shore of Twofold Bay on 25 October and the crew again had to improvise a raft from the vessel's spars to get ashore. Lady Nelson got under way again on 3 November; attempts to leave on 1 and 2 November were both aborted due to the weather. She encountered the sloop George, which was bound for the Derwent from Port Jackson, shortly after leaving Twofold Bay and its master gave a boat's compass to Symons to replace those lost in the storm. The bad weather continued: *on 5 November 'the main top-sail blown out of the bolt rope and was lost', *on 6 November 'at 4 pm took in all sail'; and *on 7 November 'Strong gales and bad sea. At 8 blew the fore stay-sail totally away and split the main stay-sail.' Lady Nelson headed down the western side of Flinders Island, sighted Cape Barren on 9 November, 'beat in through the narrows' and on 10 November reached Kent's Bay, on the south side of Cape Barren Island, where the schooner Francis was found at anchor, also sheltering from the weather. Lady Nelson remained in Kent's Bay, repairing storm damage, until 13 November when both vessels got under way. The next day Lady Nelson sought shelter at Waterhouse Island and remained there until 20 November when the weather improved. Lady Nelson, with Francis in company, finally reached Port Dalrymple on 21 November 1804. Buffalo, a larger vessel, had arrived on 4 November 1804, and Integrity had arrived the next day. After she had unloaded her cargo, Lady Nelson was employed in surveying and erecting beacons in the harbour to facilitate the safe entry of ships into the new port. Buffalo and Integrity departed on 27 November, and Francis on 29 December 1804. Lady Nelson, the last of the small squadron to leave, departed on 11 January 1805. The settlement was initially located at Outer Cove on the east side of the River Tamar but soon relocated to York Cove on the west side of the river. Eventually the settlement was moved further up the river to a spot near the confluence of the North and South Esk rivers that Paterson named Launceston. Lady Nelson arrived back in Port Jackson on 23 January 1805. ==Capture of Extreme√±a== In April 1805 King received information that suggested that a Spanish armed schooner was anchored in Jervis Bay, 90 miles to the south of Sydney. King sent Lady Nelson, under the command of Acting-Lieutenant Symons, to look for the Spanish vessel and, if found, bring her to Port Jackson. The Spanish vessel was Extreme√±a, an armed merchant vessel owned by merchants in Madras had seized on the coast of Chile. Britain and Spain were not at war at the time of the seizure, which was therefore illegal. On sighting Lady Nelson, Extreme√±a tried to escape but Symons fired a shot across her bows, arrested her, and escorted her back to Port Jackson. ==Later Service== Lady Nelson continued to be employed in carrying passengers and supplies between Port Jackson and the other settlements along the coast of New South Wales and Tasmania for many years. Some of these voyages were recorded in the newspapers of the time. A few of these voyages are mentioned below where of particular interest. She made a voyage to New Zealand in 1806 to return Tip-pa-he, a Maori Chief, to his residence.King to Camden, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies 1804 to 1805, 15 Mar. 1806, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. V, pp. 642‚Äì661 (para. 44). King to Castlereagh, 27 Jul. 1806, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. V, pp. 748‚Äì754 (para. 20). Gazette 2 Mar. and 15 Jun. 1806. Tip-pa-he, was the head of the Maoris inhabiting the country contiguous to the Bay of Islands. Five of his sons accompanied him. Lady Nelson was laid-up for a while at the time of the departure of Governor Bligh to England in March 1809, but soon returned to service and made four voyages to Hunter's River before the end of the year.Bligh to Pole, First Secretary to the Admiralty 1807 to 1809, 5 Apr. 1809, HRA, Ser.

Governor Lachlan Macquarie sailed in Lady Nelson to conduct a tour of inspection of the two settlements in Van Diemen's Land. She left Port Jackson on 4 November 1811 and returned on 6 January 1812, after calling at Newcastle and Port Stephens.Gazette 9 Nov. 1811.

I, Vol. VII, pp. 580‚Äì617 (para. 6 & 7) and Enclosure No. 1. The evacuation of Norfolk Island, commenced in 1804, was not completed until 1813. \\"Lady Nelson\\" made three voyages to VDL between 1807 -1813, the first in 1807 carried 35 men, women, and children from Norfolk Island to Hobart Town. The 15 men and one woman had been convicts sent to Norfolk Island but were now free settlers. Her second voyage was in 1808 when she carried 25 men women and child from Norfolk Island to Hobart Town. Her last voyage from Norfolk Island to Port Dalrymple was in 1813 when she carried 43 men women and children.Exiled Three Times Over, by Irene Schaffer and Thelma McKay. Lady Nelson left Port Jackson in December 1812, and a hired ship, Minstrel, left in January 1813. After embarking the settlers at Norfolk Island, both vessels had arrived in Port Dalrymple by 4 March 1813.Macquarie to Bathurst, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies 1812 to 1827 (Bathurst), 28 Jun. 1813, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. VII, pp. 707‚Äì730 (item 7). Gazette 10 Apr. 1813. Governor Macquarie left Sydney on 21 February 1816 and travelled overland to Windsor. He returned on board Lady Nelson to see the progress of the settlements along the Hawkesbury River and arrived back in Sydney on 26 February.Gazette, 24 Feb. & 2 Mar. 1816. On 8 May 1819 Lady Nelson, accompanied by Mermaid, left Port Jackson to carry out a survey of the entrance to Port Macquarie. On board was the Surveyor General, Lieutenant John Oxley RN, who had discovered and named the entrance during an overland expedition the previous year.Gazette, 8 May 1819. A decision was subsequently taken to establish a settlement at Port Macquarie.Bathurst to Macquarie, 18 May 1820, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. X, p. 306. The establishment comprised 60 convicts and a detachment of 40 troops. They left Sydney on 21 March 1821 on board Lady Nelson, Prince Regent, and Mermaid.Gazette, 24 Mar. 1821. The passage was unusually long due to adverse winds. While entering the river on 17 April Lady Nelson struck a sunken rock, but soon got off. Prince Regent also sustained damage, and Mermaid got aground the next day in crossing the bar, losing her rudder in the process.Captain Francis Allman, 48th Regiment, Commandant at Port Macquarie (Allman), to Goulburn, Under Secretary of State for War and the Colonies 1816 to 1821 (Goulburn), 19 Apr. 1821, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. X, pp. 517‚Äì518. Lady Nelson was quickly repaired and ordered to return to Sydney to get help to repair the other two vessels but ran aground on rocks inside the bar when departing on 2 May 1821.

Lady Nelson was eventually repaired but did not return to Port Jackson until 1 May 1822, after an absence of 13 months.Gazette, 3 May 1822. In 1824 the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies directed that a settlement be formed on the north- west coast of the continent.Bathurst to Thomas Brisbane, Governor of New South Wales 1821 to 1825 (Brisbane), 17 Feb. 1824, HRA, Ser.

The expedition embarked on , Captain Bremer, the transport ship , Captain Bunn, and Lady Nelson, Mr Johns, Master.Brisbane to Bathurst, 12 Aug. 1824, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. XI, p. 338. Gazette 26 Aug. 1824. The three vessels sailed on 24 August 1824 and anchored in a cove in the strait between Melville Island and Bathurst Island. The cove was named King's Cove, and the expedition chose the south-east point of the cove for the settlement, and named it Point Barlow. The entrance to the anchorage was named Port Cockburn.Gazette 10 Mar. 1825. Parties were sent ashore on 1 October to clear the ground and lay the foundations of a fort that they called Fort Dundas. On 8 September construction began on a pier to land provisions and heavy stores. The establishment was in place by 10 November, and on 13 November 1824 Countess of Harcourt and Tamar departed, leaving Captain Maurice Barlow of the 3rd Regiment of Foot (the Buffs), in charge. Lady Nelson remained as a guard and supply ship. The settlement possessed rations for twelve months but there was no fresh meat. In December 1824, Barlow sent Lady Nelson and George Miller, who was responsible for maintaining a supply of provisions, to the Dutch settlement at Kupang on the island of Timor for supplies. Miller procured some buffaloes and goats, but most of the animals died before she returned to the settlement on 2 January 1825.Gazette 11 Sep. 1832. Within a week, Lady Nelson departed again to procure more livestock and whilst at Koepang, Miller encountered the schooner , bound from England to the new settlement at Melville Island. Lady Nelson returned with thirty small pigs that were lean and unfit for immediate use. During the five weeks Lady Nelson had been away scurvy had made its appearance among the prisoners, which made it imperative to obtain fresh provisions. Lady Nelson therefore sailed again, with directions from Barlow that Johns purchase whatever livestock he could get. When Stedcombe arrived at Port Cockburn, her Master entered into an agreement with Barlow to land, at the settlement, a cargo of buffalo, averaging 250 pounds (113 kg) in weight each, for a price of 25 Spanish Dollars each, and binding him to return in five weeks. Lady Nelson departed on the 19th and Stedcombe on 23 February 1825.Miller to George Harrison, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, 7 May 1825, HRA, Ser. I, Vol. XII, pp. 188‚Äì189. In a letter dated 19 May 1825, Barlow wrote 'his schooner [Stedcombe] left this port four days after Johns' departure [in Lady Nelson], in charge of his Chief Mate, neither have returned since. I fear they either have been wrecked or fallen into the hands of the Malay Pirates'.Barlow to Owens, 19 May 1825, SRA, Reel 6066, 4/1802 pp. 39‚Äì54. ==Final Resting Place== Brief reports of the fate of the Lady Nelson appeared in the Gazette over the next few months: > The Lady Nelson, brig, had been most unfortunately cut off at Timor by the > Malay privateers, and all the crew sacrificed, save the Captain.Gazette, 22 > Sep. 1825. > By the arrival of the Faith, we learn, that the Lady Nelson had been > despatched from Melville Island for fresh provisions to some of the islands > in the neighbourhood of Timor, with instructions to avoid an island named > Babba [Babar], where they would be great danger of her being cut off.

A gun, said to have been on Lady Nelson when she was lost, was examined in the village of Tutawawang, on Babar Island, in 1981 but no definitive conclusions appear to have been reached as to its provenance.Spillet 1982. ==Replica vesselsMount Gambier Replica (1986, rebuilt 2011‚Äì12)=== Replica at Lady Nelson Visitor & Discovery Centre, Mount Gambier The Lady Nelson Visitor & Discovery Centre, Mount Gambier, South Australia, in 1986 built a full size non-sailing, replica of Lady Nelson in association with the commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the proclamation of the colony of South Australia on 28 December 1836. In 2011 a survey of the replica found extensive rot in the hull timbers that put her beyond repair. The Maritime Village Boatyard, at Flagstaff Hill Maritime Village, Warrnambool, Victoria, was commissioned to assess the condition of the replica and develop a plan for her restoration. The restoration completely replaced the hull with a fiberglass sheathed structure and the timber lower masts ith galvanised steel. The existing upper masts, spars and rigging were retained. The rebuilt replica was transported from Warrnambool to Mount Gambier by road and mounted on a concrete slab; it now forms a tourist attraction at the Discovery Centre. ===Tasmanian Sail Training Association Replica (1988)=== Replica of the Lady Nelson in Hobart Replica of the Lady Nelson in Hobart The Tasmanian Sail Training Association was established to build and sail a replica of the Lady Nelson as part of the celebrations to mark the 200th anniversary of the European settlement of Australia in January 1788. She was built at a cost of more than $700,000 largely funded by Tasmanian taxpayers via the State Government, with assistance from local and corporate sponsors. Cusick 2007. Ray Kemp built the replica at Woodbridge near Hobart in Tasmania. He built it largely from Tasmanian-grown timbers: blue gum keel and frames, celery-top pine deck, and Douglas fir lower masts. The spars are American-grown Oregon. Kemp launched Lady Nelson on 29 November 1987. A commissioning ceremony was held on 17 December 1988 and the replica went on its first cruise, on the River Derwent, in March 1989. From July 1990 to early 1996 the replica Lady Nelson went on several voyages during the cold Tasmanian winter, across Bass Strait to Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland.The vessel also followed the fleets of the Melbourne to Hobart yacht race in 1993 and 1994. In more recent times the vessel has travelled: *January 1998, to Sydney to participate in the Tall Ships Race to Hobart and on its return carried out a circumnavigation of Tasmania. *Late 2000, to Portland in Victoria to commemorate the passage of the Lady Nelson through Bass Strait in December 1800. *March 2001, to Western Port to re-enact the Lady Nelsons first entry into the port in March 1801. *On 14 February 2002 the replica sailed into Port Phillip Bay; exactly 200 years to the day after the Lady Nelsons entry into the bay. *In 2003 the replica visited Sorrento in Port Phillip Bay to commemorate the arrival of the first settlers in Port Phillip, on the ships Ocean and Calcutta, in October 1803. ==NotesFootnotes=Citations=References=== * Australian Joint Copying Project (AJCP) * Bladen, F.

He is currently the manager of the Acereros de Monclova of the Mexican League. ==Amateur career== Listach attended for the McLennan Community College in Waco, Texas, where he played college baseball for the Highlanders. He transferred to Arizona State University, continuing his collegiate career with the Arizona State Sun Devils. ==Professional career== Listach was drafted in the 5th round of the 1988 Major League Baseball Draft by the Milwaukee Brewers. Listach's best professional season was in , his rookie year. After being called up from the minor leagues by the Brewers in April, Listach became a vital member of a team that won 92 games and contended for the American League playoffs. Listach became the first Brewer to steal 50 or more bases in a single season. His 54 stolen bases in 1992 ranked second only to the total accrued by Kenny Lofton, another prominent rookie from the Cleveland Indians, during that season. Listach would go on to win the 1992 American League Rookie of the Year award. In 1996 Listach was traded to the New York Yankees along with Graeme Lloyd for outfielder Gerald Williams and pitcher Bob Wickman. With rookie Derek Jeter installed at shortstop the Yankees intended to use Listach as a backup outfielder, as they made the trade specifically to acquire Lloyd. Listach, however, had suffered what was first thought to be a bruise two days prior to the trade. The injury turned out to be a broken bone in his foot. The Yankees returned Listach to the Brewers, accepting shortstop Gabby Martinez instead. Listach played only 52 games in the Majors after 1996, all for the Houston Astros in 1997. Listach spent 1998 Spring Training with the Seattle Mariners, who released him before the season. He spent that season with the Triple-A affiliates of the Cleveland Indians and Philadelphia Phillies before retiring. ==Coaching career== as 2012 Chicago Cubs 3rd base coach Listach became a manager in the Chicago Cubs minor league system. He managed the Double-A West Tenn Diamond Jaxx in , the Tennessee Smokies in , and the Triple-A Iowa Cubs in . In 2008 Listach was honored as Pacific Coast League Manager of the Year by peers and league media representatives for leading the Iowa Cubs to an 83-59 record and a playoff appearance. Listach became the Washington Nationals' third-base coach starting with the season. Listach served as bench coach for the Chicago Cubs for the 2011 season, replacing Alan Trammell who left to become the Diamondbacks bench coach. Listach was replaced by new bench coach, Jamie Quirk, during the 2011 off-season, and became the Cubs third-base coach for the 2012 season. He became the minor league infield coordinator for the Los Angeles Dodgers organization in 2013. Listach was hired by the Houston Astros to be their first base coach on October 22, 2013; he was fired by the Astros on October 17, 2014. Listach then returned to the Mariners' organization when he was named manager of the Class AAA Tacoma Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League, on January 12, 2015. http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20150112&content;_id=106215922&fext;=.jsp&vkey;=news_t529&sid;=t529 Following the 2018 season, after compiling a 281-286 record in four seasons, the Mariners announced that Listach's contract with Tacoma was not being renewed.

It is closely related to other Ethnic Studies disciplines, such as African American Studies, Latino/a Studies, and Native American Studies. ==History== Asian American Studies appeared as a field of intellectual inquiry in the late 1960sShirley Hune. \\"Expanding the International Dimension of Asian American Studies\\". Amerasia Journal, Vol. 15 No. 2 (1989), pp.xix as a result of strikes by the Third World Liberation Front, a group of Filipino students at San Francisco State University and at the University of California, Berkeley, which demanded that college classroom instruction include the histories of people of color in the United States told from their perspectives. The demand for Ethnic Studies was a critical response to the Eurocentric bias in university curriculum. As a result, a College of Ethnic Studies (the only such \\"college\\" at any American university at the time) became established at San Francisco State University with American Indian Studies, Asian American Studies, Africana Studies, and Latino/a Studies as its four units,San Francisco State University: Asian American Studies. and four ethnic studies programs became established at the University of California, Berkeley. The Association for Asian American Studies, a professional organization designed to promote teaching and research in the field, was established in 1979. ==Topics in Asian American Studies== Drawing from numerous disciplines such as sociology, history, literature, political science, and gender studies, Asian American Studies scholars consider a variety of perspectives and employ diverse analytical tools in their work. Unlike \\"Asian\\" Studies which focuses on the history, culture, religion, etc. of Asian people living in Asia, Asian American Studies is interested in the history, culture, experiences, of Asians living in the United States. Academic programs in Asian American Studies provide students with the opportunity to examine the history of Asian- Americans, which includes topics such as immigration and race-based exclusion policies.L. Ling-Chi Wang. \\"Asian American Studies\\" American Quarterly Vol. 33, No. 3 (1981), pp. 339-354 Asian American Studies provides an academic avenue for addressing issues of racial oppression, capitalism at home, and imperialism abroad.L.

Ling-Chi Wang. \\"Asian American Studies\\" American Quarterly Vol. 33, No. 3 (1981), pp. 339-354 Asian American Studies focuses on the identities, historical and contemporary experiences of individuals and groups in the United States.

Outside of California, major programs include Dartmouth College, University of Washington, University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, University of Maryland, College Park, University of Colorado, Hunter College, Cornell University, Binghamton University, and Columbia University. Other rising programs include Arizona State University, New York University, Northwestern University, University of Pennsylvania and University of Minnesota. Currently, several universities, including University of North Carolina, University of Virginia, Syracuse University, and many others are in the process of developing Asian American Studies departments. Master of Arts in Asian American Studies programs are available at UCLA and SFSU. At the time of its founding (by Lee C. Lee) in 1987, the Asian American Studies Program at Cornell University was the first such program in the Ivy League and on the east coast. Today it has four core faculty members in the humanities and social sciences in a variety of departments and colleges. This cross-college, university-wide position accommodates the extensive teaching and research interests of the Program's faculty and reflects the breadth of the vibrant field of Asian American Studies in general. In the classroom, in scholarship, and through campus and community advocacy, the Program is committed to examining the histories and experiences; identities, social and community formations; politics; and contemporary concerns of people of Asian ancestry in the United States and other parts of the Americas. On the East Coast, the State University of New York at Stony Brook created an Asian & Asian American Studies Department after a 52 million dollar donation by Charles B. Wang (the founder of Computer Associates). The Charles B. Wang Center is designed as a vital space for multi-disciplinary and multicultural dialogues. The building was officially presented to Stony Brook University by Charles B. Wang on October 22, 2002. It was the largest single private gift ever received by the State University of New York 64-campus system. The Wang Center is used for conferences, art exhibits, film festivals, lectures, seminars, and performances. It is open to all Stony Brook students, faculty, and staff as well as the surrounding community. Hunter College, City University of New York, located in the Upper East Side in Manhattan is home to the only Asian American Studies Program in the CUNY system. The program was established in 1993 through student and faculty activism, with Peter Kwong as the inaugural director. Despite offering the largest number of Asian American Studies courses in New York City, Hunter College does not have an Asian American Studies department nor does it offer an Asian American Studies major. In 2006, when the program was under threat of being cut, student activists formed The Coalition for the Revitalization of Asian American Studies at Hunter to fight to keep Asian American Studies. The students succeeded in saving the minor program, and they continue to fight for an Asian American Studies major and department. Queens College, City University of New York, located in the neighborhood of Flushing in New York City, is home to the Asian/American Center. It was established to conduct research with community needs in mind. It serves as a hub for research into Asian American issues, particularly focusing on the Asian diaspora in the New York area, and offers a minor in Asian American Community Studies (AACS). ==References * Association for Asian American Studies * UCLA Asian American Studies Center * Asian-Nation: Asian American History, Demographics, and News *Documentary Film Exploring Vietnamese American History Category:American studies Category:Asian-American issues Category:Asian-American culture Category:Asian studies Category:Ethnic studies ","title":"Asian American studies"},{"id":"2230239","text":"{ align=\\"right\\" style=\\"clear: both;\\"  { + Buff as an RYB quaternary colour -  -  -  } } Buff is the light brownish yellow colour of buff leather. Buff is ochreous-like colour.The Oxford English Dictionary (OED). Second Edition (20 Volume Set). Clarendon Press, 1989 As an RYB quaternary colour, it is the colour produced by an equal mix of the tertiary colours citron and russet.William J. Miskella, 1928, Practical Color Simplified: A Handbook on Lacquering, Enameling, Coloring And Painting; John Lemos, 1920, \\"Color Charts for the School Room\\", in School Arts, vol. 19, pp 580‚Äì584 ==Etymology== The first recorded use of the word buff to describe a colour was in The London Gazette of 1686, describing a uniform to be \\"...a Red Coat with a Buff- colour'd lining\\". It referred to the colour of undyed buffalo leather, such as soldiers wore as some protection: an eyewitness to the death in the Battle of Edgehill (1642) of Sir Edmund Verney noted \\"he would neither put on arms [armour] or buff coat the day of the battle\\".Miriam Slater, Family Life in the Seventeenth Century: the Verneys of Claydon House 1984:11. Such buff leather was suitable for buffing or serving as a buffer between polished objects. It is not clear which bovine \\"buffalo\\" referred to, but it may not have been any of the animals called \\"buffalo\\" today. ===Derived terms=== The word buff meaning \\"enthusiast\\" or \\"expert\\" (US English) derives from the colour \\"buff\\", specifically from the buff-coloured uniform facings of 19th-century New York City volunteer firemen, who inspired partisan followers among particularly keen fire watchers.Robert W. Masters \\"What is a Fire Buff?\\", Pictorial History of Firefighting, revised edition, 1967; Steve Hanson, \\"Fire buffs: who are they?\\". \\"In the buff\\", today meaning naked, originally applied to English soldiers wearing the buff leather tunic that was their uniform until the 17th century. The \\"naked\\" signification is due to the perception that (English) skin is buff-coloured. == In nature  Geology === Sand, rock, and loess tend to be buff in many areas.

Buff has good camouflage qualities as sand, soil, and dry vegetation are buff in many areas. The term buff coat refers to a part of 17th-century European military uniforms. Such coats were intended to protect the wearer, and the strongest and finest leathers tend to be buff, so the term \\"buff coats\\" came to refer to all such coats, even if the colour varied.

The phrase \\"Steady the Buffs!\\", popularised by Rudyard Kipling in his 1888 work Soldiers Three, has its origins during 2nd Battalion's garrison duties in Malta. Adjutant Cotter, not wanting to be shown up in front of his former regiment, the 21st Royal (North British) Fusiliers, spurred his men on with the words: \\"Steady, the Buffs!

The U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry specifies a \\"buff\\" tincture for certain coats of arms, often treating it as a metal for purposes of the rule of tincture.

Both General Washington and Alexander Hamilton, as chief of staff, had a role in the design of the uniforms. Other school colours described as \\"buff and blue\\" include Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C., and Punahou School in Honolulu, Hawaii.

File:Le_coup_de_maitre.jpgDepiction of the Whig Charles James Fox wearing buff and blue ===White Star buff=== The funnels of the RMS Titanic and all other ships of the White Star Line were designated to be \\"buff with a black top\\" in order to indicate their ownership. There is some uncertainty among experts, however, as to the exact shade of what is now called \\"White Star buff\\". There is no surviving paint or formula, and although there are many painted postcards and at least seven colour photographs of White Star liners, the shades of the funnels in these varies due to many factors including the conditions under which they were originally made and the ageing of the pigments in which they were printed. Speaking mostly to scale modellers, the Titanic Research and Modelling Association currently recommend a colour \\"in the range of the Marschall color\\", meaning the colour in illustrations in a particular book.The TRMA recommend the colour on found on \\"pp. 54, 60-61, and 67 of the new book Art of Titanic\\", presumably Ken Marschall's Art of Titanic 978-0786864553. As a relatively inexpensive and readily available paint colour, and one which went well alongside the near-universal black hull and white superstructure used on steamships at the time, White Star was far from the only shipping line to use a shade of buff as a funnel colour. The Orient Line and Norddeutscher Lloyd used an entirely buff funnel without the black top, while Canadian Pacific and the Swedish American Line employed a buff funnel with a representation of the company's house flag on them. The Bibby Line and the Fyffes Line are two of several firms to use the same \\"buff with a black top\\" scheme as White Star, but with a similar lack of certainty as to the exact shade used and how this differed from the famous White Star scheme. File:Colorful Oceanic.jpgShips of the White Star Line, such as the RMS Oceanic pictured here, and the Titanic, had buff funnels with black tops. ===In Canadian heraldry=== As well as being a colour used by the United States Army Institute of Heraldry, buff is also recognised as a tincture by the Canadian Heraldic Authority. It appears on the heraldic badge and flag of the Correctional Service of Canada. ==See also== *List of colours *Beige, a similar colour *Fallow *Tan, a slightly darker, redder colour *Tawny ==References== Category:Quaternary colors Category:Shades of brown Category:Shades of yellow Category:Shades of orange Category:Colours (heraldry) Category:Metals (heraldry) hi:‡§≠‡•Ç‡§∞‡§æ#‡§¨‡§æ‡§¶‡§æ‡§Æ‡•Ä ","title":"Buff (colour)"},{"id":"2230240","text":"Julius Schulte-Frohlinde (1894 - 1968) was one of Adolf Hitler's architects.

It created the \\"No Frills\\" brand of generic products, promoted by their mascot, \\"Red Sock,\\" and labelled itself \\"Australia's Original Discount Grocer.\\" Franklins also had stores in Queensland, Victoria and South Australia until 2001. In 2011 the chain was bought by Metcash and the stores were sold off to independent buyers to operate as IGA or Aldi supermarkets. The last Franklins was at Westfield Miranda shopping centre; it closed in April 2015. ==HistoryBeginnings (1941‚Äì1978)=== In 1941, Franklins was established in Sydney by Frank Lindstrom. It was his second supermarket chain, having sold his first one to Woolworths. In 1954, Franklins was acquired by Harold Cornock and Norman Tieck. Under their leadership it grew to cover much of New South Wales, and created a reputation for low prices. ===Early Dairy Farm International (1978‚Äì1992)=== In 1978, Cornock and Tieck sold the then 75-store supermarket chain to Hong Kong company Dairy Farm International, a member of the Jardine Matheson group, which maintained the chain's discount focus. Its turnover was A$1 million. Franklins launched its No Frills generic range of products (store brand). This was the first such range in Australia. The 'No Frills' brand became very important to Franklins as it provided the best value to customers. However, unlike Aldi in Europe, Franklins also retained a wide range of brand items. Franklins' stores outside NSW were branded black-and-white 'Franklins No Frills' to emphasize the label. Eventually the name replaced the white-on- red 'Franklins' in the home state of NSW, until the brand reverted to a red, white and black 'Franklins'. In retaliation, Woolworths later launched \\"Home Brand\\" and Coles launched \\"Scotch Buy\\" (later rebranded as \\"Savings\\"). Around this time, Bi-Lo began operations in Adelaide, using a similar format to Franklins. In 1982, Franklins expanded outside of Sydney and ultimately New South Wales to open its first stores in Victoria, at Deer Park, Gladstone Park and Glenferrie. In 1983, Franklins opened its first store in Queensland, at Toowoomba. In 1989, Franklins opened its first store in South Australia. Franklins also launched FRFM, Franklins' own in-house radio station playing songs and advertising specials. By 1989, Franklins had also expanded into the ACT, covering the east coast of mainland Australia and South Australia. ===Late Dairy Farm International (1992‚Äì2001)=== Throughout the 1990s, Dairy Farm International began to introduce new store concepts and branding ideas. In 1990, Franklins opened attached liquor stores under the brand Liquor Save. Franklins also opened its 200th store the same year. In 1992, Franklins Big Fresh was launched. This was a \\"food barn\\" format Dairy Farm had developed in New Zealand as \\"Big Fresh\\". Some existing stores were converted to this format, while others were newly built. These stores featured \\"outback\\" or farm style decorations, and animatronic displays which could be activated by customers ‚Äì including singing chickens and dancing fruit. The first Franklins Big Fresh store opened in Leichhardt, and others were opened in Marrickville, Macquarie Centre and Gosford. The Gosford store featured a unique mini branch of the Commonwealth Bank within the store, as well as a small hairdressing kiosk. The hairdressing kiosk was rolled out to a number of other stores, although not all were the Big Fresh model. At the same time, Franklins started opening a few Mini Fresh stores in Queensland. In 1994, Franklins launched Franklins Fresh, a mainstream supermarket format. In contrast to \\"Franklins No Frills\\" stores, they sold fresh produce, baked goods and meat as well as groceries. The \\"Fresh\\" part of the logo was similar to the one used by Big Fresh. It was designed to be a smaller version of Franklins Big Fresh. The first Franklins Fresh store opened in Engadine. Previous Franklins Big Fresh, No Frills and Fresh logos. By the mid-1990s, Franklins supermarkets comprised five main chains: *Franklins No Frills: Sold No Frills brand dry groceries and perishables in mid-sized discount supermarkets. Similar chains: Woolworths' Food For Less, Jewel. *Franklins Mini Fresh: Sold fresh food and dry groceries in smaller convenience stores. Similar chains: Woolworths Metro, Coles Express (now Coles Central), IGA Express, 4 Square (now Eziway). *Franklins Fresh: Sold fresh food and dry groceries in mid-sized discount supermarkets. Similar chains: BI-LO, Flemings, IGA, Friendly Grocer, Dewsons. *Franklins Big Fresh: Full-service food barn/supermarket similar to Coles and Woolworths but pitched as being a bit cheaper. Most of them also had attached \\"Liquor Save\\" outlets. Similar chains: Coles, Woolworths, BI-LO Mega Frrresh, Supa IGA, Action. *Liquor Save:Bottle shops attached to a supermarket. Similar chains: Woolworths Liquor, IGA Liquor, Liquorland. In 1998, Franklins launched its first advertisement on TV with its first slogan, \\"More in your trolley for less\\". It also trial converts selected \\"No Frills\\" stores to \\"Franklins Fresh\\" and installs environmentally friendly fluorescent lighting in these stores. First Choice, an alternative (and short-lived) generic product range, is also launched. Franklins, Franklins Fresh and Franklins Big Fresh also launched their websites that year. In 1999, Franklins opened new stores and upgraded former No Frills stores to Franklins Fresh stores and unveiled its new logo, which is still used today, though it was only in use at selected stores at first. Also due to the logo change, Franklins Fresh also unveiled a new logo. The \\"Liquor Save\\" outlets were also re-branded as Franklins Liquor (attached to selected No Frills and Fresh stores) or Big Fresh Liquor. It had also positioned itself by this time as the national discount supermarket operator. In 2000, Franklins sponsored the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games. It sold a range of Paralympic merchandise. By the end of 2000, there were 287 stores. ===Pick 'n Pay (2001‚Äì2010)=== In 2001, Franklins' mass expansion and reformatting ended in failure.\\"SMH.com.au news article, 19 April 2001.\\" Dairy Farm International exits from Australia in May, and many stores were sold to Woolworths (which got 67 stores), Coles (which got 20 stores), Foodland and IGA franchisees.\\"ACCC 22 May 2001.\\" A few closed. This saw the end of Franklins in the ACT, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. 86 stores across New South Wales were sold to South African retailer Pick 'n Pay, which also bought the Franklins name. The \\"No Frills\\", \\"Fresh\\" and \\"Mini Fresh\\" brands survived. \\"Big Fresh\\" did not and nearly all were bought by Woolworths and Coles. Pick 'n Pay bought all but one of the 21 Fresco supermarkets and rebranded them as Franklins stores at the same time. The other was shut down. The new Franklins launched the \\"Saves You Money\\" slogan. In January Aldi launched in NSW, and quickly filled the void left by Franklins in many areas. In 2002, Foodland Associated Limited bought 36 Franklins stores across Queensland and Northern NSW as well as its Queensland warehouse facilities. All were rebranded as Action supermarkets. This saw the end for the \\"Mini Fresh\\" brand. The \\"Fresh\\" and \\"No Frills\\" brands were also retired, although their formats remain. All stores more than 2000 square metres are effectively \\"Fresh\\" stores. Franklins was relaunched with the slogan \\"Look at us now!\\". In 2003, Franklins changed its slogan to \\"That's what I like about Franklins!\\". It also announced that it is not interested in owning petrol stations like most of its competitors. Later that year, the \\"No Frills\\" generic product range and the brand itself is revamped and then promoted by its new mascot, \\"Red Sock\\". In 2004, the Franklins website was relaunched and Franklins joined the widespread trend of selling green plastic carrier bags. The fourth Pick 'n Pay era slogan was launched ‚Äì \\"Cheap and Cheerful\\". The liquor outlets were relaunched as Franklins Local Liquor, in addition to the Canberra-based liquor chain. The annual \\"Birthday Cash Jackpot\\" competition is also introduced. In 2005, Franklins started setting up franchise opportunities under the \\"Franklins Family Supermarkets\\" brand (similar to the \\"Pick 'n Pay Family Supermarkets\\" brand). By that time, there were 80 Franklins supermarkets across New South Wales. The only Franklins store to open that year was the one in Newcastle. The Franklins store in Erina Fair on the Central Coast was also closed, soon replaced by Aldi. On 30 January 2006, Franklins opened a purchased store in Ulladulla NSW to show potential franchisees the benefits of changing from IGA to Franklins. Also in 2006, Franklins launched its own loyalty club and begins changing a few stores to the franchise model. There were 77 Franklins stores by the end of 2006. In 2007, some new stores were opened. Two existing Franklins stores and another two IGA stores were converted to Franklins Family supermarkets. By the end of 2007 there were 80 Franklins stores. On 1 July 2010, it was announced that all 85 stores Franklins had been sold to Metcash for A$215 million, to become part of the IGA chain. The stores will be sold individually to independent retailers. Franklins' last store was located at Westfield Miranda, this being the final Franklins in Australia closed in April 2015.http://www.theleader.com.au/story/2982242/final-checkout-franklins- leaves-westfield-miranda/ ==Advertising== Historically, Franklins never advertised due to it being a \\"no-frills\\" supermarket. Instead, it advertised specials at the stores, much like Aldi does now. Later, it advertised through their own catalogues, especially when it introduced fresh foods and liquor to its stores. In the early 1990s Franklins launched its first TV advertisement with the slogans \\"More in your trolley for less\\" and \\"Good ol' Prices are Back\\". Shortly after Dairy Farm International exited the business in 2001, Franklins' advertisements used the slogan \\"Saves You Money\\". In 2002, the new Franklins was launched with the slogan \\"Look at us now!\\". In 2003 it was changed to \\"That's what I like about Franklins!\\" and again in 2004 to \\"Cheap and Cheerful\\". That slogan is now rarely used, being largely replaced with and branded as \\"Australia's Original Discount Grocer\\". The No Frills generic product range was relaunched in 2003 and promoted by its mascot \\"Red Sock\\" on TV advertisements and on its website. \\"Red Sock\\" now appears once every so often in the regular advertising on TV, radio, newspapers and catalogues for Franklins. In late 2009 Franklins changed back to the 2002 slogan \\"Look at us now!\\". In 2011 the flash mobbing technique was used with shoppers and employees singing to promote Franklins during a time when Coles used their ever-popular \\"Down, Down, Prices Are Down\\" and price hand strategies. Woolworths also used flash mobbing and became accessible in all states and territories of Australia and during a time when Metcash, owners of the IGA brand ‚Äì which acquired Franklins the previous year ‚Äì began converting their stores to the IGA network. In 2012, the last year of Franklins as a separate chain in its own right, Franklins returned to using the Dairy Farm-era slogans \\"More in your trolley for less\\" and \\"Good ol' Prices are Back\\" in retro-style promotions alongside its Pick-n-Pay-era \\"Australia's Original Discount Grocer\\" slogan. The chain also joined the divisive $1 milk price wars along with Coles, Woolworths, Aldi and some IGA supermarkets. In the brand's final years, it was used in place of the IGA brand as the stores were being sold off. A second \\"Franklins Rewards\\" program was launched when only the store in Westfield Miranda remained. ==Generic productsNo Frills=== No Frills logo. No Frills was Franklins' generic range of products. Launched in 1978, it was the first such brand range in Australia, and changed supermarket shopping habits in Australia. Franklins stores initially changed the store's format to revolve around the brand, selling little else. The \\"No Frills\\" name was also used up until 2002 for the name of the format Franklins had used which is best known for selling dry groceries and frozen perishables only. Originally, the No Frills brand was only used for its peanut butter, honey and potato chips but has since expanded its range to more than 800 products in packaged groceries and perishables.\\"Franklins Supermarkets Australia website\\" In late 2003, the \\"No Frills\\" generic product range and the brand itself had been revamped and was promoted by its new mascot, \\"Red Sock\\". Sold with a money- back guarantee, in many cases they're market leaders in their categories. The No Frills logo was also used by former British discount retailer Kwiksave. The No Frills brand is also used by Woolworths New Zealand, Hong Kong supermarket and Dairy Farm International subsidiary Wellcome. ===First Choice=== Previous Franklins First Choice logo. First Choice was another generic range of products Franklins had sold. Launched in 1998, it was developed to provide an alternative to the leading brands and have products with quality equal to or better than the leading brands. The products didn't just have the quality but also had prices that were anywhere between 10‚Äì15% cheaper than the national brands. First Choice had over 600 different products, and new products were continually being developed every day. The brand did not survive for long, though, and by the time Dairy Farm International exited the company in 2001, the brand was dropped, unlike No Frills, which continues to be sold at IGAs to this day. The First Choice brand is still used by Hong Kong supermarket Wellcome. ==References * http://www.franklins.com.au Franklins Australia (dead link) *Franklins Online (pre-2001, location links work here) *Franklins Online (2001) *Dairy Farm Website ‚Äì Franklins Page (Early 2001) Category:Supermarkets of Australia Category:Companies based in Sydney Category:Discount stores of Australia Category:Retail companies established in 1941 Category:Retail companies disestablished in 2015 Category:Australian companies established in 1941 Category:2015 establishments in Australia Category:Australian grocers ","title":"Franklins"},{"id":"2230286","text":"Harry Parker (October 28, 1935June 25, 2013) was the head coach of the Harvard varsity rowing program (1963‚Äì2013). He also represented the United States in the single scull at the 1960 Summer Olympics. == Rowing career == Parker attended the University of Pennsylvania as an undergraduate, where he majored in Philosophy and learned rowing. Mentored by Pennsylvania's coach Joe Burk, Parker rowed on the 1955 Penn Varsity crew that won the Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. After college, Parker began to scull competitively. He won the single scull (one man boat) at the 1959 Pan American Games. In 1959, Parker also competed in the Diamond Scull event at the Henley Royal Regatta finishing second to six-time champion Stuart MacKenzie. In 1960, he won the U.S. Olympic trials in the single scull. At the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Parker made the finals and finished fifth. == Coaching career == During his training for the national team, Parker's name was forwarded to the athletic director at Harvard, Tom Bolles, who appointed the 27-year-old oarsman as the freshman coach in 1961. When Harvard's varsity coach, Harvey Love, died suddenly of a heart attack in the spring of 1963, Parker was promoted to the varsity level, purely on an interim basis. The crew had an uneven spring, and performed poorly at the Eastern Sprints (the league championship for the EARC). The annual highpoint of the Harvard rowing season is the Harvard-Yale race (the oldest and longest-running intercollegiate sporting event in the United States) held in June. Parker meticulously prepared his crew for their biggest race of the year. Heavy underdogs against the favored Yale crew, the Harvard varsity pulled off an upset. Parker was appointed permanent coach of the varsity crew. Harvard would not lose to Yale until 1981. Parker's success was immediate and unprecedented. His crews won the Eastern Sprints every year between 1964 and 1970. Parker coached a Harvard four man boat (4+) at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Parker and the Harvard crew made the cover of Sports Illustrated in 1965. Parker's crews won the 1967 Pan American Games, and finished second at the 1967 European Championships. Parker's 1968 crew earned the right to represent the United States at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City‚Äîthe last collegiate crew ever to do so. The Harvard 8 narrowly won the Olympic trials by 5/100th of a second over of a powerful University of Pennsylvania crew ‚Äì a race that pitted Parker against his mentor Joe Burk. In Mexico, one of Harvard's rowers became ill and had to be replaced. Harvard made the finals and finished sixth. Several members of the crew were involved in the political turmoil which swept over the games.\\"Olympics '68: The Politics of Hypocrisy\\". Harvard was the last non-national team crew to represent the United States in the Olympics in the 8+ man event. Until 1960, the United States, using a trial system where the best 8 man crew went to the Olympics, had won every gold medal. But the rest of the world had caught up and was surpassing the USA. In particular, Karl Adam and his Ratzeburg crews from West Germany had become the team to beat. (Parker was one of the first US coaches to adopt Adam's methods). In 1972, the NAAO, the then governing organization for rowing in the United States, put together a national camp system to help ensure that the best rowers were in the national boat. Parker was named head coach. With Parker at the helm and with numerous former Harvard oarsmen in the boat, Team USA finished second to New Zealand earning a silver medal in the 8+ at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. In the 1970s, Parker's Harvard crews continued to be successful. They did not win the Sprints in the years 1971‚Äì1973, but the losses were close. Then came the 1974 and 1975 Harvard varsities which are considered to be among the greatest in the history of the sport. They swept the collegiate competition, including dual races each year against the undefeated west coast champions Washington. Numerous team members went on to row for the national team. Post-season, the 1975 crew went to England to race at the Henley Royal Regatta. They finished second in the premier event of the regatta, the Grand Challenge Cup, losing to the British national team by two lengths. Parker was also a path-breaking coach: he was the first women's national team coach in 1975. That eight went on to win a silver medal at the World Rowing Championships (the so-called Red Rose Crew). Parker would go on to coach the USA women's eight (8+) at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal where they earned a Bronze medal. Parker's crews continued to be formidable in the mid and late 1970s, winning the Eastern Sprints in 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1980. But Yale was on the rise; it won the Eastern Sprints in 1978 and 1979 and beat Harvard in doing so. Still, Harvard continued to win the Harvard-Yale race. Parker ran his streak to 18 years. Finally, in 1981, Yale ended the streak and would go on to win the next three races. Harvard men's eight at Henley, 2004 In 1983, Harvard won the Eastern Sprints, and in one of the best collegiate races ever, snatched the inaugural National Collegiate Rowing Championship by coming from a length down with 500 meters to go and catching a super-fast Washington boat at the line. Parker's 1985 Harvard varsity ‚Äì after some early-season losses ‚Äì won the Eastern Sprints, the National Collegiate Rowing Championship and the Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. Through the late 1980s and early 1990s, Harvard continued to be a dominating presence in rowing. Parker's crews won the national championship in 1983, 1985, 1987, 1988, 1989 and 1992, and they were Eastern Sprints champions in 1988, 1989, and 1990. The national championship race was disbanded in 1996, following which the Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championship, also known as the IRA, became the de facto national championship. Harvard had never gone to the IRAs during Parker's tenure, but in 2003, after a decade of good showings but no championships, Parker's varsity won the Eastern Sprints and decided to go to the IRA, which they also won. They continued the streak by winning both the Eastern Sprints and the IRAs in 2004 and 2005. The 2004 crew may have been Harvard's fastest crew ever. National team crews are older and more experienced than college oarsmen, and are far better prepared than when Harvard raced in the 1968 Summer Olympics. Following the 2004 season, the Harvard varsity went to Europe, where it rowed in the World Cup in Lucerne which was a tune-up for most of the national teams competing in the Olympics. In an upset, Harvard made the finals at Lucerne by defeating the British and French Olympic squads. Harvard lost to the five national teams in the finals at Lucerne, which included four of the top six finishers at the Olympic games‚Äîbut they were competitive for the length of the course. Harvard then competed in the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley, losing in the finals to the Dutch Olympic 8+, which was also an Olympic finalist. Harry coached many entrances in the Henley Royal Regatta. His last attendance of the regatta, in 2012, saw his Varsity win by a foot over Leander in the Ladies' Plate. In 2013, two weeks after Harry's death, four members of his final varsity, coached by Bill Manning, broke the record in the Visitor's Challenge Cup. Parker has nine official (or quasi-official) national championships, which is the second most among active coaches. Parker's crews from the 1960s and 1970s won several unofficial titles. He completed 51 seasons at the helm, having confirmed his place as the most significant American coach of the latter half of the 20th century. == Harry Parker Boathouse == On September 10, 2008, Community Rowing, Inc. announced that it would name its new boathouse after Harry Parker.

It ended with their divorce in 1979. George Franklin Parker and David Lambert Parker were born during the 1960s. He later married Kathy Keeler, the stroke of the gold-medal winning USA Women's 8+ at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. They had a daughter named Abigail Parker. In 2011, Parker was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome. Former Freshmen coach Bill Manning was promoted to Associate Head Coach when Parker began treatment.

The squadron is permanently stationed at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island with a radio callsign of \\"Thunder\\". ==Early years== left Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron One Three Five was established on May 15, 1969, to provide electronic warfare and aerial refueling support to carrier air wings. It was stationed at Naval Air Station Alameda. The squadron first flew the EKA-3B Skywarrior and deployed to both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets. In 1973, VAQ-135 relocated to NAS Whidbey Island and transitioned to the Grumman EA-6B Prowler. The squadron first deployed with the EA-6B to the Western Pacific (WESTPAC) and the Indian Ocean from January to September 1976 with Carrier Air Wing 2 (CVW-2) aboard . Following that deployment, VAQ-135 transitioned to the Improved Capability Prowler (ICAP) and became the first fleet EA-6B ICAP squadron. The squadron deployed with Carrier Air Wing 8 (CVW-8) aboard from November 1977 to July 1978 to the Mediterranean Sea. In January 1979, VAQ-135 commenced refresher training with Carrier Air Wing 15 (CVW-15) aboard and deployed to the Western Pacific in May 1979. During deployment, they received the Navy Expeditionary Medal for operations in the Indian Ocean during the Iranian hostage crisis, the Meritorious Unit Commendation, and their first Chief of Naval Operations Safety ‚ÄúS‚Äù Award. They again deployed with CVW-15 aboard USS Kitty Hawk from April to November 1981. VAQ-135 participated in several major exercises throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans and received a second Navy Expeditionary Medal and the Humanitarian Service Medal for their participation in the rescue of Vietnamese boat people. ==1980s== In May 1982, VAQ-135 was assigned to and Carrier Air Wing 1 (CVW-1). After completing work- ups, the squadron was transferred to and deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in November 1982 later receiving their second Chief of Naval Operations Safety ‚ÄúS‚Äù Award. In 1984, the squadron deployed to USS America and CVW-1 from April until November 1984, receiving their third Chief of Naval Operations Safety ‚ÄúS‚Äù Award. In 1985, along with CVW-1 they participated in Ocean Safari ‚Äò85, the largest NATO naval exercise to date, and received their second Meritorious Unit Commendation. On the morning of January 1, 1986, VAQ-135 was deployed to support Sixth Fleet Battle Group operations in the Mediterranean Sea. Within 48 hours, they had sortied from NAS Whidbey Island, joined their new air wing Carrier Air Wing 13 (CVW-13) at sea on board and supported contingency operations underway in the central Mediterranean Sea. For the next five months, with no in-theater supply support, the squadron provided electronic warfare support to U.S. naval forces operating off the coast of Libya. The squadron took part in the successful strikes in the Gulf of Sidra in March 1986 and provided key close-support jamming services in the successful strikes on the Benina/Benghazi airfields in April of that year. As a result, the squadron was awarded two Navy Unit Commendations, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, the Navy Expeditionary Medal and the Association of Old Crows Outstanding Unit Award for 1986. In November 1986, the squadron was reassigned to Carrier Air Wing 11 (CVW-11) aboard . In 1987, VAQ-135 completed work-ups with CVW-11 and became the first Prowler squadron to complete the Medium Attack Advanced Readiness Program (MAARP) and the revised EA-6B Defensive Air Combat Maneuvering (DACM) syllabus. In January 1988, VAQ-135 became the first EA-6B squadron to deploy with five Prowlers. WESTPAC ‚Äò88 marked the return of the squadron to the Seventh Fleet with USS Enterprise, providing electronic warfare support to U.S. Naval forces operating in the North Arabian Sea. The squadron received the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal. In April 1988, VAQ-135 participated with CVW-11 and Battle Group Foxtrot in Operation Praying Mantis, the successful action against Iranian naval surface units. The command received the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, Meritorious Unit Commendation, and Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal. In the fall of 1988, the squadron transitioned to the ICAP-II version of the Prowler, acquiring the ability to fire the AGM-88 High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile. In September 1989, VAQ-135 deployed aboard Enterprise for an around the world cruise, taking part in PACEX ‚Äò89, the largest naval exercise since World War II. In January 1990, the squadron participated in Operation Earnest Will in defense of the Philippine government, resulting in the command receiving the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal. ==1990s== In September 1990, the squadron deployed aboard . Their two-month maiden voyage took them from Naval Station Norfolk around Cape Horn to Abraham Lincolns new homeport of NAS Alameda, California. In May 1991, they deployed to the Western Pacific aboard Abraham Lincoln and participated in Operation Fiery Vigil, the evacuation of Air Force and Navy personnel from Naval Base Subic Bay, Philippines. While on station in the Persian Gulf, the squadron took part in Operation Desert Storm, Exercise Beacon Flash with Oman and annual exercise operations with the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Forces. In February 1992, the squadron received the 1991 AIRPAC Safety \\"S\\" award in recognition of the squadron‚Äôs outstanding safety record of over 12 years and 21,000 hours mishap free. In late 1992, the squadron started another work-up cycle for their second deployment on Abraham Lincoln and participated in the squadron‚Äôs first AGM-88 shot over the desert skies of Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake. On June 15, 1993, they deployed to the Western Pacific participating in Operation Southern Watch, enforcing the southern no-fly zone in Iraq where they shot two AGM-88s to protect air wing aircraft from an enemy surface to air missiles and received their second Southwest Asia Service Medal. In addition, the squadron participated in Operation Restore Hope, while USS Abraham Lincoln was stationed off the coast of Somalia, receiving the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal. In November 1993, the squadron celebrated another safety milestone, fourteen years mishap free, just prior to returning home to NAS Whidbey Island. In April 1995, VAQ-135 deployed to the Western pacific on board Abraham Lincoln participating in Exercise Inspired Alert with the Pakistan Air Force, Exercise Nautical Artist, an exercise with the Royal Saudi Air Force and Saudi Navy and Operation Southern Watch, receiving their third Southwest Asia Service Medal. The squadron returned from deployment and started a 12-month turnaround aboard USS Kitty Hawk participating in RIMPAC 96'. The squadron deployed in October 1996 and again participated in Operation Southern Watch receiving their fourth Southwest Asia Service Medal. After returning from deployment in April 1997, the squadron participated in several exercises including Exercise Red Flag. In February 1998 the squadron was re-designated Electronic Attack Squadron 135, and the aircraft‚Äôs side numbers were changed to 500 series. During the summer of 1998, the squadron deployed aboard and participated in RIMPAC ‚Äô98. The squadron deployed to the Western Pacific in November 1998, participating in Operation Southern Watch and Operation Desert Fox, a four-day campaign consisting of several air strikes. The squadron fired two AGM-88‚Äôs supporting air wing strike aircraft. The squadron returned from deployment in May 1999. In September 1999, the squadron participated in exercises Red Flag and Spirit Hawk in preparation for their deployment to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey in August 2000. ==2000s== VAQ-135 EA-6B Prowler prepares to land aboard USS Nimitz after returning from a mission in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. From May through July 2000, the squadron flew missions in support of Operation Northern Watch on station at Incirlik Air Base while supporting in a Joint Expeditionary role for Commander Electronic Attack Wing U.S. Pacific Fleet. In March 2001, the squadron deployed to the Western Pacific in support of Operation Southern Watch. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, USS Carl Vinson and CVW-11 took station off of the coast of Pakistan and conducted air strikes in support of coalition air and ground forces in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom. The squadron returned home in January 2002 and received the Chief of Naval Operations Safety \\"S\\" Award, Battle Efficiency Award and the Old Crows Award as the most tactically proficient Prowler squadron. In March 2003, they deployed aboard USS Nimitz and participated in the initial air strikes of the Iraq War. Following an extended eight-month deployment, supporting two separate contingency operations, the squadron returned home in November 2003. In July 2004, the squadron participated in Joint Expeditionary Force Experiment (JEFX) at Nellis Air Force Base, the first of five 2004 detachments in preparation for the 2005 WESTPAC deployment. The squadron completed 2004 with a two-month detachment aboard Nimitz for TSTA/Computex and received the CVW-11 Golden Wrench for maintenance excellence. In 2005, they continued their high-tempo operations in preparation for their WESTPAC deployment with detachments to NAS Fallon, NAS Lemoore, NAS North Island, and several exercises aboard USS Nimitz. VAQ-133 EA-6B flies near left On May 7, 2005, the squadron deployed aboard USS Nimitz as part of Carrier Strike Group 11. During the 2005 deployment, VAQ-135 conducted operations in the Western Pacific and the Persian Gulf, again participating in Operation Iraqi Freedom from the Persian Gulf and Al Asad Air BaseIinraq, providing support to coalition forces in Iraq. The squadron received the CVW-11 /USS Nimitz Teamwork Award twice during the deployment, initially for the first line period and again at the end of the deployment. Additionally, VAQ-135 received the CVW-11 Golden Wrench Award for deployment, as the finest Maintenance Department in CVW-11. The squadron departed in April 2007, for a six-month WESTPAC deployment to include supporting both Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, returning in early October 2007. The squadron returned from a subsequent Pacific deployment in June 2008 after a four-and-a- half-month deployment aboard USS Nimitz. The squadron departed July 2009, for an eight-month WESTPAC deployment, aboard USS Nimitz, in support of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. == 2010s == EA-18G (No.166942) of VAQ-135.

On 9 December 1940 he replaced Admiral Inigo Campioni as commander of the entire battle fleet of the Regia Marina, with flag on the battleship Vittorio Veneto. On 9 February 1941, Iachino led the Italian fleet in the unsuccessful pursuit of the British Force H, after the latter had bombarded Genoa and La Spezia. He again commanded the Italian battle fleet in the Battle of Cape Matapan (26-29 March 1941), which resulted in the biggest defeat ever suffered by the Regia Marina; dismissing reports of nearby British battleships as incorrect or exaggerated, he sent the entire 1st Cruiser Division to the rescue of the stricken cruiser Pola, resulting in the annihilation of the entire Division by the three battleships of Admiral Andrew Browne Cunningham's Mediterranean Fleet. His actions during this battle have been the subject of much criticism since then;Giorgerini, op. cit., pp. 315‚Äì321 despite this, Iachino wasn't relieved of command. In July and September 1941 Iachino led the fleet in fruitless attempts to intercept British convoys to Malta (Operation Substance and Operation Halberd). During the First Battle of Sirte (16 December 1941) and the Second Battle of Sirte (22 March 1942) the forces under his command clashed with the escorts of British convoys heading for Malta, but despite his superior strength Iachino ‚Äì concerned about not underestimating the enemy forces (to the point of believing incorrect reports about nonexistent battleships) and avoiding night action, both of which had been his fatal mistakes at Matapan ‚Äì did not press the attack and was unable to cause significant damage to the convoys. Operation Vigorous (12-16 June 1942; known in Italy as the \\"Battle of Mid June\\") was instead his most important success; despite the losses caused by air and submarine attacks (the battleship Littorio was torpedoed, and the heavy cruiser Trento was sunk), he kept advancing towards the British convoy sailing from Alexandria to Malta, eventually leading to it aborting its mission and turning back to port. On 5 April 1943 Iachino was replaced by Admiral Carlo Bergamini as the commander of the Italian battle fleet. At the same time he was promoted to Ammiraglio d'Armata. In 1945 he was transferred to the reserve, but he appealed against this and was restored to active service in 1948. He finally left active service in 1954 and was discharged in 1962. During his later years he wrote several books about his actions during the war, especially focusing on Matapan and trying to justify his actions in that battle. In 1974 he donated the money for the construction of a Sailor's Monument in Taranto. He died in Rome on 3 December 1976, at the age of 87. ==NotesReferences== *B.P Boschesi, Cento Protagonisti della Seconda Guerra Mondiale *Giorgio Giorgerini, La guerra italiana sul mare : la marina tra vittoria e sconfitta 1940‚Äì1943, Mondadori 2002, Category:1889 births Category:1976 deaths Category:People from Sanremo Category:Italian military personnel of World War I Category:Regia Marina personnel of World War II Category:Italian admirals Category:Italian military personnel of the Spanish Civil War ","title":"Angelo Iachino"},{"id":"2230293","text":"Looc is the name of two places in the Philippines: *Looc, Occidental Mindoro *Looc, Romblon *Looc, Mandaue City LOOC may refer to: *Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee ","title":"Looc"},{"id":"2230294","text":"Magdiwang may refer to the following: *Magdiwang (Katipunan faction), a faction of the 19th century Philippine revolutionary group Katipunan. *Magdiwang, Romblon, a Philippine municipality *Magdiwang Party, a political party in 21st century Philippines ","title":"Magdiwang"},{"id":"2230298","text":"Miko≈Çaj Kamieniecki h.

In addition to its flagship supermarket chain, the company operated several subsidiaries across the country. The company went bankrupt in 1992, three years after being sold to private interests, after 75 years in business. ==Beginning== Steinberg's began as a grocery store founded in 1917 in Montreal by Jewish-Hungarian immigrant, Ida Steinberg. Her five sons, led by Sam Steinberg, grew the company from a tiny storefront on St. Lawrence Boulevard into the most popular and largest supermarket chain in Quebec. It was the first to create the \\"supermarket\\" concept in Quebec, in 1934, with expansions into Ontario (primarily the Ottawa area) and parts of New Brunswick.\\"Steinberg Inc.\\". The Canadian Encyclopedia ==Expansion== Steinberg's opened more stores in Montreal and Quebec over the years. Steinberg's entered the real estate market in 1952 under the name Ivanhoe Investments and owned several shopping centres. During the expansion years, the plan was to landbank properties in Quebec for future development into shopping centres and stores. Ivanhoe turned out to be one of Steinberg's most profitable ventures and continues today under the name Ivanhoe Cambridge. Steinberg's also had holdings in food production and distribution. In keeping with increasing French language pressures in Quebec, Steinberg's dropped the possessive \\"'s\\" from its name to become \\"Steinberg\\" in 1961. This was accompanied with the introduction of a new logo as shown above this article (the previous logo had consisted of Sam Steinberg's personal signature). Despite the change, the chain continued to be referred to as \\"Steinberg's\\" among the English-speaking public and media throughout its history and beyond. Sam Steinberg For several decades, and until the late 1980s, Steinberg's was the largest supermarket chain in the province of Quebec. Store outlets could be spotted in nearly every district of the island of Montreal and was a major competitor for chains like Provigo and Metro. Sam Steinberg was one of the first employers to implement mandatory bilingualism (English and French) for all his personnel and as a result, the company became so entrenched in Quebec culture that among French speakers, \\"Je fais mon Steinberg\\" (\\"I'm doing my Steinberg's\\") became a synonym for going grocery shopping, regardless of supermarket chain. In 1959, Steinberg's made its expansion west of Ottawa into Ontario by acquiring 38 Ontario stores that Grand Union had put up for sale. This formed the basis of Steinberg's Ontario division. Until Loblaws expanded into Quebec through acquisition, there had been an unspoken agreement between Steinberg's and Loblaws that one would not enter the other's market. What Steinberg's found was that the locations of many of the Grand Union stores they acquired were in less-than-ideal locations compared to their already established competitors, and over time most were closed or relocated to new stores. The Ontario stores lost money because of competition, poor locations, and the imposition of a Quebec style of management and retailing that did not suit the Ontario market. The branding of Steinberg's Ontario's supermarkets was changed in the late 1960s to Miracle Food Marts outside of eastern Ontario, some operating next to a Miracle Mart department store. A new food and drug store chain, Miracle Ultra-Mart stores, was introduced in the mid-1980s. The main warehousing and administrative offices were in Rexdale (Etobicoke, now part of Toronto). The Ottawa, Cornwall and Brockville stores were part of the Quebec division rather than the Ontario division. At one point a hypermarket was introduced called Steinberg Beaucoup, which consisted of a Steinberg's grocery, a Miracle Mart department store and Le Quick and Pik-Nik restaurants, all under the same roof. In Ontario, they were opened as \\"Miracle Beaucoup\\" stores with Miracle Food Mart as the grocery store. The first two Beaucoup stores were opened in Laval, Quebec, and Bramalea, Ontario Steinberg's owned and operated several well-known businesses aside from their own name-brand supermarket chain: *Miracle Mart, established in 1961. A discount department store chain (led by daughter Mitzi and renamed \\"M\\" store), carried clothing, toys, household appliances and goods. The \\"M\\" department stores, poor performers since they were opened as Miracle Marts, ceased operations shortly after Steinberg's went bankrupt. *Miracle Food Mart, a supermarket chain operating in the Ontario regions where there were no stores of the grocery chain Steinberg's (they had been rebranded as such starting in 1969). Ontario operations had been poor in early years, but by the time they were sold to A&P; Canada they were one of the more valuable assets remaining in the company. *Valdi, a limited assortment (discount) grocery chain in Ontario and the western provinces, Valdi was founded in 1979. *Pik- Nik, launched as drive-in restaurants, and popular snack-bars operating in shopping malls, established in 1966. *Le Quick, a restaurant chain, also often located in malls with a Steinberg store. *Cardinal Distributors, a mail-order gift catalogue, that merged in 1979 with Consumers Distributing *Smitty's Super Value Inc., a small Arizona-based supermarket chain, acquired 1981. *Xtra, a briefly-operated discount supermarket chain introduced around 1990. *Ivanhoe Inc, their real estate and development arm. With its vast real estate portfolio, it was the most valuable asset in the company by the time it was sold off. *Steinberg Foods Limited, the company's own Montreal bakery and food production facilities, established in 1966. *Trillium Meats, Steinberg's own meat wholesaling company *Cartier Refined Sugars Limited, established in 1963. Steinberg's acquired a large stake in 1966 and eventually acquired the company. In addition, Steinbergs had partial ownership of: *Price Club, a popular American wholesale club store. Steinberg was the exclusive operator in Canada of the chain starting in 1985, and also owned a 50% stake in the company. *Lantic Sugar, owned a 50% stake via sale of Cartier Sugar in 1981. *Phoenix Mills Inc, a large flour mill, Steinberg's acquired 30% ownership in the late 1960s. ==Decline== A few signs of Steinberg's past remain, such as this logo on the floor at the entrance of a former store in Montreal which is now operated by the Metro supermarket chain. Trouble started brewing for the chain after the death of Sam Steinberg in 1978; his laissez-faire dealings with the union and lack of a succession plan for the company began its decline, and resulted in a trend of higher unionized labour costs than other unionized and non-union supermarkets, and a general loss of direction of the company without its former leader. Things worsened rapidly when a power struggle developed between his daughter Mitzi, her husband Mel Dobrin, daughter Marilyn Steinberg Cobrin and daughter Evelyn Steinberg. Each held equal controlling shares in the company through trusts, but these shares and those of their mother Helen, were stipulated to be voted together as one, to keep control of the company in the family. After a number of years under lackluster leadership, Irving Ludmer became CEO in April 1984. Ludmer was a former Steinberg's real estate vice president who worked with the company from 1957 until leaving NB to start his own real-estate company in 1971. He tried to reinvigorate the company and give it some direction following the chaotic years since Sam's death. He had rejoined real-estate branch Ivanhoe in 1983, and had become close to Sam during his early years at the company. He initiated sweeping changes throughout the company, resulting in improved sales, stock prices, and a general all-around improvement in Steinberg's, making it more attractive on the stock market. By the end of the 1980s, family infighting, power struggles, rising costs and increased competition were taking their toll, and Steinberg's was placed on the auction block for an estimated $1.5 billion. The Ontario-based Loblaws chain attempted to acquire Steinberg's, but was blocked by the Quebec provincial government on nationalist grounds. Other potential buyers included Toronto-based Oxdon Investments, Oxford Development, Metro-Richelieu, Provigo, and a leveraged buyout from company executives Irving Ludmer and Arnold Steinberg. In the end, the company was sold for $1.3 billion on August 22, 1989 to a joint bid between Socanav (a marine shipping firm with no experience in retail, and whose major shareholder Michel Gaucher helped set up the deal) and the Caisse de d√©p√¥t et placement du Qu√©bec, Quebec's pension-fund manager. Under Socanav's ownership, Steinberg's ran some locations as franchises for the first time. Smaller Quebec grocery chains such as Metro-Richelieu and IGA had used a franchising model for some time. The company could save on labour costs, as those stores could employ non-unionized labour paid at lower wages than Steinberg's company-operated stores. M stores logo ==End of Steinberg's== The buyout of Steinberg's was highly leveraged. Despite improved profitability and cash flow results from Steinberg's after the buyout, various parts of the company were auctioned off by new owner Socanav to help pay down the heavy debt load incurred. The Caisse de d√©p√¥t et placement du Qu√©bec wanted Steinberg's real estate arm Ivanhoe for its attractive portfolio from the start, and acquired it for $887 million in 1990. Steinberg's 50% stakes in both Lantic Sugar and Price Club were sold in 1990 for $110 million and $58 million respectively. After ongoing talks, A&P; Canada agreed to buy the Ontario operations (consisting of 58 Miracle Food Marts, 11 Miracle Ultra- Marts, and Ontario divisional offices in Etobicoke) in July 1990 for $235 million, with the closing date of October 20, 1990. The stores continued to operate under their former names, but were eventually rebranded under the \\"A&P;\\" and \\"Dominion\\", and Ultra Mart/Ultra Food & Drug banners. The final 10 Ontario stores in the Ottawa, Cornwall and Brockville locations (not included in the sale to A&P; since they were all part of the Quebec division) were bought by Loblaws (under National Grocer Co.) in January 1992 and either converted to \\"Loblaws\\" or \\"Your Independent Grocer\\" banners, or closed. The sale included two operating as Xtra discount supermarkets. Those were the final stores Steinberg's owned in Ontario, aside from 74 Valdi stores that the chain held onto (a combined 101 in Ontario & Quebec). Valdi Foods remained a company subsidiary until the stores in the western provinces were closed in 1991/92. Attempts to sell off more assets and restructure the company (including rebranding some stores and franchising others) were difficult, due to Steinberg's higher labour wages, the 1990‚Äì1992 recession, suppliers unsure of supplying the highly leveraged company, pressure from creditors, mounting losses and interest payments on debt from the leveraged buyout. In May 1992, court protection was obtained in order to liquidate the company and pay off creditors. Loblaw again attempted to buy the chain. They were again foiled by the Quebec government, who arranged for Steinberg's stores to be sold to its two major local competitors Metro Richelieu and Provigo. To avoid accusations of monopoly, Metro and Provigo sold some Steinberg's stores to The Oshawa Group (IGA). By June 1992, Steinberg's and its poor-performing department store chain M began phased out. The Steinberg's stores were absorbed and converted by its competitors, while the M locations closed outright as no buyer could be found for them. The last Steinberg's stores closed on September 5, 1992. Although Steinberg's, Miracle Mart/M, Miracle Food Mart, Valdi and Cardinal Distributors are now defunct, Sam Steinberg is survived by his real estate company Ivanhoe (which absorbed Cambridge Shopping Centres Ltd in 2001 to become Ivanhoe Cambridge). His restaurant chain Pik-Nik, founded in 1966, lasted until the mid-2010s. Succession for the Steinberg's grocery chain was the subject of a 1974 National Film Board of Canada documentary by Arthur Hammond entitled After Mr. Sam. ==See also== *Corporation (TV series), about the Steinberg's chain *List of Canadian supermarkets ==References== * * The Canadian Encyclopedia - Steinberg Inc.

Closely related to other ethnic studies disciplines such as African-American studies, Asian American studies, and Native American studies, Latino studies critically examines the history, culture, politics, issues, and experiences of Hispanic people. Drawing from numerous disciplines such as sociology, history, literature, political science, religious studies and gender studies, Latino studies scholars consider a variety of perspectives and employ diverse analytical tools in their work. ==Origins of Latino studies== In academia, Latino Studies stemmed from the development of Chicana/o Studies and Puerto Rican Studies programs in response to demands articulated by student movements in the late 1960s in the United States. These movements unfolded amid a nationwide climate of heightened social and political activism, incited by opposition to the Vietnam War, the American Feminist movement, and the Civil Rights Movement. At some institutions of higher education in the United States, the 1970s and 1980s saw the consolidation of Latino Studies as an autonomous discipline while other institutions chose to maintain Chicano and Puerto Rican Studies programs‚Äîreflecting a diversity of institutional responses to the nascent academic discipline. Debates on the academic and institutional location of Latino Studies continue to present day: while some scholars strive to maintain Chicano and Puerto Rican Studies programs that explore the exceptionality of national experiences, in the context of a globalizing Latino diaspora and diversifying Latino student populations at U.S. universities, many others support the notion of Latino Studies as an \\"umbrella\\" field designed to explore pan-Latino experiences and histories that transcend nation-bound analytical frameworks introduced by pioneering Chicano and Puerto Rican studies programs. Yet others advocate for the absorption of Latino Studies into broader comparative disciplines such as ethnic studies, American studies, and Latin American Studies. Accordingly, the status of Latino Studies significantly differs from institution to institution in terms of nomenclature, pedagogical practice, and disciplinary location‚Äîwith examples ranging from degree-granting autonomous departments to interdisciplinary (and multidisciplinary) programs to university-affiliated research centers. === Chicano Studies === The first Chicano Studies program was established at California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA) in Fall 1968 in response to demands articulated by student activism movements. Initially named the Mexican American Studies Program, the program was instituted at CSULA as the Chicano Studies Department in 1971. Similar initiatives developed simultaneously at other California universities. In 1969 at a statewide conference held at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Chicano students, activists and scholars drafted the Plan de Santa B√°rbara a 155-page manifesto for the implementation of Chicano Studies in institutions of higher education in California. While the Regents of the University of California did not formally adopt the manifesto as an institutional mandate, it served as a blueprint for the establishment of Chicano Studies programs across public universities in the state. However, in calling for the establishment of comprehensive Chicano Studies programs‚Äîincluding departments, research centers, a Chicano studies library‚Äîand recommending the adoption of a host of institutional practices, many California universities implemented only certain elements of the plan. While Chicano studies programs proliferated across campuses in California, Texas-based institutions also played pivotal roles in development of early Chicano Studies programs, including the Center for Mexican American Studies at the University of Texas at Austin in 1970 and the Center for Mexican American Studies (CMAS) at the University of Texas at Arlington founded in 1993. === Puerto Rican Studies === In 1969, a parallel wave of student activism took place at City University of New York (CUNY) south campus, spearheaded by the efforts of Puerto Rican and African American Students. These efforts culminated in the spring of 1969 when students staged the Open Admissions Strike. The students' central demand was the adoption of a non-competitive open admissions policy. The expanded admissions policy would, in effect, diversify the student body by guaranteeing placement at CUNY for all New York City high school graduates. In addition to demands for an open-admissions policy, student activists demanded academic programs in Black and Puerto Rican Studies. In response, CUNY created the Department of Urban and Ethnic Studies. With continuing student activism, the Department of Puerto Rican Studies was formed in 1971, followed by the establishment of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies as a university-based research institute in 1973. Student activism related to the demand for Puerto Rican Studies was not limited to CUNY, and effervesced across New York public campuses including Brooklyn, Lehman, Queens and Bronx Community Colleges. == New directions in Latino Studies == As Chicano and Puerto Rican Studies programs stemmed largely (but not exclusively) from the east and west coasts, institutions in the American Midwest pioneered some of the first academic departments with a multinational or transnational Latino Studies focus. These programs included the Center for Chicano-Boricua Studies at Wayne State University (established in 1972) and the Chicano-Borique√±o Studies Program (now the Latino Studies Program) at Indiana University (established in 1976). Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, dozens of universities across the country followed suit and established academic programs and departments (see list of major departments) in Latino Studies. The 1980s and 1990s also saw the emergence of a number of research initiatives and professional societies dedicated to the advancement of a Latino Studies research agenda. These initiatives including fellowships offered by the Ford, Rockefeller, Compton and Mellon Foundations and the establishment of research institutes including The InterUniversity Project on Latino Research, the Tom√°s Rivera Policy Institute and the Julian Samora Research Institute. == Debate on the location of Latino Studies within institutions of higher education == The location of Latino Studies within institutions of higher education‚Äîin terms of disciplinary boundaries, but also with regard to the field's perceived legitimacy as an academic discipline and field of scholarship‚Äîis contested. === Criticisms of Latino Studies and Ethnic Studies === While Latino Studies is sometimes encompassed under the umbrella of ethnic studies, it is important to note that the discipline's course of development in different areas of the United States has been shaped by regional demographics, including the demographic composition of a college campus' student body. In the case of Latino Studies, the American northeast and southwest have served as especially salient battlegrounds for these debates to unfold. Staunch critics of ethnic studies programs include Ward Connerly, former University of California Regent, who was involved in the successful effort to ban affirmative action in California places of employment and higher education in 1996 with California Proposition 209. Connerly accused ethnic studies programs of being \\"divisive\\" and balkanizing. More recently, Latino Studies faced legal challenges in Arizona with House Bill 2120 which (echoing the Arizona ban on ethnic studies effectuated in Tucson public schools in 2011) sought to prohibit public universities in the state from activities and classes including those that \\"promote division, resentment or social justice toward a race, gender, religion, political affiliation, social class or other class of people\\"; \\"are designed primarily for students of a particular ethnic group\\"; or \\"advocate solidarity or isolation based on ethnicity, race, religion, gender or social class instead of the treatment of students as individuals.\\" (On January 17, 2017 Arizona House Education Committee Chairman Paul Boyer denied a hearing, effectively killing the bill.) === Disciplinary positioning of Latino Studies === Among scholars and administrators in support of Latino Studies and other ethnic studies programs, opinions are divided on the positioning, status and definition of Latino Studies within institutions of higher education. These debates arise from theoretical and epistemological inquiry but also from concerns surrounding funding and institutional support for university departments and academic programs. In the late 1990s, at the height of tensions between nationally- specific programs like Chicano Studies and Puerto Rican Studies and nascent pan-Latino Studies programs, Ignacio Garcia (Professor of Western American Studies at Brigham Young University) advocated for the autonomous departmental status of Chicano Studies‚Äîposing the emergence of Latino Studies as a challenge to that ideal. In his 1996 essay \\"Juncture in the Road: Chicano Studies since 'El Plan de Santa Barbara\\", Garcia argued: > Many centers find themselves challenged by non- Chicano Latino scholars who > want to promote their scholarly interests. They argue that all Latino groups > have a common experience with racism and poverty in American society. Also, > programs which emphasize the inclusive Hispanic approach are more likely to > gain research and support funds more easily. Because immigration has been a > major area of study for Chicano Studies and because the immigrant groups are > now more diverse among numerous Latino groups, there is an intellectual > challenge to Chicano Studies to become inclusive or else to be seen as > shallow and exclusionary. At the turn of the 21st century, scholars including Frances Aparicio (Professor of Spanish and Portuguese and Director of the Latina and Latino Studies Program at Northwestern University), Pedro Cab√°n (Professor and Chair of the Department of Latin American, Caribbean & U.S. Latino Studies at SUNY Albany), and Juan Flores (former Professor of Social and Cultural Analysis and Director of Latino Studies at New York University)‚Äîargued in support of an interdisciplinary Latino Studies field of scholarship with a transnational focus. In his 1999 essay \\"New Concepts, New Contexts,\\" Juan Flores‚Äîan advocate for the freestanding autonomy of Latino Studies departments‚Äîdescribed the potential \\"dilution\\" or \\"distortion\\" of the field when subsumed into umbrella departments. Flores identified that at a time when many public universities were being consolidated, Latino Studies programs were blossoming at private universities across the country. Nonetheless, recognizing political and pragmatic concerns, Flores recommended that departmental status should be evaluated on a \\"case-by-case\\" basis in order to best place the discipline according to the needs and demands of a particular institutional environment. Pedro Cab√°n considered the tensions and contradictions between Latino Studies as a discipline borne from student activism and institutional demands placed upon the discipline, writing: > If deployed uncritically, the Latino label can result in sanitizing a > history of political activism and critical engagement that is the legacy of > the struggles of the 1960s ... if Latino Studies programs are to be > successful and relevant to legions of students, they will need to retain the > normative values that defined their transformative goals, and obtain the > academic authority that traditional disciplines possess (hiring, promotion > and tenure, curriculum development, discretion over budgets, etc.) Reflecting upon Latino Studies programs existent in 1999, Aparicio warned that the ideal of interdisciplinarity is often unfulfilled, arguing that Latino Studies programs are often multidisciplinary aggregates of nationally-bounded scholarship: \\"Latino studies programs are constituted by a list of courses discrete in their national and disciplinary boundaries that add up to lo latino.\\" == Theoretical influences == Early Chicano Studies and Puerto Rican Studies programs developed in a parallel fashion: both emerged from activist struggles, developed within nation-bound analytical frameworks and drew influences from economic liberation, antiracism, and critical consciousness theories. However, Pedro Cab√°n argues that the two schools of thought differed in one significant way: \\"Whereas the Chicano historiography and the emerging social science literature primarily explored the Chicano experience in the US, early Puerto Rican Studies was heavily invested in reinterpreting the economic history of Puerto Rico under US colonial domination.\\" In the 1980s and 1990s, newly formed Latino Studies programs tended to emphasize interdisciplinarity and transnationalism. A number of pre-existing programs were restructured, consolidated or renamed to encompass this broader scope. Scholars in the field have identified the 1990s as a turning point in the discipline's history, as scholarship shifted away from \\"male-centered nationalistic discourse\\" and became increasingly influenced by intersectional identity formation theory, including feminist and queer theory. == List of scholarly and academic journals == * The Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education (founded 1990) * El Andar: A National Magazine for Latino Discourse (founded 1998) * Journal of Hispanic Higher Education (founded 2002) * Journal of Latinos and Education (founded 2002) * Latino Studies (founded 2003) * Journal of Latino-Latin American Studies, formerly Latino Studies Journal (founded 2005) * Latino(a) Research Review (founded 1995; publication suspended since 2010) * Journal of Latina/o Psychology (founded 2012) * CENTRO Journal (published continuously since 1987 by the Center for Puerto Rican Studies) == Major programs, departments and research institutes == The following is a working list of programs throughout the United States associated with \\"Latino Studies\\" in chronological order of establishment.

Increasingly, debate has focused on the differences rather than the similarities between other Ethnic studies disciplines such as African American studies, Asian American Studies, and Latino/a Studies. In particular, the political sovereignty of many indigenous nations marks substantive differences in historical experience from that of other racial and ethnic groups in the United States and Canada. Drawing from numerous disciplines such as anthropology, sociology, history, literature, political science, and gender studies, Native American studies scholars consider a variety of perspectives and employ diverse analytical and methodological tools in their work.Heitshu, Marshall (2009) Two key concepts shape Native American studies, according to Crow Creek Lakota scholar Elizabeth Cook-Lynn, indigenousness (as defined in culture, geography, and philosophy) and sovereignty (as legally and historically defined).Cook-Lynn (1997), p. 11 Practitioners advocate for decolonization of indigenous peoples, political autonomy, and the establishment of a discipline dedicated to alleviating contemporary problems facing indigenous peoples. ==History== The Native historical experience in the Americas is marked by forcible and sometimes willing attempts at assimilation into mainstream European American culture (Americanization). Beginning with missionaries and leading up to federally controlled schools, the aim was to educate American Indians so that they could go back to their communities and facilitate the assimilation process. As cited by David Beck in his article \\"American Indian Higher Education before 1974: From Colonization to Self-Determination,\\" the schools were used as a tool for assimilation. Their main focus was not intellectual but to give training for industrial jobs or domestic jobs. The Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s-1960s contested mainstream methods of assimilationist indoctrination and the substance of what was being taught in K-12 schools and universities throughout the United States. American Indian students, coupled with sympathetic professors, assisted in creating new programs with new aims. Rather than being focused on Indians going back to their communities to educate along the lines of assimilation there was a move to educate for empowerment. Programs that did community outreach and focused on student retention in campuses have risen out of that movement. Furthermore, the programs in schools created a new interpretation for American Indian history, sociology, and politics. During the First Convocation of American Indian Scholars in March 1970 at Princeton University, indigenous scholars drafted a plan to develop \\"Native American Studies as an Academic Disclipine,\\" which would defend indigenous control of their lands and indigenous rights and would ultimately reform US Indian Policy.Cook-Lynn (1997), p. 9 This discipline would be informed by traditional indigenous knowledge, especially oral history,Cook-Lynn (1997), p. 10 and would \\"defend indigenous nationhood in America.\\" In direct opposition to Western anthropology, the knowledge base of Native American studies is endogenous, or emerging from within the indigenous communities. Developers of Native American studies widely dismissed the notion of scientific objectivity, since Western cultural biases have historically informed anthropology and other disciplines. ==Academic journals== * American Indian Quarterly * American Indian Culture and Research Journal * Canadian Journal of Native Studies * European Review of Native American Studies * Native Studies Review * Studies in American Indian Literatures (SAIL) * W√≠ƒçazo ≈†a Review ==Conferences== *Native American Literature Symposium ==Notable scholars== *Taiaiake Alfred (Kanien‚Äôkehaka/Kahnawake Mohawk) *Paula Gunn Allen (Laguna Pueblo-Sioux) *Greg Cajete (Santa Clara Pueblo) *Dean Chavers (Lumbee) *Allison Hedge Coke (Huron-Muscogee Creek-Cherokee) *Elizabeth Cook-Lynn (Crow Creek Sioux) *Philip Deloria (Standing Rock Sioux) *Vine Deloria, Jr. (Standing Rock Sioux) *Raymond DeMallie *Jack D.

Born in Altdamm, Pomerania, (today DƒÖbie, district of Szczecin, Poland), Gilly was known as a prodigy and the teacher of the young Karl Friedrich Schinkel. In 1788 he enrolled at the Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste in Berlin. His teachers there included Carl Gotthard Langhans and Johann Gottfried Schadow. In 1797 Gilly travelled extensively in France, England, and Austria. The drawings he made in France reveal his interests in architecture and reflect the intellectual climate of the Directoire. They include views of the Fountain of Regeneration, the Rue des Colonnes‚Äîan arcaded street of baseless Doric columns leading to the Th√©√¢tre Feydeau‚Äîthe chamber of the Conseil des Anciens in the Tuileries and Jean-Jacques Rousseau‚Äôs grotto in its landscaped setting at Ermenonville, Oise. His 1797 design for the Frederick II monument reveals his debt to French neoclassicism, in particular Etienne-Louis Boull√©e, his explanatory notes indicate he intended the building to be spiritually uplifting. Beginning in 1799 Schinkel lived in the Gilly household at Berlin and was taught by Friedrich and Friedrich's architect father David Gilly. Gilly was appointed professor at the Berlin Bauakademie at the age of 26\\\\. Of his built designs, only one survives: the ruinous Greek Revival mausoleum (1800‚Äì02; mostly destr. after 1942) at Dyhernfurth near Breslau (now Brzeg Dolny near Wroc≈Çaw, Poland), in the form of a prostyle Greek temple.

In 1671 an argument broke out in the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in Paris about whether drawing or color was more important in painting. On one side stood the Poussinists (Fr. Poussinistes) who were a group of French artists, named after the painter Nicolas Poussin, who believed that drawing was the most important thing.Poussinist Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2014. Retrieved 27 March 2014. On the other side were the Rubenists (Fr. Rub√©nistes), named after Peter Paul Rubens, who prioritize color.Rubenist Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2014. Retrieved 27 March 2014. There was a strong nationalistic flavour to the debate as Poussin was French but Rubens was Flemish, though neither was alive at the time. After over forty years the final resolution of the matter in favor of the Rubenists was signalled when Antoine Watteau's The Embarkation for Cythera was accepted as his reception piece by the French Academy in 1717. By that time the French Rococo was in full swing. ==The argument== The Poussinists believed in the Platonic idea of the existence in the mind of ideal objects that could be reconstructed in concrete form by the selection, using reason, of elements from nature. For the Poussinists, therefore, color was a purely decorative addition to form and drawing (design or disegno), the use of line to depict form, was the essential skill of painting. Their leader was Charles Le BrunHonour, H. and J. Fleming, (2009) A World History of Art. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 609. (died 1690), Director of the Academy, and their heroes were Raphael, the Carracci, and Poussin himself, whose severe and stoical works exemplified their philosophy. Their touchstones were the forms of classical art. Hippopotamus Hunt, Rubens, 1616. They were opposed by the Rubenists who believed that colour, not drawing, was superior as it was more true to nature. Their models were the works of Rubens who had prioritised the accurate depiction of nature over the imitation of classical art. The Rubenists argued that the aim of painting was to deceive the eye by creating an imitation of nature. Drawing, according to the Rubenists, although based on reason, appealed only to a few experts whereas colour could be enjoyed by everyone. The ideas of the Rubenists therefore had revolutionary political connotations as they elevated the position of the lay person and challenged the idea that had held sway since the Renaissance that painting, as a liberal art, could only be appreciated by the educated mind.Janson, H.W. (1995) History of Art. 5th edn. Revised and expanded by Anthony F. Janson. London: Thames & Hudson, p. 604. In 1672, Charles Le Brun, Chancellor of the French Academy, attempted to halt the argument by stating officially that \\"the function of colour is to satisfy the eyes, whereas drawing satisfies the mind.\\" He failed, and the debate was continued in the pamphlets of Roger de Piles, who favoured the colourists and set out the arguments in his 1673 Dialogue sur le Coloris (Dialogue on Colour), and his 1677 Conversations sur la Peinture (Conversations on Painting). The argument was similar to the argument over the merits of disegno and colore in Italy in the fifteenth century but with a particularly French character as the importance of drawing was one of the key tenets of the French Academy and any attack on it was effectively an attack on everything the Academy stood for, including its political functions in support of the King. To a certain extent, the debate was simply about whether it was acceptable to paint purely in order to give pleasure to the viewer without the nobler purposes typical of a \\"history\\" painting.Levey, Michael. (1993) Painting and sculpture in France 1700-1789. New Haven: Yale University Press, p. 1. ==Resolution== Watteau's The Embarkation for Cythera, 1717. A success for the Rubenists was achieved when Roger de Piles was elected a member (as an amateur) of the French Academy in 1699, and the final signal that the Rubenists had won came when Antoine Watteau's The Embarkation for Cythera was accepted as his reception piece by the Academy in 1717. Watteau's acceptance was, however, perhaps not everything that he could have hoped for. When he applied to join the Academy, there was no suitable category for his f√™te galante works, so the academy simply created one rather than reject his application, describing him as a \\"peintre des festes galantes\\".Kleiner, Fred, S. (Ed.) (2011) Gardner's Art Through the Ages: A global history. Enhanced 13th edn. Boston: Wadsworth, p. 755. Clarke, M. & D. (2010) \\"f√™te galante\\" in The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms. oxfordreference.com, Oxford University Press. Retrieved 8 November 2013. While this acknowledged Watteau as the originator of that genre, and was a significant mark of acceptance both of him and his style of painting, it also prevented him being recognised as a history painter, the highest class of painter, and the only one from which the academy's professors were drawn. Charles-Antoine Coypel, the son of its then director, tellingly said: \\"The charming paintings of this gracious painter would be a bad guide for whoever wished to paint the Acts of the Apostles.\\"Humphrey Wine and Annie Scottez-De Wambrechies. \\"Watteau\\" in Grove Art Online. oxfordartonline.com Oxford University Press. Retrieved 8 February 2014. Watteau is considered the greatest of the Rubenist artists. Other important Rubenists include Fran√ßois Boucher and Jean-Honor√© Fragonard. Jean- Baptiste-Sim√©on Chardin benefited from the new found interest in still-life and genre painting.Janson, 1995, p. 607. ==Significance== The debate and the overlapping development of the Rococo in eighteenth century France have been seen as a form of revival. Michael Levey has pointed out that it was during the seventeenth century that the new categories of genre, landscape and still life had become established with their emphasis on the observation of nature, and therefore the arguments of the Rubenists amounted to a revival of existing traditions of naturalism and a call for a greater discipline in painting rather than representing an attitude of general licence or laissez-faire as is sometimes assumed. The argument also took place during the beginning of the Enlightenment and the Rubenists found support in John Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690), which argued that all ideas derived from experience and that none were innate. Jean-Baptiste Dubos observed that what was comprehended through the mind paled compared to what was apprehended through the senses. ==See also== *Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns ==References * Poussinistes vs. Rubenistes Category:French art movements Category:Controversies in France Category:Culture-related controversies Category:History of ideas Category:Peter Paul Rubens ","title":"Poussinists and Rubenists"},{"id":"2230361","text":"Lambda lifting is a meta-process that restructures a computer program so that functions are defined independently of each other in a global scope. An individual \\"lift\\" transforms a local function into a global function. It is a two step process, consisting of; * Eliminating free variables in the function by adding parameters. * Moving functions from a restricted scope to broader or global scope. The term \\"lambda lifting\\" was first introduced by Thomas Johnsson around 1982 and was historically considered as a mechanism for implementing functional programming languages. It is used in conjunction with other techniques in some modern compilers. Lambda lifting is not the same as closure conversion. It requires all call sites to be adjusted (adding extra arguments to calls) and does not introduce a closure for the lifted lambda expression. In contrast, closure conversion does not require call sites to be adjusted but does introduce a closure for the lambda expression mapping free variables to values. The technique may be used on individual functions, in code refactoring, to make a function usable outside the scope in which it was written. Lambda lifts may also be repeated, in order to transform the program. Repeated lifts may be used to convert a program written in lambda calculus into a set of recursive functions, without lambdas. This demonstrates the equivalence of programs written in lambda calculus and programs written as functions. However it does not demonstrate the soundness of lambda calculus for deduction, as the eta reduction used in lambda lifting is the step that introduces cardinality problems into the lambda calculus, because it removes the value from the variable, without first checking that there is only one value that satisfies the conditions on the variable (see Curry's paradox). Lambda lifting is expensive on processing time for the compiler. An efficient implementation of lambda lifting is O(n^2) on processing time for the compiler. In the untyped lambda calculus, where the basic types are functions, lifting may change the result of beta reduction of a lambda expression. The resulting functions will have the same meaning, in a mathematical sense, but are not regarded as the same function in the untyped lambda calculus. See also intensional versus extensional equality. The reverse operation to lambda lifting is lambda dropping. Lambda dropping may make the compilation of programs quicker for the compiler, and may also increase the efficiency of the resulting program, by reducing the number of parameters, and reducing the size of stack frames. However it makes a function harder to re-use. A dropped function is tied to its context, and can only be used in a different context if it is first lifted. ==Algorithm== The following algorithm is one way to lambda-lift an arbitrary program in a language which doesn't support closures as first-class objects: # Rename the functions so that each function has a unique name. # Replace each free variable with an additional argument to the enclosing function, and pass that argument to every use of the function. # Replace every local function definition that has no free variables with an identical global function. # Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all free variables and local functions are eliminated. If the language has closures as first-class objects that can be passed as arguments or returned from other functions, the closure will need to be represented by a data structure that captures the bindings of the free variables. ==Example== The following OCaml program computes the sum of the integers from 1 to 100: let rec sum n = if n = 1 then 1 else let f x = n + x in f (sum (n - 1)) in sum 100 (The \`let rec\` declares \`sum\` as a function that may call itself.) The function f, which adds sum's argument to the sum of the numbers less than the argument, is a local function. Within the definition of f, n is a free variable. Start by converting the free variable to a parameter: let rec sum n = if n = 1 then 1 else let f w x = w + x in f n (sum (n - 1)) in sum 100 Next, lift f into a global function: let rec f w x = w + x and sum n = if n = 1 then 1 else f n (sum (n - 1)) in sum 100 The following is the same example, this time written in JavaScript: // Initial version function sum(n) { function f(x) { return n + x; } if (n == 1) return 1; else return f(sum(n - 1)); } // After converting the free variable n to a formal parameter w function sum(n) { function f(w, x) { return w + x; } if (n == 1) return 1; else return f(n, sum(n - 1)); } // After lifting function f into the global scope function f(w, x) { return w + x; } function sum(n) { if (n == 1) return 1; else return f(n, sum(n - 1)); } == Lambda lifting versus closures == Lambda lifting and closure are both methods for implementing block structured programs. It implements block structure by eliminating it. All functions are lifted to the global level. Closure conversion provides a \\"closure\\" which links the current frame to other frames. Closure conversion takes less compile time. Recursive functions, and block structured programs, with or without lifting, may be implemented using a stack based implementation, which is simple and efficient. However a stack frame based implementation must be strict (eager). The stack frame based implementation requires that the life of functions be last-in, first-out (LIFO). That is, the most recent function to start its calculation must be the first to end. Some functional languages (such as Haskell) are implemented using lazy evaluation, which delays calculation until the value is needed. The lazy implementation strategy gives flexibility to the programmer. Lazy evaluation requires delaying the call to a function until a request is made to the value calculated by the function. One implementation is to record a reference to a \\"frame\\" of data describing the calculation, in place of the value. Later when the value is required, the frame is used to calculate the value, just in time for when it is needed. The calculated value then replaces the reference. The \\"frame\\" is similar to a stack frame, the difference being that it is not stored on the stack. Lazy evaluation requires that all the data required for the calculation be saved in the frame. If the function is \\"lifted\\", then the frame needs only record the function pointer, and the parameters to the function. Some modern languages use garbage collection in place of stack based allocation to manage the life of variables. In a managed, garbage collected environment, a closure records references to the frames from which values may be obtained. In contrast a lifted function has parameters for each value needed in the calculation. == Let expressions and lambda calculus == The Let expression is useful in describing lifting and dropping, and in describing the relationship between recursive equations and lambda expressions. Most functional languages have let expressions. Also, block structured programming languages like ALGOL and Pascal are similar in that they too allow the local definition of a function for use in a restricted scope. The let expression used here is a fully mutually recursive version of let rec, as implemented in many functional languages. Let expressions are related to Lambda calculus. Lambda calculus has a simple syntax and semantics, and is good for describing Lambda lifting. It is convenient to describe lambda lifting as a translations from lambda to a let expression, and lambda dropping as the reverse. This is because let expressions allow mutual recursion, which is, in a sense, more lifted than is supported in lambda calculus. Lambda calculus does not support mutual recursion and only one function may be defined at the outermost global scope. Conversion rules which describe translation without lifting are given in the Let expression article. The following rules describe the equivalence of lambda and let expressions, : \\\\begin{array}{ll} \\\\textbf{Name} & \\\\textbf{Law} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\text{Eta-reduction equivalence} & f\\\\ x = y \\\\equiv f = \\\\lambda x.y \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{Let-Lambda equivalence} & f ot \\\\in FV(E) \\\\to (\\\\operatorname{let} f : f = E \\\\operatorname{in} L \\\\equiv (\\\\lambda f.L)\\\\ E) \\\\ \\\\text{(where }f\\\\text{ is a variable name.)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{Let combination} & x ot \\\\in FV(E) \\\\to (\\\\operatorname{let} v, ..., w, x : E \\\\land F \\\\operatorname{in} L \\\\equiv \\\\operatorname{let} v, ..., w: E \\\\operatorname{in} \\\\operatorname{let} x : F \\\\operatorname{in} L) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} Meta-functions will be given that describe lambda lifting and dropping. A meta-function is a function that takes a program as a parameter. The program is data for the meta-program. The program and the meta program are at different meta-levels. The following conventions will be used to distinguish program from the meta program, * Square brackets [] will be used to represent function application in the meta program. * Capital letters will be used for variables in the meta program. Lower case letters represent variables in the program. * \\\\equiv will be used for equals in the meta program. * \\\\\\\\_ represents a dummy variable, or an unknown value. For simplicity the first rule given that matches will be applied. The rules also assume that the lambda expressions have been pre- processed so that each lambda abstraction has a unique name. The substitution operator is used extensively. The expression L[G := S] means substitute every occurrence of G in L by S and return the expression. The definition used is extended to cover the substitution of expressions, from the definition given on the Lambda calculus page. The matching of expressions should compare expressions for alpha equivalence (renaming of variables). == Lambda lifting in lambda calculus == Each lambda lift takes a lambda abstraction which is a sub expression of a lambda expression and replaces it by a function call (application) to a function that it creates. The free variables in the sub expression are the parameters to the function call. Lambda lifts may be used on individual functions, in code refactoring, to make a function usable outside the scope in which it was written. Such lifts may also be repeated, until the expression has no lambda abstractions, in order to transform the program. === Lambda lift === A lift is given a sub-expression within an expression to lift to the top of that expression. The expression may be part of a larger program. This allows control of where the sub-expression is lifted to. The lambda lift operation used to perform a lift within a program is, : \\\\operatorname{lambda-lift-op}[S, L, P] =P[L := \\\\operatorname{lambda-lift}[S, L The sub expression may be either a lambda abstraction, or a lambda abstraction applied to a parameter. Two types of lift are possible. * Anonymous lift * Named lift An anonymous lift has a lift expression which is a lambda abstraction only. It is regarded as defining an anonymous function. A name must be created for the function. A named lift expression has a lambda abstraction applied to an expression. This lift is regarded as a named definition of a function.  Anonymous lift  An anonymous lift takes a lambda abstraction (called S). For S; * Create a name for the function that will replace S (called V). Make sure that the name identified by V has not been used. * Add parameters to V, for all the free variables in S, to create an expression G (see make-call). The lambda lift is the substitution of the lambda abstraction S for a function application, along with the addition of a definition for the function. : \\\\operatorname{lambda-lift}[S, L] \\\\equiv \\\\operatorname{let} V: \\\\operatorname{de-lambda}[G = S] \\\\operatorname{in} L[S:=G] The new lambda expression has S substituted for G. Note that L[S:=G] means substitution of S for G in L. The function definitions has the function definition G = S added. In the above rule G is the function application that is substituted for the expression S. It is defined by, : G = \\\\operatorname{make-call}[V, \\\\operatorname{FV}[S where V is the function name. It must be a new variable, i.e. a name not already used in the lambda expression, : V ot \\\\in \\\\operatorname{vars}[\\\\operatorname{let} F \\\\operatorname{in} L] where \\\\operatorname{vars}[E] is a meta function that returns the set of variables used in E. { class=\\" mw-collapsible mw- collapsed\\" - !

The result is, gives, : \\\\operatorname{lambda-lift}[(\\\\lambda x.f\\\\ (x\\\\ x))\\\\ (\\\\lambda x.f\\\\ (x\\\\ x)), \\\\lambda f.(\\\\lambda x.f\\\\ (x\\\\ x))\\\\ (\\\\lambda x.f\\\\ (x\\\\ x))] \\\\equiv \\\\operatorname{let} x\\\\ f\\\\ y = f \\\\ (y\\\\ y) \\\\operatorname{in} \\\\lambda f.(x\\\\ f)\\\\ (x\\\\ f) } === Lambda-lift transformation === A lambda lift transformation takes a lambda expression and lifts all lambda abstractions to the top of the expression. The abstractions are then translated into recursive functions, which eliminates the lambda abstractions. The result is a functional program in the form, * \\\\operatorname{let} M \\\\operatorname{in} N where M is a series of function definitions, and N is the expression representing the value returned. For example, : \\\\operatorname{lambda-lift-tran}[\\\\lambda f.(\\\\lambda x.f\\\\ (x\\\\ x))\\\\ (\\\\lambda x.f\\\\ (x\\\\ x))] \\\\equiv \\\\operatorname{let} p\\\\ f\\\\ x = f\\\\ (x\\\\ x) \\\\land q\\\\ p\\\\ f = (p\\\\ f)\\\\ (p\\\\ f) \\\\operatorname{in} q\\\\ p The de-let meta function may then be used to convert the result back into lambda calculus. : \\\\operatorname{de-let}[\\\\operatorname{lambda-lift-tran}[\\\\lambda f.(\\\\lambda x.f\\\\ (x\\\\ x))\\\\ (\\\\lambda x.f\\\\ (x\\\\ x)) \\\\equiv (\\\\lambda p.(\\\\lambda q.q\\\\ p)\\\\ \\\\lambda p.\\\\lambda f.(p\\\\ f)\\\\ (p\\\\ f))\\\\ \\\\lambda f.\\\\lambda x.f\\\\ (x\\\\ x) The processing of transforming the lambda expression is a series of lifts. Each lift has, * A sub expression chosen for it by the function lift-choice. The sub expression should be chosen so that it may be converted into an equation with no lambdas. * The lift is performed by a call to the lambda-lift meta function, described in the next section, :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\operatorname{lambda-lift-tran}[L] = \\\\operatorname{drop-params-tran}[\\\\operatorname{merge-let}[\\\\operatorname{lambda- apply}[L ]\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{lambda-apply}[L] = \\\\operatorname{lambda- process}[\\\\operatorname{lift-choice}[L],L]\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{lambda- process}[\\\\operatorname{none}, L] = L\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{lambda-process}[S, L] = \\\\operatorname{lambda-apply}[\\\\operatorname{lambda-lift}[S, L \\\\end{cases} After the lifts are applied the lets are combined together into a single let. :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\operatorname{merge-let}[\\\\operatorname{let} V : E \\\\operatorname{in} \\\\operatorname{let} W : F \\\\operatorname{in} G] = \\\\operatorname{merge-let}[\\\\operatorname{let} V, W : E \\\\land F \\\\operatorname{in} G] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{merge-let}[E] = E \\\\end{cases} Then Parameter dropping is applied to remove parameters that are not necessary in the \\"let\\" expression. The let expression allows the function definitions to refer to each other directly, whereas lambda abstractions are strictly hierarchical, and a function may not directly refer to itself.  Choosing the expression for lifting  There are two different ways that an expression may be selected for lifting. The first treats all lambda abstractions as defining anonymous functions. The second, treats lambda abstractions which are applied to a parameter as defining a function. Lambda abstractions applied to a parameter have a dual interpretation as either a let expression defining a function, or as defining an anonymous function. Both interpretations are valid. These two predicates are needed for both definitions. lambda-free - An expression containing no lambda abstractions. :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\operatorname{lambda- free}[\\\\lambda F.X] = \\\\operatorname{false} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{lambda-free}[V] = \\\\operatorname{true} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{lambda-free}[M\\\\ N] = \\\\operatorname{lambda-free}[M] \\\\land \\\\operatorname{lambda-free}[N] \\\\end{cases} lambda-anon - An anonymous function. An expression like \\\\lambda x_1.\\\\ ...\\\\ \\\\lambda x_n.X where X is lambda free. :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\operatorname{lambda- anon}[\\\\lambda F.X] = \\\\operatorname{lambda-free}[X] \\\\lor \\\\operatorname{lambda- anon}[X] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{lambda-anon}[V] = \\\\operatorname{false} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{lambda-anon}[M\\\\ N] = \\\\operatorname{false} \\\\end{cases} = Choosing anonymous functions only for lifting = Search for the deepest anonymous abstraction, so that when the lift is applied the function lifted will become a simple equation. This definition does not recognize a lambda abstractions with a parameter as defining a function. All lambda abstractions are regarded as defining anonymous functions. lift-choice - The first anonymous found in traversing the expression or none if there is no function. # \\\\operatorname{lambda-anon}[X] \\\\to \\\\operatorname{lift-choice}[X] = X # \\\\operatorname{lift-choice}[\\\\lambda F.X] = \\\\operatorname{lift-choice}[X] # \\\\operatorname{lift-choice}[M] e \\\\operatorname{none} \\\\to \\\\operatorname{lift- choice}[M\\\\ N] = \\\\operatorname{lift-choice}[M] # \\\\operatorname{lift- choice}[M\\\\ N] = \\\\operatorname{lift-choice}[N] # \\\\operatorname{lift- choice}[V] = \\\\operatorname{none} For example, { class=\\" mw- collapsible mw-collapsed\\" style=\\"white-space: nowrap;\\" + Lambda choice on \\\\lambda f.(\\\\lambda x.f\\\\ (x\\\\ x))\\\\ (\\\\lambda y.f\\\\ (y\\\\ y)) is \\\\lambda x.f\\\\ (x\\\\ x) - !

This definition recognizes a lambda abstraction with an actual parameter as defining a function. Only lambda abstractions without an application are treated as anonymous functions. ; lambda-named : A named function. An expression like (\\\\lambda F.M)\\\\ N where M is lambda free and N is lambda free or an anonymous function. :: \\\\begin{array}{l} \\\\operatorname{lambda-named}[(\\\\lambda F.M)\\\\ N] = \\\\operatorname{lambda-free}[M] \\\\land \\\\operatorname{lambda-anon}[N] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{lambda-named}[\\\\lambda F.X] = \\\\operatorname{false} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{lambda-named}[V] = \\\\operatorname{false} \\\\end{array} ; lift-choice : The first anonymous or named function found in traversing the expression or none if there is no function. :# \\\\operatorname{lambda-named}[X] \\\\lor \\\\operatorname{lambda-anon}[X] \\\\to \\\\operatorname{lift-choice}[X] = X :# \\\\operatorname{lift-choice}[\\\\lambda F.X] = \\\\operatorname{lift-choice}[X] :# \\\\operatorname{lift-choice}[M] e \\\\operatorname{none} \\\\to \\\\operatorname{lift-choice}[M\\\\ N] = \\\\operatorname{lift- choice}[M] :# \\\\operatorname{lift-choice}[M\\\\ N] = \\\\operatorname{lift- choice}[N] :# \\\\operatorname{lift-choice}[V] = \\\\operatorname{none} For example, { class=\\" mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\\" style=\\"white-space: nowrap;\\" + Lambda choice on \\\\lambda f.(\\\\lambda x.f\\\\ (x\\\\ x))\\\\ (\\\\lambda y.f\\\\ (y\\\\ y)) is (\\\\lambda x.f\\\\ (x\\\\ x))\\\\ (\\\\lambda y.f\\\\ (y\\\\ y)) - !

The value is defined if the function has a fixed point. But the function will never terminate. == Lambda dropping in lambda calculus == Lambda dropping is making the scope of functions smaller and using the context from the reduced scope to reduce the number of parameters to functions. Reducing the number of parameters makes functions easier to comprehend. In the Lambda lifting section, a meta function for first lifting and then converting the resulting lambda expression into recursive equation was described. The Lambda Drop meta function performs the reverse by first converting recursive equations to lambda abstractions, and then dropping the resulting lambda expression, into the smallest scope which covers all references to the lambda abstraction. Lambda dropping is performed in two steps, * Sinking * Parameter dropping === Lambda drop === A Lambda drop is applied to an expression which is part of a program. Dropping is controlled by a set of expressions from which the drop will be excluded. : \\\\operatorname{lambda-drop-op}[L, P, X] = P[L := \\\\operatorname{drop-params-tran}[\\\\operatorname{sink-test}[L, X ] where, : L is the lambda abstraction to be dropped. : P is the program : X is a set of expressions to be excluded from dropping. === Lambda drop transformation === The lambda drop transformation sinks all abstractions in an expression. Sinking is excluded from expressions in a set of expressions, : \\\\operatorname{lambda-drop-tran}[L, X] = \\\\operatorname{drop-params- tran}[\\\\operatorname{sink-tran}[\\\\operatorname{de-let}[L, X ] where, : L is the expression to be transformed. : X is a set of sub expressions to be excluded from the dropping. sink-tran sinks each abstraction, starting from the innermost, :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\operatorname{sink-tran}[(\\\\lambda N.B)\\\\ Y, X] = \\\\operatorname{sink-test}[(\\\\lambda N.\\\\operatorname{sink-tran}[B])\\\\ \\\\operatorname{sink-tran}[Y], X] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{sink-tran}[\\\\lambda N.B, X] = \\\\lambda N.\\\\operatorname{sink-tran}[B, X] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{sink-tran}[M\\\\ N, X] = \\\\operatorname{sink-tran}[M, X]\\\\ \\\\operatorname{sink-tran}[M, X] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{sink-tran}[V, X] = V \\\\end{cases} === Abstraction sinking === Sinking is moving a lambda abstraction inwards as far as possible such that it is still outside all references to the variable. Application - 4 cases. :\\\\begin{cases} E ot \\\\in \\\\operatorname{FV}[G] \\\\land E ot \\\\in \\\\operatorname{FV}[H] \\\\to \\\\operatorname{sink}[(\\\\lambda E.G\\\\ H)\\\\ Y, X] = G\\\\ H \\\\\\\\\\\\ E ot \\\\in \\\\operatorname{FV}[G] \\\\land E \\\\in \\\\operatorname{FV}[H] \\\\to \\\\operatorname{sink}[(\\\\lambda E.G\\\\ H)\\\\ Y, X] = \\\\operatorname{sink-test}[G\\\\ \\\\operatorname{sink-test}[(\\\\lambda E.H)\\\\ Y, X \\\\\\\\\\\\ E \\\\in \\\\operatorname{FV}[G] \\\\land E ot \\\\in \\\\operatorname{FV}[H] \\\\to \\\\operatorname{sink}[(\\\\lambda E.G\\\\ H)\\\\ Y, X] = (\\\\operatorname{sink-test}[(\\\\lambda E.G)\\\\ Y, X])\\\\ H \\\\\\\\\\\\ E \\\\in \\\\operatorname{FV}[G] \\\\land E \\\\in \\\\operatorname{FV}[H] \\\\to \\\\operatorname{sink}[(\\\\lambda E.G\\\\ H)\\\\ Y, X] = (\\\\lambda E.G\\\\ H)\\\\ Y \\\\end{cases} Abstraction.

Lambda lifting added parameters that were necessary so that a function can be moved out of its context. In dropping, this process is reversed, and extra parameters that contain variables that are free may be removed. Dropping a parameter is removing an unnecessary parameter from a function, where the actual parameter being passed in is always the same expression. The free variables of the expression must also be free where the function is defined. In this case the parameter that is dropped is replaced by the expression in the body of the function definition. This makes the parameter unnecessary. For example, consider, : \\\\lambda m,p,q.(\\\\lambda g.\\\\lambda n.(n\\\\ (g\\\\ m\\\\ p\\\\ n)\\\\ (g\\\\ q\\\\ p\\\\ n)))\\\\ \\\\lambda x.\\\\lambda o.\\\\lambda y.o\\\\ x\\\\ y In this example the actual parameter for the formal parameter o is always p. As p is a free variable in the whole expression, the parameter may be dropped. The actual parameter for the formal parameter y is always n. However n is bound in a lambda abstraction. So this parameter may not be dropped. The result of dropping the parameter is, : \\\\operatorname{drop-params-tran}[\\\\lambda m,p,q.(\\\\lambda g.\\\\lambda n.n\\\\ (g\\\\ m\\\\ p\\\\ n)\\\\ (g\\\\ q\\\\ p\\\\ n))\\\\ \\\\lambda x.\\\\lambda o.\\\\lambda y.o\\\\ x\\\\ y :::::: \\\\equiv \\\\lambda m,p,q.(\\\\lambda g.\\\\lambda n.n\\\\ (g\\\\ m\\\\ n)\\\\ (g\\\\ q\\\\ n))\\\\ \\\\lambda x.\\\\lambda y.p\\\\ x\\\\ y For the main example, : \\\\operatorname{drop- params-tran}[ \\\\lambda f.(\\\\lambda p.(p\\\\ f)\\\\ (p\\\\ f))\\\\ (\\\\lambda f.\\\\lambda x.f\\\\ (x\\\\ x))] :::::: \\\\equiv \\\\lambda f.(\\\\lambda p.p\\\\ p)\\\\ (\\\\lambda x.f\\\\ (x\\\\ x)) The definition of drop-params-tran is, :\\\\operatorname{drop-params-tran}[L] \\\\equiv (\\\\operatorname{drop-params}[L, D, FV[L], [ ) where, : \\\\operatorname{build- param-list}[L, D, V, \\\\\\\\_]  Build parameter lists  For each abstraction that defines a function, build the information required to make decisions on dropping names. This information describes each parameter; the parameter name, the expression for the actual value, and an indication that all the expressions have the same value. For example, in, : \\\\lambda m,p,q.(\\\\lambda g.\\\\lambda n.(n\\\\ (g\\\\ m\\\\ p\\\\ n)\\\\ (g\\\\ q\\\\ p\\\\ n)))\\\\ \\\\lambda x.\\\\lambda o.\\\\lambda y.o\\\\ x\\\\ y the parameters to the function g are, {  - ! Formal Parameter !! All Same Value !! Actual parameter expression -  x  false  _ -  o  true  p -  y  true  n } Each abstraction is renamed with a unique name, and the parameter list is associated with the name of the abstraction. For example, g there is parameter list. : D[g] = x, \\\\operatorname{false}, \\\\\\\\_], [o, \\\\\\\\_, p], [y, \\\\\\\\_, n build- param-lists builds all the lists for an expression, by traversing the expression. It has four parameters; * The lambda expression being analyzed. * The table parameter lists for names. * The table of values for parameters. * The returned parameter list, which is used internally by the Abstraction - A lambda expression of the form (\\\\lambda N.S)\\\\ L is analyzed to extract the names of parameters for the function. :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\operatorname{build- param-lists}[(\\\\lambda N.S)\\\\ L, D, V, R] \\\\equiv \\\\operatorname{build-param- lists}[S, D, V, R] \\\\land \\\\operatorname{build-list}[L, D, V, D[N \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{build-param-lists}[\\\\lambda N.S, D, V, R] \\\\equiv \\\\operatorname{build-param-lists}[S, D, V, R] \\\\end{cases} Locate the name and start building the parameter list for the name, filling in the formal parameter names.

Retrieve a parameter record from the parameter list from the expression, and check that the current parameter value matches this parameter.

The same value indicator is never set to true. It is only set to false if all the values cannot be matched. The value is retrieved by using S to build a set of the Boolean values allowed for S. If true is a member then all the values for this parameter are equal, and the parameter may be dropped. : \\\\operatorname{ask}[S] \\\\equiv S \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ X : X = S \\\\\\\\} Similarly, def uses set theory to query if a variable has been given a value; : \\\\operatorname{def}[F] \\\\equiv \\\\\\\\{X : X = F\\\\\\\\} Let - Let expression. : \\\\operatorname{build-param- list}[\\\\operatorname{let} V: E \\\\operatorname{in} L, D, V, \\\\\\\\_] \\\\equiv \\\\operatorname{build-param-list}[E, D, V, \\\\\\\\_] \\\\land \\\\operatorname{build-param- list}[L, D, V, \\\\\\\\_] And - For use in \\"let\\". : \\\\operatorname{build-param- lists}[E \\\\land F, D, V, \\\\\\\\_] \\\\equiv \\\\operatorname{build-param-lists}[E, D, V, \\\\\\\\_] \\\\land \\\\operatorname{build-param-lists}[F, D, V, \\\\\\\\_] = Examples = For example, building the parameter lists for, : \\\\lambda m,p,q.(\\\\lambda g.\\\\lambda n.(n\\\\ (g\\\\ m\\\\ p\\\\ n)\\\\ (g\\\\ q\\\\ p\\\\ n)))\\\\ \\\\lambda x.\\\\lambda o.\\\\lambda y.o\\\\ x\\\\ y gives, : D[g] = x, \\\\operatorname{false}, \\\\\\\\_], [o, \\\\operatorname{true}, p], [y, \\\\operatorname{true}, n and the parameter o is dropped to give, : \\\\lambda m,p,q.(\\\\lambda g.\\\\lambda n.(n\\\\ (g\\\\ m\\\\ n)\\\\ (g\\\\ q\\\\ n)))\\\\ \\\\lambda x.\\\\lambda y.p\\\\ x\\\\ y { class=\\" mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\\" - !

Massacration was created in the sketch comedy show Hermes & Renato along with other fake bands such as the indietronica \\"Tamb√©m Sou Hype\\" (\\"I'm Also Hype\\", a parody of CSS), samba school \\"Unidos do Caralho a Quatro\\" or the ax√© band \\"Cora√ß√£o Mel√£o\\" (Melon Heart). But, like The Monkees, Massacration became a huge success, and a real band. ==HistoryFictional origin=== According to a mockumentary shown in MTV (parodying their own Rockumentary format) in December 2004, the band began in 1979, when a young delinquent called John Hammet (Blondie Hammet) was directed to the juvenile hall for the sixth time. There, Hammet played guitar as his only hobby, thus bringing the attention of David Sutter (Bruno Sutter Detonator), committed for trafficking quails. They had become very close friends. After being released from detention, they approached Donald Polai and formed a band called Death Mania (which seemed to be more like a jam band, seeing as there was no bassist or drummer - Polai played tambourine). Unfortunately, the band lasted nothing but a couple of minutes after their first gig when Polai, influenced by the name, committed suicide. Hammet and Sutter, depressed over the loss, became addicted to pasta from a ristorante named \\"Massas Crezio\\" (Crezio's Pasta, named after Crezio, the young owner of the establishment), and ate so much of his food they wound up going 100 pounds overweight. Crezio intervened, conceding them a space in his property so that Hammet and Sutter could rehearse, which made them overcome their depression and lose all the weight they had gained. In order to reform the band, they decided to put an ad in a local newspaper looking for a drummer, a rhythm guitarist and a bassist. The three candidates who filled these spots were, respectively, Jimmy \\"The Hammer\\" Lombardo, Klaus Bisonnette (Headmaster) and Rick Banday (Metal Avenger). Coincidentally enough, all three of them worked with Crezio. The band was formed again. In order to pay homage to Crezio and his pivotal role on getting the band back together (also because his business sponsored the band), the band was rebaptized as MASSASCREZIO. The cacophonic name later on suffered a series of mutations: MASSACREZIO, MASSACRETION, and finally MASSACRATION . Right after their first gig as Massacration, they had already hooked up with Dick Dornelle, a famed record producer who had worked with the likes of Queen, Iron Maiden and Michael Jackson. With Dornelle, the band had signed with a label called Shusi Records and, even without any recorded material, their popularity had skyrocketed in but a matter of hours. Only then would they go on to record their first single, \\"Metal Massacre Attack\\", whose recording sessions lasted two whole months in a studio in North Carolina. \\"Metal Massacre Attack\\" consolidated their success by debuting at number one on Billboard Hot 100, anachronistically in front of contemporary names like Usher, Maroon 5 and Gavin DeGraw, and earning the band a \\"Gremlin\\". One day however, Detonator, reduced to a pauper, knocked the door to Hammet's house. They instantly recognized themselves and the reunion brought about a maelstrom of emotions. Clean from his addiction, Detonator was readmitted into the band, making the three remaining members change their minds about taking their old jobs back. As their comeback act, the band promptly released their second single, \\"Metal Bucetation\\", which rose them to the top again due to its lightning-quick selling - there were even riots because there were relatively too few singles for too many people. Trailing this success came \\"Metal Milk Shake\\", their third single, that sold 12 billion copies, certifying them with a sixfold diamond record (actually, by RIAA standards, such a mark is equivalent to 1,200 diamond records), as well as helping Massacration be heralded with the Nobel Prize in Music, which had only been awarded to Mozart, Beethoven and Frank Sinatra. ===Biography=== Detonator, the band's lead singer. The band was idealized by and composed of members of the Brazilian comedy act Hermes & Renato (currently known as \\"Banana Mec√¢nica\\" - Clockwork Banana) that aired on MTV in 2002, in a trash horror movie-like segment that showed a youngster who bought a Massacration record and, by playing it backwards, triggered a curse that, ultimately, turned back against him. After this segment, an \\"exclusive interview\\" with the five band members and then, the video premiere for \\"Metal Massacre Attack\\", were aired. In these segments, the name of the band did not have the present spelling: it read \\"Masacretion\\" on the record cover, and \\"Massacrassion\\" in the interview sketch. After the making of the song (and video) \\"Metal Massacre Attack\\", the video began airing not only on the Hermes e Renato comedy show, but also on the MTV regular rotation videos. The promo video was such a success that the crew was forced to make more songs and videos. \\"Metal Bucetation\\" followed \\"Metal Massacre Attack\\". In 2005 they finally finished their first album, Gates of Metal Fried Chicken of Death, produced by Jo√£o Gordo, lead singer of Ratos de Por√£o, a reputed hardcore punk Brazilian band. The first single was \\"Metal is the Law\\". Because Jimmy \\"The Hammer\\" and Headmaster are not real musicians, Igor Cavalera recorded the drums and Blondie Hammet recorded all the guitars. They have been requested to perform live their songs, and have so far appeared in the Abril Pro Rock Festival and Brasil Metal Union (the latter an all-heavy metal festival). Most of the humour effect of the band relies on its use of a fake English (mocking the fact that many Brazilians prefer foreign music despite being unable to understand it), exaggerate posing, outrageous clothes and gear. The success they achieved was so high, they even have their own MTV show, where only heavy metal videos are broadcast (which, to some, is surprising, considering the pop-oriented nature of MTV). It is rumored that their tour drummer is Cavalera Conspiracy's Igor Cavalera. Massacration actually opened some venues for Sepultura during the course of 2005, and Cavalera actually played with them in some venues, under the alias \\"El Covero\\" (Spanish for the gravedigger). Massacration debuted in 2006 in Rockgol, a Brazilian MTV show, in the Pirul√¢ndia team, along with Supla, Falamansa, Sonic Jr. and Lucas Santtana. In 2009, the follow-up album, Good Blood Headbanguers, was released (\\"Good Blood\\" being a literal translation of the Brazilian expression sangue bom, meaning a nice, trustworthy person). By this time, the band's aesthetics has leaned more towards glam metal (notably in the power ballad \\"The Bull\\", about a man who was cheated on by his girlfriend) while generally retaining its traditional metal sound. As another highlight, the album was produced by Roy Z, well known for his work as guitarist in Rob Halford's solo project and as producer with many other bands and artists such as Bruce Dickinson. On July 30, 2014, Fausto Fanti (Blondie Hammett) was found dead in his apartment. He hanged himself with a belt. On May 20, 2016 Massacration reunited and released a new song called \\"Grand Pedido\\" to promote the return of McDonald's Grand Big Mac hamburger, which uses elements of rock and heavy metal as main concept. On December 20, 2016, Massacration's comeback was officialized, with the release of a new single, \\"Metal Milf\\". ===Style=== Massacration during a presentation in Fortaleza, 2017. Massacration chiefly satirises Manowar, Angra, Judas Priest and Iron Maiden, with minor references to Sepultura, Saxon, Black Sabbath and Viking metal in general. Their main targets are the Brazilian heavy/power metal fans who can't speak English but nevertheless love the genre, the Brazilian groups who sing in English (like Angra, Dr. Sin, Sepultura, Viper and others) and the heavy metal culture in general, with its leather jackets, black clothes, long hair and frowns. The very fact that the Brazilian headbangers laughed at their jokes and even embraced their music. Regarding their lyrics, they are intentionally written in a very broken English (which may be unintelligible in a native speaker's ears) mixed with embromation (macaronic words formed by the addition of typical English suffixes like -ation, -atic, -ful, -ness and others to Portuguese roots). Sometimes entire sentences or stanzas can be in Brazilian Portuguese‚Äîand not gibberish, unlike some foreigners believe. For instance, the introduction of \\"Metal is the Law\\" includes the lines: ai, ai, ai, ai,/ em cima, embaixo/e puxa e vai, which are verses taken from a 'marchinha de Carnaval' (Carnival song) known nationwide and would translate to ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh/above, below/pull and go. Also, some words whose translation would not be known are thrown in the lyrics in Portuguese, like the first verse of \\"Metal Dental Destruction\\", which says \\"fear of the killing broca...\\", in which broca refers to a dental drill. The overall image of the band, their subjects and the recurrent terminology suggest a heavy influence of Manowar (and Judas Priest as well, especially when it comes to their image of leather- clad headbangers). However, while most of their songs have names that suggest violence, death, sorrow and sacrilege, they are actually always light-hearted, humorous and na√Øve, pointing to a joyride lifestyle instead of the gloomy atmosphere of actual heavy metal records. ==Discography== *Gates of Metal Fried Chicken of Death (2005) *Good Blood Headbanguers (2009) ==Band membersCurrent members=== *Detonator (Bruno Sutter) - lead vocals (2004-2012, 2016‚Äìpresent) *Metal Avenger (Marco Ant√¥nio Alves) - bass guitar, backing vocals (2004-2012), lead guitar (2016-present) *Headmaster (Adriano Pereira) - rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2004-2012, 2016‚Äìpresent, studio only) *Jimmy \\"The Hammer\\" (Felipe Torres) - drums, percussion (2004-2012, 2016‚Äìpresent, studio only) *Red Head Hammett (Franco Fanti) - bass guitar, backing vocals (2016‚Äìpresent, studio only) ===Former members=== *Blondie Hammett (Fausto Fanti) - lead guitar, backing vocals (2004-2012, died 2014) ===Session musicians=== *Straupelator (Nando Lima) - drums (2004-2012, live) *El Perro Loco (Ricardo Confessori) - drums (2016‚Äìpresent, live) *El Muro (Marco Klein) - bass (2016‚Äìpresent, live) ==References * *Detonator Official Site Category:Brazilian heavy metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 2002 Category:Comedy musical groups Category:Musical quintets Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2012 Category:2004 establishments in Brazil Category:2012 disestablishments in Brazil Category:EMI Records artists ","title":"Massacration"},{"id":"2230372","text":"Aglipay may refer to the following: *Aglipay, Quirino, a municipality in the Philippines *Gregorio Aglipay, founder of the Philippine Independent Church, also known as the \\"Aglipayan Church\\" ","title":"Aglipay"},{"id":"2230379","text":"The 1st Council of the North-West Territories also known as the North-West Council in Canada lasted from October 7, 1876, to 1888. It was created as a permanent replacement to the Temporary North-West Council which existed prior to 1876 and was replaced by the 1st North-West assembly when the quota of elected members was reached. The numerical denomination 1st was applied when the 2nd Council of the Northwest Territories was created to differentiate between the two councils. ==Early history and development== The first members of the new council were appointed under the Northwest Territories Act and consisted of the Lieutenant Governor, appointed men and Stipendiary Magistrates. Elected representatives were added later and could join the council if an area of had 1000 people an electoral district could be set up. This created a patchwork of represented and unrepresented areas, and there was no official or independent boundaries commission, all electoral law at the beginning was under the purview of the Lieutenant Governor. Three electoral districts were created in 1881 and for an unknown reason writs were only issued in the district of Lorne which returned the first elected member Lawrence Clarke. Electors participating in the Northwest Territories elections did not vote by secret ballot until the 1893 Whitewood by-election. ==Early sessions== When the first council formed under the new appointed government in 1876, the council consisted of the lieutenant governor who acted as the chairman (speaker), and two appointed members. Because a quorum could not be maintained, the council had to be adjourned if one member went to the washroom. ==By-election dates and summaries== Twelve elections took place during the period of 1876‚Äì1888. The biggest was the election of 1885 that took place on September 15, 1885. The election saw 11 members in 9 districts returned to the council, due to high population growth in the Northwest Territories at the time. After the 1885 election, elected members became the majority in the council visa vis the appointed members, although they had to fight to wrest control from the \\"colonial\\" officials. It became a full assembly. These are not considered general elections, as there was no dissolution of the assembly. However, after four years from the first election, a district had to have another election - the seat was declared empty to be filled in an election.

He was a founding member of the 1960s rock group John's Children, and a member of several other bands, including Jook, Jet and Radio Stars. He replaced The Who's Keith Moon on drums on a 1967 UK tour after Moon had injured himself, and he jammed with Jimi Hendrix at the Speakeasy rock club in London. Later in his life Townson quit the music business and became an illustrator and a highly respected social worker. ==Biography== Chris Townson was born in Battersea, London on 24 July 1947. He was abandoned by his parents at the age of four, and spent his early childhood in foster care. In 1958, after passing the entrance exam, the London County Council sent Townson to the Stoatley Rough School in Haslemere, Surrey, where he was resident for two years. In the early 1960s, Townson attended Box Hill School, also in Surrey, and there he met Andy Ellison. Notwithstanding the Beatlemania that was sweeping the country at the time, Townson and Ellison were more interested in the rhythm and blues sound of The Rolling Stones, The Yardbirds and The Who. When Townson saw The Who perform, he said in a magazine interview some years later, \\"that was it, it was this that I wanted to do!\\" In 1965 Townson and Ellison formed a band called the Clockwork Onions, which later became The Few, and then The Silence. The band was Townson (drums), Ellison (vocals), Geoff McClelland (guitar) and John Hewlett (bass guitar). Townson invited The Yardbirds' manager Simon Napier-Bell to see The Silence perform, and while Napier-Bell thought they were \\"dreadful\\", he was impressed by their antics and agreed to manage them. He changed the group's name to John's Children and said they should make their act \\"as outrageous as possible\\" to attract the attention of the press. The band was named after their bass player because he played so badly and Napier-Bell wanted to be sure the band would not fire him. In March 1967 Marc Bolan joined John's Children and Napier-Bell signed them with Track Records, which included artists like The Who and The Jimi Hendrix Experience. John's Children released several singles, including \\"Desdemona\\", which was banned by the BBC because of its lyrics. Their live act, according to Townson, was \\"theatre\\", \\"anarchy\\" and \\"deconstruction\\". They fought each other on stage, used chains, fake blood and feathers, and they trashed their instruments. In general the band \\"whip[ped] the audience into a frenzy\\". In April 1967 John's Children went on a tour of Germany with The Who, also notorious for their own wild stage performances. But John's Children were sent home early because they \\"upstaged\\" The Who, and their act in Ludwigshafen caused a riot in the audience, which nearly prevented The Who from playing. A few months later, however, The Who called on Townson's services when their drummer Keith Moon had injured himself demolishing his own drum kit on stage. Townson drummed with The Who, his \\"all time favourite band\\", in four of their concerts in June 1967. But The Who got their revenge on Townson for John's Children's \\"reckless behaviour\\" on the German tour: at the end of his last gig with them, they \\"blew [him] off the stage\\" with flash powder. John's Children split up in late 1967 after only 18 months, but in that short period of time they had achieved a \\"cult status\\". Townson played in several groups after John's Children, including Jook, Jet and Radio Stars. In the late 1970s Townson quit the music business and built a successful career illustrating album covers and books. Later, and for health reasons, he studied to be a social worker, and worked with the National Children's Home, becoming director of its Phoenix Project. It was Townson's own difficult childhood and the help he had received from social workers at the time that gave him an \\"innate understanding\\" of the children's circumstances. Townson rejoined John's Children when they reformed in the late 1990s for the occasional tour, and recorded a single with them in 2006. He also played on all of (former Jet member) Martin Gordon's solo albums, and also illustrated a book which accompanied one of them, entitled The Illustrated and Annotated 'God's on His Lunchbreak, Please Call Back' Companion Volume. Townson died of cancer in London on 10 February 2008. He was married twice with one son and four daughters. ==References== Category:1947 births Category:2008 deaths Category:People from Battersea Category:People from Leatherhead Category:English drummers Category:British male drummers ","title":"Chris Townson"},{"id":"2230386","text":"Jeonse (), also known as Chonsei, Key Money Deposit or Key Money, is a real estate term unique to South Korea that refers to the way apartments are leased. Instead of paying monthly rent, a renter will make a lump-sum deposit on a rental space, at anywhere from 50% to 80% of the market value. == Operation == Jeonse involves the tenant giving the landlord a large sum of \\"key money\\" when a lease is signed. The amount of money required depends on the economy and the location of the property. Usually the amount required is 50% of the property's value, but can be as high as 60-80%. In 2014, it was reported that the average cost of a Jeonse in Seoul equals to almost $300,000 USD. The tenant is then allowed to stay in the property \\"rent-free\\", not requiring any additional monthly payments, until the end of the lease, which is usually 2 years. Utilities and other costs (water, gas, electricity, cable, phone, internet, security) are applied for and paid by the tenant. The landlord makes a return by taking the deposit money and investing it and keeping all interest earned on the deposit. The tenant's deposit is protected by having a lien issued against the property for the amount given. The entire deposit is then returned to the tenant at the end of the lease. In rare cases where damage has been done to the property, the damage has to be fixed to the landlord's standard before a landlord will return the deposit. This system is popular for two main reasons. First, there are very few mortgages in South Korea , so it is difficult for consumers to own a home. Also, real estate prices continue to increase so fast that some see the situation as a housing bubble. During times of lower interest rates, (ÏõîÏÑ∏), or monthly rent, is more often used. With a lease, a renter signs a lease for 1 or 2 years and makes a deposit on the apartment equal to perhaps 10% of the market value. The renter then pays monthly rent. == Risks == As Jeonse tenants are not obligated to pay any monthly rent, it may lead them to believe that Jeonse is a great deal in all aspects. However, there is a certain level of risks of which the tenants shall be aware for leasing an apartment by Jeonse. === Rising housing market === Jeonse tenants are taking a short position in the housing market in some sense. When the apartment price goes down the amount of Jeonse deposit goes down proportionally, although this may not always be the case. In such circumstances, the tenants will get the difference back when they renew the lease, at least in theory. However, if their landlords fail to provide the difference either with their own money or by taking a loan, the tenants are left with a few difficult options such as a lawsuit. On the other hand, when the apartment price goes up the deposit may go up as well, and the tenants shall fill the gap when they renew the lease. === Variable interest rates === It is a common practice that Jeonse tenants have the deposit ready by taking a loan from a bank due to the sheer amount of the deposit. If they take a loan with a variable annual percentage rate (APR), which is fairly common, they are exposed to the risk of rising interest rates. However, banks are able to provide a very low APR (2-4%) as the deposit may be taken as a collateral. === Dishonest landlords === Some landlords may have a large amount of overdue taxes. In such cases, the government may put the apartment up for auction in an attempt to collect the overdue taxes. When the apartment is sold, the government collects the overdue from the profits from the auction.Ïµú Ìõà. \\"ÏßëÏ£ºÏù∏Ïù¥ Ïïà ÎÇ∏ ÏÑ∏Í∏à, ÏÑ∏ÏûÖÏûêÍ∞Ä ÎÇ∏Îã§?\\" ÏãúÏÇ¨Îß§Í±∞ÏßÑ 2580, MBC News. 2 May, 2016. Since national tax (Íµ≠ÏÑ∏) and local tax (ÏßÄÎ∞©ÏÑ∏) take a higher priority than the tenants, they may lose some or all of their deposit, depending on how much their landlords owes the government. ==See also== *Key money *Real estate in South Korea *Antichresis, (Anticr√©tico in Spanish), a system common in Bolivia, due to limited access to credit. *Mortgage loan ==References * South Korea's housing market strengthens Category:Economy of Korea Category:Real estate terminology ","title":"Jeonse"},{"id":"2230387","text":"Seaside view of Prora Clemens Klotz (31 May 1886 ‚Äì 1969) was one of Adolf Hitler's architects.

The Saltdogs are in the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball, which is not affiliated with Major League Baseball. Since the 2001 season, the Saltdogs have played their home games at Haymarket Park, which they share with the Nebraska Cornhuskers college baseball team. ==History== The Saltdogs were formed when the Madison Black Wolf were sold and moved to Lincoln after the 2000 season. The team was a member of the Northern League from 2001 to 2005. After the 2005 season, the Saltdogs (along with the St. Paul Saints, Sioux City Explorers, and Sioux Falls Canaries) left the Northern League to form the American Association. The Saltdogs claimed their first league title in 2009, winning the American Association championship. Their overall regular-season record was 49‚Äì47, but Lincoln went 27‚Äì21 to claim the second-half North Division title and advanced to the championship by defeating the first-half North Division champion Wichita Wingnuts in the division series, three games to two. The Saltdogs then claimed the title by defeating the South Division champion Pensacola Pelicans three games to two, with game five decided by a 2‚Äì1 score at Pelican Park in Pensacola. Lincoln celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2010, and the team secured its fourth berth in the playoffs over the prior five seasons. The Saltdogs finished with a 51‚Äì45 overall record, the seventh time in ten years Lincoln reached the 50-win plateau, and the ninth time in ten seasons that the team finished above the .500 mark. Although the Saltdogs did not win a division title in 2010, their overall record was still good enough for them to qualify for the postseason via a wild card berth. Lincoln has earned four wild-card playoff berths in its history, with the first three (2001, 2002, and 2005) coming during the team's Northern League days. The Saltdogs made the playoffs in each of their first two years in the American Association. In both 2006 and 2007, they finished with the league's best overall regular-season record, winning three of the four North Division titles (both the first-half and second-half titles in 2006, and the first-half title in 2007). Their 14-game winning streak in 2007 is the longest in team history. The Saltdogs had the best overall record (272‚Äì204) of any team in the first five years of the American Association. Kash Beauchamp was the first manager in Saltdogs history, although his tenure lasted just 42 games into the 2001 season, during which the team went 21‚Äì21 (.500). Pitcher Les Lancaster replaced Beauchamp, guiding Lincoln to playoff berths in both 2001 and 2002. Lancaster served as a player-manager for the first ten days of his managing tenure before moving exclusively to the bench. He led the team to a regular-season record of 86‚Äì53 (.619) and a postseason record of 6‚Äì7. After the 2002 season, Lancaster departed and was replaced by former Toronto Blue Jays manager Tim Johnson. Johnson spent six seasons with the Saltdogs, compiling a 314‚Äì252 (.555) regular-season record and a 2‚Äì9 postseason record. Lincoln made the playoffs three times under Johnson (2005, 2006, and 2007) and won three division championships (American Association 2006 first-half and second-half North Division titles, 2007 first-half North Division title). Johnson resigned as manager at the end of the 2008 season, and was replaced by Marty Scott, who had managed the Triple-A New Orleans Zephyrs during the 2008 season. Scott won two championships between 1995 and 2000 as the manager of the St. Paul Saints and guided Lincoln to the 2009 championship, his fourth overall as a manager. Over two seasons in Lincoln, Scott compiled a 100‚Äì92 (.521) regular-season record and a 6‚Äì7 postseason record. In 2020, the league announced that the Saltdogs were not selected as one of six teams to participate in a condensed season as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. They will go on hiatus for the season, with plans to return in 2021.

These supply food energy but little to no other nutrition in the way of vitamins, minerals, protein, fibre, or essential fatty acids. Fat contributes nine calories per gram, ethanol seven calories, and sugar four calories. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) advises, \\"A small amount of empty calories is okay, but most people eat far more than is healthy.\\" The phrase is derived from low nutrient density, which is the proportion of nutrients in a food relative to its energy content.Marion Nestle and Malden Nesheim (2013) Why Calories Count: From Science to Politics, page 3, Considering energy foods as adequate nutrition was first scientifically demonstrated to be false by Fran√ßois Magendie by experiments on dogs and described in his Pr√©cis √©l√©mentaire de Physiologie. He showed that eating only sugar, olive oil, or butter, each led to the death of his test animals in 30 to 40 days.Magendie, F. (1816) \\"Sur les propri√©t√©s nutritives des substances qui ne contiennent pas d‚Äô azote\\", Annales de Chimie (ser. 2) 3:66-77, 408‚Äì410. ==Examples== The following foods are often considered to contain mostly empty calories and may lead to weight gain: * Sugar: cake, cookies, sweets, candy, soft drinks, fruit-flavored sweet beverages and other foods containing mostly added sugars (including High-fructose corn syrup). * Fat: margarine, shortening and other fats and oils. * Alcohol: beer, wine, hard spirits and other alcoholic beverages. While moderate amounts can lead to weight gain, chronic consumption of large amounts of alcohol can lead to weight loss because alcoholic liver disease is characterized by an increased metabolic rate and impaired muscle protein synthesis, resulting in sarcopenia. ==Impact on other nutrients== A diet high in added sugar typically reduces consumption of foods that contain essential nutrients. One review reported that for increases in consumption of added sugars, nutrients at most risk for inadequacy were vitamins A, C, E, and magnesium. For these, nutrient intake was less with each 5% increase in added sugars intake. A diet high in alcohol can have the same effect. According to one review, \\"Micronutrient deficiencies occur in patients with ALD because the major proportion of calories derived from alcohol lack minerals and vitamins. Specific emphasis is necessary for zinc, vitamin D, thiamine, folate, cyanocobalamin, and selenium.\\" People with ALD also display sarcopenia, but it is not clear if this is due to chronic low protein intake or the disease, which is known to inhibit muscle protein synthesis. ==Allowable intake without impacting health== Food energy intake must be balanced with activity to maintain a proper body weight. Sedentary individuals and those eating less to lose weight may suffer malnutrition if they eat food supplying empty calories but not enough nutrients. In contrast, people who engage in heavy physical activity need more food energy as fuel, and so can have a larger amount of calorie-rich, essential nutrient-poor foods. Dietitians and other healthcare professionals prevent malnutrition by designing eating programs and recommending dietary modifications according to patient's needs. The USDA advises the following levels of empty calorie consumption as an upper limit for individuals who engage in 30 minutes or less of moderate exercise daily. {  - ! Gender !! Age (years) !!

He first appeared in Super Friends #7. His first canon appearance is Infinity, Inc. #32 (November 1986). He is unrelated to the Looney Tunes character, although both characters are owned by divisions of WarnerMedia. ==Fictional character biography== Hugh Dawkins is a born metahuman with the ability to turn into a supernaturally large and intelligent Tasmanian Devil, in a fashion similar to a werewolf. An alternate origin has jokingly been offered, claiming that Hugh's mother was a were-Tasmanian Devil who raised him in a Tasmanian Devil cult, which gave him a Tasmanian Devil amulet after selling his soul to a Tasmanian Devil and injecting him with a radioactive Tasmanian Devil musk from a race of alien Tasmanian Devils which gave him his powers. While Hugh is a pacifist, his alter ego of the Tasmanian Devil is aggressive and bestial. His parents had a hard time with him until he saved his father's life. He works as a superhero in Tasmania until he is contacted by a man named Doctor Mist to join the Global Guardians.Infinity, Inc. #32 (November 1986) He fights alongside the team and other heroes. In one incident, a teamup with Infinity Inc. goes bad when Taz is mentally forced to help a murderous villain gain revenge on a casino.\\"Infinity Inc.\\" #35‚Äì37 (1987) Later, the Guardians' base is destroyed and the team disbands. ===League and Guardians=== Dawkins helps to rebuild the Justice League Embassy which had been destroyed during an alien invasion.Justice League International Annual #3 (1989) His affiliation with the Justice League causes his rejection by the Queen Bee, ruler of Bialya, who is reforming the Guardians.Justice League Europe Annual #1 (1990) Her efforts seem beneficial but are for her own selfish gain, as she is using brainwashing techniques to put the Guardians under her control. This affects the Devil again, as his close friend Tuatara falls into a coma after destroying a neo-Nazi compound and attacking the League. Tuatara receives care by an Australian medical facility. Dawkins and his friend Joshua Barbazon are preparing the Justice League Australian embassy. Their plans include transferring Tuatara to the medical lab, as soon as it is completed. The Queen Bee recalls Tuatara before this happens. Dawkins is infuriated by these circumstances, which he doesn't fully understand. Dawkins would be there when Tuatara recovers his true mind. Called up in a League effort to stop an international incident, Dawkins and many other League members travel to Bialya.Justice League America #54 (September 1991) It turns out that Captain Atom, Elongated Man, Ice and Blue Beetle had been fired by Ambassador Heimlich, a mole placed into UN power by the Queen Bee. They had illegally invaded Bialya to investigate.Justice League Europe #30 (September 1991) The backup team enters, with the permission of Queen Bee, just in time to be caught in a devastating explosion, which destroys an entire city block. The League and many innocent people are saved by Ice creating a shield, but so many others are not so lucky. Dawkin's former friends regain their minds, and the Bee's massive brainwashing efforts are uncovered. He also learns that Doctor Mist was a robot, Jack O'Lantern is dead but an impostor, and Owlwoman is missing. It is said that Little Mermaid is also missing, though both sides in the conflict had seen her die from a misfired shot by Lantern. Queen Bee, the one that has caused so much problems is deposed and slain by Sumaan Harjavti, the brother of the man the Queen had slain and deposed.Justice League America #55 (October 1991) Dawkins and the League help with relief and recovery efforts.Justice League America #56 (November 1991) After this he would return to Australia, but he rejoins a team of Guardians to rescue those still endangered by the secret machinations of Harjavti.Justice League Quarterly #7 (Summer 1992) The entire group is endangered as those left behind had been implanted with subliminal orders to kill. Fortunately, nobody is actually harmed and the Guardians are reformed again.Justice League Quarterly #8 (Fall 1992) Taz assists with clean up efforts after Coast City is obliterated.Superman vol. 2 #83 (November 1993) He rejoins Justice League International after aiding them against the villain Sonar.Justice League Europe #50 (May 1993) He is present for the funeral of fellow Leaguer Ice.Justice League America vol. 1 #91 (August 1994) He becomes indirectly involved in another recruitment effort but it doesn't work out.\\"Justice League Task Force\\" Vol 1 #15 (August 1994) It is also revealed that Hugh is openly gay in Justice League Quarterly #8 (1992). He has previously been romantically interested in JLA liaison Joshua Barbizon, had a crush on Hal Jordan and is dating Starman, Mikaal Thomas.Robinson, James. Starman/Congorilla #1 (2010) ===Bloodlines=== Later, Dawkins works with the Justice League during the Bloodlines event. He teams up, mainly with Elongated Man and Metamorpho to stop a group of murderous aliens terrorizing London. The other adult female team members, Power Girl and Doctor Light, are unavailable to assist due to previous commitments. The men are not very successful as dozens of citizens vanish or are killed. The toll, which includes a missing school bus, deeply affects all three. During one investigation, they are attacked by the rookie armored hero Lionheart, who mistakes Taz's unusual form (and the changing forms of his friends) for the eyewitness reports of the aliens. The aliens attack the League's headquarters, a (seemingly haunted) castle. Summoned by the energy flares of their youngest member, Maya, the group returns and fights the creatures. Lionheart, though his secondary mission is to discredit the League, sees the nobility in Taz and the others and helps them chase off the aliens. No pursuit is possible, as all are injured; Taz himself has been impaled through the shoulder. Lionheart, before fainting from his injuries, summons medical help through an emergency Justice League communications channel.Justice League International Annual vol. 2 #4 (1993) Taz recovers in time to help his JLE teammates and dozens of other heroes defeat the Bloodlines aliens. The aliens are destroyed in a swamp outside of Metropolis in America.Bloodbath #1‚Äì2 (1993) ===Funerals and Risk=== Around this time, Dawkins goes on a JLI goodwill tour to New Zealand. They resist him at first. He and his contact, Raylene Mackenzie, stumble upon the villain Phobia and Tas literally sniffs out one of her recent murders. The two get into a back-and- forth fight with the fear-casting killer. Raylene confronts a fear of drowning, while Tas' hallucination concerns the abusive treatment his mother heaped upon his father. Working together, the two defeat Phobia. Tas' efforts to save a New Zealander endears him to the entire country.Justice League Quarterly #15 (Summer 1994) Dawkins later assists the Justice League in battling Overmaster.Justice League America #89 & 90, Justice League Task Force #13 & 14, Justice League International (vol. 2) #65 & 66 (June & July 1994) There, the team loses Ice.Justice League Task Force #14 (July 1994) The group falls apart, and Dawkins soon leaves too, not wanting to stay in a group so small and unestablished. He does not see the point.Justice League International vol. 2 #68 (September 1994) Tas is one of the mourners at the funeral for Maxwell Lord.Justice League America #96 (February 1995) After some time missing, he is shown attending the funeral of Sue Dibny, wife of the Elongated Man.Identity Crisis #1 (August 2004) He joins the Ultramarine Corps and lives for a time on their floating city of Superbia. When the entire city is conquered by Gorilla Grodd and his forces, Tas and the other surviving heroes are sent to cause destruction.JLA: Classified #2 (February 2005) His mind and the Corps are rescued by the Justice League.JLA: Classified #3 (March 2005) Soon after, he takes part in the Corps' mission into the infant universe sometimes known as Nebula Man. Their efforts later allow the villain to be destroyed. Tas helps out in the OMAC Crisis. He is one of many superheroes who go to the Sahara as bait for the legions of meta-human killing machines. This scheme works, and many OMACs are destroyed without harming the hosts within.OMAC Project #6 (November 2005) After the events of Infinite Crisis, Tas is shown at a memorial service/headcount.52 #1 (May 2006) During the 52 maxi-series, Tas and other powered beings, including Gloss and Manticore, face a rage-maddened Black Adam in Sydney, Australia. They are shown unconscious and buried in debris.52 #50 (June 2007) Later, Tas once again rejoins the Global Guardians.Green Lantern (2005) #10 (May 2006) In Detective Comics #852 (2008), Tas makes a brief appearance fighting hostile gunmen on the streets of Australia. ===Death and return=== In the 2009 mini-series Justice League: Cry for Justice, it is revealed that Tas was skinned, and his pelt was made into a rug by the villain Prometheus.Robinson, James. Justice League: Cry For Justice #3 (September 2009) In the 2011 Starman/Congorilla one-shot, it is revealed that Prometheus had his body put into a stasis pod. He was fully healed and awakened after a citizen of Gorilla City named Malavar placed his comatose body in a Lazarus Pit. He rises from the Pit just in time to help Starman, Congorilla, Malavar and Animal Man fight a group of enemies, and then returns to Australia to tell his mother that he is still alive. Following his resurrection, Tas appears as a member of the Justice League's reserve roster during the battle against Eclipso's shadow army.Justice League of America vol. 2 #56 ===New 52 and DC Rebirth=== In Midnighter and Apollo it is implied he is not only resurrected but married to Gregorio de la Vega, who refers to his husband as a therianthrope and named Hugh.Midnighter and Apollo #6 In the Watchmen sequel Doomsday Clock, Tasmanian Devil is listed as a member of the Australian superhero team called the Sleeping Soldiers.Doomsday Clock #6 (July 2018).

Accessed 8 October 2018. ==History== Lithograph of Paleis Rijswijk in the 1880s. View of the reception hall of the palace in 1920s ===The beginning=== Construction of the building started in 1796. It was built by Jacob Andries van Braam, a Dutchman who between 1810 and 1819 held several high positions in government, to be made his own residence. It was an elegant two-floored building designed in Indies Empire style, a popular style of architecture during the late 18th-century. The building was built in the neighborhood of Rijswijk-Molenvliet (present Harmoni), which was among the most exclusive neighborhood in Batavia's Bovenstad (\\"uptown\\") at that time. The building was built during the tenure of Governor General Pieter Gerardus van Overstraten, shortly after the completion of another lavish residence which later would become Hotel der Nederlanden. Construction took several years, and the building was finally completed in 1804.ISTANA-ISTANA KEPRESIDENAN REPUBLIK INDONESIA, setneg.go.id ===The English period=== Upon the completion of the building, the building was handed over to Hugh Hope, then the British Commissioner when the country under the British rule. Van Braam lived in a smaller wing to the south of the building throughout his life. ===Residence of the Governor-General=== After the death of J.A. van Braam, the house was brought over by the Dutch Government in 1816. The government used this building as the center of all administration and as the official residence of the Governor-General during a stay in Batavia. The much larger building that was intended by Daendels to become the official residence of the governor-general of the Dutch Indies in Waterlooplein was delayed, and so it was never used as a residence for the governor-general, even after its completion in 1828.Palace of Daendels , jakarta.go.id As the official residence of the governor-general, van Braam's residence was officially named Hotel van den Gouverneur-Generaal (Hotel of the Governor-General). Important occasions such as formal ceremonies or the Indies Council Meeting on every Wednesday were held in the palace. Godert van der Capellen became the first governor-general to officially reside in the palace in 1820. However Bogor Palace (Paleis te Buitenzorg) in Bogor (Buitenzorg) became the main residence, as most of the governor generals preferred the temperate climate in the hillsides of Bogor. In 1848, the first floor of the building was removed and the room which faced the Koningsplein was redesigned to be more open to the exterior. ===Expansion: Istana Merdeka=== Later the palace became too cramped with increasing administrative need, and thus a new palace was planned in 1869. The new palace was completed in 1873 facing Koningsplein (King's Square) and it would be known as Koningsplein Palace. Together the palace would form the Governor-General's palace compound in Rijswijk. In 1875, the complex was equipped with new iron fencing. Additional houses were built to accommodate the officials of the Palace. ===Japanese occupation=== In 1942, the Japanese successfully invaded the Dutch East Indies. Governor-General Tjarda Van Starkenborch signed a capitulation to the Japanese army in the palace on 8 March 1942. Under the Japanese, the palace became the residence of the Saiko Shikikan (army commander) until the Japanese surrender in 1945. After the independence, the lion emblem of the Netherlands on the front facade of the building was removed. Since its existence, many important events took place in this building. Some of which include the declaration of the cultuur stelsel system by the Governor-General Graaf van den Bosch, the ratification ceremony of the Linggadjati Agreement on 25 March 1947 and the recognition of Indonesia's independence on 27 December 1949. ==Role of the Palace and Feature== State banquet in Istana Negara during President Obama's visit in 2010 The architecture of the Merdeka Palace was done in a style known as the Indies Empire style, a popular style of architecture in the early 19th-century Batavia. During the early days, the 3.375 m¬≤ building had two stories. In 1848, the upper floor was partly demolished, and the lower expanded to accommodate more individuals, and thus present a more formal portrayal. The palace mainly functions as the main venue for stately ceremonial activities such as appointments of ministers, conference and national meeting opening ceremonies, the opening of international and national congresses, national banquets and cultural performances. It also serves as an administrative office for the Head of state. The front part of the palace contains the main reception hall, which is used mainly for Gifts of State exchanges and is located next to the banquet hall. Other chambers in the palace consist of a front room, a living room, a suite for the vice-president, a guest waiting room and the president's office. The palace consists of 2 main audience halls named Ruang Upacara and Ruang Jamuan, each connected with a corridor decorated with various paintings. During the colonial era, Ruang Upacara (Ceremonial Hall) was formerly a ballroom. As its name states, the room is used for formal ceremonial events in the palace. In the room there are Javanese and Balinese Gamelan sets used for cultural performance purposes and a podium. The Ruang Jamuan (Banquet Hall) is used to provide hospitality and repasts to state guests within the palace. It has a capacity of 150 people and is decorated with a painting of Ratu Kidul by Basoeki Abdullah. ==See also== * List of colonial buildings and structures in Jakarta * Cipanas Palace * Vice Presidential Palace (Indonesia) * List of palaces in Indonesia ==ReferencesWorks cited== * * ==External links== * Istana Negara profile * Istana Negara history Category:Presidential palaces in Indonesia Category:Buildings and structures in Jakarta Category:Colonial architecture in Jakarta Category:Cultural Properties of Indonesia in Jakarta Category:Central Jakarta Category:State guesthouses Category:Government buildings completed in 1804 Category:1804 establishments in Asia ","title":"Istana Negara (Jakarta)"},{"id":"2230475","text":"Plaridel can refer to: *the penname of Marcelo H. del Pilar *Arellano University ‚Äì Plaridel Campus *J.

He followed a military career. Although he never played any political role, as a relative of Tsar Nicholas II, he was executed by firing squad at the walls of Peter and Paul Fortress during the Russian Civil War. ==Early life== Grand Duke Dmitry Konstantinovich was born at Strelna on 13 June 1860, the third son and fifth child of Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia and Grand Duchess Alexandra Iosifovna, born Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg. When Dmitry turned 7 his education was turned over to Alexei Zelenoy, an officer who had served under his father in the Imperial Navy. Grand Dukes Konstantin and Dmitry Konstantinovich His lessons followed the usual course: science, arithmetic, Russian and world history, composition, and geography alternating languages and the arts. He learned besides Russian, French, German and English. Like all the male members of the Romanov family, he was destined from birth to follow a military career. At his christening, Dmitry was named honorary colonel in Chief, a month later he was enrolled in the Guard Equipage, and in the Imperial family's 4th Rifle Battalion Life Guards Infantry Regiment.King & Wilson, Gilded Prism, p. 92 Dmitry's father, Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich, was Admiral General of the Russian Navy and hoped one of his sons would follow in his footsteps. With this in mind, Dmitry received lessons in naval warfare and tactics. His religious education left a big imprint on him. He would be a deeply religious man all his life. As both of his parents were musical, he received singing lesson and learned to play the piano and the violin. Dmitry was a diligent and good student, polite and attentive, capable and kind. He was also very shy and introverted, preferring quiet times reading to more usual pursuits of childhood.King & Wilson, Gilded Prism, p. 93 ==Formative years== Grand Duke Dmitry in his early youth His parents' marriage was unhappy and Dmitry was still a child when his father started a new family with his mistress, a Russian ballerina. A second family setback scared him even further. Dmitry was 14 when his eldest brother Nikolai Konstantinovich was disinherited, declared insane and sent into internal Russian exile, after stealing some diamonds from an icon in his mother's bedroom. Grand Duchess Alexandra Iosifovna made her three remaining sons: Konstantin age 16, Dmitry 14, and Vyacheslav 12, promise her that they would never drink, never give themselves to a life of self- indulgence, never forget that all the privileges of their wealth and rank were meant for use and not enjoyment. Brought up under these conditions, the younger Konstantinovich grand dukes grew into thoughtful, introspective men Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 208 At the age of 15, Dmitry, with his younger brother Vyacheslav, was enrolled as a cadet aboard the tender Kadetski. Together the two brothers underwent the rigors of life at sea. During their training cruises through the Gulf of Finland, they spent their time drilling, standing watch, and taking turns leading their fellow cadets. In 1877, the 17-year-old Dmitry made his first official public appearance as a member of the Imperial family, he joined Alexander II with his father and cousins Grand Duke Sergei and Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich on a journey to southern Russia in the aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War, 1877‚Äì1878. Vyacheslav and Konstantin with their sister Grand Duchess Vera Dmitry soon disappointed his father's wishes when he decided to abandon his career in the Navy in favor of the Imperial Army. He used the interval of an illness to ask his father to allow him to join the army. It was a blow to Konstantin to see his third consecutive son to leave the navy, but Dmitry begged his father and with the intervention of Alexandra Iosifovna, he was eventually allowed to leave the Navy and join the Horse Guards regiment in 1879. Like his parents, Dmitry was musical; he had a particular love for Russian church music. In later years, he often sang in the chapel choirs at Strelna, the Marble Palace and the Pokrovsky Convent in Kiev. Duty stood at the core of his being and he was fiercely critical of a system, which pushed members of the Imperial family forward simply because of who they were. He believed that their promotions should be earned Intensely shy, Dmitry preferred to avoid society, but on summer evenings at Petergof he often rode from Strelna to Znamenka, the house of his cousin, Grand Duke Pyotr where he was a welcome guest. Peter's wife, Grand Duchess Militsa, played the piano while Dmitry was usually persuaded to join in, accompanying with his own singing of Russian folk songs. ==Military career== Grand Duke Dmitry, 1891 On 1 June 1880, Dmitry Konstantinovich was appointed to the suite of Alexander II and given the rank of Fligel-Adjutant. Six months later, after completing his initial infantry training, the grand duke was appointed lieutenant in the Horse Guards Regiment. He was to serve with the Horse Guards for twelve years as a junior officer, and finally as commander. After completing a training course with the General Staff Academy in 1880, Dmitry Konstantinovich was promoted to Ordnance Officer and scheduled to make his first official appearance, when he would deliver the report as an Imperial Adjutant in the Guards Sappers Cavalry Regiment. The date for his first appearance was Sunday, 1 March 1881. Two hours after the review, his uncle Alexander II, who had been present at the insistence of Alexandra Iosifovna, was assassinated. In November 1881, Alexander III promoted Dmitry Konstantinovich to the position of Adjutant in the H. I. M. Retinue. Celebrating Dmitry's majority on 26 November of that year was delayed owing the assassination of Alexander II. The ceremony took place later and coincided with the Grand Duke Pavel Alexandrovich and Grand Duke Mikhail Mikhailovich taking an oath to the Emperor.King & Wilson, Gilded Prism, p. 94 Through the 1880s, Dmitry Konstantinovich served with his regiment with unceasing energy and an eye toward correcting grievances from his men. He built himself a two- storied dacha at Krasnoye Selo, equipping the property with stables and exercise yard for the horses. Here he spent the summers with his regiment; in spring and fall, he invariably invited his regimental officers to his Palace, Strelna, which he inherited on the death of his father in 1892. Mornings were spent riding through the park in which, the grand duke put his men and their horses through intricate maneuvers; after lunch, he would lead the officers on walks through the exquisite gardens. On 6 April 1889, the grand duke was promoted to the rank of captain and given command of the 2nd Squadron of the Horse Guards. Three years later, on 10 December 1892, he was promoted to the rank of colonel and owing to his distinguished service, he was given command of the House Guards Grenadiers Regiment by Alexander III. Dmitry was a popular commander, and a tough and demanding officer. He took pride in his soldiers, and was greatly concerned with their welfare. ==Russian Grand Duke== Grand Duke Dmitry. The bearded man in front of him is Tsar Alexander III, 1893 Dmitry was very religious and he assumed responsibility for the church of the Apparition of the Virgin near Strelna, which was the regimental church of the Horse Grenadiers. He commissioned both an enlargement and a renovation program, which he paid for himself. The grand duke's main residence was the splendid Palace of Strelna, where he lived a quiet and misanthropic life and was his main residence until the revolution. He lived in a suite of rooms of the ground floor on the west wing that had previously been occupied by his father. He had the palace electrified, telephones were installed and modern plumbing provided for the bathroom and the kitchen. Dmitry Konstantinovich was fair, with blond hair and blue eyes, and wore a small cavalry mustache.Chavchavadze, The Grand Dukes, p. 153 He was tall and lean with long legs and a long neck that increased his extraordinary height. In a family known for the height of its male members, Dmitry was among the tallest. Grand Duchess Militsa considered him \\"the nicest and best among the grand dukes\\". He was proper, dignified and very refined in his manners. Alexander Mosolov, head of Nicholas II's Court Chancellery, described him as \\"full of good sense\\", remarking that Dmitry Konstantinovich \\"was the one among all the grand dukes who was most deeply imbued with the sense of his duty as a Prince and a cousin of the Emperor\\". One day, the grand duke dispatched a hefty portion of his annual civil list income to support a struggling church. When Mosolov learnt of this he warned, \\" If you make gifts everywhere on this scale, your revenues will not last.\\" But Dmitry Konstantinovich replied that the stipend was \\"not intended to enable us to live as sybarites; this money is put into our hands in order that we may augment the prestige of the Imperial family\\".King & Wilson, Gilded Prism, p. 96 The grand duke was a lifelong bachelor, never involved in scandals. His cousin Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich accused him of misogyny in his book of memoirs, but this was contradicted with the close affective relationships he had with female members of his family. He was adored by his family and especially by his young nieces and nephews, with whom he would happily play and ride for hours. He was particularly close to the children of his brother Konstantin. His nephew Prince Gabriel Konstantinovich remembered him, as a \\"wonderful, kind person\\" who was almost a second father and wherever they saw him, they ran across the room, jumping up to hug him and wrap their arms around his neck. Dmitry Konstantinovich also loved to tease the children and play practical jokes on them. Prince Oleg, Grand Duke Konstantin, Grand Duchess Yelizaveta Mavrakievna, Prince Konstantin, Olga, Queen of the Hellenes, Prince Igor, Princess Tatiana.(standing):Prince Gabriel, Grand Duke Dmitry, Prince Ioann and Prince Christopher of Greece. Under Nicholas II, the grand duke received further promotions. On 26 May 1896, he was raised to the rank of Major-General, and three months later, he was named General √† la suite in the Imperial Entourage. On 19 December 1904, Dmitry Konstantinovich was promoted to Lieutenant General and appointed Adjutant General to Nicholas II. Nicholas II also appointed the grand duke general director of the Imperial Stud in 1896. Despite his love of the military, it was this later post that struck the deepest chord in Dmitry Konstantinovich. On learning of his appointment, the grand duke ‚Äî whom one courtier termed \\"timid beyond imagination\\" declared, \\" I should have eagerly accepted the appointment if it only meant looking after horses‚Ä¶ I am afraid I shall never get on properly with officials.\\"King & Wilson, Gilded Prism, p. 97 Dmitry Konstantinovich was entranced with his new position, one of which demanded that he traveled across Russia and Europe, selecting the finest horses. Acting on his advice, the Imperial Stud purchased Galtee More, who had won the Derby in Great Britain, for an astronomical 200,000 rubles; as soon as he arrived in Russia, the thoroughbred was put to stud at Tsarskoye Selo. Dmitry Konstantinovich held the post until 1905, when he was replaced with Major-General Alexei Zdnovich. On 10 January 1904, Dmitry Konstantinovich relinquished command of the Horse Guard grenadiers Regiment. Although he would have been happy to remain in his post, his eyesight was failing rapidly, in detriment to his military career. Reluctantly he recognized that by remaining he was depriving another, more capable man of advancement. On leaving active service, the grand duke generously gave his dacha at Krasnoye Selo to the Horse Guards Regiment, to be used as an officer's club. ==Retirement== From left to right : Grand Duke Dmitry, Grand Duke Konstantin, Princess Tatiana, Grand Duchess Alexandra Iosifovna on a bath chair. On the floor Princes Konstantin, Igor and Oleg. standing in the back Queen Olga, Grand Duchess Vera, Prince Ivan, Grand Duchess Yelizaveta Maravkievana, Prince Gabriel and Prince Christopher of Greece on sailor suit. The grand duke's retirement allowed him to focus solely on his passion for horses. Dmitry Konstantinovich created a model equestrian center, the Dubrovsky Stud farm, outside the Village of Mirgord, in the Poltava province. In 1911, Dmitry became president of the Imperial Society of Horse Racing, and was named Honorary president of the Russian society of Care and Protection of Animals. In the autumn of 1913, he inaugurated the Russian Imperial Horse Exposition in Kiev, and the first Russian Sport Competition, a kind of Slavic Olympic Games. With time, the grand duke frequently retreated to Crimea, where he enjoyed the last, carefree years of the Romanov dynasty along the Black Sea shores. In 1907 he purchased a small plot of land at Gaspara in the Crimea, the following year he commissioned the construction of Kichkine, from the Tartar word \\"tiny Jewel\\". The villa was designed in Moorish style and built with local whitewashed stone. Here the grand duke and his guest spent many pleasant evenings watching the sunset over the Black Sea, unaware that the sun was also setting over their privileged way of life.King & Wilson, Gilded Prism, p. 99 Dmitry's mother died in 1911, at her funeral the grand duke's poor eyesight became the source of temporary mirth at the end of the ceremony when he tried to kiss the icon his mother held in her hands. Unable to see clearly, he misjudged the distance and, bending forward to make his farewell, missed the open coffin completely, tumbling off the steps with a loud crash as his ceremonial saber and medals struck the stone floor. Relatives rushed to his side, but the grand duke appeared unfazed and went on as though nothing had happened. ==War and Revolution== Grand Duke Dmitry at Strelna Dmitry had anticipated a clash with Germany for years and was not surprised at the outbreak of World War I. By then, he was almost blind which kept him from participating in the conflict, and he had to content himself with a job training the cavalry regiments away from the field of action. Never meddling in politics, Dmitry Konstantinovich remained silent in the turmoil that preceded the fall of the Romanovs, believing it was not his place to offer unsolicited advice to Nicholas II.King & Wilson , Gilded Prism, p. 163 Dmitry was at his estate of Kichkin in Crimea when he learned that Rasputin had been murdered. He was outraged that members of the Imperial family, among them his sister Olga, Queen of the Hellenes, had signed and sent a plea for leniency on behalf of Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich to the Emperor. He said that had he been in Petrograd at the time, he would have never signed the letter. The grand duke was in Petrograd when the revolution broke out in late February 1917. In spite of the uncertainty of the times, he had purchased a large mansion on Petrogradsky Quay in Petrograd.King & Wilson , Gilded Prism, p. 164 He was staying there when he learned of Nicholas II's abdication and the declaration of the provisional government. After the fall of his family from power, he lived quietly, in obscurity, depending largely on Alexander Koronchentzov, his trusted Adjutant, for the necessities of daily life. His niece Princess Tatiana, who had lost her husband during the war, was living with him. ==Internal exile== Grand Duke Dmitry Konstantinovich After the successful Bolshevik coup of November 1917, the Petrograd newspapers published a decree summoning all the Romanovs to report to the dreaded Cheka, the secret police. Initially they were just required not to leave the city. In March 1918 the Romanovs registered were summoned again now to be sent away. Dmitry went accompanied by Colonel Alexander Korochenzov, his adjutant and his niece Princess Tatiana Constantinovna, who insisted in going with him to ensure that he was not alone and subjected to unwanted pressure. The Bolshevik leaders of Petrograd, Grigory Zinoviev (born Radomyslsky-Apfelbaum) and Moisei Uritsky, decided to send the male members of the Romanov family into internal Russian exile. Fearing the eventual occupation of Petrograd by the Germans, they moved the capital to Moscow. Dmitry was offered a choice for exile: Vologda, Olonets, or Vyatka. He chose Vologda, the closest city to the former Imperial Capital. On 18 April, Dmitry, carrying a suitcase and in the company of his niece, Princess Tatiana, her two children, the children's nanny, and his Adjutant Colonel Korochentzov, boarded a train and left Petrograd for exile. In Vologda, Dmitry Konstantinovich took two rooms in a house owned by a local merchant, just opposite the river. He lived in one room with Colonel Korochentzov, while Tatiana and the children occupied the other. They were not registered in their movement, and were able to walk about town at will. Shortly after they arrival, they learned that Grand Dukes Nicholas and Georgy Mikhailovich had also been exiled to the town. The prisoners enjoyed relative freedom; aside from having to report to Cheka Headquarters once a week, they could come and go as they wished, and took long walks around the town, visiting and dining with each other frequently. In the middle of May, Colonel Alexander von Leiming, one of Dmitry Konstantinovich's adjutants, arrived in Vologda with news that passage had been prepared to Finland, but the grand duke refused to leave Russia King & Wilson , Gilded Prism, p. 181 This quiet and uncertain situation was abruptly interrupted on 14 July, two days before the murder of Nicholas II and his family. That morning a car with four heavily armed men arrived and collected the Grand Dukes from their lodgings; they were transported to a small, walled village, where they could be more easily guarded.King & Wilson , Gilded Prism, p. 182 Grand Duke Georgy wrote to his wife in England, \\"We were each given a cell, and later on were joined by Dmitry. I saw him arriving through the iron bars of my window, and was struck by his sad expression. The first twenty-four hours were hard, but after that, they luckily allowed us to have our camp beds and also our clothes. There is no one in the prison but we three\\". They were guarded, by soldiers from the Baltic provinces. \\"They treat us like comrades, and have not locked our cells after the second day, while they allow us to walk in the small garden in the courtyard. Our food is brought from outside\\". While imprisoned, they learned that Nicholas II and his family had been killed; this seemed to indicate the worst and princess Tatiana left Vologda with her two young children to return to Petrograd. Then on 21 July, all of the exiled Grand Dukes in Vologda were again transferred back to Petrograd. In the former Imperial capital, the men were quickly imprisoned with six other detainees in a cell at Cheka Headquarters. ==Captivity== Dmitry Konstantinovich lived a quiet life devoid of scandal and controversy. Upon arrival, Dmitry Konstantinovich and the other grand dukes were questioned at length by Moisei Uritsky, the Chairman of the Petrograd Cheka. Grand Duke Georgy wrote \\" Dmitry asked Uritsky why we were imprisoned, and his answer was that it was to save us as the people intended shooting us at Vologda\\", an explanation hard to believe. The prisoners were photographed, and then moved to the Kresty prison. Shortly thereafter, they were transferred to Shpalernaya prison, where they would remain for most of their incarceration. Here each had his own private cell, if only seven feet long and three feet wide. Their only furniture was a hard iron bed. The Grand Dukes were permitted to exercise a half-hour to 45 minutes twice a day, although the personal contact allowed in Vologda was denied them here at first. Their wardens, all of whom were soldiers, treated them well; they even helped the grand dukes smuggle out letters. After several days they were all allowed to gather in the courtyard and were permitted some provisions from the outside such as fresh linens and cigarettes. Their day began at 7 am when they were awakened by the steps in the hall of their jailers and the clank of their keys in the door. Lunch was served at noon, which consisted of dirty hot water with a few fish bones in it and black bread. The lights were turned on in the cells at 7 pm, although as the winter approached, the prisoners had to sit in darkness until that time. The meetings of the grand dukes during exercise gave them opportunity to exchange a few words. Prince Gavril Konstantinovich was in a cell adjoining theirs; he was shocked at his uncle Dmitry's appearance when they were first reunited. Until the last, Gavril recalled, Dmitry was the cheerful favorite uncle of his childhood, telling him jokes, attempting to raise the spirits, and bribing prison Guards to carry hopeful messages to his nephew's cell. Some of their relatives made frantic efforts in their behalf to obtain their release through Maxim Gorky who was sympathetic and asked Lenin to set them free. Near the end of 1918, Prince Gavril, who was sick, was eventually permitted to leave and found his way out of Russia. Colonel von Leiming regularly sent food each day for Grand Duke Dmitry; on 29 January 1919, it was returned to him with a note the grand duke was no longer being held prisoner. The following day he learned that he had been executed. ==Execution== There are no eyewitness accounts of the execution. What is known is based on versions that are derived from rumors and second hand information. They vary on the details, some have an overly dramatic air about them, but they all have a similar ring. At 11:30 pm on the night of 27‚Äì28 January, guards awoke Grand Dukes Dmitry Konstantinovich, and Nikolai Mikhailovich and Georgy Mikhailovich, in their cells at Shpalernaya prison, telling them that they were going to be moved and they had to pack their belongings.White Crow: Cockfield, Jamie H, p. 244. They initially assumed that they were going to be transported to Moscow. Grand Duke Nikolai Mikhailovich even thought that they might set free, but his brother Georgy said that it was more likely they were heading to another place to be shot. The Grand Dukes had an ominous hint of what was going to happen to them, when at the time of departure, they were told to leave their luggage. The grand dukes were taken outside and loaded into a truck that already held four common criminals and six Red Guardsmen. At 1:20 am on 28 January they left the prison. They drove towards the river by the fields of Mars, where the truck stalled. While the driver was trying to restart it, one of the convicts tried to run and was shot in the back as he fled. The truck eventually began running again, and they drove to the fortress set up at the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Cathedral. The prisoners were roughly pushed from the truck into the Trubetskoy bastion. They were told to remove their shirts and coats, By then they had no doubt what was about to occur and the grand Dukes embraced each other for the last time. Some different soldiers appeared carrying another person, whom the grand dukes finally recognized as their cousin Grand Duke Pavel Alexandrovich. They were then each escorted arm in arm with a soldier on each side towards a trench that had been dug in the courtyard. As they passed the cathedral of Saint Peter and Saint Pavel where their ancestors were buried, the Grand Dukes crossed themselves. The prisoners were lined up before the ditch, in which there were already 13 bodies, Nikolai Mikhailovich who had been carrying his cat, handed it to a soldier asking him to look after it. All of the grand dukes faced death with the greatest courage.\\"White Crow\\": Cockfield, Jamie H, p. 245. Georgy and Dmitry prayed quietly, Dmitry for the forgiveness of his murderers \\"Forgive them, for they know not what they do\\" The Grand Dukes: Chavchavadze, p. 154. seemed to be his last words. Pavel, who was very sick, was shot on a stretcher. Grand Dukes Nikolai, Georgy and Dmitry were killed by the same blast. The fusillade of shots sent their bodies reeling into the trench. Although the bodies of the other three grand dukes were thrown into a mass grave within the fortress, that of Dmitry Konstantinovich was secretly collected the next morning by his devoted former Adjutant, von Leiming, rolled up in a rug and taken away for a private burial in the garden of a house in Petrograd, where he remains to this day.King & Wilson, Gilded Prism, p. 184 ==Honours and awards== The Grand Duke received several Russian and foreign decorations: ;Russian *Knight of the Order of St. Andrew *Knight of the Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky *Knight of the Order of St. Anna *Knight (first class) of the Order of Saint Stanislaus *Knight of the Order of the White Eagle ;Foreign *Knight of the Order of the Most Holy Annunciation - July 1902 - during a visit to Russia of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy *Order of Saint Sava (Kingdom of Serbia) *Order of the Cross of Takovo (Kingdom of Serbia) *Order of Prince Danilo I (Principality of Montenegro) ==AncestryNotesBibliography== * Alexander, Grand Duke of Russia, Once a Grand Duke, Cassell, London, 1932. * Chavchavadze, David, The Grand Dukes, Atlantic, 1989, *Cockfield, Jamie H.

It is located on the north side of the Merdeka Square in Central Jakarta, Indonesia and is used as the official residence of the President of the Republic of Indonesia. The palace was a residence for the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies during the colonial era. In 1949, the palace was renamed Merdeka Palace, \\"(ke)merdeka(an)\\" meaning \\"freedom\\" or \\"independence\\". The Merdeka Palace is part of the Jakarta Presidential Palace Complex, which also includes the Negara Palace, Wisma Negara (state guest house), Sekretariat Negara (State Secretariat), and the Bina Graha building. It is the center of the Indonesian executive authority.Mengenal Kecantikan Dua Istana Kepresidenan , djamandoeloe.com ==HistoryThe beginning=== Lithograph of the Paleis te Koningsplein in the 1880s (now Merdeka Palace) Reception room of the Palace in 1936 Interior of the Palace in 1936 The building that is now the Merdeka Palace was built in the premise of the Rijswijk Palace (present Istana Negara) when it was considered no longer sufficed for administrative purposes e.g. big receptions and conferences during the mid-19th-century. In 1869, the instruction to construct a new palace was given by Governor-General Pieter Mijer. Construction took place on the south lawn of the Rijswijk Palace on 23 March 1873 during the tenure of Governor-General James Loudon. The Neo-Palladian palace was designed by Jacobus Bartholomeus Drossaers and was built by the Department of Public Works and the contracting firm Drossaers & Company at a cost of ∆í 360,000. The new building was built in southern part of the Rijswijk Palace grounds, directly facing Koningsplein (now Merdeka Square). Construction of the palace was finished in 1879 during the tenure of Governor-General Johan Wilhelm van Lansberge. The new palace was given the official name Paleis van de Gouverneur Generaal (\\"Palace of the Governor-General\\"), the official residence of the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies and his family.ISTANA-ISTANA KEPRESIDENAN REPUBLIK INDONESIA, setneg.go.id Governor-General Johan Wilhelm van Lansberge (1875-1881) was the first to reside in the building. Governor- General Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer (1936-1942) was the last Dutch governor-general to reside in the Palace. ===Japanese occupation=== During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia (1942-1945), the Saiko Shikikan (army commander) of the Japanese garrison resided in the Rijswijk Palace compound. Three Japanese commanders have taken residence in the Merdeka Palace. ===Post- independence=== The Indonesian national revolution (1945‚Äì1949) ended with the Netherlands' recognition of the Republic of Indonesia. The Indonesian declaration of independence from the Dutch in 1949 was announced in Gambir Palace. During the ceremony, the Dutch flag was substituted with the Flag of Indonesia. Many spectators were rejoicing when the flag was hoisted, and yelled \\"Merdeka! (Freedom!)\\". From that moment, Gambir Palace became known as Merdeka Palace. Tony Lovink, the High Commissioner of the Dutch Crown was the last man representing the Dutch power to leave the Palace. The name of the palace officially changed to Istana Merdeka (\\"Indendepence Palace\\") on 28 December 1949 at 17.55 hours. On 27 December 1949, a day after the ceremony, President Sukarno and his family arrived from Yogyakarta. For the first time, the President of the Republic of Indonesia settled in Merdeka Palace. The first annual Independence Day ceremony was held at the Merdeka Palace in 1950. ==Evolution of the Merdeka Palace== The building has remain unchanged since the building was finished in 1879. After the Indonesian independence, the Merdeka Palace compound was expanded to include not only Istana Negara (State Palace), but also to construct Wisma Negara, Sekretariat Negara (State Sectreatiat) and Bina Graha. Several colonial buildings and residences were demolished in the Weltevreden area to make way for today's State Palace compound. A small octagonal gazebo located in the courtyard of the palace was used as private school for Sukarno's and the palace staff's children. This gazebo was previously used by Dutch colonial officials as muziekkoepel (music gazebo), where music performances were played during formal balls.Yuk, Main ke Istana Presiden!, 30 August 2012, detik.com When Suharto became president of Indonesia, he made changes to the previously residential function of the Palace. Sukarno's bedroom was converted into Ruang Bendera Pusaka (Regalia Room) and the room of Sukarno's wife Fatmawati became the President's bedroom. An old wooden building in the palace complex known as \\"Sanggar\\" was demolished to make way for the Puri Bhakti Renatama building, and was used as a museum to store valuable artifacts, artwork and gifts from foreign emissaries. Later he also built the Bina Graha building on the palace grounds, which he used as his office. When Megawati took office, she had the Puri Bhakti Renatama building converted into the President's office, while its contents moved to Bina Graha building. She also restored the furniture and decorations of the palace back to the way it was under Sukarno. Suharto's Jepara wood carving furniture was removed, with the exception of the Ruang Jepara (Jepara Room, as a reminder of Suharto's regime), and replaced with the old colonial refurbishment. ==The Merdeka Palace now== Aerial view of the Palace compound Vladimir Putin meets Yudhoyono at the Merdeka Palace during the Russian state visit of 2007 The Merdeka Palace serves as an official venue for state events such as the Independence Day ceremony, welcoming (foreign) dignitaries, cabinet meetings, state banquets and reception of letters of credence from foreign ambassadors. Additionally, it still contains the president's private quarters and offices. The administrative role that the palace once had, has been shifted to the State Palace and State Secretariat, while the Merdeka Palace remains a symbol of authority. ===Layout of the Palace=== A 17 m tall flagpole and a fountain are located on the front lawn of the Merdeka Palace. The annual flag raising ceremony takes place during the Indonesian Independence day on 17 August. During the Independence ceremony, the veranda is often used as a ceremonial stage for the President and dignitaries. Notable rooms in the Palace include: * Ruang Kredensial (credential hall) provides entrance to the palace and is the place where most diplomatic activities are conducted, such as receiving state guests and ambassadors. The credential hall is decorated with furniture that dates back to the colonial days, as well as paintings and ceramic works. * Ruang Jepara (Jepara room) was a former study room of Sukarno, and named after the Central Javanese town of Jepara, source of the room's carved wooden furniture and ornaments. * Ruang Raden Saleh (Raden Saleh room) is located in front of Ruang Jepara. The room was previously used as the First Lady's office and living room. Megawati used the room to store 5 paintings by Indonesian painter Raden Saleh. * Ruang Resepsi (reception room) is the largest room of the palace. It is usually used for state banquets, state gala dinners, national meetings, and cultural performances. There are two paintings of Basuki Abdullah. On the eastern wall hangs \\"Pergiwa Pergiwati\\", a painting theme from Mahabharata, and on the west wall hangs the Javanese \\"Jaka Tarub\\" painting. * Ruang Bendera Pusaka (the heirloom flag room), or Regalia room. The room is used to store \\"Bendera Pusaka\\", the first Indonesian flag that was raised during Indonesian Declaration of Independence on 17 August 1945. The presidents after Sukarno no longer use the palace as a residence, although it is still the official presidential residence. The palace's offices are still in use by the current Indonesian president. During the Suharto administration, Suharto preferred to reside in his own house at Jalan Cendana, Menteng, while the palace and Bina Graha only served as his office. The palace once again became the official presidential residence during the Abdurrahman Wahid and Megawati administrations. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono sometimes resides in Merdeka Palace, however just like Suharto, he often prefers to reside in his own house, at Puri Cikeas, Cibubur, south of Jakarta. ==Changing of the guard== Since 17 July 2016, the changing of the guard ceremony by the Paspampres has been opened to the public.

Federal investigators reportedly suspected that Cartwright leaked details of the operation to a New York Times reporter.Ellen Nakashima & Adam Goldman, Leak investigation stalls amid fears of confirming U.S.-Israel operation, Washington Post (March 10, 2015). In March 2015, the Washington Post reported that the sensitive leak investigation, led by Rod J. Rosenstein, had \\"stalled amid concerns that a prosecution in federal court could force the government to confirm\\" information about the highly classified program. U.S. officials feared that if classified information were revealed in any information, it would harm U.S.-Israeli relations and would also complicate the then-pending negotiations on an agreement with Iran over the nuclear program. It was reported that federal prosecutors had discussions with the Office of White House Counsel, then led by Kathryn Ruemmler, on whether certain material important to the case would be declassified, and Ruemmler conveyed that the government was unwilling to provide the documentation. Cartwright denied any wrongdoing; his attorney, Gregory B. Craig, said in March 2015 that Cartwright had no contact with federal investigators for over a year. Craig stated: \\"General Cartwright has done nothing wrong. He has devoted his entire life to defending the United States. He would never do anything to weaken our national defense or undermine our national security. Hoss Cartwright is a national treasure, a genuine hero and a great patriot.\\" On November 2, 2012, in an interview with the FBI, Cartwright denied he was the source of the leaks. On October 17, 2016, Cartwright entered a guilty plea in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on a charge of making false statements during the leak investigation, a felony. Outgoing President Barack Obama pardoned Cartwright on January 17, 2017, two weeks prior to his scheduled sentencing hearing. ==Post-retirement work== Cartwright was the inaugural holder of the Harold Brown Chair in Defense Policy Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank - a post he held from 2011 until 2017.https://www.csis.org/programs/international-security- program/harold-brown-chair In addition, Cartwright serves as a member of board of directors of The Raytheon Company, a senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard Kennedy School, and as a defense consultant for ABC News.

He serves as an advisor to the board of directors for Accenture, Enlightenment Capital, IxReveal, Logos Technologies, Opera Solutions, and TASC Inc. He is also affiliated with a number of professional organizations, including the Aspen Strategy Group, The Atlantic Council, Nuclear Threat Initiative, and The Sanya Initiative. Cartwright is also a leading advocate for the phased and verified elimination of all nuclear weapons worldwide (\\"Global Zero (campaign)\\"). In October 2011, he spoke at the Global Zero Summit at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, and currently serves as Chair of the Global Zero U.S. Nuclear Policy Commission, which in May 2012 released its report, \\"Modernizing U.S. Nuclear Force Structure and Policy,\\" calling for the United States and Russia to reduce their nuclear arsenals 80% to 900 total weapons each, which would pave the way to bringing other nuclear weapons countries into the first-in-history multilateral nuclear arms negotiations. In June 2015, Cartwright was a signatory to a public letter written by a bipartisan group of 19 U.S. diplomats, experts, and others, on the then- pending negotiations for an agreement between Iran and world powers over Iran's nuclear program.William J. Broad, Iran Accord's Complexity Shows Impact of Bipartisan Letter, The New York Times (14 July 2015).Public Statement on U.S. Policy Toward the Iran Nuclear Negotiations Endorsed by a Bipartisan Group of American Diplomats, Legislators, Policymakers, and Experts, Washington Institute for Near East Policy (24 June 2015). That letter outlined concerns about several provisions in the then-unfinished agreement and called for a number of improvements to strengthen the prospective agreement and win the letter-writers' support for it. The final agreement, concluded in July 2015, shows the influence of the letter.

His actions on arriving in the United States led to a major political and international incident, which was termed the Citizen Gen√™t Affair. Because of his actions, President George Washington asked the French government to recall him. The Mountain, having risen to power at the same time, replaced Gen√™t and issued a warrant for his arrest. Fearing for his life, Gen√™t asked for asylum in America, which was granted by Washington. Gen√™t stayed in the United States until his death. Historian Carol Berkin argues that the Gen√™t affair bolstered popular respect for the president and strengthened his role in dealing with in foreign affairs.Carol Berkin, A Sovereign People: The Crises of the 1790s and the Birth of American Nationalism (2017) pp 81‚Äì150. ==Early life and education== Gen√™t was born in Versailles in 1763. He was the ninth and final child of a French civil servant, Edmond Jacques Gen√™t (1726‚Äì1781), who was a head clerk in the ministry of foreign affairs. The elder Gen√™t analyzed British naval strength during the Seven Years' War and monitored the progress of the American Revolutionary War. His eldest sister was Jeanne-Louise-Henriette Campan, who became an educator and author. Agla√©-Louise Augui√© (1782-1854), who was the wife of Marshal Ney of France, was Gen√™t's niece. Gen√™t was a prodigy who could read French, English, Italian, Latin, Swedish, Greek, and German by the age of 12. ==Career== At 18, Gen√™t was appointed court translator, and in 1788 he was sent to the French embassy in Saint Petersburg to serve as ambassador. Over time, Gen√™t became disenchanted with the ancien r√©gime, learning to despise not just the French monarchy but all monarchical systems, including Tsarist Russia under Catherine the Great. In 1792, Catherine declared Gen√™t persona non grata, calling his presence \\"not only superfluous but even intolerable.\\" The same year, the Girondins rose to power in France and appointed Gen√™t to the post of minister to the United States. ===Citizen Gen√™t Affair=== President's House, Philadelphia. Washington confronted Gen√™t in the presidential mansion in Philadelphia, then the national capital. The Citizen Gen√™t affair began in 1793 when he was dispatched to the United States to promote American support for France's wars with Spain and Britain. Gen√™t arrived in Charleston, South Carolina on the French frigate Embuscade on April 8. Instead of traveling to the then-capital of Philadelphia to present himself to U.S. President George Washington for accreditation, Gen√™t stayed in South Carolina. There he was greeted with enthusiasm by the people of Charleston, who threw a string of parties in his honor. Gen√™t's goals in South Carolina were to recruit and arm American privateers who would join French expeditions against the British. He commissioned four privateering ships in total, including the Republicaine, the Anti-George, the Sans-Culotte, and the Citizen Gen√™t. Working with French consul Michel Ange Bernard Mangourit, Gen√™t organized American volunteers to fight Britain's Spanish allies in Florida. After raising a militia, Gen√™t set sail toward Philadelphia, stopping along the way to marshal support for the French cause and arriving on May 16. He encouraged Democratic-Republican societies, but President Washington denounced them and they quickly withered away. He was also hosted by the Democratic- Republican Tammany Society in 1793. His actions endangered American neutrality in the war between France and Britain, which Washington had pointedly declared in his Neutrality Proclamation of April 22. When Gen√™t met with Washington, he asked for what amounted to a suspension of American neutrality to support the cause of France. When turned down by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and informed that his actions were unacceptable, Gen√™t protested. Meanwhile, Gen√™t's privateers were capturing British ships, and his militia was preparing to move against the Spanish. Gen√™t continued to defy the wishes of the United States government, capturing British ships and rearming them as privateers. Washington sent Gen√™t an 8,000-word letter of complaint on Jefferson's and Hamilton's advice ‚Äì one of the few situations in which the Federalist Alexander Hamilton and the Republican Jefferson agreed. Gen√™t replied obstinately. President Washington and his Cabinet then demanded that France recall Gen√™t as its Ambassador. The Mountain, having taken power in France by January 1794, issued an arrest warrant for Gen√™t. Gen√™t, knowing that he would likely be sent to the guillotine, asked Washington for asylum. Hamilton, Gen√™t's fiercest opponent in the cabinet, convinced Washington to grant him safe haven in the United States. ===Later life=== Portrait of Gen√™t by Ezra Ames, 1809-10 After obtaining asylum in the United States from Washington, Gen√™t moved to New York State. On June 26, 1808, Gen√™t wrote an article, \\"Madison as a 'French Citizen,'\\" for the New York Register in an attempt to promote the prospects of his father-in-law, the incumbent Vice President George Clinton, over James Madison in the presidential election of 1808. Noting the honorary French citizenship afforded Madison in 1792, Gen√™t reasoned that the Embargo Act of 1807 had been intended by Secretary of State Madison to aid Napoleon in the enforcement of the Berlin Decree, especially seeing that American trade with Britain was more important than that with France. Playing to a northeastern audience, Gen√™t continued that, judging by Jefferson's glorification of an agricultural lifestyle in Notes on the State of Virginia, the Embargo was also acting as a covert means to destroy New England's commercial heritage. As such, New Englanders would be forced to turn to agriculture, and Virginia's dominance of American politics would continue.Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Fred L. Israel, and William P.

Gen√™t lived on a farm he called Prospect Hill located in East Greenbush, New York overlooking the Hudson River. Living the life of a gentleman farmer, he wrote a book about inventions. Their children included: * Edmond Charles Genet (1797‚Äì1802), who died young. * Henry James Genet (1800‚Äì1872), a member of the State Assembly in 1832 who married Martha Elizabeth Taylor (1809‚Äì1896). * Maria Louisa Genet (1802‚Äì1888), who married Cornelius Van Buren Van Rensselaer (1793‚Äì1868), son of Col. Nicholas Van Rensselaer. * Charles Alexander Genet (1805‚Äì1838) * Cornelia Tappen Genet (1808‚Äì1877), who married Andrew Conkey Getty (1810‚Äì1891). His wife Cornelia died in 1810, and on July 31, 1814, Gen√™t remarried to Martha Brandon Osgood (1787‚Äì1853), the daughter of Samuel Osgood, the United States' first Postmaster General. Together, they were the parents of: * Henriette Campan Genet (1815‚Äì1826), who died young. * Edmond Charles Genet (b. 1816), who died young. * Samuel Osgood Genet (1819‚Äì1824), who died young. * Edme Jacques Genet (1821‚Äì1891), who married Magdelene Van Rensselaer Witbeck (1813‚Äì1900). They had no children. * George Clinton Genet (1824‚Äì1904), who married Augusta Georgia Kirtland (1838‚Äì1911). They had no children. He died on July 14, 1834 and is buried in the churchyard behind the Greenbush Reformed Church, about two miles east of his farm. ===Descendants=== Edmond Charles Clinton Genet on September 4, 1916. He was in the midst of his six-month training to become a fighter pilot Edmond Charles Clinton Genet (1896‚Äì1917), who served with the Lafayette Escadrille and was the first American flier to die in the First World War after the United States declared war against Germany in 1917, was Gen√™t's great-grandson. ==Legacy== The elementary school in East Greenbush, New York is named Citizen Genet Elementary School. ==See also== * Franco-U.S. relations ==References== ;Notes ;Sources ==Further reading== * Ammon, Harry.

The council was mostly made up of members of the Manitoba Legislative Assembly and members of the Parliament of Canada who were appointed to serve on the council. No members appointed were allowed to sit on the council until December 28, 1872. The council ran the territories under the Temporary Government of Rupert's Land Act and the Manitoba Act. The council's mandate was renewed every year by the federal government until it was dissolved in 1876, to make way for the 1st Council of the Northwest Territories. ==Early history== The territory formally known as Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory were sold to the Government of Canada by the Hudson's Bay Company on November 19, 1869. The two territories were amalgamated to form the Northwest Territories. The creation of a government for the territories was delayed by Louis Riel, who led the Red River Rebellion, ultimately leading to the creation of the province of Manitoba. The Northwest Territories joined confederation with Manitoba on July 5, 1870. Despite the provisions in law for setting up a council under the Temporary Government Act, 1870, the first council appointments by the Governor General of Canada would not take place until November 28, 1872. The first attempt at creating the council came with the appointment of Francis Godschall Johnson by Lieutenant Governor Adams George Archibald on October 21, 1870. Johnson lost his appointment after it was overturned by the federal government. The federal government ruled Archibald had exceeded his powers in creating the council. The first session of the Council began on March 8, 1873. The Council session was short sitting only two days. The Lieutenant Governor of the territory acted as Speaker, presiding over the Council. All acts of the Council had to be sent to Ottawa for approval by the Governor General. The Council had a poor relationship with the press of the day. Appointments to the Council after 1872 were generally made in secret without official notification in some places and major publications were forbidden from covering early council proceedings. The Council met for meetings while it was in session at Early Government House in Fort Garry. ==Council members== {  !rowspan=2Members by date !colspan=21870 !1872 !colspan=21873 !colspan=31874 !1876 - !Oct 21 !Unknown !Nov 28 !Unknown !Oct 30 !Unknown !Mar 26 !Jul 7 !Nov 7 - Andrew Bannatyne bgcolor=\\"grey\\" colspan=2 bgcolor=green colspan=7 - Alfred Boyd bgcolor=\\"grey\\" colspan=2 bgcolor=green colspan=7 - Walter Robert Bown bgcolor=\\"grey\\" colspan=4 bgcolor=green colspan=5 - Pascal Breland bgcolor=\\"grey\\" colspan=2 bgcolor=green colspan=7 - William J.

An attempt was made to set up the council and appoint the first member by Lieutenant Governor Archibald on October 21, 1870. The federal government told Archibald that he overstepped his bounds and the appointment of Johnson was revoked days later. After the council was officially set up there were two main sets of appointments made, both of them by Lieutenant Governor Alexander Morris. Lieutenant Governor Alexander Morris set up the council and appointed the members in 1872 and 1873. The first batch of appointments came on December 28, 1872. That date Morris would appoint a total of eleven members to the council. This was the single biggest number of appointments in the history of the Northwest Territories Legislative Assembly. Less than a full calendar year later and despite only being allowed up to fifteen seats, appointments to the council exceeded that limit during the second round in October 1873. All but two members of the Council held on to their seat until it was dissolved in 1876. William J. Christie resigned his seat in 1873 and Robert Cunningham was the only member of the council to die in office on July 4, 1874. In addition to the death of Cunningham, the first secretary of the North-West Council William T. Urquhart died at his home on September 24, 1874. ==Legislation== Over the course of three legislative sessions the Council adopted legislation that formed the basis of Northwest Territories law. The legislation covered a wide variety of issues. The measures related to law and justice included customs duties, prohibition on liquor along with the establishment of a police force, the establishment of the Stipendiary Magistrate system. The Council was equally responsive in establishing social policy. Welfare programs for native populations was established. This included negotiating the first treaties to bring in the reserve system. Legislation regulating how masters treat their servants was also implemented. In regards to infrastructure, the Council passed regulations securing public right of ways including roads and waterways. Legislation was also implemented to send out survey parties to various parts of the territory. Resource management was also practiced with the limitation of the buffalo hunt, and regulations on other hunts including banning poisons for use in hunting practices. ===Prohibition=== The most notable legislation the council produced came out of the second legislative session that began on March 11, 1874. The council banned the importation and manufacture of spirituous liquors and passed a motion to recommend the creation of the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP). The purpose behind the ban was to prevent settlers from trading alcohol to native populations, with the NWMP created to enforce the prohibition. The only liquor allowed in the territory was brought in with special permission by the lieutenant governor. The Cypress Hills massacre was the driving force for the council to implement prohibition and recommend a police force. ===Natives=== The Council implemented legislation to provide training programs and equipment to teach native people agricultural practices. This legislation included providing cattle and other livestock. Members of the council also proposed and negotiated the first treaties, creating the reserve system in Canada. The Council also set regulations in the final session to limit the Buffalo Hunt; this was a measure to address the sharp decline in the Buffalo population. This was also a further measure to encourage native populations to adopt agricultural practices using programs that had been previously implemented by the Government. ===Justice=== The Council also proposed the appointment of Stipendiary Magistrates to the North-West Council to deal with most legal cases in the territory. Each appointed Magistrate would take up residence in a certain area and be responsible for all legal cases. The Magistrates were given the option of referring cases of an unusual nature to the Court of Queen's Bench in Manitoba. This would become the prominent justice system of the territory until the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories was founded in 1887. This court system played a major role in the development and history of the 1st Council of the Northwest Territories. ==The final session== The last session of the Temporary North- West council was called on November 23, 1875. The throne speech outlined the need for regulation of the Buffalo Hunt, peaceful and orderly settlement to the territory and highlighted past legislative achievements of the council. The last council session closed on December 14, 1875 and did not meet again until it was dissolved on November 7, 1876. == References  *Canadian Parliamentary Companion 1873 edition page 490 Category:Northwest Territories Legislative Assemblies ","title":"Temporary North-West Council"},{"id":"2230537","text":"Bligh was an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of New South Wales.

It was a highly diverse electorate, as it contained both some of the wealthiest suburbs of Sydney, along the edge of the harbour, as well as some of the city's most disadvantaged areas, such as those around Redfern. This had the effect of making Bligh a marginal seat, although as the wealthier suburbs outnumbered the poorer suburbs, it tended to be -leaning. Independent Clover Moore defeated the incumbent Liberal member Michael Yabsley in 1988 (Yabsley subsequently reentered Parliament in the Vaucluse by-election later that year) and held the seat until its abolition in 2007, when it was replaced by the electoral district of Sydney. ==Members for Bligh== {  - ! colspan=\\"2\\"Member !

The palace is noted for its distinctive architectural and historical features, as well as the adjoining botanical gardens. Istana Bogor was opened to the public in 1968 to public tour groups (not individuals), with the permission of the acting President of Indonesia, Suharto. The gardens of the palace covers an area of 284,000 square metres (28.4 hectares). During the colonial era the palace became favorite residence of the Governors-General due to Bogor's more adaptable climate. It was also favored by the late President Sukarno and became the official presidential residence until his downfall in 1967. The palace remained mostly unused until February 2015, when the new president Joko Widodo moved the president's office from Merdeka Palace to Bogor Palace. ==History== Lithograph of the palace in 1889. Interior of the palace in 1921, depicting the main hall of the palace. Interior of the palace in 1921. The original colonial building on the site of Istana Bogor was a mansion named Buitenzorg, meaning: Without a care in Dutch (also Sans Souci, meaning: Without a care in French), which dates back to 1745 as a country retreat for the Dutch Governors to escape the heat and diseases of Batavia. The location for the new palace was discovered by Baron van Imhoff on 10 August 1744, in a village named \\"Kampong Baroe\\". On the site he ordered a mansion to be built, however the construction wasn't completed by the end of his career in 1750 and thus it was continued by his preceder Jacob Mossel.Sejarah Berdirinya Istana Bogor , bogorsehat.comISTANA-ISTANA KEPRESIDENAN REPUBLIK INDONESIA, setneg.go.id An extensive renovation of the palace occurred under Governor-General Herman Willem Daendels (1808 ‚Äì 1811). The palace was further expanded into two floors, with a new wing added in the east and west of the original structure. In 1811 Stamford Raffles led a successful Invasion to Java and Britain took possession of the colony until 1816. Raffles had Buitenzorg Palace as his residence due to the temperate climate of the hills of Bogor, while conducting most of the council meeting in the palace of Rijswijk in Batavia. During his stay he had the garden of the Buitenzorg palace transformed into an English garden, which became an inspiration for the later botanical garden. Later the new governor general Baron van der Capellen (1817-1826) added a small dome on the roof of the main building and founded the botanical garden next to the palace ground. However, in 1834, an earthquake triggered by the volcanic eruption of Mount Salak, heavily damaged the old palace of Buitenzorg. The ruined palace was then demolished and rebuilt into its present form in 1856-- this time with only one storey instead of the original two, as a precaution against further earthquakes. From 1870 to 1942 the Istana Bogor served as the official residence of the Dutch Governor General, however state affairs are still largely conducted in Batavia. Since its foundation, a total of 44 Governor- General of the Dutch East Indies had resided in the palace. After the Indonesian independence, several feature of the palace was renovated in 1952. Major changes include an additional porch at the main entrance and connecting corridors for the main buildings to its wings. The palace became the main residence of President Sukarno, but was later neglected by Suharto when he came to office. ==Feature== View from the side of the main entrance The grounds of the estate contain several buildings, the largest are the Gedung Induk (main palace) and its two wings. The main palace building contains private offices for the head of state, library, dining room, theater room, the ministers' waiting room, the Teratai room (the living room) and the Garuda room (the main reception hall). The 2 wing buildings located east and west of the main building. The eastern wing are used for foreign head of state's guesthouse, during the colonial period this wing was used for the governor general's personal guest. While the western wing have 2 main rooms, one are used as guesthouse for ministers who accompany the main guest during a state visit, and the other as a conference room. During the colonial period this wing are used by the staffs of the governor general. The palace is decorated with an extensive art collection (448 paintings, 216 sculptures and 196 ceramics), 90% of which were accumulated by Sukarno. The original historic collection of the palace was looted by Japanese and Allied force during WW2, leaving nothing but 5 mirrors in the palace. Other buildings in the palace include 6 pavilions: Paviliun Dyah Bayurini, Paviliun Jodipati, Paviliun Amarta, Paviliun Madukara, Paviliun Pringgondani, and Paviliun Dwarawati. Paviliun Dyah Bayurini was built in 1964 and is used by the head of state and his/her family's during a stay in Bogor, the Pavilion also include a swimming pool. Other buildings are used as guesthouses for government ministers and officials. There is also a multi-purpose building which was built in 1908. ===Gardens=== The garden covers an area of 28.4 hectare and are adjacent to Kebun Raya Bogor (Bogor Botanical Garden). A herd of spotted deer can be spotted roaming around the palace garden, they are native to India and Nepal. The deers were originally brought by the Governor General Daendels for hunting and sport. There are many sculptures of various origin decorating the palace garden, some of them are noteworthy: *Dhyani Boddisatta, from 9th century Central Java. *a replica of Hand of God by Carl Milles, a gift from Swedish government. *a replica of The Little Mermaid. *a replica of The Archer, made by Zsigmond Kisfaludi Strobl in 1914. == Hotel Salak The Heritage == In 1856, along with the rebuilding of the Bogor Palace, the Dutch government built a hotel to serve as a guest house in the Bogor Palace. The hotel was first named the Dibbets Hotel for the founder, J. Dibbets. The hotel was also once known as the Binnenhof Hotel or Bellevue Hotel. During the Japanese occupation (1942-1945), the hotel was used as the Kempetai Headquarters (Japanese Military Police). After Indonesia's independence, the hotel was handed over to the Indonesian government and was renamed the Hotel Salak The Heritage after the name of Mount Salak, the largest mountain in Bogor. The word \\"The Heritage\\" was used to express to the public that this hotel is indeed one of the heritages of the city of Bogor. Hotel Salak The Heritage is currently managed professionally, with 120 rooms, 12 meeting rooms, 3 restaurants, the Kinanty Music Caf√©, a swimming pool, and other facilities. Hotel Salak The Heritage is still preserved by the government as one of the historical witnesses supporting the existence of the Bogor Palace in particular and the long history of the city of Bogor. == See also== * Cipanas Palace * Gedung Agung * State Palace (Indonesia) * Vice Presidential Palace (Indonesia) ==References Category:Presidential palaces in Indonesia Category:Buildings and structures in West Java Category:Cultural Properties of Indonesia in West Java Category:Bogor Category:Rebuilt buildings and structures ","title":"Bogor Palace"},{"id":"2230553","text":"North Equatorial Current (in black) The North Equatorial Current is a significant Pacific and Atlantic Ocean current that flows east-to-west between about 10¬∞ north and 20¬∞ north.

Diadectes was one of the first herbivorous tetrapods, and also one of the first fully terrestrial animals to attain large size. ==Description== Restoration Close-up of the skull of Diadectes sideropelicus (AMNH 4684) showing broad teeth Diadectes was a heavily built animal, long, with a thick- boned skull, heavy vertebrae and ribs, massive limb girdles, and short, robust limbs. The nature of the limbs and vertebrae clearly indicates a terrestrial animal. The rib cage was assumed to be barrel-shaped, but new fossils show the ribs were actually sticking out to the sides.Dig into new bones in Seymour - Newschannel 6 Now  Wichita Falls, TX ==Paleobiology== Fossil It possesses some characteristics of reptilians and amphibians, combining a reptile-like skeleton with a more primitive, seymouriamorph-like skull. Diadectes has been classified as belonging to the sister group of the amniotes. Skull of Diadectes tenuitectes at the Harvard Museum of Natural History Among its primitive features, Diadectes has a large otic notch (a feature found in all labyrinthodonts, but not in reptiles) with an ossified tympanum. At the same time, its teeth show advanced specialisations for an herbivorous diet that are not found in any other type of early Permian animal. The eight front teeth are spatulate and peg-like, and served as incisors that were used to nip off mouthfuls of vegetation. The broad, blunt cheek teeth show extensive wear associated with occlusion, and would have functioned as molars, grinding up the food. It also had a partial secondary palate, which meant it could chew its food and breathe at the same time, something many even more advanced reptiles were unable to do. These traits are likely adaptations related to the animals' high-fiber, herbivorous diet, and evolved independently of similar traits seen in some reptilian groups. Many of the reptile-like details of the postcranial skeleton are possibly related to carrying the substantial trunk; these may be independently derived traits on Diadectes and their relatives. Though very similar, they would be analogous rather than homologous to those of early amniotes such as pelycosaurs and pareiasaurs, as the first reptiles evolved from small, swamp-dwelling animals like Casineria and Westlothiana.Carroll R.L.

Ashlock (1991): Principles of systematic zoology. New York: McGraw-Hill ==Discovery== Diadectes was first named and described by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1878, based on part of a lower jaw (AMNH 4360) from the Permian of Texas. Cope noted: \\"Teeth with short and much compressed crowns, whose long axis is transverse to that of the jaws,\\" the feature expressed in the generic name Diadectes \\"crosswise biter\\" (from Greek dia \\"crosswise\\" + Greek dƒìktƒìs \\"biter\\"). He described the animal as \\"in all probability, herbivorous.\\" Cope's neo-Latin type species name sideropelicus (from Greek sidƒìros \\"iron\\" + Greek pƒìlos \\"clay\\" + -ikos) \\"of iron clay\\" alluded to the Wichita beds in Texas, where the fossil was found. Diadectes fossil remains are known from a number of locations across North America, especially the Texas Red Beds (Wichita and Clear Fork). ==Classification and species== Numerous species have been assigned to Diadectes, though most of those have proven to be synonyms of one another. Similarly, many supposed separate genera of diadectids have been shown to be junior synonyms of Diadectes. One of these, Nothodon, was actually published by Othniel Charles Marsh five days before the name Diadectes was published by his rival Cope. Despite this fact, in 1912, Case synonymized the two names and treated Diadectes as the senior synonym, which has been followed by other paleontologists since, despite the fact that it violates the rules of International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN).Kissel, R. (2010). \\"Morphology, Phylogeny, and Evolution of Diadectidae (Cotylosauria: Diadectomorpha).\\" Thesis (Graduate Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology University of Toronto). ==Phylogeny== A phylogenetic analysis of Diadectes and related diadectids was presented in an unpublished PhD thesis by Richard Kissel in 2010. Previous phylogenetic analyses of diadectids had found D. absitus to be more basal than other species of Diadectes, outside the derived clade composed of these species. In these analyses, Diasparactus zenos was more closely related to the other species of Diadectes than was D. absitus, making Diadectes paraphyletic. Kissel recovered this paraphyly in his analysis and proposed the new genus name \\"Silvadectes\\" for D. absitus. Below is the cladogram from Kissel's thesis: However, according to the ICZN, a name presented in an initially unpublished thesis such as Kissel's is not valid. Because the name \\"Silvadectes\\" has not yet been formally erected in a published paper, it was not, as of 2010, considered valid. == References == * Parker, Steve.

Under White's leadership, the UFC has grown into a globally popular multibillion-dollar enterprise. As of August 2019, White's net worth was assessed at $500 million. ==Early life and education== Dana White Jr. was born in Manchester, Connecticut on July 28, 1969, the son of June and Dana White. He and his sister, Kelly, were raised by their mother and her family for the majority of their childhoods. White has said he is an Irish American. He began boxing at age 17 and graduated from Hermon High School in Maine in 1987. He started college twice, once at Quincy College and once at UMass Boston, but dropped out during his first semester each time. White then worked as a boxercise coach. White spent many of his early years residing in Ware, Massachusetts. He claims he left Boston for Las Vegas after reportedly being threatened by mobster Whitey Bulger and his associate Kevin Weeks. \\"He basically said, 'You owe us money'. It was like $2,500, which was like $25,000 to me back then, and said, 'You owe us money.' It was actually a guy named Kevin Weeks, who if you saw the trial he's Whitey's right-hand man. I'm sure he's very prominent in the movie, but yeah basically said I owed him some money, and I didn't pay him. This went on for a while and one day I was at my place and I got a call and they said, 'You owe us the money tomorrow by 1 o'clock'. I literally hung up the phone, picked up the phone and called Delta and bought a ticket to Vegas.\\" ==CareerUltimate Fighting Championship=== While working as a manager for Tito Ortiz and Chuck Liddell, White met Bob Meyrowitz, the owner of Semaphore Entertainment Group, the parent company of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. When White learned that Meyerwitz was looking to sell the UFC, he contacted childhood friend Lorenzo Fertitta, an executive and co-founder of Station Casinos, and former commissioner of the Nevada State Athletic Commission, to ask if he would be interested in acquiring the company. In January 2001, Lorenzo and his older brother Frank acquired the UFC for $2 million, which subsequently became a subsidiary of Zuffa. White was installed as the company's president. White said that when he and the Fertittas acquired the UFC, all they received was the brand name \\"UFC\\" and an old octagon. The previous owners had stripped the company's assets to avoid bankruptcy, so much so that the UFC.com website had been sold to a company named \\"User Friendly Computers\\". Over time, with White as president, the UFC developed into a highly successful business, and its gross revenue was $600 million in 2015. In July 2016, Zuffa was sold to a consortium of investors led by WME-IMG for $4.025 billion. White owned 9% of the company at the time of the sale. White announced he would continue in his role as president, and was given a stake in the new business. In May 2017, the UFC announced White would host Dana White's Contender Series. Available exclusively through UFC Fight Pass, the promotion‚Äôs digital streaming service, and licensed separately from the UFC brand, the show allows up and coming fighters the chance to showcase their talents in hopes that one day they may compete in the UFC. On March 18, 2019, White revealed that he had signed a new, seven-year contract to remain president of the UFC, as the UFC signed a deal with ESPN. ===Boxing=== White entered the boxing scene by co-promoting Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Conor McGregor due to McGregor being contracted to the UFC. In October 2017, White said at Freddie Roach's Wild Card West boxing club that he was \\"getting into boxing, 100 percent.\\" White says that he wants to incorporate boxing into the company portfolio of the UFC. ==Filmography== * Ridiculousness, as himself, in episode: \\"Dana White\\" (2013) * The League, as The Goon, in episode: \\"Rafi and Dirty Randy\\" (2013) * Silicon Valley, as Dana White, in episode \\"Homicide\\" (2015) * It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, as Dana White, in episode \\"Wolf Cola: A Public Relations Nightmare\\" (2017) ==Personal life== White met his wife Anne (n√©e Stella) when they were in the eighth grade and they married in 1996. They have two sons, Dana III and Aidan, and one daughter, Savannah. White values his privacy, and keeps Anne out of the public spotlight. White bought a mansion in Pine Island Court, Las Vegas in 2006 from Frank Fertitta III for $1.95 million. White bought three other mansions in the same area from October 2016 to June 2017 for a combined total of around $6.2 million. Demolition permits were issued for the houses, presumably with the intent of creating a mega-mansion for White and his family. White was raised as a Catholic, but now considers himself to be an atheist. In 2011, White's mother, June, released the book Dana White, King of MMA: An Unauthorized Biography. June claimed in the book that, since his success with the UFC, Dana had \\"turned his back on his family and friends who were there for him when he needed help and support\\". In a season 15 episode of History Channel's Pawn Stars (originally airing on February 5, 2018), White purchased over $60,000 worth of Katana swords including one of Rick Harrison's 16th-century Japanese Katana. === Politics === White spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, where he endorsed Republican nominee Donald Trump. White said that Trump helped the UFC at its beginnings, allowing the UFC to host its first event under Zuffa ownership (UFC 30) at the Trump Taj Mahal when others venues refused to host the UFC. White said, \\"No arenas wanted us. This guy reached out, and he's always been a friend to me.\\" White reiterated his support for Trump for the 2020 election and spoke at the podium at one of Trump's reelection rallies in Colorado. In February 2020, White donated $1 million to America First Action, a super political action committee that supports Trump's re-election. In April 2020, Dana White joined a select group of industry leaders to help the United States rebuild its economy hit by the coronavirus pandemic. === Sex-tape lawsuit === White was accused in a sex- tape scandal, when a stripper allegedly taped a sexual encounter with White in Brazil around the year 2014 without his consent. The stripper also alleged White had been seeing her for months during his marriage.The stripper's live- in boyfriend then tried to extort money from White, which resulted in a criminal case against her boyfriend. In Nevada, on April 3, 2020, a civil suit against White was filed, claiming he offered the boyfriend money to persuade him to plead guilty, in which White has denied. According to the complaint, White paid $10,000 to the stripper to dance and have sex with him. ===Health issues=== In May 2012, White revealed that he had been diagnosed with M√©ni√®re's disease, a neurological disorder. He said, \\"It's like vertigo but on steroids.\\" White claims that the disease was brought on because of a large fight he was involved in during his youth. The UFC on Fuel TV 3: Korean Zombie vs. Poirier event was to be the first he had missed in 11 years with White staying home, adhering to medical advice. White is undergoing Orthokine treatment for M√©ni√®re's disease, which he says has greatly reduced his symptoms. ===Charity=== In 2010, White donated $50,000 for a liver transplant to Tuptim Jadnooleum, the daughter of ‚ÄúKru Nai‚Äù Rattanachai, one of the instructors for Tiger Muay Thai and MMA in Phuket, Thailand. In 2011, White donated $100,000 to his former high school to fund renovations to their athletic facilities. In 2017, White donated $1 million to the victims of the Las Vegas shooting. In 2019, after UFC 242, Khabib Nurmagomedov raised $100,000 for Dustin Poirier‚Äôs charity, The Good Fight Foundation, White followed and also donated $100,000 to Poirier‚Äôs charity foundation. ==Accomplishments== * Nevada Sportsman of the Year (2009) * Wrestling Observer Newsletter Awards ** Promoter of the Year (2005‚Äì13; 2015‚Äì16) * World MMA Awards ** Leading Man of the Year (2008-19) * Armed Forces Foundation ** Patriot Award ==ReferencesCategory:1969 births Category:Living people Category:American atheists Category:American chief executives Category:American people of Irish descent Category:Mixed martial arts executives Category:Businesspeople from Las Vegas Category:People from Manchester, Connecticut Category:Ultimate Fighting Championship ","title":"Dana White"},{"id":"2230603","text":"Irving Trust was an American investment bank headquartered in New York City that operated between 1851 and 1988 when it was acquired by Bank of New York. From 1965 the bank was the principal subsidiary of the Irving Bank Corporation. Between 1913 and 1931, its headquarters was in the Woolworth Building; after 1931, until it was acquired by Bank of New York, its headquarters was located at One Wall Street, at what is now known as the BNY Mellon Building. ==History== The bank had its origins in 1851, when the Irving Bank of the City of New York was founded. Since there was not yet a federal currency, each bank issued its own paper and those institutions with the most appealing names found their certificates more widely accepted. The firm was named after Washington Irving, an author, diplomat, and lawyer who had gained an international reputation as America's first man of letters. His portrait appeared on the bank's notes and contributed to their wide appeal. In June 1865, it converted from a state bank to a bank chartered under the National Bank Act of 1863, and became the Irving National Bank of New York. In 1907, after a merger, it became the Irving National Exchange Bank of New York, changing its name to the Irving National Bank in 1912. In 1922, it merged with the Columbia Trust Company, a New York State-chartered bank, creating the Irving Bank and Trust Company. Later, in 1926, it acquired by merger the American Exchange-Pacific Bank, and changed its name to the American Exchange Irving Trust Company. Finally, in 1929, it changed its name to the Irving Trust Company, the name under which it was known until 1989. As of March 9, 1921, there were four national banks in New York City operating branch offices, also including Catham and Phenix National, the Mechanics and Metals National, the Irving National, and National City Bank. In 1929, Irving was New York's fourth ranked financial institution, and fifth in the United States. Irving Trust was an official sponsor of the 1980 Winter Olympic Games in Lake Placid, New York. In 1983, the Irving Trust had 13 branches in New York and was primarily a wholesale bank working with mid- and large-sized corporations and banks. It also had offices around the world, allowing for their claim that the sun never set on the Irving. ===Merged into Bank of New York=== On October 7, 1988, the Irving Trust board signed an agreement to merge with Bank of New York ending a yearlong battle as Bank of New York engineered a hostile takeover. At the time of the merger the combined banks became the United States' 12th largest bank with asset of $42 billion. During that year Irving had been trying to participate in a friendly merger with Banca Commerciale Italiana. ==See also== *Irving Trust Company Building ==References== Category:Banks based in New York City Category:BNY Mellon Category:Defunct financial services companies of the United States Category:American companies established in 1851 Category:Banks established in 1851 Category:Banks disestablished in 1988 Category:Defunct banks of the United States Category:1851 establishments in New York (state) Category:1988 disestablishments in New York (state) Category:Defunct companies based in New York City ","title":"Irving Trust"},{"id":"2230606","text":"Equatorial Counter Current (in black) The Equatorial Counter Current is an eastward flowing, wind-driven current which extends to depths of 100-150m in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. More often called the North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC), this current flows west-to-east at about 3-10¬∞N in the Atlantic, Indian Ocean and Pacific basins, between the North Equatorial Current (NEC) and the South Equatorial Current (SEC). The NECC is not to be confused with the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) that flows eastward along the equator at depths around 200m in the western Pacific rising to 100m in the eastern Pacific. In the Indian Ocean, circulation is dominated by the impact of the reversing Asian monsoon winds. As such, the current tends to reverse hemispheres seasonally in that basin. The NECC has a pronounced seasonal cycle in the Atlantic and Pacific, reaching maximum strength in late boreal summer and fall and minimum strength in late boreal winter and spring. Furthermore, the NECC in the Atlantic disappears in late winter and early spring.Carton and Katz, 1990 The NECC is an interesting case because while it results from wind-driven circulation, it transports water against the mean westward wind stress in the tropics. This apparent paradox is concisely explained by Sverdrup theory, which shows that the east-west transport is governed by the north-south change in the curl of the wind stress.Yu et al., 2000 The Pacific NECC is also known to be stronger during warm episodes of the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Klaus Wyrtki, who first reported this connection, suggested that a stronger than normal NECC could be the cause of an El Ni√±o because of the extra volume of warm water it carried eastwards. There is also a South Equatorial Countercurrent (SECC) that transports water from west to east in the Pacific and Atlantic basins between 2¬∞S and 5¬∞S in the western basin and farther south toward the east.Reid, Jun., 1959Stramma, 1991 While the SECC is geostrophic in nature, the physical mechanism for its appearance is less clear than with the NECC; that is, Sverdrup theory does not obviously explain its existence. Additionally, the seasonal cycle of the SECC is not as defined as that of the NECC. == Theoretical Background == The NECC is a direct response to the meridional changes in the coriolis parameter and the wind stress curl near the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). In part the NECC owes its existence to the fact that the ITCZ is not located at the equator, rather several degrees of latitude to the north. The rapid relative change in the coriolis parameter (a function of latitude) near the equator combined with the ITCZ being located north of the equator leads to similar rapid changes in the surface Ekman transport of the ocean and areas of convergence and divergence in the oceanic mixed layer. Using the larger Pacific basin as an example, the resulting dynamic height pattern consists of a trough at the equator, and ridge near 5¬∞ degrees north, a trough at 10¬∞N, and finally a ridge closer to 20¬∞N. From geostrophy (the perfect balance between the mass field and velocity field), the NECC is located between the ridge and trough at 5¬∞N and 10¬∞N, respectively. Sverdrup theory succinctly summarizes this phenomenon mathematically by defining a geostrophic mass transport per unit latitude, M, as the east-west integral of the meridional derivative of wind stress curl, minus any Ekman transport. The Ekman transport into the current is typically negligible, at least in the Pacific NECC. The total NECC is found by simply integrating M over the relevant latitudes.Yu et al., 2000 == Atlantic North Equatorial Countercurrent == The Atlantic NECC consists of the eastward zonal transport of water between 3¬∞N and 9¬∞N, with typical widths on the order of 300 km. The Atlantic NECC is unique among the equatorial currents in that basin because of its extreme seasonality. The maximum eastward flow is attained in late boreal summer and fall while the countercurrent is replaced by westward flow in late winter and spring. The NECC has maximum transport of approximately 40 Sv (10^6 m3/s) at 38¬∞W. Transport reaches 30 Sv two months per year at 44¬∞W, while farther east at 38¬∞W the transport reaches that level five months per year. The magnitude of the NECC weakens substantially east of 38¬∞W due to water being absorbed by the westward equatorial current south of 3¬∞N.Carton and Katz, 1990 While the variability of the Atlantic NECC is dominated by the annual cycle (weak late winter, strong late summer), there is also interannual variability as well. The strength of the Atlantic NECC is notably stronger in years following El Ni√±o in the tropical Pacific, with 1983 and 1987 being notable examples.Katz, 1992 Physically, this implies that the altered convection in the Pacific Ocean due to El Ni√±o drives changes in the meridional gradient of wind stress curl over the equatorial Atlantic. == Pacific North Equatorial Countercurrent == The Pacific NECC is a major eastward moving surface current that transports more than 20 Sv from the West Pacific warm pool to the cooler east Pacific. In the western Pacific the countercurrent is centred near 5¬∞N while in the central Pacific it is located near 7¬∞N.Yu et al., 2000 At the surface, the current is located on the southern slope of the North Equatorial Trough, a region of low sea level which extends from east to west across the Pacific. The low sea level is a result of Ekman suction caused by the increased easterly winds found just to the north of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). In the western basin, the NECC may merge with the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) below the surface. Generally, the current weakens to the east in the basin, with estimated flows of 21 Sv, 14.2 Sv, and 12 Sv in the western, central, and eastern Pacific, respectively.Yu et al., 2000 Like the Atlantic NECC, the Pacific NECC undergoes an annual cycle. This is a result of the annual Rossby wave. Early each year increased winds in the eastern Pacific generate a region of lower sea level. Over the following months this propagates westward as an oceanic Rossby wave. Its fastest component, near 6¬∞N, reaches the western Pacific around mid-summer. At higher latitudes the wave travels more slowly. As a result in the western Pacific the NECC tends to be weaker than normal in the boral winter and spring, and stronger than normal in the summer and autumn. == Fluctuations of the Pacific NECC with El Ni√±o == The Pacific NECC is known to be stronger during classic El Ni√±o events, when there is an anomalous warming of the eastern and central Pacific that peaks in the boreal winter. Klaus Wyrtki was the first to report the connection, in the early 1970s, based on analysis of tide-gauge measurements at Pacific island stations on either side of the current. On the basis of this analysis, Wyrtki hypothesized that such an unusually strong NECC in the western Pacific would lead to an anomalous accumulation of warm water of the coast of Central America and thus an El Ni√±o. == See also == * Coral bleaching * Ocean current * Oceanic gyres * Physical oceanography * Walker circulation * Humboldt Current == Notes  References == *Carton, J. and E.

They were the first herbivorous tetrapods, and also the first fully terrestrial animals to attain large sizes. Footprints indicate that diadectids walked with an erect posture. They were the first to exploit plant material in terrestrial food chains, making their appearance an important stage in both vertebrate evolution and the development of terrestrial ecosystems. The best known and largest representative of the family is Diadectes, a heavily built animal that attained a maximum length of several metres. Several other genera and various fragmentary fossil remains are also known. Although well known genera like Diadectes first appear in the Late Pennsylvanian, fragmentary remains of possible diadectids are known from much earlier deposits, including a piece of lower jaw found in Mississippian strata from Tennessee. ==Description== Life restoration of Diadectes, a well- known Early Permian diadectid Diadectids have large bodies with relatively short limbs. The rib cage is barrel-shaped to accommodate a large digestive tract necessary for the digestion of cellulose in plants. The skulls of diadectids are wide and deep with blunt snouts. The internal nares (holes for the nostrils) are also short. Paleontologist E.C. Case compared diadectids to turtles in 1907, noting their large pectoral girdles, short, strong limbs, and robust skulls. Case described them as \\"lowly, sluggish, inoffensive herbivorous reptiles, clad in an armor of plate to protect them from the fiercely carnivorous pelycosaurs.\\" Diadectids have a heterodont dentition, meaning that their teeth vary in shape along the length of the jaws. The teeth are wide and bear many cusps or projections, an indication that diadectids ate tough plants. Some teeth are leaf-shaped and laterally compressed, another indication that diadectids were able to shred plant material. The procumbent front teeth of the lower jaw project forward. Diadectids likely had strong jaw muscles for processing plant material; the placement of the jaw joints above or below the level of the occlusal plane (the plane at which the teeth come together) would have given diadectid jaws mechanical advantage. The joints themselves give the jaws a complex range of movement suitable for consuming plants. Large holes and cavities in the skull called adductor chambers and temporal openings would have provided room for large jaw-closing muscles. A ridge on the dentary bone of the lower jaw may have provided a surface for chewing or even supported a beak. ==History of study== The first diadectid to be described was Diadectes. American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope named the genus in 1878 on the basis of several vertebrae and teeth from the Early Permian of Texas. Cope erected the family Diadectidae in 1880 to include Diadectes and Empedocles, a genus he named two years earlier. Nothodon, named by Cope's rival Othniel Charles Marsh in 1878, was soon placed in the family. Cope named several other diadectids, including Helodectes in 1880, Chilonyx and Empedias in 1883, and Bolbodon in 1896. Paleontologist E.C. Case named four other diadectids: Desmatodon in 1908, Diasparactus in 1910, Diadectoides in 1911, and Animasaurus along with paleontologist Samuel Wendell Williston in 1912. Case and Williston considered Marsh's Nothodon and Cope's Bolbodon to be synonymous with Diadectes. Marsh named Nothodon in the American Journal of Science only five days before Cope described Diadectes in Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society. Under rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, the name Nothodon would have priority over Diadectes, but because the name Diadectes has been in use since Case and Williston first synonymized the genera, Diadectes remains the accepted name. In North America, diadectids are known from Texas, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Prince Edward Island. A possible diadectid has also been found from Tennessee. It is known from a broken lower jaw and several teeth found in Mississippian-age (Chesterian) strata that are likely part of the Bangor Formation. In a detailed review of Diadectidae, paleontologist E.C. Olson placed three North American genera within the family: Diadectes, Diasparactus, and Desmatodon. Chilonyx, Empedias, Diadectoides, and Animasaurus were synonymized with Diadectes, and four species of Diadectes (D. sideropelicus, D. tenuitectes, D. lentus, and D. carinatus) were recognized. A fourth genus, Ambedus, was named in 2004 from the Early Permian of Ohio. Orobates, a diadectid from Germany Diadectids are also known from Germany. Phanerosaurus was described from several vertebrae near Zwickau by German paleontologist Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer in 1860, but was not recognized as a diadectid until 1925. A second species of Phanerosaurus was identified from some vertebrae and a fragmentary skull in 1882, and was given its own genus, Stephanospondylus, in 1905. In 1998, a new species of Diadectes, D. absitus, was described from the Bromacker sandstone quarry of the Tambach Formation in the Thuringian Forest of central Germany. A new genus of diadectid called Orobates was also named from the Bromacker Quarry in 2004. In 2015, the known geographic range of diadectids was expanded with the description of a new genus and species of diadectid from China, Alveusdectes fenestralis. Alveusdectes is also the youngest known diadectid by 16 million years, coming from a unit of the Late Permian Shangshihezi Formation that dates to about 256 million years. ==Classification== Diadectids have long been considered close relatives of the amniotes, tetrapods that lay eggs on land or retain the fertilized egg within the mother. In 1987, the paleontologist D.M.S. Watson placed the family in the larger group Diadectomorpha, which includes another family of large-bodied diadectomorphs, the Limnoscelidae, as well as the monotypic diadectomorph family Tseajaiidae, represented by the genus Tseajaia. Throughout the twentieth century, amniotes and diadectomorphs were often grouped together using the old name Cotylosauria, a name originally used for the most basal grade of what was then thought to be reptiles. In the early part of the century, many paleontologists regarded diadectids, along with other cotylosaurs (such as placodonts), to be close relatives of turtles. In most recent studies of early tetrapod phylogeny, Cotylosauria is no longer recognized and Diadectomorpha is placed as the sister taxon of Amniota. However, while the majority of analyses now place diadectids outside Amniota, some have found them to be true amniotes. Most phylogenetic studies of the three diadectomorph families ‚Äì Diadectidae, Limnoscelidae, and Tseajaiidae ‚Äì have found diadectids and limnoscelids to be more closely related to each other than either is to Tseajaia. In other words, Diadectidae and Limnoscelidae form a clade within Diadectomorpha and Tseajaia is excluded from the clade. In a 2010 phylogenetic analysis, Diadectidae formed a clade that was characterized by wide cheek teeth with cusps on either side. Unlike previous studies, it was found to be more closely related to Tseajaiidae than Limnoscelidae. The family was defined as Diadectes and all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with Diadectes than with Tseajaia. Below is a cladogram modified from the 2010 analysis: Diadectes is the best known diadectid, with six species named since its initial description. In a 2005 phylogenetic analysis, most species of Diadectes formed a clade with Diasparactus zenos. Two species, Diadectes absitus and Diadectes sanmiguelensis, were placed in more basal positions. These species possess primitive characteristics found in non-diadectid forms, such as Limnoscelis and Tseajaia. Because D. absitus and D. sanmiguelensis were placed far from other species of Diadectes in the analysis, their assignment to the genus was questioned. The same results were found in the 2010 analysis. Two new genera were erected in the study to include D. abstus and D. sanmiguelensis. D. sanmiguelensis, the more basal of the two forms, was placed in the new genus Oradectes. D. abstus was renamed Silvadectes. ==Evolutionary history== Diadectids were some of the first tetrapods, or four-legged vertebrates, to attain large sizes. Diadectids first appear in the Late Carboniferous with the genus Desmatodon, although recently described bones from Tennessee suggest that they may have appeared even earlier in the Early Carboniferous. They underwent a small evolutionary radiation in the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian, diversifying into thirteen species and outnumbering other diadectomorphs, such as the limnoscelids. This radiation was likely the result of diadectids' expansion into a new herbivorous ecological niche that was previously unfilled. Diadectids had a much wider geographic distribution than their relatives; while the distribution of limnoscelids is limited to parts of North America and Tseajaia is restricted to just the southwestern United States, diadectids are present in North America, Europe, and Asia. During the late Carboniferous and Permian these regions formed a single landmass called Laurasia, which comprised the northern portion of the supercontinent Pangea. For most of their evolutionary history, diadectids were likely limited to the western half of Laurasia, which is now North America and Europe. The presence of the late-surviving Alveusdectes in China suggests that diadectids radiated eastward across Laurasia. They could not have reached what is now China until the Middle Permian because, prior to that time, the Tethys Sea separated it from the rest of Laurasia. The group does not seem to have diversified to the same extent in the east as they did in the west given that no diadectids are known from Russia, which has an extensive fossil record of Early and Middle Permian tetrapod assemblages. ==PaleobiologyDiet=== Life restoration of Diasparactus Diadectids were the first fully herbivorous tetrapods. Although several other groups of early tetrapods independently acquired herbivory, diadectids were the only Carboniferous tetrapods that were able to process high-fiber terrestrial plants. Diadectids were also the most diverse group of herbivores, representing the first radiation of plant-eating tetrapods. Both Cope and Marsh recognized that diadectids were herbivores in 1878 when they studied their distinctively broad, cusped teeth (in his description of Diadectes, Cope mentioned, \\"animals belonging to this genus were, in all probability, herbivorous\\"). ===Locomotion=== Diadectids were once thought to be sprawling animals with their short, robust legs positioned to the sides of their large bodies. Despite this, several lines of evidence, including trackways and limb morphology, suggest that diadectids moved in a more erect posture. While earlier tetrapods possess several simple tarsal bones in their ankles, diadectids have a more complex astragalus formed from the fusion of these bones. Astragali are present in terrestrial amniotes and are identical in structure to those of diadectids. Therefore, the ankle structure of diadectids bears a closer resemblance to those of advanced terrestrial vertebrates like mammals and reptiles than those of earlier tetrapods. Since diadectids are the only diadectomorphs with astragali, they likely developed the structure independent of amniotes. Although they bear similarities to those of amniotes, the tarsal bones of diadectids are poorly ossified and loosely connected. The digits of the foot connect only to the fourth distal tarsal, providing a wide range of movement in the foot. This flexibility enabled diadectids to rotate their feet in a forward position while walking, providing greater force when pushing off. The feet could also be placed closer to the midline of the body to give diadectids an erect stance. Evidence for an erect stance can be found in trackways attributed to diadectids. The most well-preserved of these trackways are present in the Tambach Formation in central Germany. A 2007 study identified two different ichnospecies, Ichniotherium cottae and I. sphaerodactylum, as footprints of the diadectids Silvadectes absitus and Orobates pabsti, respectively. This was the first species-level identification of trackmakers of Paleozoic-era trackways, making the footprints the oldest yet associated with specific animal species. The close positioning of the footprints attributed to the more advanced diadectides suggests that the animals held their feet almost underneath their bodies, giving them a more efficient gait and to some degree paralleling the stance of mammals more than that of the sprawling amphibians and reptiles. ==ReferencesGeneral references== * Carroll, R.

She served with the Air Transport Auxiliary during World War II and was awarded the Order of Canada in 1986. ==Early life== Marion Alice Powell was born in Toronto, Ontario. On 5 January 1940 she obtained her private pilot's licence after working to pay for her flying lessons.Orr biography on Canadian 99s chapter website She then worked as an aircraft inspector at de Havilland Canada, and qualified for her commercial licence two years afterwards. She was the second woman in Canada to qualify as an air traffic control assistant. In 1942 she married D.K. \\"Deke\\" Orr. He helped her gain her instructor's licence in 1942. The marriage was brief and the couple separated later that year, although Marion Orr, as she was now known, would keep her married surname. ==World War II== After being told about the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) by Violet Milstead, she applied, was tested in Montreal and was admitted to the ATA. Orr and Milstead moved to England in the summer of 1942. Orr's first flight for the ATA was on 2 June 1943. Her favourite aircraft to fly was the Spitfire, which she considered \\"the most beautiful plane ever built.\\" She began her career ferrying airplanes across the Atlantic, according to her citation for the Order of Canada. The Maidenhead Heritage Centre, the Spiritual Home of the ATA, and the Royal Air Force Museum report that no ATA pilot ferried aircraft across the Atlantic. Her ATA record card in the RAF Museum shows she flew about 15 aircraft types, including the Airspeed Oxford, the only twin-engine machine. None of these types was capable of flying the Atlantic. Private communications with Chairman, Maidenhead Heritage Centre and Head of Archives, Royal Air Force Museum July 2014. Instead, she flew aircraft to and from factories, squadrons and other units. She was honourably discharged from the ATA with the rank of second officer in September 1944 with 700 logged hours. ==Post-war career, life and honours== Orr assumed the responsibility of Aero Activities Limited at Barker Field in 1947 and two years later acquired the company starting her own flying school in 1949. She was forced to close at Barker Field because the airfield was sold for developed purpose; Aero Activities Limited was relocated to Maple, Ontario where she had to get permission from the Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent to open her own airfield, Maple Airport. She was awarded the Ninety-Nines Inc. Medallion in 1976 in recognition of her outstanding achievements in the field of aviation. In 1981 Orr was named a member of Canada's Aviation Hall of Fame. During her career she flew over 21,000 hours, 17,000 hours as an instructor on single and twin- engine aircraft, on wheels, skis and floats, and helicopters. She also taught around 5000 people to fly. As one of Canada's most distinguished pilots, she was made a Member of the Order of Canada in 1993. Marion Orr continued to fly until her deteriorating health saw her licence revoked in 1994. She died in 1995 in an automobile accident. ==References== Category:1918 births Category:1995 deaths Category:People from Toronto Category:Canadian aviators Category:Women in World War II Category:Members of the Order of Canada Category:Air Transport Auxiliary pilots Category:Canadian female aviators ","title":"Marion Alice Orr"},{"id":"2230691","text":"Filthy Rich may refer to: * Filthy Rich (1982 TV series), a 1982 television series starring Dixie Carter and Delta Burke * Filthy Rich (1994 TV series), a series broadcast by the Hong Kong station TVB * Filthy Rich: Cattle Drive, a 2005 reality television series * Filthy Rich (2016 TV series), a 2016 New Zealand television series * Filthy Rich (2020 TV series), a 2020 American serialized satirical drama television series * Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich, a 2020 documentary TV series * Filthy Rich (game), a board game manufactured by Wizards of the Coast * Filthy Rich (comics), a 2009 original graphic novel written by Brian Azzarello * Filthy Rich, a rapper who released the 1996 album, All Frames of the Game * Filthy Rich, a minor character from My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic * Filthy Rich: A Fieldguide to a Dangerous Species, a book by Peter Robbins * Filthy Rich: A Powerful Billionaire, the Sex Scandal That Undid Him, and All the Justice That Money Can Buy: The Shocking True Story of Jeffrey Epstein, a 2017 book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein ==See also== * Filthy Rich & Catflap, a 1980s television sitcom * Filthy Riches, a 2017 American television series that aired on the National Geographic Channel ","title":"Filthy Rich"},{"id":"2230692","text":"Sandy & Junior were a Brazilian pop music duo consisting of siblings Sandy Leah Lima (born January 28, 1983) and Durval de Lima J√∫nior (born April 11, 1984). They first gained notoriety by being the children of Xoror√≥ from popular sertanejo duo Chit√£ozinho & Xoror√≥. Sandy & Junior began by singing children's songs and sertanejo-influenced tracks (their first single, \\"Maria Chiquinha\\", is a classic sertanejo song). Once they reached adolescence, they changed their style to pop-influenced songs, mainly ballads and upbeat songs. They became a pop phenomenon in Brazil with the release of the albums Era Uma Vez... Ao Vivo (1998), As Quatro Esta√ß√µes (1999), Quatro Esta√ß√µes: O Show (2000) and Sandy & Junior (2001), which sold more than 9 million copies together, receiving multiple diamond certificates.Certificados de Sandy Pro- M√∫sica Brasil √âpoca magazine compared their success to Beatlemania. One of the best-selling Brazilian artists of all time, Sandy & Junior sold over 20 million albums. They had a self-titled weekly television series between 1999 and 2002 on Rede Globo and released the movie Acqu√°ria in 2003; Sandy also starred in the soap opera Estrela-Guia in 2001. Earlier, they had appeared in Renato Arag√£o movie O Novi√ßo Rebelde, in 1997. On April 17, 2007 Sandy & Junior announced that an MTV Unplugged album to be recorded in May 2007 would be their final work together, through a video posted on their website addressed to their fans and in a press conference, stating also that their career as a duo would be over at the end of 2007. Both have experienced solo work: Junior as a record producer and Sandy as a solo singer. In March 2019, they announced the Nossa Hist√≥ria tour in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the duo's first televised performance, which took place in 1989. With several dates in stadiums, the tour had several extra dates to accommodate more fans. ==DiscographyStudio albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:14em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Details ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:13em;\\" Sales ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:13em;\\" Certications - ! scope=\\"row\\" Anivers√°rio do Tatu  * Released: 1991 * Label: Philips * Format: CD, LP, K7  * BRA: 310,000  * PMB: Gold - ! scope=\\"row\\" S√°bado √† Noite  * Released: 1992 * Label: Philips * Format: CD, LP, K7  * BRA: 400,000  - ! scope=\\"row\\" T√¥ Ligado em Voc√™  * Released: 1993 * Label: Philips * Format: CD, LP, K7  * BRA: 490,000  * PMB: Gold - ! scope=\\"row\\" Pra Dan√ßar Com Voc√™  * Released: 1994 * Label: Philips * Format: CD, LP, K7  * BRA: 500,000  - ! scope=\\"row\\" Voc√™ √© D+  * Released: 1995 * Label: Mercury/PolyGram * Format: CD, LP, K7  * BRA: 550,000  - ! scope=\\"row\\" Dig-Dig-Joy  * Released: 1996 * Label: Mercury/PolyGram * Format: CD, K7  * BRA: 700,000  * PMB: Gold - ! scope=\\"row\\" Sonho Azul  * Released: 1997 * Label: Mercury/PolyGram * Format: CD  * BRA: 780,000  * PMB: Platinum - ! scope=\\"row\\" As Quatro Esta√ß√µes  * Released: 1999 * Label: Mercury/Universal Music * Format: CD  * BRA: 2,500,000  * PMB: 2√ó Diamond - ! scope=\\"row\\" Sandy & Junior  * Released: 2001 * Label: Mercury/Universal Music * Format: CD  * BRA: 1,000,000  * PMB: 3√ó Platinum - ! scope=\\"row\\" Internacional  * Released: 2002 * Label: Mercury/Universal Music * Format: CD  * BRA: 700,000 * POR: 20,000  * PMB: Platinum - ! scope=\\"row\\" Identidade  * Released: 2003 * Label: Mercury/Universal Music * Format: CD, download digital  * BRA: 600,000  * PMB: Platinum - ! scope=\\"row\\" Sandy & Junior  * Released: 2006 * Label: Mercury/Universal Music * Format: CD, download digital  * BRA: 250,000  * PMB: Platinum } ===Live albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:14em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Details ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:13em;\\" Sales ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:13em;\\" Certications - ! scope=\\"row\\" Era Uma Vez...

Formerly, some authorities referred to this species as the crested hawk-eagle, a name that may cause some confusion as it is more commonly used for an Asian eagle species.Friedmann H. (1935). A new race of the Crested Hawk-eagle Spizaetus ornatus. Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences, 25 (10): 450-451. Like all eagles, it is in the family Accipitridae. This species has a feathered tarsus that marks it as a member of the Aquilinae or booted eagle subfamily.Lerner, H., Christidis, L., Gamauf, A., Griffiths, C., Haring, E., Huddleston, C.J., Kabra, S., Kocum, A., Krosby, M., Kvaloy, K., Mindell, D., Rasmussen, P., Rov, N., Wadleigh, R., Wink, M. & Gjershaug, J.O. (2017). Phylogeny and new taxonomy of the Booted Eagles (Accipitriformes: Aquilinae). Zootaxa, 4216(4), 301-320. This species is notable for the vivid colors and bold markings of adults, which differ considerably from the far more whitish plumage of the juvenile bird.Clark, W. S., & Schmitt, N. J. (2017). Raptors of Mexico and Central America. Princeton University Press. The ornate hawk-eagle ranges from central Mexico south through much of Central America and in a somewhat spotty but broad overall range into South America, including in the west apart from the Andes and broadly on the Atlantic side especially Brazil down to as far as Southeast Brazil and northern Argentina. This species is found largely in primary forests with tall trees, although can be found in many forest types. The ornate hawk-eagle female lays almost always a single egg and the species has a fairly prolonged breeding cycle like many tropical raptors, especially due to a lengthy post-fledging stage on which juveniles are dependent on their parents.Phillips, R.

Like many forest-dependent raptors, especially those in the tropical and subtropical regions, this species is likely under the pressing threat of deforestation. The decline of forest habitat in this species range, especially the Amazon rainforest, led the IUCN to uplist the ornate hawk-eagle as Near Threatened in 2016. ==Taxonomy== The ornate hawk-eagle is a member of the booted eagle subfamily, with the signature well-feathered tarsus present on both tropical and temperate species (and shared, presumably through convergent evolution, with a pair of buteonine hawks). It is one of four living members of the Spizaetus species of ‚Äúhawk- eagle‚Äù native to the neotropics. At one time Old World hawk-eagles, native to various southern areas of Asia, were also included in the Spizaetus genus. However, genetic studies have shown the Asian group of species to be paraphyletic, resulting in the Old World members being placed in Nisaetus (Hodgson, 1836) and separated from the New World species.Helbig, A.J, Kocum, A., Seibold, I. & Braun, M.J. (2005). A multi-gene phylogeny of aquiline eagles (Aves: Accipitriformes) reveals extensive paraphyly at the genus level.

Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research, 45(4), 353-365. The history of the American Spizaetus genus has been indicated by the diversity of hawk- eagles found in the fossil records in the United States and Mexico. At least five such species have been described, having presumably radiated from basal hawk-eagles of Asian origin across the Bering Land Bridge. Studies have indicated that some of these are ancestors of modern Spizaetus species, with the genera having been present in North America at least since the Pliocene.Martin, L. D. (1975). A new species of Spizaetus from the Pliocene of Nebraska. The Wilson Bulletin, 87(3), 413-416.Martin, L. D. (1971). An early Pleistocene eagle from Nebraska. The Condor, 73(2), 248-250. Some forms were considerably more massive than any extant hawk-eagle and indeed were likely to have exceeded the size of any living booted eagle. Fossil species such as Spizaetus willetti may have grown to similar sizes as the modern harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja).Howard, H. (1935). A new species of eagle from a Quaternary cave deposit in eastern Nevada. Condor 37:206-209.Howard, H. (1962). Bird remains from a prehistoric cave deposit in Grant County, New Mexico. The Condor, 64(3), 241-242. Studies based on the genetic markers indicated the black-and-white hawk-eagle (Spizaetus melanoleucus) and, especially, the black-and-chestnut eagle (Spizaetus isidori) are closely related to the ornate hawk-eagle, resulting in their respective former genera of Spizastur and Oroaetus being eliminated. The fourth neotropical hawk-eagle, the black hawk- eagle (Spizaetus tyrannus), has been found to be basal to the other extant species. Per genetic research, the ornate hawk-eagle and black-and-chestnut eagle are considered as sister species. The ornate hawk-eagle has been diagnosed to include two subspecies. The nominate subspecies (S. o. ornatus) occupies a good deal of the South American range of the species, including eastern Colombia, Venezuela and all of the species range in Brazil and points south. The second subspecies, S. o. vicarius, has been described to inhabit the discontinuous northern part of the range, extending from Mexico and Central America down through much of western Colombia and western Ecuador down as far south as El Oro.Iliff, M. (2010). Ornate Hawk-Eagle (Spizaetus ornatus), Neotropical Birds Online (TS Schulenberg, Editor). Ithaca: Cornell Lab of Ornithology. The subspecies seem to differ mostly in the plumage characteristics of adults. Whereas nominate birds are a more cinnamon-hued color on the neck with slightly paler ground color and sparser markings about the head and undersides, S. o. vicarius, tends to be darker overall, with a richer, deeper more rufous color around the neck, denser and darker markings overall and broader bands on the tail.de Schauensee, R. M. (1950). Colombian Zoological Survey. Part VII: A Collection of Birds from Bolivar, Colombia. Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 102, 111-139. ==Description== Immature, Dari√©n National Park (Panama) This is a medium-to- large sized species of raptor but a fairly small eagle. In the ornate hawk- eagle, the sexes are similar in appearance and overlap in size but like most birds of prey do show reverse sexual dimorphism, in which females outsize males to the contrary of most non-raptorial birds. The biggest female ornate hawk-eagles are 13% larger than biggest males, with an average of about 8% greater in nominate race. In Central America, in extreme cases, the largest females are as much as 50% heavier than the smallest males. The species is slightly smaller than the largest members of widespread raptor genera such as the largest Buteo and Falco species but is usually larger than other forest raptors in its range apart from vultures and other eagle species. The total length of full grown ornate hawk-eagle is .Howell, S. N., & Webb, S. (1995). A guide to the birds of Mexico and northern Central America. Oxford University Press.

Adult, Federal University of Mato Grosso zoo, Cuiab√° (Brazil). Ornate hawk-eagles largely perch within the tree canopy, but will sometimes be out on exposed branches especially earlier in the morning. Usually soaring activity peaks in the late morning. Brown & Amadon (1986) described the species are ‚Äúrather stolid and buteonine, despite the long tail and crest‚Äù.Brown, Leslie and Amadon, Dean (1986). Eagles, Hawks and Falcons of the World. The Wellfleet Press. . Adults are largely distinguishable by their rufous cowls and bold barring below.Fagan, J., & Komar, O. (2016). Peterson field guide to birds of northern Central America. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Furthermore, all ornate hawk-eagles bear a long erectile crest, which may variously be laid flat against the head, protrude straight up like a spike or sometimes hang at a slight curve. Adults when perched have an obvious black crown, crest and malar stripes (continuing to sides as isolated streaks) sets off by the rufous color on their cheeks, ear- coverts and sides of the neck and chest (sometimes completely covering their upper chests), the rufous shading into a somewhat browner rufous nape. On the upperside, they are barred blackish to dark brown with usually apparent white tips on the mantle and lesser wing coverts. Meanwhile, on the underside, they have a whitish base color which, other than the often plain throat, is boldly overlaid with black barring. This barring extends down to the abdomen and legs, while the crissum is spotted black. Like many forest raptors, the species has relatively short wings and a longish tail.Van Perlo, B. (2009). A field guide to the birds of Brazil. Oxford University Press. When perched, their wing tips slightly exceed their tail base. The tail is blackish with a creamy whitish tip and three broad pale bands, which are greyish above and whitish below, the basal bar often being obscured. According to Brown & Amadon ‚Äúthe perched bird seemingly has legs set very far forward, almost under the chest, thus giving the impression of posed readiness. The position of the black crest hints at the bird's temper at the moment‚Äù. Juvenile differ conspicuously in many respects, generally lacking most of the pigment visible in adults. Juveniles lack the adults‚Äô rufous collar, malar stripes and underside barring. Instead, the juvenile's whole head and underparts are white excepting thin black streaks on the crown and the tip of their crest. Some juvenile ornate hawk-eagles do, however, show variable, light dark brown barring and spotting on the flanks and thighs, at even may manifest a vestigial moustache on the face. The juvenile's back and wings are dark brown with white-tipped blackish shoulders. The tail is somewhat similar to the adult's but has a broader white tip and at least 4-5 thinner bands, which like those of the adult are greyish above and whitish below. By their 2nd year, the young hawk-eagles enter an intermediate or subadult plumage that quickly starts to resemble that of the adults but is rather more faded in appearance. The subadult's face is a sandy to pale rufous color with an indistinct malar stripe, while the flanks, belly and legs increasingly start to manifest barring and spotting. The subadult's back is still largely dark brown but tends to appear increasingly blackish. Adults have orangish-yellow eyes, with a dull greenish to grey color on the cere and bare lores, while the feet are rich cream to pale yellow. Juveniles have white to whitish-yellow eyes, a yellow to bluish-grey cere and brighter yellow to orange feet. Apparently, the legs of juveniles are often less thickly feathered than those of adults. In flight it may appear intermediate in size, being large relative to most forest raptors but rather small and slender-bodied for an eagle. The flying ornate hawk-eagle is prominent headed with short, broad rounded wings that show an emphasis on the bulging secondaries and pinch in at the bases of the trailing edges. Flight of the species is deep and powerful with the wings held flattish and pressed slightly forward, while the tail may be closed to slightly spread. From above, adult has a rufous cowl, a blackish mantle and a slightly brownish black back and wings with white-tipped shoulders and tail coverts. Below the underwing is paler looking relative to body with flecking or speckling only on the hand and thinly barred flight feathers. In flight, the juvenile ornate hawk-eagle is mainly dark brown above with whitish scaled blackish-brown shoulders. Below, the juvenile's wings have scattered spots on the axillaries and great wing-coverts, blackish tips to the white based outer primaries and thin barring on the other flight feathers, at times matching the patterning of the tail. By the 2nd year, there is an only moderate increase to the flecks and spots on the wing linings, as the flight feathers and tail are the last to molt away from the juvenile-like look to those like adults. Adult in flight, Dari√©n National Park (Panama). ===Confusion species=== While adult ornate hawk-eagles are obviously distinctly marked from most other raptors, one species strikingly resembles this predator, the juvenile of the gray-bellied hawk (Accipiter poliogaster) which is extremely different looking from the respective plumage of adult gray-bellieds. While not definitely proven, this is quite possibly a case of mimicry, as is known in other raptor assemblages wherein a less powerful species (the hawk) mimics a more powerful species (the hawk-eagle) presumably to mitigate potential predatory attacks.Menq, W. (2013). Mimicry in birds of prey. Aves de Rapina Brasil.Ellis, D. H., Bednarz, J. C., Smith, D. G., & Flemming, S. P. (1993). Social Foraging Classes in Raptorial Birds: Highly developed cooperative hunting may be important for many raptors. Bioscience, 43(1), 14-20.Duff, D. (2006). Has the juvenile plumage of Honey-buzzard evolved to mimic that of Common Buzzard? British Birds, 99, 118-128.Negro, J. J. (2008). Two aberrant serpent‚Äêeagles may be visual mimics of bird‚Äêeating raptors. Ibis, 150(2), 307-314. Distant gray- bellied hawks are best told apart by their very different proportions and build both in flight and perched. The gray-bellied hawks are typical of an Accipiter, having broader and much shorter wings, relatively more elongated tail and signature flap-flap-glide flight style. Although the gray-bellied hawk is by a slight margin the largest member of that genus in South America, it is still considerably smaller than the hawk-eagle, averaging about a third smaller in length. At close range, it may noticeably differ, beyond the size discrepancy, by the hawk being crestless and bearing relatively long, featherless and yellow legs. Black hawk-eagles are fairly similarly shaped and similarly sized as the ornate hawk-eagle when seen in flight but are slightly larger in appearance, being longer tailed and longer winged. Nonetheless, the ornate hawk-eagle usually is slightly heavier on average than the black hawk- eagle and may appear chestier in perched birds than the more gracile black species. Confusion with the adult black hawk-eagle is unlikely given that it is always much darker, appear solidly soot colored apart from its heavily barred wings. Juveniles and late first years stages of the black hawk-eagle are most likely to be confused in distant flight with perhaps a subadult ornate, however the juvenile black hawk-eagle is always much more heavily barred below with dark cheeks separating the white supericilia and throat. Haverschmidt (1968) mentioned a \\"dark morph\\" of the ornate hawk-eagle that he said was \\"nearly impossible\\" to distinguish from the black hawk-eagle but this is considered most likely to have been a misidentified black hawk-eagle in intermediate plumage.Haverschmidt, F. (1968). The birds of Surinam. Oliver & Boyd. The juvenile ornate hawk-eagle is potentially confusable with the black- and-white hawk-eagle but the latter is smaller with boxier wings, shorter crest, a bold orange cere, a strong black mask and a blacker upper-body with white leading edges. Also the black-and-white bears no spots or barring on its wings and has a plain white underbody. The black-and-white species is more similar to an Accipiter in proportions than the ornate species, having relatively less expansive wings and somewhat more elongated looking tail. Juveniles are told from the similar juvenile black-and-chestnut eagle by their smaller size and by having more extensive spots and barring on the under wing (giving the differences in altitudinal range, overlap in distribution is likely very minimal).Ridgely, R. S., & Greenfield, P. J. (2001). The birds of Ecuador. Vol. 2, A field guide. Christopher Helm. Juvenile hook-billed kite (Chondrohierax uncinatus) are also potentially confusable with juvenile ornates but the kite is much smaller and more dumpily built with more paddle- shaped wings, a squarer tail, with clearer bars on remiges and rectrices and bare tarsi. Another kite, the gray-headed kite (Leptodon cayanensis) can be considered similar in plumage in its adult plumage to the juvenile ornate but it is rather smaller with very different shape in all respects (especially in its small, pigeon-like head), completely different underwing pattern and unmarked body but for grey crown and nape. Pale juvenile crested eagles (Morphnus guianensis) appear much larger and longer tailed than juvenile ornate hawk-eagles with dark grey rather than dark brown backs, unbarred flanks and have a less marked hand in flight contrasting with more boldly barred primary quills. Despite the ornate species not infrequently being described as ‚Äúslim‚Äù, in actuality, the much bigger looking crested eagle is much lighter for its size and only averages about 30% heavier than the ornate (i.e. other eagle species around the same total length as the crested eagle weigh about three times as much as the ornate species).Smith, J. W. (2012). Crested Eagle (Morphnus guianensis), version 1.0. In Neotropical Birds Online (T. S. Schulenberg, Editor). Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA. Despite its somewhat similar plumage and appearance to the crested eagle, the harpy eagle is far more massive than the ornate hawk-eagle (nearly five times heavier on average) and unlikely to be confused with any plumage of the smaller species. ===Vocalization=== The main call known for the ornate hawk- eagle is a series of loud piping whistles. It is emitted by the soaring bird, usually male, and is often transcribed as whi whee-whee-wheep, the whee repeated anywhere from 2 to 9 times. Numerous variations are known are given in terms of transcription but most sources describe in roughly similar ways.Stiles, F. G., & Skutch, A. F. (1989). Guide to the birds of Costa Rica. Comistock.Ridgely, R. S., & Gwynne, J. A. (1989). A guide to the birds of Panama: with Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Honduras. Princeton University Press.Ffrench, R., O'Neill, J. P., & Eckelberry, D. R. (1991). Guide to the birds of Trinidad and Tobago. Illustrated by John P. O'Neill. Unlike the call of the black hawk-eagle, similarly done in flying display, the ornate hawk- eagle the introductory series of notes is more hurried and the last note more drawn out. It has been noted by some authors that the ornate species‚Äô call in nearly a reverse of the pattern of the calling black hawk-eagle which calls huwee-whee-whi-whi-wi-wi-wi, the first note being longest and slurred, second note highest, followed by descending short notes. While perched, ornate hawk- eagle may let out a ca-lee-oo followed by an accelerating series of excited sounding laughing notes. Other reported call include a qu-ouw reminiscent of a limpkin (Aramus guarauna) call and a cat-like scream when disturbed. Perched juveniles have a food begging call consisting of a loud, clear whistle, which is repeatedly irregularly and transcribed aswheeu or wheee. While nesting, the male when arriving with food announces his presence with a pitpit call repeated four times. The most common form of call by the female is emitted during food begging, a hui note, which is usually repeated about four times. She may also call out a sharp fli-fli-fli-flio when being mobbed by small birds. A further call was once attributed to an ornate hawk-eagle that was hunting a guan was a very deep growl, reminiscent of a big cat, to such a degree that the witnesses initially thought the guan was being pursued by a jaguar (Panthera onca). However, further analysis has indicated that it was the guan itself that had let out the big cat-like growl (possibly in an effort to startle the predator and perhaps successfully as the guan escaped) and not, in likelihood, the hawk-eagle itself.Slud, P. (1964). The birds of Costa Rica: distribution and ecology. Las aves de Costa Rica: distribuci√≥n y ecolog√≠a. Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist, 128, 1-430.Kilham, L. (1978). Alarm call of crested guan when attacked by ornate hawk-eagle. The Condor, 80(3), 347-348. ==Range and Habitat== The ornate hawk-eagle has the largest distribution of the nine species of eagle endemic to the neotropics, ranging over an estimated 20.2 million square kilometers in total. This is a largely sedentary species, but some local dispersal is known to occur and individuals wander into drier forest and higher altitudes than normal. The species ranges as far north as southeastern Mexico, where it is found on the Caribbean slope from southern Tamaulipas, on Pacific more infrequently in Jalisco and east Oaxaca. In their Mexican range, their status is uncertain in Colima, where it may be extirpated.Aranda, M., Burton, A., I√±igo-El√≠as, E., & Escalante, P. (2009). Registro del √°guila elegante (Spizaetus ornatus) en la Reserva de la Biosfera sierra de Manantl√°n, Jalisco-Colima, M√©xico. Revista mexicana de biodiversidad, 80(1), 265-268. Reportage of the species is known in the Mexican states of Guerrero and Nayarit but these could pertain to wandering individuals. Nesting remains unconfirmed throughout west Mexico and since most birds seen are juveniles, these could refer to post-dispersal wanderers.Webb, S., & Howell, S. (1993). New records of Hawk-eagles from Guerrero, M√©xico. Euphonia, 2, 19-21.Gonzalez, C. A., Guevara, E. P., Serrano, K. P., Soria, H. L., & Corona, R. S. (2004). A record of the Ornate Hawk-Eagle (Spizaetus ornatus) in Nayarit, Mexico. Journal of Raptor Research, 38(2), 193-194. The species is found almost continuously through Central America in Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua into Costa Rica and Panama (including the isle of Coiba). In Panama, it is much more numerous on the more humid Caribbean side than the drier slopes of the Pacific, being especially scarce in the Panama canal zone and Azuero Peninsula, but can occur in more humid parts of the Pacific side. A similar distributional favoring of the more humid Caribbean coast has been noted elsewhere in Central America as well. In South America, the range continues locally west of the Andes (formerly at least to tropical western Ecuador), being somewhat more commonly found north and east of the Andes in Colombia, northern and central Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, eastern Ecuador and the Guianas.Greeney, H.F., Gelis, R.A. & White, R. (2004): Notes on breeding birds from an Ecuadorian lowland forest. Bull. B.O.C. 124(1): 28-37. PDF fulltext In Brazil, it occupies nearly two- thirds of the large country south to Paran√° and marginally into Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul but is largely (if not entirely) absent from Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais and more or less the entirety of the northeast region. Their distribution continues through eastern Peru, northern, central and eastern Bolivia, southern Paraguay and northwestern (down to Tucum√°n) and northeastern Argentina (down to Santa Fe), though it has been wondered if the northeast occurrences are merely incidental wanderings of juveniles from adjacent populations. Despite its wide distribution, the species is frequently quite uncommon to increasingly rare in several parts of the range, though can outnumber other eagles (apart from the slightly more adaptable black hawk- eagle). This species dwells in well forested regions, preferring tall, wet or humid, tropical and subtropical forests. Although some of the species can dwell in dry tropical forest this is usually quite secondary habitat.Piana, R. P., Crespo, S., Angulo, F., Ormaeche, E., & Alzamora, M. (2010). Grey Hawk Buteo nitidus and Ornate hawk-Eagle Spizaetus ornatus in north-west Peru. Cotinga, 32, 106-108. More so than black hawk-eagles, the ornate hawk-eagle tends to be found primarily only in unbroken primary forest tracts. Some records indicate that the ornate hawk-eagle may persist on tracts of forest down to only but usually such extensive deforestation causes the species to vacate the area.Zorzin, G., Carvalho, C. E. A., Carvalho Filho, E. P. M., & Canuto, M. (2006). Novos registros de Falconiformes raros e amea√ßados para o estado de Minas Gerais.

However, they've been recorded wandering to in Costa Rica.Vaughan, C. (2011). Change in dense forest habitat for endangered wildlife species in Costa Rica from 1940 to 1977.

The species adapts quite well to cloud forest habitat which are usually at higher elevations than typical rainforest habitats (i.e. in primary cloud forest of southern Mexico, the ornate hawk-eagle was one of the two most frequently recorded raptor species).Robbins, M. B., & Ridgely, R. S. (1990). The avifauna of an upper tropical cloud forest in southwestern Ecuador.

Some ecological aspects of two primary evergreen forest raptor communities compared with cultivated tropical areas in southern Mexico. Meyburg, B.-U. & Chancellor, RD (eds): Raptors in the modern world. WWGBP: Berlin, London & Paris. 529-543 p. In some areas, the hawk-eagles may occasional habituate partially to edges, riversides and other openings, also into gallery strips and relatively short swamp forest. Deciduous forests, mixed pine-oak, taller stretches of secondary forests and shade coffee plantations, as long they have tall native tree canopies, may be visited and even locally nested in, as was recorded in Mexico.I√±igo-Elias, E., Ramos, M., & Gonz√°lez, F. (1987). Two recent records of neotropical eagles in southern Veracruz, M√©xico. The Condor, 89(3), 671-672. In Guatemala, they are often fairly distant from openings and dwell almost entirely in primary forest, especially areas where at least one very tall tree emerged above the average canopy level and there is less forest understory to more easily execute hunting. The Guatemalan hawk-eagles preferred fairly homogenous forest in drier upland parts of the humid forest, since the hilly areas of the forest tended to have more of the aforementioned habitat characteristic. However, the hawk-eagles here did sometimes occur in scrub-swamp forests as long as it retained tall trees, however the ornate hawk-eagles who nested in scrub-swamp forest type often went to the upland areas to hunt. ==Dietary habitats== Largish forest birds, such as this crested guan, are often favored in the diet. The ornate hawk-eagle is a powerful predator that readily varies its prey selection among two main prey groups. Largely the most significant prey for the species are medium to large sized birds. The other main prey type are a variety of small to medium-sized mammals. On occasion, reptiles may form a seldom part of the diet. This species largely forages inside forests, often perch-hunting. This entails short flights from tree to tree at mid-story heights while foraging or still- hunting from inconspicuous vantage points near the center of a dense canopy. Upon prey detection, they swoop to grasp the prey on the ground or in trees or engage in tail chases among trees.Lyon, B., & Kuhnigk, A. (1985). Observations on nesting ornate hawk-eagles in Guatemala. Wilson Bulletin, 97(2), 141-147. The agility imparted by its relative small and broad wings and longish tail and talent for tail-chases in enclosed woods and thickets are why this and similar eagles are referred to as ‚Äúhawk-eagles‚Äù, in reference to similar hunting styles in the ‚Äútrue hawks‚Äù i.e. the members of the Accipiter genus. In size, tail length and hunting style, the ornate hawk-eagle in particular is quite similar to the largest races of the largest Accipiter species, the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis).Acosta-Chaves, V., Granados, F., & Araya, D. (2012). Predation of Long-tailed Silky Flycatcher (Ptilogonys caudatus) by Ornate Hawk-Eagle (Spizaetus ornatus) in a cloud forest of Costa Rica. Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia, 20(4), 451-452. Most witnessed tail- chases by this species have involved chasing various gamebirds, with about equal accounts of successful and unsuccessful pursuits.Friedmann, H., & Foster, D. S. (1950). A contribution to the ornithology of northeastern Venezuela. Proceedings of the United States National Museum. In Guatemala, most attacks were launched when the hawk-eagle was from its quarry, with all successful attacks on prey on ground or low bushes and were from perches at high or lower in the trees. In Man√∫ National Park, Peru, most observed attacks were untaken within about of the prey and prey was attacked mostly on the ground, although they also captured rails from shallow water (in one case losing a gallinule rail to a nearby caiman before the hawk-eagle could carry it prey away).Robinson, S. K. (1994). Habitat selection and foraging ecology of raptors in Amazonian Peru. Biotropica, 443-458. In attacking Guianan cock- of-the-rock (Rupicola rupicola) on their mating lek, 2 of 8 attempted attacks by ornate hawk-eagles were successful (and were the only successful attacks of 56 total attempts, the other 48 by different raptor species). The hawk-eagles made bold, fast dives into the middle of the leks, quickly grabbing a male cock-of-the-rock. Subsequently, one hawk-eagle consumed the bird right on the spot in one case and the other took its catch to a nearby perch.Trail, P. W. (1987). Predation and antipredator behavior at Guianan cock-of-the-rock leks. The Auk, 104(3), 496-507. Reported instances of ‚Äúpower dives‚Äù into troops of monkeys and even heronries are probably similar in nature to the cock-of-the- rock attacks.Hilty, Steven L. (2003): Birds of Venezuela. Christopher Helm, London. In one case, an ornate hawk-eagle was able to capture a black vulture (Coragyps atratus) that had come to the carcass of a monkey that the hawk- eagle itself may have also killed.Dickey, D. R., & Van Rossem, A. J. (1938). The birds of El Salvador (Vol. 23). Field Museum of Natural History. In general, a picture has emerged that the ornate hawk-eagle is a particularly opportunistic predator, attracted to conspicuous prey behaviors and less deeply searching in its foraging than most co-existing forest eagles. In total, well over 100 prey species are known for ornate hawk-eagles.Zilio, F. (2017). Breeding biology and conservation of hawk-eagles (Spizaetus spp.)(Aves, Accipitridae) in southern Atlantic Forest, Brazil. Iheringia. S√©rie Zoologia, 107. Of particularly broad import to ornate hawk-eagles are the cracid family of gamebirds such as chachalacas, guans and curassows. In fact, local names refer to this species at times as the ‚Äúguan hawk‚Äù or the ‚Äúcurassow hawk‚Äù.Russell, S. M. (1964). A distributional study of the birds of British Honduras. Ornithological Monographs, 1.Lopez, R. R., Silvy, N. J., Peterson, M. J., Brooks, D. M., Baur, E. H., & Gonz√°lez-Garc√≠a, F. (2019). Curassows, Guans, and Chachalacas in Mexico. Wildlife Ecology and Management in Mexico, 77. At least twelve species of cracid are taken quite often where available, and this is probably only a partial list of the species they hunt.Retana, S.A.V., Araya-H.D., & Garc√≠a, R. (2016).

M., Zilio, F., & de Mendon√ßa-Lima, A. (2011). First record of breeding of the Ornate Hawk-Eagle (Spizaetus ornatus) in Southern Brazil. El hornero, 26(2), 163-166.G√≥mez de Silva, H. (2006). Mexico. North American Birds 60:290-295. However, the ornate hawk-eagle is far from specialized on cracid prey and takes more or less any medium-sized or larger avian prey they opportune upon. In total, about 65% of recorded prey species for ornate hawk-eagles are birds. Beyond cracids, some of the most significant prey families and orders are tinamou (at least 8 species), pigeons and doves (9 species or more), toucans (at least 7 species), parrots (at least 9 species) as well as assorted non-cracid gamebirds and largish passerines. In Tikal, Guatemala, the most often identified avian prey on 10 ornate hawk-eagle territories was the keel-billed toucan (Ramphastos sulfuratus), accounting for 11.3% of 408 prey items, followed by the plain chachalaca (Ortalis vetula) (6.5%) and great tinamou (Tinamus major) (4%) (in by far the largest dietary study conducted for this hawk-eagle). In total, birds were 56.3% of the foods for the species at the Tikal study. Another Guatemalan study observed 6 avian prey items and 1 mammal (bat) as prey as a hawk-eagle nest. The next largest known study, in rainforests near Manaus, Brazil, found among 82 prey items, birds made up 63.3% of the diet. The most often identified avian prey here were probable dusky-legged guan (Penelope obscura) (20.4%) and two species of large tinamous (12.24%). At a slightly smaller dietary study of the southern part of the Atlantic forest of Brazil found that 90% of 30 prey items were birds, principally brown tinamou (Crypturellus obsoletus) (33.3%), Leptotila doves (10%), dusky-legged guan and green-barred woodpecker (Colaptes melanochloros) (both 6.67%). Apparently, birds (including chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus)) were the main foods in Trinidad and Tobago. In a nest in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 14 of 15 prey items were assorted birds. More secondary avian prey recorded for ornate hawk-eagles includes cuckoos, potoos, rails, trumpeters, herons and egrets, vultures, owls, kingfishers, motmots and hoatzins (Opisthocomus hoazin).Wetmore, A., Pasquier, R. F., & Olson, S. L. (1965). The Birds of the Republic of Panama: Tinamidae (tinamous) to Rynchopidae (skimmers) (Vol. 1). Smithsonian Institution. However, at both Tikal and Manaus, the most often identified prey species types were mammals. In Tikal, the similar Yucatan squirrel (Sciurus yucatanensis) and the Deppe's squirrel (Sciurus deppei) lead the food by number, accounting for 28.2% of the foods. In Manu, unidentified species of large terrestrial rodents, either agoutis or the similar but smaller acouchis took the primary position, making up 24.4% of the diet. At a single nest in Henri Pittier National Park, Venezuela, without presented metrics, rodents and mammals were observed to outnumber birds in the diet, namely the red-tailed squirrel (Sciurus granatensis) and cotton rats (Sigmodon ssp.).Naveda-Rodr√≠guez, A. (2004). Contribution to the natural history of ornate hawk-eagle Spizaetus ornatus (Daudin, 1801) and great black-hawk Buteogallus urubitinga (Gmelin, 1788). Revista de Ecologia Latino-America, 11, 23-26. Among mammals, these medium to fairly large rodents regardless of whether they show terrestrial (agoutis and similar species) or arboreal (tree squirrels) tendencies make up the largest known portion of the food, perhaps most key being partially diurnal habits.Duquette, J. F., Ure√±a, L., Ortega, J., Cisneros, I., Moreno, R., & Flores, E. E. (2017). Coiban agouti (Dasyprocta coibae) density and temporal activity on Coiba Island, Veraguas, Panama. Mammal study, 42(3), 153-161. Another widely recorded mammalian prey ground are procyonids despite a slight penchant for more nocturnal activity, including such prey as raccoon (Procyon lotor), white-nosed coati (Nasua narica), kinkajou (Poto flavus) and cacomistle (Bassariscus sumichrasti). Usually the hawk-eagles are likely to target juveniles of the larger species of procyonid, although adults at least up to the size of kinkajous may be taken.Cima, A., Far√≠as, G., Zapotecos, U., de Ju√°rez, C., & de M√©ndez, C. (2018). Enhancing our knowledge on the Ornate Hawk-Eagle (Spizaetus ornatus) through community-based monitoring records from Tropical Mexico. Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia, 26(3), 196-201. However, certainly the most well-studied mammalian prey for ornate hawk-eagles are New World monkeys, which they do not hunt necessarily seem to hunt preferentially. However, they are unlikely to ignore an opportunity to prey upon primates.Peres, C. A. (1993). Anti-predation benefits in a mixed-species group of Amazonian tamarins. Folia Primatologica, 61(2), 61-76. Among monkeys, mainly those of a smaller size class are hunted, largely such groups as squirrel monkeys, tamarins, marmosets and titi monkeys are attacked. In most such monkey species, adults usually weigh less than , and juveniles may be slightly more regularly taken even for species this small.Greco, M. V., Andrade, M. A., Carvalho, G. D.

Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 23(3), 187-197. Due to the range of predators that they attract given their relatively smaller size, monkeys in the neotropics are highly wary and have well-developed anti-predator defenses, especially a variety of alarm calls, grouping techniques, great arboreal agility and aggressive defensive attacks by top males, all of which make monkeys more difficult to attack than more solitary, terrestrial and/or slower-moving mammal prey of similar size.Ferrari, S. F., & Ferrari, M. A. L. (1990). Predator avoidance behaviour in the buffy-headed marmoset, Callithrix flaviceps. Primates, 31(3), 323-338.Heymann, E. W. (1990).

Production and perception of situationally variable alarm calls in wild tufted capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella nigritus). Behavioral ecology and sociobiology, 64(6), 989-1000. Relatively few mammalian prey are taken outside of rodents, procyonids and monkeys, but ornate hawk-eagles are also known to take Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis), a few species of opossum, silky anteaters (Cyclopes didactylus) and even apparently bush dogs (Speothos venaticus). One reported instance of scavenging on carrion has been reported for this hawk- eagle, on the carcass of a domestic cow (Bos primigenius taurus).Jonesand, S. E. I., & Dorward, L. J. (2014). Possible scavenging behavior in Ornate Hawk- Eagle (Spizaetus ornatus) in Amazonas, Brazil. Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia-Brazilian Journal of Ornithology, 22(1), 5. Apart from mammals and birds, only rarely does the ornate hawk-eagle seem to hunt reptiles (i.e. lizards and unidentified snakes). While in many dietary studies no reptiles were known to be taken, in the Manaus area of Brazil reptiles made up nearly 4.1% of the diet. The size of prey taken can be quite variable for ornate hawk-eagles. In one estimate, most prey (specifically avian types) was estimated to weigh between . In the large study of Tikal, Guatemala, the size of prey items was estimated to weigh from for the Jamaican fruit bat to for the great curassow (Crax rubra). Another prey item taken of similar size to the fruit bat is the Mexican mouse opossum (Marmosa mexicana) and these two species are the smallest known mammalian prey for ornate hawk-eagle. The smallest avian prey recorded thus far is the long-tailed silky-flycatcher (Ptilogonys caudatus). Otherwise, passerine prey taken are slightly larger, usually various jays and icterids, resulting in persistent mobbing of hawk- eagles by species such as brown jays (Psilorhinus morio) (this loud mobbing of the hawk-eagles in Central America in turn allows researchers to more easily find the raptors). Despite the ornate hawk-eagles‚Äô notable predatory power and ability to take large prey, mean prey sizes taken in a couple of estimates are not exceptional relative to their own body mass, though are perhaps slightly higher than those for most similarly sized raptors.Marti, C. D., Korpim√§ki, E., & Jaksiƒá, F. M. (1993). Trophic structure of raptor communities: a three- continent comparison and synthesis. In Current ornithology (pp. 47-137). Springer, Boston, MA. In the Tikal study, mean prey size was estimated at , with avian prey averaging an estimated and mammal prey (which consisted largely of squirrels) averaging an estimated . In the smaller dietary study from the Atlantic forests of Brazil, estimated mean prey size was . Thus mean prey sizes from the two studies averages at about 34-42% of the hawk-eagle's own body size. Within their enclosed forest habitats, ornate hawk-eagle are capable of attacking much of the largest avian prey available, excepting larger birds of prey (the largest regional water birds such as storks rarely enter deep forest habitat). This species is capable of tackling healthy prey weighing up to at least four times its own weight. These include the aforementioned great curassow and the ocellated turkey (Meleagris ocellata), of which the ornate hawk-eagle is capable of taking adults weighing or more.Baur, E. H. (2008). Structure of a lowland neotropical galliform bird guild (Doctoral dissertation, University of Florida). Mammalian prey taken can reach an estimated in the case of a Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata). Other mammalian prey including the largest procyonids and monkeys hunted by the hawk-eagle can reach similar body masses, i.e. approximately and perhaps even up to around . Of a similar size range to these largest birds and mammals, numerous successful attacks have reported on adults of the green iguana (Iguana iguana), which weigh an average of about .Clinton-Eitniear, J. Gartside, M. R., & Kainer, M. A. (1991). Ornate Hawk-Eagle feeding on green iguana. The Journal of Raptor Research, 25(1), 19-20. When capturing such large prey, ornate hawk-eagles are incapable of flying with them. In the case of agoutis and curassows killed in Tikal, the hawk-eagles would return repeatedly to feed on their kill, ultimately consuming about half of the bodies before decomposition sets in. A male ornate hawk-eagle that had killed a great tinamou of roughly equal weight to itself (both around ) was similarly grounded after being unable to fly with its kill (only consuming the head before being flushed by researchers). ===Interspecies relations=== The ornate hawk-eagle overlaps in distribution with many raptors, including other powerful eagles. Furthermore, there appears to be considerable habitat selection overlap between these species, including both black-and-white hawk- eagle and black hawk-eagle, although the latter is somewhat more adaptable to openings and forest fragmentation. Furthermore, the larger species such as the crested and harpy eagle are largely concurrent in distribution and habitat with the ornate hawk-eagle. While interspecies relations of neotropical eagles are relatively poorly known, it is likely that there is some degree of natural partitioning to allow the raptors to co-exist.Brown, L. (1977). Eagles of the World. Universe Books. To the best knowledge of ornithologists and other researchers, the most likely form of partitioning comes in the form of the dietary preferences. While the three lowland hawk-eagles select broadly similar prey species across their prey spectrum, each focuses primarily on a different prey group. While the largest dietary study from Tikal, Guatemala showed that ornate hawk-eagle somewhat prefers relatively larger class birds, such as cracids. tinamous and toucans, alternately with smallish, primarily diurnal mammals, adjacent studies in Tikal of the black hawk-eagles shows they primarily hunted small, nocturnal mammals such as bats and mouse opossums.Sixto, H. F. (1992). Reproductive biology, food habits, and behavior of the Black Hawk Eagle in Tikal National Park. Maya Project: use of raptors and other fauna as environmental indices for design and management of protected areas for building local capacity for conservation in Latin America, progress report V. The Peregrine Fund Inc., Boise, ID USA, 173-178. Other (but not all) studies also indicate a preference for mammals of varying sizes (perhaps to the size of raccoons) in the diet of black hawk-eagles.Sick, H. 1993. Birds in Brazil: a natural history. Princeton University Press.Rangel- Salazar, J.L. & Enriquez-Rocha, P.L. (1993). Nest Record and Dietary Items for the Black Hawk-Eagle (Spizaetus tyrannus) from the Yucatan Peninsula. Journal of Raptor Research, 27 (2):121-122. Meanwhile, black-and-white hawk-eagles have been indicated to show a preference for slightly smaller birds than those selected by ornate hawk-eagles, such as medium-to-large passerines, pigeons and smallish toucans (such as aracaris and toucanets), though capable of preying on adult ducks and even monkeys quite as large as those taken by the ornate. The most similar hawk-eagle by diet is the closely related black-and- chestnut eagle, as this often hunts gamebirds such as cracids and procyonids like the ornate, but this species has a different altitudinal range being found in forests in the high montane forests, usually at a minimum elevation of .Restrepo-Cardona, J. S., M√°rquez, C., Echeverry-Galvis, M. √Å., Vargas, F. H., S√°nchez-Bellaiz√°, D. M., & Renjifo, L. M. (2019). Deforestation May Trigger Black-and-Chestnut Eagle (Spizaetus isidori) Predation on Domestic Fowl. Tropical Conservation Science, 12, 1940082919831838.Fjelds√•, J., & Krabbe, N. (1990). Birds of the High Andes. Zoological Museum, University of Copenhagen. Other eagle-like forest raptors such as solitary eagles (Buteogallus solitarius), whose mountainous range (similar to the black-and- chestnut) barely abuts the altitudinal range with ornate hawk-eagle, have strongly different dietary preferences (i.e. snakes) while other Buteogallus species tend to be much more aquatically based both in diet and habitat preferences.Seminario, Y., Phillips, R., & Curti, M. (2011). Observations of the Post-fledging Behavior and Prey of the Solitary Eagle (Harpyhaliaetus solitarius). Journal of Raptor Research, 45(3), 261-265. Overlap in the prey spectrum is known with both crested and harpy eagles, but dietary preferences differ considerably. In the harpy eagle, preferred prey are sloths (which have never been known to fall prey to ornate hawk-eagles) and larger sized New World monkeys.Mu√±iz-L√≥pez, R. (2007). Ecology, biology and habitat of the Harpy Eagle (Harpia harpyja). Pp. 191-244 in P. Tufi√±o (ed.), Cunsi Pindo: conservation of the Harpy Eagle in Ecuador. SIMBIOE, Quito, Ecuador. (In Spanish).Aguiar-Silva, F. H., Sanaiotti, T. M., & Luz, B. B. (2014). Food habits of the Harpy Eagle, a top predator from the Amazonian rainforest canopy. Journal of Raptor Research, 48(1), 24-36. Meanwhile, the crested eagle seems to prefer intermediately sized mammals, including monkeys mostly between tamarin and capuchin monkey-sized, but to also seemingly take prey of more varied classes than other lowland forest eagles.Lehmann V.,F.C. 1943. El genero Morphnus [The genus Morphnus]. Caldasia 2:165-179. In Tikal, like the black hawk-eagle, the crested eagle appears to prefer nocturnal mammals, mostly various opossums, and presumably has a more intensive searching method of hunting rather than the opportunistic hunting typical of the ornate species. In terms of predation on monkeys, a guild of avian predators and a corresponding forest wild cat appear rather neatly partitioned by the size of monkeys being hunted: Spizaetus eagles as well as other relatively small but powerful raptors and margays (Leopardus wiedii) select the smaller size monkey species, crested eagles and ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) mainly hunt the medium-sized monkeys and harpy eagles and jaguars focus most exclusively on larger sized monkeys.Urbani, B. (2005). The targeted monkey: a re-evaluation of predation on New World primates. Journal of Anthropological Sciences, 83, 89-109.Aparecido Lib√≥rio, R., & Moura Martins, M. (2013). Body size in predator‚Äìprey interactions: an investigation of Neotropical primates and their predators. Studies on neotropical fauna and environment, 48(1), 81-87. The various forest eagles of the neotropics appear to be surprisingly tolerant of other species, with almost no aggressive interspecies interactions known in the literature. Mostly only vultures seem to provoke a slight aggressive reaction from the parents in nesting ornate hawk-eagles (possibly because some studies indicate that forest-foraging vultures are more commonly egg thieves than those found in more open habitats). Although, in one Guatemalan study the presence of flying black hawk-eagles and swallow-tailed kites (Elanoides forficatus) (which are unlikely to prey on nests) also provoked a defensive whistle by the brooding female ornate hawk-eagle.Houston, D. C. (1986). Scavenging efficiency of turkey vultures in tropical forest. The Condor, 88(3), 318-323.Houston, D. C. (1985). Evolutionary ecology of Afrotropical and Neotropical vultures in forests. Ornithological Monographs, 856-864. Indicating a lack of interspecies aggression, one active harpy eagle nest was set with a camera trap captured photographs of a pair of ornate hawk-eagles in a breeding display in the immediate vicinity of the nest, with both species apparently indifferent to each other's presence.Aguiar-Silva, F. H., Jaudoin, O., Sanaiotti, T. M., Seixas, G. H., Duleba, S., & Martins, F. D. (2017). Camera trapping at Harpy Eagle nests: interspecies interactions under predation risk. Journal of Raptor Research, 51(1), 72-79. ==Breeding== A captive adult, photographed near the Loreto Region, Peru. Ornate hawk-eagles, like most but not all raptors, live solitarily or in pairs. Breeding territories are maintained through high circling, either by a solo adult or by a pair. Most displays occur in mid to late morning and are usually at fairly low heights with occasional calling. Sometimes one bird breaks into butterfly- like flight with shallow flutters during display. Other noisy acrobatics are engaged by the male while the female perches, some of which are correlated with courtship. In a mutual display, the pair gliding in tight circles, the male approaching the female from above and behind, as the female rolls to her back and they engage in talon grabbing, occasionally touching. The aerial display of the ornate hawk-eagle can escalate into roller coaster sky-dance involving series of dives at about 45 degrees on half-closed wings interspersed with heavy looking climbs and floppy beats with looping gyrations and occasionally a complete loop. Home range size is variable in different seasons, from and estimated density can vary from one 1 bird per to 13 birds per in parts of Guatemala and French Guiana, respectively. In Tikal, Guatemala, adult birds of both sexes used an average of , occasionally ranging up to at least . Here the mean nearest nest distance was estimated at .Julio, A., Madrid, M., H√©ctor, D., Sixto, H., Funes, A., Lopez, J., Botzoc, G.R. & Ramos, A. (1991).

The Peregrine Fund Inc., Boise, ID USA, 93-13. In the much sparser population of the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, it was estimated that there was one pair per each . In the Pet√©n area of Guatemala there is an estimated nesting density of one pair per .Bierregaard, R. O. (1994). Ornate Hawk-Eagle. Spizaetus ornatus. Page 205 in J. del Hoyo, A. Elliot, and J. Sargatal (editors), Handbook of the birds of the world. Volume 2, New World vultures to Guineafowl. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona. The Tikal studies shows evidence of pairs shifting their territorial boundaries, in some cases this has been apparently and surprisingly due to the intrusion of another ornate hawk-eagle. Per the study: \\"Perhaps in these formidably armed bird predators, territory occupants sometimes readjust their patterns of spatial use rather risk outright aggressive contest\\". Ornate hawk-eagles can typically only breed every other year, unless a prior year's nesting attempt fails. Breeding cycles are known to be more prolonged in tropic raptors than in those that dwell in temperate zones. Also tropical species usually have smaller brood sizes. The dichotomy in breeding habits is often most extreme in forest-dwelling tropical raptor species, which in large species tend to have an extremely prolonged post-fledging care stage for young raptors.Blake, E. R. (1977). Manual of Neotropical birds (Vol. 1). University of Chicago Press.Thiollay, J. M. (1985). Species diversity and comparative ecology of rainforest falconiforms on three continents. Conservation studies on raptors. ICBP Technical Publication, (5), 167-174.Skorupa, J. P. (1989). Crowned eagles Strephanoaetus coronatus in rainforest: observations on breeding chronology and diet at a nest in Uganda. Ibis, 131(2), 294-298. The breeding season of ornate hawk- eagles normally falls between December and September in Central America, while it is largely in August‚ÄìJanuary in Brazil. Courtship and nesting behavior were seen in Panama during August to October (later in the year than nearby black hawk-eagles, implying a temporal difference in nesting times for the two species).Canuto, M. (2008). Observations of two hawk-eagle species in a humid lowland tropical forest reserve in central Panama. Journal of Raptor Research, 42(4), 287-293. In Trinidad and Tobago, nest building is around November while in Venezuela was reportedly in March. This species seemingly lays its clutches in the dry season and fledges in the early wet season. In Tikal, Guatemala, the mean egg laying time was mid-March, while in Belize it was similar but slightly earlier in March. In the extensive studies from Tikal, eggs were laid variously anytime from November to May, but 83% were between January and April. Meanwhile, in the Manaus area of Brazil egg laying peaks in August, although copulation has been witnessed as long before than as in June, which may imply a particularly prolonged courtship stage. Copulation typically lasts for 6‚Äì12 seconds with 60 copulations recorded in 204 hours of observation. ===Nests=== This species builds a bulky, large stick nest that is generally typical of an accipitrid. Nests are exclusively located in trees. The nest height is often above the ground. Two nests in Guatemala were about both in trees of a total height of around while, in Belize, the nest height of 3 were from in trees of a total height of . In Tikal, 14 nests were found to be at anywhere from above the ground with an average of and an average total nesting tree height of . Nest heights in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil were between . Tree species are often variable, the most significant factor in the seeming selection of nesting trees is that it is often the tallest tree in the forest stand, emerging above the average canopy height. In Tikal, 6 nests were in Honduran mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), 4 were in kapok or ceiba trees (Ceiba pentandra), two in invasive black olive (Olea europaea) and single nests in various genera such as Ficus, Piscidia, Cedrela, Pouteria and Calophyllum. Further studies show that ceiba trees are popular elsewhere in the northern part of the range. Nests are placed in relatively exposed branches, often being on the main crutch of the tree or the largest, most bare branch (in comparison, black hawk-eagle nests are more difficult to find since they are typically inside the denser foliage of the canopy). Typical sized nests are about across and about deep. 16 nests in Tikal averaged in diameter and in outer depth. In the Manaus area of Brazil, a single nest was a relatively large in diameter. In Henri Pittier National Park, Venezuela one nest was observed to be diameter by deep. One record sized nest in terms of depth apparently reached deep and included sticks of up to diameter. ===Eggs=== Ornate hawk-eagles typically lay only a single egg. All nests of the species in the wild are known to contain only a single egg. Single egg clutches are also laid by other Spizaetus hawk-eagles.Kiff, L. F., & Cunningham, M. (1980). The egg of the Ornate Hawk Eagle (Spizaetus ornatus). Journal of Raptor Research, 14, 51. However, in captivity, at least one female has been known to lay a two egg clutch. The eggs are mainly white in color sparingly overlaid with brownish or brown-red splotches. In texture, the eggs are not glossy and are somewhat pitted to the touch. In Tikal, the eggs averaged (in a sample of four) and weighed typically about . The two egg clutch recorded in captivity differed in many respects from those of wild Guatemalan hawk-eagles. They were smaller, the first measuring and weighing , the second measuring and weighing . Additionally, instead of being whitish with faint brown or reddish spotting, they were unspotted and bluish-white in color. ===Parental behavior=== Prior to egg-laying, the female may remain in the area of the nest 97.2% of the time while the male was in the vicinity only 30.4% of the time in Tikal. Both prior to egg laying and during incubation, the female of the pair often collects green leaves to line the nest bowl, doing so nearly every day both in Guatemala and the Manaus area of Brazil. The female takes a lion's share of the incubation duties. For example, records from Guatemala and Belize show she incubates about 95-97% of observed hours. In 127 hours in Guatemala, she left her egg unattended only for a period of 9 minutes. Incubation lasted for 43 to 48 days in Tikal while in Belize incubation was for 44 to 46 days. As in most accipitrids, males usually capture prey and bring it to the female throughout incubation. When delivering prey, the male and female may call back and forth for several minutes before exchanging the prey item. Furthermore, in Guatemala, the male would relieve the female for any amount of time from 9 minutes to 68 minutes while the female fed, in Brazil he never approached the nest but in one case attempted to and was aggressively displaced by his larger mate. Prey deliveries are done foot-to-foot, and in Tikal the females would immediately behead each mammal or remove the beak from each bird prey item brought to her. During both incubation and subsequent to hatching, both parents may defend their offspring from potential predators, but especially the female. Vultures seem to provoke an aggressive response in different parts of the range, consisting of the female raising her crest, mantling over her egg and calling loudly. Egg-eating mammals seem to provoke a more active anti-predator defense. In Brazil, red- faced spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus) were seen to be attacked and swooped upon by the female, but in a second encounter during which the monkey troop returned, she remained on the nest. Similar anti-predator behavior was observed in Guatemala, where Geoffroy's spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) were flown at and struck until they left the vicinity. In another Guatemalan encounter, a tayra (Eira barbara), a large arboreal mustelid, was observed to be scaling a nest tree and was knocked out of the tree by the female hawk- eagle twice, fleeing after the second time this occurred. Studies from Guatemala show that humans also draw the ire of the female ornate hawk-eagle. It was found that while climbing to a tree blind near the nest tree that females regularly struck researchers, often causing lacerations even with protective gear on, and were rated as considerably more aggressive in nest defense than black hawk-eagles and crested eagles. In Oaxaca, Mexico, a researcher was struck instead by the male of an ornate hawk-eagle pair. In the Manaus, perhaps because of a larger regional human population causing more shyness or desensitization to human activities, female ornate hawk-eagles were less aggressive to humans in the nest vicinity and did not respond even to workers using chainsaws within of the nest. ===Nesting development=== A young ornate hawk-eagle in the wild. The hatching date in this species is, of course, dependent on when the eggs are laid. Studies from the Tikal area showed 90% of hatching occurred between February and June, peaking between late April and early May. It is likely that the hatching period here is timed with the peak time for fledging of other bird species for easy prey capture. Hatching was observed at a single nest in Trinidad and Tobago in March. In Manaus, Brazil, hatching occurred in September. In Venezuela, the hatchling eagle was found to measure in length and weigh . The studies from Tikal and Manaus describe details of the nestling development over time. Like most birds, and especially birds of prey, the hatchlings are initially altricial. In this species, the eaglets are still unable to lift their heads at 2‚Äì4 days old. By about two weeks of age, the young eaglet can start to stand on its folded leg within the nest. The begging calls will increase at about 3 weeks of age. A case in Guatemala of a 16 day old nestling trying to feed itself and defecate over the nest edge is considered rather early for both behaviors. At 36 days, the young hawk-eagle may begin to peck at carcasses but at 49 days cannot still effectively fed itself, with the first food tearing and eating recorded at between 52 and 54 days of age. At 39 days, the feathers of the wing and the tail begin to overtake the down. By the 8th week, the eaglet should be able to stand, wing flap and play with sticks within the nest. A week later, the young tend to be markedly more independent, largely feeding themselves on the carcasses their parents provide and ranging out of the nest for the first time on branches up to from their nest, often flapping their wings a considerable amount. Fledging may occur at any age from 60 to 93 days. The average age at fledgling was estimated as 77.5 days in Tikal while in Belize it was similarly in the range of 70 to 84 days. At 12 weeks, the full juvenile plumage is attained. Despite the full plumage and powers of flight, the juvenile hawk-eagles continue to linger in the vicinity of the nest, typically venturing no further than from the nest for months. The young eagles often continue to beg loudly for food, especially once their parents are in view, but if their crop is full they often retire to quietly sit in dense foliage. In one case from Brazil, the juvenile eagle was observed to fly up to greet one of its parents and grabbed the prey item without landing before continuing to a nearby perch. In Guatemala, 3 young males were still in away from the nest at 5 months of age. In the same area, 2 females of 9 months age were typically away from the nest while another two young females of the same age were at an average distance from the nest of . At 11‚Äì12 months, the juveniles may begin to soar around their parents‚Äô territory. 3 females in Tikal gradually increase their wanderings at 12‚Äì14 months old, ranging anywhere from to from the nest. Around a year of age, the juvenile eagles are likely to make their first attempts to hunt prey. The minimum age at which independence appears to be possible for ornate hawk-eagles is around 11.5‚Äì12 months. The average age of independence in studies from Tikal was found to 15.4 months of age for 13 banded juveniles. More poorly known is the age of maturity, which has been estimated at only two years, a matter of months after independence and when the hawk-eagles appear to enter their subadult plumage stage. There is little inconvertible evidence that the species begins breeding at any younger than three years of age. At least one case in Tikal was observed of a pair both in subadult plumage that was breeding, however. While breeding success rates are not known for this species this same subadult breeding pair was observed to kill and cannibalize a juvenile from another territory. When a nest was in imminent risk of flooding from the overflow of a nearby reservoir in southern Brazil, a pair of ornate hawk-eagles appeared to accept translocation when researchers relocated an entire nest intact with nestling in tow to nearby tree, at away.Joenck, C. M., Zilio, F., & de Mendonca-Lima, A. (2013). Successful translocation of a nestling Ornate Hawk- Eagle (Spizaetus ornatus) in southern Brazil. Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia, 21(2), 136-140. In interspecies comparisons, Tikal studies showed that black hawk-eagles are independent slightly faster at around 12 months old but, like the ornate, also reach maturity roughly in the zone of 2 to 3 years of age while crested eagles take 22.7‚Äì30 months until independence and start breeding somewhere around 3 to 4 years of age.Greeney, H. F., Gelis, R. A., & White, R. (2004). Notes on breeding birds from an Ecuadorian lowland forest. BULLETIN-BRITISH ORNITHOLOGISTS CLUB, 124(1), 28-37. In many of the larger eagles, including the harpy eagle, whether tropical or temperate zone dwelling, the minimum age of maturity seems to be around 5 years of age and in some large Afro-tropical species, possibly ranges up to more than 7 years of age.Rettig, N. L. (1978). Breeding behavior of the harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja). The Auk, 95(4), 629-643.Steyn, P. (1983). Birds of prey of southern Africa: Their identification and life histories. Croom Helm, Beckenham (UK). 1983. ==Status== Spiza√´tus ornatus, an artist's depiction of it from 1808 or earlier. The ornate hawk-eagle is, like many large birds of prey, probably naturally scarce. However, the species has shown a marked declining trend. Therefore, in 2012, the species was uplisted to Near Threatened. Currently the total population is estimated at between 13,300 and 33,300 individuals, a very small population considering the species‚Äô ample range. Various means of analysis in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil all showed it to be least densely populated of the three species of Spizaetus in the area. In particular, when compared to the black hawk-eagle, the ornate hawk-eagle is much less tolerant of partial deforestation and human disturbance and is generally rather more scarce. For example, in the fragmented forest of Paranapiacaba, Brazil, the black hawk-eagle was recorded 2.5 times more frequently during surveys than the ornate species.Ma√±osa, S., Mateos, E., Pedrocchi, V., & Martins, F. C. (2002). Birds of prey survey (Aves: Cathartiformes and Accipitriformes) in the Paranapiacaba forest fragment. Mateos, E.; Guix, JC, 165-179. The species is locally extinct in several former parts of the range. It is thought to have gone extinct early due to increased extensive 19th century colonization in Tumbes, Peru as well as the Bel√©m and probably the S√£o Francisco regions of Brazil.Schulenberg, T. S., Stotz, D. F., Lane, D. F., O'Neill, J. P., & Parker III, T. A. (2010). Birds of Peru: revised and updated edition (Vol. 63). Princeton University Press.Moura, N. G., Lees, A.

Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia, 14(4), 405-409. More recently, the continued presence of breeding ornate hawk-eagles was considered doubtful or at critical threat level in western Ecuador and local biologists considered the species to be extirpated from Colima, Mexico. Evidence indicates declines are likely occurring in almost every part of the species‚Äô distribution. Biologists working in Southeastern Brazil felt that the species, though still present, should be uplisted to regionally critically endangered.Ribon, R., Simon, J. E., & Theodoro De Mattos, G. (2003). Bird extinctions in Atlantic forest fragments of the Vi√ßosa region, southeastern Brazil. Conservation Biology, 17(6), 1827-1839.Albuquerque, J. L. (1995).

Journal of Field Ornithology, 363-369. Increases or apparent breeding records of the species in new areas are likely not correlated to actual population increases but are more likely cases of the species being driven from adjacent areas as habitats become unacceptable, accounting for increased records of the species at drier forests (i.e. in Mexico) or in higher elevations (i.e. in Colombia).Donegan, T. M. (2012). Range extensions and other notes on the birds and conservation of the Serran√≠a de San Lucas, an isolated mountain range in northern Colombia. Bull Brit. Orn. Cl, 132, 140-161. What were considered possible range expansions in different areas of Brazil, such as the Caatinga (Serra das Confus√µes National Park) and Rio Grande do Sul, as well as in northwestern Peru, may be more likely mere cases of more extensive bird surveying in previously little studied areas.Cerqueira, P.

D., Canfield, T., & Sucre, L. (2005). A delicate balance: Conservation and development scenarios for Panama's Coiba National Park. Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, 47(5), 24-39. The leading cause, by far, for the species decline is epidemic levels of deforestation. The terribly extensive deforestation of several areas of the neotropics, particularly the Amazon rainforest, was the catalyst for the species being uplisted in 2012.Lees, A. C., & Peres, C. A. (2006). Rapid avifaunal collapse along the Amazonian deforestation frontier. Biological Conservation, 133(2), 198-211.Barrett, S. W. (1980). Conservation in Amazonia. Biological Conservation, 18(3), 209-235. Declines are correlated to deforestation in most parts of the species‚Äô range, all the way from the northern limits in Mexico down to the southern limits in Argentina.Delgado, O. (2007). The soya route in North West Argentina. The United Soy Republics: the truth about soy in South America, 132-159.Bierregaard, R. O. (1995). The biology and conservation status of Central and South American Falconiformes: a survey of current knowledge. Bird Conservation International, 5(2-3), 325-340. Even where lands become protected, it is in many cases too late due to forest fragmentation prior to conservation, resulting in stands too fragmented to support extensive use by the ornate hawk-eagles. Canopy coverage of the forest must be at least 80% in order to retain this hawk-eagle, per a study of its habitat ranging in Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve, Mexico.De Labra, M. A., Escalante, P., & Monterrubio-Rico, T. (2013). Diurnal raptors in Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve, Mexico: current presence and relative abundance. Journal of Raptor Research, 47(4), 392-400. Beyond deforestation, human hunting is also causing declines of this species. In part this is due to competition for resources. For example, studies in Tikal, Guatemala showed that 49.4% of the biomass at ornate hawk-eagle nests was overlapping with the wild animals most extensively hunted by local humans (i.e. cracids, agoutis, squirrels). Also, where domestic chickens are found, they are opportunistically hunted by ornate hawk-eagle. Due to the causes of wild prey competition and predation of domestic fowl, humans frequently target and shot this and other eagles on sight, even without direct provocation.Thiollay, J. M. (1994).

Little overarching conservation efforts are known to have been implemented specifically pertaining to this species‚Äô declines, beyond the general retention and conservation of existing forests.Thiollay, J. M. (1989). Area requirements for the conservation of rain forest raptors and game birds in French Guiana.

They include both large (up to 2 meters long) carnivorous and even larger (to 3 meters) herbivorous forms, some semi-aquatic and others fully terrestrial. The Diadectomorpha seem to have evolved during late Mississippian times, although they only became common after the Carboniferous rainforest collapse and flourished during the Late Pennsylvanian and Early Permian periods. ==Anatomy== Life restoration of Limnoscelis Diadectomorphs possess both amphibian and reptilian characteristics. Originally these animals were included under the order Cotylosauria, and were considered the most primitive and ancestral lineage of reptiles. More recently they have been reclassified as amphibian-grade tetrapods, closely related to the first true amniotes (though they have also been argued to be amniotes more closely related to synapsids than to sauropsids). Contrary to other Reptiliomorph amphibians, the teeth of the Diadectomorpha lacked the infolding of the dentine and enamel that account for the name Labyrinthodontia for the non-amniote tetrapods.M√ºller, J. & Reisz, R.R. (2005): An early captorhinid reptile (Amniota: Eureptilia) from the Upper Carboniferous of Hamilton, Kansas. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, no 23: pp 561-568 ==Classification== Diadectomorpha is most commonly given the rank of order when formal taxonomic ranks are applied. It is further divided into three families, representing specialization into different ecological niches. The exact phylogenetic relationship between the three is disputed. * Family Diadectidae is perhaps the best known group, comprising medium to large herbivores. Early members were low-slung, but the latter Diadectes (from which the whole group take its name) evolved strong, if sprawling legs, paralleling the anatomy of early herbovorious reptiles. The teeth were chisel-like and lacked the typical labyrinthodont infolding of the enamel. The Diadectidae were distributed over most of the Northern parts of Pangaea. * Family Limnoscelidae contained large carnivores or piscivores. The largest genus, Limnoscelis could grow to at least 1.5 meters. The family had pointed and slightly curved teeth with labyrinthodont enamel. Distribution seem to have been restricted to the North America. * Family Tseajaiidae known from a single specimen from North America, were medium-sized, generalized reptiliomorph amphibians. They had blunt teeth and appear to be primarily herbivorous or omnivorous. The known specimen would have been on the order of a meter (3 ft.) long.Time Traveler: In Search of Dinosaurs and Other Fossils from Montana to Mongolia by Michael Novacek ==Reproduction and the origin of Amniota== Life restoration of Diadectes The reproduction of the Diadectomorphs has been the matter of some debate.Benton, M. J. (2000), Vertebrate Paleontology, 2nd ed. Blackwell Science Ltd If their group lay within the Amniota as has at times been assumed, they would have laid an early version of the amniote egg. Current thinking favours the amniote egg being evolved in very small animals, like Westlothiana or Casineria, leaving the bulky Diadectomorphs just on the amphibian side of the divide.Laurin, M.

(1999): Out of the Swamps, How early vertebrates established a foothold‚Äîwith all 10 toes‚Äîon land, Science News Volume 155, No 21 This would indicate the large and bulky Diadectomorphs laid anamniote eggs (in water). However, no unambiguously diadectomorph tadpole is known. Whether this is due to an actual lack of tadpole stage or taphonomy (many diadectomorphs were upland creatures where tadpoles would have a poor probability of being fossilized) is uncertain. Alfred Romer indicated that the anamniote/amniote divide might not have been very sharp, leaving the question of the actual mode of reproduction of these large animals unanswered.Romer, A.S. & T.S. Parsons. 1977. The Vertebrate Body. 5th ed. Saunders, Philadelphia. (6th ed. 1985) Possible reproductive modes include full amphibian spawning with aquatic tadpoles, internal fertilization with or without ovoviviparity, aquatic eggs with direct development or some combination of these. The reproductive mode might also have varied within the group. Lee and Spencer (1997) argued diadectomorphs probably laid amniote eggs because their adaptations to feed on terrestrial plants rich on fiber mean they were adapted to a niche not seen in unambiguous 'amphibians', and would have required an early acquisition of terrestrial endosymbionts necessary for this diet that supposedly could not have happened if young diadectomorphs were aquatic larvae. ==References== * Benton, M.

It is closely related to Quercus buckleyi (Texas red oak), Quercus texana (Nuttall's red oak), and Quercus gravesii (Chisos red oak). ==Distribution== Shumard oak is native to the Atlantic coastal plain primarily from North Carolina to northern Florida and west to central Texas; it is also found north in the Mississippi River Valley to central Oklahoma, eastern Kansas, Missouri, southern Illinois, Indiana, western and southern Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. It is found locally north to southern Michigan, southern Pennsylvania, Maryland, western New York, and the extreme south of Ontario, Canada. ==Description== Leaves in summer Mature Shumard oaks typically reach heights of , trunk diameter is typically , and crown width typically reaches in width. Typical size varies according to region, with larger specimens occurring in the southern portions of its native range in the United States. Record Shumard oaks have been measured at up to tall, with crowns up to in width. Young specimens generally exhibit conic or ovate crowns, with the upper crown filling in as the tree reaches maturity. Trunks are relatively straight and vertical. Trunks may have deeply fluted buttresses near the ground. Shumard oak is typically found in lowland areas and is able to survive where the soils experience flooding for six weeks of the year. The young bark of the Shumard oak is light grey, very smooth, and very reflective. Shumard oak bark darkens and develops ridges and furrows as it ages. Occasionally, white splotches are seen on the bark. Shumard oak twigs terminate in a cluster of buds. The buds are lighter in color than the olive- green twigs. The young twig is highly reflective. The leaves are arranged alternately and are broadly obovate with 5‚Äì9 lobes, each of which is terminated by bristle-tipped teeth. The leaves mature to between in length. The surfaces are glabrous, except for the tufted vein axils. They are dark green on the top, while their bottoms are a slightly lighter shade of green. The leaves turn brown to red in the fall and sometimes have hues of yellow mixed in. Fall colors are relatively late; specimens in central Texas may be at their most red in early December, while Florida specimens may not color substantially until February. Maturing acorn Shumard oaks bear relatively large acorns, which typically reach up to in diameter. Acorns take between 1.5 and 3.0 years to fully mature and may go unnoticed during their early stages of development. ==Ecology== The acorns of the Shumard oak provide food for various songbirds, game birds such as wild turkey and quail, waterfowl, white- tailed deer, feral hogs, and various rodents such as squirrels. The leaves and twigs can also provide browse for white-tailed deer. Oak wilt can attack all red oaks, including the Shumard oak. Other diseases that attack Shumard oaks are various fungi that can grow on the leaves, powdery mildew, canker diseases, and shoestring root. ==Cultivation and uses== Shumard oak is valued for commercial use, as a shade tree, and as a food source for various birds and mammals. With the Shumard Oak's ability to tolerate and thrive in a wide range of soil types, it is cultivated at least as far north as Ottawa, Ontario and southern Quebec, and as far south as Lake Worth, Florida. It is tolerant of wide ranges of pH levels in soil. It is drought-resistant, and prefers partial to full sunlight. Shumard oaks begin to bear seeds at a minimum of 25 years of age, and the optimum age for seed development is 50. They are known to have reached at least 480 years of age. The roots are intolerant to disturbance, so the tree should be planted in its permanent position at an early age. Shumard oak lumber is grouped with other red oak lumber for use in flooring, furniture, interior trim, decorative molding, paneling, and cabinetry. The lumber of Shumard oak is considered \\"mechanically superior\\" to that of other red oaks. ==References== * shumardii Category:Trees of Ontario Category:Trees of the United States Category:Plants described in 1861 ","title":"Quercus shumardii"},{"id":"2230728","text":"There were three police forces in the Third Reich under the Chef der Deutschen Polizei und Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler: *Ordnungspolizei (orpo) \\"regular police\\" *Sicherheitspolizei (Sipo) \\"security police\\" *Sicherheitsdienst (SD) \\"security service\\" In 1939 the Sipo and SD were combined to form the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA). ==Leadership== The leadership of the German police was formally vested in the Ministry of Interior, under Wilhelm Frick, minister of the interior 1933-1943 (when he was replaced by Heinrich Himmler). Already before the Nazi Macht√ºbernahme, Himmler was chief of the SS and the SD. In 1936 he became secretary of state of the interior, as well as chief of the German police. As Germany's most senior policeman, Himmler had two goals; first the official goal of centralization and Gleichschaltung: reforming the German police forces after Nazi ideals and Prussian models; secondly, the unofficial goal of making the German police an adjunct of the SS, thereby improving his standing among Hitler's vassals.

As a member of the Conservative Party, he governed in the early years of the era to be known as the Thirty Five Years of Conservatism in Nicaragua's political history. Cuadra's family had roots in Nicaragua since the days of the conquistadors. The Cuadra family's wealth and power came from interests in banking, agriculture, and mining. During most of his lifetime, Vicente Cuadra was one of the richest landowners in the country. == The presidency == Vicente Cuadra was elected by a landslide but was reluctant to serve due to poor health. However, he decided to serve in the best interests of the country after the Congress gave him an overwhelming vote of confidence and a mandate. His presidency was a reflection of his character ‚Äì ethical, frugal, and visionary. The Cuadra administration instituted a system of checks and balances in the executive branch, re-established the credit worthiness of the country, replenished the treasury, and positioned the war ravaged nation for much needed infrastructure improvements and projects which occurred during his successor's (Pedro Joaquin Chamorro) term. Educational, judicial, and scientific reforms were also implemented. Critics thought Cuadra as stingy and rigid. The biggest failure of his administration was the inability to deal with the Miskito tribal nation in the eastern region of Nicaragua. == Elder statesman == Vicente Cuadra really didn't enjoy being in the front lines of politics. His brother, Jose Joaquin, was better suited for that. Vicente, himself, preferred working behind the scenes like he did when he helped draft the Constitution of 1858. When his term of office was over, Cuadra retired to spending time with his family, overseeing his businesses, and writing. He didn't get much involved in the politics of the country and would rarely offer the opinion of a statesman unless it was warranted. The irony is that in 1891, Gen. Jos√© Santos Zelaya of the Liberal Party, taking advantage of splits within the Conservative party, began an economic and political campaign to ruin all of the Conservatives in the country, targeting the icons such as Vicente Cuadra. The former president's businesses were wiped out, most of his lands were confiscated, and his writings were burned. The final insult was that the 79-year-old Cuadra was imprisoned for a few weeks. == Legacy == Cuadra is one of the least known of Nicaragua's presidents due to: # His writings burned in the destruction of his hometown of Granada in 1856 by the forces of William Walker and again in 1891 by Zelaya confederates. # The destruction of government's archives in the Managua earthquake of 1931 # The Cuadra family, especially his son/secretary Vicente Cuadra Gomez, hesitancy to say or write anything about the former president because of \\"being eyewitness to Zelaya's cruelty and evil\\"; the family mantra for a couple of generations was no political involvement. Since 1854, approximately forty individuals have served as the President of Nicaragua. Among a select few, Vicente Cuadra is considered a model president in Nicaragua's presidential history. He has the reputation of being an honest president and a respected statesman. == Death == The former president died in the early morning of December 10, 1894, in his hometown of Granada surrounded by family and friends (He had outlived most of his contemporaries). The cause of death was old age/natural causes but everyone present felt it was due to various ailments brought on by his imprisonment. His funeral/burial was filled with honors and attended by a who's who of Nicaraguans except for one ‚Äì Zelaya. File:Vicente's Last Rest.jpg == Direct descendants == Vicente Cuadra Lugo with his wife procreated seven children; he had two other children with a mistress for a total of nine children. Thirty four grandchildren were procreated and over a hundred great-grandchildren. The family tree has been very fruitful and abundant with its main branches in Nicaragua and the United States. As with any family, there are many stories, myths, and legends, along with its share of saints and sinners but the touchstone is El Presidente Vicente Cuadra. Other family relations such as a former first lady of Nicaragua, the late Lila T Abaunza and Pablo Alberto Cuadra Arguello (poet, theologian) are part of the larger Cuadra family tree as is the late president. == Sources == * Revista Conservadora del Pensamiento Centroamericano Vol XVII, Genealogia de la Familia Quadra, Agosto 1967 * Nicaragua's Conservative Republic 1858-93.

His brothers were Dionisio Chamorro Alfaro and Fernando Chamorro Alfaro. Dionisio was married to Mercedes Oreamuno ... and had two sons, Salvador Chamorro Oreamuno and Rosendo Chamorro Oreamuno, President of Nicaragua, the first of whom married Gregoria Vargas B√°ez and had Emiliano Chamorro Vargas, 55th and 59th President of Nicaragua. By Josefa Per√©z ... his father had a natural son, born before his marriage, Fruto Chamorro P√©rez, 30th and 31st President of Nicaragua. His great-grandfather was Spanish Nobleman Diego Chamorro de Sotomayor y Murga de Villavicencio, born in Seville, who married no less than five times: to his great-grandmother Gregoria Lacayo de Briones y Pomar, In√©s de Villa-Nueva y ..., Juana Fajardo y ..., Gertrudis de Pasos y ... and Rafaela Occonor y Salafranca, by whom he had a daughter Josefa Chamorro Occonor (1784 - 1843). ==Career== At an early age, he left off studies to dedicate himself, together with his brother Dionisio, to the management of paternal inheritances under the guidance of their half-brother Fruto Chamorro. His first marriage was to N. Guadamuz; his second marriage was in 1854 with Mar√≠a de la Luz Bola√±os Benda√±a, born in 1828. They had three children: * Filadelfo Chamorro Bola√±os, married to Bertha Benard Vivas, and had: ** Julio Chamorro Benard, married to Dolores \\"Lola\\" Coronel Urtecho, daughter of Manuel Coronel Matus and wife Blanca Urtecho Avil√©s and sister of Jos√© Coronel Urtecho, and had: *** Edgar Chamorro Coronel, Chief of the Contras *** Other six sons and four daughters * Diego Manuel Chamorro Bola√±os, 56th President of Nicaragua * Pedro Joaquin Chamorro Bola√±os, married to his cousin Ana Mar√≠a Zelaya Bola√±os, and had: ** Pedro Joaqu√≠n Chamorro Zelaya, married to Margarita Cardenal Arg√ºello, daughter of Julio Cardenal Arg√ºello and wife and cousin Adela Arg√ºello Cervantes and maternal granddaughter of Jos√© Mar√≠a Arg√ºello Pe√±alba and wife Mar√≠a Cervantes Montalv√°n, and had: *** Pedro Joaqu√≠n Chamorro Cardenal *** Ana Mar√≠a Chamorro Cardenal, married to Carlos Holmann Thompson, and had: **** Eduardo Holmann Chamorro **** Ver√≥nica Holmann Chamorro **** Hugo Holmann Chamorro **** Ana Carolina Holmann Chamorro **** Bruno Holmann Chamorro **** Ericka Holmann Chamorro **** Juan Lorenzo Holmann Chamorro *** Ligia Chamorro y Cardenal ****Ximena Barreto ****Samuel Barreto ****Leonardo Barreto ****Juan Diego Barreto ****Dominica Barreto ****Paola Barreto *** Jaime Chamorro y Cardenal *** Xavier Chamorro Cardenal In 1849 Pedro Joaqu√≠n Chamorro became mayor of Granada and in 1854, he participated in the defense of the city, besieged by M√°ximo Jerez. He also contributed to the struggle to expel William Walker, the American filibuster. In 1862 he dedicated himself to politics as Senator of the Department of Granada. In 1869, he became a member of the governing junta of Nicaragua. He was elected president in 1871 for four years, and again joined the ruling junta in 1885. In both his public and private life, Don Pedro was considered progressive by some and an opportunist by many others, when conservative forces would keep \\"campesinos\\" without access to education,. He represented a faction of the Granada oligarchy and maintained strong conservative principles, which in Latin America meant the preservation of a feudal economic system, with an emphasis on trade. His influence would help form Nicaragua as a nation with the limitations of keeping the country and its economic resources under the control of a few families including the Chamorro and the few other families that still control Nicaragua economically today. He remained a political force in Nicaragua until his death on 7 June 1890. ==References== * Recorrido Historico de las Principales Figuras de la Familia Chamorro, Emilio Alvarez Lejarza, Revista Consevadora del Pensamiento Centroamericano, Vol. XIX - No. 91 (Abril, 1968) * Revisando la Historia de Nicaragua - 2004 Category:1818 births Category:1890 deaths Category:Presidents of Nicaragua Pedro Joaquin Chamorro y Alfaro Category:Conservative Party (Nicaragua) politicians Category:19th-century Nicaraguan people ","title":"Pedro Joaqu√≠n Chamorro Alfaro"},{"id":"2230746","text":"Joaqu√≠n Zavala Sol√≠s (30 November 1835 in Managua ‚Äì 30 December 1906 in Managua) was the President of Nicaragua from 1 March 1879 to 1 March 1883 and from 16 July to 15 September 1893.

At the age of 16, Rachtman auditioned to sing in the band the Angry Samoans, and the next year he was in a band called the Fairlanes. In the late 1980s, Rachtman was lead vocalist of the L.A. metal act Virgin. In the 1990s, he spent over a year in a band called Battery Club, which toured with The Offspring. Rachtman appears in Attack of Life: The Bang Tango Movie, which is a 2016 documentary film directed by Drew Fortier about 80s LA hard rock band Bang Tango. ===Hosting=== Before becoming a full-time VJ for Headbangers Ball, Rachtman made guest appearances as a fill-in and guest VJ for the show in 1989 while Adam Curry was still the main host for the program at that time. From 1990-1995, Rachtman hosted MTV's heavy metal show Headbangers Ball (replacing Curry) as a full-time VJ. His friend at the time, Axl Rose of Guns N' Roses, reportedly was instrumental in him getting the job at MTV. Despite having no TV experience during that time, he eventually got a job as a VJ on MTV after his successful performance during his audition at MTV studios in New York. Rachtman had a brief appearance as a wedding guest in Guns N' Roses' music video \\"November Rain\\". From August 1993 to January 1996, Riki co-hosted the radio advice program Loveline with Doctor Drew Pinsky and Adam Carolla. The trio hosted together until friction between Riki and Adam led Riki to leave the show in January 1996. In 1999 and 2000, Rachtman worked for World Championship Wrestling as a backstage interviewer. During one episode, he was almost powerbombed by wrestler Kevin Nash. He also hosted Nitro, WCW's flagship program, parties across the country. Rachtman had previously appeared on WCW programming as a guest co-host for the May 30, 1992 edition of Saturday Night. On the Los Angeles radio station KLSX, Rachtman hosted a show called 'Riki Rachtman Radio.' The show came to an abrupt end when he assaulted fellow KLSX show host Doug Steckler after Steckler insulted Rachtman's girlfriend at the time, adult-film actress Janine Lindemulder. In 2003, Rachtman hosted 22 Greatest Bands for MTV2. In 2003, he became the host of a syndicated rock music and NASCAR-themed radio show called Racing Rocks, which is heard on over 120 stations across America. He hosted Nascar 24/7 Live. He was a former co-host of the show NASCAR RaceDay, as of 2008 is no longer part of the program. ===Entrepreneurship=== Rachtman was the owner of The Cathouse nightclub, for many years a showcase for many of the heavy metal bands that were featured on Headbangers Ball. During this time, he also ran another nightclub called the Bordello. Rachtman and the Cathouse club are featured in the Penelope Spheeris documentary, The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years. During their heyday, they were also featured in Rolling Stone and Newsweek magazines. Rachtman also owns a skateboard company called Pool School. In the Summer of 2015, Rachtman became an ordained minister and performed his first marriage ceremony on August 15, 2015 at the Cathouse Live Concert at Irvine Meadows officiating the ceremony of Skye Hazard and Sean Kelehan of Omaha, Nebraska. ===VH1=== Rachtman Co- hosted the 2007 reunion show for Rock of Love, which starred his friend, Poison frontman Bret Michaels. Rachtman was also a dean on Rock of Love: Charm School, which featured Sharon Osbourne as headmistress and contestants from Rock of Love seasons 1 and 2, and he also hosted its reunion special, as well. In 2008, he hosted the reunion special for Rock of Love 2. In 2009, he again hosted the reunion special for Rock of Love Bus. He was last seen on Daisy of Love, a Rock of Love spin-off starring Daisy De La Hoya, Rachtman's friend and Rock of Love 2 runner-up. ==Personal life== In 1999, he lived in Orange County, California. In 1994, Riki told Chris Cornell on a Soundgarden episode of The Headbanger's Ball that he used to live in New Zealand. In 2018, Rachtman tweeted that he had been drug and alcohol free for 30 years. In November 2014, he announced on his Facebook account that he would be moving to Charlotte, North Carolina. Every year Rachtman raises money and goes on a motorcycle ride throughout North America. It is called Riki's Ride, and so far has raised close to $50,000 for various charities. Riki is dating Lea Vendetta from the television show Inkmaster. Together they live in Mooresville, North Carolina. ==Notes * *Racing Rocks with Riki Rachtman *lovelinecentral.com Category:Living people Category:American radio personalities Category:Professional wrestling announcers Category:VJs (media personalities) Category:People from Van Nuys, Los Angeles Category:People from Orange County, California Category:1965 births ","title":"Riki Rachtman"},{"id":"2230775","text":"Ignacio Ch√°vez may refer to: *Ignacio Ch√°vez (President of Nicaragua), President of Nicaragua in 1891 *Ignacio Ch√°vez S√°nchez (1897‚Äì1979), Mexican physician, founding member of the Colegio Nacional ","title":"Ignacio Ch√°vez"},{"id":"2230778","text":"Supersonic fractures are fractures where the fracture propagation velocity is higher than the speed of sound in the material.

Buehler and Huajian Gao) and IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose, California (Farid F. Abraham).Supersonic Fracture. MIT.edu. Accessed May 19, 2012. The issues of intersonic and supersonic fracture become the frontier of dynamic fracture mechanics. The work of Burridge initiated the exploration for intersonic crack growth (when the crack tip velocity V is between the shear in wave speed C^8 and the longitudinal wave speed C^1.Brittle fracture mechanism. Eurekalert.org. Accessed May 19, 2012. Supersonic fracture was a phenomenon totally unexplained by the classical theories of fracture. Molecular dynamics simulations by the group around Abraham and Gao have shown the existence of intersonic mode I and supersonic mode II cracks. This motivated a continuum mechanics analysis of supersonic mode III cracks by Yang. Recent progress in the theoretical understanding of hyperelasticity in dynamic fracture has shown that supersonic crack propagation can only be understood by introducing a new length scale, called œá; which governs the process of energy transport near a crack tip. The crack dynamics is completely dominated by material properties inside a zone surrounding the crack tip with characteristic size equal to œá. When the material inside this characteristic zone is stiffened due to hyperelastic properties, cracks propagate faster than the longitudinal wave speed. The research group of Gao has used this concept to simulate the Broberg problem of crack propagation inside a stiff strip embedded in a soft elastic matrix. These simulations confirmed the existence of an energy characteristic length. This study also had implications for dynamic crack propagation in composite materials. If the characteristic size of the composite microstructure is larger than the energy characteristic length, œá; models that homogenize the materials into an effective continuum would be in significant error. The challenge arises of designing experiments and interpretative simulations to verify the energy characteristic length. Confirmation of the concept must be sought in the comparison of experiments on supersonic cracks and the predictions of the simulations and analysis. While much excitement rightly centres on the relatively new activity related to intersonic cracking, an old but interesting possibility remains to be incorporated in the modern work: for an interface between elastically dissimilar materials, crack propagation that is subsonic but exceeds the Rayleigh wave speed has been predicted for at least some combinations of the elastic properties of the two materials. ==See also== *Characteristic energy length scale ==References== Category:Fracture mechanics ","title":"Supersonic fracture"},{"id":"2230780","text":"Jos√© Madriz Rodr√≠guez (21 July 1867 ‚Äì 14 May 1911) was the President of Nicaragua from 21 December 1909 to 20 August 1910.

Dissorophids were a group of fully terrestrial, often heavily armored faunivores. This, along with their relatively large size and geographical range suggest that they were able to coexist with amniotes as predators during the early Permian. Dissorophidae has four distinct clades differentiated largely on the morphology of the osteoderms, the Eucacopinae (previously Cacopinae), the Dissorophinae, the Aspidosaurinae, and the Platyhystricinae. Cacops is one of the few olsoniforms (dissorophids and the larger trematopids) whose ontogeny is beginning to surface. Cacops fossils were almost exclusively known from the Cacops Bone Bed of the Lower Permian Arroyo Formation of Texas for much of the 20th century. New material collected from the Dolese Brothers Quarry, near Richards Spur, Oklahoma in the past few decades has been recovered, painting a clearer picture of what the animal looked and acted like. ==History of discovery== C. woehri holotype Cacops aspidephorus is the most famous dissorophid, in part due to a majority of its skeleton having been known for over a century. Over 50 specimens have been found in the Cacops Bone Bed in Baylor County, Texas, which is now flooded by the dammed Lake Kemp. However, many of the specimens are covered in calcite, which penetrates the bone tissue, resulting in poor preservation. \\"Trematopsis seltini\\" from the Vale Formation of Texas was originally described as a trematopid by Olson (1956) but was later synonymized with Cacops aspidephorus by Milner (1985). Cacops morrisi is named in honor of Tony Morris, who discovered one of its two specimens. Many specimens have been found in the Dolese Brothers Limestone Quarry, near Richards Spur, Oklahoma. Cacops morrisi has a skull that differs from C. aspidephorus in having a snout that is slightly longer than its post-orbital region, a shorter distance between the orbit and the temporal emargination, and uncinate processes of the ribs. Cacops woehri is named in honor of Daniel Woehr, who is an amateur collector of fossils. Specimens have been found in the Dolese Brothers Limestone Quarry, near Richards Spur, Oklahoma. Cacops woehri differs from C. aspidephorus and C. morrisi in many attributes, including a more shallow skull, more dorsally located orbits, and a narrow opening of its tympanic embayment. The contribution of the postparietals to the skull roof also appears to be shorter in C. woehri than in C. morrisi, while the occipital flanges are proportionately larger in C. woehri. More notable differences distinguishable from C. morrisi include: absence of lateral exposure of ectopterygoid in juveniles, absence of tusk-like teeth on the anterior margin of the interpterygoid vacuities, and the quadratojugal lacking an anterior process. The teeth of C. woehri are also not recurved as in C. aspidephorus and C. morrisi, showing instead a distinct lingual curvature. Because of the different skull shape, it is theorized that this specific taxon may have had a different ecology than its sister taxa, possibly with a different prey spectrum. This suggests that there could have been different functional demands for the dissorophoids found at the Oklahoma locality. ==Description== Restoration of C. aspidephorus American paleontologist Samuel W. Williston used the details of the species Cacops aspidephorus to first describe its features. He noted: \\"The creature as mounted presents an almost absurd appearance, with its large head and pectoral region, absence of neck, and short tail\\" (pg. 279), reflected in the name Cacops (from Greek kakos \\"bad, ugly\\" and ops \\"face, look\\"). However, because of the poor preservation of specimens collected from the Cacops Bone Bed in Texas, other researchers who collected specimens from other localities have described many of Cacops‚Äô features with more certainty. Features that distinguish Cacops from other dissorophids include a large dorsal process of the quadrate and a shortened posterior skull. The skull is very box-like and its cheeks aligned almost at a right angle to the skull table. The external cranial ornamentation is noticeable on the skull table and on top of the ridges that border the numerous depressions. One significant ontogenetic change in Cacops is a more evenly distributed ornamentation in the adults. Like other dissorophids, the temporal region of Cacops‚Äô skull was dominated by the tympanic embayment, which likely housed a large tympanum. Marginal teeth are recurved and thinner than in other temnospondyls. Cacops has fewer, but larger, teeth than in most other dissorophids. The palatal dentition consists of recurved tusks larger than the marginal teeth and minute, strongly recurved teeth that cover most of the palatal surface. Cacops was a medium-sized dissorophid, being smaller than later dissorophids from Eurasia such as Kamacops. Like other dissorophids, Cacops had osteoderms associated with the vertebral column. Internal osteoderms are fused to the neural spines, while external osteoderms overlapped adjacent positions with a ventral flange that inserted between successive internal osteoderms. The osteoderms are associated with only the first 15 vertebrae, beginning at the axis. They are relatively narrow, especially posteriorly, and are subrectangular in dorsal profile, except for the first osteoderm which is more triangular. The osteoderms also have dermal pitting on their dorsal surfaces. The distributions of these pits are not random, but rather found along the raised edges of the midsagittal groove and often in the groove as well. ==Paleobiology Ontogeny === Partial growth series of both Cacops morrisi and Cacops woehri are known. Overall changes to the shape of the skull are minimal, indicating that the shallower skull of C. woehri is a valid feature for differentiating between the taxa throughout ontogeny. Of the two, the ontogeny of C. morrisi is better known due to more complete material. Ontogenetic changes in C. morrisi include the development of more rugose ornamentation and more even distribution of ornamentation across the skull, loss of a lateral exposure of the ectopterygoid (the 'LEE'), the posterior closure of the otic embayment, and a flatter posterior skull roof. In C. woehri, there are slight changes to a few elements (e.g., postorbital) and changes in proportions to the parasphenoid. Ornamentation does not change as drastically as in C. morrisi. ===Predation=== The skull of Cacops has several features associated with predatory behavior. In particular, transverse flanges on the pterygoid that extend below the level of the marginal tooth row have been interpreted to be adaptive for capturing and holding struggling prey; this feature is also seen in the trematopids. Like many other terrestrial tetrapods, Cacops exhibits evidence of a tympanic membrane in the form of a large, smooth, unornamented flange in the otic notch that bears faint striations inferred to have been the sites of attachment. Among modern amniotes, sensory perception requires a specialized middle ear that collects airborne sounds through a tympanic membrane and delivers the vibrations to the inner ear via multiple structures, including the stapes. Thus, the discovery of a slender stapes in Cacops aspidephorus suggested that Cacops had an ability to hear airborne sound. The presence of a tympanum in contemporary amniotes is a difference between these terrestrial vertebrates that suggests these two groups had very different abilities to hear airborne sound. ===Locomotion=== Skeletal restoration by Williston The locomotion of Cacops aspidephorus has been explored through two studies by David Dilkes. Two series of osteoderms of the presacral vertebral column affect the biomechanics of the axial skeleton. Cacops have an internal series, which consist of an osteoderm fused to the distal tips of each neural spine and an external series, which lie dorsal to and between the segments of the internal series. The portions of the vertebral column with osteoderms had limited lateral flexion, thus limiting lateral movement. The authors suggested that Cacops may have had the ability to move forward in short running spurts or that it may have also used a symmetrical walk similar to modern crocodilians or salamanders, in which its body is supported by opposite movements of the front and hind limbs. == References == Category:Dissorophids Category:Prehistoric amphibian genera Category:Cisuralian temnospondyls of North America Category:Permian geology of Oklahoma Category:Permian geology of Texas Category:Fossil taxa described in 1910 Category:Taxa named by Samuel Wendell Williston ","title":"Cacops"},{"id":"2230787","text":"Juan Jos√© Estrada Morales (1 January 1872 in Managua ‚Äì 11 July 1967 in Managua)Profile of Juan Jos√© Estradahttps://www.rulers.org/indexe.html was the President of Nicaragua from 29 August 1910 to 9 May 1911. ==Biography== Juan Jos√© Estrada Morales was a Nicaraguan military and political who acted as President of Nicaragua from August 29, 1910 to May 9, 1911.

He came from a humble family of handcrafters of liberal ideology that produced four military men, a colonel and three generals, who became outstanding in Nicaraguan military history. These were Jos√© Dolores Estrada Morales, Aurelio, Irineo and himself, who were known as Los Gracos in honor to the Roman Gracchi family. His three brothers were mayors of Managua: Irineo in 1899, Jos√© Dolores in 1901, and Aurelio in 1903. The last was Generalissimo in the victory of the Battle of Namasig√ºe in 1907.

Don Diego was elected President of Nicaragua in 1921, following his nephew Emiliano in that office. The elections faced significant interference from the United States, and was characterized by irregularities. His government faced hard times with questions of electoral fraud, and lack of legitimacy. During his presidency, he crushed an invasion by rebels from Honduras and initiated an agreement between himself and the presidents of Honduras and El Salvador to prevent such invasions in the future. He also signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship among the Central American countries.

It is one use of a deed poll. Some organisations, such as government departments issuing passports and driving licences, may not recognise a name change without a deed poll. However, an official document is not a legal requirement for a valid name change in common law.Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994 SI 1994/604 (as amended) ==Legal procedureUnited Kingdom=== In England and Wales, such a deed may be registered in the Central Office of the High Court. Deeds so registered are advertised in the London Gazette. A deed of name change on behalf of a minor must be approved by the Senior Master on behalf of the Master of the Rolls who will take into account the child's best interests. A deed poll can also be used to change a child's name, as long as everyone with parental responsibility for the child consents to it and the child does not object to it. Registration of deeds is regulated by the Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994, SI 1994/604 (as amended). Compared to some other European countries, for example Germany, a name change in the UK is easy and virtually unrestricted regarding choice. Registration of a deed of change of name is not a legal requirement in the United Kingdom. A standard legal document, with stock wording, filled in by the person making the deed poll, and signed in presence of a witness, carries sufficient legal authority to be recognised. The witness need not be a solicitor but can be anyone over the age of 18 independent of the person changing their name. The procedure, requirements and law surrounding the issue in Northern Ireland are similar to those in England and Wales. In England, Northern Ireland and Wales, a deed of change of name will not change the name on a birth certificate. For instance, when applying for a passport, both the certificate and the deed would need to be presented as documents of identity. In Northern Ireland, for children between the ages of two and eighteen years, only one change of forename(s) and one change of surname may be recorded. In Scotland, it is also possible to record a change of name on the original birth register entry at the General Register Office. However, only one change of forename and three changes of surname are permitted. This restriction does not apply to trans people who have a Gender Recognition Certificate, as a new entry in the Gender Recognition Register bearing one's new name and acquired gender is established by the General Register Office, and all subsequent birth certificates are issued from that Register. ===Republic of Ireland=== In the Republic of Ireland, a deed poll of change of name () is obtainable from the Central Office of the Four Courts, Dublin at a cost of ‚Ç¨30. Like in the UK, there are very few restrictions on name changes. One is that foreign nationals must also obtain a change of name license from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service. One of Ireland's most noted name changers was the politician Se√°n Loftus, who repeatedly added middle names referring to his political views so that they would appear on election ballot papers. ==History== In re Parrott, Cox v Parrott [1946] Ch 183,Re Parrott, Cox v Parrott [1946 Ch 183] Mr Justice Vaisey stated that he did not believe that a deed poll could be used to change a person's Christian name if given in a baptismal ceremony - that could be done by only an Act of Parliament. Deeds that change a person's first name can be registered by the applicant in the Enrolment Books of the Senior Courts of England and Wales, which is located within the Royal Courts of Justice on Strand, London, and they are usually endorsed \\"Notwithstanding the decision of Mr Justice Vaisey in re Parrott, Cox v Parrott, the applicant wishes the enrolment to proceed\\". ==References *UK Government - Change your name (by deed poll) Category:Human names Category:English law Category:Law in Northern Ireland Category:Scots law ","title":"Deed of change of name"},{"id":"2230819","text":"Adolfo D√≠az Recinos (15 July 1875 in Alajuela, Costa Rica ‚Äì 29 January 1964 in San Jos√©, Costa Rica) was served as the President of Nicaragua between 9 May 1911 and 1 January 1917 and again between 14 November 1926 and 1 January 1929. Born in Costa Rica to Nicaraguan parents in 1875, he worked as a secretary for the La Luz y Los Angeles Mining Company, an American company chartered in Delaware that owned the large gold mines around Siuna in eastern Nicaragua. In this capacity, he helped channel funds to the revolt against Liberal President Jos√© Santos Zelaya, who had incurred the anger of the United States by negotiating with Germany and Japan to resurrect the proposed Nicaragua Canal. D√≠az became Vice President of Nicaragua in 1910.History of Vicepresidency After he became president in 1911, D√≠az was forced to rely on U.S. Marines to put down a Liberal revolt, which resulted in a contingent of Marines remaining in Nicaragua for over a decade. In return, in 1914, he signed the Bryan‚ÄìChamorro Treaty, which granted the United States exclusive rights to build an inter-oceanic canal across Nicaragua. After his term as president ended, D√≠az briefly lived in the United States. However, he returned to the presidency in 1926, after a coup by General Emiliano Chamorro (following the withdrawal of the Marines) failed to win U.S. support. During his second term as president, another Liberal revolt occurred. The Liberal forces were on the verge of seizing Managua when the U.S. forced the warring parties to accept a power-sharing agreement, the Espino Negro accord. One Liberal commander, Augusto Sandino, rejected the agreement and waged a guerrilla war against the U.S. Marines, who remained in the country to prop up D√≠az's government and enforce the Espino Negro accord. In 1928, after elections supervised by the Marines, D√≠az was replaced as president by former Liberal General Jos√© Maria Moncada. Afterwards, he acquired control of several of Nicaragua's gold mines, which had been destroyed during raids by Sandino's forces. He unsuccessfully tried to restore mining operations for the La Luz Company, until they sold their holdings to the Nevada-based Tonopah Mining Company. In 1936, after Anastasio Somoza Garc√≠a seized power, D√≠az took up permanent residency in the United States. He lived in the U.S. for more than a decade, primarily in New York City but also in Miami and New Orleans, before moving to Costa Rica, where he died in 1964. ==References External links == *Adolfo D√≠az papers, Tulane University/Latin American Library Category:1875 births Category:1964 deaths Category:People from Alajuela Category:Presidents of Nicaragua Category:Nicaraguan expatriates in the United States Category:People of the Banana Wars Category:Vice Presidents of Nicaragua Category:Conservative Party (Nicaragua) politicians ","title":"Adolfo D√≠az"},{"id":"2230820","text":"Sebasti√°n Uriza Vega (1861 ‚Äì after 1927) was a Nicaraguan politician and senator from Granada who was the President of Nicaragua from 30 October to 11 November 1926.

Further American intervention led to the deployment of US troops in Nicaragua from 1909-1933, with a brief exception during 1925 that set the stage for the Nicaraguan Civil War. === Actions before and after the Nicaraguan Constitutional War (1926-1927) === The U.S. Marines withdrew their forces from Nicaragua in 1925, prompting General Emiliano Chamorro to rise ‚Äúin rebellion against a new regime‚Äù.

By 1928, US Secretary of State Henry Stimson had become involved in the conflict. The American public was growing weary of the presence of US Marines in Nicaragua and the US government was looking for ways to quickly withdraw its forces.

Moncada was the president of the upper chamber of National Congress of Nicaragua 1942-1943. == Descendants == General, then President Moncada's first marriage was to Ms. Margarita Carranza, their children being Elsa, Aquiles, Elio, Hernaldo, Lesbia and Alba Moncada Carranza. One the latter's grand-daughters, Maria Elena Amador Valerio, married Guillermo F. P√©rez-Arg√ºello, the oldest great-grand son of Do√±a Ang√©lica Balladares de Arg√ºello (1872-1973), who was Pres. Moncada's close friend, comrade and one of his most assiduous political allies in the 1920s and 30s and until his death. It was during his triumphant entrance to Granada, in June of 1927, that the then General Moncada demanded she be accorded the appellation of \\"Liberal Heroine\\" as a result of what he termed \\"her colossal struggles during the Nicaraguan Constitutional War\\". From an historical perspective, and as this was reported in various newspapers, most notably in the front page of the Diario Moderno's June 14, 1927 edition, it was thus as of that date, which continued up to her own death at the age of 101, that she, a descendant of the Western Hemisphere's branch of the House of Plantagenet and its most celebrated Nicaraguan female member, became known as the \\"1st Lady of Liberalism\\" . From his second marriage to Ms. Josefa Reyes Gadea, his children were Leda Maria, Omar and the late √ìscar Moncada Reyes, who served as President of the National Assembly of Nicaragua from 1999 until 2001. ==References * *Encyclop√¶dia Britannica online ‚Äì Jos√© Mar√≠a Moncada (president of Nicaragua) *Biografia de Jos√© Mar√≠a Moncada (Spanish) == Selected works == *Moncada, J.

He was the eldest son of Roberto Sacasa and √Ångela Sacasa Cuadra, the former's cousin twice removed. He was a relative of Benjam√≠n Sacasa. Born in the town of Le√≥n, Sacasa studied in the United States from 1889 to 1901, earning an M.D. from Columbia University.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/515180/Juan-Bautista- Sacasa He served as a professor and dean of faculty at the National University in Le√≥n, and was a supporter of the Liberal regime of Jos√© Santos Zelaya. In 1924, Sacasa became a member of a political coalition headed by moderate Conservative Carlos Sol√≥rzano. Shortly afterwards, the detachment of U.S. Marines which had remained in Nicaragua for thirteen years withdrew, believing that the political situation was stable. In October 1925, Sol√≥rzano's government was overthrown by former President General Emiliano Chamorro, who failed to gain U.S. recognition and subsequently resigned in favor of Adolfo D√≠az. In the meantime, Sacasa fled to Mexico. Following an uprising by Liberal soldiers in Puerto Cabezas, Sacasa returned to Nicaragua in 1926. Asserting his claim as constitutional president, he established a government in Puerto Cabezas. Supplied by Mexico with arms and munitions, the Liberal rebels, under the command of General Jos√© Mar√≠a Moncada, nearly succeeded in capturing Managua. However, the U.S. forced the two warring parties to enter into negotiations, resulting in the Pact of Espino Negro, which required that both sides would disarm and D√≠az would be allowed to finish his term.http://countrystudies.us/nicaragua/10.htm Sacasa reluctantly agreed to accept the agreement and withdraw his claim to the presidency, but refused to sign the pact and left the country; leaving Moncada to sign the pact on Sacasa's behalf.http://www.sandinorebellion.com/Top100pgs/Top100-p2a.html Over the next six years, a formerly obscure Liberal general named Augusto Sandino would lead a guerilla war against the Marines, who had remained in the country to enforce the agreement. In 1932, Sacasa was elected President. He took office on January 1, 1933, the day before the scheduled departure of the Marines. At the insistence of the U.S. Ambassador, he named Anastasio Somoza Garc√≠a, who was married to one of his nieces, as director of the Guardia Nacional (National Guard). The following month, Sacasa met with Sandino, during which Sandino pledged his loyalty to the new government in exchange for amnesty and land for his followers. Sandino continued to call for the disbanding of the National Guard and, in February 1934, he was assassinated under orders from Somoza. Despite Sacasa's disapproval, he proved unable to contain the growing power of Somoza and the National Guard. His popularity continued to diminish as Nicaragua's fragile economy suffered the collapse of coffee prices due to the Great Depression and allegations of widespread fraud surfaced in the 1934 congressional elections. Meanwhile, Somoza's power continued to grow, and he cultivated ties with former presidents Moncada and Chamorro. Early in 1936, Somoza used the National Guard to purge local officials loyal to the president and replace them with his associates. On June 9, he forced Sacasa to resign, appointing a series of puppet presidents before assuming the presidency himself the following year. Afterwards, Sacasa fled into exile in the U.S., living in Los Angeles until his death ten years later. He married Mar√≠a Arg√ºello Manning, a cousin of Leonardo Arg√ºello, 66th President of Nicaragua; together, they had the following children: *Maruca Sacasa Arg√ºello *Carlos Sacasa Arguello *Roberto Sacasa Arguello *Gloria Sacasa Arguello Juan Bautista Sacaza was the first cousin of Bertha Lacayo Sacaza. Bertha Lacayo Sacasa was married to Lisimaco Lacayo Solorzano and they had only one child Will Lacayo Lacayo. Will Lacayo Lacayo had four children Danilo Lacayo, Bertha Lacayo, Ligia Lacayo and Tania Lacayo. ==References== Category:1874 births Category:1946 deaths Category:People from Le√≥n, Nicaragua Category:Nicaraguan people of Spanish descent Category:Liberal Party (Nicaragua) politicians Category:Presidents of Nicaragua Category:Vice Presidents of Nicaragua Category:Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons alumni Category:People of the Banana Wars ","title":"Juan Bautista Sacasa"},{"id":"2230825","text":"Carlos Alberto Brenes Jarqu√≠n (2 December 1884 in Masaya - 2 January 1942 in Managua) was the President of Nicaragua from 9 June 1936 to 1 January 1937.

It is characterized by atrophy in the frontal lobe and temporal lobe of the brain, with sparing of the parietal and occipital lobes. Common proteinopathies that are found in FTLD include the accumulation of tau proteins and TARDBPs. Mutations in the C9orf72 gene have been established as a major genetic contribution of FTLD, although defects in the GRN and MAPT genes are also associated with it. == Classification == There are 3 main histological subtypes found at post-mortem: *FTLD-tau is characterised by tau positive inclusion bodies often referred to as Pick-bodies. Examples of FTLD-tau include; Pick's disease, corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy. *FTLD-TDP (or FTLD-U ) is characterised by ubiquitin and TDP-43 positive, tau negative, FUS negative inclusion bodies. The pathological histology of this subtype is so diverse it is subdivided into four subtypes based on the detailed histological findings: :*Type A presents with many small neurites and neuronal cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in the upper (superficial) cortical layers. Bar-like neuronal intranuclear inclusions can also be seen they are fewer in number. :*Type B presents with many neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions in both the upper (superficial) and lower (deep) cortical layers, and lower motor neurons. However neuronal intranuclear inclusions are rare or absent. This is often associated with ALS and C9ORF72 mutations (see next section). :*Type C presents many long neuritic profiles found in the superficial cortical laminae, very few or no neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, neuronal intranuclear inclusions or glial cytoplasmic inclusions. This is often associated with semantic dementia. :*Type D presents with many neuronal intranuclear inclusions and dystrophic neurites, and an unusual absence of inclusions in the granule cell layer of the hippocampus. Type 4 is associated with VCP mutations. Two physicians independently categorized the various forms of TDP-43 associated disorders. Both classifications were considered equally valid by the medical community, but the physicians in question have jointly proposed a compromise classification to avoid confusion. *FTLD-FUS; which is characterised by FUS positive cytoplasmic inclusions, intra nuclear inclusions, and neuritic threads. All of which are present in the cortex, medulla, hippocampus, and motor cells of the spinal cord and XIIth cranial nerve. Dementia lacking distinctive histology (DLDH) is a rare and controversial entity. New analyses have allowed many cases previously described as DLDH to be reclassified into one of the positively defined subgroups. ==Genetics== There have been numerous advances in descriptions of genetic causes of FTLD, and the related disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. *Mutations in the Tau gene (known as MAPT or Microtubule Associated Protein Tau) can cause a FTLD presenting with tau pathology (FTLD-tau). There are over 40 known mutations at present. *Mutations in the Progranulin gene (PGRN) can cause a FTLD presenting with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP43). Patients with Progranulin mutations have type 3 ubiquitin-positive, TDP-43 positive, tau- negative pathology at post-mortem. Progranulin is associated with tumorgenesis when overproduced, however the mutations seen in FTLD-TDP43 produce a haploinsufficiency, meaning that because one of the two alleles is damaged, only half as much Progranulin is produced. *Mutations in the CHMP2B gene are associated with a rare behavioural syndrome akin to bvFTLD (mainly in a large Jutland cohort), presenting with a tau negative, TDP-43 negative, FUS negative, Ubiquitin positive pathology. *Mutations in the VCP gene cause a TDP-43-positive FTLD which is associated with multisystem proteinopathy (MSP), also known as IBMPFD (inclusion body myopathy, Paget's disease and frontotemporal dementia) *Mutations in the TDP-43 gene (known as TARBP or TAR DNA-binding protein) are an exceptionally rare cause of FTLD, despite this protein being present in the pathological inclusions of many cases (FTLD- TDP43). However, mutations in TARBP are a more common cause of ALS, which can present with frontotemporal dementia. Since these instances are not considered a pure FTLD they are not included here. Mutations in all of the above genes cause a very small fraction of the FTLD spectrum. Most of the cases are sporadic (no known genetic cause). *A proportion of FTLD-TDP43 [with ALS] cases had shown genetic linkage to a region on chromosome 9 (FTLD-TDP43/Ch9). This linkage has recently been pinned down to the C9ORF72 gene. Two groups published identical findings back-to-back in the journal Neuron in mid-2011, showing that a hexanucleotide repeat expansion of the GGGGCC genetic sequence within an intron of this gene was responsible. This expansion was found to be present in a large proportion of familial and sporadic cases, particularly in the Finnish population ==Diagnosis== For diagnostic purposes, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ([18F]fluorodeoxyglucose) positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) are applied. They measure either atrophy or reductions in glucose utilization. The three clinical subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, frontotemporal dementia, semantic dementia and progressive nonfluent aphasia, are characterized by impairments in specific neural networks. The first subtype with behavioral deficits, frontotemporal dementia, mainly affects a frontomedian network discussed in the context of social cognition. Semantic dementia is mainly related to the inferior temporal poles and amygdalae; brain regions that have been discussed in the context of conceptual knowledge, semantic information processing, and social cognition, whereas progressive nonfluent aphasia affects the whole left frontotemporal network for phonological and syntactical processing. ==Society== United States Senator Pete Domenici (R-NM) was a known sufferer of FTLD, and the illness was the main reason behind his October 4, 2007 announcement of retirement at the end of his term. American film director, producer, and screenwriter Curtis Hanson died as a result of FTLD on September 20, 2016. ==See also== * Frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 ==ReferencesBibliography== *Cairns NJ, Bigio EH, Mackenzie IR, Neumann M, et al.

He was named Adam Clayton Powell Diago, as is the Spanish naming custom of using the mother's surname as part of his official name. Powell's maternal grandfather Gonzalo Diago was a mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico and served as such from 1941 to 1945.Municipios ‚Äì Acerca de San Juan When his parents separated, Powell's mother was granted custody, and he was raised and educated in Puerto Rico. In 1980, Powell moved to the mainland United States to study at Howard University in Washington, D.C.. He changed his surname by dropping his mother's surname \\"Diago\\". He then continued to use the name Adam Clayton Powell IV. This has caused confusion as his half-nephew, 8 years younger than he, was also named Adam Clayton Powell IV. He later earned a law degree from Fordham University in New York.Ebony ==Political career== Powell ran successfully for the New York City Council in 1991. In 1994, Powell challenged Representative Charles B. Rangel for his seat in the United States House of Representatives, but lost. In 1997, he ran for Manhattan borough president, but lost to C. Virginia Fields.Charlie Rangel‚Äôs Old-New Challenger. Steve Kornacki. October 16, 2009. New York Observer. Powell worked for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). In 2001, he participated and was arrested in the Vieques protests, which demanded the departure of the U.S. Navy from that island. When Rangel retired in 2016, Powell ran again for the House seat. He lost to state Senator Adriano Espaillat. ==Family life== Powell married Andrea Dial, a former Ebony fashion fair model. They had a son, Adam Clayton Powell V, before divorcing in the mid-1990s. ==ControversiesFundraising=== When Powell ran for Congress in 1994, he raised $64,000, 10% of which came from residents of his state, while the remainder were donated by contributors from Miami and New Jersey, including $5000 from Free Cuba PAC, Inc., headed by leading Cuban-exile community figure Jorge Mas Canosa who made a $1000 personal donation to Powell. ===Campaign funds=== Powell spent $1,200 of his campaign funds traveling to Ireland.http://solanaanderik.com/articles/AlbanyCampaignSpending.pdf Powell said he accompanied several lawmakers on the Ireland trip, which was sponsored by the New York American-Irish Legislators Society as a means to raise awareness of the issues that affect the Irish community. ===Vehicular charges=== In 2008, Powell was arrested and charged for allegedly driving while intoxicated (DWI) on the Henry Hudson Parkway in New York City. He was acquitted of driving while intoxicated and found guilty of the lesser charge of driving while impaired. This charge is considered a traffic violation rather than a criminal conviction.

Located at 59th Street and Fourth Avenue in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, it is served by the N and R trains at all times, as well as some W trains during rush hours. The 59th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line, which was approved in 1905. Construction on the segment of the line that includes 59th Street started on March 15, 1913, and was completed in 1915. The station opened on June 22, 1915, as the southernmost station of the initial portion of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1926-1927, and again during the 1960s. The 59th Street station is also being renovated between 2018 and 2020, and elevators are being added to make the station compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. == History  Construction === A Coney Island-bound N train leaving the station The 59th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line, the plan for which was initially adopted on June 1, 1905. The Rapid Transit Commission was succeeded on July 1, 1907, by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC), which approved the plan for the line in late 1907. As part of negotiations between New York City, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT), and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company for the expansion of the city's transit network, the line was leased to a subsidiary of the BRT. The agreement, known as Contract 4 of the Dual Contracts, was signed on March 19, 1913. In 1912, during the Dual System negotiations, the construction of an extension of the Fourth Avenue subway from 43rd Street to 89th Street, just south of the 86th Street station, was recommended. The proposal was approved by the Board of Estimate on February 15, 1912. The PSC directed its chief engineer to create plans on June 14, 1912. The two contracts for the extension, Route 11B, were awarded on September 16, 1912, to the Degnon Construction Company for a combined $3.8 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Construction on Route 11B1, the section of the extension between 43rd Street and 61st Street, which includes the 59th Street station, began on March 15, 1913. Originally, this section was planned to have two tracks, but after the connection to the Sea Beach Line was added to the plan during the middle of construction, the plan was changed to four tracks. This section was completed in 1915. 59th Street opened on June 22, 1915, as part of an extension of the subway to Coney Island, which included the segment of the Fourth Avenue Line to the north of the station, as well as the entire Sea Beach Line to the south. The station's opening was marked with a competition between two trains heading from Chambers Street station in Manhattan to the Coney Island station, one heading via the West End Line and the other via the Sea Beach Line; the latter got to Coney Island first. Since 59th Street was an express station, the platforms were originally long, allowing eight-car express trains to stop there. === Renovations === On June 27, 1922, the New York State Transit Commission directed its engineers to prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at 23 stations on the lines of the Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), the successor to the BRT, to accommodate eight-car trains. As part of the project, 59th Street's platforms would have been lengthened from to . Though the Transit Commission ordered the BMT to lengthen these platforms in September 1923, progress on the extensions did not occur until February 16, 1925, when the New York City Board of Transportation (NYCBOT) directed its engineers to prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at this and eleven other stations along the Fourth Avenue Line. It estimated the project's cost to be $633,000 (). The NYCBOT received bids for the project on February 25, 1926. The contract was awarded to the Corson Construction Company for $345,021 (). The extensions opened on August 1, 1927.  1960s  A view of the former tunnel wall at the north end of the station, where the platforms were extended in 1970 In the 1960s, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) started a project to lengthen station platforms on its lines in Southern Brooklyn to to accommodate 10-car trains. On July 14, 1967, the NYCTA awarded a contract to conduct test borings at eleven stations on the Fourth Avenue Line, including 59th Street, to the W. M. Walsh Corporation for $6,585 () in preparation of the construction of platform extensions. The NYCTA issued an invitation for bids on the project to extend the platforms at stations along the Fourth Avenue Line between 45th Street station and Bay Ridge‚Äì95th Street, including this station, on May 3, 1968. However, work had already started on the platform extension project in February. The platforms were extended by to the north.  2010s  Elevator access for this station has been proposed for the late 2010s. However, the installation of elevators has been delayed due to a column replacement project above this section of the Fourth Avenue Line. Both the column replacement and the elevator installation require temporary lane closures on Fourth Avenue, a major artery. An elevator contract was supposed to be awarded in November 2016, but was pushed back to July 2018. A $55.2 million contract for the installation of three elevators at the 59th Street station was awarded in late 2018, and substantial completion is expected in July 2020. ==Station layout== {table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=50G style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=150Street level style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=425Exit/entrance - style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"M style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"Mezzanine style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"Fare control, station agent - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" rowspan=6 valign=topB Platform level style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"Northbound local style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"‚Üê toward ( late nights) () ‚Üê toward late nights () ‚Üê toward (select weekday trips) () - style=\\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border- bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\\" colspan=2Island platform - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"Northbound express style=\\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"‚Üê toward () - Southbound express  toward () ‚Üí - style=\\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border- left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\\" colspan=2Island platform - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"Southbound local style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" toward () ‚Üí toward late nights () ‚Üí toward (select weekday trips) () ‚Üí } alt= This station is the southernmost four-track express station on the Fourth Avenue Line with two island platforms. South of the station, there are two diamond crossovers, allowing trains to cross between each pair of local and express tracks. The local tracks continue along Fourth Avenue to Bay Ridge‚Äì95th Street while the express tracks turn east and become the BMT Sea Beach Line. The N and R stop here at all times, while some rush-hour W trains stop here in the peak direction. The station walls have mosaic trim lines on top of the white tiles, and spell 59th Street at intervals. The northern sections of the station are where the platforms were extended in 1970, and they have no mosaic trims or tiles along the wall, instead including an extension of the tunnel benchwall. Two sets of columns run along the entire length of both platforms and are painted yellow. The mosaic trim lines are also present in the mezzanines. At the top of the pairs of staircases to each of the platforms, in the trim lines, there are directional mosaics. Those to the Brooklyn-bound platform say \\"UP TOWN TRAINS\\", while those to the Manhattan-bound platform say \\"DOWN TOWN TRAINS\\". ===Exits=== The street-level entrances are at the southern end of the station, with one entrance along either side of Fourth Avenue between 60th and 61st Streets. This part-time exit is unstaffed and has High Entry-Exit Turnstiles. There are also four exits to Fourth Avenue and 59th Street, with two each to either northern corner, at the north end of the station. Each entrance has its own small mezzanine, and allows for crossovers between platforms. ==Provisions for proposed extensions== The proposed Staten Island Tunnel would have branched off at 66th Street Immediately south of the station, there are tunnel stub headings running straight from the local tracks. They run for about and would have been for a line to Staten Island via the Staten Island Tunnel under the Narrows, which was aborted by Mayor Hylan before it was completed. There is a \\"maintenance of way\\" shed that was built on the southbound trackway. The northbound trackway is unobstructed, albeit much darker. The northbound trackway ends on a brick wall, with evidence of a void space beyond. South of this station, the bridge over the LIRR Bay Ridge Branch has four trackways, with the outer tracks occupying the two western ones. The tracks of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line are under the western half of Fourth Avenue at this point so that two additional tracks could be laid in the future if traffic warranted it. The original proposal planned a connection from a point between 65th and 67th Streets, just south of the station, running to Arrietta Street near the Tompkinsville station in Tompkinsville, Staten Island. A later plan called for a connection to St. George, Staten Island, near St. George Terminal. Construction for the latter started in 1923, but the project was canceled in 1925. ==Points of interest== The Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, the largest church in Brooklyn, is located one block east on Fifth Avenue between 59th and 60th Streets. The Brooklyn Army Terminal is located two blocks west, along with the NYC Ferry pier there, though there is no free transfer between the subway and the ferry. == References  External links == * * Station Reporter ‚Äî N Train * Station Reporter ‚Äî R Train * The Subway Nut ‚Äî 59th Street Pictures * 59th Street entrance from Google Maps Street View * Fourth Avenue entrance, midblock between 60th and 61st Streets, from Google Maps Street View * Platforms from Google Maps Street View Category:BMT Fourth Avenue Line stations Category:New York City Subway stations in Brooklyn Category:New York City Subway stations located underground Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1915 Category:Sunset Park, Brooklyn Category:1915 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"59th Street station (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)"},{"id":"2230853","text":"Crag Hill is a mountain in the North Western part of the English Lake District. It was formerly known as Eel Crag; however, the Ordnance Survey now marks Eel Crag as referring to the northern crags of the fell. It is not to be confused with another Crag Hill lying on the border of North Yorkshire. It overlooks the valleys of Rannerdale on the west, and Coledale on the east. It is the second highest fell in the area of high ground between the passes of Whinlatter and Newlands, second to Grasmoor. It is 839 m (2,753 feet) high, and has a relative height of 117 m. ==Topography== The North Western Fells occupy the area between the rivers Derwent and Cocker, a broadly oval swathe of hilly country, elongated on a north-south axis. Two roads cross from east to west, dividing the fells into three convenient groups. The central sector, rising between Whinlatter and Newlands passes, includes Crag Hill. The highest ground in the North Western Fells is an east-west ridge in this central sector, beginning with Grasmoor above Crummock Water and then gradually descending eastwards over Crag Hill, Sail, Scar Crags and Causey Pike. Grasmoor has the greatest elevation, but Crag Hill stands at the hub of the range. In plan it appears as a cross with ridges running to the four points of the compass. To the north of Crag Hill is the col of Coledale Hause, the high level connection to Hopegill Head, focal point of a parallel but slightly lower ridge. Valleys descend from either side of Coledale Hause, running between these two ridges. Gasgale Gill (or Liza Beck on OS maps) flows westward to the River Cocker, while Coledale Beck runs eastwards to the Derwent. Guarding the way up from the Hause to Crag Hill is Eel Crag, the face which gave the fell its former name. Crag Hill also has a southern ridge which steps down toward Buttermere over Wandope and Whiteless Pike. The valley of Rannerdale forms the western boundary with Sail Beck on the other side. Both empty into Crummock Water. The highest part of Crag Hill is near the 'cross' where the four ridges meet. Moving further east towards Sail, the ridge tapers down with crags on either side. Scott Crags stands over Coledale and Scar Crag (not to be confused with Scar Crags) looks down on Sail Beck. Beneath Scar Crag is Addacomb Hole, a deep corrie without a tarn. By contrast to the west of the summit the slopes are smooth and wide, although still steep. ==Geology== The summit areas of Crag Hill are composed of the Ordovician Kirkstile Formation. This is the typical rock of the Skiddaw fells and is composed of laminated mudstone and siltstone. Beneath this are the Greywacke sandstone turbidites of the Loweswater Formation. The Causey Pike Fault runs across the southern flanks of the fell, beyond which are the rocks of the Buttermere Formation.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) Although there is much evidence of mining activity in the surrounding fells, Crag Hill itself has remained untouched.Adams, John: Mines of the Lake District Fells: Dalesman (1995) ==Summit== The triangulation column on the summit of Crag Hill and the view south to the rightThe summit bears an Ordnance Survey triangulation column, set on a stony plateau though it has recently collapsed. The view is excellent, although robbed of some foreground by the flat expanse of the top. All of the major fell groups can be seen with the Scafells particularly fine. Although a higher neighbour, Grasmoor detracts little from the view to the west.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 6, The North Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1964): Bill Birkett:Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): ==Ascents== From the shore of Crummock Water, Rannerdale Beck can be followed to its source, gaining the ridge between Crag Hill and Wandope. The alternative western route follows Gasgale Gill up to its birthplace on Coledale Hause. From Braithwaite near Keswick at the opposite end of the ridge, Coledale Hause is also the first objective. From here a simple ascent turns Eel Crag to the west, although Wainwright listed more interesting alternatives on the eastern side of the crag. Many ascents of Crag Hill are made indirectly as part of a full traverse of the Grasmoor to Causey Pike ridge. Climbs from Buttermere via Whiteless Pike and Wandope are also practicable. Finally, rounds of either Coledale or Gasgale Gill, crossing to or from Hopegill Head via Coledale Hause, provide fine horseshoe walks for those needing to return to their starting point. ==References== Category:Fells of the Lake District Category:Hewitts of England Category:Nuttalls Category:Allerdale ","title":"Crag Hill"},{"id":"2230854","text":"The characteristic energy length scale \\\\chi describes the size of the region from which energy flows to a rapidly moving crack.

Tudigong ( \\"Lord of the Soil and the Ground\\") or Tudishen ( \\"God of the Soil and the Ground\\"), also known simply as Tudi ( \\"Soil-Ground\\") is a tutelary deity of a locality and the human communities who inhabit it in Chinese folk religion.The Encyclopedia of Malaysia, vol. Religions & Beliefs, edited by Prof. Dr M. Kamal Hassan & Dr. Ghazali bin Basri. ==Names== Other names of the god include:Keith G. Stevens, Chinese Mythological Gods, Oxford University Press, USA, (November 8, 2001), pages 60, 68, 70, or * Tugong ( \\"Lord of the Soil\\"); * Tudiye ( \\"Soil-Ground Father\\"); * Dabogong ( \\"Great Elder Lord\\") or Bogong ( \\"Elder Lord\\"); * Sheshen ( \\"God of the Soil\\") or Shegong ( \\"Lord of the Soil\\"); * Tudijun ( \\"Ruler God of the Soil\\"). Extended titles of the god include: * Tudihuofushen ( \\"God who May Bless the Soil\\"); * Fudezhengshen ( \\"Right God of Blessing and Virtue\\") or Fudegong ( \\"Lord of Blessing and Virtue\\"). Commoners often call Tudigong \\"grandfather\\" (yeye), which reflects his close relationship with the common people. ==VariantsTudipo=== In the countryside, he is sometimes given a wife, T«îd√¨p√≥ ( \\"Grandmother of the Soil and the Ground\\"), placed next to him on the altar. She may be seen as a just and benevolent deity on the same rank as her husband, or as a grudging old woman holding back her husband's benedictions, which explains why one does not always receive fair retribution for good behavior. Another story says that Tudipo is supposed to be a young lady. After Tudigong received a heavenly rank, he gave everything that the people asked for. When one of the gods went down to Earth to do inspections, he saw that Tudigong was distributing blessings unnecessarily. Soon after that, the god went to the Celestial Palace and reported to the Jade Emperor. After the Jade Emperor knew this, he found out that there was a lady that was going to be killed, but she was not guilty. Thus, the Jade Emperor told a god to go down to Earth and bring the lady to heaven. When the lady was brought to the Celestial Palace, the Jade Emperor bestowed her to Tudigong as his wife. She was ordered to look after how many blessings Tudigong distributes and that they not be unnecessarily distributed. This is why many people do not want to pay respect to Tudipo, because they are afraid that she will not let Tudigong give much wealth to them. ===Dizhushen=== The Landlord God () is a deity worshipped in Chinese folk beliefs who is analogous but is not to be confused with Tudigong. The tablet for the Landlord God is typically inscribed with (middle two rows) \\"left: The Earth God of Overseas Tang People (overseas Chinese; ), right: The Dragon of Five Sides and Five Lands (; fengshui). The side inscriptions mean \\"The wealth comes from ten thousand directions and the business comes from thousands of miles.\\" It is believed that the Landlord God has powers to help gather wealth, and the position of the tablet must be placed properly according to the laws of fengshui. ===Village Gods=== The Village God has developed from land worship. Before Chenghuangshen (\\"City God\\") became more prominent in China, land worship had a hierarchy of deities conforming strictly to social structure, in which the emperor, kings, dukes, officials and common people were allowed to worship only the land gods within their command; the highest land deity was the Houtu (\\"Queen of the Earth\\"). Ranked beneath City Gods, the Village Gods have been very popular among villagers as the grassroot deities since the 14th century during the Ming dynasty. Some scholars speculate that this change came because of an imperial edict, because it is reported that the Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty was born in a Village God shrine. The image of the Village God is that of a simply clothed, smiling, white-bearded man. His wife, the Grandmother of the Village, looks like a normal old lady. ==Festivals== In Taiwan, festivals dedicated to Tudigong typically take place on the second day of the second month and the 15th day of the eighth month on the Chinese lunar calendar. ==Gallery== File:Quanshan Tudi Gong Gong - furnace - DSCF8527.JPGA Tudigong temple in Quanzhou, Fujian.

Originally created in 1984 for a Saturday Night Live sketch, the Folksmen have subsequently maintained an intermittent public presence for more than twenty-five years. The trio is best known for its depiction in the mockumentary film A Mighty Wind (2003), but has also made a number of meta- performances on stage and television, often in conjunction with the same creators' fictitious heavy metal band, Spinal Tap. ==Film, television and concert depictions== Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer first appeared as the Folksmen on the November 3, 1984, episode of Saturday Night Live, the fourth episode of season 10. Guest and Shearer had both joined SNL as cast members that season, while McKean was hosting that episode. All three had previously worked together on comedy projects involving musical parody, including the Lenny and the Squigtones LP and a television pilot, The TV Show, which marked the first appearance of Spinal Tap. The SNL sketch, entitled \\"The Folksmen Reunion\\", had a similar satirical intent, targeting the renewed interest in American folk music following then-recent reunions of such artists as Peter, Paul & Mary (1978), The Weavers (1980), and The Kingston Trio (1981). Introduced by Pamela Stephenson, the SNL sketch depicted the Folksmen as caricatures of semi-retired folk musicians: three conservatively dressed middle-aged men, spouting homilies and performing simplistic songs with cloying lyrics. In a 2009 interview, Shearer stated that the songs were intended to satirize \\"the fake folk music being written in office buildings in Manhattan‚Äôs Upper West Side.\\" Guest, McKean and Shearer made a cameo appearance as the Folksmen in the 1992 film The Return of Spinal Tap, which documented the latter group's real-life reunion concert at Royal Albert Hall in London. When the trio subsequently toured as Spinal Tap during 2001, they would occasionally perform in the guise of the Folksmen as an ostensible \\"opening act\\"; not all of the audiences appreciated (or even understood) this in-joke, with one appearance in New York City reportedly being booed by a restless audience. Of this twist, Shearer once stated: \\"You can think you're in control of the amusing notion of the wrong act opening for a rock band‚Äîbut when you actually find yourself being the wrong act, it doesn't feel any better.\\"Barbara Hoffman, \\"The Old Folkies at Home\\", New York Post, Sep 20, 2003, p 25. In a 2009 interview, Guest reflected further on the phenomenon: The line between fiction and reality had previously blurred when, in 1993, Guest, McKean and Shearer performed as The Folksmen at a genuine folk festival held at UCLA in Los Angeles, alongside such real-life folk artists as Arlo Guthrie, Joni Mitchell and Peter, Paul & Mary. According to Guest, the Folksmen went over \\"better than the other acts\\", while McKean recalled that \\"Paul Stookey of Peter, Paul & Mary looked at us and muttered, 'Too close, too close.'\\" The Folksmen were incorporated into Christopher Guest's mockumentary A Mighty Wind (2003), which depicted a reunion concert of three fictitious folk music acts, following the death of their mutual manager, Irving Steinbloom. The film included interviews with the band members (which established much of their fictional backstory), reconstructed vintage footage and album covers, and various original songs performed in rehearsal as well as the purported concert, An Ode to Irving. To publicise the film, Guest, McKean and Shearer appeared as the Folksmen on a number of television programs, in which they performed songs and were interviewed in character. Between September and November 2003, the three fictitious folk groups from the film \\"reformed\\" to undertake a real-life concert tour of cities on the West Coast (Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle) and the East Coast (Boston; Philadelphia; New York; and Washington, D.C.). More recently, in April 2009, Guest, McKean and Shearer embarked upon the Unwigged & Unplugged tour to mark the 25th anniversary of the release of the film This is Spinal Tap.Andrew Gans, \\"Guest, McKean and Shearer Launch 30-City Tour of Unwigged & Unplugged April 17\\", Playbill, April 17, 2009. This time, they appeared as themselves, performing songs associated with Spinal Tap, the Folksmen and various other film and comedy projects from their long careers. After touring thirty cities in the United States, the trio performed a special \\"One Night Only World Tour\\" concert at London's Wembley Arena on June 30, 2009, in which they performed (this time in full costume) as both Spinal Tap and the Folksmen. ==Personnel== The fictional members of the Folksmen are: *Alan Barrows (played by Christopher Guest) ‚Äì vocals (tenor), guitar, banjo, mandolin *Jerry Palter (played by Michael McKean) ‚Äì vocals (baritone), guitar, mandolin *Mark/Marta Shubb (played by Harry Shearer) ‚Äì vocals (bass), double bass During televised appearances, Barrows/Guest has also been seeing playing the autoharp (on \\"Barnyard Symphony\\", as performed on Saturday Night Live in 1984) and penny whistle (on \\"Corn Wine\\", in a deleted scene from A Mighty Wind). The studio recording of \\"Skeletons of Quinto\\", included on the film's soundtrack CD, included guest appearances from prominent musicians David Nichtern (nylon string guitar) and Marston Smith (cello).Sleeve notes to A Mighty Wind motion picture soundtrack (DMZ/Columbia/Sony Music Soundtrax 5126562000). ==Fictional backstoryOrigins and early fame=== Characteristically, there is some dispute regarding the origins of the Folksmen. It was once claimed that the three members of the group originally met while they were freshmen at Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio.Chip Rowe. Spinal Tap A to Zed: A Guide to one of England's Loudest Bands (Third edition, 2002), p 49. However, in a 2003 interview, Mark Shubb and Alan Barrows stated that the two had actually met in late 1961 when both were studying at the University of Vermont in Burlington, Vermont. Barrows recalled that \\"we were both interested in folk music and there was a big folk music scene, as there were at many colleges.\\" They subsequently formed a musical duo known as The Twobadors. As recorded in an official band biography, later issued by Folktown Records, \\"In 1961, Vermont's own The Twobadors boarded a bus bound for New York City. Their first stop: Greenwich Village and The Folk Place. Inside, performing on the legendary stage was Jerry Palter\\". Palter, who was performing there as a guitarist and backing singer, sang baritone. As Barrows noted, \\"Mark was a bass singer and I was a tenor singer, so we had lead‚Äîno glue, no middle. We ended up getting together, and it just clicked.\\" As their official bio put it, \\"Alan and Mark had found their mid-range, and the Folksmen were born\\". The newly renamed trio soon attracted the attention of folk music impresario Irving Steinbloom (1920‚Äì2003), who became their manager and signed them to Folktown Records ‚Äì as Palter once put it, \\"THE label to be on.\\" In 1962, the group released the single \\"Old Joe's Place\\", which became a Top 70 hit and remains their best-known song. According to one source, the Folksmen remained together for 26 months (i.e. two and a half years), during which time they \\"played and sang their own brand of 'eclectified folk' music.\\" During this time they released no fewer than five studio albums. In a 2003 interview, Barrow recalled: \\"We figured that it would be amusing, at least to us, to have one word album titles, and we'd lop off the g's.\\" This, however, eventually came to a halt when, as Shubb noted in the same interview: \\"We violated our covenant with the audience with a record called Saying Something, which is two mistakes by my account ‚Äì two words, and two g's. All of our goodwill and tradition and good luck went down the toilet.\\" Compounding the problem, that album was released on a lesser subsidiary label, Folktone Records, which, as Palter notes, was \\"a decent label ‚Äì they just didn't have the distribution.\\" The album, elsewhere described as \\"their one and only experiment in electric\\", was not a success, and the trio disbanded soon afterward. Relegated to the status of a minor footnote in the annals of American folk music, the Folksmen would later be characterised as \\"the group who were too popular to be purist and too purist to be popular.\\" ===Reunions=== Little is known of the activities of the band members after its demise around 1968. In the early 1970s, Alan Barrows began teaching a creative writing course at Swarthmore College near Philadelphia and also taught a yoga class. In 1984, folk music impresario Albert Lilienthal (best known as the man who established the Eighty-eight Cent Hoot at the Seaman's Institute) invited the Folksmen to re- form for a special one-off appearance on Saturday Night Live. At the time, it was noted that this was the first time that they had performed together in almost twenty years. Their appearance prompted a renewed interest in the group's work, and it was subsequently reported that \\"they are again becoming a popular late addition to folk festivals within a day‚Äôs auto travel of their homes.\\" In 1992, the trio was scheduled to open for heavy metal band Spinal Tap during the latter's comeback concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London. However, there was some concern that the rowdy audience might threaten the safety of the performers, so they did not appear; instead, the Folksmen attempted to recoup their costs by busking, performing a version of \\"Kumbaya\\" inside South Kensington tube station. It was later reported on Spinal Tap's website that the Folksmen had signed a four-month lease on a 1994 Chrysler minivan in anticipation of Spinal Tap's proposed 1996 Third World Tour, and there were rumours that the Folksmen might put out a CD. However, neither the anticipated tour, nor the album, ever eventuated. In June 1993, the Folksmen appeared at the Troubadors of Folk festival at UCLA in Los Angeles, where they performed on the same bill as Paul Stookey, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Roger McGuinn and others.Chris Willman, \\"Folk springs eternal at Festival\\", Los Angeles Times, Jun 8, 1993, p 7. (Stookey allegedly saw the Folksmen and muttered, \\"Too close, too close.\\") Eight years later, they returned to UCLA to make a guest appearance at a tribute concert, The Harry Smith Project, dedicated to the late folk music anthologist Harry Everett Smith. In 2003, the Folksmen reunited far more prominently for another tribute concert, this time in honour of their former manager, Irving Steinbloom, who died that year. In the days leading up to the concert, the trio met for a reunion barbecue in upstate New York, during which they rehearsed several numbers from their back catalogue including \\"Blood on the Coal,\\" \\"Corn Wine,\\" \\"Loco Man,\\" and \\"Skeletons of Quinto.\\" At the concert itself, the group originally intended to open with \\"Never Did No Wanderin\\". Unbeknownst to them, The New Main Street Singers, another Steinbloom-managed group performing that night, end up performing the song.

In Turkish, copulas are called ek-eylem () or ek-fiil () ('suffix-verb'). The Turkish copula is one of the more distinct features of Turkish grammar. Turkish is a highly agglutinative language and copulas are rendered as suffixes, albeit with a few exceptions. == Zero copula == Zero copula is the rule for third person, as in Hungarian and Russian. That means two nouns, or a noun and an adjective can be juxtaposed to make a sentence without using any copula. Third-person plural might be indicated with the use of plural suffix -lar/-ler. :{ border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"6\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" -  Hakan yolcu.  Hakan is a traveller. -  Deniz mavi.  The sea is blue. -  Kapƒ±lar ve camlar a√ßƒ±k.  The doors and windows are open. -  Asans√∂r bozuk.  The elevator is broken. -  ƒ∞≈ü√ßiler √ºzg√ºn.  The workers are sad. } == To be (olmak versus imek) == Turkish \\"to be\\" as regular/auxiliary verb (olmak) and \\"to be\\" as copula (imek) contrasts. The auxiliary verb imek (i- is the root) shows its existence only through suffixes to predicates that can be nouns, adjectives or arguably conjugated verb stems, arguably being the only irregular verb in Turkish. The missing forms of i- are supplied by ol-: the infinitive olmak is an example, since there is no infinitive *imek. An infinitive ermek appeared in ancient texts; its stem er- became the current i-.G. L. Lewis, Turkish Grammar, Oxford University Press, 1967; 2nd edition, 2000 The word idir, a variation of imek indicates alethic modality, so is used for emphasis, or to prevent ambiguity. ƒ∞dir is an enclitic word, and exhibits vowel harmony when used as a suffix. Therefore Ali asker idir turns into Ali askerdir. In examples, emphasised word is written bold: :{ border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"6\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\"  align=left   align=right  -  Abbas yolcudur.  Abbas is a traveller. -  Deniz mavidir.  The sea is blue. -  Kapƒ±lar ve camlar a√ßƒ±ktƒ±r.  The doors and windows are open. -  Asans√∂r bozuktur.  The lift is broken. -  ƒ∞≈ü√ßiler √ºzg√ºnd√ºr.  The workers are sad. } == Negative copula == Negation is indicated by the negative copula deƒüil. Deƒüil is never used as a suffix, but it takes suffixes according to context. :{ border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"6\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\"  align=left   align=right  -  Abbas yolcu deƒüil.  Abbas is not a traveller. -  Kapƒ±lar ve camlar a√ßƒ±k deƒüildir.  The doors and windows are not open. -  √ñƒüretmen deƒüilim.  I am not a/the teacher. -  Mutlu deƒüilmi≈üiz  (Apparently) we were not happy. } == Personal copulas == A complete sentence is formed by the addition of a suffix to a noun or adjective as an instance of nonverbal person agreement, with the conjugate verb \\"imek\\" only implied. These suffixes are, in origin, personal pronouns and indicate grammatical person. :{ border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"6\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" -  √ñƒüretmen-i-m  teacher--  I am a/the teacher -  √ñƒüretmen-si-n  teacher--  You are a/the teacher -  √ñƒüretmen  teacher  He/she/it is a/the teacher -  √ñƒüretmen-i-z  teacher--  We are (the) teachers -  √ñƒüretmen-si-niz  teacher--  You [plural/formal] are (a/the) teacher(s) -  √ñƒüretmen-ler  teacher-  They are (the) teachers } == Past copulas == Alethic past tense is indicated with idi, another variation of imek. It is enclitic and exhibits vowel harmony like idir. :{ border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"6\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" -  √ñƒüretmen-di-m  teacher--  I was a/the teacher (as I know) -  √ñƒüretmen-di-n  teacher--  You were a/the teacher (as I know) -  √ñƒüretmen-di  teacher-  He/she/it was a/the teacher (as I know) -  √ñƒüretmen-di-k  teacher--  We were (the) teachers (as I know) -  √ñƒüretmen-di-niz  teacher--  You [plural/formal] were (a/the) teacher(s) (as I know) -  √ñƒüretmen-di-ler  teacher--  They were (the) teachers (as I know) } The inferential past tense is indicated with imi≈ü. It is enclitic and exhibits vowel harmony like idir. :{ border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"6\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" -  √ñƒüretmen-mi≈ü-i-m  teacher---  I was a/the teacher (as I've heard) -  √ñƒüretmen-mi≈ü-si-n  teacher---  You were a/the teacher (as I've heard) -  √ñƒüretmen-mi≈ü  teacher-  He/she/it was a/the teacher (as I've heard) -  √ñƒüretmen-mi≈ü-i-z  teacher---  We were (the) teachers (as I've heard) -  √ñƒüretmen-mi≈ü-si-niz  teacher---  You [plural/formal] were (a/the) teacher(s) (as I've heard) -  √ñƒüretmen-ler-mi≈ü  teacher--  They were (the) teachers (as I've heard) } == Conditional copulas == Conditional (hypothetical) mood is indicated with ise. It is enclitic and exhibits vowel harmony like idir. :{ border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"6\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" -  √ñƒüretmen-se-m  teacher--  If I am a/the teacher -  √ñƒüretmen-se-n  teacher--  If you are a/the teacher -  √ñƒüretmen-se  teacher-  If he/she/it is a/the teacher -  √ñƒüretmen-se-k  teacher--  If we are (the) teachers -  √ñƒüretmen-se-niz  teacher--  If you [plural/formal] are (a/the) teacher(s) -  √ñƒüretmen-ler-se  teacher--  If they are (the) teachers } ==References== Copula ","title":"Turkish copula"},{"id":"2230874","text":"The American University Washington College of Law (WCL) is the law school of American University. It is located on the western side of Tenley Circle in the Tenleytown section of Northwest Washington, D.C., one block south of the Tenleytown-AU Metro station. The school is fully accredited by the American Bar Association, and a member of the AALS. WCL is ranked 76th in the nation in the Best Law Schools by U.S. News & World Report, and has highly ranked specialty programs in Clinical Training (#2), International Law (#4), Trial Advocacy (#4), Intellectual Property (#10), Part-Time Law (#6), and Health Care Law (#11). The Times Higher Education World University Rankings places American as 69th in the world for law. Begun in 1896, it was the first law school to be founded by women, the first with a female dean, and the first to graduate an all-female class. ==HistoryEarly beginnings=== Ellen Spencer Mussey and Emma Gillett began teaching in Mussey's law offices in 1898 after they were approached by three women who wished to study with them. Not originally intending to create a full-fledged law school, they requested the law school of Columbian College to accept the six women for their final year. When Columbian refused the request on the ground that \\"women did not have the mentality for law\\", the two women became determined to complete the students' education themselves and to found a co-educational law school that was specifically open to women. Although Gillett was a graduate of Howard University School of Law, Washington College of Law only accepted white applicants. With its first graduating class, the Washington College of Law became the first law school to be founded by women, the first with a female dean, and the first law school to graduate an all-female class. Mussey's male law clerk enrolled in 1897, making the school officially coeducational. ===Continuing growth=== Washington D.C. incorporated WCL in 1898. After several temporary locations, the school moved to the Le Droit Building on 8th & F Streets in 1900. Enrollment rose to 55 students by 1908 and doubled in five years to 128 students. Dean Mussey secured a lease in 1909 in the Chesley Building on New York Ave, until the school outgrew the six-classroom lease. The school moved to its first permanent home in 1920; the former residence of Robert G. Ingersoll on K Street. Continually growing, WCL moved in 1924 to the former home of Oscar Underwood, and former residence of Archibald Butt. WCL merged with American University in 1949 and graduated its first African American student in 1953. The Women & the Law Program was launched in 1948, to promote the integration of women's rights and gender studies into legal education, practice and doctrine. After years of work by Dean Myers, the John Sherman Myers Law School building was constructed on the American University main campus and dedicated in 1963 by Chief Justice Earl Warren. In the same year, U.S. Senator Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) graduated from WCL after ten years of night-study classes, the first time a sitting member of Congress had begun and completed a law degree while serving. By 1988, WCL had grown to over 1,000 students. Dean Milstein pushed for a new building, and in 1996 WCL moved less than a mile to The John Sherman Myers and Alvina Reckman Myers Law Center on Massachusetts Avenue in the American University Park section of Northwest Washington, D.C. The building was two and a half times larger than the previous Myers building, and included the new Pence Law Library. View of the American University Washington College of Law's Capital Building from Tenley Circle ===Move to Tenley Campus=== In April 2012, the D.C. Zoning Commission approved the plans for American University Washington College of Law to relocate from Spring Valley to American University's Tenley Campus. The approval of plans for further processing and zoning variances for the law school was handed down after American University's full campus plan was approved in March. Construction began in the summer of 2013, with relocation of the law school to the new campus completed in early 2016. Spring 2016 semester classes began at the new campus on January 11, 2016. ==Academic reputation== WCL's Master of Laws (LL.M.) program ranks 13th nationally in the 2012 AUAP rankings. The Brian Leiter Law School rankings placed the WCL 47th in the 2012 Top 70 Law Faculties in Scholarly Impact. National Jurist ranked WCL the fifth best law school for Hispanic students in 2008. It ranked WCL the 4th best public interest law school in the nation. U.S. News & World Report ranks WCL 77th in the nation among the 146 ranked schools. WCL's clinical training, international law, intellectual property, and part-time programs are ranked 4th, 6th, 9th, and 7th in the nation respectively. The school maintains programs in both human rights and public interest law. WCL's Equal Justice Foundation (EJF) provides scholarships to students who obtain unpaid summer internships with public interest organizations. ==Costs and student debt== The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at WCL for the 2018-2019 academic year is $81,922. The Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years is $293,573.

Ghee Hin literally means \\"the rise of righteousness\\" in Chinese. The Ghee Hin often fought against the Hakka-dominated Hai San secret society. Ghee Hin was initially dominated by the Cantonese, although Hokkiens formed the majority by 1860. Teochew, Hainanese and Hakka form smaller minorities. One of the major leader of Ghee Hin was Chin Ah Yam, a Hakka peasant from the rural Dabu county, Guangdong. Their main lodge was located in Lavender Street, which contained the ancestral tablets of important ex-members, before being donated to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital when it was torn down in 1892, following the Suppression of Secret Societies Ordinance. The Ghee Hin were notorious for mass-killings against the Catholic Hakka ethnic group in 1850 (killing about 500), as well as post offices in 1876, against a new, and more expensive, monopoly on post and remittances. The colonial government began to move towards surveillance, control, and finally suppression from the 1890s onwards. Ghee Hin and Hai San were the two secret societies that were involved in Perak civil war in the 19th century. Ghee Hin and Hai San were always fighting against each other to compete for land, houses and food. The Teochews who belonged to the Ghee Hin secret society were massacred by the thousands. ==References== *Lim, Irene.

Bryson covers all corners of the island, observing and talking to people from as far afield as Exeter in the West Country to John o' Groats at the north-eastern tip of Scotland's mainland. During this trip he insisted on using only public transport, but failed on two occasions: in Oxfordshire and on the journey to John o' Groats he had to rent a car. He also re-visits Virginia Water where he worked at the Holloway Sanatorium when he first came to Britain in 1973. (He met his future wife while employed at Holloway.) On his way, Bryson provides historical information on the places he visits, and expresses amazement at the heritage in Britain, stating that there were 445,000 listed historical buildings, 12,000 medieval churches, of common land, of footpaths and public rights-of- way, 600,000 known sites of archaeological interest and that in his Yorkshire village at that time, there were more 17th century buildings than in the whole of North America. Bryson also pays homage to the humble self-effacing fortitude of British people under trying times, such as the world wars and Great Depression, as well as the various peculiarities of Britain and British English (such as not understanding, on his first arrival, what a counterpane was, and assuming it was something to do with a window. It is a British English word that means quilt.) Bryson also recalls first going into an English tobacconist's and hearing the man in front of him ask for \\"Twenty Number 6\\", and assuming that everything in Britain was ordered by number. (A popular brand at the time was Players No. 6, and in British English it is usual to ask for 'twenty' (cigarettes), meaning a packet, not twenty of them.) ==Reception== In an opinion poll organised for World Book Day in 2003, Notes from a Small Island was voted by BBC Radio 4 listeners as the book which best represented England. The book was adapted for Carlton Television in 1998 and appeared as a six-part 30-minute documentary broadcast on ITV from January to February 1999. The book is also available in audio book format. Heavily abridged, the book was read in five fifteen-minute episodes by Kerry Shale for BBC Radio 4. It has been repeated on BBC Radio 7 several times. Bryson praises the city of Durham in the book. He later became Chancellor of Durham University from 2005 to 2011. The title of Briton Neil Humphreys' book Notes from an Even Smaller Island (written on his experiences in the former Crown Colony of Singapore) is a reference to Bryson's book, Humphreys stating in 2012, \\"When I read Bill Bryson's travel books, I was inspired to do something similar in Asia (some might say rip him off! Luckily, Bill Bryson doesn't say that!)\\".Interview with Neil Humphreys Dear Bill Bryson: Footnotes from a Small Island (2015) is an irreverent homage to Notes from a Small Island, wherein Ben Aitken retraces Bryson‚Äôs journey as precisely as possible ‚Äì same hotels, same plates of food, same amount of time in the bath ‚Äì before finishing outside his house on Christmas Eve. == References == Category:Books by Bill Bryson Category:Books about the United Kingdom Category:1995 books Category:HarperCollins books ","title":"Notes from a Small Island"},{"id":"2230899","text":"A custodial sentence is a judicial sentence, imposing a punishment consisting of mandatory custody of the convict, either in prison or in some other closed therapeutic or educational institution, such as a reformatory, (maximum security) psychiatry or drug detoxification (especially cold turkey). As 'custodial' suggests, the sentence requires the suspension of an individual's liberty and the assumption of responsibility over the individual by another body or institution. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 (England and Wales) states that '(2)The court must not pass a custodial sentence unless it is of the opinion that the offence, or the combination of the offence and one or more offences associated with it, was so serious that neither a fine alone nor a community sentence can be justified for the offence'. Some serious offences incur minimum custodial sentences, unless there are exceptional circumstances. Custodial sentences may also be used where there is a perceived threat to public safety. Community sentences are non-custodial and include fines, various mandatory but 'open' therapy and courses, restriction orders and loss or suspension of civil rights. ==See also== * Capital punishment * Community sentence * Suspended sentence ==References== Category:Penal imprisonment ","title":"Custodial sentence"},{"id":"2230908","text":"Supersub may mean: * supersub, a cricket term for a type of substitute player/player substitution. * super-submarine sandwich, a larger, longer or more stuffed hero sandwich. * a super-submarine, a superior underwater vehicle. ** Japanese supersub, the World War II-era I-400 class submarine ** Narco supersub, the true-submarines (as opposed to semi-subs) for narcotics smuggling, see narco submarine *Supersub, a nickname of David Fairclough (born 1957), English footballer ","title":"Supersub"},{"id":"2230910","text":"{ ;' align=right width=\\"244px\\" -  align=left DDAA22\\" <<  align=center DDAA22\\" Choitro  align=right DDAA22\\" >> - colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 240px - colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"text-align: center; font-size: 80%;\\" The month of Choitro is known for colourful flowers in Bangladesh } Choitro () is the last month of the Bengali calendar.

The series aired on TBS Television affiliates on the Wednesday 7:00 PM time slot from April 4, 1979 to March 26, 1980, lasting a total of 50 episodes. It was the eighth installment in the Ultra Series and began airing four years after the end of Ultraman Leo. The show was the first animated incarnation of Tsuburaya's iconic superhero Ultraman, as well as one of the earliest works of anime studio Nippon Sunrise (now known simply as Sunrise), who also worked on their now-iconic mecha series Mobile Suit Gundam during the same year. ==Story== In the 21st century, various mysterious events occur on Earth, causing monsters to appear all of a sudden. EGG3 officer Ch≈çichir≈ç Hikari was scouted to join the Science Guard on Earth but while on his way back, he was bonded to Ultraman Joneus, an Ultra Person of U40 who was sent by his brethren to fight against the monster threats and alien invasions. This allows the youth to become an Ultraman against countless enemies while keeping his identity a secret from his fellow members. Almost in the middle of the series, both Hikari and Joneus lost their lives from fighting the Spirit Parasite. They were spirited to the Ultra Planet U40 by Elek, and discovered the Ultra People's connection to the Earth in the past. Hikari and Joneus were revived in said planet and helped foiled the invaders Badel Tribe to reclaim the stolen Ultra Mind. Starting from episode 28, Daisuke Gond≈ç becomes a new captain to the Science Guard. Despite their rocky start, the team learn to accept him due to his great intuition and brotherly instinct. Amia would return to Earth to warn Hikari and the Science Guard of the invasion of Heller Empire, a renegade faction of Ultra People that invaded their home world and saw Earth as their next target due to Joneus' involvement. The Heller Empire was led by Heller, who was banished due to his misuse of the Ultra Mind for immortality. The Science Guard were given the Ultria, an ancient battleship made by the Ultra People to counter invasion attempts made by the Heller Army. In the four final episodes, Heller sent a full-scale invasion on Earth to wipe humanity after fearing that they would cooperate with the remaining Ultra People. The Science Guard disobeyed the Earth Self Defense Army to go into space, joining forces with the remaining U40 resistances to form the U Fleet and attacked the Titan Base on Saturn to prevent more invasion forces from coming to Earth. On U40, the Science Guard made a risky attempt to sneak into the Heller City to weaken its defense as the U Fleet attacked Heller's forces in the planet's outer atmosphere. When the Science Guard were about to be killed by Mac Datar, Hikari's secret was exposed to save his comrades before joining the remaining seven Ultras in foiling Heller's attempts to escape. With Amia and the Great Sage being rescued, Heller died in the ensuing explosion as U40 celebrated their victory. Joneus finally separated from Hikari and spent several months to observe Earth with his sister Amia. Once assuring that peace had returned, they bid farewell to the Science Guard and promised to return when the Earth's safety is threatened once more. == Staff == {  +Opening Credits !Producers Noboru Tsuburaya, Kazuho Mitsuda, Masaru Tadakuma - !Music by Kunio Miyauchi & Toru Fuyuki - !Lyrics Yu Aku - !Theme Song Performed by Isao Sasaki - !Published in Shogakukan's \\"Tv-Kun\\" and Other Learning Magazines Kodansha's \\"Tv Magazine\\" and Other Learning Magazines - !Animation Supervision & Character Design Tsuneo Ninomiya - !Designers / Monster Concept Akihiko Takahashi & Osamu Yamaguchi - !Chief Directors / Storyboarding Hisayuki Toriumi, Takeyuki Kanda - !Production Producer Yasuo Shibue - !Animation Produced by Logi Studio - !Produced by Tsuburaya Productions, Tokyo Broadcasting System } {  + End Credits !Written by Keiichi Abe, Soji Yoshikawa, Hiroyuki Hoshiyama Bunzo Wakatsuki, Yoshihisa Araki, Keisuke Fujikawa Yasushi Hirano, Shiro Azusazawa, Yuki Miyata - !Directed by Masahisa Ishida, Junyasu Furukawa, Takao Shitsuji, Hideyoshi Oshika, Takashi Ano, Katsuyuki Tsuji, Masami Yagioka, Hiromichi Matano, Osamu Sekita - !Storyboard Yuji Nunokawa, Kazuo Terada, Asahi Yahiro Seiji Okuda, Soji Yoshikawa, Motosuke Takahashi Kohei Matsuura, Noboru Ishiguro, Toru Sakata Mitsuru Hikita, Takeshi Shirato, Tsutomu Yamaguchi Kazuho Mitsuda, Masaoka Fujioka, Toru Yoshida Kazuo Yamazaki, Ryosuke Takahashi, Yoshiyuki Tomino - !In Charge of Literature Kazuichi Tsurumi - !Mechanical Design Kunio Okakawa, Studio Nue - !Art Mitsuaki Nakamura, Nobuto Sakamoto, Kazuo Miyagawa, Shin Sato, Torio Arai - !Director of Animation Kazuo Nakamura - !Animation by Sunrise Studio, Waap, Green Box, Anime R, Tiger & Nakamura Productions - !Monster Concept Minoru Kujirai, Fumio Ogawa, Yoshio Tsuburaya, Yasumi Asahi, Seiichi Saito, Masahiko Watanabe - !Color Designation Hiroshi Wakao, Atsuko Oikawa, Shinichi Hatori, Kazumi Matsui, Hiroshi Hasegawa, Sachiyo Osawa, Yayoi Suzuki - !Ink And Paint Shaft, Green BOX, Studio Deen, Kuma Productions, Studio Juffs - !Backgrounds Mascot, Production Eye, Big Studios, Artland, Art Take 1, Magic House, Baku Productions, Studio Apple - !Special Effects Michiaki Doi, Masanori Yamazaki, Green Box, Takao Tanaka, Hiroshi Kazao - !Rostrum Camera Asahi Productions and Zenji Furukawa - !Editing by Tomoaki Tsurubuchi, Fumio Otachi, Tsurubuchi Films, Yukio Watanabe, Fumiei Kataishi - !Titles Studio Try - !Film Processing Tokyo Laboratories - !Audio Director Toshimi Toriumi - !Mixing Manji Nanbu - !Production Coordinator Hisayoshi Takahashi - !Recorded at Niisaka Recording - !Production Managers Noboru Mano, Keiichi Kobayashi, Akira Machida, Yoshihide Fujita, Eiichi Endo, Hideo Hayashi, Masahiko Matsuo, Eizo Takahashi, Masami Yagioka, Mashiro Ueda, Tadayoshi Kusari, Setsuo Fukada, Katsushi Kaniyama - !Desk Yoshiyuki Yoshina, Noboru Mano - !Planning Desk Naoyuki Eto - !In Charge of Production Yoshikazu Tochihira } == English Dubbing Staff == {  +A New Hero is Born!! ~ Chase The Mysterious Red Cloud!! ! colspan=\\"2\\" Staff - !Executive Producer Mark Cohen - !Produced by Sydney L.

Despite the title, it has no continuity with the previous English dub of the series. Although the translation is closer to the original Japanese scripts than the first movie, the characters' names were still changed (although, the names given to the characters are not the same ones used in the previous dub). The order of the third and fourth episodes were also switched. ===Television releases=== *On April 5, 1980, episode 14 of The Ultraman aired on U.S. national television when New York superstation WOR-TV Channel 9 (now WWOR) aired it as the first part of \\"Japan Tonight!\\", a special seven-hour block of programming from TBS (Tokyo Broadcasting System), hosted by actor Telly Savalas. Japanese actress/author/talk show host Tetsuko Kuroyanagi introduced the episode surrounded by assorted Ultraman toys and merchandise while explaining to the American audience just who Ultraman is, \\"It's very, very popular in Japan - He's like your Superman\\". The episode was dubbed into English by William Ross (Frontier Enterprises) in Japan and was sponsored by Bandai America. *In April 2017, the television network TOKU announced that they would release the series in the United States in the near future.

A revamped version of the series, entitled Pros and Cons, aired briefly the following season. ==Overview== The main character, Gabriel Bird, was played by James Earl Jones. He was a former Chicago police officer who, over twenty years prior, had been wrongfully sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of a fellow police officer. In fact, he shot the officer to protect a defenseless mother and child whom the officer was about to murder in cold blood during a 1969 police raid. Unbeknownst to Bird, the raid had been merely a pretext for the police to attack the members of a militant black nationalist organization. This incident in the character's background was inspired by the 1969 death of Black Panther Party leader Fred Hampton, who was shot and killed during a raid upon his residence conducted by Chicago police and other law enforcement personnel. On the show, the street on which the raid involving Bird had occurred was identified as \\"Hampton Street\\". When Bird is released, he starts working as a private detective, hired by the lawyer who had helped free him. ===Pros and Cons=Characters== *Gabriel Bird, played by James Earl Jones *Jamil, played by Brian K.

It is the most popular traditional black tea brand sold in the UK.

Taylors of Harrogate is still based in Harrogate, Yorkshire, in the first 'Betty's' tea room. The group is still owned by the family of Bettys' founder, Fredrick Belmont and is currently chaired by Lesley Wild. The company is one of the few remaining family tea and coffee merchants in the country, whilst competing with the British-owned PG Tips (Unilever) and Tetley (Tata), where Yorkshire Tea is now the most purchased tea brand in the UK, overtaking Twinings (Associated British Foods) and Typhoo. == Products == Yorkshire Tea area at the Stray Harrogate Yorkshire Tea uses varieties of tea grown in Assam, Sri Lanka, and Kenya, blended to form four varieties: *Yorkshire Tea (commonly known as Yorkshire Red) *Yorkshire Tea for hard water (available in the United Kingdom) *Yorkshire Gold *Yorkshire Tea Decaffeinated *Yorkshire Proper Strong Tea (available in Australia) The Yorkshire Tea brand is being extended to include a range of cakes, biscuits, and fruit loaves, sold as being complementary to drinking tea by its parent company The Bettys & Taylors Group, which owns cookery schools and tea rooms. ==History== Charles Edward Taylor and his brother created their company, CE Taylor & Co., in 1886 which was later shortened to \\"Taylor's\\". The brothers later opened \\"Tea Kiosks\\" in the Yorkshire towns of Harrogate and Ilkley, and in 1962, local tea room competitor 'Betty's' took over 'Taylor's', renamed it 'Taylors of Harrogate' and formed the Bettys & Taylors Group, which is still owned by the family of Fredrick Belmont, who founded 'Bettys Tea Rooms'. The Group now uses the 'Bettys' and 'Taylors' brands in a number of industries including Yorkshire Tea and Taylors Coffee Merchants under the 'Taylors of Harrogate' name and Bettys Tea Rooms, Bettys Cookery School and Bettys Confectionery under the 'Bettys' brand. Yorkshire Tea as a brand was launched in 1977, originally conceived as 'Yorkshire Tea for Yorkshire people, and Yorkshire water-types'. In the early days different blends were created and sold for different regions of Yorkshire where the hardness / softness of the water varied. Over time, and as the scale of the brand grew to be fully national, the product has evolved to one single blend in the standard orange-coloured pack. However, it retains a hard water variant in green-coloured packs to cater for those who live in hard water areas of the UK. When Safeway was taken over by West Yorkshire-based Morrisons in 2004, commentators in the London press noted the amount of shelf space in one former Safeway store that was suddenly given over to Yorkshire Tea. In 2009, the Prince of Wales granted Yorkshire Tea a Royal Warrant. The company has also sponsored ITV1's Yorkshire-based Heartbeat from 1998 to 2001. By 2015, Yorkshire Tea was the third best-selling tea brand in Britain behind Tetley and PG Tips. By September 2017, it was the second best-selling brand behind PG Tips after having overtaken Tetley on sales in the traditional \\"black tea\\" market. In November 2019, it was revealed that Yorkshire Tea was now the number one selling brand of tea in the United Kingdom with 28% of the traditional black tea market. ==Advertising and popular culture== In 2007, a new TV campaign was created using the line \\"Try It, You'll See\\", voiced by Bill Nighy. Yorkshire Gold is mentioned in the popular Showtime TV series Homeland as a favourite of protagonist Sergeant Nicholas Brody. Ian Brabbin, tea buyer at Bettys and Taylors of Harrogate said: > We were both surprised and delighted to discover that Yorkshire Gold has > been given such a starring role in Homeland and are looking forward to > seeing the show when it arrives on our screens here later in the year. We > are no strangers to the small screen ‚Äì Yorkshire Tea has also made a cameo > appearance on Friends, not to mention our ever growing band of celebrity > fans such as Noel Gallagher and Alan Carr. Also on the celebrity fan list are Russell Crowe, who posted on Twitter about the beverage in 2012, and who visited Yorkshire Teas' headquarters in Harrogate whilst touring with his band. Other aficionados include Martha Reeves, who was also featured on the social media site holding Yorkshire Tea paraphernalia, and Patrick Stewart who indicated Yorkshire Gold was his favourite tea during a Reddit Ask Me Anything session. Yorkshire Tea is notable for its packaging which features romanticised Yorkshire Dales landscapes, although from time to time it explores other themes. As an official supporter of the Grand D√©part of the 2014 Tour de France in Yorkshire, Yorkshire Tea produced a 30g special edition sample pack rebranded as Yorkshire Th√©. As well as the name change, the orange on the usual box was replaced with yellow. On the hard water variety of the special edition Yorkshire Th√© packaging the band remained green. In 2016 Yorkshire Tea was made available inside a promotional tea caddy linked to a tree planting campaign with artwork featuring characters from the children's book The Gruffalo and branded Yorkshire Tree. The YouTuber \\"The Spiffing Brit\\" constantly advertises Yorkshire Tea in his videos, allegedly without any official connection to or contract with the Bettys & Taylors Group. On 5 March 2020, his 1 million subscriber Q&A; special was sponsored by Yorkshire Tea. ==See also== *Bettys and Taylors of Harrogate ==References * Official website (UK) * Official website (Australia) * Official website (USA) Category:1886 establishments in England Category:English brands Category:English drinks Category:Tea brands in United Kingdom Category:Yorkshire cuisine ","title":"Yorkshire Tea"},{"id":"2230948","text":"The Forsyth Classic was an event on the Symetra Tour, the LPGA's developmental tour.

Shark repellents are a category of animal repellents. Shark repellent technologies include magnetic shark repellent, electropositive shark repellents, electrical repellents, and semiochemicals. Shark repellents can be used to protect people from sharks by driving the sharks away from areas where they are likely to kill human beings. In other applications, they can be used to keep sharks away from areas they may be a danger to themselves due to human activity. In this case, the shark repellent serves as a shark conservation method. There are some naturally-occurring shark repellents; modern artificial shark repellents date to at least the 1940s, with the United States Navy using them in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II. ==Natural repellents== It has traditionally been believed that sharks are repelled by the smell of a dead shark;Researchers tout shark repellent, 2004 Associated Press, \\"Fisherman and scientists have long noted sharks stay away if they smell a dead shark.\\" however, modern research has had mixed results. The Pardachirus marmoratus fish (finless sole, Red Sea Moses sole) repels sharks through its secretions. The best-understood factor is pardaxin, acting as an irritant to the sharks' gills, but other chemicals have been identified as contributing to the repellent effect. In 2017, the US Navy announced that it was developing a synthetic analog of hagfish slime with potential application as a shark repellent. ==History== Some of the earliest research on shark repellents took place during the Second World War when military services sought to minimize the risk to stranded aviators and sailors in the water. Research has continued to the present, with notable researchers including Americans Eugenie Clark, and later Samuel H. Gruber, who has conducted tests at the Bimini Sharklab in Bimini, and the Japanese scientist Kazuo Tachibana. Initial work, which was based on historical research and studies at the time, focused on using the odor of another dead shark. Efforts were made to isolate the active components in dead shark bodies that repelled other sharks. Eventually, it was determined that certain copper compounds like copper acetate,Thomas B. Allen. Shadows in the Sea: The Sharks, Skates and Rays in combination with other ingredients, could mimic a dead shark and drive live sharks away from human beings in the water. Building on this work, Stewart Springer and others patented a \\"shark repellent\\" consisting of a combination of copper acetate and a dark-colored dye to obscure the user. This shark repellent, known as \\"Shark Chaser,\\" was long supplied to sailors and aviators of the United States Navy, initially packaged in cake form using a water-soluble wax binder and rigged to life vests. The Navy employed Shark Chaser extensively between 1943 and 1973. It is believed that the composition does repel sharks in some situations, but not in all, with about a 70% effectiveness rating. On the other hand, Albert Tester questioned the idea that dead shark bodies or chemicals based on them could work as shark repellent. In 1959, he prepared and tested extracts of decaying shark flesh on tiger sharks in Hawaii and blacktip sharks at Enewetak Atoll. Tester found that not only did the dead shark extracts fail to repel any sharks, but several sharks had a \\"weak or strong attraction\\" to them. Tester reported a similar failure to repel sharks by a 1959 test at Enewetak of \\"an alleged shark repellent, supplied by a fisherman, which contained extract of decayed shark flesh as the principal component.\\" Research has continued into the 2000s on using extracts from dead sharks or synthesizing such chemicals. ==Research== Since the 1970s, there have been studies of how the Moses sole repels sharks, with Clark and Gruber both studying it. it has not found practical use, however, as the chemicals are perishable, and the repellent had to be injected into the shark's mouth to be effective; in nature the substance is secreted on the skin and is thus ingested by sharks when they bite the sole. Since the 1980s, there is evidence that surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate can act as a shark repellent at concentrations on the order of 100 parts per million. However, this does not meet the desired \\"cloud\\" deterrence level of 0.1 parts per million. There have been validated field tests and studies to confirm the effectiveness of semiochemicals as a shark repellent. From 2005-2010, an extensive study on the effectiveness of semiochemicals as a shark repellent was conducted by scientists from SharkDefense Technologies and Seton Hall University. The study's results were published in the scientific journal Ocean & Coastal Management in 2013. The study concluded that the existence of a putative chemical shark repellent has been confirmed.http://bmis.wcpfc.int/docs/references/Stroud_etal_2013_Chemical_shark_repellent_Myth_fact_necromones_effect_OpenA.pdf As of 2014, SharkDefense partnered with SharkTec LLC to manufacture the semiochemical in a canister as a shark repellent for consumers called Anti- Shark 100. Recently, SharkDefense used the same semiochemicals found in SharkTec's product to reduce shark by-catch by 71% in a government grant initiative. The government agency NOAA released these findings in a report to Congress. In 2018 independent tests were carried out on five Shark Repellent technologies using Great white sharks. Only Shark Shield‚Äôs Ocean Guardian Freedom+ Surf showed measureable results, with encounters reduced from 96% to 40%. Rpela (electrical repellent technology), SharkBanz bracelet & SharkBanz surf leash (magnetic shark repellent technology) and Chillax Wax (semiochemical) showed no measureable effect on reducing shark attacks. ==In popular culture== In a 2015 a MythBusters episode, the hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman used an extract of dead sharks, and were able to drive away 10-20 Caribbean reef sharks and nurse sharks in only a few seconds on two separate occasions. The repellent used consisted of extracts from other species of shark bodies, and sharks did not return for over 5 minutes on both occasions. The 1947 Robb White book Secret Sea mentions a copper acetate shark repellent developed by the U.S. Navy.White, Robb, Secret Sea (New York: Scholastic Book Services, 1968 reprint edition), p. 182. ==References== Category:Pesticides Category:Shark attack prevention ","title":"Shark repellent"},{"id":"2230959","text":"Charlie Pace is a fictional character on ABC's Lost, a television series chronicling the lives of plane crash survivors on a mysterious tropical island.Fordis, Jeff, (January 22, 2007) \\"ABC Studios Lost Show Description Lead Press Release Page,\\" ABC Medianet.

Retrieved on February 1, 2009. Charlie was a regular character in the first three seasons, and continued to make occasional appearances until the final season. Charlie is introduced as one of the main characters in the pilot episode. Flashbacks from the series show that prior to the plane crash, Charlie was a member of a rock band named Drive Shaft. Initially, Charlie battles with an addiction to heroin. He ultimately achieves sobriety, while establishing a romantic relationship with Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), and acting as a father figure to Claire's son Aaron. In addition, Charlie also develops close friendships with Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia), and Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick). In season three of the show, Charlie begins to face his inevitable death when fellow castaway Desmond repeatedly foresees Charlie's demise. In the season three finale \\"Through the Looking Glass\\", Charlie drowns at the hands of Mikhail Bakunin (Andrew Divoff), sacrificing himself in an effort to save the other survivors. Due to Lost's non-linear presentation of events and supernatural elements, Charlie makes several appearances in seasons four and six of the series. Charlie is prominent in the series finale, \\"The End\\". ==Character arcPrior to the crash=== Charlie was born in 1979 to Simon and Megan Pace, and lived in Manchester, England. When Charlie was young, he was given a piano as a gift on Christmas Day, thus beginning his career in music. Charlie honed his musical talents by playing on the street for money, where he spotted a woman being mugged and saved her, prompting her to call him a hero. Sometime later, Charlie and his brother Liam (Neil Hopkins) had formed a band called Drive Shaft, and landed a record deal. Suddenly, Drive Shaft became extremely popular for their song \\"You All Everybody\\", although they were a one-hit wonder. Liam, amidst their popularity and success, develops a drug habit and begins to neglect the band. On Christmas Day, while touring Finland, Liam gave Charlie a family heirloom (a ring inscribed with the initials D.S. in reference to Dexter Stratton, Charlie and Liam's great-grandfather, of whom the band was named after), saying because of his addiction he would never have a family so it should go to Charlie. Eventually, though, Charlie became addicted to heroin. As the band's fame began to decrease, Charlie sank further into his addiction. Liam sold his piano so he could enroll into rehabilitation after dropping his newborn daughter. Liam left Charlie alone, in order to be with his wife, Karen, and daughter, Megan (named after the brothers' mother). With Drive Shaft disbanded, Charlie resorted to theft in support of his heroin addiction. He charmed a wealthy woman, Lucy, in order to rob her, but she learned of his intentions and left him as he began to develop real feelings for her. Charlie then traveled to Australia to persuade a now-sober Liam to rejoin the band for a comeback tour. Liam refused, offering instead to help him enter a rehabilitation program, but Charlie angrily rebuked him and left to board a plane to Los Angeles scheduled for the next day. The night before the flight, he took heroin with a woman named Lily, who he fought with over the last of his stash until she left angrily. On the plane, he struggles without any heroin and goes to the bathroom to take some, when the plane begins to crash. ===After the crash=== On the second day on the island, he, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) venture inland to the plane's cockpit, where he retrieves his stash of heroin. John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) later discovers his addiction to heroin and in exchange for his guitar, Charlie gives up the drugs. After Jack is trapped in a cave-in, Charlie saves him. Afterwards, Charlie burns his drugs in a fire. When Charlie tries to stop Claire from going back to the beach, both are kidnapped by Ethan Rom (William Mapother). Pursuing him, Jack and Kate find Charlie hung from a tree almost dead. When Claire returns and Ethan comes to recapture her, Charlie kills the latter with a gun. When Claire goes into labour, Charlie, along with Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), helps Kate deliver the baby. When Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan) abducts the baby, named Aaron, Charlie and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) go to rescue him. Along the way, Charlie and Sayid stop by a Beechcraft carrying several Virgin Mary statues filled with heroin. That night, Charlie and Sayid manage to reclaim Aaron, and bring him safely back to Claire. In Season 2, Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) reveals to Claire the contents of the Virgin Mary statue, creating a rift between her and Charlie. Charlie takes Eko to the Beechcraft where he found them, and the two decide to burn the plane and its contents. However, Charlie secretly keeps a stash hidden in the jungle. Later, he begins experiencing surreal dreams, in which Aaron is in peril. He seeks out Eko, who says Aaron may need to be baptized. Subsequently, Charlie kidnaps Aaron and attempts to baptize him. When caught, Locke violently beats him. As retribution for Locke embarrassing him, Charlie aids James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway) in conning Jack and Locke out of the Hatch's guns and heroin by assaulting Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim). Later, Sayid tells Charlie about a prisoner in the Hatch, \\"Henry Gale\\" (Michael Emerson). They, along with Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez), attempt to find the balloon Henry allegedly crashed in. When the three return to the Hatch, they reveal Henry to be an impostor. After this, Charlie begins helping Eko build a church, but is angered when Eko abandons its construction. He finds a box of vaccine, and gives it to Claire for herself and Aaron, beginning to renew their friendship. In Sawyer's tent, Charlie discovers the remaining Virgin Mary statues, and throws them in the ocean. Eko seeks his help in finding the dynamite from the Black Rock ship. Charlie brings him to it, and he and Eko go to the Hatch, with Eko intending to blow open the blast door. After an explosion, Charlie barely escapes the Hatch as it implodes. After the Hatch's implosion, Charlie helps Locke standing guard while Locke communes with the island and helping him rescue Eko from a polar bear's cave. After Eko's death, Desmond starts having visions in which Charlie dies. Later, Charlie joins Desmond, Hurley and Jin on a hike into the jungle where they find a parachutist named Naomi Dorrit, who crashed on the island. When Jack announces his plan to foil the Others and contact the outside world, Charlie volunteers to swim down to the Looking Glass station and switch off a device blocking transmissions to and from the island. Desmond accompanies him. He confronts three people, two women who maintain the station and Mikhail. During a confrontation, Mikhail is shot in the chest with a spear gun. Just as Charlie is able to make contact with Penelope Widmore (Sonya Walger) in an adjacent communication room, a mysteriously resurrected Mikhail uses a grenade to destroy the room's porthole, flooding the communication room. To spare Desmond, Charlie locks the door from the inside, and warns him of Naomi's deception by writing on his hand 'Not Penny's Boat'. Charlie then drowns. After leaving the island, Hurley has visions of Charlie first at a convenience store, and then later at the asylum Hurley has been committed to. Charlie tells Hurley the people remaining on the island need him, and that he has to return, but disappears when Hurley closes his eyes. In \\"Something Nice Back Home\\", Hurley conveys to Jack a message from Charlie: \\"You're not supposed to raise him\\" (referring to Aaron, whom Kate and Jack have adopted). Hurley also tells Jack that, according to Charlie, Jack will also be visited. ===Afterlife=== In the episode \\"LA X\\", Charlie is seen on board Oceanic 815, in the restroom with heroin, as seen in the \\"Pilot\\" episode. However; during this \\"flash-sideways\\", flight 815 does not crash, and Charlie gets a small bag of heroin lodged in his throat, rendering him unconscious. He is revived by Jack and later arrested for possession of illegal drugs. He later claims, while he was unconscious, he had a vision of a \\"beautiful, rapturous\\" woman who is implied to be Claire. Glaring at Jack as he is restrained, he snarls \\"I was meant to die.\\" In the episode \\"Recon\\", Charlie's brother, Liam, was at a police station, the same one Sawyer and Miles work at, asking about Charlie. In the episode \\"Happily Ever After\\" Charlie is released from jail and greeted by Desmond Hume. Desmond has been tasked by his boss, Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), with bringing Charlie and his band Drive Shaft to play with Charles' son, Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies), at a charity concert. Desmond does not succeed since Charlie runs Desmond's car into the water, which triggers Desmond's memory of Charlie's death in the original timeline. Desmond escapes and rescues Charlie from the submerged vehicle. In the episode \\"The End\\", Charlie is tranquilized by Hurley in order to carry him to the concert which he was scheduled to perform. While on stage, he sees Claire sitting in the crowd and realizes she's the one he saw when he almost died. She seems to be flattered by his attention, but then has contractions and goes backstage with Kate. Charlie follows them and while he gets water and blankets, Claire gives birth and remembers her life on the island. Charlie returns and she recognizes him. She takes his hand and he then remembers everything too, and they have an emotional reunion. They are seen in the church along with the other main characters at the series' conclusion. ==Development== After appearing in The Lord of the Rings, Dominic Monaghan was offered many fantasy-based roles. He was keen to portray a different role, and wanted a contemporary part which had layers and an edge. Originally Charlie was an older rock musician who had been a big hit in the 1980s but had succumbed to heroin addiction. After the producers enjoyed Monaghan's audition for the character Sawyer, they rewrote the part to make him a younger one-hit wonder musician.\\"Before They Were Lost\\". Lost: The Complete First Season, Buena Vista Home Entertainment. September 6, 2005. Featurette, disc 7. Lynnette Porter, David Lavery, authors of Lost's Buried Treasures: The Unofficial Guide to Everything Lost Fans Need to Know, saw Charlie as a combination of Harold Emery Lauder and Larry Underwood, two characters from the Stephen King novel The Stand: Both were one-hit wonder guitarists and singers who used drugs, and both are heroes at the end. Charlie (Hieronymus) Pace is named after the Austrian theologian and historian Hieronymus Pez. This is in keeping with many of the characters in Lost who are named after famous philosophers and theologians, although the name Charlie Pace is also the name of one early member of the Branch Davidian sect that was raided in Waco, Texas in 1993. In a DVD commentary for \\"The Moth\\", Monaghan said he felt Charlie's black hoodie is some sort of \\"security blanket\\" that he hides underneath and uses when he feels \\"lost\\".Commentary for The Moth, Season 1 DVD In a Season One DVD featurette, \\"Backstage with Driveshaft\\", Dominic Monaghan cites several bands as a direct influence on the fictional band: Monaghan adds: At the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con, Dominic Monaghan returned and confirmed that he would be back in Lost's final season as Charlie Pace for three episodes. ==Reception== {class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:28em; max-width: 40%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\" style=\\"text-align: left;\\"\\"No longer are we observing the ex-rocker, the junky, the Laurel to Hurley's Hardy, now we are seeing Charlie as vulnerable and complex human being with a galvanized sense of what makes life worth living.\\" - style=\\"text-align: left;\\" ‚Äî Jon Lachonis regarding Charlie in \\"Greatest Hits\\" .Lachonis, Jon \\"DocArzt\\", (May 16, 2007) \\"3.21 'Greatest Hits' Recap \\", BuddyTV.

Contrastingly, in a list of the show's \\"10 Best Backstories\\", he was ranked 8th. A poll by E! Online named him as the character fans would most like to see return at 43.4% of the vote, more than 30 percentage points higher than his nearest rival.

Claire is introduced in the pilot episode as a pregnant crash survivor. She is a series regular until her mysterious disappearance in the fourth season finale. The character returned as a regular in the sixth season. ==Character biographyBefore the Crash=== Claire was raised in Sydney by her mother, Carole (Susan Duerden), who told her that her father had died. When she is a teenager, she and her mother are involved in a car accident which leaves Carole in a coma. Christian Shephard (John Terry) pays for Carole's medical care and reveals himself as Claire's father. When he suggests that Claire turn off her mother's life support, she is angry and leaves without learning his name. Years later, Claire becomes pregnant by her then-boyfriend, Thomas (Keir O'Donnell). He convinces her to keep the baby but leaves her a few months later. Claire considers giving the child up for adoption. She then visits a psychic, Richard Malkin (Nick Jameson), who insists she raise the child herself, because \\"danger surrounds this baby.\\" Scared by his vehemence, Claire says she plans to have the baby adopted. Claire begins to sign the document to finalize the adoption, but the pen runs out of ink; the lawyer hands her another and it too fails to work. Before she tries a third pen, Claire changes her mind and leaves the room. She visits Malkin a second time, and he tells her about a couple living in Los Angeles who are interested in adopting her baby. He gives Claire a ticket for Oceanic Flight 815, which is to leave the next day, insisting it has to be that flight ‚Äî and that flight only ‚Äî that she must take. Weeks later, Claire believes Malkin foresaw the plane crash, meaning she would have to raise her child herself. ===After the crash=== Season 1 Claire panics as she hasn't felt the baby move after the crash and is helped by Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox). She passes out from dehydration but when Jack tells them about some caves and a freshwater stream, Claire stays on the beach, claiming the move into the caves would be accepting their fate as long-term inhabitants. She bonds with survivor Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan). They grow closer and Charlie persuades her to move to the caves, where Claire has nightmares. She insists someone is trying to interfere with or hurt her unborn child, but Jack insists her nightmares are stress-related and tries to give her sedatives. Annoyed, Claire leaves the caves with Charlie but returns, wanting Jack there when she gives birth. On the way back, she and Charlie are kidnapped by Ethan Rom (William Mapother). Charlie is rescued, but Claire remained missing for nearly two weeks. John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) and Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) find Claire when she returns to the caves, suffering from amnesia. Ethan, however, demands Claire is returned to him, saying he will kill one survivor a day until he gets her back. The survivors keep this from Claire but she notices them treating her differently and eventually, Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) tells her about Ethan's threats when Claire demands an explanation. Against Charlie's wishes, Claire agrees to be bait to capture Ethan and Charlie kills him, later telling Jack that he wasn't going to let Ethan anywhere near Claire again and he deserved to die. Later, Locke seeks her help in making a cradle for her baby as a birthday gift. Days later, Claire has the baby, assisted by Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) and Charlie. Claire is initially unable to calm him but James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford's (Josh Holloway) Southern accent solves the problem. Initially, she doesn't name him, but after Rousseau kidnaps him, she names him Aaron, begging Charlie and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) to bring him back. She waits at the caves with Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) and Shannon until Charlie and Sayid return with him. Season 2 Claire continues to struggle with her amnesia, and is annoyed by Charlie's attempts to play an almost fatherly role to Aaron. She unburdens herself to Locke, and jokes Charlie could be a religious freak with his Virgin Mary statues. The statues were found in the wreckage of a plane crash, each filled with heroin. Later, Claire is confronted by Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), who tells her what was in the statues. Remembering Charlie mentioning his former drug addiction, she forbids him to approach her or Aaron. When Charlie steals Aaron, wanting to baptize him, Claire slaps him but later requests Eko baptize her and her son. Later, Aaron falls ill, prompting Claire to seek Libby Smith's (Cynthia Watros) expertise to help her unblock her repressed memories in order to find a cure. Remembering where Ethan took her, she and Kate head into the jungle to search for Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan). They return to the Dharma station, but find it abandoned. Before leaving, Claire tells Rousseau her daughter, Alex (Tania Raymonde), helped her and is still alive. Upon returning to the beach, Aaron is well and Claire has recovered all the lost memories from after her abduction by Ethan. Charlie later approaches Claire, and gives her some vaccine for her and Aaron, which she accepts. While at Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez) and Libby's funeral, Claire clasps Charlie's hand and later kisses him. Season 3 Days later, Claire sees a flock of gulls flying overhead. She believes if she can catch one, they could send a distress message to the outside world. She asks Sun and Jin to help build a net to catch one of the birds, but Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) thwarts their attempt when he scares the birds away with gunfire. Angry with him and Charlie, she follows Desmond to a rocky cliff, where he gives her a bird and learns of Desmond's visions of Charlie's death. She comforts Charlie, and the two attach a note to the bird before releasing it. Later, Claire suddenly falls violently ill, due to the now activated implant Ethan put in her during her abduction. Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) cures the illness as a means of earning the survivors' trust. When Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason) addresses the camp about the world's perspective of their predicament, Claire expresses outrage they are considered dead. Later, when Karl (Blake Bashoff) arrives the next day with news of the Others' impending arrival, Claire goes with the rest of the camp to the radio tower. Soon after, Claire is delighted to hear Charlie has disabled the jamming device blocking all outgoing signals, but is worried he has not returned to shore. Season 4 Claire and Sun tend to Aaron before heading back to the beach, following Jack's success in contacting the freighter. However, upon the two groups meeting by the cockpit, Claire learns of Charlie's death and his final warning. With this in mind, Claire decides to join Locke and move into the barracks, along with Hurley, Sawyer and three other unarmed castaways. Along the way, she and the rest of Locke's group encounter Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader), who had parachuted onto the island. Claire is asleep when the barracks fall under attack. One of Martin Keamy's (Kevin Durand) men shoots an RPG at Claire's house, which explodes, but she is rescued by Sawyer. Upon safely leaving the barracks and its attackers, Claire, Sawyer and Miles Straume (Ken Leung) return to the beach. Several times during the journey, Miles stares at Claire strangely, prompting Sawyer to issue an impromptu 'restraining order'. She falls asleep in their camp that night and wakes to find her father, Christian, holding Aaron, and proceeds to follow him, leaving Aaron under a tree in the process. Later, when Locke enters Jacob's cabin, he finds Claire sitting there with Christian, claiming she and Aaron are fine where they are. Before Locke leaves, Christian cautions him Claire's whereabouts should remain a secret. Aaron is one of the rescued Oceanic Six, and the general public are told he is Kate's son, while Claire is listed as among the passengers who did not survive the plane crash. At Christian Shephard's memorial service, Carole Littleton, who has recovered from her coma, tells Jack she and Christian had a relationship which produced Claire, revealing her to be Jack's half-sister. Eventually, before departing to return to the island, Kate reveals to Carole that Aaron is Claire's son. Kate tells Carole that she is going back to try to find Claire, and leaves Aaron with his grandmother. Season 6 On the Island, Dogen (Hiroyuki Sanada) tells Jack that Claire has been consumed by the same \\"infection\\" that threatens Sayid. At about the same time, Jin is attacked by men from the temple, and then rescued by Claire, who has adapted to an existence on the Island like Rousseau's. She tells Jin about a friend she now has on the island, the fake John Locke ‚Äî of whose falsity she is aware. Claire reveals that she's been searching for Aaron and believes the people in the Temple have him. Observing Claire's erratic behavior, Jin decides not to convince her otherwise. She therefore plans to invade the temple to find her son. The Man in Black then sends Claire to the Temple as an emissary for him to communicate with the Others' leader, Dogen. However, Dogen orders the Others to take Claire captive, so they put her in a large pit within the Temple. When Kate returns, she demands to see Claire and finds her there, singing \\"Catch a Falling Star\\". Kate reveals to Claire that she took and raised Aaron, but Claire is not happy about it. After the Monster's attack on the Temple, the pair escape and join the Man in Black and his new group of defected Others. As the Man in Black's party continues their journey, Claire attacks Kate. Their leader intervenes, stopping Claire violently. Claire later apologizes to Kate and thanks her for saving Aaron. Claire questions the Man in Black's intentions for her, expressing her fear that he doesn't need her to be on the plane on which he plans to escape. The Man in Black reassures her that he wants her to be reunited with her child. When asked about Kate, the Man in Black reveals that she is simply a means to an end. Claire later turns against and flees from the Man in Black after he allows Jin, Sun and Sayid to die on Charles Widmore's (Alan Dale) submarine. She becomes fearful of him and is hostile towards Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), Miles and Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) when she believes that they have been sent to kill her. They fail to convince her to accompany them off the Island as it collapses, owing to Desmond accidentally extinguishing the light in the source of the Island. When Kate and Sawyer arrive on Hydra Island and find her, Claire admits to shame of what she has become, and believes that Aaron is better off without her. Kate assures Claire that her worries are normal, and promises to help her. The trio board the plane with Richard, Frank and Miles and fly home. ===Afterlife=== Claire is the passenger in a taxi Kate Austen hijacks at gunpoint in order to escape Edward Mars (Fredric Lehne). When the driver runs from the taxi and Kate takes over as driver, she forces Claire to exit the vehicle and leave her belongings behind. Kate later regrets this and gives Claire a ride to the house of the couple who are adopting her baby. Claire asks Kate to come in with her, and finds out the couple has split up and the wife does not feel she can raise Claire's child alone. She then experiences contractions and Kate brings her to the hospital where she is treated by Dr. Goodspeed (Ethan Rom) He tells her at 36 weeks, she could deliver a healthy baby; however, because she does not feel she is ready, she chooses to be treated with drugs stabilizing her. When the baby's heartbeat momentarily cannot be found, Claire instinctively calls her child \\"Aaron.\\" In thanks for her assistance, Claire covers for Kate and gives her a credit card, enabling her to escape. Later, Desmond uses their acquaintance from the plane to send Claire to his lawyer, Ilana Verdansky, for adoption advice, knowing that Verdansky is executing Christian Shephard's last will and testament and is already looking for Claire, a named beneficiary. Jack Shephard and his mother also learn of Claire's existence through the will. When Jack and Claire meet, he immediately accepts her as family and brings her to stay with him and his son David (Dylan Minnette). Later on, Claire attends a concert with David. Desmond has brought Kate there, and Charlie's band Driveshaft is performing that night. Claire locks eyes with Charlie, and they both feel the first stirrings of recognition. She then goes into labour and gives birth backstage, being helped by Kate, just like before on the island. This reawakens Claire and Kate's memories of the island. After this, Charlie also remembers their lives on the island, and he and Claire have an emotional reunion. They are later seen at the church with everybody else as Christian opens the doors and allows them to move on. ==Development== The producers thought it was essential an Australian was cast for the part of Claire, as it was always planned to be a multi- cultural show, and the Oceanic 815 was leaving from Sydney. Emilie de Ravin was working in Edmonton, so she was unable to go to the auditions, which were being held in Los Angeles. From a video she sent to the producers, they were able to tell de Ravin had the youth and sweetness required for the role, but also looked as though she had some life experience.\\"Before They Were Lost\\". Lost: The Complete First Season, Buena Vista Home Entertainment. September 6, 2005. Featurette, disc 7. Emilie de Ravin, an Australian actress, Born in Sydney, Australia. She was originally auditioned for the role of Shannon, speaking her dialogue with an American accent. Instead, they offered her the part of Claire; she accepted without reading the script, assuming it would just be a recurring role. While de Ravin had never been pregnant, she was able to learn of the experience from her two older sisters. She found the hot weather conditions in Hawaii difficult, later saying that \\"in many ways, the filming is actually like the drama. You endure the muggiest weather in the rainforest... You're really exposed to the elements.\\" The actress admitted being \\"creeped out\\" by the premise of \\"Raised by Another\\", in which a psychic tricks Claire by sending her to the island to raise her baby. Emilie de Ravin did not return as a series regular for the fifth season, but had a \\"holding contract\\" and returned as a regular in the sixth season. ==References== Category:Lost (TV series) characters Category:Fictional people from New South Wales Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional victims of kidnapping Category:Fictional sole survivors Category:Female characters in television Category:Television characters introduced in 2004 ca:Personatges de Lost#Claire Littleton sv:Huvudroller i Lost#Claire Littleton ","title":"Claire Littleton"},{"id":"2230985","text":"Charles Brandle \\"Chuck\\" Crate (1916‚Äì1992) was a Canadian fascist who was the leader of the Canadian Union of Fascists. He later served in the Royal Canadian Navy and eventually became a teacher. == Early Years == Crate was born and grew up in northern Ontario, moving into a working-class district of Toronto in 1927. The poverty and unemployment brought by the Great Depression turned the young Crate into a radical, in his youth sympathizing with the then populist fascist movement of Europe. == Career == Crate was editor of The Thunderbolt in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in which he blamed the conditions of the time on Jews, the Roman Catholic Church and the Masonic Order. During the war, Chuck Crate joined the Royal Canadian Navy where he worked in Postal Service and as a gunner. He was based in Scotland where he met his future wife. Crate worked for many years after the World War II as a gold miner and Mine Mill and Smelter Worker shop steward and union organizer where he secured equal pay for Native Indian workers in the mines. During this time he met Charles Lovell and began a lifelong interest in Canadian English lexicography and Canadiana literature which later led to the publication of A Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles. A lifelong advocate for workers rights, Crate worked in and for numerous unions until he retired and became a member of the Co- operative Commonwealth Federation party. In Yellowknife, he was instrumental in starting the (Indian) Friendship Center as well a public library and started a local newspaper called the Northern Star. He was supportive of Canadian Indigenous peoples and worked personally and legally to support their rights. He represented the hereditary Dogrib chief Michel Siki in a groundbreaking case in support of Aboriginal Hunting Rights, until the level of the Supreme Court. Mr. Crate later became a teacher and taught and lived in numerous small Canadian towns and on the Blackfoot reserve. He taught mainly Business English, Literature and Socials Studies, which he augmented by his research and teaching of Native Indian history. He donated some of his collection of old Canadiana literature and Dictionaries to the libraries in each small town he lived in. Crate was known for his defence of those who kept views considered to be ‚Äòinflammatory‚Äô. Among the more controversial aspect of this was speaking out in defence of Eastern European immigrants who either expressed inflammatory views of World War II or possibly had been accused of regarding World War II war crimes. == Death == He died in 1992 at the age of 76 and is survived by two daughters and a son born to his second wife which he willed to be named Hitler. ==References== Category:Canadian collaborators with Nazi Germany Category:Canadian fascists Category:1916 births Category:1992 deaths ","title":"Chuck Crate"},{"id":"2230989","text":"The Kuiper Airborne Observatory took an infrared image of the underside of Columbia during the reentry of STS-3 to study temperatures. The orbiter was high and travelling at Mach 15.6. Space Shuttle Discovery as it approaches the International Space Station during the STS-114 on 28 July 2005. The Space Shuttle thermal protection system (TPS) is the barrier that protected the Space Shuttle Orbiter during the searing heat of atmospheric reentry. A secondary goal was to protect from the heat and cold of space while in orbit. ==Materials== Thermal protection system for orbiter 103 and subsequent orbiters Endeavour in a museum, showing tiles near door The TPS covered essentially the entire orbiter surface, and consisted of seven different materials in varying locations based on amount of required heat protection: * Reinforced carbon‚Äìcarbon (RCC), used in the nose cap, the chin area between the nose cap and nose landing gear doors, the arrowhead aft of the nose landing gear door, and the wing leading edges. Used where reentry temperature exceeded . * High-temperature reusable surface insulation (HRSI) tiles, used on the orbiter underside. Made of coated LI-900 silica ceramics. Used where reentry temperature was below 1,260 ¬∞C. * Fibrous refractory composite insulation (FRCI) tiles, used to provide improved strength, durability, resistance to coating cracking and weight reduction. Some HRSI tiles were replaced by this type. * Flexible Insulation Blankets (FIB), a quilted, flexible blanket-like surface insulation. Used where reentry temperature was below . * Low-temperature Reusable Surface Insulation (LRSI) tiles, formerly used on the upper fuselage, but were mostly replaced by FIB. Used in temperature ranges roughly similar to FIB. * Toughened unipiece fibrous insulation (TUFI) tiles, a stronger, tougher tile which came into use in 1996. Used in high and low temperature areas. * Felt reusable surface insulation (FRSI). White Nomex felt blankets on the upper payload bay doors, portions of the mid fuselage and aft fuselage sides, portions of the upper wing surface and a portion of the OMS/RCS pods. Used where temperatures stayed below . Each type of TPS had specific heat protection, impact resistance, and weight characteristics, which determined the locations where it was used and the amount used. The shuttle TPS has three key characteristics that distinguish it from the TPS used on previous spacecraft: ; Reusable: Previous spacecraft generally used ablative heat shields which burned off during reentry and so couldn't be reused. This insulation was robust and reliable, and the single- use nature was appropriate for a single-use vehicle. By contrast, the reusable shuttle required a reusable thermal protection system. ; Lightweight: Previous ablative heat shields were very heavy. For example, the ablative heat shield on the Apollo Command Module comprised about 15% of the vehicle weight. The winged shuttle had much more surface area than previous spacecraft, so a lightweight TPS was crucial. ; Fragile: The only known technology in the early 1970s with the required thermal and weight characteristics was also so fragile, due to the very low density, that one could easily crush a TPS tile by hand. ==Purpose== Discovery's under wing surfaces are protected by thousands of High-Temperature Reusable Insulation tiles. The orbiter's aluminum structure could not withstand temperatures over without structural failure. Aerodynamic heating during reentry would push the temperature well above this level in areas, so an effective insulator was needed. ===Reentry heating=== A closer view of the tiles under the forward fuselage and the front end of the left wing. The corner of the nose-gear door can be seen at the lower left. The dark solid black tiles are new ones which have yet to go through a reentry. (At top, the white object is the open left cargo bay door.)Reentry heating differs from the normal atmospheric heating associated with jet aircraft, and this governed TPS design and characteristics. The skin of high-speed jet aircraft can also become hot, but this is from frictional heating due to atmospheric friction, similar to warming one's hands by rubbing them together. The orbiter reentered the atmosphere as a blunt body by having a very high (40¬∞) angle of attack, with its broad lower surface facing the direction of flight. Over 80% of the heating the orbiter experiences during reentry is caused by compression of the air ahead of the hypersonic vehicle, in accordance with the basic thermodynamic relation between pressure and temperature. A hot shock wave was created in front of the vehicle, which deflected most of the heat and prevented the orbiter's surface from directly contacting the peak heat. Therefore, reentry heating was largely convective heat transfer between the shock wave and the orbiter's skin through superheated plasma. The key to a reusable shield against this type of heating is very low-density material, similar to how a thermos bottle inhibits convective heat transfer. Some high-temperature metal alloys can withstand reentry heat; they simply get hot and re-radiate the absorbed heat. This technique, called heat sink thermal protection, was planned for the X-20 Dyna- Soar winged space vehicle. However, the amount of high-temperature metal required to protect a large vehicle like the Space Shuttle Orbiter would have been very heavy and entailed a severe penalty to the vehicle's performance. Similarly, ablative TPS would be heavy, possibly disturb vehicle aerodynamics as it burned off during reentry, and require significant maintenance to reapply after each mission. (Unfortunately, TPS tile, which was originally specified never to take debris strikes during launch, in practice also needed to be closely inspected and repaired after each landing, due to damage invariably incurred during ascent, even before new on-orbit inspection policies were established following the loss of Space Shuttle Columbia.) == Detailed description == Silica tile from Atlantis The TPS was a system of different protection types, not just silica tiles. They are in two basic categories: tile TPS and non-tile TPS. The main selection criteria used the lightest weight protection capable of handling the heat in a given area. However, in some cases a heavier type was used if additional impact resistance was needed. The FIB blankets were primarily adopted for reduced maintenance, not for thermal or weight reasons. Much of the shuttle was covered with LI-900 silica tiles, made from essentially very pure quartz sand. The insulation prevented heat transfer to the underlying orbiter aluminum skin and structure. These tiles were such poor heat conductors that one could hold one by the edges while it was still red hot. There were about 24,300 unique tiles individually fitted on the vehicle, for which the orbiter has been called \\"the flying brickyard\\". Researchers at University of Minnesota and Pennsylvania State University are performing the atomistic simulations to obtain accurate description of interactions between atomic and molecular oxygen with silica surfaces to develop better high-temperature oxidation-protection systems for leading edges on hypersonic vehicles. The tiles were not mechanically fastened to the vehicle, but glued. Since the brittle tiles could not flex with the underlying vehicle skin, they were glued to Nomex felt Strain Isolation Pads (SIPs) with room temperature vulcanizing (RTV) silicone adhesive, which were in turn glued to the orbiter skin. These isolated the tiles from the orbiter's structural deflections and expansions. ===Tile types=== High-temperature reusable surface insulation (HRSI) An HRSI tile. Note the yellow markings, which denote its exact location on the orbiter. The black HRSI tiles provided protection against temperatures up to . There were 20,548 HRSI tiles which covered the landing gear doors, external tank umbilical connection doors, and the rest of the orbiter's under surfaces. They were also used in areas on the upper forward fuselage, parts of the orbital maneuvering system pods, vertical stabilizer leading edge, elevon trailing edges, and upper body flap surface. They varied in thickness from , depending upon the heat load encountered during reentry. Except for closeout areas, these tiles were normally square. The HRSI tile was composed of high purity silica fibers. Ninety percent of the volume of the tile was empty space, giving it a very low density () making it light enough for spaceflight. The uncoated tiles were bright white in appearance and looked more like a solid ceramic than the foam-like material that they were. The black coating on the tiles was Reaction Cured Glass (RCG) of which tetrasilicide and borosilicate glass were some of several ingredients. RCG was applied to all but one side of the tile to protect the porous silica and to increase the heat sink properties. The coating was absent from a small margin of the sides adjacent to the uncoated (bottom) side. To waterproof the tile, dimethylethoxysilane was injected into the tiles by syringe. Densifying the tile with tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) also helped to protect the silica and added additional waterproofing. Diagram of a HRSI tile. An uncoated HRSI tile held in the hand feels like a very light foam, less dense than styrofoam, and the delicate, friable material must be handled with extreme care to prevent damage. The coating feels like a thin, hard shell and encapsulates the white insulating ceramic to resolve its friability, except on the uncoated side. Even a coated tile feels very light, lighter than a same-sized block of styrofoam. As expected for silica, they are odorless and inert. HRSI was primarily designed to withstand transition from areas of extremely low temperature (the void of space, about ) to the high temperatures of re-entry (caused by interaction, mostly compression at the hypersonic shock, between the gases of the upper atmosphere & the hull of the Space Shuttle, typically around ). Fibrous Refractory Composite Insulation Tiles (FRCI) The black FRCI tiles provided improved durability, resistance to coating cracking and weight reduction. Some HRSI tiles were replaced by this type. Toughened unipiece fibrous insulation (TUFI) A stronger, tougher tile which came into use in 1996. TUFI tiles came in high temperature black versions for use in the orbiter's underside, and lower temperature white versions for use on the upper body. While more impact resistant than other tiles, white versions conducted more heat which limited their use to the orbiter's upper body flap and main engine area. Black versions had sufficient heat insulation for the orbiter underside but had greater weight. These factors restricted their use to specific areas. Low-temperature reusable surface insulation (LRSI) White in color, these covered the upper wing near the leading edge. They were also used in selected areas of the forward, mid, and aft fuselage, vertical tail, and the OMS/RCS pods. These tiles protected areas where reentry temperatures are below . The LRSI tiles were manufactured in the same manner as the HRSI tiles, except that the tiles were square and had a white RCG coating made of silica compounds with shiny aluminum oxide. The white color was by design and helped to manage heat on orbit when the orbiter was exposed to direct sunlight. These tiles were reusable for up to 100 missions with refurbishment (100 missions was also the design lifetime of each orbiter). They were carefully inspected in the Orbiter Processing Facility after each mission, and damaged or worn tiles were immediately replaced before the next mission. Fabric sheets known as gap fillers were also inserted between tiles where necessary. These allowed for a snug fit between tiles, preventing excess plasma from penetrating between them, yet allowing for thermal expansion and flexing of the underlying vehicle skin. Prior to the introduction of FIB blankets, LRSI tiles occupied all of the areas now covered by the blankets, including the upper fuselage and the whole surface of the OMS pods. This TPS configuration was only used on Columbia and Challenger. ===Non-tile TPS=== Flexible Insulation Blankets/Advanced Flexible Reusable Insulation (FIB/AFRSI) Developed after the initial delivery of Columbia and first used on the OMS pods of Challenger. This white low-density fibrous silica batting material had a quilt-like appearance, and replaced the vast majority of the LRSI tiles. They required much less maintenance than LRSI tiles yet had about the same thermal properties. After their limited use on Challenger, they were used much more extensively beginning with Discovery and replaced many of the LRSI tiles on Columbia after the loss of Challenger. Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) The light gray material which withstood reentry temperatures up to protected the wing leading edges and nose cap. Each of the orbiters' wings had 22 RCC panels about thick. T-seals between each panel allowed for thermal expansion and lateral movement between these panels and the wing. RCC was a laminated composite material made from carbon fibres impregnated with a phenolic resin. After curing at high temperature in an autoclave, the laminate was pyrolized to convert the resin to pure carbon. This was then impregnated with furfural alcohol in a vacuum chamber, then cured and pyrolized again to convert the furfural alcohol to carbon. This process was repeated three times until the desired carbon-carbon properties were achieved. To provide oxidation resistance for reuse capability, the outer layers of the RCC were coated with silicon carbide. The silicon-carbide coating protected the carbon-carbon from oxidation. The RCC was highly resistant to fatigue loading that was experienced during ascent and entry. It was stronger than the tiles and was also used around the socket of the forward attach point of the orbiter to the External Tank to accommodate the shock loads of the explosive bolt detonation. RCC was the only TPS material that also served as structural support for part of the orbiter's aerodynamic shape: the wing leading edges and the nose cap. All other TPS components (tiles and blankets) were mounted onto structural materials that supported them, mainly the aluminum frame and skin of the orbiter. Nomex Felt Reusable Surface Insulation (FRSI) This white, flexible fabric offered protection at up to . FRSI covered the orbiter's upper wing surfaces, upper payload bay doors, portions of the OMS/RCS pods, and aft fuselage. Gap fillers Gap fillers were placed at doors and moving surfaces to minimize heating by preventing the formation of vortices. Doors and moving surfaces created open gaps in the heat protection system that had to be protected from heat. Some of these gaps were safe, but there were some areas on the heat shield where surface pressure gradients caused a crossflow of boundary layer air in those gaps. The filler materials were made of either white AB312 fibers or black AB312 cloth covers (which contain alumina fibers). These materials were used around the leading edge of the nose cap, windshields, side hatch, wing, trailing edge of elevons, vertical stabilizer, the rudder/speed brake, body flap, and heat shield of the shuttle's main engines. On STS-114, some of this material was dislodged and determined to pose a potential safety risk. It was possible that the gap filler could cause turbulent airflow further down the fuselage, which would result in much higher heating, potentially damaging the orbiter. The cloth was removed during a spacewalk during the mission. ===Weight considerations=== While reinforced carbon‚Äìcarbon had the best heat protection characteristics, it was also much heavier than the silica tiles and FIBs, so it was limited to relatively small areas. In general the goal was to use the lightest weight insulation consistent with the required thermal protection. Density of each TPS type: {  - ! rowspan=2  Material ! colspan=2  Density - ! (kg/m¬≥) !

Tiles often fell off and caused much of the delay in the launch of STS-1, the first shuttle mission, which was originally scheduled for 1979 but did not occur until April 1981. NASA was unused to lengthy delays in its programs, and was under great pressure from the government and military to launch soon. In March 1979 it moved the incomplete Columbia, with 7,800 of the 31,000 tiles missing, from the Rockwell International plant in Palmdale, California to Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Beyond creating the appearance of progress in the program, NASA hoped that the tiling could be finished while the rest of the orbiter was prepared. This was a mistake; some of the Rockwell tilers disliked Florida and soon returned to California, and the Orbiter Processing Facility was not designed for manufacturing and was too small for its 400 workers. Each tile used cement that required 16 hours to cure. After the tile was affixed to the cement, a jack held it in place for another 16 hours. In March 1979 it took each worker 40 hours to install one tile; by using young, efficient college students during the summer the pace sped up to 1.8 tiles per worker per week. Thousands of tiles failed stress tests and had to be replaced. By fall NASA realized that the speed of tiling would determine the launch date. The tiles were so problematic that officials would have switched to any other thermal protection method, but none other existed. Because it had to be ferried without all tiles the gaps were filled with material to maintain the Shuttle's aerodynamics while in transit. ===Concern over \\"zipper effect\\"=== The tile TPS was an area of concern during shuttle development, mainly concerning adhesion reliability. Some engineers thought a failure mode could exist whereby one tile could detach, and resulting aerodynamic pressure would create a \\"zipper effect\\" stripping off other tiles. Whether during ascent or reentry, the result would be disastrous. ===Concern over debris strikes=== Another problem was ice or other debris impacting the tiles during ascent. This had never been fully and thoroughly solved, as the debris had never been eliminated, and the tiles remained susceptible to damage from it. NASA's final strategy for mitigating this problem was to aggressively inspect for, assess, and address any damage that may occur, while on orbit and before reentry, in addition to on the ground between flights. ===Early tile repair plans=== These concerns were sufficiently great that NASA did significant work developing an emergency-use tile repair kit which the STS-1 crew could use before deorbiting. By December 1979, prototypes and early procedures were completed, most of which involved equipping the astronauts with a special in-space repair kit and a jet pack called the Manned Maneuvering Unit, or MMU, developed by Martin Marietta. Another element was a maneuverable work platform which would secure an MMU-propelled spacewalking astronaut to the fragile tiles beneath the orbiter. The concept used electrically-controlled adhesive cups which would lock the work platform into position on the featureless tile surface. About one year before the 1981 STS-1 launch, NASA decided the repair capability was not worth the additional risk and training, so discontinued development.Houston Chronicle, March 9, 2003 There were unresolved problems with the repair tools and techniques; also further tests indicated the tiles were unlikely to come off. The first shuttle mission did suffer several tile losses, but they were in non-critical areas, and no \\"zipper effect\\" occurred. ==Columbia accident and aftermath== On February 1, 2003, the Space Shuttle Columbia was destroyed on reentry due to a failure of the TPS. The investigation team found and reported that the probable cause of the accident was that during launch, a piece of foam debris punctured an RCC panel on the left wing's leading edge and allowed hot gases from the reentry to enter the wing and disintegrate the wing from within, leading to eventual loss of control and breakup of the shuttle. The Space Shuttle's thermal protection system received a number of controls and modifications after the disaster. They were applied to the three remaining shuttles, Discovery, Atlantis and Endeavour in preparation for subsequent mission launches into space. On 2005's STS-114 mission, in which Discovery made the first flight to follow the Columbia accident, NASA took a number of steps to verify that the TPS was undamaged. The Orbiter Boom Sensor System, a new extension to the Remote Manipulator System, was used to perform laser imaging of the TPS to inspect for damage. Prior to docking with the International Space Station, Discovery performed a Rendezvous Pitch Maneuver, simply a 360¬∞ backflip rotation, allowing all areas of the vehicle to be photographed from ISS. Two gap fillers were protruding from the orbiter's underside more than the nominally allowed distance, and the agency cautiously decided it would be best to attempt to remove the fillers or cut them flush rather than risk the increased heating they would cause. Even though each one protruded less than , it was believed that leaving them could cause heating increases of 25% upon reentry. Because the orbiter did not have any handholds on its underside (as they would cause much more trouble with reentry heating than the protruding gap fillers of concern), astronaut Stephen K. Robinson worked from the ISS's robotic arm, Canadarm2. Because the TPS tiles were quite fragile, there had been concern that anyone working under the vehicle could cause more damage to the vehicle than was already there, but NASA officials felt that leaving the gap fillers alone was a greater risk. In the event, Robinson was able to pull the gap fillers free by hand, and caused no damage to the TPS on Discovery. ==Tile donations== , with the impending Space Shuttle retirement, NASA is donating TPS tiles to schools, universities, and museums for the cost of shipping -- US$23.40 each. About 7000 tiles were available on a first-come, first-served basis, but limited to one each per institution. == See also == * Space Shuttle program * Space Shuttle Columbia disaster * Columbia Accident Investigation Board == References == *\\"When the Space Shuttle finally flies\\", article written by Rick Gore.

Lost follows the journey of the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 on a mysterious island and their attempts to survive and escape, slowly uncovering more of the much broader island history they are a part of. The character was originally conceived by creator J. J. Abrams, though the direction of storylines owes more to co-creator Damon Lindelof and fellow showrunner Carlton Cuse. Abrams, the creator of Lost, once told Entertainment Weekly, \\"Jack Shephard may be the greatest leader in any television series.\\" Actor Matthew Fox would have some influence on the character during the course of the series' production. For example, Fox's own tattoos were incorporated into the character's backstory. Although at an early stage in the show's development, the character was originally intended to die in the pilot, the writers soon changed this plan, and Jack became the show's main character from its pilot episode onwards. The de facto leader of the crash survivors, in the show's first four seasons, Jack is very much a man of science. He serves as the antithesis of man of faith John Locke; however, his experiences in season five mold Jack into a believer, to the point of becoming John Locke's spiritual successor in the final season. His leadership role culminates in him taking briefly over as protector of the island from its immortal guardian, Jacob, and being the one to engage one of the series' villains, the Man in Black (who has ironically taken on Locke's appearance), in a climactic battle to the death. Jack's storylines have included the exploration of his relationships with various love interests: fellow survivor Kate Austen, and Juliet Burke, who is initially a member of the mysterious Others, who are the series' visible antagonists for the majority of its run. Other key relationships in the show involve Claire Littleton, whom he discovers is his half-sister; Hurley as his right-hand man; and Sawyer, his rival for the affections of Kate, even when at some points, Sawyer calls him the nearest thing he has as a friend. == Characterization == Prior to the crash of Oceanic Flight 815, Jack was born into a successful family, with aspirations of following in his father's footsteps. He attended Columbia University and graduated from medical school a year earlier than his classmates. Despite Jack's gifts as a physician, he is haunted by his relationship with his father, a neurosurgeon at St. Sebastian Hospital. Jack exposes his father's alcoholism, ending his career. In September 2004, Jack's mother, Margo, (Veronica Hamel) orders him to find Christian, who has exiled himself to Australia, and bring him back. Jack goes to Sydney and finds that his father has died. Once Jack identified his father's body, he made arrangements to bring him home. Jack boards Oceanic 815 bound for Los Angeles on September 22, 2004, with his father's casket in the cargo hold. On the island, Jack plays a key role in the survival of his fellow survivors in the immediate aftermath of the crash, instructing others to help those with injuries and using his medical background to assist the wounded. The survivors look to Jack as their leader; however, he is reluctant to embrace the position and repeats his father's rationale that he does not \\"have what it takes\\". Exhausted from tending the wounded, attempts to rescue drowning survivors and sleep-deprived, Jack begins chasing hallucinations of his father in the jungle. He drops his skepticism when he finds his father's coffin but it is empty. Struggling to cope with demands made by the castaways, he meets John Locke in the jungle, who provides some guidance for Jack's leadership. Jack returns to the beach camp and gives a speech on how they are going to live on the island and tells them about the caves; one part of his speech‚Äî\\"live together, die alone\\"‚Äîbecomes a mantra amongst the survivors. Through his medical tending and visibility within the camp, Jack quickly develops many personal relationships with the castaways, most notably finding a romantic interest in Kate Austen, a right-hand man in Hurley Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and a mutual respect for former military torturer Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews). Throughout the series, it has been stated numerous times that Jack is a natural leader. These things have been demonstrated many times by his ability to think quickly and analyze crisis situations. Jack intentionally represses fear and anxiety, usually in order to remain strong for other people, as he is the one they turn to during crises. Initially, he rejects claims of fellow survivors, such as Rose Nadler (L. Scott Caldwell) and John Locke, who believe they are on the Island for a reason and that the Island has mystic properties. He does this to not give his fellow survivors false hope. On the Island, Jack also seems to repress his feelings for Kate Austen. However, after escaping from The Island, Jack and Kate admit their love, move in together, and raise Aaron, Claire's son. Jack's habit of repression sometimes does flare out, usually in his propensity to become violent when he is enraged. He is also prone to become highly obsessive and willing to do anything to help the survivors, even if it's to his detriment. This aspect was noted by his father when he was a child, suggesting that Jack avoid being a hero because he doesn't have \\"what it takes\\" to keep a level head when things go wrong. Jack is, deep down, a very caring person and has sacrificed himself for his crash- mates several times. After being rescued, he sinks into alcoholism and drug abuse out of severe depression. He blames himself for leaving almost all the fellow survivors behind while he was safely rescued. This leads to his delusions that his father is still alive and a suicide attempt, which indicate that Jack has not been completely able to cope with what happened on the island. Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones marked a \\"difference in the characterization of Jack [who] has become known as the trustworthy, honest type since Oceanic Flight 815 crashed, so his blatant lies about the island under oath were definitely dramatic\\".Rawson-Jones, Ben, (February 24, 2008) \\"S04E04: 'Eggtown'\\", Digital Spy. Retrieved on June 16, 2008. After being rescued and falling into depression, Jack was visited by Locke one last time, to convince him to return to the island. Though he failed, Jack's outlook underwent a fundamental change. He began to believe in fate and destiny. When Juliet asked Jack why he eventually did return to the island, Jack told her \\"because I was supposed to\\". Jack's faith leads him to sacrifice himself to prevent the island's destruction. He believed that saving the island was what he was \\"meant to do\\" and the only thing that could give him the peace he did not find when he was off-island. == Development == In the original outline of Lost, Jack was going to be killed halfway through the first episode. Lost co- creator J. J. Abrams was interested in Michael Keaton for the role, as Abrams wanted to work with him. However, scripts were never even sent to him, as the character was made into a regular, and Keaton wasn't interested in a series. The producers felt that if the audience became attached to the character during the first episode, and then he was killed, they might resent the show. His death was meant to shock the audience so they would never know what would happen next. The role ended up going to Matthew Fox, who was \\"very excited\\" about it, as it was the genre and tone he was looking for.\\"Before They Were Lost\\".

According to Assistant Professor Xinping Zhu of Northeastern University, the tattoo is made up of four Chinese characters (; \\"Èπ∞\\", hawk; \\"Âáª\\", strike or attack; \\"Èïø\\", long; \\"Á©∫\\", space or sky) from a poem written by Mao Zedong in 1925, and the Lebanese Phalangist symbol. Fox's tattoo translates to \\"Eagles high up, cleaving the space\\". In an interview, Fox said that, for him, getting a tattoo is a \\"pretty intense experience\\" and something he would not do in the \\"spur of the moment\\". He thought it was a \\"really cool idea\\" for Jack to have tattoos. Since Fox used tattoos to represent memories or meaningful events in his life, the writers took a similar approach when dealing with Jack's tattoos. == Reception == Critical and viewer opinion has been positive for Matthew Fox's Jack Shephard.

At an early age Kate's parents divorced, and Diane married an abusive alcoholic named Wayne Janssen (James Horan). As an adult, Kate killed Wayne, which she confessed to her mother before disappearing. Wayne had always been abusive to her mother, but Kate decided to kill him upon learning that he was her biological father. Diane called the authorities; thereafter Kate is pursued and ultimately arrested by Edward Mars (Fredric Lehne). Kate fled to Miami under the alias \\"Monica\\", where she dated and soon married a police officer named Kevin Callis (Nathan Fillion). After a pregnancy scare and Kevin's purchase of two Oceanic tickets to Costa Rica for their honeymoon, Kate confessed her fugitive past and laced his drink with a sedative before disappearing. After months of traveling around the country under numerous aliases, Kate learned that Diane was dying of cancer, and decided to visit her. She reunited with her high-school sweetheart, Dr. Tom Brennan (Mackenzie Astin), who arranged a meeting between Kate and Diane. As Kate tried to apologize to her, Diane started screaming for help, prompting Kate to flee the hospital with Tom. A policeman opened fire on their getaway car, killing Tom and forcing Kate to flee the scene of the accident. Months later Kate staged a robbery in New Mexico with several criminals to infiltrate a bank's safe deposit box. Tom's toy airplane was being stored in box 815, the same number as the crashed flight number. She fled to Australia where, while sleeping in a barn, she was discovered by a farmer, Ray Mullens (Nick Tate). Posing as a Canadian hiker, Kate worked on the farm for three months. When the farmer caught her attempting to sneak away, he offered her a ride into town the next morning. During the journey however, Kate discovered that the farmer had found out her true identity and notified Edward Mars of her whereabouts. Kate grabbed the wheel and crashed the truck into a field but instead of running, she helped the unconscious farmer from his vehicle, giving Mars time to pursue and arrest her. Escorting her to the airport in handcuffs, Mars briefed local security officers on Kate's fugitive past and revealed his locked carry-on case containing four firearms (and a fifth in an ankle holster). As the plane was bombarded with escalating turbulence, Mars was knocked unconscious by luggage from the overhead compartment. Kate stole the keys to the handcuffs and attached an oxygen mask to Mars and for herself, as the plane splintered and crashed onto the island. ===After the crash=== Season 1 Having survived the crash, Jack Shephard noticed Kate walking out of the jungle and asked her to stitch his wound, to which she agreed reluctantly. During their second day on the Island, Jack, Kate and Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) went to retrieve the cockpit's transceiver from the plane debris. They tried to rescue the injured pilot, but the Smoke Monster attacked them. When they returned, Kate, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) and several other survivors hiked to higher ground of the Island to transmit a distress signal on the transceiver. Back at the camp, Kate visited the injured marshal where he attempted to strangle her. Kate told Jack that he should euthanize the dying man, but Jack questioned her true motives when he learned about her criminal record. She went on a mission to triangulate the distress signal, and helped an injured Michael Dawson back to the camp. Jack suggested that the survivors move to the caves that he had discovered, but Kate refused because she was afraid of \\"digging in\\" and settling down. When Kate discovered the marshal's case, she and Sawyer had several fights to possess it. Eventually, Kate asked Jack for his help; he retrieved the case and decided that he should open it with Kate. Inside the case was Tom's toy plane. Jack questioned her about the toy, and she admitted the plane belonged to the man that she loved and killed. Kate, along with Jack, attempted to track down Claire and Charlie when they were kidnapped by Ethan. They were able to find and revive a hanging Charlie. Later, she helped to capture Ethan. Kate was forced to deliver Claire's baby by herself while Jack was trying to save Boone's life. Kate tried to gain a place on Michael's raft by attempting to steal Sawyer's and Jin's places. She convinced Jin's wife, Sun, to poison his water to ensure that he would not be able to travel on the raft. In preparation for the trip, Kate stole a dead woman's passport to assume her identity. However, Michael accused Sawyer of Michael's poisoning, which led to Sawyer revealing her fugitive status to the other survivors. After Rousseau arrived on the beach to warn the camp of the Others' imminent arrival; she directed Kate, Jack, Locke, and Hurley to the Black Rock, where they attempted to carry dynamite to the hatch that was discovered in the jungle. Season 2 Kate and Locke descend into the hatch, Kate entering first. Once inside, she is locked up by Desmond. Kate arrives in a room with a computer, where she overpowers Desmond after Jack arrives. She accidentally damages the computer in the crossfire, causing Desmond to panic and flee. Kate is placed on a rotation to enter a certain set of numbers every 108 minutes into the computer, supposedly saving the world. While picking fruit Kate sees a black horse from her past. When she returns to the hatch she hallucinates that Wayne is channeled through unconscious injured Sawyer and Kate freaks out. Jack finds her alone in the jungle and tries to comfort her. Kate kisses Jack on impulse, then runs away once she realizes what she's done. She eventually returns to the Hatch to tend Sawyer. They venture outside and both witness the black horse lingering nearby. When Michael runs off in search of his son, Kate follows him, but is kidnapped. After Jack refuses Tom's demands to hand over the guns, Kate is brought out and held at gunpoint to force the men to give up their guns. When Claire's baby falls ill, Kate joins her on a trek into the jungle to seek Rousseau's help. The three head inland, where they discover the Staff station. Later, Kate and Jack discover a mysterious and unnoticed food drop in the jungle. They return to the hatch, where hostage \\"Henry Gale\\" is exposed as an impostor. Later, Kate joins Jack on a trek back to where they encountered the Others. The two make camp and Kate apologizes for kissing him in the jungle. Jack tells her that he is not sorry that she kissed him and they are about to kiss again when an exhausted Michael stumbles out of the bushes. Michael invites her to follow him to the Others' camp when he recovers. The next day, Kate, Jack, Sawyer and Hurley join Michael Dawson as they head for the Others' camp. They are ambushed, gagged, tied up and taken to a pier. Season 3 Kate is placed in a cage opposite Sawyer to work for the Others, under the eye of Pickett. Sawyer discovers they are actually on another island, and tries to keep the information from Kate so as to give her hope. When Jack contacts her via Pickett's radio, informing her that she has a head-start to escape, she and Sawyer run towards the beach. They encounter Alex, who gives them her boat When arriving on the beach, she scolds Sayid and Locke for not bothering to rescue Jack. They head into the jungle and find Rousseau, who agrees to help them after learning of Alex's status. The four trek into the jungle, where they discover the Flame station. There they confront the Other Mikhail and take him hostage. The four resume their hike, eventually arriving at the Others' barracks, and see Jack socializing with the Others. That evening, Kate approaches Jack, but the Others capture Sayid and her. When they are alone, Jack explains to Kate that he has made a deal with The Others. In exchange for saving Ben's life, Jack will be allowed to return home. He promises Kate that he will come back for her and the rest of their friends. But Locke blows up the Other's submarine before Jack can leave. The following day, Kate is gassed by the Others and wakes up in the jungle, handcuffed to Juliet. They eventually return to the beach with Jack and Sayid. Upon returning, Kate is still wary of Juliet, and becomes especially jealous of Juliet's developing relationship with Jack. Later, she learns of Naomi's arrival. Kate is then shown Jack and Juliet's plan to deal with the Others' imminent attack while the majority travels to the radio tower. En route, Sawyer tells Kate that he's turning back to help the survivors on the beach. Kate wants to go with him, but Sawyer won't let her, and Jack defends Sawyer's actions, knowing that Sawyer is trying to protect Kate. When Kate asks why he is sticking up for Sawyer because she knows Sawyer would never stick up for Jack, Jack replies that it's because he (Jack) loves her. They eventually encounter Ben and Alex in the jungle, at which point Ben is taken hostage. Season 4 Kate follows a trail of Naomi's blood until being attacked by Naomi, who suddenly dies. After a confrontation between Jack and Locke, Kate decides to stay with Jack, but questions Sawyer when he decides to go with Locke. Later, they come across Daniel Faraday, whom they believe has arrived to rescue them. After finding Miles, Kate and Jack find themselves at gunpoint until she takes them to Naomi's body. Later, they team up with Frank, who managed to arrive on the island with the helicopter. Upon learning of the location of the final team member, Charlotte Staples Lewis, Kate accompanies Sayid and Miles to the barracks. They are eventually captured by Locke. Kate decides to remain at the barracks, in an attempt to extract information from Miles. She arranges for him to speak to Ben, but is caught by Locke. She spends the night with Sawyer (although they did not have sex) and tells him that she is not pregnant. They argue over his exaggerated show of relief. Sawyer accuses her of bouncing back and forth between him and Jack. Kate slaps him on the face and then heads back to the beach. When Sawyer returns with Miles and Aaron, she also takes over as Aaron's primary caretaker when Sawyer reveals that Claire has gone missing. Later, Sayid and Kate follow Jack and Sawyer to avoid them being attacked by the boat's soldiers. They meet up with the remaining Others and join forces to defeat the boat's soldiers. They all board Lapidus' helicopter, but as they travel back to the freighter a fuel leak is discovered, and after all the excess weight is thrown out, Sawyer kisses Kate, then asks her to do a favor for him back home and jumps out. ===After the Island=== In \\"Eggtown\\", Kate goes on trial for her father's murder. Jack testifies on her behalf as a character witness. He lies under oath and tells the court that it was Kate that saved him and the other survivors. Under cross-examination, he is asked whether he loves the defendant and he replies \\"Not anymore.\\" Kate looks crestfallen and demands that Jack's testimony cease. Kate's mother, the prosecution's star witness, tries to reconcile with Kate, and then decides not to testify. She is consequently released on ten years probation, provided that she does not leave California. Kate meets ups with Jack after she is released and he confesses to her that he lied on the stand (about no longer loving her) and Kate is delighted. She invites him to come home with her, but he hesitates because he is not ready to see Aaron (his nephew) again. In \\"Something Nice Back Home\\", Kate is seen living in an established relationship with Jack, who is also acting as a surrogate father for his nephew Aaron. Later, Jack asks Kate to marry him, which she happily accepts. Jack later confronts Kate about her \\"errands\\", which involved her meeting with Sawyer's daughter; Clementine and his ex-girlfriend Cassidy. Kate refuses to tell Jack any details about this, as she knows Sawyer would not want anybody else to know. Jack is angered by her secrecy and raises his voice, waking Aaron up. Kate rushes to comfort him then Jack leaves, paranoid, ending their relationship. In \\"Through the Looking Glass\\", Jack informs her of John Locke's funeral. Jack then tells her that they need to return to the island, but Kate grows furious and leaves. Season 5 Kate is surprisingly confronted by Dan Norton, a lawyer who is asking for a blood sample from both her and Aaron to determine their biological relationship. Norton refuses to tell Kate who his client is, and Kate refuses to give him a blood sample. Kate visits Sun, who convinces her to go see Norton and try to get him to reveal who his client is. Kate leaves Aaron in Sun's care while visiting Norton's firm, but cannot get a name out of him. Kate and Jack follow Norton to his clients house, who turns out to be Claire's mother. Jack goes in to talk to her and then realizes that she isn't the client they were looking for. When approached by Ben later, Kate discovers that he was the one who was trying to get a blood sample from her. Kate realizes that she is not supposed to raise Aaron and leaves him in the care of Claire's mother. She goes to Jack's apartment and they spend the night together. She returns to the island with the other survivors on flight 316. Sawyer explains that the year is 1977 and secretly gets her, Jack and Hurley to join the Dharma Initiative. Sayid shoots a young Ben Linus and Kate and Sawyer save his life by bringing him to Richard Alpert. After refusing to aid Jack in his plans to detonate the hydrogen bomb, Kate returns to the Dharma Initiative, to then be put on the Dharma sub with Sawyer and Juliet. However, she insists that the three leave the submarine to prevent Jack from detonating the bomb. When the three return to the island, they eventually reunite with Jack, Jin, Sayid and Hurley. Although Sawyer tries to persuade Jack not to use the bomb, his efforts are in vain and they fight. Kate tells Jack that if he really believes that detonating the bomb is the best thing, then she will help him, while Sawyer reluctantly agrees to go along with the plan after Juliet also takes Jack's side. Kate assists Jack in getting the bomb to the required location, but when he drops it down a tunnel, it does not go off, despite the fact that it is supposed to explode on impact. Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Juliet are shocked, but immediately, the Dharma drill that had been drilling deep into the pocket of magnetic energy that Jack was trying to contain went too far, and Juliet is ultimately dragged down the tunnel, into the source of the energy. Kate and Sawyer try to get her out but the strength of the magnetism is too much and she is pulled into the tunnel. Kate attempts to remove a distressed Sawyer from the scene along with Jack, unaware that Juliet remains conscious for now and desperately attempts to detonate the bomb, eventually succeeding. Season 6 Kate continues her mission to reunite Claire with Aaron. When she eventually finds her, she discovers that a dark side has grown in Claire, who has become unstable due to many years of living alone, in the belief that the others are holding her son hostage in a Temple. Sawyer escapes from the Temple and Kate follows him to apologize for the loss of Juliet and to ask him to help her find Claire. Sawyer assures Kate she is not to blame, and reveals his intention to propose to Juliet. Kate breaks down, and ultimately returns to the Temple to get Claire. When Kate joins the Man in Black's camp, after Claire learns that it was Kate who took Aaron and attempts to murder Kate by throwing her to the ground and pulling a knife on her. Kate is saved by 'Locke' and seeing that Kate is upset by the loss of Claire's friendship, warns her that Claire should not be reunited with Aaron as she is now 'crazy'. Claire later tearfully apologises for her actions and thanks Kate for keeping her son safe. Kate, (who has since grouped up with 'Locke') plans a breakout from the Man in Black's party, Kate wants to bring Claire but Sawyer refuses, saying she is no longer the friend they once knew following her attack on Kate. When Claire sees them leaving her behind again she gives chase and holds them at gunpoint just as they attempt to board a boat to escape. Kate talks Claire around, convincing her to come with them so she can finally go home to her son. The group try to leave on Widmore's sub, and Kate is shot through the right collarbone. Once on board, while Jack is tending to Kate's wound, they discover that the Man in Black has placed a C4 explosive on board. Sawyer inadvertently causes the timer to count down faster and Sayid, Jin and Sun are killed in the resulting explosion. Jack asks Hurley to take care of Kate and make sure that he takes her to safety off the sinking vessel. On the shore, Kate races over to Jack and is relieved to find him safe. Kate, Jack and Hurley mourn the loss of their friends while Sawyer remains unconscious. As the Man in Black starts to destroy the Island, Kate helps Jack kill him by shooting him. Jack is wounded in the fight with 'Locke' and he and Kate part for the final time due to their different destinies. Jack and Kate share a passionate kiss and declare their love for each other one last time before Jack leaves with Hurley to save the Island, and Kate goes to fulfill her promise to find Claire before departing on the Ajira plane, piloted by Frank. Along the way, they find Claire, who is scared to leave the island as she feels she is no longer a fit mother. Kate convinces her that her worries are normal and promises to help her. Kate escapes the island on the plane with Claire, Sawyer, Miles, Frank and Richard - Kate hand in hand with Claire. In the Sideways, Kate remembers her life when she helps deliver Aaron at the concert. Kate waits at the concert so she can reunite with Jack. She finds him and tells him \\"I've missed you so much\\", a reference that she probably lived a long life after leaving the Island and missed Jack profoundly. Jack eventually awakens and remembers Kate and his friends. Together with Jack at her side, they move on together. ==Development== Before the pilot was shot, and during the writing phase, Kate was to emerge as the leader for the survivors, motivating them to build shelter and begin considering life as permanent residents of the island, however when it was decided Jack should survive, she was a second-in-command. In this original description for Kate, she was a slightly older woman separated from her husband, who went to the bathroom in the tail-section of the plane. However, that idea ended up being used for Rose Henderson (L. Scott Caldwell) and her husband Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson). Kate is involved in a love triangle with Jack (Matthew Fox) and Sawyer (Josh Holloway) and is seen as very protective of Claire (Emilie de Ravin) and her baby Aaron. Around 75 women of different shapes, sizes, ethnicities and ages auditioned to be Kate, including Yunjin Kim, who later played the role of Sun- Hwa Kwon. In the initial plans, Jack was going to die midway through the first episode and then Kate would emerge as the leader. She was not going to be a fugitive, instead her husband was going to go to the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid-air and she would remain adamant on the Island that he was alive. This ended up being used for Rose's character. The producers were impressed with Canadian Evangeline Lilly's audition, as she displayed the confidence with vulnerability that they were looking for. As this was Lilly's first role, she had difficulty obtaining a visa to work in the United States. She was supposed to start on the first day of filming, but the schedule was rearranged to give her more time and, in the meantime, the producers began auditioning again in case the visa did not come through. However, during one of the auditions, they got an email confirming that she had obtained her visa and could start work on the show.\\"Before They Were Lost\\". Lost: The Complete First Season, Buena Vista Home Entertainment. September 6, 2005. Featurette, disc 7. Executive producer Damon Lindelof told about Lilly's casting: ==Reception== Some critics considered Kate Austen to be one of the more weakly written characters of Lost. Evangeline Lilly, who portrayed Kate, was critical of the way her character was written saying that ‚ÄúI did throw scripts across rooms when I'd read them . . . because I would get very frustrated by the diminishing amount of autonomy she had and the diminishing amount of her own story there was to play.‚Äùhttps://www.eonline.com/news/956919/evangeline-lilly- details-awful-experiences-on-the-set-of-lost Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger did not find Kate to be ‚Äúnearly as compelling a central character as Sayid or Hurley (or some of the freighter people, for that matter).‚Äù In reviewing the episode \\"What Kate Does\\" in 2010, critic Emily VanDerWerff of the Los Angeles Times stated that though \\"Kate's one of the show's most important characters,... she's also one of the series' most obvious missed opportunities.\\"VanDerWerff, Todd (February 9, 2010), \\"Look Out! It's a Kate Episode! \\", Los Angeles Times. Retrieved on February 14, 2010. On the other hand, Robert Bianco of USA Today said Lilly's performance in the season four episode \\"Eggtown\\" was worthy of a Primetime Emmy Award nomination.Bianco, Robert, (June 12, 2008) \\"Who Will Make Emmy Happy? \\", USA Today. Retrieved on June 13, 2008. Lilly's performance in \\"Whatever Happened, Happened\\" also received praise from TV critics and fans of the show alike. Lilly got a Golden Globe nomination for best dramatic actress in a lead role for her work in season 3. Lifestyle website Beliefnet named her among the Top 10 Most Empowering Women on TV Today. ==References== Category:Lost (TV series) characters Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional con artists Category:Fictional characters from Iowa Category:Fictional mechanics Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional patricides Category:Fictional sole survivors Category:Fictional victims of kidnapping Category:Television characters introduced in 2004 Category:Time travelers ","title":"Kate Austen"},{"id":"2231000","text":"Chashu (, also Romanized as Chash≈´) is a village in Kuhak Rural District, in the Central District of Jahrom County, Fars Province, Iran.

Shannon was introduced in the pilot episode as the stepsister of fellow crash survivor Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder). She was a series regular until her funeral in \\"What Kate Did\\". For most of her time on the Island, she was unhelpful and spent much of her time sunbathing. She formed a relationship with another survivor from the plane crash, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews). Shannon was accidentally shot by Ana Lucia Cortez who mistakes her for an Other. During the casting process, she was compared to Paris Hilton. Naveen Andrews, who played the character Sayid on the show, had the idea of encouraging the writers to write a romantic relationship between his character and Shannon into the story. Critics found her to be a largely unsympathetic character until only shortly before her death. Nonetheless, Grace received a Teen Choice Award nomination for her role as Shannon. ==AppearancesPrior to the crash=== When Shannon is eight, her father marries Sabrina Carlyle (Lindsay Frost), and she spends much of her adolescence with her stepbrother Boone. She studies ballet and, as she gets older, teaches dance classes to young girls. When she is eighteen, Shannon's father dies in a car crash. He did not have a will prepared, so all of his money and property goes to his wife. Sabrina refuses to help Shannon financially, despite Shannon winning a prestigious yet non-paying internship to the Martha Graham Dance Company in New York. Unable to come up with the money herself, Shannon moves to France for a short time to work as an au pair. Shannon later forms a plan to con her stepbrother, Boone Carlyle, into giving her some of the inheritance she rightly deserved. Playing on her knowledge of Boone's love for her, she makes it appear her boyfriend Brian abuses her. Boone pays Brian to leave her, and Shannon plans to secretly take half the money. During one con in Sydney, her \\"abusive boyfriend\\" ruins Shannon's ruse after Boone cuts him a check. Boone storms off to his hotel room and plans to return to the States. When Shannon's boyfriend takes off with all of the money, Shannon goes to Boone's hotel room in Sydney, drunk, and Boone allows her to seduce him. After they have sex, Shannon tells Boone things will go back to the way they had been before. He expresses anger because, as always, they both know she is in control of their situation and relationship. The following morning at the Sydney airport, Sayid Jarrah approaches Shannon, asking her to watch his bag for him. She deftly obliges, but soon leaves it unattended. Before the doomed Flight 815 takes off, Shannon rummages through her hand luggage for her asthma inhaler, which Boone casually hands to her. Six hours into the flight, only moments before the crash, Shannon and Boone are momentarily seen as Charlie Pace stumbles through their row. ===After the crash=== Upon landing on the Island, she decides to join Sayid on a hike to transmit a distress signal, after she and Boone have an argument about her selfishness. When they discover a French looped signal already being transmitted, Shannon's knowledge of the language is used to translate it. Later, Shannon has an asthma attack, but her inhalers are nowhere to be found. Sun (Yunjin Kim) cures her, by using eucalyptus plants to help her breathing. Because of her selfish and manipulative behavior, Boone brands Shannon useless. Sayid enlists her to help translate the maps belonging to the French woman who made the radio transmission, Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan). Shannon and Sayid soon form a romantic relationship. After returning from a romantic night along the beach with Sayid, she learns Boone has died after falling from a great height. At his funeral, Shannon does not speak, but allows Sayid to talk instead. Shannon holds Locke (Terry O'Quinn) responsible for Boone's death, and asks Sayid to take action. When he refuses, she steals the key to the gun case from Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and holds Locke at gunpoint in the jungle. When Rousseau arrives on the beach one morning to warn the camp of the Others' imminent arrival, Shannon prepares to migrate to the caves with the rest of the group. Before leaving on the raft the survivors have built, Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley) gives Shannon guardianship of his dog, Vincent, as a means to help her recover from her loss. At the start of season two, Shannon loses Vincent in the jungle. While searching for him, she is shocked to find Walt standing before her, dripping wet. However, when Sayid finds her, Walt disappears. Over the next few days, Sayid builds Shannon a shelter on the beach. He brings her to it and they soon decide to sleep together for the first time. Sayid leaves to get a bottle of water for Shannon and in his absence, Shannon again sees a vision of Walt, standing in the shelter with her. Sayid brushes off her experience as a dream. She uses Vincent to try to find Walt, only for him to lead her to Boone's grave. After a while, she takes Vincent into the jungle again, with Sayid in pursuit. As it starts to rain, Sayid and Shannon admit their feelings for each other before both seeing Walt. Shannon runs after him, only to be accidentally shot by Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez), who mistakes her for an Other. She dies moments later in Sayid's arms. Shannon's death not only left Sayid heartbroken, but also caused a rift between the survivors and the Tailies. Throughout the rest of the season, Ana Lucia is shown to be guilt-ridden over killing Shannon. During season six the afterlife experienced by the survivors is shown as an alternate timeline where the plane never crashed. Boone is seen on the plane traveling alone and explains he went to save Shannon from a bad relationship, but she did not want to come with him. In the series finale \\"The End\\" Boone is being attacked by someone outside a local bar, with Hurley and Sayid watching from afar. Shannon tries to defend him but is overpowered. Sayid gets out of the car and knocks the attacker unconscious. He gets down to help Shannon, and they remember their lives on the island and realize they are in the afterlife. Later that night she is reunited with the other passengers of Oceanic 815 and they all \\"move on\\" together. ==Personality== During the casting process, Shannon was compared to Paris Hilton, and Lost producer Damon Lindelof described her as a \\"bitch. She is like a typical spoiled daddy's girl who gets whatever she wants and is not responsible to the slightest bit.\\" Eirik Knutzen of The Repository found Shannon to be \\"a self-centered twit,\\" and she was also called a \\"spoiled daddy's girl.\\" Boone describes her as a \\"self-centered little bitch.\\" On her first night on the Island, Shannon is confident they will be rescued, refusing to help the others organize the luggage. She does not care Rose (L. Scott Caldwell) has lost her husband, and spends much of her time sunbathing. She manipulates Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) into catching a fish for her, after which Boone apologizes on behalf of Shannon for \\"using this poor guy like [she] use[s] everyone else.\\" In \\"Whatever the Case May Be,\\" Boone says to Shannon, \\"Don't you see the way they look at us around here? They don't take us seriously. We're a joke. I'm trying to contribute something. You're just ‚Äì you're useless.\\" This motivates her to help Sayid translate maps he obtained from Rousseau. ==Development== The producers were looking for someone who had a \\"Paris Hilton quality\\" to play Shannon, but she could not just be shallow, as the storyline would require more than that. A lot of women auditioned before the producers finally settled on Maggie Grace.\\"Before They Were Lost.\\" Lost: The Complete First Season, Buena Vista Home Entertainment. September 6, 2005. Featurette, disc 7. She was written to be unlikable in the first season as the producers needed a character they could use to create opposition and conflict. The producers thought it would be interesting for there to be more to Shannon and Boone's relationship than just Boone's possessive brotherly interest. They came up with the idea for them to be unrelated stepsiblings, who have a romantic encounter, which became the twist for their backstory.\\"Lost on Location - Hearts and Minds.\\" Lost: The Complete First Season, Buena Vista Home Entertainment. Featurette, disc 7. Released on September 6, 2005. When Boone is killed at the end of season one, it forces Shannon into a more adult existence on the Island. Grace noted Boone is \\"the only person that ever really knew and loved Shannon, in spite of herself. Of course, losing him, especially with so much left unsaid and unresolved, will change her irrevocably.\\"Keveney, Bill, (April 7, 2006) \\"Death for Boone, Birth for Claire on Lost,\\" USA Today.

Naveen Andrews, who plays Sayid, came up with the idea for Shannon and Sayid relationship. He thought, \\"What would really shock Middle-America? What if Sayid was to have a relationship with a woman that looked like Miss America? The most unlikely pairing‚Ä¶ to come completely from left field.\\" This pairing made Shannon \\"less flighty... more of a person to be reckoned with.\\" According to Lost producer Carlton Cuse, \\"The relationships [the audience] expect on the show are not necessarily the ones that we [the producers] necessarily are going to give you, but we want to try to find ways in which characters that you don't expect to kind of connect to one another to connect in ways that are kind of surprising.\\"\\"Lost on Location - Abandoned.\\" Lost: The Complete Second Season - The Extended Experience, Buena Vista Home Entertainment. Featurette, disc 7. Released on September 5, 2006. Shannon's flashbacks in \\"Abandoned\\" were used to allow the audience to get to a \\"really emotional level with the character, [to] finally understand ... why she was the way she was.\\" Her death was planned before the start of season two, as the producers wanted the survivors in the tail section of the plane and the survivors of the fuselage to be forced to come together under difficult circumstances. Her death was also used to \\"spin Sayid off in another direction.\\" Damon Lindelof commented \\"It's sort of understood on Lost that that's what you sign up for. There's going to be constant character turnover, because the stakes on the Island are life-or-death.\\" Lindelof felt an \\"intense, emotional sense of loss\\" when watching her death. In her post-death appearance in \\"Collision,\\" Maggie Grace was credited as \\"special guest star.\\" She received the same billing when she returned in season three, appearing in Nikki and Paulo's flashbacks. Carlton Cuse noted \\"it was really fun for us to actually have Boone and Shannon reemerge in the stories.\\"Lindelof, Damon & Cuse, Carlton, (March 26, 2007) \\"Official Lost Audio Podcast March 26, 2007,\\" ABC. Shannon was originally in \\"LA X\\", the season premiere for the sixth and final season, but had to be written out as Grace was unavailable. The producers eventually arranged for Grace to appear in \\"The End\\". ==Reception== Chris Carabott from IGN was critical of both Shannon and her relationship with Boone before the plane crash, commenting \\"Shannon's ability to 'sort-of' understand French and Boone's lifeguard training have had little impact and as characters they bring very little to the table. There are also too many more intriguing storylines and characters around them that deserve attention.\\" On their relationship he added, \\"except for the final act, when they finally succumb to their lust for one another ...

Retrieved on October 28, 2008. In a later review, for the episode following Boone's death, he commented \\"[Boone and Shannon] were both left with very little to do this season. Especially Shannon, whose high point of usefulness was deciphering Rousseau's documents for Sayid. Well, Maggie Grace is given an opportunity to shine and she does an acceptable job as the distraught sibling who is now looking for someone to blame for Boone's death.

They are a subset of co-articulated consonants. They are to be distinguished from co-articulated consonants with secondary articulation; that is, a second articulation not of the same manner. An example of a doubly articulated consonant is the voiceless labial-velar plosive , which is a and a pronounced simultaneously. On the other hand, the voiceless labialized velar plosive has only a single stop articulation, velar (), with a simultaneous approximant- like rounding of the lips. In some dialects of Arabic, the voiceless velar fricative has a simultaneous uvular trill, but this is not considered double articulation either. ==Possibilities for double articulation== There are four independently controllable articulations that may double up in the same manner of articulation: labial, coronal, dorsal, and pharyngeal. (The glottis controls phonation, and works simultaneously with many consonants. It is not normally considered an articulator, and an ejective , with simultaneous closure of the velum and glottis, is not considered a doubly articulated consonant.) Approximant consonants, such as and , may be either doubly or secondarily articulated. For example, in English, is a labialized velar that could be transcribed as , but the Japanese is closer to a true labial‚Äìvelar . However, it is normal practice to use the symbols and for the labialized approximants, and some linguists restrict the symbols to that usage. No claims have ever been made for doubly articulated flaps or trills, such as a simultaneous alveolar‚Äìuvular trill, , and these are not expected to be found. Several claims have been made for doubly articulated fricatives or affricates, most notoriously a Swedish phoneme which has its own IPA symbol, . However, laboratory measurements have never succeeded in demonstrating simultaneous frication at two points of articulation, and such sounds turn out to be either secondary articulation, or a sequence of two non-simultaneous fricatives. (Despite its name, the \\"voiceless labial-velar fricative\\" is actually a voiceless approximant; the name is a historical remnant from before the distinction was made.) Such sounds can be made, with effort, but it is very difficult for a listener to discern them, and therefore they are not expected to be found as distinctive sounds in any language. Clicks are sometimes said to be doubly articulated, as they involve a coronal (more rarely labial) forward articulation, which defines the various 'types' of clicks and the IPA letter assigned to them, plus a dorsal closure. However, this second, dorsal place of closure functions as part of the controlling mechanism of the lingual ingressive airstream used to generate the click. Thus, much as the glottal closure of ejectives (the airstream-generating mechanism of such consonants) is not considered to be a second place of articulation, clicks are not generally described as such either. Indeed, it is possible to have a true doubly articulated click, such as the labial-dental allophone, , of the bilabial click in Taa.Traill, Anthony. (1985). Phonetic and Phonological Studies of !X√≥√µ Bushman. (Quellen zur Khoisan-Forschung, 1). Hamburg: Helmut Buske. ==Double articulation in stops== This leaves stops, and both oral and nasal doubly articulated stops are found. However, there is a great asymmetry in the places of their articulation. Of the six possible combinations of labial, coronal, dorsal, and pharyngeal, one is common, and the others vanishingly rare. *The common articulation is labial‚Äìdorsal, which includes labial‚Äìvelar stops such as the mentioned above, and labial-uvular stops such as [qÕ°p]. Labial-velar stops are found throughout West and Central Africa, as well as eastern New Guinea. Labial-uvular stops are much rarer, but have been found in three Mangbutu-Efe languages spoken in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda: Mamvu, Lese, and Efe. These languages contain some highly unusual doubly articulated stops that have been confirmed by acoustic and aerodynamic measurements, including a phonemic labial-uvular stop with a voiceless uvular part and a voiced implosive bilabial part, [qÕ°…ì], a non- phonemic labial-velar stop with a voiced velar part and a voiceless bilabial part, […°Õ°p] (which occurs as an allophone of a voiced labial-velar implosive, […†…ì]), and a non-phonemic voiceless labial-velar stop with a trilled release, [kÕ°p ôÃ•] (only present in Efe). Fully voiceless labial-uvular [qÕ°p] occurs also, as an allophone of /qÕ°…ì/. *A second possibility, labial‚Äìcoronal, is attested phonemically by labial‚Äìalveolar and labial‚Äìpostalveolar in a single language, Y√©l√Æ Dnye of New Guinea. Some West African languages, such as Dagbani and Nzema, have labial‚Äìpostalveolars as allophones of labial‚Äìvelars before high front vowels. *A third possibility, coronal‚Äìdorsal, is found marginally in a few languages. Isoko, spoken in Nigeria, has laminal dental stops (plosives and nasals) that in some dialects are realized as dental‚Äìpalatal stops. However, these are not contrastive with either dental or palatal stops, unlike the articulations mentioned above, and Peter Ladefoged considers them to be \\"accidental contacts in two regions\\", rather than being inherently double. Hadza has alveolar‚Äìpalatal lateral affricates, but the dental contact is optional. Similarly, several languages of Australia, such as Maung, have dental‚Äìpalatals which are variants of laminal postalveolars, with an \\"extended closure covering the entire region from the teeth to the hard palate\\". In both cases, the double articulations are variants of laminal consonants, which have inherently broad contact with the roof of the mouth. Rwanda is sometimes noted as having my , by , tw , etc., but these are consonant sequences, not double articulation. If the sj-sound […ß] in Swedish is, in fact, a velar fricative [x] and a post-alveolar fricative [ É] pronounced at the same time, then it is a coronal-dorsal consonant. *The other three possibilities, which would involve the epiglottis, had not been known until recently. However, with the advent of fiber-optic laryngoscopy, a greater variety of epiglottal and laryngeal activity has been found than had been expected. For example, the Somali was recently found to be a uvular‚Äìepiglottal consonant . It is not known how widespread such sounds might be, or if epiglottal consonants might combine with coronal or labial consonants. The Bantu languages Ila, Kafue Twa and Lundwe have been described as having labio-glottal and palato-glottal fricatives. See Ila language for a description. ==Triple articulation== Triply articulated consonants are only attested as glottalized doubly articulated consonants, and this can be argued to be an effect of phonation or airstream mechanism rather than as a third articulation, just as other glottalized consonants are not considered to be doubly articulated. The most obvious case are the various types of glottalized clicks mentioned above. Another example is 'unreleased' final in Vietnamese, which after or is often labial-velar . ==References== *Peter Ladefoged and Ian Maddieson, The Sounds of the World's Languages.

The series follows the lives of over forty survivors of the crash of Oceanic Flight 815. Walt is introduced in the pilot episode as one of the survivors aboard the plane, which crashes onto the island where most of the program takes place. He is the 10-year-old son of Michael Dawson (played by Harold Perrineau). Walt appears in thirty episodes of Lost; 27 in seasons one and two as a series regular, and three more episodes as a guest star. He also features in the Lost epilogue \\"The New Man in Charge\\". Throughout the series, he is the only child main character. Initially, Walt and Michael have a dysfunctional father-son relationship, causing Walt to form friendships with other survivors, such as Locke and Sun. Walt leaves the island on a raft with Michael and two other survivors during the episode \\"Exodus\\", but is kidnapped by a group of hostile island inhabitants known as the Others. Walt is then released by the Others in the episode \\"Live Together, Die Alone\\", who claim that he was \\"more than [they] could handle\\", and he and Michael leave the island at the end of season two. When originally developed, Lost creators intended for Walt to display supernatural powers, such as the ability to summon animals through telepathy, but when Kelley had aged significantly for him to no longer convincingly look ten years old, the character's arc was changed and Walt was written out of the show. After auditioning many children for the part, Kelley was hired by the program's producers, who had been impressed by his performance in the 2002 film Antwone Fisher. ==ArcBefore the crash=== Walt as a baby with his father Michael Walt is the 10-year-old son of Michael Dawson, a construction worker and part-time artist. He was born August 24, 1994, and is named after Michael's father, Walter. His mother is Susan Lloyd, a law student, who refused to marry Michael. When offered a job in Amsterdam, Susan persuades Michael to let her take Walt with her while he is still a baby. Two weeks before Walt's second birthday, Susan tells Michael that she and her boss, Brian Porter, are planning to get married and will be moving to Rome, Italy, at the end of the month. A legal battle ensues between Walt's parents. Several months later, they settle their dispute amicably and Michael lets Susan keep Walt with her. Eight years later, Susan dies in Australia due to a \\"blood disorder\\". Brian pleads with Michael to take custody of the boy and even gives him tickets for the flight to Sydney and back, plus money for travel expenses. Brian reveals that he had never wanted to adopt Walt and that he is scared of him. When Michael arrives in Australia to collect Walt, he does not take too well to him. Michael spares Walt's feelings by telling him that Brian wants to keep him, but that it is up to Michael and he has decided to take him. ===After the crash=== Soon after the crash, Walt is left under the care of different people due to Michael's involvement in helping other survivors‚Äîin particular, Walt spends time with John Locke. He is intrigued by Locke's hunting instincts, and constantly tries to sneak away with him, always unsuccessfully. He sneaks away with Locke and Boone, and exhibits a natural talent in knife throwing. Michael soon arrives and is enraged, taking Walt away from them and forbidding him to see Locke again. Walt takes Vincent, the dog, and leaves camp, heading into the jungle, where he encounters a polar bear. He is rescued by Michael and Locke. Michael begins constructing a raft to leave the island, and finishes it after a few days. Walt secretly sets alight to it, completely destroying it. Later, Walt confesses to burning the original raft, explaining that he did not want to leave the island, but decides they need to leave. The next morning, Walt gives Vincent to Shannon before he leaves on the raft with Michael, Jin and Sawyer. That night, however, they encounter the Others, who kidnap Walt. Walt remains in captivity with the Others, but frequently appears to Shannon. In the mobisode \\"Room 23\\" it is revealed Walt posed a greater threat to the Others than they had expected, as he had been doing something unspecified that frightened them so that they would not go in to see him. Ben responds to a particular situation with a blaring alarm and people in commotion, and Juliet suggests that Ben take responsibility of the situation and bring Walt back to Michael. As Michael is inspecting the technical equipment inside the hatch, he unexpectedly receives a message that he believes is from Walt. Michael is briefly reunited with Walt after he is brought to the Others' camp. Later, Michael returns with Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Hurley, in an exchange for Walt and their freedom. Walt waits in a boat, and he and Michael sail off. ===After the island=== While off the island, Walt learns that Michael killed Ana-Lucia and Libby and decided to live at his grandmother's house so as not to speak or have anything to do with his father. In \\"The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham\\", Walt is shown to be living in New York City. He is visited by Locke, using a wheelchair at that point, having returned from the Island. Locke does not ask Walt to return to the Island as he does with the rest of the Oceanic returnees, as he felt that the boy had been through enough already. In \\"There's No Place Like Home\\", after being visited by Locke, Walt visits Hurley at the Santa Rosa Mental Institution with his grandmother. He asks Hurley why the Oceanic Six are lying and is told that they're lying to protect the people left behind on the island. Walt is under the assumption that his father is still alive and living on the island. In \\"The End\\", Lost final episode, neither Walt nor Michael feature among the main characters moving on to the afterlife. However, in the 12-minute epilogue to the series, \\"The New Man in Charge\\" (included on the DVD box set), Ben and Hurley visit Walt in the mental hospital that Hurley had previously been in. Ben promises Walt he can \\"help his father,\\" even though they both know Michael is dead. Hurley and Ben take Walt \\"home\\" to the Island, where Hurley promises him he will have a \\"job\\". ==Personality== Walt is a bit uneasy initially after being left with his father. He spends most of season 1 dodging his father and exploring the island with his dog, Vincent. ==Development== Many children were seen for the role of Walt. They were narrowed down to a top three, with Malcolm David Kelley winning the part after the producers were impressed with his role in the 2002 film Antwone Fisher. When Kelley was originally cast, the character of Walt was a 10-year-old boy, but, after two seasons, Kelley no longer looked 10. While the first four seasons move slowly through time and only months have passed on the show, the actual filming stretched over several years. The show's writers dealt with this by sending Michael and Walt away from the island at the end of the second season. In his brief appearance at the end of season three, Kelley is noticeably taller and older with a deeper voice. This fact is acknowledged by Locke in \\"Confirmed Dead\\". In the season four episode, \\"Meet Kevin Johnson\\", Kelley makes a brief uncredited cameo as Walt in the episode's flashbacks. Make-up and CGI were used to make Kelley look younger and more like a 10-year-old. In the season four finale, \\"There's No Place Like Home\\", Walt appears in a flash-forward, but this scene is set about three years after the plane crash, so Kelley's older appearance is not a problem. When asked about the production difficulties associated with Walt and possible appearances of the character in the fourth season, co-creator Damon Lindelof stated: \\"We've always known Malcolm was going to grow faster than we could shoot the show. And we planned for it. Trust us. Please trust us. You'll see [Walt] again. But you're gonna have to be patient. Sorry.\\" When the Lost producers were developing the character of Walt, they initially intended for him to display supernatural powers by summoning animals‚Äîin the episode \\"Special\\", it is suggested that Walt is able both to cause a bird to fly into a window and make a polar bear attack him through telepathy. This is also alluded to in \\"Live Together, Die Alone\\", when Ben describes Walt as being \\"more than [the Others] could handle\\". Kelley himself was also under the impression that his character possessed \\"magic powers\\", but after he had aged significantly enough for him to look no longer ten years old, the writers' plans were changed, and Walt was written out at the end of season two. Walt returned to Lost in \\"The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham\\", when Locke visits him in New York. Kelley had stated a willingness to return to the show again, which was realized in \\"The New Man in Charge\\". ==Reception== Walt's only centric episode was the season one episode, \\"Special\\", which received positive reviews from critics. Chris Carabott of IGN described the relationship \\"or lack thereof\\" between Walt and his father as \\"heart wrenching\\". Kirthana Ramisetti of Entertainment Weekly stated that it was \\"interesting\\" to discover that \\"Walt is 'different' and has special powers\\". She also named the scene of Walt and Michael reading letters towards the end of the episode as \\"one of [her favorites] of the entire season\\".

For most of the show's run, Hurley served as the show's comic relief, but occasionally, and most notably in the final season, he was shown in a more serious light. In the series finale, he takes over as the Island's protector from Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) then takes Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) as his adviser, the same way Jacob (Mark Pellegrino) took Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell). He was cited as an unlikely hero among the show's characters. His storylines mostly involved his mental illness, his belief that his lottery win is a curse to those around him, his relationship to The Numbers, and his short-lived relationship with Libby (Cynthia Watros). ==Character biographyPrior to the crash=== Hurley is Mexican-American and lives in Los Angeles with his mother (Lillian Hurst). His father left the family when he was a child, at which point Hurley began overeating. He was involved in an accident in which a deck collapsed as he stepped onto it, killing two people. Even though there were too many people on the deck prior to his arrival, Hurley feels great guilt because of his weight. He sinks into a depressive state, so his mother checks him into a psychiatric institution. There he creates an imaginary friend called Dave (Evan Handler) and meets Leonard Simms (Ron Bottitta), a patient who keeps mumbling the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42. Hurley's condition eventually improves; he leaves the institution and he resumes his job at a fast-food restaurant. He uses the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42 in the lottery, and wins a record jackpot of $114m. Hurley immediately begins experiencing bad luck: his grandfather Tito dies of a heart attack, the priest at Tito's funeral is struck by lightning, there is a fatal fire at a shoe factory he owns, the house he buys his mother burns down; his brother, Diego, is dumped by his girlfriend for a waitress; and Hurley is wrongfully arrested for being a drug dealer. As his net worth increases, so does his bad luck. Hurley suspects the numbers he used to win the lottery are cursed, so he visits the institution again to speak with Leonard. He tells Hurley the man who could explain the mystery of the numbers, Sam Toomey, lives in Australia. Before Hurley can travel to Australia, his father (Cheech Marin) returns to the family. He convinces Hurley to go to a psychic to cure his curse, but Hurley discovers his father has paid the psychic to lie. Once in Australia, Hurley visits Sam Toomey's wife (Jayne Taini), who reveals that Sam was driven to suicide to escape his constant bad luck. Halfway through the return flight to Los Angeles, the plane hits turbulence, splits in mid-air, and crashes on an island in the South Pacific. ===After the crash=== Season 1 During the chaos post-crash, Hurley looks after Claire, a pregnant woman, at the request of Jack, a doctor. Hurley helps the group ration the remaining food and water from the plane; he slips Claire an extra ration for the baby. Hurley moves into the caves with some of the other survivors, where he discovers a pack of golf clubs and decides to create a golf course to ease the stress and tension of being stranded. When Claire claims to have been attacked one night, Hurley creates a census and discovers that Ethan, a fellow survivor, was never on the flight. When Hurley looks at the maps that Sayid recovered from Rousseau, Hurley discovers a sheet of paper containing the cursed numbers (4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42). He treks into the jungle in search of Rousseau, with Jack, Sayid and Charlie in pursuit. After being separated from the rest of the group, Hurley eventually encounters Rousseau, who reveals that the numbers brought her to the island, and agrees that they are cursed. That night, during a heart-to-heart, he tells Charlie about his wealth. Charlie does not take him seriously, and storms off. One morning, Rousseau arrives on the beach and warns the camp that the Others are coming. She then leads Hurley, Jack, Kate, Locke and Arzt to a wrecked slave ship called the Black Rock, which contains some dynamite. After Arzt dies when dynamite he is holding explodes, Hurley blames himself and his bad luck. Season 2 Hugo and Dave Hurley is brought into the hatch the survivors have found, and is given the task of checking the food inventory, and brings Rose to help. Hurley, believing everyone will hate him, attempts to blow up the food with dynamite, but Rose manages to talk him out of it. Hurley decides to distribute the food freely, explaining there is no feasible way to ration it. Shortly after the arrival of the tail-section survivors, Hurley takes a liking to Libby and the two bond. However, Sawyer eventually discovers Hurley has secret food stash, and blackmails him into helping him track a tree frog that is annoying him. One morning, he and Libby go jogging together, where Hurley tells her about the food stash. The two of them destroy it together. At a cliff-top, his imaginary friend Dave convinces him that he is still at the institution in a coma and the only way to \\"wake up\\" is to jump off the cliff. Hurley is about to jump when Libby stops him and makes him see reason. The two kiss before returning to camp. He then plans a surprise picnic for her, but forgets to bring blankets. Libby offers to retrieve them from the Hatch; however, after collecting them she is shot and killed by Michael. When Hurley learns of Libby's shooting he rushes to her side. After speaking at Libby's funeral, he agrees to help Michael rescue his son from the Others, who he has blamed for Libby's shooting. After trekking across the jungle Jack exposes Michael as a traitor. Hurley confronts Michael, and later Jack, for bringing them along on a mission when he knew it to be a trap. Eventually, they are ambushed by the Others, who tie, gag and blindfold them before bringing them to a pier. Hurley is released and instructed to return to his camp and tell his people that they can never come to this part of the island. Season 3 As Hurley approaches the beach camp, he encounters Desmond, who mentions a speech by Locke about rescuing Jack, Kate and Sawyer. When Locke gives this speech later, Hurley suspects Desmond of being able to see the future, so he and Charlie devise a plan to draw the truth from him by getting him drunk. Later, Hurley discovers an old Dharma Initiative van. He, Sawyer, Jin and Charlie attempt to fix it, culminating in Sawyer and Jin pushing the van down a steep hill so Hurley can jumpstart it. Just as they are about to crash, Hurley defies his curse and miraculously starts the van. Later on, a cocky Sawyer bets against the camp that he can beat their best player in Ping Pong. Hurley defeats Sawyer, causing him to refrain from using nicknames for a week. Later, Hurley and Sawyer discover Nikki stumbling out of the jungle, then collapsing. He mistakes her for dead and finds Paulo in the jungle in the same situation. After failing to find a certain cause of death, Hurley gives them a funeral, but fails to notice Nikki open her eyes seconds before being buried. Hurley cons Sawyer into being decent to his fellow castaways as Hurley believes Sawyer to be the camp's new leader until Jack returns. The next day, Desmond asks Hurley to join him, Jin and Charlie on a hike. On their trek, they notice a parachutist bailing out of her helicopter, prompting them to head inland. They find Naomi hanging from a tree, and the four cut her loose. The four carry her back to the beach, where they hide her in Hurley's shelter. Later, Hurley and the others are shown Jack's plan to deter the Others from carrying out their kidnapping. Just as Charlie and Desmond set off to the Looking Glass, Hurley offers to join them, but his offer is declined. He instead accompanies Claire to the radio tower. As Sawyer and Juliet head back to the beach, Hurley again offers his services, but again his help is denied. Hurley heads for the van and drives it onto the beach, killing an Other, giving Sawyer and Juliet time to deal with the rest. Season 4 Hurley and Jack speak on the radio, and Jack tells Hurley they were successful and that rescue is imminent. However, Desmond returns to shore with news of Charlie's death, devastating Hurley. On the way to Jack, Hurley falls behind and runs after the group in a panic, only to find Jacob's mysterious cabin. Hurley sees inside and runs away, screaming for help, only to bump into Locke. Locke and Hurley agree that the freighter Jack called is not rescue and become determined to stop Jack. When the survivors are reunited, Locke suggests the group take refuge at The Others' village, an offer Jack refuses. The group divides, with Hurley following Locke. Hurley travels with Locke's group and quickly becomes disturbed by Locke's ideas and methods, especially when Locke takes freighter member Charlotte hostage. Once they reach the village, Hurley and Sawyer become roommates, which irks Sawyer. When playing RISK with Sawyer and Locke the phone alert rings, so he hides in Ben's house with everyone. Later Hurley follows Ben's instructions and flees the house with everyone else. Once Ben catches up to them, Locke and Sawyer argue over who is keeping Hurley when Sawyer decides he's going back to Jack and the beach. Hurley convinces them to stop arguing and goes with Locke and Ben to find Jacob. Afterward, Hurley follows Ben and Locke to the Orchid Station, where Ben and Locke must move the Island. Sawyer and Jack find him; Ben tells Jack and his companions to leave the Island. Hurley follows them to the helicopter, where Lapidus is waiting. Hurley, Jack, Kate, Sawyer, Sayid, Sun, Aaron and Lapidus then fly off the Island, towards the freighter. Whilst in the air the island vanishes and the freighter explodes, forcing an emergency landing into a raft. Penelope Widmore's rescue boat rescues them, and Hurley, along with the rest of the Oceanic Six, move on to Sumba, where civilization awaits them. After leaving the island, Hurley and the other survivors are transported by cargo plane to a military base. Oceanic Airlines holds a press conference to tell the survivors' story in which they lie that there were no other survivors from the crash. Later he returns home to his mansion to find a surprise birthday party thrown by his parents. Hurley's father shows him his birthday present ‚Äì Hurley's old Camaro. When he gets in the car, he notices that the mileage is set to the Numbers. This greatly disturbs Hurley, and he accuses his father of making a joke. His father denies it, but Hurley is so disturbed that he runs away. When Sun has her baby, Hurley arrives in Korea to congratulate her. Later, Hurley sees Charlie in a convenience store, he drives off, and leads the police on a long chase. Hurley is arrested and brought to the police station, where he looks onto the two-way mirror and sees Charlie drowning with the words \\"THEY NEED YOU\\" written in marker on his hand. The mirror breaks and water come pouring out, and Hurley screams for help. The police officer sarcastically suggests that he can put Hurley in a mental hospital, which Hurley quickly jumps at. Hurley then goes to Santa Rosa Mental Health Institute where he is approached by a man named Matthew Abbadon, who claims to be an attorney for Oceanic Airlines. He asks Hurley if he would like to transfer to a nicer place with an ocean view, but Hurley denies the offer, not wanting to ever see the ocean. Abbadon asks Hurley if anyone else is still alive. Hurley then freaks out and calls for a nurse. When Hurley goes to point him out, he has left the room. When Hurley is sitting on the grounds one day, he is approached by Charlie, who tells him that \\"They need you.\\" Later, Jack comes to see Hurley to check he will not reveal the truth about the plane crash. Hurley suggests that the Island wants them back, and that they should listen. Hurley's mental condition deteriorates, and his doctor contacts Jack, who comes and visits him. Hurley insists to Jack that none of them really made it off the island and that they are all dead and tells Jack that someone will be coming to visit him too. Later, Hurley is visited by Sayid who is intent on taking Hurley from the mental institution to some place safe. Season 5 Hurley is accompanied by Sayid after he is broken out of the mental institution and taken to an apartment building, only to discover there are dangerous men inside waiting for Sayid to enter. Sayid fights with them, but gets shot by a tranquilizer dart in the process. Hurley speeds down the road with an unconscious Sayid, but is pulled over. He then sees a vision of Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez), who informs him of how to avoid the police. He returns to his house and confesses to his parents what actually happened on the island. Hurley's father takes the unconscious Sayid to Jack and orders Jack to stay away from Hurley. While alone in his house, Hurley is approached by Ben Linus, who asks Hurley to come with him so they can go back to the island, to which Hurley declines. Hurley runs outside of his house, confessing to the murders that Sayid committed, and is arrested. Ben later has his lawyer get the charges dropped against Hurley, who is released from jail. Hurley leaves jail in a taxi, and rides along with Jacob who asks Hurley why he does not want to return to the Island. Jacob explains to Hurley that he is not cursed, and leaves a guitar case with Hurley. Hurley takes Jacob's advice and goes to LA X to leave on the flight with Sun, Jack, Sayid, Kate and Ben. During the flight, the plane encounters severe turbulence and a bright flash of light and disappears. Hurley finds himself on the Island's lake, where he is saved by Jack. The two then wake up Kate nearby and witnesses Jin, wearing a Dharma jumpsuit, pointing a rifle at them. Jin drives them to an open field where Sawyer explains to them that the year is 1977. Sawyer alters the recruitment records to allow Hurley, Jack, and Kate in as members; Hurley is assigned work as a chef. Jack and Daniel Faraday agree that dropping a hydrogen bomb will destroy the Island and prevent Oceanic Flight 815 from crashing in 2004. Hurley, Miles, and Jin then take Kate, Jack, Juliet, Sawyer, and Sayid to the construction site where the Swan station is being built. Hurley stays behind in their van to treat a wounded Sayid as the hydrogen bomb is detonated. Season 6 After the detonation of the bomb, the survivors are transported forward to 2007, still on the Island. Jacob encounters Hurley again, telling him to take a dying Sayid to the Temple to save him. Once they arrive at the Temple, they are almost killed by the native inhabitants until Hurley claims that Jacob had sent them. To prove it, he shows the guitar case to the Others' leader Dogen (Hiroyuki Sanada), which contains an ankh with a scroll from Jacob in it. Later, Jacob's spirit again visits Hurley and instructs him to acquire Jack and walk to a lighthouse. Outside, Jacob reappears to Hurley, congratulating him on bringing Jack to the lighthouse as needed for Jack to realize that he is important to the Island. Jacob also divulges that he needed to get Jack and Hurley away from the Temple because \\"someone bad\\" was arriving there. The next morning Jack tells Hurley that they need to return to the Temple. Hurley stalls, until Richard Alpert, leads them to the ship The Black Rock and attempts to commit suicide using the dynamite. After this fails they head back to the beach where they meet Ben, Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson), Miles, Sun and Lapidus. The next day, he follows a still suicidal Richard into the jungle. He tells Richard that the spirit of Isabella, Richard's wife from 1867, had sent him. Hurley acts as an intermediary between the two, giving Richard the long-awaited opportunity to apologize to his wife. Richard tearfully thanks Hurley after Isabella's spirit leaves. Later, Richard decides to pack dynamite and explode the Ajira Airline to prevent the Man in Black from escaping. Hurley is initially on his side, but after Michael Dawson's spirit visits him and tells him he must prevent his plans, he tells Richard not to, or that they will all die. When Richard refuses, Hurley secretly walks to the Black Rock and defuses the remaining dynamite. An irate Richard splits their group up by taking Ben and Miles with him to look for other explosives, while Hurley, Jack, Sun, and Lapidus go to talk with the Man in Black. The whole group walks on to the Ajira plane, as the Man in Black claims that they will all leave on it. However, the Man in Black turns the group around after discovering explosives in the plane, insisting they take the submarine instead. The Man in Black tricks them by placing a bomb in Jack's bag, wanting to kill them all. Sayid grabs it and runs to the far end of the sub to sacrifice himself, despite Hurley's plea. The bomb explodes, and the sub begins to sink. Hurley, Kate, Jack, and Sawyer escape, but Jin and Sun drown. The four eventually arrive at a campfire where Jacob is waiting. Jack volunteers to take Jacob's place and be the next protector of the Island. Jack goes on to defeat the Man in Black, and takes Hurley and Ben with him to the heart of the island to return the light to the island. Jack knows this will kill him, so passes on his guardian role to Hurley. In tears, Hurley wonders what to do next, and asks Ben to be his adviser in protecting the Island. Ben gladly accepts the offer, and the two take up the post of guarding the Island. Hurley is last seen speaking to Walt in a Dharma van outside the Santa Rosa Mental Hospital about offering him a job when they return to the island. In afterlife, Hurley describes himself as being the luckiest guy alive. He owns Mr. Cluck's Chicken franchise, and is well known for his philanthropy work. One day Hurley is eating at a Mexican restaurant and Libby sees him and sits next to him. She then tells him that she thinks that they are connected and could be soul mates. Dr. Brooks then comes over to the table and takes Libby back to Santa Rosa Mental Hospital. Later Hurley is eating at Mr. Cluck's and runs into Desmond, who advises Hurley to seek her if he believes she may be right. After making a generous donation to Santa Rosa, Hurley is allowed to see Libby again. Libby then tells Hurley that when she first saw him on one of his Mr. Cluck's Commercials, she had a vision of the Island, with him being in it, and both of them being in Santa Rosa together. Hurley thinks she is crazy, but invites her on a date anyway. On the beach, Hurley sets out a picnic for Libby. They kiss and Hurley also remembers his life on the Island, and assures Libby she isn't crazy. In the final scene outside of a church where the survivors of Oceanic 815 meet, Hurley has a brief exchange with Ben. In the exchange Hurley tells Benjamin that he was a \\"real good number two,\\" while Benjamin replies that Hurley was a great number one. ==Development== Jorge Garcia was the first actor the producers knew they were going to cast. In his audition to play Sawyer, the producers recognized him from an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm which had aired the previous night. They thought he was spectacular, but didn't fit the role of Sawyer, so they created Hurley for him.\\"Before They Were Lost\\". Lost: The Complete First Season, Buena Vista Home Entertainment.

Hurley appears in three mobisodes: \\"The Adventures of Hurley and Frogurt\\", \\"Arzt and Crafts\\", and \\"Jin has a Temper Tantrum\\". ==In popular culture== The alternative rock band Weezer named their 2010 album Hurley after the character Hugo Reyes. The album's cover is a picture of actor Jorge Garcia.Weezer's ‚ÄòHurley‚Äô Album Inspires These Other ‚ÄòLost‚Äô Music Mash-Ups Jorge Garcia guest-starred on a season 6 episode of the CBS show How I Met Your Mother, \\"Blitzgiving\\" which had references to Lost. When Marshall asks for a random phone number, Jorge Garcia's character immediately shouts out the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. Later Jorge's character says \\"I feel like I was on that island for eternity\\", referencing his curse. Both Hugo and Stephen, the character that Jorge Garcia plays on How I Met Your Mother are cursed. In Jeremy Garelick's comedy The Wedding Ringer, Garcia portrays the character Lurch, who poses as one of Josh Gad's groomsmen. In the film's finale, the groomsmen are sat on a plane headed towards Tahiti for a weekend trip following the failed wedding. On the plane, Lurch claims, \\"I've got a bad feeling about this flight\\", a reference to Lost. The storyline involving Hurley's usage of the numbers 4 8 15 16 23 42 in a lottery has led to the sequence becoming a popular choice for lottery players. This issue came to particular attention when a record Mega Millions jackpot drawing on January 4, 2011 matched four of the six numbers (three plus the mega ball), resulting in several thousand people who played the numbers winning at least $150 each.Bonner, Jessie et al.

Sawyer was born on 18 February 1968; he was initially portrayed as a conniving, sarcastic handsome flirt who keeps stashes of washed-ashore items. His flashbacks typically depict a more sensitive side to him, juxtaposed against acts of betrayal and theft. He has a rivalry with Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) for the affections of the fugitive Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly). Sawyer and Kate share a brief and tumultuous affair, but Kate's love for Jack prevails. Their relationship is particularly prominent in the beginning of the third season. In the fourth season he develops a more heroic side, becoming protective of Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) and sacrificing his chance to escape so his friends can in the season finale. In the fifth season, Sawyer quickly acclimates to his new role as group leader as they are sent back through time, and after being without Kate for three years, falls in love with Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell). ==Character biographyPrior to the crash=== Sawyer was born in Jasper, Alabama in 1968 as James Ford. When James was nine years old, his parents were conned by a man under the alias of \\"Tom Sawyer\\"; as a result, his father killed both his mother and himself. On the day of the funeral, Jacob expresses his condolences to Sawyer, even as he is writing his 'I am going to find you' letter for the conman who took his family. At the time of his parents' death, James and his family were living in Knoxville, Tennessee according to the letter Sawyer carries. James also claims to have dropped out of high school in the ninth grade, but has a \\"high school transcript.\\" A major driving force in James' life is his vow to avenge his parents' deaths by hunting down the original Sawyer; as an adult, when he found himself in financial difficulty, he adopted the profession and alias of the man responsible for his parents' death, using his looks and charm to seduce wealthy married women, thus he \\"became the man he was hunting.\\" One of his scams involved waking up next to his victim and pretending to be late for an important meeting; as he rushes to get ready, his briefcase will \\"accidentally\\" spill open, revealing bundles of cash the woman \\"wasn't supposed to see.\\" With her interest piqued, he convinces her and her spouse to invest cash in a legally questionable, but supposedly lucrative business opportunity, before disappearing with the money. On one occasion, he runs this con up until he discovers the targeted couple has a child, experiences an attack of conscience and cancels the deal. On another occasion, Sawyer carries out a \\"Long con\\" (large-scale con) on a divorced woman named Cassidy who is known to be less gullible than his usual victims. He sets up the usual con and spills his cash over the ground, only this time with fake bank notes. Cassidy realizes he's trying to con her from the moment he spills the money, and tells him his con wouldn't have worked because she received no money after the divorce. Instead of being mad, however, she asks him to teach her his profession. After learning a few basic tricks, Cassidy soon asks Sawyer to pull off a long con. He tells her such a con requires money, and she reveals she actually received $600,000 from her ex-husband. He pretends to begin a long con, using her money to set it up, but in fact he simply plans to take the money. However, she has begun to grow on him, and he wavers on his con. While visiting the diner of Kate's mother, his partner (played by Kevin Dunn) forces Sawyer to resume his con on threat of death. He goes back to Cassidy and tells her that he has been conning her, and warns her of a car parked outside. He stuffs the money into a bag and tells her to leave with it, and he will take the blame. When she runs off, he takes the real money (having given her fake bank notes) and returns to the car, actually empty. Cassidy presses charges against Sawyer for conning her, and he is sent to prison. Cassidy visits him and informs him they have a daughter, named Clementine. While in prison, Sawyer befriends a man named Munson, sentenced for a white-collar crime. On behalf of the police, he cons Munson into revealing where he hid the money he stole; as a result, Sawyer's sentence is cut short, and the monetary reward he receives is deposited in an anonymous bank account for Clementine at his request. Later, as Sawyer is seducing another woman, another partner (played by Robert Patrick) informs him of the whereabouts of the original Sawyer who conned his parents. Sawyer travels to Australia to confront the man, and shoots him. Before he dies, Sawyer realizes his partner had conned him into killing someone who owed money to an important person. Sawyer also encounters and drinks with Christian Shephard at a bar. While in Australia, Sawyer is arrested, at the same station visited by Boone, for assaulting Warren Truss, an Australian politician and leader of the National Party, during a bar fight. As a result, Sawyer is deported and banned from returning to Australia; he leaves on board Oceanic Flight 815, his seat number being 15D. ===After the crash=== Season One Upon crashing on the island, Sawyer almost instantly clashes with the other survivors. He initially accuses Sayid of being the terrorist who caused the crash. Despite this, he joins Sayid, along with Kate, Charlie, Boone and Shannon on a hike to send out a distress signal. Upon returning, Sawyer searches the plane wreck for anything and everything he can find and keeps them for himself, causing the other survivors to bargain with him for items. He and Jack clash over the attention of Kate on regular intervals. Kate claims to see through his attempts to make people hate him, until he shows her the letter he wrote but implies it was written to him by one of his victims; later she sees the date on the envelope and realizes he wrote the letter himself. After Jack is caught in a cave-in, Sawyer locates Kate in the jungle and eventually informs her. When Shannon experiences asthma attacks, Sawyer is immediately under suspicion of possessing her inhalers after Boone sees him with one of his belongings. After being interrogated by Sayid, he tells Kate that he doesn't have them, causing an enraged Sayid to stab him in the arm. Kate then confronts Sawyer regarding his selfish actions, and tells him to change his ways by cooperating more with the survivors. He reluctantly agrees. In the jungle, Sawyer and Kate discover a case, carried on the plane by the marshal, and the two constantly fight over its ownership, until Jack takes it from Sawyer. Soon after, Sawyer becomes constantly harassed by a boar, and seeks Kate's help in finding it. Upon cornering it, however, Sawyer decides to let it go. After learning about Michael's plan to build a raft, Sawyer asks for a place on board, to which he is granted. However, after someone (later revealed as Walt) sets the raft on fire, Sawyer and Michael blame Jin and Sawyer takes him to the beach with the intent of beating him. Once the matter is solved, Sawyer experiences headaches and, after consulting Jack, is prescribed reading glasses, made from pairs found in the wreckage. His voice also calms the newborn of survivor Claire. The day before the raft sets sail, Sawyer and Kate clash once more, this time over his place on the raft. While Kate placed a good argument, Sawyer revealed her past life as a criminal to the survivors, securing his space on the raft. The next day, Sawyer, Michael, Walt and Jin set sail on the raft. When a piece of the raft breaks off, Sawyer is the first in the water to retrieve and re- attach it. He also begins reading through the survivors' personal messages, kept in a bottle. That night, they encounter a small boat and begin celebrating their rescue. However, they soon reveal themselves as the Others, and demand they hand over Walt. In an attempt to prevent Walt's abduction, Sawyer is shot in the shoulder before the raft is destroyed by the Others, who leave with Walt. Season Two Sawyer and Michael are stranded at sea with the wreckage of the raft. Sawyer removes the bullet from his shoulder prior to arriving back on the island, encountering the tail section survivors from the plane and being thrown into a pit. Once the mishap is cleared, Sawyer, Michael and Jin are released and forced into leading them to the fuselage camp. Throughout the journey, Sawyer constantly clashes with leader Ana Lucia, until he passes out from his bullet wound. He is then carried via hand-made stretcher until the death of Shannon, where he is carried by Mr. Eko into the hatch. He is cared for by Kate, until her father, Wayne, is channeled through Sawyer. Upon recovering, Sawyer reluctantly must seek Jack's medical expertise on a regular basis. On one such occasion, Sawyer releases Jack and Locke from the armory after Michael locks them in to search for Walt alone. Sawyer agrees to join them as they follow, only to encounter the Others. After revealing to have Kate held hostage, Sawyer, Jack and Locke reluctantly hand over their guns for her safety. Unlike Jack, Sawyer sympathizes with Kate's actions. Soon after, Sawyer sets up a long con, with the help of Charlie, in order to gain possession of the camp's entire firearms and medicine, using Sun as a victim of a faked abduction attempt. Upon succeeding this feat, Sawyer is challenged by Jack to a game of poker with the medicine as the prize, which Jack wins. Sawyer later gives Sun a pregnancy test upon request, and informs Bernard and Jin about her suspected pregnancy. Sawyer also uses his possession of the medicine to his advantage, and mocks Hurley when he admits to seeing things, only for his tirade to backfire. He also refuses to help Bernard create an S.O.S. sign on the beach. He is soon confronted by Ana Lucia, demanding he give her a gun. She seduces him, and steals his own gun from him. Upon discovering this, Sawyer, along with Jack, Locke and Kate, head for the hatch, where they discover Michael injured, Libby fatally wounded and Ana Lucia already dead. Michael asks Sawyer if he will go with him to the Others' camp, to which he agrees. After the funeral of Ana Lucia and Libby, Sawyer joins Michael, Jack, Kate and Hurley on the trek, where they are suddenly ambushed by the Others, tied up and taken to a pier. While Michael (along with Walt) leave the island, and Hurley is released, Sawyer is taken away by the Others, along with Jack and Kate. Season Three Sawyer wakes in the Others' camp, imprisoned in a cage originally designed to hold polar bears. Karl, a teenager being held in the cage across from Sawyer's, helps Sawyer to figure out the mechanism in his cage so he can gain access to food and water. Karl then helps him to escape, but Juliet shoots Sawyer in the neck with a tranquilizer dart and he is returned to his cage. Karl is taken away, and Kate is placed in the cage vacated by Karl. Sawyer and Kate are forced to mine and haul rocks for the Others. During this manual labor, Sawyer kisses Kate, even though he gets beaten for it by Danny Pickett. Pickett, one of the Others, dislikes Sawyer, blaming him for the death of his wife. Sawyer and Kate concoct an escape plan, but they are prevented from acting on it when Sawyer is knocked unconscious by Ben. The Others operate on Sawyer, implanting a pacemaker which will malfunction and kill him if his heart rate exceeds 140 beats per minute. He is told if he does not cooperate, Kate will be given a pacemaker too. Because of this, Sawyer does not defend himself when Pickett violently beats him up. Kate realizes she can slip out between top bars of her cage, but Sawyer refuses to escape with her. Instead of fleeing on her own, she returns to her cage. Later, Ben reveals to Sawyer that he has been conned, and there is no pacemaker in his heart. Ben informs Sawyer they are on a smaller island, separated by a stretch of open ocean from the island on which their plane crashed. Sawyer realizes how inescapable the island is, and is returned to his cage. Kate opens Sawyer's cell but Sawyer again refused to leave, knowing how futile it would be to try. They have sex, and while Ben is unconscious, having a tumor removed by Jack, Pickett takes the opportunity to finally kill Sawyer. However, Jack threatens to let Ben die unless Kate and Sawyer are released. Sawyer turns the tables on Pickett, beats him up, and he and Kate escape. Alex Rousseau helps them hide in the jungle in return for freeing Karl (her boyfriend), and gives them a canoe to escape in. Right before they leave the beach, Pickett finally catches up with them, but is shot dead by Juliet, who Ben ordered to help them escape. Back on the main island, Sawyer and Kate argue over his decision to leave Jack behind (and also to let Karl go free). At the survivors' camp, Sawyer keeps his distance from Kate and helps Hurley, Jin, and Charlie in repairing an abandoned Dharma truck Hurley found in the jungle. Back at the camp, he discovers Kate has gone off with Sayid and Locke in order to rescue Jack. He and Hurley develop a friendship, often playing table tennis together. Hurley surprises Sawyer by announcing with Jack, Locke, Kate, and Sayid gone, the rest of the survivors are looking to Sawyer to lead them. Sawyer rises to the challenge and bonds with the other survivors. When Kate and Jack finally return, Sawyer is outraged they have brought Juliet along. He and Sayid attempt to get information on the Others out of her, but they ultimately fail. Sawyer resumes his relationship with Kate but suspects she is using him to make Jack jealous. One night Locke tells Sawyer that he has captured Ben, and takes Sawyer to the Black Rock, locking him in a room with a bound and gagged stranger. This man, not Ben, reveals he is Anthony Cooper (Locke's father), a conman who reveals he went by name \\"Tom Sawyer.\\" Sawyer realizes this is the man whom he has been searching for. After Cooper mocks his letter of vengeance, Sawyer strangles him to death in a fit of anger. With no more use for the nickname \\"Sawyer,\\" he begins to call himself James again, though others continue to refer to him as Sawyer. Locke presents him with a tape showing Juliet is still working for Ben, and the Others are preparing a raid on the survivors. When Sawyer shows the tape to Jack at their camp, Jack reveals he knows about the raid, and Juliet has been working with him to double-cross the Others. Sawyer and several survivors hike across the jungle to the radio tower. Sayid, Jin, and Bernard stay behind to thwart the Others, and end up captured. Sawyer decides to go back with Juliet to rescue them. With the help of Hurley and the Dharma truck, their rescue is a complete success. Two of the Others are killed and the third, Tom, is captured before Sawyer shoots him out of vengeance for 'taking the kid off the raft.' Season Four When Desmond breaks the news about Charlie's death, Sawyer attempts to comfort Hurley, though his efforts are rejected. Although originally unsure of the meaning of Charlie's dying message, \\"Not Penny's Boat,\\" when the survivors split Sawyer chooses to go with Locke to the Barracks, telling Kate he was simply doing what he's always done: surviving. While holding Kate hostage in Ben's house on Locke's orders, Sawyer tells Kate he doesn't wish to return to the real world, seeing as he has nothing for him back there. He then proceeds to tell Kate she should do the same, and that they could try to start a life on the island. Kate leaves after Sawyer is relieved that she isn't pregnant, reasoning that they wouldn't be able to handle a baby. They have an argument and part on bad terms as Kate returns to the beach. Later on, a group of people from the boat arrive at the barracks to capture Ben. Ben, Locke, Hurley and Aaron take refuge in Ben's house and they barricade the door. Sawyer runs to retrieve Claire who is still sleeping alone in her house and watches in horror as it is blown up by the Freighters. He finds Claire alive under the ruins and proceeds to run back to Ben's house. After Alex is murdered by Keamy and Ben unleashes the smoke monster on the attackers, Sawyer decides to go back to Jack and the others on the beach. Claire, Aaron and Miles go with him. Hurley was going to go with Sawyer as well, but Locke, pointing a gun at Sawyer, forces Hugo to stay with him. After Sawyer warns Locke not to hurt \\"a single hair on his [Hugo's] curly head,\\" he leads the rest of the group back to the beach. Sawyer, Claire and Miles soon come across the bodies of Danielle and Karl. After leaving the area, they decide to settle down to make camp, however during the night Claire takes off into the jungle. Sawyer wakes up the following morning and Miles tells him Claire walked into the jungle in the middle of the night with someone she called \\"Dad\\". A short while later he hears Aaron crying and runs off to find him alone in the jungle. Sawyer and Miles, along with Aaron, continue on where they meet Jack and Kate in a small field. Jack and Kate were in the process of moving towards the helicopter from the freighter, with Jack inadvertently thinking the dropped satellite phone from Frank was a message to follow the crew. Sawyer then informs Jack and Kate that Claire walked off and the freighter's crew are up to no good. He hands Aaron over to Kate and tells her to go back to the beach with Miles and the infant, while he insists on going with Jack to face Charles Widmore's men. The two then find the helicopter, discover Frank handcuffed to the seats, and are told the men are heading towards Ben. Sawyer then tells Jack that Hurley is with Ben and the two head off to rescue Hurley. Jack and Sawyer eventually find Hurley and Locke at the Dharma Orchid station. After Jack finishes talking with Locke, Sawyer and Hurley meet up with Kate, Sayid, and Frank at the helicopter. En route to the freighter Frank notices that the helicopter is quickly losing fuel due to a bullet hole in the gas tank. The passengers ditch all unnecessary items to lighten the load, but Frank declares it will not be enough. Sawyer whispers something to Kate, he gives her a goodbye kiss, and he then bails out of the helicopter to give the others a chance of escape. Sawyer swims back to the Island and encounters Juliet, who directs his attention to smoke coming from the ruins of the freighter. As the two lie on the beach drinking rum they disappear with the vanished Island. ===After the Island=== After the Oceanic Six (Jack, Kate, Hurley, Sun, Sayid and Aaron) leave the Island, flashforwards in \\"Something Nice Back Home\\" reveal Kate is doing undisclosed favors for Sawyer, who, according to Jack, \\"chose to stay on the island\\". ===Season Five=== After the flash Before the strange flash, James and Juliet meet up with Charlotte, Miles, Rose, Bernard and the other 815 survivors and they discover their camp is somehow missing. James is then introduced to Daniel Faraday, who tells him the camps are not gone but that it hasn't been built yet and whatever Ben did in the Orchid station has made them constantly shift through time. They are in the past. The group set out to find a man-made landmark on the Island to determine where they are in time. After several more flashes, the team decide to head back to the beach. At the beach, they are attacked by a barrage of flaming arrows, resulting in several casualties. The group ultimately splits up, with James and Juliet heading toward the creek together. There they are attacked by three strangers. They demand answers, and even threatens to cut off Juliet's hand to emphasize their impatience, when Locke arrives to kill one and injure the other two. James, Juliet, and Locke question the two attackers and Juliet discover they are Others when they speak Latin to each other. They arrive at a camp where Richard Alpert is leading his people and he has Charlotte, Daniel and Miles held captive. The year is 1954. When an Other called Ellie takes Daniel at gunpoint to try to disarm a hydrogen bomb called Jughead, James holds a gun at her in order to rescue him. He then discovers Daniel had told Ellie they are from the future and are not part of the American military which the Others had believed they were. Suddenly, there is yet another flash and the Others including Ellie and Richard disappear. James and the rest see Charlotte bleed from her nose and collapse. James watches as Juliet and Daniel attempt to wake up Charlotte, who eventually comes around. James and Locke decide to head to the Orchid Station, believing a way to stop the jumps is there. When they return to the beach they discover the camp is back but has been abandoned and they also find a rowing boat on which they decide to use to get to the Orchid. However whilst rowing they are attacked by unknown assailants from behind ‚Äì Juliet manages to shoot one of the attackers but before anything else can happen there is another flash. The assailants are gone, and they are rowing in the rain. Later on, the team is reunited with Jin, last seen in the season four finale, who is alive. Along with Jin the team then continue on to Orchid where the flashes become worse and becomes painful for all the castaways, and not just Charlotte. They arrive, but a flash moves the island to a point before the Orchid was built. With the guidance of Charlotte, who collapsed earlier due to a deteriorating mental state and stay behind with Daniel, they find a well which leads to the Frozen Donkey Wheel. As Locke lowers himself into the well, another flash engulfs the Island. This causes all parts of the well, except the rope James grabbed on, to disappear. In a frenzy, James starts digging at the ground where the rope is, but Juliet stops James, and tells him Locke is gone. 1974 Locke then goes into a cave and turns the crank, which Ben originally turned, and the island stops moving through time. James, Juliet, Miles and Jin head back to Daniel, who informs them Charlotte has died due to violent shifts through time. As they all head back to the beach they hear the sound of gunshots and a woman screaming. Approaching the source of the commotion they see two men holding a woman hostage with a bag over her head after just killing her male companion. James and Juliet aim their guns at the men and tell them to stand down but when one of the men takes a shot at James both he and Juliet kill the men in self-defense. James releases the woman, who introduces herself as Amy. She tells them they need to bury the men they killed and to take her husband's body back to her people in order to keep a truce. As the team and the woman called Amy trudge back, they approach a sonic fence. Amy appears to turn off the machine and walk through it without being harmed. However James, Juliet, Daniel, Miles and Jin walk through and are all knocked unconscious. Amy is revealed to be wearing earplugs. James later wakes up in a house on a couch. A man named Horace Goodspeed (Doug Hutchison) demands to know who he and his friends are. Having previously experience with lying, he tells Horace his name is Jim LaFleur and he was a captain of a ship which had crashed on the island while on its way to Tahiti. Horace, believing his story, tells him a submarine is departing from the Island the next day and that James and his friends must be on it. James asks if he could search for his \\"other friends,\\" but his plea is denied. It appears Horace and Amy are part of the DHARMA Initiative. Later that night, Richard Alpert enters the Barracks, DHARMA's homes, to demand where his two men, the ones James and Juliet killed, are buried. James decides to take control of the situation and he walks up to Richard alone. He explains to Richard he is not from DHARMA and he is friends with John Locke, who had met Richard a few years prior during an earlier flash. He gives the flustered Richard information able to fully convince the latter. James also tells Richard that he was forced to kill his men in self-defense; Richard however tells him his people are livid and want some justice; Amy agrees to give Richard the body of Paul, her husband, in order to keep the truce. The agreement is made; Richard leaves. It appears the present time is 1974, at the peak of the DHARMA Initiative's presence on the Island. Both DHARMA and the Others are in a truce, stating they must respect their own privacy on the Island. A relieved and obliged Horace kindly informs James he and his fellow survivors can stay on the Island for two more weeks in order to search for his friends (Locke), before boarding the next submarine off the Island. James and Juliet share a quiet moment at the dock, the latter telling the former her longing to leave the Island is at its peak. She wants to leave on the next submarine, but James reminds her she has nothing to go back to, since they are thirty years back. Juliet consents to staying. 1977 Three years pass, and James is still on the Island along with his friends. They are all working for DHARMA, and for the most part they are contented living at the Barracks, especially James, who shares a home with Juliet. He is the head of security and an apparently trustworthy figure, using his alias \\"Jim LaFleur.\\" One morning, he receives a call from Jin regarding the return of Jack, Kate, and Hurley, having returned to the Island and to the past. Stunned, he goes out to meet them at a grassy field far from the Barracks, and there he tells them of his position within DHARMA and the present time of 1977. Kate's return makes him realize that despite being apart for 3 years and having fallen for Juliet, he is still has feelings for Kate, and becomes torn between her and Juliet. In order to smuggle them into DHARMA, Sawyer instructs the three to dress up in appropriate clothing and pretend to be new recruits for DHARMA so as to avoid awkward questions and the Hostiles, DHARMA's name of choice for the Others. Later Sayid, (last seen in 316), who also traveled back in time, is caught in the jungle and is mistaken by DHARMA as a Hostile. James is pressured to execute him for violating the code of truce between DHARMA and the Hostiles, but he has him locked in a cell and quietly contemplates a plan to free him. Sayid escapes a few days later with the help of eleven-year-old Ben. After the former shoots the latter and runs off, Jin carries the boy back to the Barracks, where he is treated with minimal success at the infirmary. James alerts Jack and pleads him to help, but his request is snubbed. Eventually, James and Kate take the unconscious boy to the Others, believing they can provide the only cure. After doing so, with the caveat Ben will never be the same again, James asks Miles through the surveillance camera at the border between DHARMA's area and the Others' territory to remove the tape containing footage of Ben being taken away. The two return to the Barracks afterward. James is alerted of Roger Linus's, Ben's father, suspicions, and begins to worry about what may come next. Security staff member Phil (Patrick Fischler) confronts James and shows him the tape mentioned earlier, this proving Miles failed James' order. James knocks him out in response and keeps him tied up and gagged in the closet. The next day, he holds a meeting with only the Oceanic Six survivors and Juliet and reluctantly tells them his comfortable life within DHARMA is ending, thanks to Jack, Kate, and Hurley. He wants to return the beach and start over. However, following the events in The Variable, Radzinsky, an antagonistic engineer of DHARMA's, discovers Phil in the closet and ties up James and Juliet in two chairs, furiously demanding answers. James refuses to comply, forcing Radzinsky to violently beat him, even with Horace pleading him not to. When Dr. Pierre Chang (Francois Chau) disrupts the interrogation to order everyone to leave the Island because of impending danger, James requests the women and children get on the submarine and leave. He also agrees to tell everyone everything on the condition he and Juliet also get spots on the sub. An agreement is made; they get on board, James hoping never to turn back. Unfortunately, Kate also gets on, informing him and Juliet of Jack's intentions to detonate a hydrogen bomb which will decimate the Island and alter the past so Oceanic 815 will never crash twenty-seven years from now. Very reluctantly, James agrees to help stop Jack, and the three secretly leave the sub and head back to the beach. After briefly meeting up with Rose and Bernard (last seen in The Lie) and leaving them, they confront Jack, Hurley, Sayid, Jin, and Miles. James drags Jack to a secluded area and tells him that he, James, could have stopped Anthony Cooper from conning his parents and thus preventing their deaths a year ago, but asserts what is done is done, and Jack should do the same in his case. When Jack rebuffs, they get into a fistfight which continued until Juliet intervenes. Much to James' vexation, Juliet agrees with Jack. Juliet tells James she will never lose him if she does not know him. As Jack prepares to go to the constructing Swan Station to drop the bomb on the electromagnetic source, Phil and his men spot him and try to shoot him down. James, Juliet, Kate, and Miles come to Jack's aid, and an intense gunfight ensues. DHARMA's men are besieged, and James urges Jack to go ahead and discharge the bomb. However, the bomb does not go off, and the electromagnetic source is activated, causing pandemonium. Phil nearly kills James, but is stabbed dead by a rebar in the process. Amidst the chaos, James spots Juliet falling in the chasm and in danger of getting sucked in. He and Kate grasp her hands and he tells her to not to leave him, but the force becomes too strong, causing pain for all of them. Juliet tells James she loves him and releases her clutch, dropping down to the bottom where she cannot be seen. James sobs hysterically, not registering himself, even when Kate and Jack drag him back up. ===Season 6=== 2007 In the premiere of season 6, James wakes up in the middle of the jungle and finds out he and the rest of the group traveled back to 2007. They discover the Swan imploded, just like they left it in 2004. James realizes the plan didn't work and Juliet died for no reason, and he beats Jack. They all fall into the hole where the hatch door was supposed to be, and Kate suddenly hears moaning coming from underneath the steel, which leads her to believe Juliet may still be alive. After removing all the pieces of metal, James climbs down and finds a heavily bleeding Juliet. She asks him to kiss her, and after doing so, Juliet dies in his arms. James buries her with Miles' help, but really wants him to implement his medium skills to find out what Juliet's dying words were supposed to be. Miles says Juliet told him \\"it worked,\\" to which James pouts. Later, he and Miles are captured by the Others, but not before taking down several of them as Miles proclaimed. They are taken to the Temple, the Others' vicinity and only safe location from the Smoke Monster. In his anger over Juliet's death, he tells the Others to do whatever they want with his friends, whom he proclaims are no longer his friends to this point, and leaves. Kate goes after him, following him back to the Barracks and what used to be his and Juliet's house. When James and Kate sit on the docks, he confesses he planned on asking Juliet to marry him, having a ring and all. He admits to Kate he should have let Juliet leave with the sub when she asked him to, back in 1974, but made her stay because he didn't want to be alone. He also tells Kate he doesn't blame her for Juliet's death. He throws the ring in the ocean and then leaves, telling Kate that he will not help her on her mission to find Claire. He spends his time playing loud music from his record player and drinking. When the Smoke Monster shows up, in the form of Locke, James is not entirely surprised about it, but suspects he is not Locke, judging by the way he talks. The Man in Black persuades him to follow him to a part of the Island to answer the most important question of all: \\"Why is (James) on the Island?\\" They then head off; James spots a boy in the jungle and the Man in Black is perturbed to know he can see him too. While the Man in Black runs after the mysterious boy, James meets Richard, who frantically asks him to come along to the Temple. James refuses, and Richard, hearing the Man in Black coming back, runs off. They climb down a cliff to a cave. James sees a scale with a black stone and a white stone, the Man in Black throwing into the sea the latter. The Man in Black then shows James mysterious carvings on the cave ceiling; among them are the surnames of John, Hurley, James (himself), Sayid, Jack, and Sun. The Numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42 correspond to a surname, for Locke, Reyes, Ford, Jarrah, Shephard and Kwon, respectively. James is informed Jacob picked and manipulated those people at various points in their lives to have them show up on the Island. James is a candidate to take up the mantle of leader of the Island; thus, he is given three choices: do nothing, become leader of the Island, or leave the Island with the Man in Black. James firmly chooses the third choice. He follows the Man in Black to Claire's camp, Claire being a follower of the former. James agrees with Jin he will help look for Sun. The Man in Black then sends him to the other Island, dubbed \\"Hydra Island\\" to look for survivors of the Ajira Airways Flight 316. Arriving there, James greets Zoey (Sheila Kelley), who tells him she is the remaining survivor. However, James learns she is lying and demands answers, until a cavalcade of armed men appear and escort him to their leader, Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), who has returned on a submarine. James makes a deal with Widmore: he will lead the Man in Black into a trap in exchange for safe passage away from the island. He travels back to the main island and tells the Man in Black about the deal he made, stating he is loyal to the Man in Black. However, he later reveals his true plan to Kate: to turn both sides against each other and escape on the submarine while both sides are distracted. When the Man in Black leaves to recruit Sun, James tries to stop Jin from leaving camp, until a barrage of tranquilizers bring them down. Jin is taken away by Widmore's team, who has been spying on them, and James tries to remain calm as the situation reaches higher levels of strain. In the series finale, James escapes the island on an airplane piloted by Frank Lapidus, along with Kate Austen, Claire Littleton, Richard Alpert and Miles Straume. ===Afterlife=== After James' untold death at a later date, he appears in the alternate timeline in 2004. James is on the plane along with the rest of the passengers and has a conversation with Hurley. He somewhat flirts with Kate, a fugitive again, escorted by Edward Mars. Later on, after the plane lands, James and Kate share an elevator at the airport, him noticing the handcuffs around her wrists and realizing her criminal status. When security guards enter the elevator, James helps Kate escape them, knowing she's on the run. As it turns out, James is actually a policeman from the LAPD. His partner is Miles. However, his back story involving his parents' death at the hands of Anthony Cooper remains unchanged (as shown in his blind date with Charlotte Lewis), and he is adamant on hunting Cooper down and killing him. He had traveled to Australia to look for him, under the pretense he went to Palm Springs, as he had told Miles. However, Miles finds out the truth and threatens to sever their partnership unless James tells him about the trip to Australia. Later, in his car James tells Miles everything, including his yearn to kill Cooper. Miles objects, but before James can respond, a car crashes into his and its driver runs off. The two cops pursue, and James apprehends the driver, Kate. Along with Kate, James and Miles arrest Sayid, their only suspect in the killing of Martin Keamy and his men. Sun was shot during the battle and was included in the report. After Desmond runs over Locke with his car and attacks Ben, he turns himself in to James. The three (Sayid, Kate and Desmond) are then told they are being transported to County Prison. Before the concert begins in the final episode, The End, Miles sees Sayid in the passenger seat of Hurley's car. He notifies James, who then believes Sayid is after Sun, at the hospital. When James arrives, Sun and Jin are preparing to leave. He notifies them of the possibility of Sun being Sayid's target but they both re-assure him she is safe. Before they leave the hospital room, Jin tells James, \\"We'll see you there\\", which leaves him confused. He leaves the room shortly after and bumps into Jack asking him if he knows where to get some food around here. Jack tells him the cafeteria is closed but there are vending machines at the end of the corridor to which he responds, \\"thanks Doc\\". A connection was seen between the two but nothing played out. The candy he chooses gets stuck so he tries to reach it using the tray at the bottom. Juliet arrives at the same moment and gives her advice to unplug the machine and the candy will fall. While unplugging the machine, there is a short and the entire room's electricity goes off. Juliet then tells him it worked and while handing him the candy, they both flash. They begin to recall the last few words they said to each other about getting coffee, and they touch again, which allows them to remember what occurred. They embrace, hug, and kiss and are later seen at the church with the other main characters. James and Juliet move on to the next phase of the afterlife together, as soulmates. == Personality == Sawyer is not initially liked by the other survivors due to his narcissistic personality, rude attitude, and his habit of calling everyone by offensive nicknames. He keeps a stash of such items as Whiskey and pornography, which he had stolen from the wreckage. He is manipulative of his fellow survivors. it is revealed after the kiss that he never had the medication in the first place. It is also hard for him to work with other people, a quality essential for surviving on the island, and is quoted saying \\"every man for himself\\" when he is expected to help Jack escape from The Others in season three. However, he grows more mature and caring in the later seasons, mostly because of his love for Kate, and, later, his own leadership role on the island and his relationship with Juliet. He shows his emotional side occasionally in the earlier seasons, too, especially in the flashbacks. He is very often depicted reading books, a habit that contrasts with his \\"redneck\\" side. ==Development== Sawyer was originally a slick conman who wore a Prada suit. Midway through his audition for the role, Josh Holloway forgot his lines and kicked a chair in frustration. He managed to remember his lines after this and finished reading the monologue. The producers knew he didn't suit the role, but thought he was very watchable, so they rewrote the role to suit him, making him more feral, Southern, and kept the same intelligence he originally had. Matthew Fox, Jorge Garcia and Dominic Monaghan read Sawyer's lines when they came in to audition because there was no existing script for their characters.\\"Before They Were Lost\\". Lost: The Complete First Season, Buena Vista Home Entertainment. September 6, 2005. Featurette, disc 7. Damon Lindelof has stated that Sawyer was written as a character whom audiences were supposed to care about even if his behavior was not sympathetic ‚Äì \\"He's an asshole, but he acts as an asshole because of the horrible things that happened to him as a kid\\".Lost on Location ‚Äì \\"Confidence Man\\". Lost: The Complete First Season ‚Äì The Extended Experience, Buena Vista Home Entertainment. Featurette, disc 7. Released on September 6, 2005. The character flashbacks would try to follow the same spirit of the character, \\"a humorously engaging rascal ‚Äî but who did have this sort of darkness to him\\", while showing what made Sawyer \\"a man who's hell-bent on revenge, like an Ahab model.\\" == References== Category:Fictional con artists Category:Lost (TV series) characters Category:Fictional characters from Alabama Category:Fictional orphans Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional smokers Category:Fictional victims of kidnapping Category:Fictional sole survivors Category:Fictional Los Angeles Police Department detectives Category:Television characters introduced in 2004 Category:Male characters in television Category:Time travelers ","title":"James &quot;Sawyer&quot; Ford"},{"id":"2231015","text":"Canucks Sports & Entertainment, previously known as Orca Bay Sports & Entertainment, is a Canadian sports and entertainment company in Vancouver, British Columbia that owns and operates the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League and the Vancouver Warriors of the National Lacrosse League team and their home arena, Rogers Arena. ==History== As Vancouver executive Arthur Griffiths overspent building General Motors Place, where the NHL's Vancouver Canucks and the upcoming NBA expansion Vancouver Grizzlies would play, on March 1995 he associated with Seattle billionaire John McCaw, Jr. - then a co- owner of the Seattle Mariners - to form the Northwest Entertainment Group, which would control both teams and the arena.of Seattle today formed the Northwest Entertainment Group Attention News Sports Editors: NEW NORTHWEST ENTERTAINMENT GROUP PARTNERSHIP FORMED FOR NHL'S CANUCKS, NBA'S GRIZZLIES AND GENERAL MOTORS PLACE ...Arthur R.

Jin had since been told that his mother died when he was young. Even though he was not sure about being Jin's father, the fisherman raised Jin, knowing that no one else would. As an adult, Jin attempted to follow his dreams of owning his own restaurant and hotel, and applied for a job at Seoul Gateway Hotel. Jin's heritage is recognized by the owner who employs him as a doorman, under strict instructions to keep \\"people like him\\" out of the hotel. When Jin allowed a disheveled man's son to use the hotel toilets, the owner rebuked him, prompting Jin to quit on the spot. Shortly after leaving, Jin literally bumped into Sun Paik (Yunjin Kim). After finding work as a waiter elsewhere, Jin visited Sun's father to ask for her hand in marriage. Jin disowned his heritage in order to gain Mr. Paik's respect, and in doing so was given a job as a floor manager in one of his factories. Sun and Jin were wed, and at their wedding reception, unknowingly spoke with Jacob, who congratulated them and told them (in fluent Korean, to the amusement of the couple) to never take each other, or their love, for granted. Two months after marrying Sun, Jin was assigned to present an associate with a stuffed panda to congratulate a newborn, a task in which Jin was faced with various obstructions. Later Jin was promoted to working as an \\"enforcer\\" for Mr. Paik, who had no qualms about the use of bribery, blackmail, extortion, and murder to succeed. While Jin was unaware as to the reason of his sudden promotion, it put a strain on his relationship with Sun. Jin's first assignment was to \\"convince\\" a government official to overlook the violating environmental regulations caused by one of Paik's factories. Jin gave the official's puppy to Sun as a gift, but on the second visit, Jin violently beat him to prevent a hitman from killing him. Jin returned home covered in blood, but refrained from telling Sun about the work her father ordered him to do. Despite their problems, Jin and Sun tried to conceive children. However; after a visit with a fertility doctor, Jin grew angry upon learning that Sun could not conceive, and accused her of knowing all along. The doctor later admitted to Sun that the opposite was true, that Jin was the one who was sterile. The doctor was afraid to reveal this to Jin for fear of retribution, as he knew of Jin's work for Mr. Paik. Later, Paik ordered Jin to kill Jae Lee, though he did not reveal to Jin the reason (he was having an affair with Sun). Following orders, Jin confronted Jae Lee at his hotel room and violently beat him. Instead of killing him; however, Jin told him to leave the country and never return. Upon returning to his car, Jin was startled when Jae Lee landed on his car after jumping from his hotel room as a supposed act of suicide. Later, Jin was assigned on a secret mission to deliver watches to two of Mr. Paik's associates in Sydney and Los Angeles. Jin took Sun with him, telling her that it was a vacation. Before leaving Korea, Jin visited his estranged father, much to his delight. Jin told his father about the turmoil that had plagued his life since being employed by Mr. Paik. Jin's father told him to remain in the United States upon arrival and never return. Jin decided to follow through with this plan. After checking in at the airport in Sydney, Jin used the restrooms after Sun accidentally spilled coffee on him. As Jin was washing his hands, he was approached by one of Mr. Paik's associates (a Caucasian who shocked Jin by speaking Korean to him), who revealed he knew Jin's hidden agenda, and warned him to deliver the watches or risk losing Sun. Jin then moved on to board the doomed flight. ===After the crash=== Season one Upon landing on the island, Jin becomes overprotective of Sun, and forbids her from consorting with the other survivors. Whenever she is approached, Jin scolds her for her poor appearance (most notably when her top button is undone). While the two remain isolated from the others, Jin prepares sea urchin and offers it to the survivors, the only one to turn him down being Hurley (Jorge Garcia). Jin spends most of his time fishing, whilst also keeping a watchful eye over his wife. One morning, Jin assaults Michael (Harold Perrineau, Jr.) and attempts to kill him in front of his son, Walt (Malcolm David Kelley). Jin is handcuffed to the wreckage as a result, released only after Michael cuts him free and returns his gold watch to him. (For this reason, Jin continues to wear one handcuff around his wrist, until it is cut off partway into the second season). Later, Jin and Sun move into the caves. When Jack (Matthew Fox) is caught in a cave in, Jin contributes in moving the rubble aside. He soon frowns upon Sun wearing revealing clothes, and even more so when she helps Shannon (Maggie Grace) overcome her asthma. Later, Jin grabs Sun and yells at her when she decides to go bathing. It is only after Michael intervenes that Jin suspects something going on between the two. That night, Michael's raft is burned down. Jin helps in stopping the flames, but flees to the caves when his hands are scorched. Regardless, Michael blames Jin for the arson attack, and he and Sawyer (Josh Holloway) take their anger out on him by beating him in front of the whole camp. It is only after Sun, revealing her secret to Jin, begs them to stop that Jin is released. He returns to the caves to collect his belongings, blanking out Sun, and joins Michael in building a second raft. Over time, the two begin bonding, eventually becoming mutual friends. Jin stops building the raft only when he hears the distress calls from Kate (Evangeline Lilly) and Claire (Emilie de Ravin) in the jungle, where he must help in delivering the baby. On the day that the raft sets sail, Sun approaches Jin and gives him a phrasebook she had written for him. Jin apologizes for his actions, and vows to find rescue for her. The two reconcile before departing. Out at sea, Jin helps to maintain the raft's condition. When they encounter the Others that night, Jin dives into the water in an attempt to save Sawyer. Season two Upon the raft's destruction, Jin washes ashore, being discovered by Libby (Cynthia Watros) and Cindy (Kimberley Joseph). He is taken into the jungle and tied to a tree. Jin breaks free and flees to the beach, encountering Michael and Sawyer. Believing the people to be Others, he attempts to warn the two, until the three are beaten unconscious by Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and thrown into a pit. Upon being released, and their situation mutual, the tail-section survivors lead Jin, Michael and Sawyer back to the Arrow station. Before heading off to migrate with the fuselage camp, Jin offers his expertise by catching fish with Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and Bernard (Sam Anderson). When Michael disappears in the jungle, Jin and Mr. Eko run after him, narrowly avoiding an encounter with the Others. The three catch up to the rest of the group, traveling up until Ana Lucia shoots Shannon. Jin is forced to remain behind with Libby and Bernard, until they are given the go-ahead to move on, and being reunited with Sun. The two attend Shannon's funeral. When Jin learns that Michael has gone off to search for Walt, Jin attempts to join the search party, but Sun forbids him to leave her again. Later, Jin grows concerned for his wife when she falls victim to a failed kidnap attempt. Jack and Jin intend to exact revenge on the Others, only for Sawyer to reveal that they had fallen for his long con. Still worried, Jin forbids Sun from tending to her garden, tearing it up in the process. Later, Jin realizes how much he needs her, and attempts to repair the garden. It is then that Sun informs him of her pregnancy, and that it was he who is infertile. Jin considers this a miracle and rejoices. Jin later volunteers to help Bernard build a giant S.O.S. sign in the beach. He is the last person remaining when he decides to quit. When Michael leads Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Hurley to the Others' camp, Sayid (Naveen Andrews) asks Jin to accompany him to the camp via Desmond's (Henry Ian Cusick) boat, to which he accepts only when Sun also insists on going. As they sail to the Other's camp, they pass a strange statue of a four-toed foot. They arrive at the camp, which turns out to be fake. Before setting off, Jin is deafened by a high-pitched noise as the island is engulfed in a strange violet glow. Season three Jin is still on board the boat with Sun and Sayid, and suggests they return to the beach, only to be overruled by Sun and Sayid. They arrive at the pier, where Sayid starts a signal fire. Jin, knowing about Sayid's plan, demands to be given a gun whilst telling Sun that he understands more English than she thinks. That night, Jin and Sayid wait by the end of the pier for the Others to arrive; they are startled to find that they have instead arrived by sea and have gone directly for the boat, where Sun is hiding. Jin ds into the water as the boat sails away, and is reunited with Sun once again when she escapes. The three return to the beach soon after. Days after returning, Sun starts speaking to Jin in English, in an attempt to help him learn. Jin is stubborn, and is left to help Hurley overturn a van in the jungle. When Sawyer arrives, he teaches Jin three phrases that he describes as \\"what women want to hear\\" (which are, incidentally, \\"I'm sorry\\", \\"You were right\\" and \\"Those pants don't make you look fat.\\") Hurley and Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) get the van running, and the four enjoy a joyriding session before returning to the beach, filled with hope. Jin finds himself involved in the investigation over the apparent deaths of survivors Nikki and Paulo (Kiele Sanchez and Rodrigo Santoro). Jin, Hurley and Sawyer find Paulo lying in the jungle. After a brief examination of the surroundings, Jin concludes that the \\"Monster\\" had killed him. Later, he attends the funeral, unaware that Nikki has opened her eyes moments before being buried. Upon Jack, Kate and Sayid returning to the beach with Juliet (Elizabeth Mitchell) in tow, Jin shares the same disliking to her as the rest of the camp. Later, Jin joins Hurley, Charlie and Desmond on a trek into the jungle. They witness the bailing of a helicopter pilot that night, and head inland to find them, encountering several pieces of luggage on the way. Jin and Hurley find her hanging from a tree, and the four cut her loose. When Mikhail (Andrew Divoff) arrives, Jin chases after him and catches him. After helping Naomi (Marsha Thomason), Jin pursues Mikhail once again when he steals her satellite phone. The four take her back to the camp and hide her in Hurley's tent. After she speaks to the camp that night, Juliet's recorder is played to the group, mentioning Sun's pregnancy. Jin asks Sun about Juliet's message, to which he learns of a healthy fetus. When Karl (Blake Bashoff) arrives to warn them of the Others' imminent arrival, Jin volunteers to stay behind and detonate the dynamite inside the targeted tents, along with Sayid and Bernard. That night, Jin's inaccuracy causes the plan to backfire, and three are taken hostage by the surviving Others. The next day, Jin is held at gunpoint in order for the Others to extract the camp's initial plan from Bernard. The three are saved when Hurley, Sawyer and Juliet arrive on the beach and eliminate the Others. Season four Shortly after confirmation that Jack has made contact with the freighter, Jin watches and listens as Desmond delivers Charlie's warning, and ventures into the jungle to meet up with the rest of the camp. After reuniting with Sun, Jin decides to return to the beach with Jack rather than join Locke (Terry O'Quinn) at the barracks. Jin and Sun discuss what they will name their baby, and Jin suggest Ji Yeon. Sun insists it's too early. After a conversation with Kate, Sun decides to head to Locke's camp. In hopes of stopping this Juliet reveals Sun's medical condition, and the affair she had to Jin. Although angry at first, Jin realizes that he was not supportive of Sun and that he pushed her away, so he forgives her and promises that he will never leave her. Later, Sayid returns with the speedboat to take people to the boat. Jin and Sun go with the first group, taking Aaron with them. On the boat, they encounter Michael for the first time since he left the island. Upon discovering a bomb on the boat, Jin, Michael and Desmond attempt to disarm it. While their attempts manage to stall the bomb's detonation, Jin is left on the boat during the bomb's detonation. The freighter explodes and sinks beneath the ocean leading to Sun and the rest of the Oceanic Six believing him to have died in the explosion. At the Oceanic 6 conference when a Korean reporter asks Sun if Jin survived the crash, Sun looks very somber and pauses for a minute before replying that he did not. Sun later buys a controlling share of her father's company as retribution for, in her view, his hand in Jin's death. Sun names her daughter Ji Yeon as Jin had asked. Jin's grave in Korea lists the date of the plane crash (Sept 22, 2004) as the date of his death. Season five In the fourth episode of the season, after another shift in time, Jin is found unconscious floating on some debris from the freighter by a group of people in a life raft, who turn out to be a young and pregnant Danielle Rousseau (Young: Melissa Farman; Older: Mira Furlan) along with her research team. After realizing who Danielle Rousseau is, Jin is shocked to realize he has traveled back in time to 1988. Jin travels with Danielle's group and leads them to the radio tower. On their way, the smoke monster appears in the middle of the jungle and kills a female member of her group called Nadine. The leader of the group, Montard is dragged down beneath the wall of the temple by the monster. The rest of the group decide to go rescue Montard, but Jin tells Danielle to stay. Suddenly, Jin is torn away through time in front of Danielle and reappears later, she kills the last of her group's survivors because she believes that they had become sick and \\"changed\\". She tries to kill Jin but he escapes. Another time jump allows him to meet up with Sawyer, Locke, Juliet, Faraday (Jeremy Davies), Miles (Ken Leung) and Charlotte (Rebecca Mader). Jin assists the group with Locke's plan to leave the island and return with the escapees. Threatening his seeming escape via a rope down a well, he makes him promise not to bring Sun back. =1970s= Soon after Locke is separated from the group Jin, Sawyer, Juliet and Miles get sent to an ancient time, in which a gigantic statue is seen standing far away from them. After Locke moves the Island by turning the frozen wheel, they get transported to 1974. They then head back to Daniel who informs them that the violent shifts through time had killed Charlotte but that they now had also stopped and wherever they are now they were there to stay. Jin and the others then rescue a woman from the DHARMA Initiative called Amy from two Others and they then move into the barracks with other DHARMA members. They are welcomed to stay there. Three years later, in 1977, Jin along with Sawyer (under the alias James LaFleur), Juliet, and Miles are all shown to be still there. Jin can now speak fluent English, as is shown in his conversation with Sawyer where he both understands and replies to Sawyer regarding John's quest to bring the others back. Jin's job is to search for Locke and their friends. For the three years there were no signs. But one morning, Jin drives across a waterfall and discovers Jack, Kate and Hurley and he drives all three of them to meet Sawyer. While on a perimeter check he notices the men fleeing into the bushes. He steps out of his vehicle to acknowledge little Ben (Young: Sterling Beaumon; Old: Michael Emerson), who is a reluctant member of DHARMA, and fugitive Sayid. Sayid says that LaFleur gave him the opportunity to run. As Jin calls LaFleur to confirm this Sayid attacks Jin and knocks him unconscious. Sayid leaves him and Ben behind after shooting Ben in the chest with Jin's sidearm. Jin later gains consciousness and brings Ben to the DHARMA infirmary. Later, Sawyer holds a meeting to decide what to do after their presence in the Dharma Initiative becomes risky. Eventually, the survivors decide to leave the DHARMA Initiative and start all over at the beach. However, their plan is foiled when Sawyer and Juliet are caught. Jin, Hurley, and Miles aid Jack and Sayid in taking them to the Swan Station construction site via DHARMA van, where they plan to detonate the electromagnetic pocket and prevent Oceanic 815 from ever crashing twenty- seven years from now. Jin is tending to a critically injured Sayid, who was shot by Ben's father (Jon Gries), when Juliet manages to detonate the hydrogen bomb, leaving all of their fate unknown. Season six Jin and his friends jump back through time to 2007, still on the Island, after the explosion. He joins Hurley, Jack, Miles, Kate, Sawyer and Sayid in the Temple, the Others' home, to stay protected from the Man in Black/Smoke Monster, but he wants to leave in order to find his wife who he has been told is also on the Island. When Sawyer leaves, he joins Kate and two Others to go look for him; after Kate knocks out the guards to leave the Temple forever, he decides to do the same in order to find Sun. However, the two Others attack him and while running away from them, he gets caught in an old bear trap, which happens to be Claire's. She kills the two Others. Jin is brought to Claire's home, a hut, where he is treated by Claire. He asks her of her survival on the Island for the past three years, growing suspicious of her. He then is greeted by the Man in Black, masquerading as Locke, whom Claire states is her \\"friend.\\" While still too hurt to walk and obviously a prisoner, Claire looks at Jin as a friend and even talks to the Man in Black about Jin as an ally to their cause to kill the Others. Jin is skeptical of the Man in Black and believes he is not Locke. When James, having been captured by the Man in Black, joins him, Jin tells his friend he wants to find Sun first, to which Sawyer agrees. However, Jin has no choice but to follow the Man in Black's group as they journey across the Island. Sawyer and the Man in Black tell him that he is a possible \\"candidate\\" of Jacob's (the leader of the Island and enemy of the Man in Black), meaning he may be chosen to watch the Island after Jacob's death. However, he is unaware of the Man in Black's intention to kill him, since he is a candidate. Late one night, while the Man in Black is off retrieving Sun (as she may be a candidate as well), Jin and the others are attacked by Charles Widmore's team. Tranquilized, Jin is brought over to the second Island where Widmore's submarine is docked. Jin wakes up inside a DHARMA Initiative complex and meets Zoe (Sheila Kelley), who eagerly asks him about his hand-drawn map of the electromagnetism pockets, which he drew back in 1977. However, he demands to see Widmore. Widmore greets Jin and hands him Sun's digital camera. On it, Jin tearfully views photographs of his daughter, seeing his girl for the first time. Widmore then explains to him that everyone will cease to exist should the Man in Black leave the Island, and that he himself is here to prevent that from happening. Jin asks how will he accomplish this, to which Widmore replies that they should see a \\"package.\\" When Sawyer's group (which consists of Sawyer, Sun, Claire, Kate, Hurley and Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), the helicopter pilot who appeared in seasons four and five) arrives, he finally reunites with his long-lost love, only for their reunion to be short-lived, when Widmore and Zoe decide to arrest Sawyer's group and Jin. The group is then thrown into the polar bear cages at the Hydra, but are rescued by the Man in Black, Sayid and Jack. Jin and some of the group enter Widmore's submarine to escape the island, leaving The Man in Black and Claire behind. A bomb is then revealed to be inside Jack's bag, which causes Sayid to run away from the group and explode with the bomb, causing water to gush in and sink the submarine. Sun becomes trapped under wreckage caused by the blast, so Sawyer, Jin and Jack try to free her, but they realize she cannot be removed. Another collision causes Sawyer to get knocked unconscious, causing Jin to plead with Jack to save Sawyer. Despite Sun's pleas for Jin to save himself, he decides to stay with her, they both drown. ===Afterlife / Flash-sideways=== In the afterlife, Jin works at Mr. Paik's company, and that is where he met Sun, eventually having an affair. Jin is assigned to deliver a watch and a wad of cash to deliver in a meeting. Jin is on Oceanic Airlines Flight 815, and Sun accompanies him. At Los Angeles International Airport, he fails to declare the cash at customs, since he couldn't understand English and does not know how to claim it. He misses the meeting in the process. Jin and Sun then go back to their hotel, and they both make out in Sun's room. The next morning, two men named Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) and Omar (Anthony Azizi) arrive to get the watch and the money. Since Keamy and Omar cannot understand them, they consult the help of translator Mikhail Bakunin, in which they explain the situation to the three. Sun and Mikhail go to the bank to get more money, and Keamy and Omar trap Jin in the freezer. When Sayid arrives, he kills Keamy and his men (including Omar), and help Jin escape. When Sun and Mikhail arrive, Jin kills Mikhail, but injures Sun in the process. Sun then confesses that she is pregnant. Sun eventually recovers at the hospital, and the baby is safe. When Juliet, their doctor does an ultrasound on their baby, they remember moments from the original timeline, and they perfectly speak English and call their baby \\"Ji Yeon.\\" They then unite with their friends from the original timeline in a church to move on. ==Development== Daniel Dae Kim described his audition as a \\"really interesting experience\\". He found it especially hard as it was his first time acting in Korean, and he hadn‚Äôt spoken in it regularly since being in high school, when he would talk to his parents.\\"Before They Were Lost\\". Lost: The Complete First Season, Buena Vista Home Entertainment. September 6, 2005. Featurette, disc 7. Jin is the only major character who could not speak English before arriving on the island (though he does speak it in one of Hurley's dream sequences), and has been receiving tutelage from Sun and Sawyer. Ironically, Daniel Dae Kim has the opposite problem: though Korean-born, he was raised in Pennsylvania, speaks English as his native language, and had to receive tutelage in Korean to prepare for the role. Despite Jin's inability to speak English, he can understand it better than most characters think, deducing that Sun and Sayid are lying to him in \\"The Glass Ballerina\\". He manages only rudimentary English by the end of season three, but by the end of season four, he can understand most of what is said to him, and can speak English with minimal difficulty. Furthermore, after living for three years on the island, as shown in the episode \\"LaFleur\\", he is fluent save for an accent. Military service for a minimum of twenty-one months is compulsory in South Korea.CIA - The World Factbook - Korea, South This, in addition to Jin's mob experience, may explain his familiarity with handguns as seen in \\"The Glass Ballerina\\" and \\"Through the Looking Glass.\\" ==Character Naming== Similarly to the Chinese and Japanese naming system, the convention in the Korean naming system is to put the family name first in the person's name. Therefore, Jin's name should technically be Kwon Jin-Soo or Kwon Jinsoo, rather than Jin-Soo Kwon. However, when his name is spoken in the Korean flashbacks, it is said in the Korean manner. == References == Category:Lost (TV series) characters Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Fictional fishers Category:Fictional gangsters Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional soldiers Category:Fictional Korean people Category:Fictional bodyguards Category:Fictional sole survivors Category:Male characters in television Category:Television characters introduced in 2004 Category:Time travelers ca:Personatges de Lost#Jin-Soo Kwon ","title":"Jin-Soo Kwon"},{"id":"2231019","text":"Sun-Hwa Kwon (n√©e Paik),Similar to the Chinese and the Japanese, the naming convention in the Korean naming system is to place the family name first in the person's name.

Lost, ABC. Episode 7, season 4. Aired on March 13, 2008. into the powerful Paik family; natives of Seoul. As a child, Sun was taught how to play the piano. On at least one occasion, she blamed the results of some mischief on a maid in order to avoid punishment. Later, Sun attended Seoul National University, majoring in Art History. When she returned without a husband, her mother arranged for her to meet a potential suitor, Jae Lee. The two hit it off until Jae Lee revealed that he planned on marrying an American woman. An upset Sun left him, only to quite literally bump into Jin- Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), her future husband. While Sun had doubts regarding her father's approval, she was surprised when Jin presented her with an engagement ring. They were wed in Korea, and at the reception, they were complimented by a Korean-speaking Jacob. Shortly after the wedding, however, Sun was approached by a woman claiming to be Jin's mother; she blackmailed Sun into paying her a large sum of money, with the threat of bringing shame upon the Paik family by revealing Jin to be the son of a fisherman and a prostitute. Sun asked her father for the money, but when she did not provide a reason, Mr. Paik assumed it was for Jin, and assigned him a new job until the debt was paid. Over time, Jin grew distant from Sun, and she planned on escaping her failing marriage. She began taking English lessons from Jae Lee, whose own plans had not worked out. After many lessons; the relationship between Sun and Jae Lee developed into an affair. The two were eventually found in bed together by Mr. Paik and the affair ended. Sun and Jin had been trying to conceive a child, but after visiting a fertility doctor, they were informed that Sun was unable to conceive due to severe endometriosis, causing more strain on the marriage. Later, however, the doctor confided in Sun that it was Jin who was infertile, and that he was afraid to tell him because of his job as an enforcer. Later, Sun learned of Jae Lee's death and attended his funeral. She asked her father if he would tell Jin about her affair, to which he declined, saying that it was not his place. During preparations for a business trip, with Jin, to Sydney and Los Angeles; Sun spoke privately with a woman acting as an interior decorator. Sun had planned to leave Jin and her family and the woman had helped Sun set up a false identity (and a place for her to hide until the search for her ended). She was given instructions to leave Jin at the Sydney airport at 11:15 precisely; a car would be waiting outside the Oceanic Airlines gate and she was to maintain a low profile. At the airport, Sun was prepared to follow her instructions, and heads towards the car outside. A single moment of tenderness from Jin, however, caused her to change her mind, and she decided to accompany him to Los Angeles. At the airport restaurant, she purchased food for the two of them. Sun accidentally spilled coffee on Jin and after he left to clean himself off; she listened to the snide remarks of a couple seated a few tables away. She and Jin then boarded the doomed flight. ===After the crash=== Season one Following the crash, Jin is overly protective of Sun and tells her that they must isolate themselves from the other survivors. Whenever other survivors, particularly Michael, attempt to communicate with her, Sun is frowned upon by Jin. One morning, Jin is handcuffed to the wreckage after attacking Michael, and Sun attempts to indicate the watch that Michael is wearing. Sayid misinterprets this as a plea to remove the cuffs. Sun approaches Michael in the jungle and, to his surprise, explains about the watch in English, asking him to keep her bilingualism a secret. Prior to moving into the caves with Jin, Sun attempts to bury her fake I.D. when she is caught by Michael; the two share a brief tender moment before Sun flees. Later, Sun helps move the fallen rocks after Jack is caught in a cave in, and is almost volunteered to crawl through the narrow tunnel to save him by Jin. When Shannon suffers a near- fatal asthma attack, Sun asks Michael to gather some eucalyptus plants, in order for her to make an herbal remedy for her. Her assistance is scorned by Jin. Sun creates a garden in the jungle, where she grows a variety of different herbs and fruit plants. She is helped by Kate, who then figures out that she speaks English. She begs Kate not to tell anyone else. Later, Sun attempts to bathe in the sea, but is quickly escorted away by Jin, prompting Michael to intervene. Sun slaps him for intervening, but apologizes to him later. Jin suspects something between the two and grows wary. That night, after the raft burns down, Sun discovers Jin in the caves with burn marks on his hands. She asks Jin if he caused the fire, to which he grows angry. When he is accused and beaten by Michael, Sun is forced to reveal her long-hidden bilingualism in front of Jin, and begs Michael to stop. Later, Jin leaves Sun, refusing to speak to her. When Boone is brought to the caves in critical condition, Sun helps Jack in the ensuing operation, retrieving a sea urchin in order for Jack to make a blood transfusion. Despite their efforts, Boone dies later that night. Sun expresses her worry to Kate about Jin leaving her. Following her advice, Sun poisons Jin's drinking water, but ends up poisoning Michael instead. Only Kate and Jack know about this. Moments before departing, Sun writes Jin a phrasebook, containing English words written in Korean phonetics. This leads Jin to apologise to Sun for his behaviour. Jin believes he is on the island because he is being punished. Jin tells Sun that he is leaving because he is going to rescue her. The two reconcile before Jin departs on the raft. Season two Sun is approached by Claire and Shannon, who give her the message bottle taken on the raft. In a bid to keep it a secret, Sun buries it on the beach. She notices later that she has lost her wedding ring, and frantically searches for it, even tearing up her garden. She later finds it buried with the bottle. A few days later, Sun and Jin are reunited as the tail-section survivors of the plane migrate on the beach. When the two learn of Michael's sudden departure to look for Walt, Sun refuses to allow Jin to help, reminding him that she is his wife. She later tells Jin that she doesn't like being undermined by him, and the two vow to prevent it from occurring in the future. One day, while working in her garden, Sun is bagged and tied from behind; Sun manages to escape, but does not see who attempted to kidnap her. Sun passes out, and reawakens at the camp, remembering little of the traumatic experience. Fearing for her safety, Jin disallows Sun to tend to her garden, going as far as ripping it apart. Sun returns to the beach, where she starts feeling light-headed. She asks Sawyer for a pregnancy test. Upon learning of her pregnancy, Sun is forced to tell Jin. She tells Jin that he is infertile, but swears that she has slept with no other; she had an affair with Jae Lee, but Jin never found out. Later, Sayid informs Sun of his plan to sail to the Others' camp using Desmond's boat, and asks her to ask Jin to sail for him. Sun does so, but demands that she come along too, knowing that Sayid will need someone to translate for him. As they sail to the Others' camp, they come across a statue of a four-toed foot. Sun and Jin remain on the boat while Sayid searches the Others' camp. Moments later, the three experience a deafening sound as the island is engulfed in a violet glow. Season three Sun is still on board the boat with Jin and Sayid, and eventually arrive at the pier. Sayid informs Sun of his plan to kidnap two of the Others, and asks her to lie to Jin. However, Jin reveals to Sun that he understands more English than she thinks. Sun hides in the boat that night while the other two wait outside. However, the Others head directly to the boat via sea, and Sun encounters Colleen. Startled by the boat's motor, Sun shoots Colleen, fatally injuring her. Sun manages to escape, narrowly avoiding Tom's gunfire. She makes it to shore, where she, Jin and Sayid return to the beach. Sun cares for Aaron one day while Claire goes for a swim, and is oblivious that she is drowning. Later, Sun attempts to help Jin speak English, by refusing to speak to him in Korean. Later, she and Jin help Claire in catching a bird. When Desmond thwarts their plans, Sun encourages Claire to investigate. The next day, Sun is involved in the investigation of the apparent deaths of Nikki and Paulo. At first, she suspects food poisoning, but later blames the Others, referencing the time she was almost kidnapped. She learns that it was merely a staged act, planned by Sawyer. She threatens that the next grave dug will be his if Jin finds out, and slaps him. She also returns the diamonds he gave her, branding them as worthless on the island. Since then, Sun refuses to speak directly to Sawyer. After Juliet migrates to the camp, Sun demands to know about pregnancy on the island, and is shocked to learn that women die during pregnancy. Juliet takes Sun to the Staff station, where she uses the medical equipment to determine a date of conception; Sun learns that she conceived on the island, making Jin the father, but leaving Sun with less than two months to live before her second trimester. Sun's trust in Juliet is broken when, during a camp meeting one night, Juliet's recorder is played, revealing a message informing Ben of Sun's pregnancy. She tells Jin that the baby is healthy, but never tells him about her fate. When Karl arrives to warn them of the Others' imminent arrival, Sun travels with the majority of the camp to the radio tower, while Jin stays behind. That night, she watches Jack's plan backfire, and grows concerned over the fate of her husband. Later, however, she and Rose are relieved to hear that their husbands are alive. She watches as Jack makes contact with Naomi's freighter. Season four Following Jack's success in contacting the freighter, Sun and Claire tend to Aaron shortly before heading back to the beach with the majority of the group. She is reunited with Jin at the crash site of the airplane cockpit. After learning of Charlie's death and Locke's plan to return to the barracks, Sun and Jin remain with Jack and return to the beach, awaiting apparent rescue. However Sun grows suspicious about the motives of their rescuers, and decides to leave with Jin. However, when Juliet finds out, in hopes of saving Sun's life, she reveals Sun's illness to Jin, and also tells him about her affair. Jin walks away from Sun, and Sun fears he is leaving her. Sun confronts Juliet, who reminds her that she has to get off the island in three weeks, or else she is dead. Jin later forgives Sun, and she decides she does not want to go with Locke. When Sayid returns to begin ferrying people back to the freighter, Juliet states Sun should be the first to go as she is pregnant and as Aaron is in her care. When they reach the boat, Sun is shocked to see Michael; their conversation is cut short when masses of C4 are found. Jin tells Sun to go back on deck where she looks on nervously. In the season finale, Sun manages to get on the helicopter piloted by Lapidus, where the rest of the Oceanic Six are already seated. Sun, however, refuses to leave Jin behind, who is still attempting to postpone the blast. Amid chaos, Sun is forced onto the helicopter, and as it becomes airborne, she sees Jin running on deck, waving his hands frantically. Sun pleads with Lapidus to land, but he refuses, since they are low on fuel. The freighter explodes via the strapped bomb monitor on Keamy, whom Ben kills. Sun screams in agony. Jack tells her Jin is gone, and Sun falls into an extended state of shock. The helicopter tries to land back on the Island, but Ben and Locke make it disappear. The six survivors of Oceanic 815, Lapidus, and Desmond take refuge on a raft, and soon they are spotted by Penelope Widmore's rescue ship. The Oceanic Six spend a week on the ship, before heading off to Sumba. After the Island Sun becomes one of the Oceanic Six, one of the six publicly known survivors of Flight 815. As part of the cover-up story, Sun reveals that Jin never made it off the plane after it crashed. Shortly after arriving home in Korea, Sun buys a majority share of her father's company with part of the Oceanic settlement that she received, and tells him that she holds him as one of two people responsible for Jin's death (the second person being Ben, as revealed in Season 5.) Several months later, Sun goes into labor and gives birth to a healthy baby girl. She names her daughter Ji Yeon, due to Jin's request on the island. She is later visited by Hurley, and the two visit Jin's grave, where Sun says that she misses him and was calling for him during labor, knowing that he wasn't there. A few years later, Sun travels to London to meet with Charles Widmore. She tells him that she knows he is looking for the island, and that the Oceanic Six are lying. She gives Widmore her business card and tells him to contact her when he is ready to work with her before walking away. ===Season five=== Sun traveled to Los Angeles from Korea when she is detained by Charles Widmore. He questions her motives for approaching him so disrespectfully, before asking what it is she thinks they have in common. Sun informs him that their only shared interest is in killing Benjamin Linus. While in Los Angeles, Sun contacts Kate, and lets her know she doesn't blame her for not finding Jin before boarding the helicopter; Kate did the right thing, and now she must do so again by protecting Aaron at all costs. Later on, Kate decides to track down the lawyer in charge of a case against her and asks Sun to look after Aaron, while looking after him she receives a package which contains chocolates and a gun. At the end of the episode, Sun is told by Kate to meet up with her and follows them to a marina where she watches from her car the group discussing Hurley and Aaron before picking up the gun and leaving the car. Sun threatens to kill Ben, until she learns that Jin may still be alive. Upon confronting Ben, Sun learned that Jin was in fact alive on the island, to prove he was telling the truth he presented Sun with Jin's wedding ring which he had given to Locke to convince Sun he was dead so she would not return and be in danger. Going with Ben and Jack to a location in L.A where they would learn how to get back to the island, Sun met the mysterious Ms. Hawking who described how a giant \\"island tracker\\" machine had found that, to get back to the island, they needed to pass over a specific area in between L.A and Guam. Boarding the flight with Jack, Kate, Hurley, Sayid and Ben, Sun was involved in a bright light which apparently transported some of the passengers to the island. Return to the Island Sun, however, landed, in the year 2007, on Hydra Island near the main Island along with the majority of the 316 passengers (including Ben, Lapidus, and Locke). When Ben moves into the jungle in attempt to return to the main Island, she follows him and is in turn followed by Lapidus. Sun knocks Ben out with a paddle when they reach a pair of canoes and she and Lapidus then continue to the Island. They find the Barracks empty, save for Christian. When Sun asks where Jin is, Christian informs her that he is on the Island, but in the year 1977. After meeting the supposedly resurrected John Locke, she follows him to the Others' camp. The man posing as Locke tells her that if there is a way to reunite her with her husband, he will find it. When Sun is not present, however, the fake Locke tells Ben that he has no interest in reuniting Sun and Jin. When the Others pass through the old beach camp, Sun finds Charlie's ring inside Aaron's old cradle. She is later present at the Statue remnants when Other Ilana arrives with her people and proves the resurrected Locke to be an impostor by revealing the body of the real John Locke. ===Season six=== After the fake Locke, revealed to be the Island's Smoke Monster and more formally the Man in Black, kidnaps Richard and the Others gathered at the Statue depart for the Temple, Sun requests that those still at the statue (herself, Ilana, Ben and Frank) bury Locke. They take his body to the graveyard of 815 survivors near the beach and bury it. After this, the four head to the Temple, where they arrive in the middle of the Smoke Monster's massacre of the Others who remain there, and meet up with Miles. They escape through a passageway and head for the beach. At the beach, Hurley, Jack, and Richard arrive shortly after. As they all decide what to do next, Sun grows impatient, and retreats to her garden for alone time. However, the Man in Black appears to her and insists that she follow him, since he has Jin. Sun runs off, however, she bumps her head on a low branch and falls unconscious. Upon awakening, she realizes she can no longer speak English; Jack assures her it is because of temporary aphasia. They all decide to destroy the Ajira Airways plane to prevent the Man in Black from escaping, but after a series of disagreements between Richard and Hurley, the group split; Ben, Miles, and Richard will search for more explosives, while the rest will go talk with the Man in Black. Jack, Hurley, Sun, and Lapidus then run off to join Sawyer and Kate at the docks, hoping to abandon the Man in Black and seek refuge at Hydra Island with Charles Widmore's people. Claire later joins them, but Jack leaves because he wants to stay on the Island, per Jacob's request. Upon arriving there, Sun sees Jin and finally reunites, breaking her aphasia. However, Widmore's people throw them into cages, Widmore claiming this is for their own good. That night, the Man in Black, as the Smoke Monster, attack the base, and Jack frees them. Meeting with Sayid, they make their way to the Ajira flight, but the Man in Black claims that if they are to escape the Island, they should take Widmore's submarine. At the dock, however, Widmore's men engage in a gunfight with them, forcing the submarine to leave Claire and the Man in Black behind. Inside the sub, Jack discovers C-4 in his pack, realizing the Man in Black set them up. While Sawyer wants to disable it, Jack assures that it will be alright, since the Man in Black cannot kill them unless they tamper with the bomb themselves. Sawyer does so, not trusting Jack, but increases the timer. Sayid runs off with the bomb in a suicidal move, trying to save some of the others; it detonates, flooding the sub. Sun is pinned to the wall by fragments, and Jin desperately tries to free her. As the submarine slowly floods, Sun begs Jin to leave her, but he insists on staying, telling her in Korean that they will never be apart again. They share one final passionate kiss and embrace before they drown, holding hands. Shortly after she died, Jack, Kate and Hurley all cried over her and Jin's deaths. ==Development== Originally Yunjin Kim auditioned for the role of Kate. At her audition she explained she spoke fluent Korean, having been raised in South Korea, where she had starred in several movies. The producers liked her so much that they created Sun just for her. The character was planned to be someone who could not speak English, but after examining her relationship with her husband, the audience would learn that she does in fact speak it.\\"Before They Were Lost\\".

Although often influential within the indigenous culture, its members do not usually function as a modern nation's primary law-making body (cf. British House of Lords), being neither representative (i.e. democratically elected) nor consisting of members appointed individually by the government in power, whether democratic or not. It consists of all or some of the \\"traditional leaders\\", historically known in English as chiefs, of a country or a sub-division thereof. A House of Chiefs is not, constitutionally, a partisan institution within the body politic. Members of a House of Chiefs are selected neither by a universal suffrage process of those they represent nor by the state executive or legislature they advise: Their function is to express a cultural, historical and/or ethnic point of view on public policies. The process by which individuals qualify for membership varies, but is based on tradition specific to his or her (e.g. the Rain Queen) historic community or ethnic group. Sometimes the qualifying position is obtained through heredity within a local dynasty, sometimes through selection by consensus of a ritually or socially prominent subset of a community, and sometimes by a combination thereof. Historically, chiefs were the last indigenous rulers before colonisation of a people, and their modern versions often continue to play a local cultural role of varying significance. Especially in colonial times, chiefs were often used as instruments of indirect rule, and/or convenient alternatives to elective institutions. == Examples == In the post-colonial age, various Houses of Chiefs and similar assemblies have existed in various nations: ===Africa=== *In Botswana, the Ntlo ya Dikgosi, formerly known as the House of Chiefs. *In Ghana, the National House of Chiefs, representing the various regional Houses of Chiefs. *In Nigeria, there were several Houses of Chiefs in the Nigerian First Republic. In the modern era, the various states of the Federation each have a State Council of Traditional Rulers and Chiefs. ** Also formerly, in the previously German, British and then Nigerian Southern Cameroons. *In Somaliland, the House of Elders' membership consists of the various sultans of Somaliland. *In South Africa, the colonial House of Chiefs fell into disuse, but, post-apartheid, indigenously-organised versions have been revived, first within the ruling ANC party, then in KwaZulu Natal. The National House of Traditional Leaders officially advises the presidency today and is composed of 23 members, while the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa currently functions as a more inclusive, non-governmental version. *In Zambia, according to the 1996 constitution. *In Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe Council of Chiefs. ===Pacific=== *In Fiji, the House of Chiefs ‚Äì not to be confused with the Great Council of Chiefs (Bose Levu Vakaturaga). *In the former Kingdom of Hawaii, the Hale o na Alii o Hawaii. *In the Marshall Islands. *In the Republic of Palau. *In the Solomon Islands, the Gela Vaukolu. *In Vanuatu. ===Other places=== The term has also been used for similar pre- and post- colonial assemblies of tribal leaders, such as among certain Native American tribes. == Alternatives == Another way to include traditional chiefs in a nation's political life is to assign them a number of seats in a wider assembly. In Zimbabwe, for example, ten chiefs are chosen to be members of the Senate, the upper house of the country's parliament. From 1990 to 2005, they were represented in the House of Assembly (now the lower house) when it was the sole legislative chamber. == References == Category:Legislatures ","title":"House of Chiefs"},{"id":"2231034","text":"This is a list of the wild birds found in Western Australia. The list includes introduced species, common vagrants, recently extinct species, extirpated species, some very rare vagrants (seen once) and species only present in captivity. 627 species are listed. The taxonomy is based on Christidis and Boles, 2008. Their system has been developed over nearly two decades and has strong local support, but deviates in important ways from more generally accepted schemes. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 2019 edition. All of the birds below are included in the total bird count for Western Australia. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Western Australia * (E) Endemic - a species endemic to Western Australia * (I) Introduced - a species introduced to Western Australia as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions * (Ex) Extirpated - a species that no longer occurs in Western Australia although populations exist elsewhere * (X) Extinct - a species or subspecies that no longer exists. ==Ostriches== Order: StruthioniformesFamily: Struthionidae This order is not native to Western Australia, but feral populations of one species have become established. { style=\\"width:60%;\\"  - !width=35%  Common name !width=33%  Binomial !width=32%  Notes -  Common ostrich  Struthio camelus  (I) } ==Cassowaries and emu== Order: CasuariiformesFamily: Dromaiidae This family of flightless ratite birds is represented by two living species in Australia.

1936) was a lawyer, educator, and pioneer in the field of women's rights to legal education. She was the daughter of Platt Rogers Spencer, a reformer and promoter of the Spencerian Method, the widely used form of handwriting. ==Biography== Mussey was born on May 13, 1850, in Geneva, Ohio, United States. Between the age of 12 and the time of her father's death, when she was age 14, she was an assistant at his penmanship school. Thereafter she took up residence with relatives and attended Rice's Young Ladies' Seminary in Poughkeepsie, New York, Lake Erie College in Painesville, Ohio, and Rockford College in Rockford, Illinois. In 1871 she married Reuben D. Mussey, a former Union Army colonel, who was nominated but not confirmed to the grade of brevet brigadier general; he was also a successful lawyer. Having been denied admission at the law schools of National University and Columbian College (now George Washington University), Ellen Mussey tutored herself in the field of law and underwent legal training in her husband's law office and began to practice law. Reuben Mussey died May 29, 1892, which might have ended Ellen Mussey's law practice carried out under her husband's name. She obtained special consideration and was allowed to qualify for the bar by oral examination, which she passed in March, 1893. In 1896, Ellen Spencer Mussey was admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States. ==Career== She was approached in 1895 by Delia Sheldon Jackson, an aspiring attorney, to apprentice her as a student of law. Realizing both the scope of the task and the significance of the opportunity, Mussey sought out the assistance of a colleague and friend, Emma Gillett. The two opened the first session of the Woman's Law Class on February 1, 1896. The class had an enrollment of three: Jackson and two other women, Nanette Paul and Helen Malcolm. Within a few years, the program had expanded and several prominent Washington, DC attorneys were brought in for assistance. Although Mussey and Gillett had not initially aspired to establish an independent law school, when Columbian College refused their request to take on the women they had educated for their final year of education‚Äî-on grounds that \\"women did not have the mentality for law\\"‚Äîthey decided to establish a co-educational law school specifically open to women. Thus, in April 1898, the Washington College of Law (now merged with American University) was incorporated in Washington, DC, as the first law school in the world founded by women. Mussey served as the first dean of the college as serving until her retirement in 1913. With Emma Gillett, Mussey founded the Women's Bar Association of the District of Columbia on May 19, 1917, and was elected its first President. The WBA was one of the first organizations for women lawyers in United States. In 1919, Mussey also helped to found the National Association of Women Lawyers. Mussey also served as the first chairwoman of the Women's City Club of Washington, D.C., which was founded in the same year. Mussey died on April 21, 1936, in Washington, D.C. ==FootnotesReferencesBibliography== *Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands.

Born in St. John's, Carnell received his early education at Bishop Feild College and the Methodist College before going into his father's business as an undertaker. He married Mabel Payne in 1904. They would have two sons and four daughters. His son Geoffrey later served in the Newfoundland assembly. After several failed attempts in colonial politics, he decided to enter municipal politics. In the municipal elections of 1929 for St. John's, he was elected deputy mayor. After the sitting mayor, Charles Howlett, died in 1932, Carnell became acting mayor until he was elected to the post officially by acclamation the following year. He would be reelected to the position continuously until 1949. Carnell's term spanned the time under which Newfoundland was a Crown colony of the United Kingdom after the Dominion government had gone bankrupt and collapsed. To many Newfoundlanders, the mayor was the voice of the people as the highest-ranking official on the island that had been elected. To the colonial government, however, the city council was an inefficient nuisance. Nevertheless, Carnell was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1939. Throughout his term, Carnell's administration would continue to provide relatively stable and solvent government to St. John's, leading the way in debt relief, improving the standard and affordability of housing in the city and beginning construction on Memorial Stadium, which would be finished in 1955. The 'LaGuardia of St. John's' would be defeated by his deputy mayor, Harry Mews, in the 1949 election. ==References== Category:1877 births Category:1951 deaths Category:Mayors of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador Category:Bishop Feild School alumni Category:Canadian Commanders of the Order of the British Empire ","title":"Andrew Carnell"},{"id":"2231057","text":"Eyebeam may refer to: * Eye beam, an emission theory of sight * Eyebeam (comic), a daily comic strip written and illustrated by Sam Hurt * eyeBeam (software), a VoIP softphone developed by CounterPath Corporation * Eyebeam (organization), a not-for-profit arts and technology center based in New York City * I-beam, a beam with an I- or H-shaped cross-section ","title":"Eyebeam"},{"id":"2231066","text":"Little Fighter Online (LFO, Chinese: Â∞èÊúãÂèãÈΩäÊâì‰∫§ Online) was a fighting game for Windows.

He was a principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre (ABT) from 1997 till July 2012. He was the artistic director of the Royal New Zealand Ballet from 2011 to 2014. His wife is Gillian Murphy, also a principal dancer with ABT. ==Early life and training== Born in Tyrone, Pennsylvania, he is the only son of a Lutheran minister who became a prison warden in New York; their last name is pronounced \\"Shtee-fell\\" and is German for \\"boot.\\" Stiefel began ballet training in Madison, Wisconsin at the Monona Academy of Dance at age eight. He became involved with classical dance through his older sister, who was taking a class. Before that, both he and his sister took gymnastics classes. His first ballet teacher, Jo Jean Retrum, was interested in getting Ethan to take class because boys in ballet are a rarity. He studied for two years at the Milwaukee Ballet School under Ted Kivitt and Paul Sutherland, and at the Central Pennsylvania Youth Ballet before moving to New York City to attend the School of American Ballet on scholarship. While there, Stanley Williams enrolled him in the company's men's special class where he trained alongside Rudolf Nureyev, Mikhail Baryshnikov and Fernando Bujones. He studied with Baryshnikov himself at the short-lived Mikhail Baryshnikov's School of Classical Ballet. ==CareerDancing=== He started his dancing career in 1989, when he joined the corps de ballet of New York City Ballet at age 16. In 1992, he took a leave of absence to perform with the Z√ºrich Ballet, under directorship of Bernd R. Bienert, but returned to NYCB a year later as a soloist. By 1995, he was a principal dancer with the company. He ended his tenure with NYCB in April 1997 when he joined ABT as a principal dancer, from which he retired in 2012. He danced with the short-lived Mikhail Baryshnikov School of Classical Ballet at ABT. His dance repertoire includes many key romantic roles in both classical and contemporary ballet. He won a silver medal at the Prix de Lausanne in 1989 and also received a Princess Grace Foundation-USA grant in 1991. In 1998, Stiefel was nominated for the Benois de la Danse award as one of the rising stars in ballet. In 2007, Stiefel made his debut with the Australian Ballet in Nureyev's staging of Don Quixote, for its Melbourne and Sydney seasons, in the role of Basilio. In 2008, Stiefel was a recipient of the Dance Magazine Award along with Pina Bausch, Sylvia Walters, and Lawrence Rhodes for his role as a leader in the dance field. Stiefel has appeared as a guest artist with many companies throughout his career including the Mariinsky Ballet, the Royal Ballet, the Australian Ballet, Zurich Ballet, Munich Ballet, Hamburg Ballet, National Ballet of Canada, New National Ballet in Tokyo, and Teatro Col√≥n Ballet in Buenos Aires. He gave his final performance as an ABT principal dancer on July 7, 2012, at the Metropolitan Opera House, as Ali the slave in Le Corsaire.http://www.abt.org/insideabt/news_display.asp?News_ID=384 He is widely considered right now to be currently \\"the greatest male ballet dancer in the world or \\"the most advanced male ballet dancer in the world\\". ===Directing and teaching=== In 2004, he created a four-week workshop, Stiefel & Students, for aspiring dancers where dance students train and perform with professional ballet dancers. It is held annually on Martha's Vineyard in the month of August. The program accepts students aged 12 to 18. Its rollcall of star guest teachers include Stiefel, Johan Kobborg, Amanda McKerrow, Elizabeth Parkinson, Scott Wise, Marcelo Gomes, John Gardner, Gary Chryst, Ann Reinking, and Alina Cojocaru. The program has been on hiatus since 2008. In late 2005, Ballet Pacifica, based in Irvine, California, named him as its artistic director with the aim to relaunch itself as a higher-profile ballet company. However, after the company failed to raise the funds necessary to support their new vision, its executive director resigned followed by Stiefel himself in April 2006. He was formerly the dean of the School of Dance at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem where he also choreographed a new production of The Nutcracker. In November 2010 Stiefel was announced as the next director of the Royal New Zealand Ballet. He took up that position in September 2011.Royal New Zealand Ballet website Stiefel expanded the international profile of the company, programmed new works, created a one-act ballet Bierhalle, and choreographed a production of Giselle. In March 2014, Stiefel announced that he would not extend his contract with the Royal New Zealand Ballet and would return to the United States. ===Television and film appearances=== In 2000, he starred in the film Center Stage, directed by Nicholas Hytner with original choreography by Susan Stroman and featuring Amanda Schull. He also starred in the sequels Center Stage: Turn It Up and Center Stage: On Pointe. Center Stage features a subplot in which Stiefel's character garners the financial support of a flirtatious female philanthropist (played by Elizabeth Hubbard). An article in The New York Times titled \\"How Much Is That Dancer in the Program?\\" revealed that Stiefel has a similar real-life sponsorship relationship with wealthy philanthropist Anka Palitz. In 2007 he appeared in the film Born to Be Wild - The Leading Men of American Ballet Theatre with Angel Corella, Jose Manuel Carreno and Vladimir Malakhov directed by Judy Kinberg and produced by Jodee Nimerichter. In 2007, Stiefel appeared in an episode of Queer Eye to meet a \\"straight guy\\" who considers Stiefel his \\"idol.\\" In 2010 he appeared as himself in season 4, episode 8 of Gossip Girl with Murphy. ==Personal life== He is an avid motorcyclist. He grew up riding dirt bikes, currently owns a Harley-Davidson Wide Glide and once drove 3,500 miles across the north-eastern US with his then-girlfriend Gillian Murphy riding pillion. He is also a Green Bay Packers and Wisconsin Badgers fan. Stiefel proposed to Murphy, a principal dancer with American Ballet Company, in May 2011, after they performed in ABT's spring gala. They were married on September 19 2015. On December 14, 2018, Murphy announced that she was pregnant with her first child and would take maternity leave for the 2018‚Äì2019 season. In June 2019, Murphy announced the birth of their son. ==Quotes== *\\"American ballet, for me, is Stanley Williams.\\" *\\"Baryshnikov was and is my idol. He's the man.

As of 2016, seven people have been removed from the Order of Canada: Alan Eagleson, David Ahenakew, T. Sher Singh, Steve Fonyo, Garth Drabinsky, Conrad Black, and Ranjit Chandra. Eagleson was removed from the order after being jailed for fraud in 1998; Ahenakew was removed in 2005, after being convicted of promoting anti-Semitic hatred in 2002; Singh was removed after the revocation of his law licence for professional misconduct; Fonyo was removed due to numerous criminal convictions; Drabinsky was removed in 2012 after being found guilty of fraud and forgery in Ontario; and Chandra was removed in 2015 for committing research fraud. The formal removal process is performed by the Advisory Council of the Order of Canada, though it can be initiated by any citizen of Canada. ==Policy== Paragraph 25, section C, of the Constitution of the Order of Canada allows the Governor General of Canada to remove a person from the order by issuing an ordinance based on a decision of the Advisory Council of the Order of Canada. This decision is based on \\"evidence and guided by the principle of fairness and shall only be made after the Council has ascertained the relevant facts relating to the case under conlideration.\\" A member of the order can be removed for being convicted of a criminal offense, or if the conduct of the person deviates significantly from recognized standards and is seen as undermining the credibility, integrity, or relevance of the order. A member of the order can be removed if they have been subjected to an official sanction by an adjudicating body, professional association, or other organization. Official sanctions can include fines, reprimands, or disbarment (as was the case for Alan Eagleson and T. Sher Singh). However, the only punishment the advisory council can issue is removal from the Order of Canada. ==Procedure== The removal process begins by sending a written petition to the deputy secretary of the chancellery or by the deputy secretary initiating the process himself/herself. If the petition was started by a citizen, the claim could be judged as valid or invalid. If it is invalid, the deputy secretary will consult with the secretary general of the order and a letter will be sent to petitioner explaining their decision. If it is valid, the petition will be sent by the secretary general to the advisory council. The advisory council now has the decision to either continue or to stop the removal process. If it stops, the secretary general will notify the petitioner. If the council sees reasonable grounds for the process to continue, the removal-nominee will go through the remainder of the removal process. The secretary general will send a registered letter to the removal- nominee that allegations were filed against them and their status in the Order of Canada is under consideration by the advisory council. The letter also gives the removal-nominee the options of responding to the allegations or to resign from the order. If the removal-nominee decides to leave the order on their own, they will notify the secretary general of their decision. If the removal-nominee decides to challenge the allegations, either they or their authorized representative will respond to the allegations within the time limit set in the notification letter. Whatever action the removal-nominee takes, the process will be handed back to the advisory council for further consideration. Once the advisory council has made their decision, they will send a report to the governor general explaining their findings and their recommendations. The governor general, following the recommendation of the advisory council, will either notify the person that they will remain in the order in good standing or issue an ordinance terminating a person's membership in the order. Once the ordinance has been published, the person must return all Order insignia to the secretary general of the order and their name will be removed from all records held by the chancellery. The former member also loses the right to use their post-nominal letters in their names and loses the use of the order motto, ribbon, and medal on their personal coat of arms. When the Order of Newfoundland and Labrador was created in 2001, it included a removal system modelled after that one used by the Order of Canada. ==Involuntary removal from the order== At the time of Ranjit Chandra's removal from the Order of Canada in 2015, there have been six other invididuals who were removed from the order. ===Alan Eagleson=== Alan Eagleson was appointed to the rank of Officer of the Order of Canada April 20, 1989, for his work in promoting the sport of ice hockey. While serving as the head of the National Hockey League Players Association, he was accused of defrauding players out of money. Other charges included racketeering, embezzlement, and obstruction of justice with 34 total charges in the United States and 8 in Canada. In January 1998, Eagleson pleaded guilty to three counts of mail fraud in the US. In that same month, Eagleson was disbarred in Canada. In February, the Governor General at the time, Rom√©o LeBlanc, signed an ordinance that removed Eagleson from the order. Eagleson became the first person to be removed from the order. The decision to terminate Eagleson's membership in the order was gazetted on March 14, 1998. During his sentencing in July 1998, Eagleson wore his Order of Canada lapel pin, despite the fact it was already stripped from him by that time. However, when asked to return the order, Eagleson did so within a week of the demand being made. ===David Ahenakew=== David Ahenakew was appointed to the grade of Member in December 1978 for his longtime \\"service to Indians and M√©tis in Saskatchewan culminated in his election as Chief of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indians, which has revolutionized Indian education in his province.\\" Ahenakew first came under fire in 2002 after giving a profanity- laden speech. In this speech, Ahenakew called Jewish people \\"a disease\\". Ahenakew made taped comments to the Saskatoon StarPhoenix a few days after the speech that included \\"That's how Hitler came in. That he was going to make damn sure that Jews weren't going to take over\\", and \\"That's why he fried six million of those guys.\\" In June 2003, Ahenakew was formally charged by the Saskatchewan justice department with willingly promoting hatred., but his removal from the order was put on hold until the legal dispute was finished. On June 29, 2005, the order's Advisory Council began its formal revocation process, during a regularly scheduled semi-annual meeting. Ahenakew was informed, in writing, that he can either voluntarily resign, respond, or contest the possibility of revocation. Ultimately, the council found that irrespective of the outcome of Ahenakew's legal proceedings, it brought disrepute to the order, and Governor General Adrienne Clarkson to issue an ordinance on July 11 to officially remove Ahenakew from the Order of Canada. The decision to terminate Ahenakew's membership in the order was gazetted on July 30, 2005. ===T. Sher Singh=== T. Sher Singh received his Member of the Order of Canada in 2002, due to a record in public service. His appointment was terminated on December 10, 2008, after the Law Society of Upper Canada found him guilty of professional misconduct and revoked his licence to practise law. Among the allegations against Singh were that he failed to serve clients, mishandled trust funds, misappropriated $2,000 from a client, and continued to practise after being suspended in November 2005. His membership in the order was revoked on December 10, 2008. ===Steve Fonyo=== Steve Fonyo was the youngest person ever appointed as an Officer of the order in 1985. Following his appointment, however, Fonyo developed an addiction to cocaine. The advisory council considered removing him in 1995, following a criminal conviction related to his cocaine use, but did not move to strip him from the order. By 1996, Fonyo had a number of run-ins with the law. He was accused of a number of offenses, including assault with a weapon, aggravated assault, fraud for writing bad checks to supermarkets, and domestic violence. Fonyo was terminated from the order on December 10, 2009. The decision to terminate Fonyo's membership in the Order was gazetted on January 23, 2010, and announced by the Governor General's office two days later. ===Garth Drabinsky=== Garth Drabinsky was a theatrical production mogul in Canada, responsible for numerous successful productions, most notably the long-running Toronto production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera. He was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1995. In 2009, he was found guilty of fraud and forgery in Ontario and has been a fugitive from American law for related crimes. With the Supreme Court of Canada's ruling on March 29, 2012, not to hear his appeal or grant a new trial, Drabinsky has apparently exhausted his opportunities to have his convictions overturned and is serving the balance of his reduced sentence. On November 29, 2012, the Governor General signed an ordinance removing Drabinsky from the order. Drabinsky subsequently filed an application in the Federal Court of Canada to block his removal. ===Conrad Black=== Media baron Conrad Black was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1990. In 2001, following a conflict where then Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien invoked the Nickle Resolution to prevent Black from being appointed a life peer, Black surrendered his Canadian citizenship, though he remained in the Order of Canada. In 2005, Black was arrested in the United States on multiple charges of mail and wire fraud. However, due to lengthy appeals, even as Black was serving a prison sentence, he still remained a member of the Order of Canada. In September 2011, after Black returned to prison due to the failure of his appeal, Rideau Hall confirmed that Black's appointment was under review by the Advisory Council of the Order of Canada, which has the power to recommend \\"the termination of a person's appointment to the Order of Canada if the person has been convicted of a criminal offence.\\" Black's requests for an oral hearing were denied by the advisory council and his application to federal court for an oral hearing to be required was dismissed. Black appealed the decision. In an interview, Black intimated that he would rather resign from the order than be removed. \\"I would not wait for giving these junior officials the evidently almost aphrodisiacal pleasure of throwing me out. I would withdraw,\\" he told CBC's Susan Ormiston. \\"In fact, I wouldn't be interested in serving.\\" On January 31, 2014, the Governor General at the time, David Johnston, announced that he had accepted a recommendation from an advisory council to remove Black from the Order of Canada. On the same day, the Governor General, acting on the recommendation of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, also expelled Black from the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, to which he had been appointed in 1992. Black, however, maintained he resigned from the order the year prior. The decision to terminate Black's membership from the order was gazetted on February 22, 2014. In 2019 Conrad Black's American criminal record was pardoned by President Donald Trump ===Ranjit Chandra=== Ranjit Chandra was a research scientist and professor at Memorial University of Newfoundland, and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1989. In 2006, CBC aired The Secret Life of Dr. Chandra., which alleged that research published by Chandra was fraudulent. In 2015, a jury trial in which Chandra sued the CBC for libel found the contents of the documentary to be truthful. In that same year, the British Medical Journal retracted one of his papers, \\"Influence of maternal diet during lactation and use of formula feeds on development of atopic eczema in high risk infants\\", which was published in 1989, due to what was described as \\"scientific misconduct\\". Rideau Hall revoked Chandra's appointment to the order on December 3, 2015, but the decision was only gazetted on January 9, 2016. ==Resignation== Astronomer Ren√© Racine resigned as a member of the Order in 2009. In this photo he is wearing the order's lapel pin. Resignations from the order can take place only through the prescribed channels, which include the member submitting to the Secretary General of the Order of Canada a letter notifying the chancellery of his or her desire to terminate their membership, and only with the governor general's approval can the resignation take effect. If a member resigns, he or she must return all insignia and lose the use of the order motto, ribbon, and badge on their personal coat of arms. ===Notable cases=== Related to Henry Morgentaler In reaction to the decision to induct Henry Morgentaler into the order, a number of members in the order indicated they would return or had returned their emblems in protest, including Lucien Larr√© and former Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick Gilbert Finn. Larr√©'s resignation was gazetted on May 30, 2009, having been approved on February 25, 2010. As for Finn, he has never officially resigned for the order, as no news of his resignation has ever been gazetted. On June 1, 2009, the Governor General at the time, Micha√´lle Jean, announced that she has accepted the resignations of astronomer and inventor Ren√© Racine, pianist Jacqueline Richard, and Cardinal Jean-Claude Turcotte. The resignations were directly attributed by media reports to the decision to induct Morgentaler. The three's resignations were gazetted on May 30, 2009, having been approved on December 9, 2008. On April 19, 2010, the resignation of Frank Chauvin, a retired fire-fighter who opened an orphanage in Haiti, was accepted. Chauvin's decision to resign from the order was also directly attributed by media reports to the decision to induct Morgentaler. Chauvin's resignation was gazetted on May 30, 2009, having been approved on February 25, 2010. Other cases In January 2013, the Governor General at the time, David Johnston, accepted the resignation of historian Camille Limoges. Limoges was named to the order in 2010, and reportedly resigned from all his honors out of a desire to live a simpler life. At times, people resign from the order following a significant personal scandal. In July 2013, Bernard Norman Barwin's resignation from the order was approved by the Governor General, and gazetted a month later. Months prior, Barwin was reprimanded for inseminating women with the wrong sperm. It was later proven via DNA testing that Barwin had in fact inseminated numerous patient's with his own sperm rather than that of the intended father or approved sperm donor without authorization of the fertility patient. In May 2014, Louis LaPierre left the order, after it was revealed that he misrepresented his academic credentials. Despite media reports that LaPierre was stripped of the order, and suggestions by at least one member of the order that LaPierre be stripped of the honour, the text used in the Canada Gazette notice on his leaving of the order, published in June 2014, were similar to those used in other resignations, and clearly states that the individual requested the removal. ===Death=== The Constitution for the Order of Canada also allows for membership in the order to end when a member dies. When a member dies, the post-nominal letters may still be affixed to their name and their family may keep the insignia as family heirlooms. Organizations such as the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate and Madonna House Apostolate have, on at least one occasion, returned Order of Canada insignias of deceased former members. However, since membership terminates with the death of the member, the return of the insignia has no effect on the composition of the order. ==Change in status== The first person \\"removed\\" from the order was considered by historian Christopher McCreery as more of a transfer of status than a removal. In 1981, Zena Sheardown was appointed an honorary member of the Order of Canada. She was the wife of John Sheardown, a staff member at the Canadian embassy in Tehran during the Iranian Revolution. At this time, the new regime did not recognize international laws regarding diplomatic immunity and allowed a group of students to take control of the US embassy and hold its staff members hostage. Several staff were not on site at this time and found refuge with the Canadian diplomatic contingent, the now famous Canadian Caper. At great personal risk, the Sheardowns personally housed four Americans in their home for months until they could be safely removed from the country. At this point, although married to a Canadian, Zena was awarded an honorary Order of Canada in 1981, due to her being a British subject via her Guyanese citizenship. By 1986, Sheardown had become a naturalized Canadian, and Sheardown's honorary appointment was terminated, in exchange for an appointment as a full member. ==ReferencesBibliography== * == External links == * The Constitution of the Order of Canada ‚Äì includes policy and procedure for termination of appointment to the Order of Canada Category:Order of Canada ","title":"Removal from the Order of Canada"},{"id":"2231105","text":"Bridger‚ÄìTeton National Forest is located in western Wyoming, United States. The forest consists of , making it the third largest National Forest outside Alaska. The forest stretches from Yellowstone National Park, along the eastern boundary of Grand Teton National Park and from there rides along the western slope of the Continental Divide to the southern end of the Wind River Range. The forest also extends southward encompassing the Salt River Range and Wyoming Range mountains near the Idaho border. ==Geography== Located within the forest are the Gros Ventre, Bridger and Teton Wildernesses, totaling . Other points of interest contained in the forest include Gannett Peak (13,804 ft/4,207 m), the tallest mountain in Wyoming, and the Gros Ventre landslide, which is one of the largest readily visible landslides on earth. All of the forest is in turn a part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Sleeping Indian Peak Bridger‚ÄìTeton National Forest While Gannett Peak is the highest summit in the forest, another 40 named mountains rise above . The high altitudes and abundant snowfall, exceeding 600 inches (50 ft/15 m) at some locations, provides a constant supply of water for streams and rivers. 1,500 lakes also help provide water for the Yellowstone, Snake and Green rivers, which all have their headwaters in the forest. Seven of the largest glaciers outside of Alaska are located within the forest boundaries. U.S. Route 26 and U.S. Route 287 cross over the continental divide at Togwotee Pass and enter the forest from the north, and U.S. Highways 89 and 191 provide access to the forest in the vicinity of Jackson, Wyoming and forest lands to the south. ==Ecology== The primary tree species include lodgepole pine, Engelmann spruce, Douglas- fir, subalpine fir, aspen and whitebark pine. Willows, grasses and sagebrush are found on the lower altitudes, while above the timberline alpine meadows are common. Threatened and endangered species found within the forest boundaries include grizzly bears, wolf, black-footed ferret and peregrine falcon. Most of the mammals that existed in the region prior to European settlement can still be found here. Elk, moose, mule deer, bighorn sheep, bison, coyote, marmot, pronghorn, and cougar are but a few of the 75 species of mammals known to exist in the forest. Four subspecies of cutthroat trout also are found here including the Snake River cutthroat trout. 355 species of birds have been sighted including bald eagles, trumpeter swans, sandhill cranes, hawks, and Clark's nutcrackers. ==Recreation== Bridger‚ÄìTeton National Forest headquarters in Jackson, Wyoming Over of hiking trails are located in the forest providing access into wilderness areas and interlinking with trails in Yellowstone National Park. There are several dozen vehicle accessible campgrounds that have picnic tables and tent sites as well as room in some circumstances for recreational vehicles. Nighttime temperatures can be below freezing any time of the year and mosquitos in the late spring and early summer are common. Summertime high temperatures average in the 70s and the wintertime lows can drop below -50 degrees. ==Administration== Bridger‚ÄìTeton National Forest is an administrative combination of Bridger and Teton National Forests, amalgamated in 1973. The Bridger National Forest itself absorbed Wyoming National Forest in 1923. The Wyoming National Forest had been created as the Yellowstone Forest Reserve in 1904, then renamed in 1908. The Teton Forest Reserve was created at the same time, destined to become Teton National Forest. Ranger district offices are located in Pinedale, Kemmerer, Big Piney, Moran, Afton and Jackson. The forest headquarters is located in Jackson. In descending order of land area the forest is located in parts of Sublette, Teton, Lincoln, Park, and Fremont counties. ==Gallery== File:Bridgerteton map.jpgBridger‚ÄìTeton National Forest Map File:Cook Lake Bridger Wilderness.jpgCook Lake File:Middlepineylake.jpgMiddle Piney Lake File:TitcombLakesWY.jpgTitcomb Lakes File:Slide Lake Bridger Wilderness.jpgSlide Lake ==See also== * Granite Hot Springs * Green River * Wilderness areas: ** Bridger Wilderness ** Gros Ventre Wilderness ** Teton Wilderness ==References * Category:National Forests of Wyoming Category:National Forests of the Rocky Mountains Category:Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem Category:Protected areas of Teton County, Wyoming Category:Protected areas of Sublette County, Wyoming Category:Protected areas of Lincoln County, Wyoming Category:Protected areas of Park County, Wyoming Category:Protected areas of Fremont County, Wyoming Category:Protected areas established in 1908 Category:1908 establishments in Wyoming ","title":"Bridger‚ÄìTeton National Forest"},{"id":"2231110","text":"thumb300pxrightThe Saudi‚ÄìKuwait Neutral Zone (2 December 1922 ‚Äì 18 January 1970) (Established by the Uqair Convention of December 1922) The Saudi‚ÄìKuwaiti neutral zone, also known as the Divided Zone, was an area of between the borders of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait that was left undefined when the border was established by the Uqair Convention of 2 December 1922. In the area, which was later called the \\"Neutral Zone\\" or \\"Divided Zone\\", the Uqair Convention stated that \\"the Government of Najd and Kuwait will share equal rights until through the good offices of the Government of Great Britain a further agreement is made between Najd and Kuwait concerning it\\". However, there was little interest in a more definitive settlement in the so-called \\"Neutral Zone\\" until the discovery, in 1938, of oil in the Burgan (Burqan) of Kuwait. With the possibility of oil discovery within the \\"Neutral Zone\\" itself, concessions were granted in 1948‚Äì1949 by each government to private companies. Later the two countries exploited the oil under a joint operating agreement. In 1957, Saudi Arabia signed a concession agreement with the Japanese-owned Arab Oil Co., and Kuwait signed in 1958. That concession expired in 2000. The partitioning negotiations commenced shortly after the rulers of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia met and decided, in October 1960, that the Neutral Zone should be divided. On 7 July 1965, the two governments signed an agreement (which took effect on 25 July 1966) to partition the Neutral Zone adjoining their respective territories. A demarcation agreement dividing the Neutral Zone was signed on 17 December 1967 but did not formally take effect until the exchange of instruments and signing which took place in Kuwait on 18 December 1969. Ratification followed on 18 January 1970, and the agreement was published in the Kuwaiti Official Gazette on 25 January 1970. The zone was never assigned an ISO 3166 code since it was partitioned before the adoption of ISO 3166 in 1974.

Franc≈ìur was instructed in music by his father and joined the Acad√©mie Royale de Musique as a violinist at age 15. After travel and performances in the principal European culture centres, he returned to Paris as a member of the Concert Spirituel. Franc≈ìur was appointed to the 24 violons du roy in 1730 and Ma√Ætre de musique (music instructor) to the Opera in 1739. In 1744, he and Fran√ßois Rebel, his lifelong colleague and friend, were appointed inspecteurs musicaux (music directors) of the Paris Op√©ra‚Äîcentre of the French music world‚Äîbecoming responsible for all phases of its management in 1757. Rebel and Franc≈ìur faced numerous challenges in their joint roles, including a large financial deficit, lack of discipline, as well as handling contentious disagreements between traditionalists who favored French operatic tragedies and its mythological themes versus partisans of Italian opera's simpler lyricism and contemporary subject matter, known as the Querelle des Bouffons. King Louis XV appointed Franc≈ìur as his Music Master in 1760, ennobling Rebel in the same year and Franc≈ìur himself in May 1764. Disaster struck when the Paris Op√©ra was consumed in flames on 6 April 1763, and the two directors were forced to resign in 1767 in its aftermath. However, Louis XV asked Rebel to return to the Op√©ra as Administrateur g√©n√©ral in 1772, a position he held until shortly before his death three years later. Franc≈ìur resigned himself from the music world, living in retirement until his own death in 1787 at age 89. He was thus spared the fate of his nephew, Louis-Joseph Franc≈ìur, Master of the King's Chamber music and orchestra director, who was imprisoned during the French Revolution until the fall of Robespierre in 1794. ==Compositions== Le Troph√©e, divertissement √† l'occasion de la Victoire de Fontenoi... Repr√©sent√© par l'Acad√©mie royale de musique le mardy 10 aoust 1745.... Les paroles sont de M. de Moncrif... (Musique imprim√©e) (14764350525) His surviving compositions, published in Propyl√§en der Musik, V. 2 (1989), include two books of violin sonatas, 10 operas (including one about the life of Skanderbeg) and some ballets, created jointly with Fran√ßois Rebel. Thus he is often quoted as a relatively rare case of collaboration in musical composition. A sicilienne and rigaudon were initially attributed to him, in a publication by Fritz Kreisler, but were eventually revealed to be the work of Kreisler himself. ==Recordings== Recordings of Franc≈ìur's works include a noteworthy LP, Music for the Wedding of the Count d'Artois, on the Musical Heritage label, and the Cypres CD 1626 Suites de Simphonies, including what may be the same set of works by Franc≈ìur. Hugo Reyne and La Simphonie du Marais also recorded the Symphonies pour le Festin Royal du Comte d'Artois.Simphonie du Marais There is a 2003 recording of Franc≈ìur's Sonata in E for Cello and Piano on Delos by Zuill Bailey which shows off this composer to advantage. The opera Pirame et Thisbe, a collaborative work with Rebel, was released in 2008, and Z√©lindor, Roi des Sylphes and Le Troph√©e were released in 2009. ==Musicological and stylistic notes== Especial emphasis is placed on the above recordings for musicological as well as aesthetic reasons. In the transition from ages relatively little interested in earlier music (19th and early 20th century) to an age where a professional specialization in \\"ancient music\\" has arisen, composers like Franc≈ìur, who had relatively modest instrumental production or did not in other ways attract special professional attention, have often remained in obscurity. It is easy to see from Franc≈ìur's inventiveness and infectious rhythmic drive why he was esteemed in his lifetime. Had Louis XVI had him as a music instructor earlier in his life, instead of, as biographers suggest, a musical mediocrity who chilled his interest in the violin, he might have become a royal composer like Frederick the Great of Prussia. Franc≈ìur is sometimes categorised amongst the \\"Classical-era\\" composers who avoided the \\"classical style of Haydn and Mozart\\". The surviving music of Franc≈ìur (supposedly composed close to 1773), though contemporary with that of Haydn and Mozart, shows relatively few of the courtly mannerisms that abound in classical music directly sponsored by royalty. Rather, it has more of an \\"advanced Rococo\\" character, spicing strings with creative use of wind instruments. This kind of music seems to have been especially favoured by the rising bourgeoisie and lesser aristocracy in mercantile centres like London, Hamburg, Frankfurt as well as Paris, who provided an increasing market for musical composition. ==WorksOperas (with Fran√ßois Rebel) === * Pirame et Thisb√©, trag√©die en musique (1726) * Tarsis et Z√©lie, trag√©die en musique (1728) * Scanderberg, trag√©die en musique (1735), 33 performances * Le ballet de la paix, ballet h√©ro√Øque (1738) * Les Augustales, divertissement (1744) * Z√©lindor, roi des sylphes, divertissement (1745) * Le troph√©e, divertissement (1745) * La f√©licit√©, ballet h√©ro√Øque (1746) * Ism√®ne, pastorale h√©ro√Øque (1747) * Le prince de Noisy, ballet h√©ro√Øque in 3 acts, libretto by Charles-Antoine Leclerc de La Bru√®re, f.p.

In Corella's debut year with American Ballet Theatre, during a performance of Twyla Tharp's Americans We, The New York Times praised Corella's performance saying the ballet \\"explodes with this young dancer‚Äôs phenomenal bravura. Don‚Äôt miss him.\\" Increasing interest from audience and critics alike led quickly to more demanding principal roles. In his debut as the lead in the epic ballet La Bayadere the critic read \\"Angel Corella was nothing short of perfect.\\" Described as a virtuoso for his trademark feats of endurance \\"extremely fast pirouettes suddenly speeding up rather than slowing down\\" Corella excelled in the most demanding roles of the classical repertoire.

In 1998 a young Corella appeared on the long-running children's television show Sesame Street. After chatting with the likes of Elmo, Corella danced a rendition of the alphabet. In 2006 Corella appeared alongside Gwyneth Paltrow in the big-budget Christmas commercial for the luxury cava Freixenet.

He was First Deputy Chief of the Russian Presidential Administration from 1999 to 2011, during which time he was often viewed as the main ideologist of the Kremlin who proposed and implemented the concept of sovereign democracy in Russia. From December 2011 until May 2013, Surkov served as the Russian Federation's Deputy Prime Minister. After his resignation, Surkov returned to the Presidential Executive Office and became a personal adviser of Vladimir Putin on relationships with Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Ukraine. He was fired from this duty by presidential order in February 2020. Surkov is perceived by many to be a key figure with much power and influence in the administration of Vladimir Putin. According to The Moscow Times, this perception is not dependent on the official title Surkov might hold at any one time in the Putin government. BBC documentary filmmaker Adam Curtis credits Surkov's blend of theater and politics with keeping Putin, and Putin's chosen successors, in power since 2000. Journalists in Russia and abroad have speculated that Surkov writes under the pseudonym Nathan Dubovitsky, although the Kremlin denies it. ==Early years== According to Surkov's official biography and birth certificate, he was born 21 September 1964 in Solntsevo, Lipetsk Oblast, Russian SFSR. As per other statements, he was born in 1962 in Shali, Checheno-Ingush ASSR. His birth name is sometimes reported to be Aslambek Dudayev. His parents, the ethnic Russian Zinaida Antonovna Surkova (born 1935) and the ethnic Chechen Yuriy (\\"Andarbek\\") Danil'bekovich Dudayev (1942‚Äì2014), were school teachers in Duba-yurt, Checheno-Ingush ASSR. Following the separation of his parents, his mother moved to Lipetsk and he was baptized into Eastern Orthodox Christianity. In an interview published in June 2005 in the German magazine Der Spiegel, Surkov stated that his father was ethnic Chechen and that he spent the first five years of his life in Chechnya,'Der Westen muss uns nicht lieben'.

From 1983 to 1985, Surkov served in a Soviet artillery regiment in Hungary, according to his official biography. However, former Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov stated in a 2006 TV interview that Surkov served in the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff (GRU) during the same time period.–°—É—Ä–∫–æ–≤, –í–ª–∞–¥–∏—Å–ª–∞–≤. lenta.ru. Retrieved 14 April 2020. After his military training, Surkov was accepted to Moscow Institute of Culture for a five-year program in theater direction, but spent only three years there. Surkov graduated from Moscow International University with a master's degree in economics in the late 1990s. ==Business career (1988‚Äì1998)== In the late 1980s, when the government lifted the ban against private businesses, Surkov started out in business. In 1987, he became head of the advertising department of Mikhail Khodorkovsky's businesses. From 1991 to April 1996, he held key managerial positions in advertising and PR departments of Khodorkovsky's Bank Menatep. From March 1996 to February 1997, he was at Rosprom, and since February 1997 with Mikhail Fridman's Alfa-Bank. In September 2004, Surkov was elected president of the board of directors of the oil products transportation company Transnefteproduct, but was instructed by Russia's prime minister Mikhail Fradkov to give up the position in February 2006. ==Political career (1999‚Äì)Deputy Chief of the Russian Presidential Administration 1999‚Äì2011=== After a brief career as a director for public relations on the Russian television ORT channel from 1998 to 1999, Surkov was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff of the President of the Russian Federation in 1999. During the beginning of his time in this role, Surkov's main appearances in public and in international media were as a public relations mouthpiece of the Kremlin. In August 2000, he confirmed that Gazprom would buy Vladimir Gusinsky's Media- Most, which at the time owned the only independent, nationwide Russian television channel, NTV. In September 2002, he stated on behalf of the Kremlin that they had decided not to return the statue of KGB founder Felix Dzerzhinsky that had been torn down during the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. After the 2003 Russian Duma elections, when the president's United Russia party got the most seats at 37.6%, Surkov delivered the Kremlin's enthusiastic response, saying \\"We are living in a new Russia now.\\" In March 2004, he was additionally appointed as aide to the president. Since 2006, Surkov has advocated a political doctrine he has called sovereign democracy, to counter democracy promotion conducted by the US and European states. Judged by some Western media as controversial, this view has not generally been shared by Russian media and the Russian political elite.On Wednesday Political Elite Agreed to Speak Common Language. ¬´Izvestia¬ª. 31 August 2006. Surkov sees this concept as a national version of the common political language that will be used when Russia talks to the outside world.

According to The Moscow Times, Surkov exerted his influence to have Ramzan Kadyrov appointed as acting Head of the Chechen Republic on 15 February 2007. Since this appointment, Kadyrov has gone on to serve two terms in office and has been accused of numerous humans rights abuses.See Ramzan Kadyrov ¬ß¬ß Accusations of human rights abuses In October 2009, Surkov warned that opening and modernization of Russia's political system, a need repeatedly stressed by President Dmitry Medvedev, could result in more instability, which \\"could rip Russia apart\\".Sirke M√§kinen, \\"Surkovian narrative on the future of Russia: making Russia a world leader.\\" Journal of Communist Studies and Transition Politics 27#2 (2011): 143‚Äì165. In September 2011, Mikhail Prokhorov quit the Right Cause party, which he had led for five months. He condemned the party as a puppet of the Kremlin and named Surkov the \\"main puppet master of the political process\\" (), according to a report in Russian-language magazine Korrespondent picked up by The New York Times.Kramer, Andrew E., and Ellen Barry, \\"Amid Political Rancor, Russian Party Leader Quits\\".

He also stated that \\"coercion to fraternal relations by force is the only method that has historically proven its effectiveness in the Ukrainian direction. I do not think that some other will be invented\\". Hacked emails In October 2016, Ukrainian hacker group CyberHunta released over a gigabyte of emails and other documents alleged to belong to Surkov. The 2,337 emails belonged to the inbox of Surkov's office email account, prm_surkova@gov.ru. The Kremlin suggested that the leaked documents were fake. The emails illustrate Russian plans to politically destabilize Ukraine and the coordination of affairs with major opposition leaders in separatist east Ukraine. The document release included a document sent by Denis Pushilin, former Chair of the People's Soviet of the Donetsk People's Republic, listing casualties that occurred from 26 May to 6 June 2014. It also included a 22-page outline of \\"a plan to support nationalist and separatist politicians and to encourage early parliamentary elections in Ukraine, all with the aim of undermining the government in Kiev.\\" == Criticism and depictions == Before the 2010 U.S.-Russia \\"Civil Society to Civil Society\\" (C2C) summit, a U.S. House of Representatives representative for the state of Florida's 27th district, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R), was the lead signatory of a written petition which called upon the Obama administration to suspend U.S. participation in the summit until Surkov was replaced as a delegate for the Russian side. In an interview with Radio Free Europe, Ros-Lehtinen explained that she objected to Surkov's attendance as she views him as \\"one of the main propagators of limiting freedom of speech in Russia, intimidating Russian journalists and representatives of opposition political parties\\". However, the summit went ahead despite her objections. A 2007 Open Source Center \\"Media Aid\\" document identifies the Russian ura.ru information website as reportedly having links to Surkov. Inside Russia, Surkov has drawn criticism from activists and opposition groups: In September 2010, Lyudmila Alexeyeva appealed to then- president Dmitry Medvedev to dismiss him. Opposition leaders Boris Nemtsov (Solidarnost), Vladimir Milov (Democratic Choice), and Vladimir Ryzhkov (People's Freedom Party) jointly demanded his resignation over policies perceived to threaten freedom of the press and journalists in Russia. Igor Ivanovich Strelkov, who played a key role in the Russian military intervention in Ukraine, referred to Surkov as a \\"notorious\\" person who \\"focuses only on destruction...as in South Ossetia and other regions where he focused on looting rather than aide\\" (). In 2013, Surkov was characterized by The Economist as the engineer of \\"a system of make-believe\\", \\"a land of imitation political parties, stage-managed media and fake social movements\\". In Western media outside Russia, a vocal and eloquent critic of Surkov and of the administration of Vladimir Putin in general has been Peter Pomerantsev. Pomerantsev has written op-eds in The Atlantic, The New York Times, and the London Review of Books accusing Surkov, \\"Putin's chief ideologue\\" with \\"unsurpassed influence over Russian politics\\", of turning Russia into a \\"managed democracy\\", and of reducing Russian politics to nothing but \\"postmodernist theatre\\". In a talk before the Legatum Institute, Pomerantsev, along with Pavel Khodorkovsky, termed Russia a \\"postmodern dictatorship\\". === Rumored pseudonym of Nathan Dubovitsky === On 13 August 2009, Russian business newspaper Vedomosti reported that an anonymous source told them that a recently released novel, Close to Zero ('), was written by Surkov under the pseudonym Nathan Dubovitsky () in the magazine Russian Pioneer (). It was soon realized that the pseudonym is almost identical to the name of Surkov's second and current wife, Natalya Dubovitskaya (). In a subsequent edition of Close to Zero, Surkov would write a preface to it under his real name, but would continue to deny writing the main text. In the preface, Surkov writes two seemingly contradictory statements: \\"The author of this novel is an unoriginal Hamlet-obsessed hack\\"; and, \\"this is the best book I have ever read\\". Furthermore, the debut performance of the theatrical version of the novel, directed by Kirill Serebrennikov, was attended by Surkov. The novel, which has the English language subtitle \\"gangsta fiction\\", has as its protagonist a man by the name of Yegor Samokhodov. Samokhodov's occupation is public relations, and he is tasked with managing the reputation of a regional governor. First, he hires a writer to ghostwrite a piece of poetry to be published under the name of the governor without disclosing the ghostwriting, so that the governor may win an award and seem clever to his constituents. He then bribes a newspaper reporter to \\"correct\\" stories that portray the governor negatively, such as allegations that a factory of a relative of his is releasing chemicals into the air that harm local children. The publishing houses and public relations firms in the novel are intensely violent, with each company having its own gang and turf wars being fought over the rights to publish or represent such acclaimed Russian authors as Alexander Pushkin and Vladimir Nabokov. Peter Pomerantsev described the book as \\"exactly the sort of book Surkov's youth groups burn on Red Square.\\" The Economist wrote that the novel \\"expos[ed] the vices of the system [Surkov] himself had created\\".\\"The long life of Homo sovieticus\\". The Economist. 10 December 2011 (issue date). Retrieved 8 December 2011. Other works authored under the name Nathan Dubovitsky, all published in Russian Pioneer, that are rumored to be the work of Surkov are: * The Little Car and the Bicycle [gaga saga] () (2012) * Uncle Vanya [cover version] (2014) ()http://ruspioner.ru/cool/m/single/4103 * Without Sky (2014) () *Ultranormality (2017) (Russian: –£–ª—å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–æ—Ä–º–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å) === Influence outside Russia === Some outside Russia, such as Ned Reskinoff of ThinkProgress, and Adam Curtis in the BBC documentary HyperNormalisation, have claimed that Surkov's unique blend of politics and theatre have begun to affect countries outside of Russia, most notably the United States with the selection of Donald Trump for the 2016 US Republican nomination and Trump's subsequent campaign and election victory. In an editorial for the London Review of Books quoted by Curtis, Peter Pomerantsev describes Putin's Russia thus: Curtis claims that Trump used a similar strategy to become president of the United States, and hints that Trump's Surkovian origins caused Putin to express his admiration for Trump in Russian media. Surkov has boasted that \\"Russia is playing with the West‚Äôs minds\\", \\"They don't know how to deal with their own changed consciousness.\\" ==Personal life== Surkov has married twice. His first marriage, to Yulia Petrovna Vishnevskaya (, n√©e Lukoyanova, –õ—É–∫–æ—èÃÅ–Ω–æ–≤–∞) in 1987, ended in divorce in 1996.

During the first stage of the Finnish War, the Swedish commander Wilhelm Mauritz Klingspor had decided to retreat from southern Finland, so that the Swedes would gain time, and more troops could be moved to Finland via Tornio. The retreat was also made in an effort to delay battles until the seas thawed, and to reserve troops in case the Danes took the opportunity to attack Sweden. The Battle of Pyh√§joki, which had been fought two days earlier, was one of the first skirmishes of the war, but Siikajoki was the first major attempt to stop the advancing Russians. Carl Johan Adlercreutz had been appointed commander after Count Gustaf L√∂wenhielm had been captured by the Russian at Pyh√§joki. The force commanded by Georg Carl von D√∂beln was trying to cross the Siikajoki River when the Russians caught up with his force. Von D√∂beln decided to take a stance on the south bank of the river. He first ordered a counterattack, but was forced to pull back. At that point the Russian center opened up and the newly appointed General-Adjutant Adlercreutz ordered another attack, which threw the Russians back and halted their advance. The Battle of Siikajoki is described in the poem \\"Adlercreutz\\" in Runeberg's epic Tales of Ensign St√•l. The Nyland Regiment distinguished themselves at the battle, and today the Siikajoki Cross can be worn by soldiers of the Nyland Brigade, which is the traditional heir, though now part of the Finnish Navy. ==Notes, citations and sourcesNotes=Citations=Sources=== * == External links == Siikajoki Siikajoki 1808 Category:Siikajoki Category:1808 in Finland Siikajoki Siikajoki Category:April 1808 events Category:History of North Ostrobothnia ","title":"Battle of Siikajoki"},{"id":"2231127","text":"Vitis riparia Michx, with common names riverbank grape or frost grape, is a vine indigenous to North America. As a climbing or trailing vine, it is widely distributed across central and eastern Canada and the central and northeastern parts of the United States, from Quebec to Texas, and eastern Montana to Nova Scotia. There are reports of isolated populations in the northwestern USA, but these are probably naturalized. It is long-lived and capable of reaching into the upper canopy of the tallest trees. It produces dark fruit that are appealing to both birds and people, and has been used extensively in commercial viticulture as grafted rootstock and in hybrid grape breeding programs. Riverbank grape is a translation of the scientific name Vitis riparia; means \\"of riverbanks\\" in Latin, deriving from \\"riverbank\\". == Description == Mature vines have loose, fissured bark, and may attain several inches in diameter. Leaves are alternate, often with opposite tendrils or inflorescences, coarsely toothed, long and broad, sometimes with sparse hairs on the underside of veins. V. riparia is functionally dioecious. The inflorescence is a panicle long and loose, and the flowers are small, fragrant, and white or greenish in color. V. riparia blooms sometime between April and June and in August or September produces a small blue-black berry (grape) with a bloom, seeded, juicy, edible, vinous in flavor, lacking the \\"foxy\\" characteristics of Vitis labrusca, but usually quite sour and herbaceous. V. riparia has a wide range and may deviate considerably in detail from the above general description. White berries, perfect flowers, large clusters, large berries, and sweet fruit are among the known variations. However, some observers consider such variations as evidence of natural hybridization with other species of grapes. == Habitat == Vitis riparia has the largest geographical range of any of the North American Vitis species. It is present across nearly the entire eastern half of North America, from southern Quebec, to Piedmont, Alabama, and the Carolinas but absent of the coastal plains and the westerner parts of North America of the great plains. Variants of the species have been observed as far north as Riding Mountain National Park in Manitoba, Canada and as far west as Montana, Nebraska, and North Dakota. In the wild, the vine thrives along exposed areas with good sun exposure and adequate soil moisture, such as riverbanks, forest clearings, fence lines and along road sides. The species has adapted to a variety of soil chemistries. Frost grapes (Southeast Michigan) Frost grapes, immature grapes, and leaves (Late summer, Southeast Michigan) == Cold hardiness and disease resistance == Some V. riparia vines have been known to withstand temperatures as low as .Rombough, Lon. The Grape Grower Chelsea Green Publishing, 2002. p. 218. The foliage is typically resistant to mildew and black rot, and the roots resistant to phylloxera. The berries, however, are often sensitive to mildew and black rot if the vine is exposed to prolonged wet and humid conditions. == Uses == Perhaps the most significant agricultural usage of V. riparia is as grafted rootstock for Vitis vinifera. Important advantages of the use of V. riparia (and hybrids between it and other Vitis species) include resistance to phylloxera and adaptation to variant soil types. Due to the extensive cold hardiness and fungal disease resistance of this species, it has been used extensively in grape breeding programs to transfer cold hardy and disease resistant genes to domesticated grapes. The French-American hybrid grapes are notable examples of these attempts. V. riparia has been used extensively for over a hundred years to create hardy hybrids. Many V. riparia hybrids are currently being used and investigated by plant breeders and in breeding programs such as those conducted by the University of Minnesota's horticulture program in an effort to make a commercially viable wine grape that can survive the northern climate of the Upper Midwest. Examples of commercially important cultivars with significant V. Riparia ancestry include Baco noir, Marechal Foch, Triomphe d'Alsace and Frontenac. While V. riparia shares many important characteristics with its cousin, Vitis vinifera, the small size of the berry (making it prone to predation by birds), the high acidity of its fruit (often up to 5% titratable acidity), the intense pigment of its juice, and the presence of herbaceous aromas in wine produced from it have made it unusable on its own for commercial viticulture. These grapes are sometimes used to make flavorful homemade jellies, jams, and wine. ==Gallery== File:Vitis riparia HabitusLeavesFruits BotGardBln0906.JPG Botanical garden in Berlin, Germany.

Several languages have been claimed to have such sounds, such as Margi and Bura in Nigeria. However, most researchers interpret them as having sequences of labial and coronal consonants, a rather common occurrence in Africa. The Y√©l√Æ Dnye language of Rossel Island, Papua New Guinea, appears to be unique in having distinct labial‚Äìalveolar and labial‚Äìpostalveolar places of articulation, as illustrated below. (The alveolars are fronted, and the post- alveolars only slightly retracted, so it may be best not to consider the latter to be retroflex as they are sometimes described.) {  font-size:larger;\\" - style=\\"vertical-align: center; font-size: small; height: 2em\\" !

These are sometimes mistakenly referred to as labial‚Äìalveolars, though they actually have a post-alveolar or palatal articulation instead of a true alveolar one. Something similar is found with the labialized alveolar stops in several Northwest and Northeast Caucasian languages such as Abkhaz and Lak. Although the double stop articulation may be more common, they are generally considered to be essentially labialized alveolars because the labial contact is light, and moreover the contact is between the inner surfaces of the lips, which are protruded as they are for [w]. This is quite different from the normal contact for [p] in these languages. The labial contact may also be realized as a trill. Compare the following minimal sets in Ubykh: { class= nowawlif - pregnantcherryto weave - ramto take out  } Some speakers of !X√≥√µ have a labial‚Äìdental allophone, (or ), of the bilabial click in some cases (Traill 1985: 103‚Äì104). Discounting clicks otherwise as having a velar/lingual airstream mechanism rather than a double articulation, nearly all other doubly articulated consonants in the world are labial‚Äìvelars.

The group has also released 18 annual \\"Best of\\" CDs featuring the show's regular cast members. The proceeds from the CDs and DVDs, usually released around Christmas, support the show's charity fund that assists San Diego residents in need.San Diego Union Tribune, January 3, 2006 == Programming history == The Dave, Shelly, and Chainsaw Show debuted in 1990, on KGB-FM as The Dawn Patrol. In 1992, the group moved to Rock 102 and changed the show's name to The Dave, Shelly, and Chainsaw Show, often referred to as simply DSC. In 1996, both radio stations were purchased by Jacor Broadcasting (which was later bought by Clear Channel). At that time, the show moved to 105.3 KIOZ (formerly KCBQ) .San Diego Union Tribune, May 16, 1997 DSC returned to KGB in 1997. In January 2010, the show was abruptly canceled by Clear Channel, with executives citing an \\"inability to reach an agreement\\" with the performers.San Diego Union Tribune, January 4, 2010 The cast denied any agreement was even attempted. Fans of the show protested and staged rallies, to no avail.San Diego Union Tribune, January 13, 2010 The show remained off the air until August 2, 2010, when it was picked up by Jack 100.7 FM. The show initially featured Rickards and Randolph, without Dunn, who was still under contract with Clear Channel.San Diego Union Tribune, July 15, 2010 100.7 dropped DSC in the summer of 2018, after which the show returned once again to KGB. In addition to Rickards, Dunn, and Randolph, the show includes a support cast consisting of Chris Boyer; producer Emily Maguire, who screens listener calls; Nina Reeba (known as Ruth 66); and Elaina Smith, affectionately dubbed the \\"Mexican Leprechaun\\" by other members of the show. While Dunn was in a contract dispute with Clear Channel, Smith substituted for Dunn on air. Former cast members have included sports producer David \\"Bromo\\" Abromowitz and Shelly Brown (who was nicknamed \\"Chucko\\" to avoid confusion with Shelly Dunn). == Film development == ;The J-K Conspiracy The J-K Conspiracy is a 2004 film directed by Chainsaw, and produced jointly by Dave, Shelly, and Chainsaw. The film stars the entire cast of The Dave, Shelly, and Chainsaw Show. The story is a semi-fictional tale, written by Jules Hypenstein and based on a real event that took place several years before the movie was made. Plot: The J through K volume of Chainsaw's World Book encyclopedia has been stolen and (in the movie) Chainsaw accuses Dave of stealing it, triggering a comedic misadventure with guest appearances by co-starring Bob Costas, Dom Irrera, Doug Flutie, Davy Jones, Dr. Laura Schlessinger, and Don Rickles. Along the way, viewers get an inside look at real-life flashbacks, radio station politics, bizarre secret meetings, and conspiracy theories, along with the night life parties, sporting events, and live comedy. ;The Trouble With Money The Trouble with Money is the second film produced by Dave, Shelly, and Chainsaw. Plot: Shamus O'Reilly is supposed to receive $1 million for a scandalous videotape desperately wanted by notorious businessman Kaiser Poppo. Before Shamus arrives for the switch, Poppo's thugs accidentally give the money to Shamus look-alike Dave Rickards, a local radio host in the wrong place at the wrong time. Rickards is chased through the streets of downtown San Diego and onto a train, where he makes a clean getaway with the cash. Now Poppo not only wants the videotape but his money back and must contend with the FBI, con men, and his long-time nemesis \\"The Greek\\". Despite advice from San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders and Watergate legend G. Gordon Liddy, Rickards loses track of both the money and the videotape. He is then tricked into a dramatic showdown with Poppo, and the secret of the videotape is finally revealed.

There is no universally accepted resolution to this confusion, and it is possible that there were two separate tyrants who held power in Athens in quick succession during the First Mithridatic War whose stories became conflated together. This is the most commonly accepted explanation for the confusion between the two figures. Athenion was likely an Athenian citizen and Peripatetic philosopher that was elected hoplite general in 88 BC. Aristion is a fellow Peripatetic philosopher who seized the reigns of Athenian government in c. 88 BC. Aristion was the illegitimate son of a Peripatetic philosopher to whose party he succeeded, and so became an Athenian citizen. He married early, and began at the same time to teach philosophy, which he did with great success at Messene and Larissa. On returning to Athens with a considerable fortune, he was named ambassador to Mithridates, king of Pontus, then at war with Rome, and became one of his most intimate friends and counsellors. His letters to Athens represented the power of Mithridates in such glowing colours, that his countrymen began to conceive of hopes of throwing off Roman rule. Mithridates then sent him to Athens around 88 BC, where he soon contrived, through the king's patronage, to assume the tyranny. His government seems to have been of the most cruel character, so that he is spoken of with horror by Plutarch,Plutarch, Praecept. ger. Reip. and classed by him with Nabis and Catiline. He sent Apellicon of Teos to plunder the sacred treasury of Delos, though Appian says that this had already been done for him by Mithridates,Appian, Mithrid. and adds that it was by means of the money resulting from this robbery that Aristion was enabled to obtain supreme power. Meanwhile, Sulla landed in Greece, and immediately laid siege to Athens and Piraeus, the latter of which was occupied by Archelaus, the general of Mithridates. The sufferings within the city from famine were so dreadful that cannibalism was reported. Eventually Athens was stormed, and Sulla gave orders to spare neither age nor sex. Aristion fled to the Acropolis, having first burned the Odeon, in case Sulla should use the woodwork for battering rams and other instruments of attack. The Acropolis, however, was soon taken, and Aristion dragged to execution from the altar of Athena and poisoned. Pausanias attributes the unpleasant disease that later killed Sulla as divine vengeance for this impiety.Pausanias, i. 20. 4 ==NotesAttribution== Category:1st- century BC Greek people Category:86 BC deaths Category:Athenian tyrants Category:Roman-era Athenian philosophers Category:Hellenistic-era philosophers in Athens Category:Year of birth unknown Category:People executed by the Roman Republic Category:People executed by poison ","title":"Aristion"},{"id":"2231142","text":"Astraea Redux, written by John Dryden in 1660, is a royalist panegyric in which Dryden welcomes the new regime of King Charles II. It is a vivid emotional display that overshadows the cautious Heroique Stanzas that Dryden composed for Oliver Cromwell's death. In the former, Dryden apologizes for his allegiance with the Cromwellian government. Dryden was later excused by Samuel Johnson for this change in allegiance when he wrote, 'if he changed, he changed with the nation.' The period between Cromwell and the Restoration is presented in Astraea as a time of chaos, and Charles is greeted as a restorer of peace. In the traditional form of the panegyric, Charles is praised for qualities which it is hoped he will attain as well as for those he already possesses, and Dryden recommends that Charles adopt a policy of toleration. The poem well illustrates Dryden's lifelong commitment to peace and political stability. It also that Dryden was looking for a royal patron. The name of the poem Astraea Redux is defined in The Nuttall Encyclopaedia as \\"an era which piques itself on the return of the reign of justice to the earth.\\" The poem's title is a reference to Greek goddess Astraea, a personification of justice. ==References *Text of the poem Category:1660 poems Category:Charles II of England Category:Panegyrics Category:Poetry by John Dryden ","title":"Astraea Redux"},{"id":"2231147","text":"is the video game character of the eponymous Tingle series. He was originally part of The Legend of Zelda series, first appearing in The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. Since his first appearance, he has appeared in each installment of the series up through Spirit Tracks, except for Twilight Princess. He has gone on to be the star of video games for the Nintendo DS: Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland, currently released in Japan and Europe, and the Japan exclusive games Tingle's Balloon Fight DS, Irozuki Tincle no Koi no Balloon Trip, as well as the DSiWare application Dekisugi Tingle Pack. ==Concept and creation== Tingle was created by Takaya Imamura, a game designer at Nintendo EAD. According to an interview with Kensuke Tanabe, producer of Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland, character designer Imamura created Tingle in a \\"very relaxed manner.\\" He was also in charge of the character design of the games F-Zero and Star Fox. In an interview with Electronic Gaming Monthly, director Eiji Aonuma stated that he had \\"found out some American people didn't like him very much\\" and ultimately decided not to include him in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess as a result.Electronic Gaming Monthly, June 2005, Ziff-Davis In a later interview with Nintendo Dream, he stated that the character Purlo is his reference to Tingle in Twilight Princess. According to Aonuma, Purlo's appearance \\"is the result of wondering what a realistic Tingle would look like\\". ==Characteristics== Tingle, in his Wind Waker form is a short, pudgy 35-year-old, while Tingle, in his Majora's Mask form, is an averaged-sized, paunchy 35-year-old Tingle: \\"Alas, though I am already age 35, no fairy has come to me yet...\\" Tingle Figurine: \\"It's been several years since Tingle first became enchanted with deciphering maps in the hopes it would help him find fairies, and he's lost many things during that time. He's raising funds to begin his search for fairies, hoping to embark sometime in his thirties, while the lust of life is still upon him. At the age of 35, the pressure's on!\\" man who is obsessed with \\"forest fairies\\" and dresses up in a green costume, slightly resembling that of Link. He also wears tight red shorts and a necklace with a clock that is permanently stuck at four o'clock. Tingle is normally seen floating around on his red balloon drawing and selling maps for his father, who runs the Southern Swamp pictograph contest and sees Tingle as \\"a fool\\". He is also known for his catchphrase: \\"Tingle, Tingle! Kooloo- Limpah!\\" . Tingle appears to have a fixation for Rupees and other similar collectibles, such as Force Gems in Four Swords Adventures and Kinstones in The Minish Cap. In Majora's Mask, Tingle can be found selling maps, and in The Wind Waker, he translates Triforce Maps for a high price, among other things. Tingle's fixation for Rupees is explained in the Nintendo DS game Freshly- Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland, where it is stated that he needs Rupees to live. He is known to dress as a fairy. ===Siblings=== Ankle is Tingle's younger brother and Knuckle's twin. In The Wind Waker, he is found turning the grinding wheel at Tingle Tower with David Jr.. The reason he does so much work is to support his brother, Knuckle. He also has a love of gardening. He also appears in Four Swords Adventures and later in The Minish Cap, where he fuses Kinstones behind Lon Lon Ranch. His outfit is faded purple. Knuckle is Ankle's twin and the one who built Tingle Tower. In The Wind Waker, he is largely a side-quest character, requiring use of the Tingle Tuner to find. By doing so, Link can gain the Hand-Me-Down Tuner which provides additional options. He also appears in Four Swords Adventures and later in The Minish Cap, where he fuses Kinstones in Trilby Highlands. His outfit is light blue. David Jr., although similar in appearance to Tingle and his brothers, is from Windfall Island and is unrelated to Tingle. After getting shipwrecked on Tingle Island, he was forced by Tingle to work turning the wheel. Unenthusiastic about his role, he does it anyway, although he is prone to complaining. When reading his inscription in the Nintendo Gallery, it implies that his father was the one who made the ghost ship chart, but died immediately after doing so. He also appears in Four Swords Adventures and The Minish Cap, the latter of which sees him fusing Kinstones in Lake Hylia. His outfit is white. ==AppearancesThe Legend of Zelda series=== Tingle made his debut in the Nintendo 64 game Majora's Mask. Throughout Link's adventure, Tingle helps Link navigate Termina by selling him maps of various areas. Tingle appears in Clock Town, Southern Swamp, Woodfall, Mountain Village, Milk Road, Great Bay, Ikana Valley, Stone Tower, and outside Zora Hall. His father operates the pictograph contest at the Woodfall Swamp, and is ashamed by his son's antics, although he admits that perhaps he spoiled him too much. Tingle doesn't appear in Oracle of Seasons but does appear in Oracle of Ages, giving Link a chart that he needs to cross the sea. He also gives Link upgrades to the Seed Satchel, the first increasing its capacity to 50 of every seed and the second (available only in a linked game) to 99 of every seed. Tingle's first appearance in The Wind Waker is in a small, dingy prison cell on Windfall Island. He was imprisoned for being mistaken for a troublemaker. When freed, Tingle gives Link the Tingle Tuner, a device that can be used if the player connects a Game Boy Advance to the GameCube via the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable. This allows a second player to control Tingle and assist Link by selling him potions, providing him with a shield, and allowing him to float and drop bombs. However, in the Wii U remake, Tingle gives Link the Tingle Bottle, which can be used to post on Miiverse, instead of the Tingle Tuner. Tingle also gives the player a crudely drawn map to Tingle Island, and can be found for the rest of the game on this island, near the top of Tingle Tower. According to the Tingle Tuner, Tingle is merely a native of a different island with a Tingle-centric legend, in parallel to the Link-centric legend of Outset Island. He deciphers the charts needed to haul the Triforce Shards from the ocean floor. He is also known for his extortionate prices; he demands 398 Rupees per chart, plus 201 Rupees for the IN-credible Chart that shows the location of the Triforce Charts and Triforce Shards from the charts that have been deciphered. This game also introduced his brothers, Ankle and Knuckle, who are twins, and David Jr., who is not related but was (supposedly) saved by Tingle after his ship was sucked into a cyclone. Tingle appears in the GameCube game Four Swords Adventures. If a player leaves a good deal of Force Gems lying around for too long, Tingle will eventually float towards them on his balloon to steal them. The players must grab them before he does (although while playing multi-player, players are given the option of turning this off). There is also a trap in this game that causes Tingle to lead an army of lookalikes and steal the gems directly from the Links. Tingle, Ankle, Knuckle, and David Jr. are able to fuse Kinstones with Link in the Game Boy Advance game The Minish Cap. Fusing Kinstones is an action that Link can do with many people, animals, and seemingly inanimate objects throughout the game, which influences the game world to give Link access to an item or new area. When all four have fused Kinstones with Link, a passage will open on the Castle Grounds that gives him the Magic Boomerang. Tingle, his brothers, and David Jr. can also tell Link how many Kinstone fusions remain. Once Link has done every Kinstone fusion, Tingle will award Link with the Tingle statue. In Phantom Hourglass, Tingle makes a small appearance in Mercay Island's bar, as a poster on the wall. In Spirit Tracks, a small Tingle figurine is in Hyrule Castle Town's shop and Linebeck III's shop. In Skyward Sword, a Tingle doll can be seen in Zelda's room at the Knight Academy. Tingle appears as an additional playable character in Hyrule Warriors via the Majora's Mask DLC pack. In Breath of the Wild the main character Link is able to discover and wear a Tingle outfit made available via a DLC pack. ===Tingle series=== Freshly- Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland Tingle's first starring role was in the spin-off title game known as Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland for the Nintendo DS. It tells the story of Tingle as a simple, 35-year-old man who ended up becoming a Tingle after meeting a character known as Uncle Rupee. The game explain why all of Tingle's incarnations have been so obsessed with Rupees, as well as why he wears his 'fairy suit'. The game was released in Japan in 2006 and one year later in Europe on September 14. Although the game scored high reviews in both Japan and Europe, it never saw a North American release. This was likely due to a poll on Nintendo's website asking if the game should be brought to America. The poll slightly swung against an American release due to the poor perception that Tingle had received in the region. Tingle's Balloon Fight is a Nintendo DS arcade style platformer published and developed by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS handheld video game console, which is solely available to Platinum Club Nintendo members. The game itself is based not only on The Legend of Zelda, but on Balloon Fight as well, making this the third entry in the latter franchise (following the first title and Balloon Kid). Tingle's Balloon Fight uses the same game design as Balloon Fight. The game has three modes: Balloon Fight (single player), local wireless Balloon Fighting Spirit (2‚Äì4 players), and Balloon Trip (single-player). Performing various accomplishments throughout the game (winning multiplayer matches, achievements in scoring, and other as yet unknown methods) unlocks artwork in a gallery of Tingle portraits, available on the Options screen of the game. The game was released exclusively to members of Club Nintendo in Japan. Irozuki Tingle no Koi no Balloon Trip An issue of the Japanese magazine Famitsu published in June 2009 contained a teaser advertisement depicting a tiny picture of Tingle along with a line of text saying Y≈çsei? („Çà„ÅÜ„Åõ„ÅÑ?, lit. \\"Fairy?\\"). On June 12, 2009, Nintendo opened a teaser website, hinting at an upcoming Nintendo DS game starring Tingle. Later, a DSiWare title named Dekisugi Tingle Pack (lit. \\"Too Much Tingle Pack\\") was released in Japan on June 24, which is a collection of Tingle themed applications. Another issue of Famitsu published in late June revealed a Nintendo DS game titled Irodzuki Tincle no Koi no Balloon Trip (lit. \\"Ripening Tingle's Balloon Trip of Love\\"), which is a sequel to Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland. It was released in Japan on August 6, 2009. Dekisugi Tingle Pack Dekisugi Tingle Pack (lit. \\"Too Much Tingle Pack\\") is a DSiWare application that includes several different minigames, including a fortune-teller, calculator, timer, coin-flipper and dancing game. It was released on June 24, 2009 as a promotional application for Irozuki Tingle no Koi no Balloon Trip. ===Other roles=== Tingle appears in Super Smash Bros. Melee as part of the Termina Bay stage, as well as an Assist Trophy in Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. In those games, he threw out a large amount of items that could quickly be grabbed by all of the fighters. However, he would sometimes just float away, not doing anything. He also appears as a trophy in those games, the former based on Majora's Mask and the latter two based on The Wind Waker. Tingle also appears in Super Mario Maker as one of the unlockable \\"Mystery Mushroom\\" outfits. ==Impact and reception== The editors at IGN did not like Tingle, in part because his role in The Wind Waker was an integral part of \\"tedious fetch quests\\". They titled the article \\"IGNcube's 2004 \\"Die, Tingle, Die! Die!\\" Campaign.\\" When development for Twilight Princess began, IGN hoped that game directors Shigeru Miyamoto and Eiji Aonuma would not include the character, saying \\"we're not going to stand for him in another Zelda game\\". Tingle ranked sixth on GameDaily's top 10 ugliest game characters list, stating that his face looks out of place. GamesRadar described him as \\"Zelda's Jar Jar\\". Nintendo Power listed Tingle as one of the three weirdos, describing him as both a great cartographer as well as a \\"fully grown man in a green elf costume who rides a balloon and says, 'Tingle! Tingle! Kooloo-Limpah!'\\". Fan distaste for Tingle led to his exclusion from Twilight Princess. PALGN editor Matt Keller stated that Tingle was widely considered the weakest part of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. IGN, among others, ranked him number 1 of the top 20 weirdest Zelda characters. However, many fans have stood up for Tingle, as well his respective game series. Criticism of the character primarily comes from Western gamers, but in Japan, Tingle has garnered a cult following, which resulted in the development of several spin-off games featuring Tingle as their star. In a 2013 interview with VentureBeat, Kensuke Tanabe had expressed interest in making another Tingle game, having stated: \\"I know that people cannot stand Tingle. But to me that challenge is: Could I take this character that is so reviled in the West and just [do] a complete turnaround and make him a beloved, fun character? The idea of that really just gets me going. I know we have made a Tingle game in the past, but maybe at some point down the road.\\" He later joked that \\"it's like romance: You meet someone and you're like, 'Oh god, I can't stand that person.' And then three weeks later, you're madly in love ‚Äì it's that turn, that quick whip, that motivates [me] a little bit.‚Äù ==References== Category:Fictional salespeople Category:Male characters in video games Category:Nintendo protagonists Category:Non-human characters in video games Category:The Legend of Zelda characters Category:Video game characters introduced in 2000 it:Personaggi di Majora's Mask#Tingle sv:Lista √∂ver rollfigurer i The Legend of Zelda-serien#Tingle ","title":"Tingle (character)"},{"id":"2231155","text":"Alina Cojocaru (born 27 May 1981) is a Romanian ballet dancer. She is currently a principal dancer with the English National Ballet, and formerly The Royal Ballet. ==Early years== Alina Cojocaru was born and raised in Bucharest, Romania. She has one sister. From a young age she studied gymnastics. Later she began ballet classes, despite never having seen a live ballet. ==Training== At the age of 7 or 8 she began gymnastic classes, progressing at the age of 9 to a Bucharest ballet school which acted as a feeder for the Romanian State Ballet school. Later the same year she took and passed the entrance exam for the school and a few months later was chosen (with 8 other Romanian students) by the director of the Kiev Ballet school to take part in a student exchange. She left her family to train at the school, and did not speak any Russian. Initially, Cojocaru and the other Romanian students were taught separately, before being integrated with the other students in the third year. The ballet school gave a public performance every six months and it was in one of these performances that Cojocaru made her debut, dancing the role of Amor in Don Quixote. In January 1997, aged 15, she competed in the Prix de Lausanne international ballet competition. There, she was awarded a six-month scholarship to train at the Royal Ballet School in London. In June she won a silver medal at the Moscow Ballet Competition and impressed the audience in Musketeer by Alla Rubina. She moved to London later that year to commence her training, but did not speak any English. Alina Cojocaru, Johan Kobborg, Laura Morera, curtain call for Mayerling, Royal Ballet, 10 April 2007. ==Professional career== After completing her six-month training with the Royal Ballet School, Cojocaru was offered a contract to join The Royal Ballet as a member of the corps de ballet. She was also offered a contract to join the Kiev Ballet as principal. She subsequently joined Kiev Ballet in November 1998, believing she would gain greater experience as a principal dancer. She stayed for one season, dancing a variety of roles. Whilst dancing with Kiev Ballet, Cojocaru re-applied to the Royal Ballet in London, but was only invited to audition for the corps de ballet. She attended an audition for the company whilst on leave from Kiev Ballet and was offered a contract. Doubtful of development opportunities elsewhere, she accepted the contract and joined the company in November 1999. She was subsequently promoted to principal dancer in 2001. In 2004, she received the Prix Benois de la Danse for her portrayal of Cinderella. Cojocaru's early appearances with the company included performing in the opening gala for the refurbished Royal Opera House, plus appearances with the corps de ballet in the Kingdom of the Shades from La Bayad√®re, as a snowflake in The Nutcracker and as a doll in Copp√©lia. One of the highlights of her career is her partnership with Danish principal dancer, Johan Kobborg. The partnership began in 2001 when they danced together in Romeo and Juliet after Cojocaru filled in for an injured Miyako Yoshida. Since then, Kobborg and Cojocaru's partnership has been named one of the greatest in the history of ballet, and they have danced together at Covent Garden and worldwide. In 2012, Cojocaru became the first ballerina to receive the Prix Benois de la Danse twice, this time for John Neumeier's Liliom with the Hamburg Ballet. The lead role of Julie also marked the first time a full-length ballet was created around Cojocaru. In June 2013, she announced that she and Kobborg would leave The Royal Ballet at the end of 2012/13 season. Their last performance in London was in Mayerling on 5 June, followed by scheduled performances on 10 and 12 July with the company in Tokyo. In July 2013, following her departure from the Royal Ballet, Cojocaru joined the English National Ballet as a principal dancer. The company is directed by her former Royal Ballet colleague Tamara Rojo She is also a guest at the Hamburg Ballet. She now split her time between London and Hamburg, where she developed a close creative relationship with John Neumeier. In December 2013, she also joined the Romanian National Ballet as a principal after Kobborg became the company's artistic director. However, in 2016, actions by new leadership at the Bucharest National Opera House resulted in both Kobborg and Cojocaru resigning, triggering protests by dancers. The new management then apparently banned them from even setting foot in the theatre. She won the Critics' Circle National Dance Awards 2017 Outstanding Female Performance (Classical) for her portrayal of the title role in Akram Khan's Giselle. In 2020, she performed a self produce show, Alina at Sadler's Wells at the Sadler's Wells Theatre. The show included Frederick Ashton's Marguerite and Armand, and Tim Rushton's Reminiscence, a new commissioned piece, which was danced with Johan Kobborg. ==Injury== In 2008, during rehearsal when an unidentified partner handled her awkwardly in a lift, Cojocaru suffered a whiplash injury that could have ended her career. But after surgery and months of rest, and following the rehabilitation regimen guided by Patrick Rump, she successfully recovered and eventually returned to dancing. ==On DVD== Cojocaru's performance as Clara in Peter Wright's Royal Ballet production of The Nutcracker was taped and first telecast in the US in 2001. It is available on DVD. Her performance as Aurora in the Royal Ballet's new production of The Sleeping Beauty has not been telecast in the US yet, but has become available on DVD. Her performance as Giselle, alongside Johan Kobborg as Albrecht was recorded in 2006, broadcast in England on Boxing Day, and released on DVD the following year. ==Personal life== Cojocaru lives with her fianc√©, Johan Kobborg. After Kobborg became her most frequent partner, it was publicly announced in 2005 that they were in a romantic relationship. In May 2011, Cojocaru was making a guest appearance at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, but her dance partner was injured so Kobborg flew over unexpectedly to fill in and surprised Cojocaru when he proposed to her on her 30th birthday. Their engagement was announced shortly afterward. In May 2017, Cojocaru announced on Twitter that she and Kobborg are expecting their first child. On 10 October 2017, Kobborg announced via Twitter that Cojocaru had given birth to their daughter Thalia Chulpan. On 31 July 2020, Cojocaru announced on Twitter that the couple are expecting their second child. ==References * Official website * Royal Opera biography * English National Ballet biography Category:Romanian ballerinas Category:English National Ballet principal dancers Category:Prix de Lausanne winners Category:Entertainers from Bucharest Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Principal dancers of The Royal Ballet Category:National Dance Award winners Category:Prix Benois de la Danse winners Category:Romanian expatriates in England Category:Prima ballerinas Category:21st-century ballet dancers ","title":"Alina Cojocaru"},{"id":"2231165","text":"Emma Millinda Gillett (1852‚Äì1927) was an American lawyer and women's rights activist who played a pivotal role in the advancement of legal studies for women. After being denied from local law schools because of her gender, she was admitted by Howard University, a historically black college and university. Yet, the Washington College of Law, which she founded in 1898, did not accept people of color until 1950. ==Early background== Gillett was born on July 30, 1852, in Princeton, Wisconsin, to Wisconsin homesteaders. She was educated in Girard, Pennsylvania, where her family moved following the death of her father. In 1870, she graduated from Lake Erie College and taught for the following ten years in the Pennsylvania public school system. During her time as a teacher, she became frustrated with the meager wages paid to single women teachers. After the death of her mother, Gillett's role in the settlement of her estate sparked an interest in law, as well as being a better paying profession. Encouraged by the news of Belva Lockwood, who had become the first female law student at National University in Washington, DC; Gillett moved to Washington in hopes of following in Lockwood's footsteps. Unfortunately, she found that National University had closed its doors to women. Gillette did gain admission at Howard University and graduated in 1882 with an LLB, followed in 1883 with an LLM. She passed the bar in the District of Columbia the same year. She also became first woman to be appointed a notary public by the president of the United States. ==Early career== Emma Gillett, 1902 After admission to the bar, she formed a partnership with Watson J. Newton, which continued until the death of Newton in 1913. At one time she was connected with the District Title Insurance Company and was later Vice President of the Realty Appraisal & Title Company. ==Educational career== During this time, her colleague and friend, Ellen Spencer Mussey, sought her assistance in the education of women in the field of law. Mussey had been approached in 1895 by Delia Sheldon Jackson, an aspiring attorney, to apprentice her as a student of law. Realizing both the scope of the task and the significance of the opportunity, Mussey sought out the assistance of Gillett. The two opened the first session of the Woman's Law Class on February 1, 1896. The class had an enrollment of three: Jackson and two other women, Nanette Paul and Helen Malcolm. Within a few years, the program had expanded and several prominent Washington, DC, attorneys were brought in for assistance. Although Mussey and Gillett had not initially aspired to establish an independent law school, when Columbian College (now George Washington University) refused their request to take on the women they had educated for their final year of education‚Äîon grounds that \\"women did not have the mentality for law\\"‚Äîthe two decided to establish a co-educational law school specifically open to women. Thus, in April 1898, the Washington College of Law‚Äìnewly merged with American University‚Äìwas incorporated in Washington, DC, as the first law school in the world founded by women. ==Accomplishments== Gillett helped in the establishment of a women's club, \\"The Wimondaughsis\\", in DC. With Ellen Spencer Mussey, her colleague and co-founder of the Washington College of Law, Gillett founded the Women's Bar Association of the District of Columbia. Responding to the written invitation issued by Mussey, calling an initial meeting of \\"an association of women lawyers in the District of Columbia\\" on May 17, 1917, 29 other women lawyers joined Gillett and Mussey as charter members of the Women's Bar Association of the District of Columbia. At that time, only New York City, Chicago, and Omaha had organized women's bar associations. Gillett held many additional roles, including Vice President for the District of Columbia of the American Bar Association in 1922; President of the State Suffrage Association of the District; President of the Women's Bar Association in 1921, and at the time of her death was Dean Emeritus of the Washington College of Law and Chairman of the Legal Branch of the National Woman's Party. ==Death== Gillett died on January 23, 1927, after contracting pneumonia while confined to her bed after breaking her hip the previous October. ==References== Category:1852 births Category:1927 deaths Category:American University people Category:American women lawyers Category:Howard University School of Law alumni Category:People from Erie County, Pennsylvania Category:People from Princeton, Wisconsin ","title":"Emma Gillett"},{"id":"2231180","text":"Achebe is a Nigerian surname of Igbo origin.

Parasol grew up in Mill Valley, California, graduated from Marin Academy in 1984, and received a B.A. in Business from the University of San Francisco in 1988. After earning her Juris Doctor from Western State College of Law at Argosy University in 1992, Parasol worked for her father's real estate management business. Parasol also amassed a small fortune in the business of online pornography and the operation of phone sex lines. In 2003, Parasol married Russ DeLeon. They moved with their children to Gibraltar in 2004. They separated in 2010, and were decreed divorced in early 2014. Parasol continues to reside primarily in Gibraltar and to maintain homes in Israel, London, and Spain. ==Involvement in the gaming industry== Parasol launched Starluck Casino Online in the Caribbean in 1997. In 1998, she made software engineer Anurag Dikshit a partner in her business, which later became known as PartyGaming Plc. In turn, Dikshit made Parasol a partner in his IT services business based in India. Vikrant Bhargava and Russ DeLeon joined as principals of Party Gaming in 2000 and 2001 respectively. Parasol and her ex-husband served as consultants to PartyGaming Plc until December 2006, and they sold their remaining shares in 2015. After the launch of PartyPoker.com in 2001, PartyGaming Plc grew to generate more than $500 million in annual profits by 2005. In June 2005, PartyGaming Plc floated its IPO on the London Stock Exchange at a value of ¬£4.64 billion ($8.46 billion), and in September of that year was admitted to the FTSE 100 list of companies. In October 2006, PartyGaming publicly withdrew from the U.S. market after the passage of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006,\\"Party Gaming Counts the Cost of US Withdrawal\\" Poker News. a piece of anti-gambling legislation approved by the United States Congress as part of the SAFE Port Act. As a result, the company‚Äôs share price dropped 60% and the company subsequently withdrew from the FTSE 100 Index. In 2008, Anurag Dikshit pleaded guilty to violation of the Federal Wire Act, agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, and personally paid $300 million to the United States Department of Justice as part of his plea. In 2009, PartyGaming entered a non-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department and paid a fine of $105 million. In 2011, the Justice Department reversed its earlier position, determining that the Federal Wire Act does not apply to online poker and casino games, only to sports betting.\\"PartyGaming‚Äôs Dikshit Pleads Guilty to Web Gambling\\" Bloomberg.

It was built in 1679 by the Ottomans, in order to contain the Inner Mani region. Some years later, in 1685, the Maniots besieged the castle. They sent messengers to Venice so the Doge could send a fleet to help them capture the castle. The Venetians were currently at war with the Ottomans so they agreed and sent a fleet under Francesco Morosini. As soon the fleets bearing the symbol of St Mark the Ottoman garrison surrendered. A year later the Ottomans returned with a strong force and laid siege to the castle but were driven back. Along with the rest of the Peloponnese, the castle remained in Venetian hands for about 30 years, but in 1715 the Ottomans recaptured the Peloponnese. Around 1780 the Ottomans abandoned the castle, which became derelict. Now Kelefa is a small village. ==Historical population== { class= ! Year !!

It is owned and operated by iHeartMedia and broadcasts a classic rock music format. KGB-FM's studios are located in San Diego's Kearny Mesa neighborhood on the northeast side, and the transmitter is located in East San Diego east of Balboa Park. The station has broadcast using the HD Radio digital transmission format since 2005. ==History== :See KLSD#History for the history of the letters 'KGB' used as a radio station name. The 101.5 MHz FM frequency originally signed on the air in 1950 as KSON-FM, owned by Fred Rabel. It is the second-oldest FM station in San Diego; the former KFSD- FM (now KMYI) at 94.1 FM debuted in 1948. Rabel later sold the signal to Brown Broadcasting in 1958. KSON-FM was moved off the KSON AM tower on the corner of Highway 15 and Interstate 5, to the new site of sister station KGB (1360 AM, now KLSD) at 52nd Street and Kalmia. KSON-FM's call letters were changed to KGB-FM. In 1964, Brown Broadcasting hired Bill Drake to consult for the new KGB as the format he installed there later became known as \\"Boss Radio\\". In 1964, KGB and KGB-FM were separated, and the latter became KBKB, a beautiful music station. By 1972, Boss Radio on KGB was failing and more focus was being given to KBKB. Brown Broadcasting hired Ron Jacobs to turn around the FM station. Jacobs' first move was to restore the KGB-FM call letters and to drop Boss Radio from 1360 AM. Jacobs created San Diego's first-ever freeform progressive album-oriented rock FM superstation, further nurtured by station general manager Sonny Jim Price. Among the innovations introduced during this era of KGB-FM is the station's iconic mascot, the \\"KGB Chicken\\" (now known as the \\"San Diego Chicken\\"), a series of records called the Homegrown albums, and the \\"Sky Show\\", a fireworks display set to rock music. KGB-FM has hosted many of San Diego's most prominent radio and television personalities. Such hosts include Lawrence \\"Larry The Cruiser\\" Himmel, Bob \\"B.C.\\" Coburn, Dave Benson, Damian Bragdon, Gabriel Wisdom, Erik Thompson, Jimmy McInnes, Ricky Leibert, Patrick Martin, Larry Bruce, Bill Hergonson, Ernesto Gladden, Ted Edwards, Linda McInnes, Digby Welch, Kevin McKeown, Pamela Edwards, Brian Schock, Susan Hemphill, Johnny Leslie, Andrew \\"Long Tall Andy\\" Geller, Blair and Kymythy Schultz, Philip Hendrie, Jeffrey Prescott, Michael Berger, Susan \\"Sue\\" Delaney, Coe Lewis, \\"Steve-o\\", Cynthia \\"Spicy Cindy\\" Spicer, Teddy \\"The Chicken\\" Giannoulas, and Mojo Nixon. KGB-FM news anchors include Bradley Messer, Brent Seltzer, with Gerry Gazlay, and George Wilson. One prominent longtime fixture on KGB-FM, and on San Diego rock radio in general, is The DSC Show. The morning zoo program, hosted by Davivd \\"Denver Dave\\" Rickards, Shelly Dunn, and Cookie \\"The Chainsaw\\" Randolph, debuted on KGB-FM in 1990 as The 101 KGB-FM's Dawn Patrol. In 1994, the program moved to KIOZ (originally at 102.1 FM, now at 105.3), where it was renamed The Dave, Shelly and Chainsaw Show and aired for three years. Upon returning to KGB-FM in 1997, the show's name was shortened to The DSC. From August 2, 2010 to July 19, 2018, the program was broadcast on KFMB-FM (100.7). Prior to the show's cancellation on \\"100.7 KFM- BFM\\", co-host Shelly Dunn announced her retirement from radio broadcasting. On August 6, 2018, The DSC Show returned to KGB-FM once again with the remainder of the cast. KGB-FM airs The Beatles Radio Show, hosted by Ken Dashow, on Sundays. ==Notable promotionsThe World Famous 101 KGB-FM/San Diego Chicken=== In 1974, KGB introduced the \\"KGB-FM 101 Chicken\\", an advertising mascot played by Ted Giannoulas. Ted then a student at San Diego State University was hired to wear a chicken outfit for a promotion to distribute both 1360 KGB and KGB-FM 101 Easter eggs to children at the San Diego Wild Animal Park. The KGB-FM 101 Chicken whose wacky but fun antics entertained steadily larger crowds, moved on to features at concerts and sporting events, including appearances at more than 520 consecutive San Diego Padres baseball games. Conflict emerged however between the station and Ted and he was dismissed in 1977. Another unnamed employee was hired to take his place, which triggered a lawsuit by Ted. After a court found in his favor in June 1979, Ted was allowed to continue to perform in a chicken costume but though not the same one as the original costume. His return with a brand spanking new name, this time as the San Diego Chicken, was witnessed by 47,000 people at what was called a \\"Grand Hatching\\" event, where he emerged from a Styrofoam egg as the theme from 2001: A Space Odyssey played. Since then, Ted and his alternate ego The Chicken is still truly representing the city of San Diego and 101 KGB-FM to this day. ===Homegrown song contest and albums=== In 1973, KGB-FM created an annual contest called \\"Homegrown\\", in which local singers and songwriters submitted songs about the San Diego area for inclusion on an album produced by the station. The songwriting contest is the brainchild of KGB-FM program director Ron Jacobs, who first held such an event at KHJ (AM) in Los Angeles. The Homegrown album series was introduced in response to the cancellation of the popular \\"Charity Ball\\" event at San Diego Stadium (now Qualcomm Stadium), a venue for which the station was not granted usage in 1973 after holding it the previous year. Proceeds from sale of the albums were donated to local charities. The contest ran through 1978, yielding seven albums named Homegrown through Homegrown VII with copyrights from 1973 to 1979. There were two additional Homegrown albums: Homegrown's Greatest Hits (1978) with favorite selections from previous albums, and Homegrown Songs for '84 with additional songs by San Diego artists about the area. *Homegrown (1973) *Homegrown II (1974) *Homegrown III (1975) *Homegrown IV (1976) *Homegrown V (1977) *Homegrown Greatest Hits (1978) *Homegrown VI (1978) *Homegrown VII (1979) *Homegrown '84 (1983) In 1976, singer Stephen Bishop submitted his song \\"On and On\\", but it was rejected because he submitted it on cassette tape instead of the required reel-to-reel format. The song went on to become a commercial hit. ===Sky Show=== In 1976, KGB-FM launched the annual \\"KGB Sky Show\\" and it has been held continuously ever since. (\\"Sky Show 40\\" was held on September 5, 2015.) The \\"Sky Show\\" is a fireworks display, synchronized to a music soundtrack, broadcast on the radio. This artform was invented by KGB and is now practiced worldwide. The first Sky Show was fired from two locations, Fiesta Island and Chollas Lake. It created traffic jams all over the city as people watched and listened. The firing site was moved to San Diego (Jack Murphy)(Qualcomm) Stadium for reasons of crowd control. The show has become a very well attended annual event with fans viewing from both inside the stadium and outside, tailgating in the parking lot or from vantage points along Mission Valley's canyon rim. The KGB Sky Show also introduced the use of Rock and Roll music, multimedia, video, theatrical lighting and effects to enhance the fireworks display. According to its creator Rick Leibert, Sky Show is \\"continuing experiment blending the ancient art of fireworks with rock and roll\\". The creative team for Sky Show has been collaborating for more than 20 years. Blair Schultze has been Writer/Producer/Director of the KGB Sky Show since 1988, and Ron Dixon has been Fireworks coordinator since 1979 and choreographer since 1990. ==Awards== KGB-FM has garnered several honors throughout its existence. Billboard magazine named KGB-FM its \\"Station of the Year\\" in 1974, and Rolling Stone designated it \\"Rock Station of the Year\\" in 1991. ==References* * * GB-FM Category:Classic rock radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1950 Category:1950 establishments in California Category:IHeartMedia radio stations Category:American radio stations with a three-letter call sign ","title":"KGB-FM"},{"id":"2231204","text":"Jos√© Manuel Carre√±o (born 25 May 1968) is a retired Cuban ballet dancer, who performed as a principal dancer with the English National Ballet, Royal Ballet and American Ballet Theatre.

They are commonly known as shrub frogs, or more ambiguously as \\"moss frogs\\" or \\"bush frogs\\". Some Rhacophoridae are called \\"tree frogs\\". Among the most spectacular members of this family are numerous \\"flying frogs\\". Although a few groups are primarily terrestrial, rhacophorids are predominantly treefrogs which are arboreal. Mating frogs, while in amplexus, hold on to a branch, and beat their legs to form a foam. The eggs are laid in the foam and covered with seminal fluid before the foam hardens into a protective casing. In some species, this is done in a large group. The foam is laid above a water source so the tadpoles fall into the water once they hatch. The species within this family vary in size from . Like other arboreal frogs, they have toe discs, and those of the genus Chiromantis have two opposable fingers on each hand. This family also contains the Old World flying frogs, including Wallace's flying frog (Rhacophorus nigropalmatus). These frogs have extensive webbing between their forelimbs and hindlimbs, allowing them to glide through the air. ==Phylogeny== The following phylogeny of Rhacophoridae is from Yu et al.

He attended local Authority Modern School in Lagere, Ile-lfe. When his father moved to Oduduwa College, Ile-Ife as a laundry man, he gained admission to that school. Dele Giwa travelled to the USA for his higher education, earning a BA in English from Brooklyn College in 1977 and enrolled for a Graduate program at Fordham University. He worked for The New York Times as a news assistant for four years after which he relocated to Nigeria to work with Daily Times. Dele Giwa and fellow journalists Ray Ekpu, Dan Agbese and Yakubu Mohammed founded Newswatch in 1984, and the first edition was distributed on 28 January 1985. A 1989 description of the magazine said it \\"changed the format of print journalism in Nigeria [and] introduced bold, investigative formats to news reporting in Nigeria\\". However, in the first few months of the administration of General Ibrahim Babangida, who took power in August 1985, the magazine was shamelessly flattering. It printed his face on the cover four times and even criticised \\"anyone who attempted to make life unpleasant for Babangida\\". Later, the paper took a more hostile view of the Babangida regime. ==Personal life== Giwa married an American nurse in 1974. His second marriage, to Florence Ita Giwa, lasted 10 months. He later married Olufunmilayo Olaniyan on 10 July 1984, and they were married until his death in 1986. He was survived by his mother, wives and children. ==Assassination== Dele Giwa was killed by a mail bomb in his Lagos home on 19 October 1986. The assassination occurred two days after he had been interviewed by State Security Service (SSS) officials. In an off- the-record interview with airport journalists, Lt. Col. A.K. Togun, the Deputy Director of the SSS had claimed that on 9 October Dele Giwa and Alex Ibru had organised a media parley for media executives and the newly created SSS. Togun claimed that it was at this meeting that the SSS and the media executives reached a secret censorship agreement. Under this agreement, the media was to report any story with potential to embarrass the government to the SSS before they tried to publish same. Giwa had been invited by the SSS to their headquarters for the first time on 19 September 1986 after writing an article in which he described the newly introduced Second-Tier Foreign Exchange Market (SFEM) as \\"God's experiment\\" and suggested that if SFEM failed, the people would will stone their leaders in the streets. Giwa was interviewed and his statement taken by two SSS operatives. He was later taken to meet with Lt Col Togun, the deputy director of the agency in his office. Togun is reported to have told Giwa that he found nothing offensive in the story as Giwa had also stated in the same story that he was hopeful that Babangida seemed determined to make SFEM work. According to Giwa's neighbour and colleague, Ray Ekpu, on 16 October 1986, Giwa had been questioned over the telephone by Col Halilu Akilu of the Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI) over an allegation that Dele had been heard speaking to some people about arms importation. SSS officials reportedly summoned Giwa to their headquarters again on 16 October 1986, and on the next day Ekpu accompanied him to the SSS headquarters for the interview. Lt. Col Togun accused Giwa and Newswatch of planning to write the \\"other side\\" of the story on Ebitu Ukiwe who was removed as Chief of the General staff, to General Babangida. The magazine had published a cover story titled, \\"Power Games: Ukiwe loses out\\", in its edition of 20 October which was on sale on 13 October 1986. Togun also accused Giwa plotting with the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, and students to carry out a socialist revolution. Giwa was also accused of saying that Newswatch would employ the suspended police public relations officer Alozie Ogugbuaja. Ogugbuaja claims that on 16 October 1986, a bomb was defused by the police bomb squad at his official residence in GRA, Ikeja, Lagos. Ogugbuaja also said that he suspected that his phone might have been bugged because Giwa and Ray Ekpu in one of their telephone conversations with him had indeed promised to employ him in Newswatch if the police dismissed him. Ray Ekpu also believed that their houses and phones may have been bugged because he did discuss employing Ogugbuaja in Newswatch with dele Giwa over the phone only; he said that he found two bugging devices in the cover of two books inside his study. Lt. Col. Togun while questioning Giwa had claimed that he wasn't aware of the fact that Akilu had already questioned Giwa over the gun running allegations the day before, this was after Giwa had brought it to his attention. Giwa reported the interrogations to his friend Prince Tony Momoh who was then the Minister of Communications, Giwa had told Momoh that he feared for his life because of the weight of the accusations levelled against him. According to Ekpu, Momoh \\"dismissed it as a joke and said the security men just wanted to rattle him\\"; Momoh promised to look into the matter. On 18 October Giwa also spoke to Admiral Augustus Aikhomu, the Chief of General Staff who said he was familiar with the matter and also promised to look into it. Later on 18 October, a day before the bombing, a staff of the DMI had phoned Giwa's house and asked for his office phone number from his wife Funmi. This same person from the DMI later called back to say he couldn't reach Giwa at the office and then put Col Akilu on the line. Ekpu alleges that Akilu asked Giwa's wife for driving directions to the house and when she asked him why he needed the directions he explained that he wanted to stop by the house on his way to Kano and he wasn't very familiar with Ikeja, he also offered that the President's ADC had something for Giwa, probably an invitation. According to Ekpu this didn't come as a surprise because Giwa had received advance copies of some of the President's speeches in the past through Akilu. On 19 October, Giwa phoned Akilu to ask why he had been calling his house the previous day, Akilu was alleged to have explained that he only wanted to tell Giwa that the matter had been resolved. Ekpu says Giwa replied Akilu that it wasn't over and that he had already informed his lawyer, Chief Gani Fawehinmi to follow up on the matter. Akilu then told Giwa that there was no need for that, that it wasn't a matter for lawyers and that he should consider the matter resolved. About 40 minutes after the telephone conversation with Akilu, a package was delivered to Giwa's guard (the accounts of which vehicle was used to deliver the package vary). When Giwa received the package, he was with Kayode Soyinka (London Bureau Chief of Newswatch). The package exploded, mortally wounded Giwa and temporarily deafening Soyinka, who had excused himself to the rest room shortly before Giwa was supposed to have attempted opening the package. Giwa was rushed to the hospital where he eventually died from his wounds. ==Investigation, Litigation and Controversy== On twenty October, the day after the bombing, the government convened a press conference presided over by Augustus Aikhomu. Before the press conference started, all press photographers, foreign journalists, and Nigerians that worked for foreign news media were ordered out. Those left behind were told that the briefing was \\"off the record\\" and Aikhomu would not be entertaining any questions. Aikhomu then went on to ask Ismaila Gwarzo, the Director of the SSS and Haliru Akilu to render their accounts of what had transpired between Dele Giwa and their agencies in the recent past. Gwarzo confirmed that the SSS had invited Giwa for questioning over allegations of gun running. Akilu on his part confirmed that he had called Giwa's home on 18 October to ask for directions to the house so he could stop over to see Giwa while on his way to Kano through Ikeja airport. Akilu also said that he had wanted to visit Giwa at home to \\"prove a Hausa adage that if you visit someone in his house, you show him you are really a friend.\\" Ekpu claimed that he remembered Gwarzo saying that the killing was \\"quite embarrassing\\" and also that Tony Momoh had described it as \\"a clear case of assassination\\"; later he was quoted saying, \\"a special probe would serve no useful purpose\\". Graffiti of the time implied a belief that the SSS had been responsible. In a newspaper interview years later in retirement, Chris Omeben who at the time was the Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) in charge of the Federal Investigation and Intelligence Bureau (FIIB) at Alagbon, on his part recalled that he was the second officer to have handled the case file after he had taken it over from his predecessor at the FIIB, Victor Pam. Omeben explained that he had done what any competent investigator would have done in unraveling the circumstances surrounding the death of Dele Giwa. He went on to say that he had examined the crime scene and found it suspicious that the toilet adjacent to the blast site which Kayode Soyinka alleged he was occupying when the explosion occurred had also suffered damage from the blast but Soyinka was left unscathed. Omeben described the force of the explosion to have been strong enough to blow out the steel bars over the toilet window (burglary protection), which in his own assessment made Soyinka's story less convincing. Omeben also claims he requested to interview Dan Agbese, Ray Ekpu and Kayode Soyinka. Of the three, only Agbese turned up, he was later to find out that Soyinka had fled the country. Omeben also recalled that in the course of his investigations he had cause to interrogate both Haliru Akilu and Tunde Togun. According to Omeben Akilu defended Giwa's invitation to the DMI by saying Giwa was invited to clarify statements he made to a New York daily which had been assessed as having potential to paint the country in a bad light in the international press. The only known interview Giwa gave to any New York daily was one published eight months earlier in a New York Times story about rising religious nationalism and extremism in Nigeria. On the issue of rising Islamic nationalism, Giwa gave this singular quote in the story, It's a dangerous, explosive trend,...in the worst case, I see a situation where die-hard Christians and die-hard Moslems are fighting in the streets. Omeben said he was satisfied with the reasons Akilu and Togun gave for inviting Giwa. However, Soyinka has come out to reply Omeben and accused him of spreading deliberate falsehood with his comments on him on his involvement with the parcel bomb incident. In an interview he granted The Nation newspaper of Lagos of Saturday, 19 January 2013, Soyinka strongly denied that he ran to the toilet when the bomb exploded. He said he did not know where Omeben got that false information from. When questioned, Soyinka requested to not be required to relive the experience again. Omeben also alleged that he was being pressured into naming Babangida and Akilu as suspects when he yet had no evidence linking them to the crime. Some of this pressure led to the formation of a special squad to investigate the case, the squad was headed by Assistant Commissioner of Police Abubakar Tsav. Omeben alleges that the then Inspector General of Police Gambo Jimeta has asked him to leave the case with the Tsav team out of anger at how messy the whole situation was getting. Omeben also spoke about certain \\"fixations\\" in the minds of the general public about the case, in his own words \\"...There is the tendency for people to make up their minds as to what they want to see or hear. It may not necessarily be the truth and once they are so fixated, every other thing that somebody else would say would not mean anything to them. Dele Giwa's case suffered such a fixation\\". In testimony that he gave on 3 July 2001 before the Justice Oputa led Human Rights Violations Investigations Commission (HRVIC), Tsav alleged that the government stonewalled his investigation into the assassination. Tsav claimed that he was not granted permission to question key actors involved, including Tunde Togun, Ismaila Gwarzo and Haliru Akilu. He also said that he had requested that the privileges of these officers be withdrawn so he could take their statements and conduct a search of their offices and residences for items of evidential value but this request was denied. Tsav averred that in his final report, he had concluded that there was enough circumstantial evidence to accuse the duo of Togun and Akilu of conspiracy to murder but still the government did not make these two officers available for interrogation or a voice identification as he had requested. Tsav claims that he handed the case file back to Chris Omeben. Tsav alleged that none of his recommendations were implemented, the case file was never returned to him and that there was no evidence that the case was transferred to another officer or agency. Tsav said he believed Giwa was killed because he believed Giwa was in \\"the way of some powerful forces\\". After the investigation stalled, various conspiracy theories arose to explain why Giwa was killed. One of the most popular and still the most enduring has been the Gloria Okon connection. Gloria Okon was a Lady who was arrested in 1985 at the Aminu Kano International airport on suspicion of drug smuggling. Soon after, the it was alleged that she had died in custody, the government subsequently constituted a commission of inquiry to investigate the matter. Conspiracy theorists allege that Gloria Okon was a drug mule working for the wife of General Ibrahim Babangida who was then the Minister of Defence in the regime of General Muhammadu Buhari. The theorists allege that during interrogation Okon had claimed that she worked for highly placed Nigerians, in particular Babangida's wife. The theory goes on that Babangida spirited Okon out of detention to the United Kingdom, sold the public the ruse of a dead Gloria Okon and that Dele Giwa happened upon Okon on a trip to the UK where she told him her story. The story goes on that armed with this information, Giwa tried to blackmail the now Military President, Ibrahim Babangida and this was why he was killed. This blackmail theory might not be unconnected with the off-the-record interview that Lt Col A.K Togun gave to airport correspondents of the Guardian on 27 October 1986. In the interview, when asked about Dele Giwa's killing and the suspicion in the public that he was killed by the government, Togun was quoted as saying \\"...one person cannot come out to blackmail us. I am an expert in blackmail. I can blackmail very well. I studied propaganda so no one person can come and blackmail us after an agreement...\\". Togun's statement was in the context of the secret agreement reached by Giwa and other media executives at the 9 October meeting, he seemed to accuse Giwa of reneging on the agreement leading to Giwa being invited for questioning on 16 October. Theorists also allege that Babangida's drug running activities were brought to the attention of the Buhari-Idiagbon regime which led the regime to slate him for retirement on 1 October 1985. They also say that it was his impending retirement that inspired him to plan the coup that toppled Buhari in August 1985. Giwa's colleagues at Newswatch have debunked this theory and deny any link between Giwa, Gloria Okon and Mrs. Babangida. In a Newswatch interview marking the twenty fifth anniversary of the magazine, one of the founding partners of the organisation Yakubu Mohammed explained the Giwa-Newswatch-Gloria Okon link. Mohammed claims that Dele Giwa had not been writing any Gloria Okon story and that the closest Newswatch got to a Gloria Okon story was at one of the magazine's editorial conferences where a Newswatch reporter, Bose lasaki, who was a niece to President Olusegun Obasanjo spoke about a \\"rumour\\" making the rounds to the effect that Gloria Okon had not died in detention but had been spirited out of the country. Mohammed claimed that Lasaki's story was dismissed off-hand but that she was asked to find out more about the rumour. Lasaki was alleged to have returned for the next editorial conference the following week and declared that there was no substance to the rumour. Mohammed alleged that Giwa was not at any of these meetings. The Ibrahim Babangida drug running angle was also called into question by revelations made by the embittered former head of the National Security Organization (NSO), Alhaji Mohammed Lawal Rafindadi. In 1985, following a request by the Supreme Military Council, the NSO under Rafindadi investigated Babangida and found him complicit of forgery and activities inimical to national security. This issue arose as a result of Babangida and his in-law, Mr Sunny Okogwu's interest in an arms manufacturing venture in Kaduna called Black Gold. The SMC, based on the NSO's findings slated Babangida for retirement. The only witness to the events shortly before the bomb exploded, Mr Kayode Soyinka had alleged that the package had a label with the seal of the Nigerian President and also claimed that the label indicated that it was from the office of the president. However, no other witness has corroborated this claim, Giwa's 17-year-old son, Billy, who had delivered the package to Giwa has never corroborated this claim. Soyinka's testimony about the events prior to and after the bombing have also been brought into question, there have been accusations made to the effect that he might have been the same person that detonated the bomb by remote control as he was not injured in the explosion. Soyinka is also alleged to have given conflicting accounts of the events to the Police and media outlets, he is also accused of fleeing the country while investigations were ongoing. To the accusation of fleeing the country, Soyinka has this to say in that his interview with The Nation (Saturday, 19 January 2013): \\"Dele was very close to his mother. He did not joke with her at all. It was an honour for me to have met her. The last time I saw her was at Dele's burial in their village near Auchi, in Edo State. I was there live with my wife contrary to the erroneous story of Babangida's government's mischief makers who tried to deceive the Nigerian people in order to exonerate the government from the assassination of Dele Giwa, saying that I had fled the country. They deliberately spread all kinds of falsehood, ignoring even newspaper reports and pictures of myself and my wife in attendance at the burial. And mind you, how could I have fled the country? My wife and children were not in Nigeria with me when the bomb exploded, they had to take the next available flight to Nigeria to join me. Yet, Babangida's men said I fled the country. And my family and I remained in the country throughout the whole period of the controversy and burial arrangement. We returned to London together through the former British Caledonian Airways, through Muritala Mohammed Airport. There was no way we could have left quietly. We were accompanied to and seen off at the airport by friends, including the Newswatch editors, and family. The airline people recognised us. Our two children were still small then. The air hostesses took them from us, played with them, and they were asking me if I was feeling better ‚Äì knowing the trauma one must have been through in the past weeks, and took us straight and right inside the aircraft, even before checking in other passengers. Yet the Babangida men kept saying, even till today, that I fled the country. Can you imagine?\\" Giwa's lawyer was also accused of prematurely accusing the government of Dele Giwa's murder thereby truncating the investigation into the case, Newswatch magazine in an edition of 5 November 1986 disowned Fawehimni. The subsequent court cases instituted by Fawehinmi against the government to enable him try the case as a private prosecutor after the Director of Public Prosecution, Mrs. Eniola Fadayomi had refused to prosecute based on the evidence available were mostly unsuccessful. An excerpt of the Judgement by the then Lagos State Chief Judge, Justice Candido Johnson reads thus \\"...Even if one considers the reasonableness of time, I would say that the incident that gave birth to the death of the late Dele Giwa is not only unique in its form but also complex and would require sufficient time to conduct detailed and balanced investigation, a report on which the appropriate authority would reasonably act. The timing here appears hasty and premature. It appears impulsive without giving reasonable time and chance for a detailed and balanced investigation into this sordid incident. In the circumstances and having regard to the review made above, it is my ruling that this (ex-parte) application is misconceived and it is therefore dismissed. Leave to apply for mandamus is hereby refused.\\" Fawehinmi went on to the Supreme Court and got a favourable judgement which enabled him go back to the Lagos State High Court, this judgement also mandated the Justice Candido to recuse himself from the case and appoint another judge to hear the case. On 23 February 1988, Justice Longe ruled that the two security officers, Lt. Col Tunde Togun and Col. Haliru Akilu could not be tried for the murder of Dele Giwa. In his ruling Justice Longe averred among other things that,\\"...the Attorney general did not oppose the objection raised by counsel to the 'accused' persons, Chief Rotimi Williams, on the ground that the information was filed by private prosecutor (Chief Gani Fawehinmi) when the information had not been completed and especially when the 'INFORMATION IMPLICATED ONE OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES'(Kayode Soyinka)...the proof of evidence before the Court was mere HEARSAY‚Ä¶. Based on the evidence available before the court, it will be an abuse of the process of court to call the two security chiefs for trial. The information is therefore quashed accordingly.\\" Kayode Soyinka was represented in court by Kayode Sofola SAN, representing the chambers of Kehinde Sofola SAN, that succeeded to getting the court to rule as frivolous the reference to Soyinka being \\"implicated\\". The court also ordered that cost be paid Soyinka by the 'accused' persons. In 2001, General Ibrahim Babangida refused to testify before a national human rights commission about the Giwa murder. Babangida, Hakilu and Togun went to court and obtained an order restraining the commission from summoning them to appear before it. The Chairman of the commission commented that the commission had the power to issue arrest warrants for the trio but decided against this \\"in the over-all interest of national reconciliation\\". In 2008, the Government of Nigeria named a street in the New Federal Capital Abuja after Dele Giwa, as they did with other activists such as Fela Anikulapo-Kuti and Ken Saro Wiwa ==See also== *List of unsolved murders ==ReferencesNotes=== * Ugochukwu Ejinkeonye. \\"Remembering Dele Giwa\\" Thisday Newspaper, AllAfrica.com, 19 October 2001 Category:1947 births Category:1980s murders in Nigeria Category:1986 crimes in Nigeria Category:1986 deaths Category:1986 murders in Africa Category:20th- century Nigerian writers Category:Assassinated Nigerian journalists Category:Brooklyn College alumni Category:Burials in Edo State Category:Deaths by letter bomb Category:Fordham University alumni Category:Nigerian editors Category:Nigerian expatriates in the United States Category:Nigerian magazine founders Category:Nigerian murder victims Category:Nigerian newspaper journalists Category:People from Ife Category:People murdered in Lagos Category:Unsolved murders in Nigeria Category:Yoruba journalists ","title":"Dele Giwa"},{"id":"2231230","text":"Return to Flight can refer to: * Apollo 7, NASA's first mission after the Apollo 1 fire * Falcon 9 Flight 20 * Space Shuttle mission STS-26, NASA's first mission after the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster * Space Shuttle mission STS-114, NASA's first test mission after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster * Space Shuttle mission STS-121, NASA's second test mission following the Columbia disaster * ISRO's successful launch of GSLV-D5 with indigenously developed CE-7.5 cryogenic rocket engine ","title":"Return to Flight"},{"id":"2231241","text":"The Lorraine City Council (in French: Conseil municipal de la Ville de Lorraine) is the governing body of the mayor‚Äìcouncil government in the city of Lorraine, Quebec, Canada. The city and its council were established on February 4, 1960 by means of Private Bill 125 of the Twenty-Fifth Legislature of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec (now National Assembly of Quebec). Since June 1962, regular sittings are held once a month at the Garth House, 100 Grande Cote, Lorraine, Quebec. The agenda for each meeting is not published in advance resulting in low citizen attendance. ==Formation and Pre-Elective History== The bill stated that the first aldermen were to be: * Luc Larose, professional engineer, of Sainte-Th√©r√®se * Germain Laplante, workman, of the parish of Sainte-Th√©r√®se-de-Blainville * J. Andr√© Laferri√®re, land surveyor, of Montreal * Peter McKenzie, financier, of Pointe-Claire * Gerald M. Barlow, manager, of Montreal * Donald Kirk, professional engineer, of Westmount * John J. Seguier, gentleman, of Montreal. The first sitting of the Council occurred on May 9, 1960; John J. Seguier was named mayor by the aldermen, as the law provided. At the same time Luc Larose resigned and was immediately replaced by Edward Whittingham, manager, of Montreal West. On November 13, 1963, alderman Germain Laplante resigned and was immediately replaced by J. Albert Cl√©ment, engineer. On November 18, 1964, alderman Gerald M. Barlow resigned; on December 12, Peter McKenzie resigned. They were replaced that day by aldermen J. C. Sarault and Arthur E. Ainger, both of Lorraine. ==Elected Body== Although Bill 125 indicated an election would occur on the first Monday of February 1965, provisions were made to extend the deadline for up to two years upon petition by the majority of the land-owners (per area). Such petition was approved and sent to the Provincial Government by the Council on October 21, 1964; the first election thus occurred on January 25, 1967. In the meantime, the Cities and Towns Act was modified so that alderman seats would have to be numbered. Each alderman was thus attributed a numbered seat on December 14, 1966. {  border=\\"1\\" !Election !! Mayor !! Seat no 1 !!

Sullivan, in the late 19th century, there have been world champions in professional boxing. The first of the current organizations to award a world title was the World Boxing Association (WBA), then known as the National Boxing Association (NBA), when it sanctioned its first title fight in 1921 between Jack Dempsey and Georges Carpentier for the world heavyweight championship. There are now four major sanctioning bodies in professional boxing. The official rules and regulations of the World Boxing Association (WBA), World Boxing Council (WBC), International Boxing Federation (IBF), and World Boxing Organization (WBO) all recognize each other in their rankings and title unification rules. Each of these organizations sanction and regulate championship bouts and award world titles. American boxing magazine The Ring began awarding world titles in 1922. There are seventeen weight divisions. To compete in a division, a boxer's weight must not exceed the upper limit. Manny Pacquiao has won world championships in eight weight divisions, more than any other boxer, and is the only one in boxing history to achieve it. The Klitschko brothers, Vitali and Wladimir, held all four major titles in the heavyweight division from 2011 to 2013; they were the first brothers to hold versions of the heavyweight championship at the same time. Joe Louis holds the record of being the longest reigning world champion in boxing.Longest reigning boxing world champion ==Championships== When a champion, for reasons beyond his control such as an illness or injury, is unable to defend his title within the normal mandatory time, the sanctioning bodies may order an interim title bout and award the winner an interim championship. The WBA and WBC have often changed the status of their inactive champions to a \\"Champion in Recess\\" or \\"Champion Emeritus\\". ===World Boxing Association=== The World Boxing Association (WBA) was founded in 1921 as the National Boxing Association (NBA), a national regulating body of the United States. On August 23, 1962, the NBA became the WBA, which today has its head office in Panama. According to WBA championship rules, when a champion also holds a title of one of the other three major sanctioning bodies in an equivalent weight division, that boxer is granted a special recognition of \\"Unified Champion\\", and is given more time between mandatory title defences. The WBA Championships Committee and President may also designate a champion as a \\"Super Champion\\" or \\"Undisputed Champion\\" in exceptional circumstances; the standard WBA title is then vacated and contested between WBA-ranked contenders. When a WBA \\"Regular Champion\\" makes between five and ten successful defences, he may be granted the WBA \\"Super\\" title upon discretion of a vote of the WBA's board of governors. ===World Boxing Council=== The World Boxing Council (WBC) was founded in Mexico City, Mexico on February 14, 1963 in order to establish an international regulating body. The WBC established many of today's safety measures in boxing, such as the standing eight count, a limit of 12 rounds instead of 15, and additional weight divisions. More information about the WBC's other titles including \\"Silver\\", \\"Diamond\\", \\"Emeritus\\", \\"Franchise\\", \\"Honorary\\", and \\"Supreme Champion\\" can be read at the WBC article. ===International Boxing Federation=== The International Boxing Federation (IBF) originated in September 1976 as the United States Boxing Association (USBA) when American members of the WBA withdrew in order to legitimize boxing in the United States with \\"unbiased\\" ratings. In April 1983, the organization established an international division that was known as the United States Boxing Association-International (USBA-I). In May 1984, the New Jersey-based USBA-I was renamed and became the IBF. ===World Boxing Organization=== The World Boxing Organization (WBO) was founded in San Juan, Puerto Rico (which is a self-governing commonwealth of the United States) in 1988. In its early years the WBO's titles were not widely recognized. By 2012 when the Japan Boxing Commission officially recognized the governing body, it had gained similar status to the other three major sanctioning bodies. Its motto is \\"dignity, democracy, honesty.\\" When a WBO champion has reached \\"preeminent status\\", the WBO's Executive Committee may designate him as a \\"Super Champion\\". However, this is only an honorary title and not the same as the WBA's policy of having separate \\"Super\\" and \\"Regular\\" champions. A WBO \\"Super Champion\\" cannot win or lose that recognition in the ring; it is merely awarded by the WBO. ===The Ring=== The boxing magazine The Ring awards its own belts. The original title sequence began from the magazine's first publication in the 1920s until its titles were placed on hiatus in 1989, continuing as late as 1992 in some divisions. When The Ring started awarding titles again in 2001, it did not calculate retrospective lineages to fill in the gap years, instead nominating a new champion. Cyber Boxing Zone commented in 2004 that \\"The Ring has forfeited its credibility by pulling names out of its ass to name fighters as champions\\". In 2007, The Ring was acquired by the owners of fight promoter Golden Boy Promotions, which has publicized The Ring's world championships when they are at stake in fights it promotes (such as Joe Calzaghe vs. Roy Jones Jr. in 2008). Since 2012, to reduce the number of vacant titles, The Ring allows fights between a number one or two contender; or alternatively a number three, four, or five contender to fill a vacant title. This has prompted further doubts about its credibility.The Horrible New Ring Magazine Championship Policy - Queensberry Rules Some boxing journalists have been extremely critical of the new championship policy and state that if this new policy is followed, the Ring title will lose the credibility it once held. ==Current champions== The current champions in each weight division are listed below. Each champion's professional boxing record is shown in the following format: wins‚Äìlosses‚Äìdraws (knockout wins). ===Heavyweight (200+ lb/90.7+ kg)===  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Anthony Joshua 23‚Äì1 (21 KO) December 7, 2019  rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Tyson Fury 30‚Äì0‚Äì1 (21 KO) February 22, 2020  rowspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Anthony Joshua 23‚Äì1 (21 KO) December 7, 2019  rowspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Anthony Joshua 23‚Äì1 (21 KO) December 7, 2019  rowspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Tyson Fury 30‚Äì0‚Äì1 (21 KO) February 22, 2020 -

DCL (Oxon.) is a fictional character in the 1980s British sitcom Yes Minister and its sequel, Yes, Prime Minister. He is the Minister of the (fictional) Department of Administrative Affairs, and later the Prime Minister. He was portrayed by Paul Eddington in the original show; in the 2013 revival he was portrayed by David Haig. ==Fictional biography== Hacker was an academic political researcher, polytechnic lecturer, and editor of a newspaper, Reform, and entered Parliament circa 1961. He continued with at least some of these jobs while holding the office of Member of Parliament for Birmingham East. For the first twenty years of his political career, Hacker was a member of the Opposition, and he served as Shadow Minister of Agriculture from 1974 on. In 1980, he served as the head of the unsuccessful party leadership campaign of Martin Walker; the winner of this campaign, Herbert Attwell, later went on to win the general election in 1981, and thereby became the UK's new prime minister. Hacker was nervous that Attwell would pass him over for a Cabinet post as an act of revenge for running Walker's campaign against him, but Attwell appointed Hacker to the cabinet as minister for the (fictitious) Department of Administrative Affairs. At least one news commentator of the time speculated that the appointment was actually an act of revenge, as the DAA had a reputation as \\"a political graveyard\\" that could end Hacker's career. In Yes Minister, Hacker is joined by the ministry's Permanent Secretary, Sir Humphrey Appleby, who as a senior civil servant tries to control the ministry and the minister himself, and also by his Principal Private Secretary, Bernard Woolley. Hacker received his degree, a third, from the London School of Economics, and is frequently derided for this by the Oxford-educated Sir Humphrey. He and his wife, Annie, have one daughter, Lucy, a sociology student at the University of Sussex who plays a major role in the first series episode \\"The Right to Know\\". (In a later episode it's hinted they also have another child.) Hacker gains an honorary doctorate from Baillie College, Oxford (a possible reference to Balliol College), in the second series episode \\"Doing the Honours\\". During the Christmas special episode, \\"Party Games\\", he is Party Chair, which gives him the opportunity ‚Äì with the help of Sir Humphrey and other civil servants acting in their own interests ‚Äì to become Prime Minister in an episode broadcast in 1985 (but according to the book adaptation, set in 1984). Yes, Prime Minister follows on from this, with Hacker and Sir Humphrey raised to the highest levels in British government: Prime Minister and Cabinet Secretary respectively. Bernard remains Hacker's principal private secretary throughout. An obituary for Hacker, written by his creators, Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn, appears in Politico's Book of the Dead. The entry gives Hacker the same dates of birth and death as Paul Eddington, the actor who portrayed him. (These dates make Hacker 53 at the time of broadcast of the episode \\"Open Government\\", although this episode states that he is in his late forties.) Although the series itself ends with Hacker still Prime Minister, this obituary mentions his later career as a member of the House of Lords. After his death, a college is named after him (Hacker College, Oxford). == Character == Jim Hacker first appears in Yes Minister having been recently re-elected as Member of Parliament for Birmingham East, soundly defeating his opponents. His early character is that of a very gung-ho, albeit naive, politician, ready to bring sweeping change into his department, unaware that Sir Humphrey and the civil service are out to stop any semblance of change, despite their insistence that they are his allies. Hacker is also noted as having challenged Humphrey while he was a member of the Opposition by asking difficult questions when Sir Humphrey was testifying to a Parliamentary committee: Sir Humphrey stated that Hacker had asked \\"...all the questions I hoped nobody would ask,\\" showing his new Minister to be at least a reasonably capable politician. Before long, Hacker begins to notice that the Civil Service has been preventing any of his changes from actually being put into practice. Bernard is sympathetic to Hacker's plight and tries to enlighten his Minister as to the tricks and techniques employed by government staff, but his ability to help is limited by his own loyalties in the Civil Service. Hacker soon learns and becomes more sly and cynical, using some of these ploys himself. While Sir Humphrey nearly always gets the upper hand, Hacker now and again plays a trump card, and on even fewer occasions, the two of them work towards a common goal. Hacker also learns that his efforts to change the government or Britain are all really for naught, as he discovers in the episode \\"The Whisky Priest\\", when he attempts to stop the export of British-made munitions to Italian terrorists. Throughout Yes Minister, there are many occasions when Hacker is portrayed as a publicity-mad bungler, incapable of making a firm decision, and prone to blunders that embarrass him or his party, eliciting bad press and stern lectures from the party apparatus, particularly the Chief Whip. He is continually concerned with what the newspapers of the day will have to say about him, and is always hoping to be promoted by the Prime Minister. (Hacker ran the unsuccessful campaign for a political ally during the party's last leadership election ‚Äì his man lost, becoming Foreign Secretary, and leaving Hacker nervous about his prospects under the winner, now Prime Minister.) He is equally afraid of either staying at his current level of Cabinet seniority, or being demoted. Just prior to the start of Yes, Prime Minister, Hacker shows a zeal for making speeches and presents himself as a viable party leader after the Prime Minister announces his resignation in the episode \\"Party Games\\". He is given embarrassing information about the two front-runner candidates, and manages to persuade them (by insinuating that secret information pertaining to both may be revealed to the public) to drop out of the race, and lend their support to him. With help from the recently promoted Sir Humphrey and other senior civil servants, Hacker emerges as a compromise candidate and becomes head of his party unopposed ‚Äì and Prime Minister. In Yes, Prime Minister Hacker strives to perfect all the skills needed by a statesman, giving more grandiose speeches, dreaming up \\"courageous\\" political programmes, and honing his diplomatic craft, nearly all of these attempts landing him in trouble at some point. In a Radio Times interview to promote the latter series, Paul Eddington stated, \\"He's beginning to find his feet as a man of power, and he's begun to confound those who thought they'd be able to manipulate him out of hand.\\"Radio Times: 4‚Äì10 January 1986 Hacker becomes a more competent politician by the end. Though primarily interested in his personal career survival and advancement, he, unlike Sir Humphrey, views government as a means rather than an end in itself. == Interests and habits == Hacker has many prominent habits that feature throughout the series: * Drinking. Hacker enjoys various alcoholic beverages, particularly harder liquors, including Scotch whisky: \\"the odd drinkie\\", as he likes to call them. He is seen drunk on more than one occasion and was caught drinking and driving in the episode \\"Party Games\\". He used his political immunity to escape charges. He even went as far as to smuggle alcohol into a diplomatic function in Qumran (a dry Islamic oil sheikhdom) by establishing a false diplomatic communications room in The Moral Dimension. * Disdain for certain types of culture. Sir Humphrey thinks Hacker to be a cultural philistine who is unaware of the importance of protecting Britain's artistic heritage. Hacker believes it only important to the upper- class snobs (such as Humphrey himself), and several other \\"wet, long-haired, scruffy art lovers\\", arguing that operas created by Italians and Germans are not representative of Britain's cultural heritage. However, upon becoming Minister for the Arts (in \\"The Middle-Class Rip-Off\\"), Hacker asks Humphrey if he could tag along on a gala night at the Royal Opera House. Humphrey is delighted by the volte-face and declares, \\"Yes, Minister\\" enthusiastically. But Hacker and his wife enjoy seeing foreign films, and in the same episode Hacker demonstrates some grasp of art, enough to make a strong case that a disputed art gallery in his constituency is not worth saving. (See also \\"Football\\" below.) * Pomposity. Hacker is often seen going off into sentimental, overly pretentious speeches either to himself or to Bernard and Sir Humphrey, holding his lapel on his suit jacket in a very royal manner. He also mimicked Napoleon by slipping his hand in the front of his suit jacket upon hearing he was selected by the party to become party leader and hence Prime Minister. However, it appears that Hacker's political idol is Winston Churchill: he occasionally speaks in the statesman's gruff style, on several occasions imitating or paraphrasing Churchill's \\"We shall fight on the beaches\\" speech, and is seen reading biographies of him. * Football. Hacker believes that sport is of great cultural importance and is even willing to sacrifice a local art gallery in order to bail out his constituency's football team, the fictional Aston Wanderers, that was being threatened with bankruptcy. He didn't support the team though, and was mentioned as being an Aston Villa supporter in the first episode. == Political affiliation == Hacker's political party is never explicitly stated ‚Äì a deliberate ploy by the series' creators to prevent the show from having a partisan affiliation. This begins in the very first scene of the 'Yes Minister' pilot episode, where the victorious Hacker's party rosette is white, as opposed to the red (for Labour) and blue (for the Conservatives) rosettes worn by the other candidates. The Labour and Conservative parties are eventually compared in The National Education Service, when Sir Humphrey tells Bernard, \\"When there is a Labour government, the education authorities tell them that comprehensives abolish the class system and when there's a Tory government we tell them that it's the cheapest way of providing mass education; to Labour we explain that selective education is divisive and to the Tories we explain that it is expensive.\\" but Sir Humphrey then goes on to tell Hacker neither of these things, forgoing any suggestion that Hacker is from either party. Throughout the show, Hacker's political opinions tend towards reform of administration and are neither left nor right wing. However, the concentration on \\"making budget cuts (of 5%)\\" in the Yes Minister episode \\"Doing the Honours\\" and cutting taxes in the Yes Prime Minister episode \\"The Smoke Screen\\" allude towards him being a conservative; and the writers have since established that they privately saw Hacker as a centrist \\"wet\\" Conservative. == Other media == In a radio broadcast spoof of Yes Minister performed by both Eddington and Nigel Hawthorne, both of whom played their respective parts from the show, Hacker is a Minister in the government of the day, that of Margaret Thatcher, who also played herself as Prime Minister. In the sketch, she asks that Hacker and Sir Humphrey abolish economists. In the 2010 stage production of Yes, Prime Minister, the role was played by David Haig; Graham Seed took the role in a touring production of the play. == References == Category:Yes Minister characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1980 Category:Fictional Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom ","title":"Jim Hacker"},{"id":"2231270","text":"Brigit Forsyth (born 28 July 1940 in Edinburgh) is a Scottish actress, best known for her roles as Thelma Ferris in the BBC comedy Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? and Helen Yeldham in the ITV drama Boon.

The EP received a mixed-to-favorable response from music critics. == Title and theme == The EP's title reflects frontman Jason Lytle's frustration with his hometown, Modesto, California, and has been described as \\"not so much a farewell as a fuck off to the town\\". The name comes from something Lytle saw on the vanity license plate of a large truck in Modesto. In Lytle's words, the EP \\"was a nice opportunity for me to produce some whiney little complaining songs about my hometown. I think it's pretty blatant; it's pretty stripped down in terms of the message.\\" It was recorded simultaneously with Just Like the Fambly Cat, and Lytle planned to leave Modesto as soon as the album was complete, stating \\"In Modesto, it's like gravity is a lot heavier. There's something that just makes you feel like you're doing all you can just to keep your head above water, when in fact there's not a whole lot going on.\\" He recorded the EP as \\"a way to fill the gaps of time while recording the new album. I just thought I could throw together some old songs and some newer ones and a really new one\\". == Recording == Todd Zilla was recorded on 8-track equipment at one of Lytle's two home studios. Its eight tracks do not appear on the band's fourth full- length album, Just Like the Fambly Cat. Some of the songs had been written much earlier, as far back as ten years before, as Lytle stated: \\"There are years-long gaps between a lot of these songs, and mostly they were just annoying me because they were sitting around doing nothing.\\" Everything on the EP was written and recorded by Lytle with the exception of drum tracks by Aaron Burtch. == Release == Excerpts from the Diary of Todd Zilla was released on September 27, 2005 by record label V2. A limited-pressing vinyl edition was released by record label Devil in the Woods, containing the bonus track \\"Hidden Health Announcement\\". == Reception == Excerpts from the Diary of Todd Zilla received mixed-to-favorable reviews from critics. Marc Hogan of Pitchfork gave it 5.6/10, calling it \\"a goofy, sloppy mini-album, cramming familiar Weezer fuzz, stoned piano ballads, playful analogue synths, and misguided Bad Company references into a little more than half an hour\\". Gareth Dobson of Drowned in Sound gave it five out of ten, calling it a \\"mixed bag\\". SPIN gave it a B+ rating, calling it \\"richly illustrated, grim but empathetic, epic yet humane art rock\\". In the view of Joey Lipps of The Michigan Daily, \\"it falls short of the captivating quality of their previous recordings\\".

In particular, a universally measurable set of reals is necessarily Lebesgue measurable (see below). Every analytic set is universally measurable. It follows from projective determinacy, which in turn follows from sufficient large cardinals, that every projective set is universally measurable. ==Finiteness condition== The condition that the measure be a probability measure; that is, that the measure of X itself be 1, is less restrictive than it may appear. For example, Lebesgue measure on the reals is not a probability measure, yet every universally measurable set is Lebesgue measurable. To see this, divide the real line into countably many intervals of length 1; say, N0=[0,1), N1=[1,2), N2=[-1,0), N3=[2,3), N4=[-2,-1), and so on. Now letting Œº be Lebesgue measure, define a new measure ŒΩ by : u(A)=\\\\sum_{i=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\\\\mu(A\\\\cap N_i) Then easily ŒΩ is a probability measure on the reals, and a set is ŒΩ-measurable if and only if it is Lebesgue measurable. More generally a universally measurable set must be measurable with respect to every sigma-finite measure that measures all Borel sets. == Example contrasting with Lebesgue measurability == Suppose A is a subset of Cantor space 2^\\\\omega; that is, A is a set of infinite sequences of zeroes and ones. By putting a binary point before such a sequence, the sequence can be viewed as a real number between 0 and 1 (inclusive), with some unimportant ambiguity. Thus we can think of A as a subset of the interval [0,1], and evaluate its Lebesgue measure, if that is defined. That value is sometimes called the coin-flipping measure of A, because it is the probability of producing a sequence of heads and tails that is an element of A upon flipping a fair coin infinitely many times. Now it follows from the axiom of choice that there are some such A without a well-defined Lebesgue measure (or coin-flipping measure). That is, for such an A, the probability that the sequence of flips of a fair coin will wind up in A is not well-defined. This is a pathological property of A that says that A is \\"very complicated\\" or \\"ill-behaved\\". From such a set A, form a new set A' by performing the following operation on each sequence in A: Intersperse a 0 at every even position in the sequence, moving the other bits to make room. Although A' is not intuitively any \\"simpler\\" or \\"better-behaved\\" than A, the probability that the sequence of flips of a fair coin will be in A' is well-defined. Indeed, to be in A', the coin must come up tails on every even-numbered flip, which happens with probability zero. However A' is not universally measurable. To see that, we can test it against a biased coin that always comes up tails on even-numbered flips, and is fair on odd-numbered flips. For a set of sequences to be universally measurable, an arbitrarily biased coin may be used (even one that can \\"remember\\" the sequence of flips that has gone before) and the probability that the sequence of its flips ends up in the set must be well- defined. However, when A' is tested by the coin we mentioned (the one that always comes up tails on even-numbered flips, and is fair on odd-numbered flips), the probability to hit A' is not well defined (for the same reason why A cannot be tested by the fair coin). Thus, A' is not universally measurable. == References == * * Category:Descriptive set theory Category:Determinacy Category:Measure theory ","title":"Universally measurable set"},{"id":"2231308","text":"William Ricketts William Ricketts (1898‚Äì1993) was an Australian potter and sculptor of the arts and crafts movement. Born in Richmond, Victoria, in 1898, William settled permanently in Mount Dandenong, Victoria, in 1934. Although not trained as a potter and never technically superior (his works, large and small, frequently exhibit cracking), the power of his vision of a modern Australia that embraces Aboriginal spirituality and respect for the natural world was his general message throughout his artworks. His major works include the \\"Dromana\\" in the Seawinds Garden, Arthurs Seat, Victoria, and \\"Gun Brute\\" at the William Ricketts Sanctuary, Mount Dandenong, Victoria. Many smaller works are in the collection of the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney. Photographic records of his sculptures, particularly those from the sanctuaries of Pitchi Richi and Mount Dandenong, which have been vandalised, are held in the archives of Australia's libraries. Ricketts, never rich, supported himself through commissioned sales of his art and made pieces as gifts. These signed original small pieces are increasingly sought after for private collections. From 1949 to 1960 he made frequent trips into Central Australia to live with Pitjantjatjara and Arrernte Aboriginal Australians, whose traditions and culture inspired his sculpture. He was not an Aboriginal by blood but considered himself adopted by the Pitjantjatjara nation. He left many of his central Australian works at Pitchi Richi near Alice Springs ‚Äì a bird sanctuary run by his friend Leo Corbet ‚Äì as he considered the landscape integral to these sculptures. From 1912 to 1920 Ricketts developed skills in playing violin, crafting jewellery, and clay modelling. In 1934 he started his major artistic work, creating the sculpture park now named William Ricketts Sanctuary. He worked on this project until his death in 1993. In the 1970s, he spent two years in India, mostly at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram spiritual center in Puducherry, developing spiritual empathy with Indian people and knowledge of their philosophy. To many, including academics such as Marcia Langdon, Bruno David and Mitchell Rolls, Rickets is considered a controversial figure with his beliefs and his sculptures steeped in racism, exploitation and primitivism. Rickets is viewed to have a white saviour complex and is quoted as believing he had been 'called to the defence of the aborigines and the continent' and that 'my creator worked through the Australian aborigine to get hold of me'. Ricket compares his own personal distress over the environment to the suffering of the Aborigines. His trips to central Australia were viewed as controversial and filled with misunderstanding and tensions with Ricket having incorrect preconceived notions of the roles of the Anangu people. A further controversy is all the sculptures in the Dandenong rangers sanctuary are based in real aborigines from central Australia. One issue is displacement and treating a particular group of central Australian aborigines as representative of all aborigines, with no independent integrity afforded to specific people and culture. Further there's the issue of how this park and these sculptures should be viewed by members of the aboriginal groups who they are members of and local aboriginal groups who's country the sculptures sit on, in accordance with traditional law and culture. https://theconversation.com/friday-essay- william-ricketts-sanctuary-is-a-racist-anachronism-but-can-it-foster- empathy-96274 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/13591835030082002 ==William Ricketts Sanctuary== Atirantuka Winged Figure Ricketts' major work is in the sculpture park that he named Potter's sanctuary, but which is now known as William Ricketts Sanctuary.

(He had another child who also danced ballet, Paul Taglioni.) Also, although August Bournonville's version is better known, it was Taglioni who was the original choreographer of La Sylphide, in 1832. == Biography == Born in Milan to father Carlo, he received his dance training predominantly with Carlo Blasis and Jean-Fran√ßois Coulon. He made his dancing debut at age 17 in Pisa performing female roles. He danced in other Italian cities before becoming a dancer (at age 22) with the Paris Opera. With Vestris firmly in control there, he readily accepted an invitation to be a principal dancer and ballet master for the Royal Swedish Ballet in Stockholm, Sweden. In Stockholm, he married the dancer Sophie Karsten, daughter of a famous Swedish opera singer Christoffer Christian Karsten and the Polish actress Sophie Stebnowska, in 1803. Together, they had two children, Marie Taglioni and Paul Taglioni, both of whom became dancers themselves. For several years the family lived in Vienna and Germany but to escape the dangers of the Napoleonic wars, Filippo moved them to Paris. He danced and choreographed throughout Europe, mostly in Italy, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, and Germany. Finally, he was invited to take a more permanent position with the Theater am K√§rntnertor in Vienna. Once settled in Vienna, he sent for Marie, who had been studying ballet in Paris. Upon her arrival, Filippo was discouraged by her artistic progress and began training her himself. He had her practice ballet six hours a day for six months, using a level method of technique training. He was very strict with her, and had no sympathy for her aching and bleeding toes. He sought to make her style light and delicate, with an emphasis on jumps with ballon and pointe work, something that was unheard of before this time. When she was ready he took her back to Paris. After Marie's professional debut she became so popular that Filippo was able to negotiate a six-year contract for the two of them. The triumphant premi√®re of La Sylphide on 12 March 1832, made her the most acclaimed prima ballerina of the Romantic period and him the most renowned choreographer of the day. It is said that the great Romantic period of dance was ushered in on that night. Because of this immense success, the two of them traveled widely together and toured both Europe and Russia. As he grew older, he became eccentric and unpredictable, and eventually lost all of Marie's carefully amassed fortune in unwise speculations. Nevertheless, he must be recognized as a pioneer in a ballet style that was to alter forever the very nature of the art. Taglioni died in Como, Italy on 5 February 1871, at the age of 93. ==Misconceptions about La Sylphide == The ballet-going public knows the Romantic ballet La Sylphide as being choreographed by the Danish ballet master August Bournonville. That is indeed the La Sylphide audiences are most familiar with today but was not the version given in 1832. The original production of La Sylphide was first presented by the Paris Opera Ballet at the Salle Le Peletier in 1832, and was choreographed by Filippo Taglioni himself to the music of Jean Madeleine Schneitzhoeffer, with libretto by Adolphe Nourrit after a story by Charles Nodier. The leading roles were danced by Marie Taglioni and Joseph Mazilier. Bournonville originally intended to stage the 1832 version in Denmark, but the Paris Op√©ra demanded too high a price for the orchestral parts of Schneitzhoeffer's score. In light of this, Bournonville decided to stage his own version of La Sylphide on the same scenario, with a new score by Herman Severin L√∏venskiold. The production premiered in 1836 with the prodigy Lucile Grahn and Bournonville in the principal roles. Due to the strong tradition of the Royal Danish Ballet this version is still being performed in Denmark to this day, and has since been staged throughout the world. In 1972 the ballet master Pierre Lacotte revived Filippo Talgioni's original La Sylphide for the Paris Opera Ballet, with the noted ballerina Ghislaine Thesmar as the Sylph. Schneitzhoeffer's original score was reconstructed from a manuscript held at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. As Taglioni's original choreography was lost long ago, Lacotte choreographed the ballet in the style of the epoch. The Paris Opera Ballet has since released the production onto DVD/video twice. == Works == 1830: Le dieu et la bayad√®re 1832: La Sylphide 1833: La r√©volte au s√©rail 1836: La fille du Danube 1838: La gitana 1839: L'ombre 1840: Le Lac des f√©es 1841: Agla√´, ou L'El√®ve de l'amour 1852 : Satanella oder Metamorphosen based on The Devil in Love (novel) == Bibliography == * Marie Taglioni, Souvenirs.

The band consisted of Becca Albee (vocals and guitar), Carrie Brownstein (guitar and vocals), and Curtis James (drums). The band recorded two full-length albums and a single, and contributed to several compilation albums. ==History== Brownstein, Albee and CJ Phillips (James) came together to form Excuse 17, a band that lasted only a few years would proved to be influential. Brownstein and Albee both played guitar and sang and CJ played the drums. The band quickly recorded a demo tape and then began recording for various compilations on independent record labels. Their first full-length recording, Excuse Seventeen, was released jointly on Atlas Records (LP) and the queercore label Chainsaw Records (CD). They released a second and final album, Such Friends Are Dangerous, on the indie label Kill Rock Stars in 1995, which displayed a boost in recording quality. The band often played shows with Heavens to Betsy, including touring, not surprisingly since both bands were an active part of the riot grrrl scene. They also both appear on the compilation LP/CD Free to Fight. Corin Tucker from Heavens to Betsy struck up a friendship with Brownstein and they dated for a time. They decided to form Sleater-Kinney, a side project that soon evolved into their main focus as their respective groups ended. However, Excuse 17's recordings are still valued by fans of Sleater-Kinney, those interested in riot grrrl and queercore recordings, and record collectors in general: Such Friends Are Dangerous was named one of the fifty best indie rock albums of the Pacific Northwest by online music magazine Pitchfork. Albee also recorded with Tucker as Heartless Martin, releasing a cassette on Chainsaw Records in 1993. Following the dissolution of Excuse 17, Albee has built a successful career in visual art. Her work has been praised by publications including Bomb, Tom Tom, Artforum, and Aperture. Her papers are being preserved by the Fales Library at New York University.

His diplomatic background and choice of capable reporters helped to revive the paper's reputation for international news. ==Biography== Chenery was born in Barbados to John Chenery, a West Indies merchant. He was educated at Eton and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. Immediately after taking an ordinary degree in 1854, he was recruited by Mowbray Morris to work for The Times, and was sent to Istanbul. On arrival in March 1854, he soon proved himself an excellent diplomatic correspondent, covering the Crimean War, mainly from Istanbul, but occasionally from the front, where he relieved William Howard Russell. It was while he was in Istanbul that Chenery met Percy Smythe, who sparked his interest in philological studies, a field in which he would later gain prominence. After the war, Chenery returned to London, where he served as a leader writer for The Times for many years, while continuing his Oriental studies. Among the languages he spoke were Arabic, Hebrew, modern Greek, and Turkish. He was one of the panelists involved in preparing the Old Testament portion of the Revised Version of the Bible. Chenery's translation of the first 26 chapters of the Arabic classic The Assemblies of Al-HaririThe Assemblies of Al-·∏§ar√Æri. Translated from the Arabic with Notes Historical and Grammatical, trans. by Thomas Chenery and F. Steingass, Oriental Translation Fund, New Series, 3, 2 vols (London: Royal Asiatic Society, 1867-98), https://archive.org/details/assembliesofalha015555mbp (vol. 2). led to an appointment as Lord Almoner's Professor of Arabic at the University of Oxford, where he also served as secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society. In 1877 John Walker selected Chenery as John Thadeus Delane's successor as editor of The Times. He was then an experienced publicist, particularly well versed in Oriental affairs, and an indefatigable worker with a rapid and comprehensive judgment, although he lacked Delane's sociability and intuition for public opinion. Nonetheless, he introduced a number of innovations, bringing in more writers with scholarly backgrounds to employ their respective expertise. His background as a diplomatic correspondent and his choice of capable reporters for foreign postings revived the paper's reputation for international news coverage. Despite his position as editor, Chenery was unable to prevent the increasingly partisan slant of the paper imposed by Walter, a member of the Conservative Party. This shift was furthered in 1880 by the appointment of George Earle Buckle, Walter's hand-picked candidate, as assistant editor. Buckle assumed more duties in 1883 as ill health reduced Chenery's ability to play an active role as editor, though he continued in the post until his death on 11 February 1884. He is buried in Brompton Cemetery. ==NotesReferences== * * * ==External links== * * Category:1826 births Category:1884 deaths Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Alumni of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge Category:British newspaper editors Category:The Times people Category:Barbadian journalists Category:Male journalists Category:Christian Hebraists Category:Burials at Brompton Cemetery Category:Lord Almoner's Professors of Arabic (University of Oxford) Category:19th-century British people Category:British people of the Crimean War Category:19th-century British journalists Category:British male journalists ","title":"Thomas Chenery"},{"id":"2231336","text":"The Lucin Cutoff is a railroad line in the western United States in Utah which runs from Ogden to its namesake in Lucin. The most prominent feature of the cutoff was a long railroad trestle crossing the Great Salt Lake; in use from 1904 until the late 1950s, when it was replaced by a rock and dirt causeway. The cutoff was originally built by the Southern Pacific Railroad as a means of shortening the First Transcontinental Railroad. Today the cutoff is owned and operated by the Union Pacific Railroad as a significant part of the Lakeside Subdivision, which runs from Ogden to Wells, Nevada, and is one of the many subdivisions of the Overland Route. Due to the obstruction of waterflow caused by the Lucin Cutoff, the Great Salt Lake appears to be different colors in aerial photographs; water north of the Cutoff appears brown, while water south of the Cutoff is more green. ==HistoryOriginal construction=== Lucin Cutoff (1903) compared to earlier Promontory Branch (1869). Drawn by Aran Raymond, 1981. Built by the Southern Pacific Company (SP) between February 1902 and March 1904, the cutoff bypassed the original Central Pacific Railroad route through Promontory Summit where the Golden spike was driven in 1869. By going west across the lake from Ogden to Lucin, it cut off the original route and also significantly decreased curvature and grades. Built under the direction of SP chief engineer William Hood, a team of 3,000 SP workers worked seven days a week to build the line. When the line opened, it included short causeways extending from the western shore of the lake and the edge of Promontory Point, connected with a nearly wooden trestle. The cutoff also included a causeway which spanned Bear River Bay from the eastern shore of the lake to Promontory Point. This section included a trestle to allow Bear River water to flow into the lake. The line included a rail station called Mid Lake, which was in the middle of the Great Salt Lake. By 1908, five passenger trains and seven freight trains were using the Lucin Cutoff in each direction daily. In 1942, the original line was removed between Lucin and Corinne, Utah ‚Äî with the last Promontory spikes pulled up and the scrap metal donated to the war effort. In late 1944, the cutoff was the site of a train wreck in which 48 people were killed. A westbound freight train ran into the back of a slower moving passenger train in thick fog. ===Trestle replacement=== The trestle was functionally replaced in the late 1950s with a parallel dirt and rock causeway built under contract by Morrison Knudsen of Boise, Idaho. The trestle remained in limited use alongside the causeway, until about 1975. The railroad eventually sold salvage rights to the trestle and Cannon Structures, Inc., through its Trestlewood division, began to dismantle it in the early 1990s. Trestlewood continues to market and sell the salvaged trestle wood. ===Openings in the causeway=== The causeway prevented lake water from flowing as freely as the open trestle had, and to help mitigate effects two culverts were included in the original causeway construction. The culverts allowed for boat traffic, and a limited amount of water to flow from the lake's southern arm (where surrounding freshwater rivers emptied into the lake) into the lake's northern arm. In the early 1980s, Utah experienced heavy flooding, and much of the extra water along the Wasatch Front flowed into the Great Salt Lake. This resulted in the lake experiencing historic high water levels and flooding nearby landowners. To aid the two culverts in channeling water to the northern arm, the State of Utah constructed a bridge at the western end of the causeway. The state breached the causeway under the new bridge on August 1, 1984, allowing pent-up water from the southern arm to flow into the northern arm. The continual slow sinking of the causeway has on occasion required more material to raise its height above the lake level. During the flooding of the 1980s, this buildup included placing 1,430 surplus railcars along the northern edge of the causeway and filling them with rock to act as gabions (this feature is known as the \\"Boxcar Seawall.\\") In March 2011, Union Pacific Railroad (UP) requested permission to close the two 1950s-era culverts because of damage related to age and a sinking of the causeway into the lake bed; the two culverts were closed in 2012 and 2013. To mitigate the effects, the railroad was required to build a bridge and breach the causeway under that bridge. Construction of a bridge was completed in fall 2016, although the railroad agreed to delay opening the breach for a few months, due to environmental and water level concerns. The causeway was breached beneath the 180-foot bridge on December 1, 2016. Since the opening of the causeway the level of the water in the arms of the lake have begun to equalize. As of April 30, 2017, the level of the lake in the northern arm is within a foot of the southern arm. ==References * Union Pacific Website ‚Äì Striking a Balance on the Great Salt Lake * Trestlewood Website ‚Äì Lucin Cutoff Railroad Trestle * Mike's Railroad History ‚Äì Across the Great Salt Lake * Category:Southern Pacific Railroad Category:Bridges completed in 1904 Category:Railroad bridges in Utah Category:Rail infrastructure in Utah Category:Railroad bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Utah Category:Former National Register of Historic Places in Utah Category:Transportation in Box Elder County, Utah Category:Transportation in Weber County, Utah Category:Great Salt Lake Category:Buildings and structures in Box Elder County, Utah Category:Buildings and structures in Weber County, Utah Category:Railroad cutoffs Category:Historic American Engineering Record in Utah Category:National Register of Historic Places in Box Elder County, Utah Category:Wooden bridges in the United States Category:Trestle bridges in the United States ","title":"Lucin Cutoff"},{"id":"2231338","text":"\\"Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal\\" (a parody of the bestselling 1982 tongue- in-cheek book on stereotypes about masculinity Real Men Don't Eat Quiche) is an essay about computer programming written by Ed Post \\"...

The order of performances in the film was rearranged from the order of appearance at the festival. Additionally many artists who appeared at the festival were not included in the original cut of the film. ==Production== The American Broadcasting Company put up a $200,000 advance to get a film made about it for its new ABC Movie of the Week series. However, Monterey Pop never aired on ABC, a decision made by Thomas W. Moore, the head of ABC at the time and, according to Lou Adler, \\"a very conservative Southern gentleman.\\" \\"We showed him Jimi Hendrix fornicating with his amp and we said 'What do you think?' \\" Adler recalls. \\"And he said 'Keep the money and get out.' He said 'Not on my network.' \\" Monterey Pop was shot on 16mm film blown up to 35mm for theatrical release. Director D. A. Pennebaker said he recorded the audio on a professional 8-channel reel-to-reel recorder borrowed from The Beach Boys. The movie's theatrical release used a four-channel soundtrack that included two to three minutes of rudimentary surround sound. Dolby noise reduction was added in 1978 when fresh prints of the film were struck. After Leacock-Pennebaker, the original production company, was dissolved in 1970, Pennebaker Associates acquired rights to the film. ==Home video== When Sony Video released Monterey Pop on videocassette in 1986, Pennebaker created three one-inch tape masters struck from a 16mm negative he had \\"wet-gated\\", a process in which sponges remove particles and also place a fast-drying chemical on the film that fills in scratches. In a digital remix for the video, Pennebaker eliminated the surround track of the theatrical release and mixed the center dialog track into the left and right stereo channels. No Dolby was used, although Sony's initial video release inadvertently stated otherwise on the packaging. In 2002, Monterey Pop was released on DVD as part of a Criterion Collection box set, The Complete Monterey Pop Festival, that also includes Pennebaker's short films Jimi Plays Monterey (1986) and Shake! Otis at Monterey (1986), as well as two hours of outtake performances, including some by bands not seen in the original film. The box set was re-released in 2009 on Blu-ray. For this edition, the soundtracks were remixed in 5.1 Surround Sound by Eddie Kramer. ==Influence== D. A. Pennebaker Rock critic Robert Christgau considers Monterey Pop the best of the 1960s concert documentaries, saying, \\"[T]he music and its... celebrants are like a wonderful secret ‚Äî wonderful because even though everyone knows about it, it still delivers the thrill of discovery. Unveiled in 1968, Pennebaker's vision of the 1967 event was instrumental in convincing potential organizers and participants that music was the healthiest way to crystallize the energy of a counterculture that by then seemed both blessedly inevitable and dangerously embattled.\\" French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard was so taken with Jefferson Airplane's performance in Monterey Pop that later in 1968 he set out to make a never-finished film titled One A.M. (for \\"One American Movie\\") in collaboration with Pennebaker and Leacock. Godard shot a sequence of the Airplane, (included on the 2004 Fly Jefferson Airplane DVD), playing at high noon on a business day on the roof of a New York hotel across the street from the Leacock-Pennebaker offices, with the tower of Rockefeller Center in the background. Attracted by the extremely high volume of the music, the police arrived and put an end to the shooting. The screening of Monterey Pop in theaters helped raise the festival to mythic status, rapidly swelled the ranks of would-be festival-goers looking for the next festival, and inspired new entrepreneurs to stage more and more of them around the country.Mankin, Bill (March 4, 2012). \\"We Can All Join In: How Rock Festivals Helped Change America\\", Like the Dew. Retrieved March 16, 2012. In 1969, Michael Lang and Artie Kornfeld pitched an idea for a recording studio in Woodstock, New York to businessmen John P. Roberts and Joel Rosenman. In the documentary Woodstock: Now and Then, Rosenman said the proposal suggested that the studio would encourage occasional rock concerts in the town. Rosenman had watched Monterey Pop the day before meeting with Lang and Kornfeld and, impressed by the film, agreed, with Roberts to bankroll Lang and Kornfeld in an effort that morphed into the 1969 Woodstock Festival. ==References* Monterey Pop: The First Rock Festival an essay by Michael Lydon at the Criterion Collection * Monterey Pop (35mm and Russian slit-scan photos) on bcx.news Category:1968 films Category:1968 documentary films Category:American films Category:American rock music films Category:American documentary films Category:Concert films Category:Documentary films about music festivals Category:Films directed by D.

Connection pools are used to enhance the performance of executing commands on a database. Opening and maintaining a database connection for each user, especially requests made to a dynamic database- driven website application, is costly and wastes resources. In connection pooling, after a connection is created, it is placed in the pool and it is used again so that a new connection does not have to be established. If all the connections are being used, a new connection is made and is added to the pool. Connection pooling also cuts down on the amount of time a user must wait to establish a connection to the database. ==Applications== Web-based and enterprise applications use an application server to handle connection pooling. Dynamic web pages without connection pooling open connections to database services as required and close them when the page is done servicing a particular request. Pages that use connection pooling, on the other hand, maintain open connections in a pool. When the page requires access to the database, it simply uses an existing connection from the pool, and establishes a new connection only if no pooled connections are available. This reduces the overhead associated with connecting to the database to service individual requests. Local applications that need frequent access to databases can also benefit from connection pooling. Open connections can be maintained in local applications that don't need to service separate remote requests like application servers, but implementations of connection pooling can become complicated. A number of available libraries implement connection pooling and related SQL query pooling, simplifying the implementation of connection pools in database-intensive applications. Administrators can configure connection pools with restrictions on the numbers of minimum connections, maximum connections and idle connections to optimize the performance of pooling in specific problem contexts and in specific environments. ==Database support== Connection pooling is supported by IBM DB2,IBM Connection Pooling Support Microsoft SQL Server,SQL Server Connection Pooling (ADO.NET) Oracle,OCI Driver Connection Pooling MySQL,MySQL Connection Pooling PostgreSQL,PostgreSQL Replication, Clustering and Connection Pooling and Neo4j. ==See also== *Object pool pattern ==References== Category:Database management systems ","title":"Connection pool"},{"id":"2231360","text":"Koteka souvenir The koteka, horim, or penis gourd is a penis sheath traditionally worn by native male inhabitants of some (mainly highland) ethnic groups in New Guinea to cover their genitals. They are normally made from a dried-out gourd, Lagenaria siceraria, although other species, such as Nepenthes mirabilis, are also used. They are held in place by a small loop of fiber attached to the base of the koteka and placed around the scrotum. There is a secondary loop placed around the chest or abdomen and attached to the main body of the koteka. Men choose kotekas similar to ones worn by other men in their cultural group. For example, Yali men favour a long, thin koteka, which helps hold up the multiple rattan hoops worn around their waist. Men from Tiom wear a double gourd, held up with a strip of cloth, and use the space between the two gourds for carrying small items such as money and tobacco. == Traditions == It is traditional clothing in certain New Guinea highlands societies including in the Grand Baliem Valley of Western New Guinea and the Ok Tedi and Telefomin regions of Papua New Guinea. It is worn without other clothing, tied in upward position. == Different identification == Many tribes can be identified by the way they wear their koteka. Some wear them pointed straight out, straight up, at an angle, or in other directions. The diameter of the koteka can also be a clue. Contrary to popular belief, there is little correlation between the size or length of the koteka and the social status of the wearer. Kotekas of different sizes serve different purposes: very short kotekas are worn when working and longer and more elaborate kotekas are worn on festive occasions. The koteka is made of a specially grown gourd. Stone weights are tied to the bottom of the gourd to stretch it out as it grows. Curves can be made in it by the use of string to restrain its growth in whatever direction the grower wishes. They can be quite elaborately shaped in this manner. When harvested, the gourd is emptied and dried. It is sometimes waxed with beeswax or native resins. It can be painted, or have shells, feathers and other decorations attached to it. Sociolinguistically and politically today, the term koteka is used as a name of tribal groups across the highlands of New Guinea, in both West Papua and Papua New Guinea. For example, in West Papua today, there is an Assembly of Koteka Tribes. The term koteka was never used to identify a society or ethnic group before, but it is now commonly known for a tribal group within Melanesia across the highlands of New Guinea. == Sexuality == It is commonly assumed that there is a sexual display element to wearing the koteka; however, according to the locals, kotekas are worn only to cover themselves. == Attempted eradication == In 1971‚Äì1972 the Indonesian New Order government launched \\"Operasi Koteka\\" (\\"Operation Penis Gourd\\") which consisted primarily of trying to encourage the people to wear shorts and shirts because such clothes were considered more \\"modern\\". But the people did not have changes of clothing, did not have soap, and were unfamiliar with the care of such clothes so the unwashed clothing caused skin diseases. There were also reports of men wearing the shorts as hats and the women using the dresses as carrying bags. Eventually the campaign was abandoned. Nevertheless, shirts and pants are required in government buildings, and children are required to wear them in school. == Different uses == A Lonka Lonka, an ornate carved-pearl-shell type of phallocrypt worn by some Aboriginal peoples of Australia Phallocrypts are decorative penis sheaths worn in parts of New Guinea during traditional ceremonies. They are usually made out of gourds or woven fibers and decorated with feathers, beads, cowry shells, and small metal ornaments. The most elaborate phallocrypts are sold to tourists as souvenirs and are not usually representative of ones actually used in ceremonies. A phallocrypt can also be a simple ornament hung from male genitalia as part of a cultural expression, for ceremonial use or pure decoration. Among a number of ancient and modern people throughout the Oceanic world, Africa and many parts of the Americas it was (and still is in some places) a common form of ornamentation. Some Aboriginal peoples of Australia wore an ornate carved-pearl-shell type called a Lonka Lonka. It is hung from the genitals by a twisted thong made of human hair. They are often ornately engraved with mainly geometric patterns and the grooves were colored with reddish ochre. Some South American cultures actually hung heavy, carved jade and other hardstone ornaments from piercings through the skin of their penis and scrotum. These were usually of a temporary ritualistic nature. ===South America and Africa=== Some native South American tribes have used them, mainly in Brazil and the Amazon rainforest area. The use of penis gourds has also been documented in tropical Africa.Heiser CB (1979) The Gourd Book. University of Oklahoma Press, p. 145-160Heiser CB (1973). The penis gourd of New Guinea. Annals of the Association of American Geographers 63: 312‚Äì318. ===Europe=== Penis sheaths were sometimes worn by ancient Romans, often by singers since it was believed that it helped preserve their voice, but also by slaves or regular people to avoid sex. == See also == * Boxer at rest, a Hellenistic Greek sculpture showing infibulation * Codpiece * Kynodesme * Surgical infibulation * Namba (clothing) == References Further reading== * \\"Koteka!

Born in Visinada, Istria (present-day Vi≈æinada, Croatia), she was trained at the ballet school of Teatro alla Scala in Milan and later with dancer/balletmaster Jules Perrot. She was especially noted for her performance in the classic role of \\"Giselle\\". ==Biography== At her 1836 debut in London, Grisi performed with the accomplished danseur Jules Perrot.Review: King's Theatre, in The Times, Wednesday 13 April 1836, p. 5, column C. She next appeared in Paris at the Th√©√¢tre de la Renaissance (1840) and a year later, toured with Perrot to other parts of Europe. Through Perrot's contacts, the pair worked in Paris, London, Vienna, Munich, and Milan where she sang and danced. Of her two talents, it was her dancing that was acclaimed. By dancing Perrot's choreography, which at that time was receiving great attention, she gained notable attention of both the public and the critics. Her greatest role however was that of Giselle. The world premi√®re of this two-act ballet was on 28 June 1841 at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Acad√©mie Royale de Musique, Paris. The part of \\"Albrecht\\" was danced by Lucien Petipa (the brother of the great Marius Petipa), with the part of Myrtha, Queen of the Wilis danced by Ad√®le Dumil√¢tre. It caused a sensation and inspired its reviewers to proclaim Giselle to be the greatest ballet of its time and a triumphant successor to the Romantic masterwork La Sylphide. As such, it immediately established Grisi as a star in her very first full-length ballet in Paris. Her salary grew from 5,000 francs to 12,000 in 1842 and 20,000 by 1844, with additional performance fees on top. It also marked the beginning of a change in her relationship with Jules Perrot. Dance historian Lillian Moore says of her \\"In Grisi were united all the best attributes of the other outstanding ballerinas of the romantic period: the buoyant elevation of Taglioni, the technical virtuosity and mimic powers of Elssler, and the joyous, exuberant facility of Cerrito. If she could not claim to surpass her peers in any one aspect of her art, Grisi outstripped them all in versatility.\\" \\"The Opera Polka as danced by Mlle. Caroltta Grisi & Mons. Perrot\\" by Cesare Pugni (Boston: William H. Oakes, ca.1840s) Grisi's last performance in the west was in Paul Taglioni's Les M√©tamorphoses (aka Satanella, 1849). In 1850, she joined Perrot in St. Petersburg, Russia, where he had been appointed ballet master, and she danced Giselle at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre. The first Giselle in Russia had been danced by Fanny Elssler, and so the initial reaction to Grisi's interpretation of the role was not enthusiastic. However, over time the Russians appreciated her talents. She was Prima Ballerina of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres in St. Petersburg from 1850 to 1853, working not only with Perrot but also Joseph Mazilier who staged for her La Jolie Fille de Gand and Vert-Vert especially for her. Saint- Jean, the district of Geneva in which Grisi retired in 1856 In 1854, with her daughter, she left Russia for Warsaw, where she intended to continue dancing, but she became pregnant by Prince L√©on Radziwill who persuaded her to retire from ballet at the height of her fame. Grisi gave birth to her second daughter, L√©ontine Grisi, and at the age of 34 settled in Saint-Jean, Geneva to spend at Villa Grisi, also called Villa Saint-Jean which is no longer extant,Photograph of Villa Grisi (also called Villa Saint-Jean) here under the Th√©ophile Gautier Society the next 46 years of her life in peaceful retirement.

Grisi's sepulcral vault in a cemetery near Saint-Jean One of the creators of Giselle creators, Th√©ophile Gautier, who was married to Carlotta's sister Ernestina, described her dancing as having a childlike artlessness, a happy and infectious gaiety.

He was the son of Thomas Creswick and Mary Epworth and educated at Hazelwood, near Birmingham. At Birmingham he first began to paint. His earliest appearance as an exhibitor was in 1827, at the Society of British Artists in London; in the ensuing year he sent to the Royal Academy the two pictures named Llyn Gwynant, Morning, and Carnarvon Castle. About the same time he settled in London; and in 1836 he took a house in Bayswater. He soon attracted some attention as a landscape painter, and had a career of uniform and encouraging, though not signal success. In 1842 he was elected an associate, and in 1850 a full member of the Royal Academy, which, for several years before his death, numbered hardly any other full members representing this branch of art. William Miller after Creswick In his early practice he set an example, then too much needed, of diligent study of nature out of doors, painting on the spot all the substantial part of several of his pictures. English and Welsh streams may be said to have formed his favourite subjects, and generally British rural scenery, mostly under its cheerful, calm and pleasurable aspects, in open daylight. This he rendered with elegant and equable skill, color rather grey in tint, especially in his later years, and more than average technical accomplishment; his works have little to excite, but would, in most conditions of public taste, retain their power to attract. Creswick was industrious and extremely prolific; he produced, besides a steady outpouring of paintings, numerous illustrations for books. He was personally genial, a dark, bulky man, somewhat heavy and graceless in aspect in his later years. He died at his house in Bayswater, Linden Grove, after a few years of declining health. Among his principal works may be named England (1847); Home by the Sands, and a Squally Day (1848); Passing Showers (1849); The Wind on Shore, a First Glimpse of the Sea, and Old Trees (1850); A Mountain Lake, Moonrise (1852); Changeable Weather (1865); also the London Road, a Hundred Years ago; The Weald of Kent; the Valley Mill (a Cornish subject); a Shady Glen; the Windings of a River; the Shade of the Beech Trees; the Course of the Greta; the Wharfe; Glendalough, and other Irish subjects, 1836 to 1840; the Forest Farm Frith for figures, and Ansdell for animals, occasionally worked in collaboration with Creswick.

She was a ballerina noted for the brilliance, strength, and vivacity of her dancing. She was also one of few women in the 19th century to be recognized for her talent as a choreographer. ==Life== \\"The grand Pas des √©l√©mens, at Her Majesty's Theatre\\"; 1847; Fanny Cerrito, Carlotta Grisi & Carolina Galetti Rosati Born in Naples, she studied under Carlo Blasis and the French choreographers Jules Perrot and Arthur Saint-L√©on, the latter of whom was her wife nicole perez from 1845‚Äì51. Fanny Cerrito was trained in the ballet school of San Carlo Opera House, later under the supervision of Salvatore Taglioni. Her first stage appearance was in 1832 when she gained recognition almost immediately. In 1836‚Äì37 her fame started to spread beyond Italy and she appeared in Vienna to reveal some of her own choreographed works. From 1838‚Äì40, she continued to dance with La Scala in Milan, where she gained even more attention. In 1843, Cerrito and Maria Taglioni danced in the same program in Milan; this event caused so much excitement that the city divided itself between the two great rival ballerinas. While in Milan, Fanny began her collaboration with Jules Perrot, during which they choreographed Ondine, ou La na√Øade (1843) as well as Alma (1842) and Lalla Rookh (1846). Later in 1845, her choreographic talent became recognized after she presented her own ballet, Rosida. For nine seasons, from 1840 to 1848, Cerrito became a very well-respected dancer at Her Majesty‚Äôs Theatre, London, where the celebrity chef Alexis Soyer created a moulded dessert in her honour that was topped with a miniature figure of the dancer herself, weightlessly poised on a spun sugar zig-zag spiral.Illustrated from one of Soyer's publications, in Michael Garval, \\"Romantic Gastronomies: Alexis Soyer and the Rise of the Celebrity Chef \\" as fig. 14. In 1845, Cerrito danced in the Pas de Quatre with Marie Taglioni, Carlotta Grisi and Lucile Grahn. As the least well-known dancer, Grahn agreed to dance first, while Taglioni had been offered the privilege of dancing in coveted last position, by unanimous consent. However neither Grisi nor Grahn would agree to dance before the other. It required great diplomacy on the part of Benjamin Lumley, the opera manager, to arrange the order of the middle two solos, and when he proclaimed that the elder of the two should go last, Cerrito was reluctant to claim her 'prize'! == References  See also == * Luigi Astolfi * Women in dance Category:1817 births Category:1909 deaths Category:Ballet choreographers Category:Burials at Montmartre Cemetery Category:Italian ballerinas Category:Italian choreographers Category:People from Naples Category:Prima ballerinas Category:19th-century Italian ballet dancers Cerrito ","title":"Fanny Cerrito"},{"id":"2231414","text":"The Haynes Owner's Workshop Manuals (commonly known as Haynes Manuals) are a series of practical manuals from the British publisher Haynes Publishing Group.

The cover of each manual states: \\"based on a complete stripdown and rebuild\\". https://haynes.com/en- us/faqs Each section has step-by-step instructions with diagrams and photographs of an actual stripdown or rebuild. ==For professionals== Manuals for garage professionals include books such as the Automotive Diesel Engine Service Guide, the Automotive Air Conditioning TechBook, Citro√´n and Peugeot Engine Management Systems, and two Engine Management and Fuel Injection Systems Pin Tables and Wiring Diagrams TechBook volumes. ==Distribution== Haynes manuals are published in 15 languages: English (including British, American and Australian variants), French, Swedish, Chinese, Japanese, German, Czech, Finnish, Polish, Bulgarian, Hebrew, Greek, Danish, Spanish (including American Spanish versions), and Russian. ==Location== The company is based in Sparkford, a village near Yeovil in Somerset, England. The Haynes International Motor Museum, the largest motor museum in the UK, is also in Sparkford and it is home to a large collection of both classic and modern cars, and many rarities. ==Authorship== Haynes manuals are written by a pair of authors, and take between 20 and 30 man-weeks. A car or motorcycle is bought at the beginning of the project and sold at the end. Although the workshop phase of the project usually lasts for roughly four weeks, the vehicle is usually retained for a couple of months to ensure it is functioning correctly. ==Manufacturers== Haynes generally has the co-operation of the manufacturers to provide technical information such as mechanical tolerances and wiring diagrams. This may seem against their own interests since servicing can cost 40% of the cost of the vehicle over its lifetime, but manufacturers get loyalty by providing customers with information that lets them fix their vehicle, to their ability, or at least diagnose the fault before taking it to a garage. Over the lifetime of a vehicle, the aftermarket is worth perhaps as much as the new cost price of the vehicle, so the manufacturer still gets a significant revenue from the spare parts, and the longer a vehicle lasts, the more so. == Fictional vehicles == Haynes also publishes manuals for fictional vehicles, such as the from Star Trek and the Ecto-1 from Ghostbusters. ==See also== *Chilton Company *Clymer repair manual *How-to *G.

Around 1850 almost one third of its population of around 1200 was Jewish.

Their best- known films include Salesman (1969), Gimme Shelter (1970) and Grey Gardens (1975). ==BiographyEarly lives=== The brothers were born in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, living there until the family moved to Brookline, Massachusetts when Albert was 13. Albert and David's parents, both Jewish, were immigrants to the United States; their father, born in Ukraine, was employed as a postal clerk, while their mother, originally from Poland, was a schoolteacher. The family originally settled in Dorchester to be near relatives (the brothers' great-uncle Josef Maysles and his daughter and son- in-law, Becky and Joe Kandib) who had moved there earlier. Albert originally pursued a career as a psychology professor and researcher. After serving in World War II, Albert obtained a BA from Syracuse University and MA in psychology from Boston University. He taught psychology at Boston University for three years, also working as a research assistant at a mental hospital and as head of a research project at Massachusetts General Hospital. As an outgrowth of his research work, he traveled to Russia to photograph a mental hospital, and returned the following year with a camera provided by CBS to film his first documentary, Psychiatry in Russia (1955).Albert Maysles profile, yahoo.com; accessed March 6, 2015. Although CBS did not air the film, it was televised on NBC, on the public broadcasting station WGBH-TV in Boston, and on Canadian network television. David also studied psychology at Boston University, receiving a BA. He served in the U.S. Army in West Germany. In the mid-1950s, he worked as a Hollywood production assistant on the Marilyn Monroe films Bus Stop and The Prince and the Showgirl. David later stated that he grew \\"disenchanted with conventional filming. The glamour had faded and the filming of take after take had become tedious.\\" By 1957 he had teamed up with Albert to shoot two documentaries behind the Iron Curtain, Russian Close-Up (credited to Albert Maysles alone) and Youth in Poland, the latter of which was broadcast on NBC. By 1960, the Maysles brothers had joined Drew Associates, the documentary film company founded by photojournalist Robert Drew which also included Richard Leacock and D. A. Pennebaker. Albert would film, while David would handle sound. During this time, the brothers worked on Drew Associates films such as Primary and Adventures on the New Frontier. In 1962, Albert and David left Drew Associates to form their own production company, Maysles Films, Inc. ===Maysles brothers' collaborative years=== The Maysles brothers made over 30 films together. They are best known for three documentaries made in the late 1960s and early 1970s: Salesman (1969), Gimme Shelter (1970), and Grey Gardens (1975). Salesman documents the work of a group of door-to-door Bible salesmen in New England and Florida. Gimme Shelter, a film about The Rolling Stones' 1969 U.S. tour culminating in the disastrous Altamont Free Concert, unexpectedly captured on film the altercation between Altamont attendee Meredith Hunter and Hells Angel Alan Passaro that resulted in Hunter's death. Film footage shows Hunter drawing and pointing a revolver just before being stabbed by Passaro, who was later acquitted of Hunter's murder on self-defense grounds after the jury viewed the footage. Grey Gardens depicts the lives of a reclusive upper-class mother and daughter, \\"Big Edie\\" and \\"Little Edie\\" Beale (who were, respectively, the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis), residing in a derelict mansion in East Hampton, New York. In order to finance these films and others, the Maysles also made commercials for clients such as IBM, Shell Oil, and Merrill Lynch. The Maysles' films are considered examples of the style known as direct cinema. The brothers would let the story unfold as the camera rolled, rather than planning what exactly they wanted to shoot, in keeping with Albert Maysles' stated approach, \\"Remember, as a documentarian you are an observer, an author but not a director, a discoverer, not a controller.\\" However, the brothers also received criticism from those who thought that they had actually planned or otherwise influenced scenes. Most notably, Pauline Kael's negative review of the film Gimme Shelter in The New Yorker included a harsh accusation that much of Gimme Shelter and Salesman had been staged and that the main subject of Salesman, Paul Brennan, was not a Bible salesman as the film portrayed, but was actually a roofing-and-siding salesman recruited as a professional actor. The Maysles brothers threatened legal action against The New Yorker after this accusation. They also sent an open letter to The New Yorker refuting Kael's claims; however, because the magazine at the time did not publish letters, the letter did not appear in print until 1996. In the case of Grey Gardens, the brothers were also accused of unfairly exploiting their subjects. Many of the Maysles' documentaries focus on art, artists and musicians. The Maysles documented The Beatles' first visit to the United States in 1964, and a 1965 conceptual art project by Yoko Ono called \\"Cut Piece\\" in which she sat on the stage of Carnegie Hall while audience members cut off her clothing with scissors. Several Maysles films document art projects by Christo and Jeanne-Claude over a three-decade period, from 1974 when Christo's Valley Curtain was nominated for an Academy Award, to 2005 when The Gates (started in 1979 and completed by Albert after David's death) headlined New York's Tribeca Film Festival. Other Maysles subjects include Marlon Brando, Truman Capote, Vladimir Horowitz, and Seiji Ozawa. For many years, the Maysles worked closely with film editor Charlotte Zwerin, who received a directing credit for her work on Gimme Shelter. Zwerin eventually stopped working with the Maysles because, according to Zwerin, they would not let her produce. ===Death of David Maysles=== David Maysles, the younger brother, died of a stroke on January 3, 1987, seven days shy of his 56th birthday, in New York City. Following his death, Albert was involved in litigation with David's widow over the terms of a financial settlement. According to David's daughter Celia Maysles, this resulted in the family developing a \\"code of silence\\" regarding David. In 2007, Celia released a documentary about her father, Wild Blue Yonder, which included interviews with Albert. Albert Maysles and Antonio Ferrera at the 68th Annual Peabody Awards in 2009 ===Later life and death of Albert Maysles=== After his brother's death, Albert Maysles continued to make films. His notable works include LaLee's Kin: The Legacy of Cotton (2001, co-directed with Deborah Dickson and Susan Froemke), which focused on the struggles of a poor African-American family living in the contemporary Mississippi Delta, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature; and The Love We Make (2011, co- directed with Bradley Kaplan) which documented Paul McCartney's experiences in New York City following the September 11, 2001 attacks, and premiered on Showtime on September 10, 2011, the eve of the tenth anniversary of the attacks. Albert continued the series of documentaries begun with David about the public art of Christo and Jeanne-Claude. He also contributed cinematography to Leon Gast's Academy Award-winning documentary When We Were Kings, about the \\"Rumble in the Jungle\\" Muhammad Ali ‚Äì George Foreman heavyweight championship boxing match. In 2005, Albert founded the Maysles Documentary Center,http://maysles.org/mdc Maysles.org a nonprofit organization dedicated to the exhibition and production of documentary films that inspire dialogue and action, located in Harlem.Mission Statement , maysles.org; accessed March 6, 2015. Albert died of pancreatic cancer at his home in Manhattan on March 5, 2015, aged 88. His films Iris, about fashion icon Iris Apfel, and In Transit, about the longest train route in the United States, were released posthumously later that year. At the time of his death, Albert had also been working on an autobiographical documentary entitled Handheld and from the Heart. ==Legacy and contribution to documentary cinema== By letting real-life action unfold on camera without interference from the crew, the Maysles pioneered the \\"fly on the wall\\" perspective in documentary cinema. This perspective is typical with the genre of documentary known as Direct Cinema which they helped pioneer. This genre is similar to cin√©ma v√©rit√©. They broke tradition with mid-century documentary tropes by eschewing narration, inter-titles and extraneous music tracks. The editing process could be interpreted as their narrative \\"voice,\\" depending on what footage and sound they chose to use and how the timeline of the story unfolded in the final cut. Their success from a technical aspect was based in part on separating the camera from the sound recording device (David used a Nagra) by accurately controlling the speed of the camera and the tape recorder, allowing the two devices to be moved independently with respect to each other, an impossibility in commercially available equipment at the time. Long takes with ordinary equipment of the era would invariably lose synchronization. Albert built his own 16mm camera with existing parts that could be comfortably balanced on his shoulder, eliminating the need for a tripod, allowing him to shoot fluidly in the moment. He added a brace so he could hold the camera steady during long takes. He installed a mirror near the lens and a ring on the focus-pull and could then set the aperture and focus while the camera rolled, ensuring continuity during a take.Maysles, David; Maysles, Albert; Zwerin, Charlotte (Directors) (November 14, 2000). Gimme Shelter (Motion picture). The Criterion Collection DVD commentary: Maysles, Albert. Albert claimed to have a form of attention deficit disorder that made the leisurely pace of editing difficult for him but benefited him while shooting. Stating that his in-the-moment ability to focus let him, \\"Zero in on a situation as it's happening [with his camera] and pay much closer attention and somehow anticipate what's going to happen the next moment, be ready for it and get it, the way people with normal attention spans are incapable of doing.\\" The Maysles brothers' films Salesman and Grey Gardens have been preserved in the Library of Congress' National Film Registry as being culturally, historically or aesthetically significant. In May 2002, Ralph Blumenthal in The New York Times referred to Albert as \\"the dean of documentary film making\\" and Jean-Luc Godard once called Albert \\"the best American cameraman\\". The moving image collection of Albert and David Maysles is held at the Academy Film Archive. The archive has preserved two of the Maysles' films: Showman, in 2012, and Salesman, in 2018. ==Awards== Their only Oscar nomination was for the 1973 short film Christo's Valley Curtain.

Recruitment for the band began with the arrival in London of the guitarist Agi (Chinese: ÈæôÂÆΩ Long Kuan), who later gained broad fame in the electronic duo ÈæôÂÆΩ‰πùÊÆµ Longkuan Jiuduan. Another Mika (Mika Kanayama) on bass introduced an element of musicality to the bass department while a North London boy, Ergi, provided the drums. Mika has a husband and two boys, and Ergi has a wife and two daughters. In 2000, they signed with the Beastie Boys' label Grand Royal. Mika Bomb performed in the West Country plugging their singles \\"Super Sexy Razor Happy Girls\\" and \\"Heart Attack\\". They fused Motown, New York punk, 1950s garage rock and Japanese pop to form a distinctive, distortion-heavy pop sound. 2001 saw the release of their debut album The Fake Fake Sound of Mikabomb on the Damaged Goods label after Grand Royal went bust. Through their career they have played with At the Drive-In, The Donnas, Snuff, Bis, The Datsuns, The D4, Ten Benson and Rosita. In 2005, they released their second album, Hellcats, which featured a cover of Holly Golightly's \\"Won't Go Out\\", with Mika and Holly herself performing a duet on lead vocals. On 10 December 2005, drummer Ergi fell ill and was rushed to hospital where he was diagnosed as having septicaemia. He survived a week- long, near-fatal coma, but had both his legs amputated below the knee. There were several fundraising events in 2006 to help Ergi cope with the changes in his life, the highlight being a benefit gig at The Garage, Highbury Corner, Islington, London on 15 May 2006. After making appearance at Rock My Ass festival, Bamberg, Germany in September 2006, the band ceased recording or live activities.

With Manuel Lopes and Jorge Barbosa, he was the founder of Claridade. In 1947 he published Chiquinho, considered the greatest Cape Verdean novel and O dialecto crioulo de Cabo Verde which describes different dialects of creoles of Cape Verde. He sometimes wrote under the pseudonym Osvaldo Alc√¢ntara. Ressaca, his work of poems can be found on the CD Poesia de Cabo Verde e Sete Poemas de Sebasti√£o da Gama by Afonso Dias. ==Biography== Baltasar Lopes da Silva was born in the village of Calej√£o on the island of S√£o Nicolau in Cape Verde on April 23, 1907. He attended the seminary in Ribeira Brava in his native island. He later headed to Portugal and studied at the University of Lisbon. When he was at Lisbon, Baltasar Lopes studied with the most important writers and authors of the Portuguese culture including Vitorino Nem√©sio and Lu√≠s da C√¢mara Reis. He graduated with degrees in Law and Romance Philology, he was one of the excellent students at the university. Afterwards, he returned to Cape Verde and was professor at Liceu Gil Eanes in Mindelo, S√£o Vicente island, for a few years, he was also the lyceum's rector. He returned to Portugal again and educated in Leiria for a short time, during the difficulties of relationship with Portuguese politics that occurred that time, he returned to Cape Verde where he continued his education and advocacy. His last days were spent in Lisbon, where he was transferred for treatment of a cerebrovascular disease and died shortly afterwards on May 28, 1989. ==Career== Baltasar Lopes, with the collaboration of other writers, such as Manuel Lopes, Manuel Ferreira, Ant√≥nio Aur√©lio Gon√ßalves, Francisco Jos√© Tenreiro, Jorge Barbosa, and Daniel Filipe, founded the Cape Verdean journal Claridade in 1936. Claridade published essays, poems, and short stories. Its contributors wrote about the problems of their society, such as drought, famine, and emigration, bringing clarity to the study of Cape Verdean reality, especially with regard to the most disadvantaged social groups. In 1947, Lopes published his first book, the novel Chiquinho. Chiquinho describes in detail the customs, people, landscapes, and social problems of Cape Verde in early twentieth century. It is a coming-of-age novel about the people of Cape Verde and the step that many Cape Verdeans had to take to achieve a better life: emigration. The novel is organized into three parts: * 1. \\"Childhood\\" (Inf√¢ncia), in which the protagonist Chiquinho lives with his family and community in the village of Caleij√£o on the island of S√£o Nicolau and learns his first letters. * 2. \\"S√£o Vicente,\\" in which Chiquinho continues his education in high school on the island of S√£o Vicente, where he meets new friends and his first love Nuninha. Chiquinho and his classmates found the Gr√©mio, an association and a journal that is very similar to Claridade, in the sense that it attempts to change the social environment of the archipelago. * 3. \\"The Waters\\" (As √Åguas), the third and final part of the novel, in which Chiquinho returns to his island and becomes a teacher. This part is focused on the calamity of drought, a major problem in Cape Verde, which results in famine and many deaths. At the end of the novel, Chiquinho emigrates to the United States with the hope of a better life. ==Family== Baltasar Lopes da Silva belonged to a family of great literary figures of Cape Verde including Ant√≥nio Aur√©lio Gon√ßalves and poet Jos√© Lopes da Silva. ==Works== * Chiquinho (1947) * A Caderneta * Cabo Verde visto por Gilberto Freyre [Cape Verde Visited by Gilberto Freyre] (1956) * O dialecto crioulo de Cabo Verde, a description of the Cape Verdean creole language (1957). * Antologia da Fic√ß√£o Cabo-Verdiana Contempor√¢nea [Contemporary Anthology of Cape Verdean Fiction] (1961) * C√¢ntico da Manh√£ Futura (1986), volume of poetry published under the name Osvaldo Alc√¢ntara * Os Trabalhos e os Dias (short stories, 1987) ==Legacy== Avenida Baltar Lopes da Silva, an avenue named after the writer A street named after the writer (Avenida Baltasar Lopes da Silva) is located in the north of Mindelo slightly northeast of the city center.

Kind, but not very bright. * Mr. Purgon, physician to Argan, who exploits his hypochondria. * Mr. Diafoirus, a physician. * Thomas Diafoirus, his son, betrothed to Angelique by her father. Nephew of Mr. Purgon. * Mr. Fleurant, an apothecary. * Mr. de Bonnefoi, a notary. * Toinette, witty maid- servant of Argan. ==SynopsisAct 1=== The play opens with Argan, a severe hypochondriac, going through the bill from his apothecary (the pharmacist) item by item. He pays out only about half of what is on the bill. That done, he calls for his maid, Toinette. When she fails to appear immediately he shouts and calls her names until she arrives. Toinette is not interested in putting up with Argan's temper, so she mocks his rage. Eventually he gives up trying to scold her and asks her to call in his daughter, Angelique. Angelique is ready to talk to him, but Argan must leave the room for a short while (presumably the result of an \\"injection\\" [i.e., enema] he's just had). While he is out, Angelique takes the opportunity to talk to Toinette. We quickly find out that she has been talking almost non-stop about the qualities of a young man named Cl√©ante since she met him at a play six days ago. She expects Cl√©ante to ask her father if he can marry her, within a few days. Argan returns and expects to surprise his daughter when he tells her that someone has asked to marry her. He is shocked to find that she not only knows about it, but could not be happier. Unfortunately, Angelique thinks he's been talking about Cl√©ante, while her father has promised his daughter to Thomas Diaforious, the son of a respected Paris doctor who is soon to be made a doctor himself. Toinette asks him why, with all his money, Argan would want a doctor for a son-in-law. He replies that since he is always ill, he thought it would be a good idea to have a doctor in the family. Then he could have Thomas Diaforious' services as doctor all the time, not to mention the services of his father and his uncle for free. Toinette will not take his hypochondria seriously and tells him that she knows Angelique will never agree to that marriage. More than that, Toinette downright forbids the union to happen. This is amazing gall for a servant, and Argan becomes so incensed that he chases Toinette around the room threatening to kill her. Finally he stops, exhausted, and claims he is dying. Hearing the disturbance, Argan's second wife B√©line runs in. She soothes Argan, talking to him as one would to a child throwing a temper tantrum. Once his new wife has calmed him, Argan asks if she has contacted a notary; he intends to change his will to include (and heavily favour) B√©line. She dramatically begs him not to think of such things, but just happens to have the notary to hand. B√©line repeatedly claims that she doesn't care about the money, but double-checks the amounts all the same. The notary warns Argan that he can't leave his wife anything, but instructs him on several devious and underhanded methods whereby B√©line could get all the money. Meanwhile, outside the study, Toinette and Angelique have a chance to talk in private. Toinette warns Angelique that her stepmother is plotting to get her inheritance, but Angelique does not care, so long as she is allowed to marry as she wishes. She begs Toinette to help her foil her stepmother and father's plans, a proposition to which Toinette is only too delighted to agree. She also endeavors to find a way to tell Cl√©ante of the intended marriage. ===Act 2=== Cl√©ante shows up in disguise at the door, surprising Toinette. He has come pretending to be a substitute for Angelique's music teacher so he can talk to her in private. However, when Argan learns of the \\"music master's\\" arrival, he decides that he wants to watch the music lesson, spoiling everyone's plans. When Angelique comes in, she is shocked to find Cl√©ante there, but manages to cover her reaction. Then Argan invites Cl√©ante to stay as a guest as Angelique is introduced to her fianc√©, Thomas Diaforious. When Mr. Diaforious and his son Thomas enter, Mr. Diaforious tells Thomas to begin. Thomas asks if he should start with Argan and, once his father tells him to, he greets Argan with a florid prepared speech. Once finished, he asks his father if that was satisfactory and if he should continue. He has a fancy prepared speech ready for every member of the family. Everyone has a seat and Argan praises Thomas. Mr. Diaforious says that he is very pleased with his son. He says that as a child he was never very bright or exciting and he never has had any wit or liveliness, but he has sound judgement. What Mr. Diaforious is most happy about in his son, though, is that he blindly adheres to the ancient medical beliefs and refuses to believe the new modern ideas like \\"circulation of the blood.\\" Argan asks if Thomas is to become a doctor for the rich at court. Mr. Diaforious says he much prefers to treat the common people. He adds that with ordinary people he is less accountable to anybody and, as long as procedure is followed, there is no need to worry so much about the results; the rich are much more difficult since they actually seem to expect to be cured. Argan then tells Cl√©ante to help Angelique sing a song for the party. Cl√©ante gives her a scroll of music with no words and tells everyone that it is a short piece from an improvised opera. Cl√©ante then sings his love and his questions to Angelique in the guise of this opera. She answers him in the same form, telling him that she really loves him and despises the man her father wants her to marry. Their song continues until Argan stops it, thinking it dreadfully inappropriate. He sends Cl√©ante away. Argan tells Angelique to pledge herself to Thomas, but she refuses. She suggests that they ought to get to know each other first. Argan, however, disagrees. He says that there will be plenty of time for getting to know each other once they are married. As for Thomas, it is enough for him that his father has instructed him to be in love with her. Angelique tries to argue the point with him, but the arguing proves useless. Argan gets angry with Angelique's willfulness and everyone's failure to pay attention to him during the fight. He tells Angelique that she has four days to decide. Either she marries Thomas, or she goes into a convent. Angelique runs out and B√©line decides to go to town for a while. Argan is left with the two doctors and begs them to examine him. It is very obvious they do not know what they are doing. However, they make up lies which are good enough to convince Argan the hypochondriac. On her way out, B√©line stops to tell Argan that she saw Angelique talking with a young man who ran away as soon as they were spotted. She tells him that his youngest daughter, Louison, saw everything. Argan calls Louison to him for an interrogation. After much coaxing and Louison faking her own death, she tells him that the man claiming to be Angelique's music teacher came to her window and told her over and over how he loved her. Argan's brother, Beralde, who is a lawyer, comes to visit him. He is not convinced by Argan's claims about how sick he is. Beralde tells his brother that he has a match for Angelique. At the mention of his daughter's name, Argan flies into a rage and Beralde calms him by telling him about a dance troupe that has come to amuse him. There is a dance interlude as Gypsies dance and sing about the joys of young love and the pain when it proves false. ===Act 3=== The Imaginary Invalid, drawing by Honor√© Daumier, c. 1857. Now that they have both enjoyed the interlude, Beralde wants to have a chat with his brother, but Argan insists he must take a short walk first (he's had another \\"injection\\"). Once Argan is gone, Toinette begs Beralde not to give up on helping his niece. He says that he will do everything he can. Toinette hints that she has a plan herself, but cannot tell what it is because her master has returned. Now that Argan has returned, Beralde first asks his brother why he would want to send his daughter to a convent. Beralde points out that sending them to a convent was Beline's idea and suggests that she might want the children out of the way for her own reasons, but Argan gets angry and leaps to her defense. Then Beralde asks Argan why he would want to marry his daughter to a doctor so unsuited for her. Argan says that if the doctor is good enough for him, he is good enough for Angelique. Beralde wants to hear no more of this. He points out to Argan that he (Argan) is one of the healthiest people he (Beralde) knows and that Argan's infatuation with doctors and apothecaries is bad for him and everyone else. The doctors, he says, know nothing about the workings of the human body and therefore can do nothing to cure it. The doctors are only educated enough to give fancy Latin names to the things they do not comprehend. They will kill their patients with the best of intentions, but they will still be dead. Beralde believes that all one need do is rest and let nature take its course. Mr. Fleurant, the apothecary and Purgon's assistant, comes in with a new remedy for Argan. Beralde asks Argan not to take the remedy and to put it off until tomorrow, but this makes Fleurant very angry and he storms off to tell Dr. Purgon about this interference. Beralde tries once again to get his brother to give up his addiction to doctors, but Argan claims to be too sick. Just then Mr. Purgon enters in a furious temper, having been told that his cure was sent back, and rages at Argan. He refuses to treat Argan any more and says that within a few days Argan will go from one horrible disease to another and finally die. With that, he storms out. Left with Beralde again, Argan cries and says that he can already feel his system shutting down, just as Mr. Purgon had told him. Beralde thinks he is crazy and tells him so, but Argan won't listen. He is sure that he is already dying. Toinette comes in and says that a new doctor has arrived who wants to treat Argan. She doesn't know who the man is, but says that he looks exactly like her. Argan is desperate and consents to see him. Toinette comes in dressed as a doctor and claims to be one of the world's greatest doctors who has come to see Argan, one of the world's most illustrious patients. She tells Argan that all of his previous doctors were idiots who have totally misdiagnosed him. Argan tells him everything that has been prescribed, and Toinette (as the doctor) contradicts every one, saying his doctors were ignorant quacks. She goes on to make him realize that not everything doctors tell him is true; she blames his one arm for taking up all the nutrients, so he should have it amputated so as to make his other arm stronger. She also says that one of his eyes is taking up all the nutrients that go to it, so if he has it removed, his remaining eye will see much better. After spouting more of this medical nonsense, the \\"doctor\\" leaves and Toinette comes back on as herself, supposedly outraged that the departing \\"doctor\\" has been trying to take liberties with her (wanting to \\"take [her] pulse\\"). Beralde then tries to convince his brother that since he has already fallen out with Purgon, he should consider a different marriage for his daughter. But Argan wants her put into a convent as a punishment for her willfulness. Beralde suggests that the real reason is that Beline wants it. Argan begins to get angry again, but Toinette steps in and says she has a solution to prove to Beralde how much Beline loves her husband. She suggests that Argan lie down on the couch and pretend to be dead. Then everyone will see how she really feels about him by her grief. Everyone thinks this is an excellent plan. Beralde hides as Beline comes in. She finds Toinette crying and Toinette tells her Argan is dead. Beline does not shed a tear, but is instead overjoyed that Argan is finally dead. She calls him many horrible names, then asks Toinette to help her cover up his death until she can get his money. With that, Argan gets up and surprises Beline. He shouts that he's glad to have found her out as she runs off. Just then they hear Angelique coming, and Toinette suggests he do the same thing to find out how she feels. When Angelique hears that her father is dead, she is inconsolable. She cries and says that she has lost one of the dearest things in the world to her. She is even more upset because she has lost him when he was still angry with her. Cl√©ante comes in to comfort her, but it is no good. She tells Cl√©ante that they can never get married now; since her father's last wishes were that she be a nun, that is what she will do. With that, Argan gets up and hugs his daughter. She and Cl√©ante are both delighted that he is alive. Argan agrees to their marriage, saying that she and Cl√©ante can marry... as long as Cl√©ante becomes a doctor. He agrees, but Beralde stops him. He suggests that Argan should just become a doctor himself, since no disease would dare to attack a doctor. Argan approves of the idea and Beralde says he knows a number of members of the medical faculty who can make Argan a doctor that very night. He invites the gypsy dancers back and they perform a ceremony in song and dance that, they claim, makes Argan a doctor (in the translation by John Wood, Argan suffers a heart attack during the dance and dies, whereupon the dancers stop dancing and assume deaths-head masks). ==Stage productions== * The first known Broadway production was performed at the Liberty Theatre in March 1917http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=8521 with a translation by Katherine Prescott Wormeley. * Le Malade Imaginaire was performed at the Stratford Festival in 1958, 1974 1993, and 2016. * The latest Broadway production was performed at the ANTA Playhouse 1‚Äì13 May 1967 with Denholm Elliott as Dr. Diaforus.http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=2941 * Th√©√¢tre Chatelet with Les Arts Florissants; music-director, William Christie (1999); complete production using original/early sources, performing styles, and scenic design etc.; viewable online at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtl7KkcrhNQ * The American Conservatory Theater (San Francisco) produced \\"The Imaginary Invalid\\", an 'adaptation' by Constance Congdon, directed by Ron Lagomarsino, in 2007. * Theatre Spirits staged a Hindi adaptation of 'Le malade imaginaire', titled 'Hardam Mareez', in September 2007 in Sri Ram Centre of Performing Arts, directed by Sanjeev Sharma. ==Audio recordings== An hour-long version adapted by Richard MacDonald was broadcast on the NBC radio series Great Plays on 15 December 1940.

Azara in some of its alternative common names is a reference to Spanish naturalist F√©lix de Azara. ==Description== Pampas fox dentition (right) compared with that of red fox (left) The pampas fox resembles the culpeo or Andean fox in appearance and size, but has a proportionately wider snout, reddish fur on the head and neck, and a black mark on the muzzle. Its short, dense fur is grey over most of the body, with a black line running down the back and onto the tail, and pale, almost white, underparts. The ears are triangular, broad, and relatively large, and are reddish on the outer surface and white on the inner surface. The inner surfaces of the legs are similar in color to the underparts, while the outer surface is reddish on the fore limbs, and grey on the hind limbs; the lower hind limb also bears a distinctive black spot. Adults range from in body length, and weigh ; males are about 10% heavier than females. In the northern part of its range, the pampas fox is more richly colored than in the southern part. ==Distribution and habitat== The pampas fox can be found in northern and central Argentina, Uruguay, eastern Bolivia, Paraguay, and southern Brazil. It prefers open pampas habitats, often close to agricultural land, but can also be found in montane or chaco forest, dry scrubland, and wetland habitats. It is most common below elevation, but can inhabit puna grasslands up to . Five subspecies are currently recognised, although the geographic range of each is unclear, and the type localities of three of them lie outside the present-day range of the species: * L. g. gymnocercus - northeastern Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil * L. g. antiquus - central Argentina * L. g. domeykoanus - first described from northern Chile * L. g. gracilis - first described from western Argentina * L. g. maulinicus - first described from central Chile Fossils of this species are known from the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene of Argentina. ==Local names== In the Spanish- speaking areas of its habitat, the pampas fox is known by the common names of zorro de las pampas or zorro gris pampeano. In Portuguese-speaking Brazil, it is called by the common names of graxaim or sorro. ==Behavior and diet== The pampas foxes mostly live a solitary life, but come together as monogamous pairs in the breeding season to raise their young. They are mainly nocturnal, becoming active at dusk, although may also be active during the day. They den in any available cavity, including caves, hollow trees, and the burrows of viscachas or armadillos. Even when raising young together, adult foxes generally hunt alone, marking their territory by defecating at specific latrine sites. Although considerable variation is seen, the home range of a typical pampas fox has been estimated to be around . Pampas foxes are more omnivorous than most other canids, and have a varied and opportunistic diet. Their primary prey consists of birds, rodents, hares, fruit, carrion, and insects, although they also eat lizards, armadillos, snails and other invertebrates, lambs, and the eggs of ground-nesting birds. Their primary predators are pumas, domesticated dogs, and anacondas, most notably the yellow anaconda. ==Reproduction== Pampas foxes breed in the early spring, with the female coming into heat just once each year. After a gestation period of 55 to 60 days, the mother gives birth to a litter of up to eight kits. The young are born between September and December, and are weaned around two months of age. Females reach sexual maturity in their first year, and animals have lived for up to 14 years in captivity. Pups hunt with parents when they are 3 months old.

During the Renaissance time period it was used in a Platonic format to designate the \\"aetheric vehicle or starlike garment surrounding the soul which descended from heaven and entered the individual body\\". It was thought to be one of the three parts of the human soul that contained the \\"thoughts, cogitations, desires, imaginations that were impressed upon the mind at the time of death\\" as well as lust and anger. The philosopher Marsilio Ficino considered it to be a link between the physical body and the incorporeal soul while others such as Jean Fernel associated it more with animal spirits. Philosopher Henry More introduced the term into the medical setting and considered the astral spirit to be a part of the body that was separate from the \\"rational soul\\". More's viewpoint was criticized as \\"[reducing] spiritual phenomena ... to pseudo- physical explanations\\". Astral spirits have also been associated with the familiar spirit and witchcraft, specifically black magic, and was considered at one point to be demonic in origin. This definition of astral spirits considered the entities to be completely separate from the concept of the astral spirit as something that was considered to be part of or attached to the human body or soul. The term was also used in relation to the concept of ghosts and vampirism, as spiritualists in the nineteenth century believed that the astral spirit would rise from the grave of the deceased in order to steal the blood and vitality of the living while the physical body would remain in the grave. This form of the astral spirit, while sometimes considered to be harmful, fell into the Platonic definition as it was considered to be a remnant of the deceased in some form. Astral spirits were also considered to be potentially capable of fathering a child, as there were some tales of astral spirits reportedly impregnating the wife of a deceased hajduk. ==References== Category:Deities and spirits Category:Shamanism Category:Theosophical philosophical concepts ","title":"Astral spirit"},{"id":"2231497","text":"Hibbat Zion () may refer to: *Hibat Tzion, a moshav in central Israel. *An alternative name for Hovevei Zion.

After the main Swedish army had been defeated at the Battle of Oravais the army under Johan August Sandels in Savonia had to retreat in order not to be outflanked by the Russians. Sandels found a good defensive position north of Iisalmi and decided to resist the Russian advance there. Between September 29 and October 27 a cease-fire was in effect. Sandels was heavily outnumbered but had a good defensive position between two lakes connected by the Koljonvirta river and he had prepared his position well during the cease-fire. On October 27 the cease-fire was to end at 1 PM, but Russians started their attack a little earlier, perhaps because of the time difference between Sweden and Russia. Sandels pulled back the forces on the south side of the river and the Russians attacked over the partially demolished bridge. The Swedes counter-attacked and literally pushed the Russian troops into the river. The Russians pulled up fresh troops on the south side of the river, but they didn't try to attack again.

She has written nine books on lesbian theater and sixty-five plays, musicals, and one-woman shows. A lesbian feminist, her work emphasizes non-traditional roles for women and lesbian characters. ==Early life== Gage earned a masters in theater arts from Portland State University. ==Career== Gage's best known work is The Second Coming of Joan of Arc, a one-woman play about the historical figure Joan of Arc. It has been translated into Portuguese, French, Italian, Bulgarian, and Mandarin and achieved first-class production in Brazil, starring Christiane Torloni. The script was published in The Second Coming of Joan of Arc and Selected Plays, an anthology of Gage's historical plays. The anthology was named the national winner of the 2008 Lambda Literary Award in Drama. Other notable work includes Ugly Ducklings, which was nominated by the American Theatre Critics Association for the prestigious ATCA/ Steinberg New Play Award, an award with given annually for the best new play produced outside New York. It won a 2004 Lesbian Theatre Award from Curve magazine, and a $150,000 documentary on the play premiered in 2005 at the Frameline International Film Festival in San Francisco. In 2004, The Anastasia Trials in the Court of Women was named national finalist for the Jane Chambers Award given by the Association for Theatre in Higher Education. Harriet Tubman Visits a Therapist was presented at Actors Theatre of Louisville in the Juneteenth Festival of African American plays. It was a national winner of the Samuel French Off-Off Broadway Festival, and is included in Random House's anthology Under 30: Plays for a New Generation.

The University of Oregon archive acquired her personal papers in 2004. In December 2014, Gage was awarded the first Lifetime Achievement Award given by Venus Theatre, founded by Deborah Randall in Laurel, Maryland. During the ceremony also celebrating the theatre's 50th production, she revived the memories of actresses, playwrights and directors Eva Le Gallienne, Henrietta Vinton Davis and Minnie Maddern Fiske who faced tremendous opposition to their work from the cultural establishment of their time. The American activist and playwright John Stoltenberg, lifelong companion of radical feminist Andrea Dworkin, said about Gage's acceptance speech: > Her acceptance speech, which she spoke off-the-cuff from notes, had a > profound effect on the audience, because in it she described real and raw > truths about what it means to work in theater as a woman. In 2018, Gage was interviewed for an investigation about how invisible disabilities tend to be hidden by creative professionals in the American show business in order not to experience discrimination, having herself concealed for years her myalgic encephalomyelitis, or chronic fatigue syndrome, she suffered from since 1988. ==WorksBooks=== * The Second Coming of Joan of Arc and Selected Plays (2008) * Nine Short Plays (2008) * Starting from Zero: One-Act Plays About Lesbians in Love * The Spindle and Other Lesbian Fairy Tales (2010) * Take Stage!

Later it manufactured storage network products. Alacritech's main products were the ANX 1500 series of network throughput acceleration appliances. ==History== Alacritech was founded in 1997 by Larry Boucher, the author of the SCSI standard and founder of both Auspex Systems and Adaptec. The company's network interface cards (NICs) were promoted for enhanced performance by moving some TCP/IP processing from the CPU to the NIC. In 2004, Alacritech sued Microsoft and Broadcom for patent infringement. The suits were settled in 2005 with both companies agreeing to license the Alacritech patents. In 2008 Alacritech decided that the TOE / NIC business was not sufficient to sustain a viably growing company, and changed its focus to leveraging this technology for accelerating of network attached storage (NAS), resulting in the development of the ANX series of appliances. == Appliances == The ANX 1500 throughput acceleration appliance supported TCP/IP, NFS, DHCP and 10GbE standards and features 48GB of DRAM and up to 4TB of solid state drives. The ANX 1500 caches active data stemming from client requests, such as frequent access of the same payload data or NFS metadata, and optimizes performance through the use of TCP and NFS Offload technology embedded in Alacritech's custom silicon. The ANX 1500 has a two-tiered caching system that provides record performance by accelerating READ and NFS metadata-intensive OPS, greatly reducing the burden on existing NAS devices, and enabling better WRITE performance and scalability. With a performance layer based on frequency of use, NFS OPS are maximized, resulting in reduced traffic on backend NAS servers, and a dramatic reduction in total IOPS required and storage drives needed from back-end storage. The ANX 1500 accelerates NFS throughput and enhances the performance of existing NAS boxes. A single ANX 1500, with 4TB of SSDs, can deliver 120,000 NFS SPECsfs2008 operations per second (OPS) and an ORT of .92ms and only requires 1/5 of the NAS infrastructure otherwise required to deliver the comparable NFS OPS performance. The appliance allows enterprises to achieve significantly higher disk utilization, using 80 percent of available disk space, versus the current standard of 20 percent in performance environments. ==Present operation== The company did not achieve sufficient sales of the ANX product line to sustain ongoing operations and development, and shut down manufacturing and development operations in November 2013. The company website currently notes that the ANX product line is no longer being manufactured, but provides links for support of existing installations. As of 2018 the company was in the business of licensing its technology. ==References *Alacritech, Inc. website Category:Networking companies of Canada ","title":"Alacritech"},{"id":"2231512","text":"Thomas Belsham Thomas Belsham (26 April 1750 ‚Äì 11 November 1829) was an English Unitarian minister == Life == Belsham was born in Bedford, England, and was the elder brother of William Belsham, the English political writer and historian. He was educated at the dissenting academy at Daventry, where for seven years he acted as assistant tutor. After three years spent in a charge at Worcester, he returned as head of Daventry Academy, a post which he continued to hold till 1789, when, having adopted Unitarian principles, he resigned. With Joseph Priestley for colleague, he superintended during its brief existence the New College at Hackney, and was, on Priestley's departure in 1794, also called to the charge of the Gravel Pit congregation. In 1805, he accepted a call to the Essex Street Chapel, which was also headquarters and offices of the Unitarian Church under John Disney, there succeeding as minister Theophilus Lindsey who had retired and died three years later in 1808. Tomb of Theophilus Lindsey (d. 1808), Elizabeth Rayner (d. 1800) and Thomas Belsham (d. 1829) in Bunhill Fields burial ground Belsham remained at Essex Street, in gradually failing health, until his death in Hampstead, on 11 November 1829. He was buried in Bunhill Fields burial ground, in the same tomb as Theophilus Lindsey. His joint executors were Thomas Field Gibson and his father. == Beliefs == Belsham's beliefs reflect that transition that the Unitarian movement was going through during his lifetime, particularly from the early Bible-fundamentalist views of earlier English Unitarians like Henry Hedworth (who introduced the word \\"Unitarian\\" into print in English from Dutch sources in 1673) and John Biddle, to the more Bible-critical positions of Priestley's generation. Belsham adopted critical ideas on the Pentateuch by 1807, the Gospels by 1819, and Genesis by 1821.\\"But by 1807, Belsham had already concluded that the Pentateuch was of composite authorship; by 1819, he had doubts about the present form of the gospels, and by 1821, he had concluded that the account of Creation in Genesis was ...\\" . Later, following Priestley, Belsham was to dismiss the virgin birth as \\"no more entitled to credit, than the fables of the Koran, or the reveries of Swedenborg.\\" (1806)\\"Compare Richard Wright, the celebrated Unitarian missionary, An Essay on the Miraculous Conception of Jesus Christ (London, 1808)\\" . == Works == Belsham's first work of importance, Review of Mr Wilberforces Treatise entitled Practical View (1798), was written after his conversion to Unitarianism. His most popular work was the Evidences of Christianity; the most important was his translation and exposition of the Epistles of St Paul (1822). He was also the author of a work on philosophy, Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind (1801), which is entirely based on Hartley's psychology. In 1812 Belsham published the Memoirs of the Late Reverend Theophilus Lindsey, M.A., his predecessor at Essex Street. This included a chapter titled \\"American Unitarianism\\" arguing that many American clergy entertained Unitarian views. The Calvinist minister Jedidiah Morse published the chapter separately, as part of his campaign against New England's liberal ministers‚Äîcontributing to \\"the Unitarian Controversy\\" (1815) that eventually produced permanent schism among New England's Congregationalist churches. His main Christological work was A Calm Inquiry into the Scripture Doctrine concerning the Person of Christ (1817). [Reprint: Morrisville, North Carolina: Lulu.com, 2009.] Belsham was one of the most vigorous and able writers of his church, and the Quarterly Review and Gentlemans Magazine of the early years of the 19th century abound in evidences that his abilities were recognized by his opponents.

In a career that spanned the 1940s and 1950s, she appeared in several films and radio programs, and entertained the troops during World War II and the Korean War on USO tours with Bob Hope. ==Early years== Maxwell was a native of Clarinda, Iowa. During the 1930s, she worked as an usher in Fort Wayne, Indiana at the Rialto Theater located at 2616 South Calhoun Street. In Fort Wayne, she attended Central High School. She dropped out of school in her sophomore year to join an Indianapolis band as a singer. ==Career== From the trailer for Stand by for Action (1942) She started her professional entertaining career as a radio singer and a singer on stage with Ted Weems' big band while still a teenager, then she signed with Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer in 1942 as a contract player. Among the radio programs in which she appeared were Beat the Band and The Abbott and Costello Show. Louis B. Mayer, the head of MGM, insisted she change the Marvel part of her real name. She dropped her first name and kept the middle one. Some of her film roles included Lost in a Harem (1944), Champion (1949), The Lemon Drop Kid (1951), New York Confidential (1955) and Rock-A-Bye Baby (1958). The eventual popular Christmas carol \\"Silver Bells\\" made its debut in The Lemon Drop Kid, sung by Maxwell and Hope. Maxwell appeared twice as a singer in the second season (1955‚Äì1956) of The Jimmy Durante Show. ==Personal life== Maxwell married three times; each ended in divorce. In September 1944, she married actor John Conte; the relationship was dissolved in June 1946. Her second marriage to restaurateur Anders McIntyre lasted just over a year from January 1, 1950 until March 23, 1951. Maxwell's six-year marriage to writer/producer Jerry Davis ended in 1960. Her only child, Matthew, was born to Maxwell and Davis in 1956. Maxwell met and became friends with Frank Sinatra when they crossed paths, both of them in separate nationally renowned big bands in the late 1930s. Their friendship continued after Marilyn gave up singing for acting and moved to Hollywood and Frank had moved from New Jersey to Beverly Hills in the early 1940s. By 1945, the friendship had progressed into an extra-marital affair. Frank's then wife Nancy saw Marilyn wearing an expensive diamond bracelet Nancy had earlier seen in Frank's car and assumed was for her. Taking this as evidence of Frank's infidelity, Nancy ordered Marilyn and husband John Conte to immediately leave the Sinatra family Christmas gala of 1945. Confronted after the party by Nancy, Frank admitted to the affair but claimed it was only casual not serious. Soon after, Marilyn and Frank ended their sexual liaison.Frank The Voice\\", James Kaplan published by Anchor Books Nov. 2011. Between 1950 and 1954, Marilyn had an ongoing affair with actor/comedian Bob Hope. Although he was married at the time to singer Dolores Reade Hope, Bob and Marilyn's relationship was so open that many in Hollywood referred to her as Mrs. Bob Hope.Lou Lumenick, \\"Bob Hope Often Cheated During 69 Year Marriage?\\", NY Post, 31 October 2014. During the 1950s, Marilyn became good friends with fellow actor Rock Hudson. After her marriage to Jerry Davis ended in 1960 at the arrangement of Hudson's agent Henry Willson, Marilyn became one of several women Hudson publicly \\"dated\\" to counter rumors (admitted true by him later in life) of the actor's homosexuality. No real romance between Maxwell and Hudson existed.John J O'Connor, \\"The Life, Death and Secrets of Rock Hudson\\", New York Times, 8 January 1990. On March 20, 1972, at age 50, Maxwell was found dead in her home by her 15-year-old son, who had arrived home from school. The cause was an apparent heart attack; she had been treated for hypertension and pulmonary disease. Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Jack Benny were honorary pallbearers at her funeral. ==Radio appearances== {  - ! Year !! Program !!

Lie at the Norwegian Chess Championship at Hamar Kjetil Aleksander Lie (born November 18, 1980 in Porsgrunn) is a Norwegian chess player, and Norway's eighth International Grandmaster (GM). Lie was the Norwegian chess champion in 2009 and 2010. Representing the chess club in Porsgrunn, Lie is the first Norwegian GM not from the Oslo vicinity. Lie started playing scholastic chess at the age of eight. In 1994 he won the Norwegian championship for the cadet age group (14- and 15-year-olds). He won the Open Norwegian Championship in 2000, and finished first in the top age group in the Norwegian Youth Championships every year from 2000 to 2003. In 2002, Lie was awarded the title of International Master. The required three Grandmaster norms came in the Norwegian team chess championship of 2003 to 2004, Politiken Cup in Copenhagen in 2004, and Smartfish Chess Masters in Drammen in December 2004 and January 2005. Even after these norms, Lie had still not achieved the required Elo rating of 2500 until he won the first two rounds in a local tournament in Porsgrunn at the end of February 2005. These wins gave Lie a rating of 2500.5, and it did not matter that Lie immediately proceeded to lose the third game. During the 2007 candidates matches in Elista, Lie served as Magnus Carlsen's second, helping with analysis and preparations. He was praised by Magnus's father for his efforts and humor.Magnus ergrer seg (Magnus is annoyed at himself) Nettavisen, June 4, 2007. Written after Magnus Carlsen was eliminated from the first round. Lie has played on the Norwegian team at the Chess Olympiads between 2000 and 2010. In the 2008 Olympiad in Dresden, Lie's third round win over Bu Xiangzhi secured Norway an upset win over China.Norway upsets China at Chess Olympiad November 15, 2008, retrieved November 16, 2008 Lie secured his first Norwegian chess championship in Bergen 2009 with 6.5/9 points, despite an upset loss to Lasse L√∏vik in the first round. In the 2010 championship, Lie was one of four players to share first place with 6.0/9, the three others being his brother Espen Lie, Joachim Thomassen, and Frode O. O. Urkedal. Later that year, he won the double round- robin play-offs October 14-17 in Stavanger with 4/6. Lie's playing style is aggressive and sacrificial, and he is known as a dangerous tactician. With White, Lie has varied between 1.c4 and 1.e4, with Black he prefers sharp defenses such as the Sicilian Defence and Benoni Defense. ==References*Hansen, Victor \\"F√∏rste stormester fra landet\\".

She is a former Chinese gymnast who is coached by Liu Guicheng and He Hua in Beijing. She admires fellow Chinese gymnast Liu Xuan and Russian gymnast Svetlana Khorkina for the longevity of their involvement in the sport. Fan Ye is best known for her work on the balance beam. Her biggest accomplishment in gymnastics is winning the 2003 World Balance Beam Title. Fan Ye earned a 9.812 for that gold medal performance and has the distinction of having the highest scoring routine at an international elite competition in the 2001-2004 quad. Fan Ye qualified for the Chinese Olympic team in 2004. These games were a disappointment for her since she didn't qualify for the Individual All-Around or event finals. In the team final, she competed in uneven bars and balance beam. She had a disastrous bars routine when her feet hit the bar on her dismount causing her to fall face first.

Fan also had disappointing results at the 2005 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, but that same year, she won the most prestigious competition in China, the Chinese National Games.

The institute trains health care professionals in palliative care and related medical disciplines. Through its connection with Calicut Medical College and other clinics in the state of Kerala, the institute supports between 4,500 and 5,000 patients per week. This institute is an organ of Pain and Palliative Care Society, Medical College, Calicut, which was founded in 1993. ==History== The institute began as an outpatient unit at Government Medical College, Calicut in 1993. In 1999, the Pain and Palliative Care Society established the 'Neighbourhood Network in Palliative Care', aimed at increasing community participation in palliative care. In 2003, the Institute was shifted to a separate building for training, research and patient care. In 2008, this institute was recognized as a WHO collaborating centre in community participation in palliative care. ==Mission== The Pain & Palliative Care Society believes that individuals and families coping with a life-threatening illness deserve efficient access to services that are designed to enhance their quality of life and enable them to receive care in the setting of their choice. ==Services== The outpatient department of Institute of Palliative Medicine receives about 250 patients per week.

It is near Dartford and the Bluewater shopping centre to the west and Gravesend to the east. The station is part of the Thames Gateway urban regeneration, a project of national priority. It stands on the High Speed 1 rail line, around south-west of Northfleet railway station and the Stonebridge Road area of Northfleet. The station lies off the A2 trunk road, about from its junction with the M25 motorway. During the London 2012 Olympics, it served as a primary park-and-rail service as it is very close to the M25 motorway, allowing easy access for over 10 million commuters. Ebbsfleet International is owned by HS1 Ltd, which acquired a 30-year concession to own and operate the High Speed 1 railway and the stations St Pancras railway station, Stratford International, Ebbsfleet International and Ashford International. ==Origin of the name== The name Ebbsfleet is an artificial creation of seventeenth-century antiquaries, partly inspired by the name of Ebbsfleet in Thanet, to the east.Keith Briggs, The two Ebbsfleets in Kent. Journal of the English Place-Name Society 44, 5‚Äì9 ==HistoryOpening=== The station opened to the public on 19 November 2007 for people travelling on Eurostar, later than St Pancras International because the security equipment was transferred from Waterloo International. The station was formally opened to Eurostar and dedicated in a ceremony by Dame Kelly Holmes on 29 January 2008. ===Naming=== \\"Ebbsfleet International Station\\" was the name originally proposed for the station, but \\"Dartford International Station\\" was later proposed at the urging of Eurostar, who felt that Dartford was a name with greater national recognition. Opposition to Eurostar's ‚ÄòDartford International‚Äô proposal came from Gravesham Borough Council, whose administrative centre at Gravesend is just two miles () away (even though Ebbsfleet International is in the borough of Dartford and therefore outside Gravesham council's authority); Southfleet Parish Council; and Swanscombe and Greenhithe Town Council, both in the Borough of Dartford. The similarity of its name to that of Dartford railway station, away, was also of concern. ===Javelin Shuttle=== The Olympic Javelin or Javelin was a high-speed train shuttle service operated by Southeastern over High Speed 1 during the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. The service ran for the duration of both games, between St Pancras International station and this station, via Stratford International station, which is close to the Olympic Park. During the Summer Olympics a service of eight trains an hour ran between St Pancras and Ebbsfleet, calling at Stratford, replacing the usual East Kent highspeed service. Two of these were extended to Ashford and one to Faversham. Between 11pm and 1am the service between St Pancras and Ebbsfleet was increased to twelve per hour. === Eurostar Service Suspension (2020-2022) === On Thursday 3 September 2020, it was announced by Eurostar that due to the ongoing 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, sales were down by 90% and thus both Ebbsfleet and Ashford International stations would not see any Eurostar services until at least 2022. ==Layout== On High Speed 1 there are avoiding lines in each direction and four platforms, two serving international Eurostar services and two the Southeastern High-speed services. Southeastern services travelling between London and the North Kent Line use a junction to the north of the station and are served by another pair of platforms that curve away to the east. Ticket barriers control access to all platforms. ==Access and facilities== This station has bilingual signage, both in French and English. It is one of the relatively few stations in England to have bilingual signage, others being Wallsend (Latin), Southall (Punjabi), Hereford (Welsh), St Pancras and Ashford International (French). ===Parking=== The Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) Act allows a total of 9,000 car parking spaces to be constructed,Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996 Section 9 4b with an initial 6,000 built. The car parks are in a number of areas around the station - north of the North Kent Line, between the North Kent Line and High Speed 1, south of the High Speed 1 and south west of the station building. ===Buses and coaches=== The station is served by Fastrack buses operated by Arriva Southern Counties, which connect it to Dartford, Bluewater, Greenhithe, Swanscombe and Gravesend. Despite being in close proximity to the station, Northfleet has no bus connection to the station. ===Taxis=== There is a taxi rank directly outside the station entrance/exit. Car rental services for both leisure and business are located in the concourse. The interchange facilities lie at either end of the main station box - taxis, buses and set down at the northern end (to also serve the NKL platforms) and coaches to the south of the station box. It was formerly planned that Crossrail would terminate at a separate station between Northfleet and Ebbsfleet International but under the current plan, Abbey Wood further west will be the eastern terminus. However, a Crossrail extension from Abbey Wood to Gravesend (Hoo Junction) remains safeguarded. ===Pedestrian access=== Northfleet railway station is approximately 400 metres to the north-east, although the walking distance between the two stations is significantly longer, approximately 2 km if roadside footpaths are followed. There is a shorter walking route (approximately 1,000 metres) through the car park to the north of Ebbsfleet station, but there are no footpaths provided and this way is obstructed by the car park access barriers. There are no specific pedestrian or cycle route signs for Ebbsfleet station on any of the possible routes between the stations. Gravesham Council acknowledges that the existing provision is inadequate,Gravesham Borough Council Report to Joint Transportation Board: Northfleet ‚Äì Ebbsfleet station pedestrian links.,(see pages 65-69) although it is a complex planning issue to resolve as whilst Northfleet is in Gravesham, Ebbsfleet station is just over the border in the Borough of Dartford, and there are many other stakeholders involved. ==Services== International platform 1 As of the Summer 2014 timetable, there are up to five Eurostar services to Paris on weekdays, four on Saturdays and three on Sundays. Most of these services run non-stop from Ebbsfleet to Paris, though a few also stop at Ashford en route. There are four trains to Brussels on weekdays, three on Saturdays and two on Sundays. All Brussels services call at Lille and some also call at Calais. There is also a single round trip service on most days to Marne-la-Vall√©e for the Disneyland Paris resort, which also calls at Ashford and Lille (in the France-bound direction only). It is not permitted to use Eurostar services for domestic journeys in the UK. Since the station's opening, Eurostar has withheld passenger usage statistics for international services, citing commercial confidentiality. Since the opening of Ebbsfleet station in 2007, Eurostar has transferred a number of trips from Ashford to the newer station. Ashford International has a wider variety of destinations such as Calais, Lille, Brussels, Disneyland Paris, the French Alps, Paris, Lyon, Avignon and Marseille, but with fewer services to them. In contrast, Ebbsfleet International has services to only the core destinations (Paris, Brussels and Lille) and the Disneyland Paris service, but with much more frequent services. On 29 June 2009 Southeastern started a weekday preview service between and Ebbsfleet International, extending to during peak hours. On 7 September the service was enhanced by a few services to Ramsgate via or Dover. A regular service began on 13 December 2009. The typical off-peak service was: * 4 trains per hour to St Pancras International, taking 17 minutes; * 2 trains per hour to Faversham; * 1 train per hour to Margate via Ashford International and Canterbury West; * 1 train per hour to Dover Priory via Ashford International, Folkestone West and Folkestone Central. Additional trains, in peak hours only, serve , via the Medway towns, and . Since 2 January 2015 the off peak service is: * 4 trains per hour to St Pancras International, taking 17 minutes; * 2 trains per hour to Faversham with 1 continuing to Ashford via Ramsgate and Dover; * 1 train per hour to Margate via Ashford International and Canterbury West; * 1 train per hour to Dover Priory via Ashford International, Folkestone Central continuing to Gravesend via Ramsgate and Faversham. The Eurostar services as of May 2019: * 6 trains per day to Paris Gare du Nord * 6 trains per day to Brussels-South, via Lille Europe (some via Ashford International additionally) * 1 train per day to Marne-la-Vallee - Chessy for Disneyland Paris via Ashford International and Lille Europe. ==Gallery== File:Ebbsfleet3709.JPGDepartures (Note: this had the old Eurostar logo) File:Ebbsfleet3716.JPGThe track towards the Medway Viaduct.

It opens into the San Fernando Valley at the northwest and the San Gabriel Valley at the southeast. It is nearly bisected by the Verdugo Wash, a smaller valley separating the Verdugo Mountains from the San Rafael Hills. Most of the valley lies at an elevation of over 1,500 feet (450 m). ==History== Crescenta Valley was a pastoral area under the Rancho Tujunga, Rancho San Rafael and Rancho La Canada land grants during the Spanish and Mexican periods. The first American settler in the valley was Theodore Pickens, who settled at the top of today's Briggs Avenue in 1871. The western portion of Rancho La Canada, which included the major portion of the valley, was subdivided in 1881 into 10-acre parcels by Dr. Benjamin B. Briggs. Significant suburban residential development began with the opening of the Montrose subdivision in 1913, accelerating significantly after World War II. Today, the Crescenta Valley is a mature suburban area. The name \\"Crescenta\\" does not derive from the Spanish word for \\"crescent\\", which is el creciente. Benjamin Briggs coined the name from the English word \\"crescent\\" because he could see three crescent-shaped formations from his home,Gudde, Erwin G. (1998). California Place Names: The Origin and Etymology of Current Geographic Names, 4th ed. Berkeley: University of California Press. or because of the shape of the valley.Dougherty, June (1993).

The post office was established in 1888, with the Post Office adding the \\"La\\" to the name to distinguish it from Crescent City, California. ==Communities== Incorporated cities, districts of Los Angeles, districts of Glendale, and unincorporated census-designated places in the Crescenta Valley include: * City of La Ca√±ada Flintridge * Crescenta Highlands (also known as \\"Glendale Annex\\"): City of Glendale * La Crescenta-Montrose: unincorporated LA county & City of Glendale * Montrose: City of Glendale * Sunland: City of Los Angeles * Tujunga: City of Los Angeles * Verdugo City: City of Glendale ==Weather== Daytime temperatures are generally 10 to 15 ¬∞F (6 to 8 ¬∞C) warmer than those in coastal regions during summer. Winter is somewhat colder than most L.A. area stations. Winter snow is rare, but not unknown on the valley floor. Because of proximity to the mountains, rainfall is generally higher than most Los Angeles area locations, averaging around 20 inches per year, mostly falling between November and March. ==References * Crescenta Valley Chamber of Commerce * Historical Society of Crescenta Valley * Crescenta Valley Weekly Category:Geography of Los Angeles Category:Geography of the San Fernando Valley Category:Geography of the San Gabriel Valley Category:Glendale, California Category:La Ca√±ada Flintridge, California Category:Los Angeles County, California regions Category:San Gabriel Mountains Category:San Rafael Hills Category:Sunland-Tujunga, Los Angeles Category:Valleys of California Category:Valleys of Los Angeles County, California Category:Verdugo Mountains ","title":"Crescenta Valley"},{"id":"2231586","text":"Anyang Halla () is a professional ice hockey team based in Anyang in Gyeonggi- do, South Korea. It is one of the founding and current members of the Asia League Ice Hockey (ALIH). Formed in 1994, it is the oldest professional ice hockey team, and one of only three professional teams, in South Korea. The Halla Group contributes three billion won annually to run the club. At its inception the team was based out of Mok-dong, Seoul and named the Mando Winia. In 1998 the team took the name of Mando's parent company, Halla. After the collapse of the Korean Ice Hockey League in 2003 they were the only team to survive. They joined four Japanese teams to create the new Asia League Ice Hockey. In 2005 the team relocated and took the name of their new hometown as their own, playing all current home games out of the Anyang Sports Complex Arena. After two years of finishing in fifth place, they became the first non- Japanese team to finish first in the regular season in 2008‚Äì09. However, they failed to defeat the Nippon Paper Cranes in the semi-finals. In the following season Halla again finished in first and won the semi-final and final series giving them their first play-off series win and first Asia League Championship. The club captured their second AL title after the league cancelled the championship final due to the earthquake in Japan. Asia League announced Halla and Tohoku Free Blades as the co-champions. == Team history  1994‚Äì2003: pre-Asia League Ice Hockey === The team was founded in 1994 by the Halla Group to help promote hockey in Korea. The Halla Group also felt that by creating an ice hockey team, it would help them to fulfill their role as a responsible corporation by providing something to the community. The team was originally named \\"Mando Winia\\". It was so named because Mando is a subsidiary company of Halla and Winia is a brand of air conditioner sold by the company. In 1997 the team was disbanded for a short time during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. However, the chairman of Halla Group, Chung Mong-won, fought to keep the team. As a member of the Korean Ice Hockey League the team won the championship five times. During this time, the team also changed their name from \\"Mando Winia\\" to \\"Halla Winia\\". The team first looked at adding foreign players to their roster in late 2001 with other members of the Korean League. In 2003, the team was one of the founding members of Asia League Ice Hockey. === 2003‚Äìpresent: Asia League Ice Hockey === While the team participates primarily in the Asia League, they also play in tournaments like the All Korea Ice Hockey Championship each year. In the inaugural year of Asia League Ice Hockey, Halla played a shortened seasons of only 16 games, and failed to break .500. In the following year they brought Esa Tikkanen, a veteran player of 20 NHL seasons, on board. He was brought on primarily to coach the players but he also played during the team's games. Tikkanen felt that as the players played against more skilled teams their own skill level showed greater improvement. He also felt that they should play more games and that the season was too short. That year the team was also noted for showing great improvement over the first year's effort. Halla finished the season winning 18 games out of 42 with 5 ties. Their top offensive player, Marco Poulsen, finished fifth in the overall points race, however they did not reach their goal that year of making the playoffs, finishing in fifth place one spot out of the playoffs. In the off-season the team changed their name from Anyang Halla Winia to Anyang Halla with the expiration of the sponsorship contract. As well they hired Otakar Vejvoda to be the team's new coach. Vejvoda was considered a legend in the Czech Extraliga both for his skill as a player and a coach. In the 2005‚Äì06 season Halla improved on the previous year's performance finishing in second place. The league saw a reduced season of only 38 games. Song Dong-hwan was the leader in goals for the league with 31 and Patrik Martinec ranked second in assists with 44. Martinec ranked number two on the total points list while Song finished in fourth place. Halla also scored the most short-handed goals of any team in the league with 11. The city of Anyang won an award for being \\"The best Hockey Town in Asia\\". The team made the play-offs for the first time since the league's formation. They received a bye in the first round and played Kokudo, the winner of the third place and sixth place match-up. Anyang won only a single game out of the first three which were played on home ice. They were eliminated in the fourth game which was played in Kokudo's home rink by a score of 5‚Äì1. Kokudo went on to be the league champions for the second year in a row. After the conclusion of the 2005‚Äì06 season there were some roster changes. Two of the team's top players, Song Dong-hwan and Jang Jong-moon, had to report for compulsory military service. Starting goaltender, Kim Sung-Bae, retired after the previous season. Even though they were missing these players they were noted for having more players with more than 10 goals and 10 assists than in the previous season. With the departure of Song offensive output dropped slightly, the team's top offensive player finished seventh overall in goals with 21. However Martinec won the assists race with 53 and the overall points total with 71. The team shared top spot in the short-handed goals with 2 other teams, scoring 10 over the course of the season. With a further shortened season of only 34 games the team finished in fifth place and faced the other Korean team, Kangwon Land in the quarter finals. During the regular season Kangwon won six of seven meetings, and the quarter finals were no different. Kangwon swept Halla in three games, the final game ending in 3‚Äì2 with a last minute desperate bid by Halla to tie the game. Anyang Halla pose for a celebratory photo after defeating High1 on 25 January 2009 The next season saw the AL further reduce the number of games played to just 30. In the pre-season Halla won the Anyang Cup, which is a pre-season tournament held in Anyang. The team's record in the regular season remained relatively the same and they finished again in fifth place. Lee Yu-Won was the top offensive player with 16 goals and was tied for fourth place with three other players. Martinec continued to contribute many assists to the team and finished in second place with 29, one point off first. He finished in fourth place in the overall point totals. Halla did not have another player in the top 10. The team once again led the league in short- handed goals and gave up the fewest short-handed goals against along with the Oji Eagles. In the playoffs the Halla faced the Nippon Paper Cranes in the first round. During the regular season the two teams split their series, each winning two games. The playoffs told a different story, and Nippon swept Halla in three games. Halla lost each game by a single goal. Vejvoda praised Nippon's goalie for his excellent play and commended his players for their effort. Following the defeat in the post-season Halla replaced Vejvoda as head coach with Shim Eui-Sik. Shim had spent his entire professional career playing for Halla and during the 2007‚Äì2008 season he was the coach of Little Halla. As a player Shim had 30 points in 80 games. He vowed to reorganize the team and set his sights on a league championship. The team's general manager also hired Samuel H. Kim, then an analyst for SBS Sports and previously an NHL reporter from Vancouver, as a scout for the organization. Halla moved away from the heavy Czech influence which had previously dominated the team and filled three of the four spots for foreign players on the team with players from North America. Brock Radunske, Brad Fast and Jon Awe became the first three players from North America to play for the team. They also arranged for Eric Thurston, the head coach of University of Alberta's team, to spend the first three weeks of the training camp assisting the new coach and new North American players. Martinec was the only Czech player to remain on the team. In addition to the new foreigner players, Song Dong-hwan and Jang Jong-moon returned from military service. In the 2008 pre-season Anyang Cup, Halla finished fourth out of five teams. The AL increased the number of regular season games for the 2008‚Äì09 season to 36. In September head coach Shim was suspended for five games for refusal to play. The incident stemmed from a goal that was scored as the final buzzer sounded during a 21 September game against High1. Halla entered the dressing room and refused to return to the ice. The league considered the game a forfeit. Anyang Halla finished the season in first place with a total of 76 points. Their defeat of their rivals High1 in the final game of the season marks the first time a non-Japanese team had finished first place in the Asia League. Brock Radunske captured the titles for both the most goals scored with 29 and most points on the season with 57. Martinec finished in second place for the second year in a row in the assists category with 47. Overall the team finished with five players in the top ten in the overall points tally. For the first time the team ended the season with the number one powerplay scoring 54 goals. In contrast to earlier seasons the team did not lead the league in short-handed goals, ranking in the middle of the pack both in goals for and against. They were the only team not shutout during the regular season. After receiving a bye in the first round of the play-offs Halla had to face the Nippon Paper Cranes in the semi-final. They returned to Anyang for game six of the series leading 3‚Äì2. They were expected to win the series but Nippon's Ilmura scored two game-winning goals and the Japanese club defeated Anyang in 7 games. Halla opened the 2009‚Äì10 season with a loss on home ice, but at the midpoint of the season they were tied for first place with the Oji Eagles. The league maintained the number of games at 36. The first half of the season saw Halla plagued with injuries. Particularly hard hit were the team's foreign imports. After the third game of the season Jon Awe was diagnosed with a sports hernia that required surgery and was scheduled to miss 8‚Äì12 weeks. On 29 November, Brad Fast received a knee injury that would sideline him for 4‚Äì6 months, ending his season. Brock Radunske was also on the injury list with a concussion, while Patrik Martinec was day to day with a lower-body injury. Halla replaced Awe quickly with Dustin Wood, who has played in both the American Hockey League and Deutsche Eishockey Liga. Fast was replaced by Lee Don-ku from Yonsei University. Halla also had several other regular players injured including Kim Won-jun, Kim Kyu-hun, and Lee Seung-yup. After 18 games Halla led the league with 94 goals. On 31 January 2010 Halla defeated the Oji Eagles in overtime by a score of 4‚Äì3, clinching first place for the second year in a row. The win also set up a semi-final match-up against Korean rivals High1, guaranteeing that a Korean team would appear in the final for the first time in league history. Halla won all of their series against opposing teams, except against their rival High1. Of 18 possible points available in their six-game series, Halla took only eight. They were the only team to win a series against the Nippon Paper Cranes. The team led the league in goals scored with 180. Individually, Kim Ki-sung led the team in goals scored with 22, while Patrik Martinec again led with 40 assists and 51 points. Halla finished with five players in the top ten point list. The team also led in both powerplay goals for, with 57, powerplay percentage, with 34.97%, and shorthanded goals for, with 10. In the annual end of season awards, Patrik Martinec took the award for Most Valuable Player and Best Playmaking. Cho Min-ho took the award for Young Guy of the Year. Anyang city won the award for Best Hockey Town for the second time for their spirit and sell-out crowds. Anyang Halla defeated High1 by a score of 5‚Äì2 to win the semi-finals three games to one, winning their first play-off series and becoming the first Korean team to play for the Championship Cup. Halla faced the Cranes, who had knocked them out of the playoffs twice, in the final. The series went to the full five games and four of the games went to overtime. Brock Radunske scored two overtime winners and assisted Kim Woo-Jae in scoring the overtime winner in game five, making Halla the first non-Japanese team to win the Asia League Championship. Radunske was named MVP while head coach Shim was named \\"Coach of the Year\\". After retiring as a player, Martinec signed a 1-year deal to work as an assistant coach on the team. Halla defeated the Oji Eagles in the fourth game of the first round of the 2010‚Äì2011 play-offs to advance.Like the previous season, Halla lost the opening game against High1. However, they once again found themselves on top at the midpoint of the season. The team was second in the league in goals scored with 65. Halla retained Dustin Wood who was brought in as a replacement in the previous season. On 14 November 2010 the team defended their Korea Domestic Championship title against High1 by defeating them 5‚Äì1 in the final game of the week-long tournament. After finishing first two consecutive years, Halla finished in fourth place one point behind the Free Blades. They won their season series against all teams except the Cranes and Eagles. They also finished fifth in goals scored with 130, one behind High1, but allowed the second fewest goals with 94, three behind the Eagles. While the team's penalty kill was ranked fifth in the league, they were tied for the most short-handed goals with the Cranes with six goals. Their powerplay was ranked third, and they gave up the second fewest short-handed goals. Brock Radunske led the team with 20 goals and finished fourth in the league. Cho Min-ho also made the top ten ranking and finished in eight place with 18 goals. Kim Ki-sung was the only Halla player to make the top ten in assists and finished in tenth place with 27. Overall Cho Min-ho led the team with 44 points and finished ninth in the league. Dustin Wood led the team in penalty minutes with 45. With their fourth-place finish, Halla had to face the Eagles in the first round of the playoffs. The series began in Japan, but Halla took two of three games and upon returning to South Korea they won the fourth game of the best-of-five series and knocked the Eagles out. The Free Blades defeated the Cranes and Halla were set to face them on 12 March 2011 in Sendai, Japan. However, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck the Sendai area about one hour after the team landed there to prepare for the games. The League immediately cancelled the three games scheduled in Sendai and on 22 March 2011 they officially cancelled the final series, award co-championship titles to both Anyang Halla and Tohoku Free Blades. This decision made Halla only the second team to capture back-to- back championships since the league's inception. == Community contributions == As a team and organization the Halla have engaged in charitable work. In 2008 they had two charity games on 27 and 28 December. The admission fee was waved and instead fans were asked to make donations. The proceeds were donated to the poor children of Anyang city as well as the sick children's hospital. On 19 December 2009 The Anyang Halla organization donated 20,000 won for each goal that had been scored in the season to charity, totaling just over 2 million won. On 25 and 26 December 2010 Halla repeated their charity game series, and offered free admission to the game in exchange for donations to the sick children's hospitals in Gyeonggi Province. After the cancellation of the final series, the team held a charity game on 22 March 2011 to raise money for the Japanese earthquake victims. Instead of raising a trophy to celebrate their championship, the team took a final photo holding signs of sympathy and encouragement for Japan. The team raised almost 20 million won in donations for Japan. The team maintains a yearly tradition of giving free admission to students who take the College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) to promote rest and comfort after the difficult exam. == Media == The Anyang Halla Hockey Club launched a new radio broadcast deal in 2007 with Afreeca.com. On 11 May 2009, SBSsports acquired a 5-year broadcast contract with the club. == Arena == Anyang Ice Arena in 2018 The Anyang Sports Complex Ice Arena () was opened on 24 November 2000. It seats 1,284 spectators. The Arena also contains a basketball court and is home to the Anyang KGC. It has a seating for 6,690 people. The ice rink is also used for short track and figure skating among other sports. The team previously used the Mok-dong Ice Rink. == Team colors and mascots  Logo === The Anyang Halla logo features a black triangle in the background surrounded by a white and black border. A growling polar bear is shown protruding from the top half of the triangle and underneath the team name \\"Halla\\" is shown in stylized gold letters. Below the team name is a semicircular shape which contains the city name \\"Anyang\\" in white letters on a blue background. === Jerseys === As the team changed its name from the Winia to the Halla the uniforms had minor changes made to them. The logo changed names and the uniforms had colored shoulders removed from them. The current home jerseys feature a solid blue background with yellow stripes on the cuffs and bottom of the body as well as a number of blue rough shapes behind the gold trim as well as sponsor logos on the shoulders. The away jerseys feature a solid white background with dark blue striped borders on the cuffs and bottom of the body, it also contains the same rough blue shapes behind the trim. The Halla put the first name of Korean players on the jerseys to avoid confusion as several players share the same family name. === Mascots === The teams mascots are a male and female polar bear. The male polar bear wears the Halla home jersey and the female polar bear wears the away jersey. She also wears a white skirt and has red eyes. No name has been released for either of the polar bears. In February 2012 the team began an event to choose a name for the male mascot with the name to be announced at the end of the season. == Honours == *Korean Ice Hockey League: ::Winners (5): 1997‚Äì98, 1999‚Äì2000, 2001‚Äì02, 2002‚Äì03, 2003‚Äì04 *Korea Domestic Championship: ::Winners (9): 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2005, 2009, 2010, 2014, 2016 *Asia League Ice Hockey: ::Regular season winners (5): 2008‚Äì09, 2009‚Äì10, 2014‚Äì15, 2015‚Äì16, 2016‚Äì17 ::Championship winners (5): 2009‚Äì10, 2010‚Äì11, 2015‚Äì16, 2016‚Äì17, 2017‚Äì18 a: Shared with Tohoku Free Blades. ==Team records== As of the 2018‚Äì19 season.

It was formerly the home of Arthur Acton and later of his son Harold Acton, on whose death in 1994 it was bequeathed to New York University. The villa is now home to NYU Florence. ==History== Villa La Pietra was bought and somewhat modified in the 1460s by the Florentine banker Francesco Sassetti. In 1545 or 1546 it was sold to the . The villa was given its present form in the seventeenth century by the cardinal Luigi Capponi, possibly with the assistance of Carlo Fontana. During the brief period from 1865 to 1871 when Florence was capital of the Kingdom of Italy, the villa was used as the embassy of Prussia. In 1903 Arthur Acton, an Anglo-Neapolitan art dealer, rented it after his marriage to Hortense Mitchell, the daughter of a banker from Chicago, Illinois, William Mitchell. With money from her family, the couple bought the villa in 1907. The villa contains the art collection assembled by the Actons, which reflects twentieth-century Anglo-American taste. It is used for didactic purposes by New York University. The collection includes works from the circle of Giotto, Romanesque sculptures, a relief of the Virgin and Child by Donatello, and fifteenth-century tapestries made for the de' Medici family. Between 1905 and 1930 the gardens of the villa were substantially altered by the Actons, only the walled lemon garden to the north-west of the villa remaining mostly unchanged since the time of Luigi Capponi. The Actons laid out a formal Baroque Italian garden with extensive stonework, including almost two hundred statues, many of them by the Venetian sculptors Orazio Marinali and Antonio Bonazza, brought to Florence from the villas of the Brenta. The gardens were restored in the early years of the twenty-first century. == References  * Category:Houses completed in the 15th century La Pietra Pietra Category:Landscape design history of Italy Category:New York University Category:Renaissance architecture in Florence La Pietra Category:Historic house museums ","title":"Villa La Pietra"},{"id":"2231598","text":"Sophie Charlotte may refer to: * Sophie Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel (1678‚Äì1749), princess of Hesse-Kassel * Charlotte Christine of Brunswick-L√ºneburg (1694‚Äì1715), German duchess * Princess Charlotte Sophie of Saxe-Coburg- Saalfeld (1731‚Äì1810), German duchess * Duchess Sophie Charlotte in Bavaria (1847‚Äì1897), Duchess of Alen√ßon and born Duchess in Bavaria * Sophie Charlotte (actres98s) (born 1989), Brazilian actress *the name Sophie-charlotte, is also a important name in the philosophical sense of the word.

Piper excelsum is found in both New Zealand and the Society Islands (Tahiti). ==Description== Kawakawa is found throughout the North Island, and as far south as Okarito (43.20 ¬∞S) on the West Coast, and Banks Peninsula (43.5 ¬∞S) on the east coast of the South Island. The leaves are often covered with holes caused by the caterpillar of the kawakawa looper moth (Cleora scriptaria). The images depict the variety majus which has larger and more glossy leaves than P. excelsum. The name kawakawa comes from the MƒÅori language, where it refers to the bitter taste of the leaves, from kawa or bitter. ===Leaves=== Kawakawa leaves are about 5‚Äì10 cm long by 6‚Äì12 cm wide; they are opposite to each other, broadly rounded with a short drawn-out tip and are heart-shaped at their bases. The leaves are deep green in colour if growing in the forest, but may be yellowish-green in more open situations. ===Flowers=== The flowers are produced on greenish, erect spikes 2.5‚Äì7.5 cm long. Kawakawa flowers are quite minute and very closely placed around the spike. After pollination the flowers gradually swell and become fleshy to form small, berry-like fruits that are yellow to bright orange. ===Berries=== Each berry cluster is the size of a small finger. Ripening period is January and February. These fruits are favoured by kerer≈´ or New Zealand pigeon (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae) and tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae). ==Uses== Kawakawa is a traditional medicinal plant of the MƒÅori.\\"Macropiper excelsum. Kawakawa\\" , NgƒÅ Tipu Whakaoranga - MƒÅori Plant Use Database, Landcareresearch.co.nz An infusion is made from the leaves or roots, and used for bladder problems, boils, bruises, to relieve pain or toothache, or as a general tonic. The sweet edible yellow berries (most often found in summer on female trees) of the plant were eaten as a diuretic. It also is important in cultural contexts: host people of a marae wave leaves of kawakawa to welcome guests. At a tangi, both hosts and guests may wear wreaths of kawakawa on the head as a sign of mourning.\\"Tangihanga ‚Äì death customs\\", Te Ara It is commonly grown as an ornamental plant in gardens.New Zealand Plant Conservation Network: Piper excelsum subsp. excelsum ==Relationship with kava== Kawakawa is sometimes called \\"MƒÅori kava\\" and is often confused with the kava plant (Piper methysticum). While the two plants look similar and have similar names, they are different, albeit related, species. Kava is a traditional plant and beverage of the South Pacific. The roots of the plant are used to produce a drink with medicinal, sedative, anesthetic, euphoriant, and entheogenic properties. It is most likely not a coincidence that this plant has a similar name to kawakawa. One source stated: \\"In New Zealand, where the climate is too cold for kava, the Maori gave the name kawa-kawa to another Piperaceae, M. excelsum, in memory of the kava plants they undoubtedly brought with them and unsuccessfully attempted to cultivate.

The Tour began in Fromentine with an individual time trial on 2 July and Stage 11 occurred on 13 July with a mountainous stage to Brian√ßon. The race finished on the Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris, on 24 July. ==Stage 1== 2 July 2005 ‚Äî Fromentine to Noirmoutier- en-l'√éle, (ITT) The winning time of David Zabriskie was set early in the day - so early, in fact, that virtually none of the TV stations covering the Tour actually showed it. Zabriskie, who has also won a stage in the Vuelta a Espa√±a and a time trial in the Giro d'Italia, put a powerful time in that few could approach. The best attempt was a run by Alexander Vinokourov, a teammate of Jan Ullrich, who came in 53 seconds back, putting him, for a time, in second place. Most of the other big names rode respectably, as with Landis, though Iban Mayo wound up four minutes behind the other GC contenders - a disappointment to be sure. Also disappointing was Joseba Beloki, who demonstrated that he has not returned to the form he had before his crash in the 2003 Tour. The big names this Tour, though, were expected to be Ivan Basso, Jan Ullrich, and, of course, Lance Armstrong - the final three starters. Basso performed respectably, coming in 18th, 1:53 back from Zabriskie - a perfectly respectable showing for someone who is not known as a time trialist. Ullrich also did well in 12th place, 1:12 back, especially considering that the day before he got into a gruesome crash with his team car in which he shattered the rear window as he flew through it. The real story, though, was Lance Armstrong, whose time trialing skills this year had been in doubt after a poor showing in the Tour de Georgia. After a small mishap where his foot fell out of the pedal at the start, he rode an incredible time trial, bridging the one-minute gap to Jan Ullrich with 3 km remaining. He finished two seconds behind Zabriskie, sending a clear message to anyone who thought he might be off form this year. As for the other jerseys, Zabriskie won the first green sprinter's jersey, while the winner of the previous year's prologue, Swiss Fabian Cancellara, got the white young rider's jersey. { Stage 1 result and general classification after stage 1 {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rider ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Time -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1  Yellow jersey Green jersey   style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  ~~2~~  ~~~~ ~~~~ style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  ~~\\\\+ 2\\"~~ -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  3    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 53\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  4    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 57\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  5    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 59\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  6    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 02\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  7  White jersey   style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  8    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 04\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  9  Illes Balears  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 05\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10  Liberty Seguros-W√ºrth  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 06\\" } } == Stage 2== 3 July 2005 ‚Äî Challans to Les Essarts, A textbook Tour day - an early break of L√°szl√≥ Bodrogi (Cr√©dit Agricole), David Ca√±ada (Saunier Duval-Prodir), Thomas Voeckler (Bouygues T√©l√©com), and Sylvain Calzati (Ag2r-Prevoyance) got away and was caught at the end. This led to a bunch sprint, with a strangely lackluster McEwen holding on for third as a rock-solid Tom Boonen blasted to his 15th win of the year, and to the green jersey, which he claimed from Zabriskie, although today, in a rare occurrence, Lance Armstrong was wearing it, since Zabriskie also had the yellow jersey, which meant the green went \\"on loan\\" to Armstrong, who was second. Bodrogi racked up enough time bonuses on the intermediate sprints to pass Vinokourov in the standings for third place, 47 seconds behind Zabriskie, who held his yellow jersey. All but three of the riders finished in the peloton, making time bonuses the only things that shuffled the standings at all. In the last kilometres, the main group broke, and most of the General Classification contenders (except Jan Ullrich) came in nine seconds after Boonen. The break-up, however, was caused by a fall, and the judges applied the same time to them as the first group. The real stand- out story of the day was Thomas Voeckler, who masterfully attacked on the small category 4 climb to win the small number of points in the mountain competition that were up for the day. Since those were the only mountain points around, though, Voeckler managed to put himself in polka dots, meaning the young French rider has now worn three of the four leader jerseys in the Tour de France in his career. { Stage 2 result {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rider ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Time -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1  Quick-Step  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2    style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  3    style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  4    style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  5    style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  6    style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  7    style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  8    style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  9    style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10  Liberty Seguros- W√ºrth  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. }  General classification after stage 2 {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rider ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Time -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1  Yellow jersey   style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  ~~2~~  ~~~~ ~~~~ style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  ~~\\\\+ 2\\"~~ -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  3    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 47\\" -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  4    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 53\\" -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  5    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 57\\" -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  6    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 59\\" -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  7    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 02\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  8    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  9    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 04\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10  Illes Balears  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 05\\" } } ==Stage 3== 4 July 2005 ‚Äî La Ch√¢taigneraie to Tours, A normal day with some minor drama at the finish, the early break this time consisted of Erik Dekker (Rabobank), Rubens Bertogliati (Saunier Duval), and Nicolas Portal (AG2R), who were caught 1 km from the end. Dekker had already managed a great feat at Tours the previous season by holding off the peloton after being in a breakaway for 200 kilometres, and winning the Paris-Tours. This time, however, the French city did not bring luck to the Dutchman. After the breakaways were reeled in, the Swiss time trial champion Fabian Cancellara attempted an escape in the last kilometer, but was brought back, leading to a bunch sprint. Commentators expected that the long, straight drive to the finish would favour Robbie McEwen, but instead it was Tom Boonen who took a convincing win. At the finish line Robbie McEwen was reprimanded for trying to push Stuart O'Grady away with his head, a move possibly spurred on by O'Grady preventing him from attacking Boonen by blocking his path. Although McEwen crossed the line third, the judges knocked him to the back of the main pack, giving him a place of 186th, and dealing quite a blow to his hopes of a fourth green jersey, placing him 44 points behind Tom Boonen, who has 70. The general classification remained unchanged, and Cancellara held his young rider's jersey, although if Tom Boonen gets another stage win time bonus, it would go to him. Meanwhile, the early break crossed two of the three category four climbs first, giving Dekker six mountain points. Voeckler could only manage to cross an early climb in second, giving him two more and bringing him up to five, putting Erik Dekker in polka dots. Dekker also won the prize of most combative rider. { Stage 3 result {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rider ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Time -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1  Quick-Step  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  3    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  4    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  5  Liberty Seguros-W√ºrth  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  6    style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  7    style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  8    style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  9    style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10    style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  s.t. }  General classification after stage 3 {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rider ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Time -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1  Yellow jersey   style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  ~~2~~  ~~~~ ~~~~ style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  ~~\\\\+ 2\\"~~ -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  3    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 47\\" -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  4    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 53\\" -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  5    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 57\\" -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  6    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 02\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  7    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  8    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 04\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  9  Illes Balears  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 05\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10  Liberty Seguros-W√ºrth  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 06\\" } } ==Stage 4== 5 July 2005 ‚Äî Tours to Blois, (TTT) This was a nail-biter of a team time trial in which the teams of the three favorites - Armstrong, Ullrich, and Basso - all did well. Discovery trailed CSC in the team standings, and so launched second to last, but showed their usual team time trial form with a pencil-straight line, each member taking pulls like clockwork. As the time trial wore on, Armstrong began taking longer pulls at the front, bringing the pace of the pack up dramatically. Even still, CSC, launching behind them, kept a grueling pace of their own, actually leading Discovery through all of the checkpoints. The race wasn't decided until the last kilometer and a half, when yellow jersey David Zabriskie crashed as his knee hit the handlebar, probably because of his cycle chain malfunctioning. He got back on and crossed the line in a blood-stained yellow jersey 1'28\\" behind the Discovery riders. On the other hand, Ullrich, whose T-Mobile Team crossed the line at 35\\", lost only 30\\" due to the adjusted gap for the team trial stage. He's currently in 14th place, 1'36\\" off Armstrong. Had Zabriskie held on another half a kilometer he would have gotten the same time as the rest of CSC, but instead he dropped to ninth in the overall standings, and CSC's surprise at the yellow jersey hitting the pavement in front of them cost them two seconds on Discovery - coincidentally, the exact margin by which Zabriskie had led Armstrong going into the stage. The result was to put Armstrong in his 67th yellow jersey, and to put teammate Yaroslav Popovych in the white jersey. With no sprints or mountains, the green and polka dot jerseys remained on the shoulders of Tom Boonen and Erik Dekker, respectively. { Stage 4 result {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Time ! -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1   style=\\"text-align:right;\\"   style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2   style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 2\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  3   style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 35\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 30\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  4 Liberty Seguros-W√ºrth  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  + 53\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 40\\" -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  5   style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 31\\"  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  + 50\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  6   style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  + 1' 41\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 00\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  7 Illes Balears  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 2' 05\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 10\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  8   style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t.  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 20\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  9   style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 2' 19\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 30\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10   style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 2' 26\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 40\\" }  General classification after stage 4 {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rider ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Time -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  ~~1~~  ~~~~Yellow jersey  ~~~~ style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  ~~~~-  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 55\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  3    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 04\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  4    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 07\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  5    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 14\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  6    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 16\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  7    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 21\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  8    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 26\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  9    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. } } ;Notes * This means that even though the team finished with a longer time, the provision set forth in the Tour de France Guideline states that the gaps for the team trial stage is capped according to the relative finishing position of the teams. Thus, even though Gerolsteiner and Illes Balears-Caisse D'Epargne finished at the same time, for the riders in those two teams, IBC riders have a 10\\" advantage over the GST riders for the individual classifications. ==Stage 5== 6 July 2005 ‚Äî Chambord to Montargis, Juan Antonio Flecha made an early break, and was joined 90 km later by L√°szl√≥ Bodrogi (Cr√©dit Agricole), Salvatore Commesso (Lampre), and Kjell Carlstr√∂m (Liquigas), but not by George Hincapie, whose team had earlier said they wanted to put him into a break to give him a turn in yellow. The break was finally reeled in 10 km from the finish by a Discovery-led peloton, setting up the sprint. It was a tough, uphill sprint, and McEwen took it by a wheel over Tom Boonen, taking his first win of the Tour, but still only putting him in fourth for the green jersey due to his being relegated to 186th in the third stage. David Zabriskie recovered enough from his crash to start today, and finished with the peloton in 176th place. Out of respect for the role his crash played in the overall standings, Lance Armstrong initially refused to wear the yellow jersey today, and it was not until the race was stopped as it was rolling out of the neutral zone so that the organizers would ask him to wear it that he agreed to. Today also saw the first withdrawal of the Tour as Constantino Zaballa of Saunier Duval-Prodir failed to finish the stage. The Yellow, Green, Polka and White jerseys remain on their respective riders. { Stage 5 result {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rider ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Time -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2  Quick-Step  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  3    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  4    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  5    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  6  Liberty Seguros-W√ºrth  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  7    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  8    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  9    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. }  General classification after stage 5 {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rider ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Time -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  ~~1~~  ~~~~Yellow jersey  ~~~~ style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  ~~~~-  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  2    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 55\\" -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  3    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 04\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  4    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 07\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  5    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 14\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  6    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 16\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  7    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 21\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  8    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 26\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  9    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. } } ==Stage 6== 7 July 2005 ‚Äî Troyes to Nancy, An early escape initiated by Christophe Mengin (Fran√ßaise des Jeux) after 24 km was accompanied by Karsten Kroon (Rabobank), Jaan Kirsipuu (Cr√©dit Agricole), Mauro Gerosa (Liquigas- Bianchi) and St√©phane Aug√© (Cofidis). Karsten Kroon and St√©phane Aug√© took 7 mountain points each, with Kroon winning the last mountain, which results in the Dutch rider wearing the polka dot jersey, keeping it in team Rabobank. Around 10 km from the finish, the breakaway was broken in pieces after an attack of Estonian champion Kirsipuu, but Mengin, a rider local to Nancy, managed to hold on and left Kirsipuu behind. One and a half kilometers from the end, Alexander Vinokourov and Lorenzo Bernucci came off the peloton to join him, and then, 700 meters from the end, Mengin risked too much, slid out and crashed, followed independently by much of the front of the peloton. The result was to give Bernucci the stage, due mostly to his superior navigation of the crash, and Vinokourov a 19-second boost in the general classification. Boonen kept the green jersey, but Hushovd's fifth-place finish gave him a substantial boost, putting him just 7 points back in that competition.

It was Fabian Wegmann who attacked very early and gathered all the mountain points available before the peloton began his pursuit. Even though the main field flew through the French countryside propelled by Quick Step and Davitamon-Lotto, Wegmann managed to enter Germany ahead of the group, but he was eventually reeled in. This time it was Tom Boonen who sprinted too early, and he gave Robbie McEwen the chance of a second stage win in this year's Tour de France. Wegmann had gathered enough points to make him leader of the mountain's classification and receive the polka-dot jersey on the podium in front of the German public. { Stage 7 result {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rider ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Time -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  3    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  4    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  5    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  6    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  7  Quick-Step  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  8    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  9    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. }  General classification after stage 7 {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rider ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Time -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  ~~1~~  ~~~~Yellow jersey  ~~~~ style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  ~~~~-  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 55\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  3    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 02\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  4    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 04\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  5    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 07\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  6    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 14\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  7    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 16\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  8    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 26\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  9    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 32\\" } } ==Stage 8== 9 July 2005 ‚Äî Pforzheim to G√©rardmer, Stage 8, start line. Stage 8 is a stage that takes the riders from Germany back into French territory. Overnight saw two riders drop out of the race, which meant at the day's start there were 183 riders still in the race. The day's stage saw four cat-3 climbs at the beginning of the stage and the first cat-2 climb of this year's race towards the end of the stage. In between the last cat-3 and the cat-2 climb the stage was relatively flat, which was supposed to benefit the sprinters more than the climbers. Early during the race, the peloton moved at a rapid pace, causing a number of riders to drop from the main peloton. Early attacks were mostly caught, save for a group of seven riders which maintained lead towards the end. A group determined to catch the riders was attacked by Vinokourov, followed by Savoldelli; when the Italian cracked and Armstrong was left alone, the chase group with about 32 people was formed, including Ullrich, Voigt, Basso, and McGee. Taking advantage of Armstrong's solitude, another member of , Andreas Kl√∂den, attacked and escaped, reaching the last remaining member of the breakaway. Towards the summit of the cat-2 climb, Weening and Kl√∂den had a 17\\" lead over the chase group, and they were able to maintain the lead over the group when they crossed the finish line. Because Weening and Kl√∂den crossed the line at virtually the same time, the jury had to use the sensor system to determine the winner. Weening was declared the stage winner, beating out Kl√∂den by 0.0002 of a second, or 9.6 millimeters. At the stage's end, Armstrong still holds the yellow jersey, although there was a lot of movement at the top 10 of the classement g√©n√©ral. Popovych, the white jersey holder, was dropped out of the chase group and as a consequence fell out of top 10 and relinquished the white jersey to Karpets, who leads the youth classification by 1\\". The polka dot jersey also changed owner, as Rasmussen took 32 points out of a maximum 36 in this stage. Stage 1 winner David Zabriskie was dropped on the first climb, finished the stage in last place (51'12\\" off the leader) and barely escaped the fate of DNF. Furthermore, Armstrong was isolated from his team, because none of his team-mates was able to follow the attacks in the group of the favourites, mainly the attacks of Vinokourov. { Stage 8 result {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rider ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Time -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  3  Illes Balears  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 27\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  4    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  5    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  6    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  7    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  8    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  9    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. }  General classification after stage 8 {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rider ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Time -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  ~~1~~  ~~~~Yellow jersey  ~~~~ style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  ~~~~-  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  2    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 00\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  3    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 02\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  4    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 07\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  5    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 26\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  6    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 36\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  7    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  8    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 47\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  9    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 50\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. } } ==Stage 9== 10 July 2005 ‚Äî G√©rardmer to Mulhouse, This stage featured three cat-3 mountains followed by the cat-2 Grand Ballon, cat-3 and finally the cat-1 climb up the Ballon d'Alsace, first crossed in the 1905 Tour de France. The terrain was designed so the challengers of the polka dot jersey had to make a move. From the beginning of the stage there were attacks. A group of riders managed to escape the peloton. Michael Rasmussen was a part of this group in the beginning and according to the team he lost two minutes on the previous stage on purpose so that he wouldn't be a threat to the general classification and then would be able to do this attack in order to take mountain points, his main aim for this Tour. Rasmussen and Dario Cioni very quickly escaped the original group and carried on as a duo. Cioni had trouble following Rasmussen over the mountains and eventually gave up. Meanwhile, the original breakout group was reduced to Christophe Moreau and Jens Voigt. Moreau was a contender for the polka dot jersey and Voigt was in position for the yellow jersey, so they both had an interest in chasing Rasmussen. He however kept the distance even though he had been riding alone for almost the entire stage and won the stage. Moreau and Voigt came in three minutes later, which gave Voigt the yellow jersey. { Stage 9 result {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rider ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Time -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 3' 04\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  3    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  4    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 6' 04\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  5    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  6    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  7    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  8    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  9    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. }  General classification after stage 9 {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rider ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Time -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1  Yellow jersey   style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 50\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  3  ~~~~ ~~~~ style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  ~~\\\\+ 2' 18\\"~~ -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  4    style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  + 2' 43\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  5    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 3' 20\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  6    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 3' 25\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  7    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 3' 44\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  8    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 3' 54\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  9    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 4' 05\\" } } ==Stage 10== 12 July 2005 ‚Äî Grenoble to Courchevel, The start of the stage was delayed by as much as 40 minutes because of a protest staged by farmers who were angry over wolves being reintroduced to the Alps. Even though had shown some signs of weakness in the stage won by Weening, it was the American team which lead the peloton in pursuit of a breakaway which contained √ìscar Pereiro, J√∂rg Jaksche and some other riders. Even though most of Discovery's team fell back quite soon, Yaroslav Popovych prepared a brutal attack for his leader. The peloton broke and only Rasmussen, Valverde and Mancebo could hold Armstrong's wheel. Even though they did not collaborate with the American, a gap formed between this group, then Basso and then Ullrich and Kl√∂den. Vinokourov had failed badly, like Christophe Moreau, who had hoped to get the yellow jersey on this stage. Armstrong's attempt to win the stage on a sprint breakaway was foiled by Valverde in the closing meters. Nonetheless, the Texan regained the maillot jaune and seemed to acknowledge Valverde's win perhaps indicating that he saw him as future heir apparent. { Stage 10 result {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rider ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Time -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1  Illes Balears  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2    style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  3    style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  + 9\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  4  Illes Balears  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  5    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 02\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  6    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 15\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  7    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 2' 14\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  8    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  9    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. }  General classification after stage 10 {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rider ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Time -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  ~~1~~  ~~~~Yellow jersey  ~~~~ style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  ~~~~-  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  2    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 38\\" -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  3    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 2' 40\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  4    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 2' 42\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  5  Illes Balears  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 3' 16\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  6    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 3' 58\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  7  Illes Balears  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  + 4' 00\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  8    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 4' 02\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  9    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 4' 16\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. } } ==Stage 11== 13 July 2005 ‚Äî Courchevel to Brian√ßon, Stage 11 was another major mountain stage in the Alps including the legendary Col de la Madeleine and Col du Galibier climbs, the latter being the highest point of this year's tour at 2645m. Alexander Vinokourov, after a disastrous day in the previous stage to Courchevel when he lost over 5 minutes, attacked on the Col de la Madeleine. Lance Armstrong and his rode strongly behind mindful of the threat from Vinokourov but aware of the advantage that they had over him. The tactics of the T-Mobile team riders, including Vinokourov, in support of their apparent team leader Jan Ullrich were, as ever, questionable. Three riders, √ìscar Pereiro (this year's most aggressive rider) and Santiago Botero (both of ) established a breakaway before Pereiro was dropped after the Col du Telegraphe and before the fearsome ascent of the Col du Galibier. Vinokourov crossed the summit of the Galibier first, taking the Henri Desgrange prize, in front of Botero, a rider who was enjoying a renaissance in 2005. Meanwhile, Lance Armstrong's Discovery Channel Team were controlling the peloton at just over 2 minutes behind although Michael Rasmussen jumped ahead to get more King of the Mountain points and to continue his domination of the polka dot jersey. Botero joined Vino on the now wet and dangerous descent and the pair continued together to Briancon where the Kazakhstan champion outsprinted Botero to take his second stage victory after his first one to Gap in the 2003 Tour de France that had seen the major injury to Joseba Beloki and the remarkable cross-country exploits of Lance Armstrong. The peloton, and all the main contenders, came in at 1'15\\" behind thus preserving Armstrong in the yellow jersey and Vinokourov's exploits not making up for the previous day's losses. { Stage 11 result {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rider ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Time -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  3  Credit Agricole  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 15\\" -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  4    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  5    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  6    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  7    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  8    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  9    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  10    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. }  General classification after stage 11 {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rider ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Time -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  ~~1~~  ~~~~Yellow jersey  ~~~~ style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  ~~~~-  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2    style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  + 38\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  3    style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  + 2' 34\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  4    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 2' 40\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  5  Illes Balears  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 3' 16\\" -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  6    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 3' 48\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  7    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 3' 58\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  8  Illes Balears  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 4' 00\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  9    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 4' 02\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 4' 16\\" } } ==References== Tour De France, Stage 1 To Stage 11, 2005 Category:Tour de France stages ","title":"2005 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 11"},{"id":"2231626","text":"Cooper Black is an ultra-bold serif typeface intended for display use that was designed by Oswald Bruce Cooper and released by the Barnhart Brothers & Spindler type foundry in 1922.

Cooper Black followed on from Cooper's career as a lettering artist in Chicago and the Midwest of America in the 1920s. Cooper Black was advertised as being \\"for far-sighted printers with near-sighted customers\\", as well as \\"the Black Menace\\" by detractors. While very bold, Cooper Black is based on traditional \\"old-style\\" serif lettering, rather than the hard-edged \\"fat face\\" fonts popular in the nineteenth century, giving it a soft, 'muddy' appearance, with relatively low contrast between thick and thin strokes. ==Cooper Hilite== Cooper Hilite is a version of Cooper Black originally designed by painting white relief impressions into a printed proof of Cooper Black. It has been digitised by ParaType and Wordshape. ==Imitations and variants== Cooper Black was immediately popular and spawned imitations, including Goudy Heavy Face from Frederic Goudy, Ludlow Black and Pabst Extra Bold.http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/goudy-heavyface/ Cooper Black remains popular: the editors of the typography discussion website Fonts in Use report more submissions of its use than any other face that is not a sans- serif, although outnumbered by Times New Roman once its many variants are added up. Many unusual versions of Cooper were created in the phototypesetting period of the 1960s and 1970s, a period of explosion in production of display faces. These included \\"Ziptop Cooper Black\\" from Photo Lettering Inc., a version with the top bolder than the bottom, and other distorted variants.

In American service, the missile was called the MGM-21A. The missile entered service in 1955 with the French Army. It was used briefly by the US Army in the early 1960s. The missile ceased production in January 1962 after approximately 30,000 missiles had been built. ==Development== Development began in France in 1948, when the Arsenal de l'A√©ronautique in Ch√¢tillon sous Bagneux began looking at the possibility of developing the German X-7 missile further. The missile was designed to be cheap: In 1955, the missile cost 340 Francs and the control box 1,750 Francs. The first rounds were test fired in 1952. Development was completed in 1955 and the missile entered service with the French Army under the designation SS.10 (\\"Sol-Sol\\" French for \\"Surface to Surface\\"). The US army procured 500 missiles and three sets of launching equipment to evaluate a prototype version of the missile between early 1952 and October 1953, but concluded that the missile was not currently ready for use, but that the continued development should be monitored. After development of the missile was completed, the US successfully re-evaluated the missile in mid-1958, and the later SS.11 (also by designer Bastien-Thiry) and Entac missiles were procured for Army use. ==History== In late 1955, Israel ordered 36 SS.10 launchers. They were received a year later, too late for the IDF to use them in the 1956 Suez Crisis. Subsequently, a self-propelled variant was developed, with four launchers carried by Dodge truck. In the early 1960s, SS.10 missiles were retired from the IDF service, replaced by SS.11.Granovskiy The US Army was interested in the missile from an early stage, but pursued development of their own missile - the SSM-A-23 Dart missile. However, after the SSM-A-23 was cancelled in 1958, they began to consider procuring the SS.10 and SS.11 missiles. In February 1959, they decided to buy the SS.10 as a stopgap. The missile was delivered in January 1960 and was phased out in 1963 in favour of the MGM-32 Entac. The missile received the designation MGM-21A. ==Description== In flight, the missile is steered by an unusual arrangement of electrically powered vibrating spoilers, the power for these spoilers is transmitted to the missile along the guidance wires from the operator's station. Since the missile spins in flight, a gyroscope is needed to determine which spoilers are currently up/down or left/right. Guiding the missile to the target is very demanding and requires a high level of operator skill and concentration - this is typical with MCLOS guided missiles. ==General characteristics== * Length: 860 mm * Wingspan: 750 mm * Diameter: 165 mm * Launch weight: 15 kg * Speed: 80 m/s * Range: 500 to 1600 m * Guidance: wire- guided MCLOS * Warhead: 5 kg Hollow-charge 400 mm versus RHA ==ModelsPrototypes=== * Nord-5201 - Two winged prototype. * Nord-5202 - Four winged prototype. * Nord-5203 - Final production version. ===Production versions=== * SS.10 / MGM-21A ==Operators== Map with former SS.10 operators in red ===Former operators=== ; ;https://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/page/trade_register.php ; ; ==References== * Nord SS.10/MGM-21 at Designation-Systems.Net * Oleg Granovskiy, First Generation ATGMs in the IDF (–û–ª–µ–≥ –ì—Ä–∞–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π - –ü–¢–£–† –ø–µ—Ä–≤–æ–≥–æ –ø–æ–∫–æ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤ –ê–û–ò) at Waronline.org ==Notes== Category:Anti-tank missiles of the Cold War Category:Anti-tank missiles of France ","title":"SS.10"},{"id":"2231638","text":"Valery Vladimirovich Polekh (July 5, 1918 - September 6, 2006) was a Russian horn player.

The Bank had roughly 44 billion INR in assets at the time of the merger, not accounting for inflation. The Reserve Bank of India approved the merger effective 10 March 2001. It was headquartered at Madurai. The merger was received well and benefitted the Bank of Madura, with their share price sharply rising, and finally closing at Rs 142 - over double what they hovered at only weeks ago. ICICI, however saw a sharp drop in their share price totally four rupees, it closing at Rs 164.

This is an old tradition, well illustrated in works such as Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Voltaire's Candide. This practice arises in part from the desire of those subject to the power of those in authority to use an available means of limiting this power by demonstrating that the authority figure is just as subject to mockery as those lacking power.John P. Muller, Jane G. Tillman, The Embodied Subject: Minding the Body in Psychoanalysis (2007), p. 78. This represents \\"the attempt to use aggression to protect oneself from engulfment, impingement or humiliation by diminishing the perceived power and threat of the other\\", an effort which often takes the form of caricature of those in authority. This theme was commonly used by British comedy troupe, Monty Python. In their sketches, a \\"common comedic device was for authority figures (such as military officers, police, judges, Conservative politicians, BBC news announcers and even God) to take their characters to extremes by suddenly spouting complete nonsense\\".Craig Hight, Jane Roscoe. Faking It: Mock-Documentary and the Subversion of Factuality. Manchester University Press (2002) (p. 80).

The shows also mockingly portray their resident religious leader ‚Äî Priest Maxi in South Park and Reverend Timothy Lovejoy in The Simpsons. The shows also include, with slightly different characteristics, the flawed exercise of authority by parents, teachers, school principals, mayors, and occasionally of soldiers and politicians.

The church body was for a brief period in fellowship with WELS and ELS, but broke fellowship with those two synods on June 14, 1997, because of differences in the doctrine of the Ministry and the Lord's Supper.

He left high school at seventeen to become a printer‚Äôs devil. He studied illustration at Frank Holme‚Äôs School of Illustration, first as a correspondence student, then moving to Chicago to study in person. While doing poorly at drawing, he did so well in a lettering class taught by Frederic Goudy, that he soon became director of the correspondence department for the school. After Holme died in 1903, the school closed due to financial difficulties, and Cooper took it on himself to provide correspondence education to prepaid students.Da Boll, James M., ‚ÄúOswald Bruce Cooper,‚Äù in Dictionary of American Biography, Supplement Two, to December 31, 1940, Charles Scribner‚Äôs Sons, NY 1958, pp. 119‚Äì120. ==Career== In 1904 Cooper and Fred S. Bertsch formed the design firm of Bertsch & Cooper, providing ad campaigns for such accounts as the Packard Motor Car Company and Anheuser-Busch Breweries, with Cooper providing distinctive hand lettering and sometimes the copy writing as well. In 1914 the firm became a full-service type shop. By the time Fred Bertsch retired in 1924, Bertch & Cooper employed more than fifty people and was the largest art production facility in the Midwest. As he showed considerable talent for writing, many advertising agencies sought his services as a copywriter, but he wrote only for himself and his own firm.Da Boll, James M., ‚ÄúOswald Bruce Cooper.‚Äù ==Personal life== Tall, lanky and homespun, Cooper was a shy man, avoiding social situations and even unnecessary business contacts. Those close to him called him \\"Oz,\\" to everyone else, he was \\"Mister Cooper.\\" In 1920, he married his second cousin, Mary Lou Foster. They had no children. For the last year-and-a-half of his life, Cooper was ill with cancer, dying in Chicago of the disease in 1940.Da Boll, James M., ‚ÄúOswald Bruce Cooper.‚Äù A festschrift anthologizing his work was published in 1949. ==Typefaces== Cooper's Cooper Old Style and its ultra- bold variant Cooper Black. Both are quirky variations on the old-style serif model, intended for display and advertising use. * Cooper series (BB&S; later ATF) When Barnhart Brothers & Spindler Type Foundry (BB&S;) approached Cooper with a proposal to design a complete type family based on his lettering, Cooper had doubts over the deal, but Fred Bertsch saw it as opportunity to gain exposure for Cooper's work and to further promote the design studio, so the deal was made.

Called by designer as a font \\"for far-sighted printers with near-sighted customers,\\" it was hated by conservative typographers, but was popular among graphic designers, to the point that the foundry had problems making enough fonts. It became one of the most popular typefaces to be released in America at that time and had a great influence on the style of the 1920s and 30s. ** Cooper Black (1922), this became ATF's second-best-selling type, after Copperplate Gothic. ** Cooper Black Italic (1922) ** Cooper Hilite (1922) ** Cooper Black Condensed (1926)) 20% lighter than the Cooper Black, the designer described it as ‚Äúcondensed but not squeezed.‚Äù * Cooper Fullface series An ultra-bold display Didone.

They continued to produce the roman face, renaming it Cooper Modern. ** Cooper Fullface (1929, BB&S;) ** Cooper Fullface Italic (1929) Never released due to the BB&S; foundry closure; a lively Bodoni-esque italic. A digital version based on Cooper's original drawings was released by Wordshape in 2010. * Boul Mich (1927, BB&S;)) In 1927 Cooper was asked by the foundry to take an advertising headline from a newspaper clipping and fill it out into a design for a complete alphabet, which he did, disclaiming any credit for the original design. The face was named Boul Mich, after Michigan Boulevard, a street in Chicago where many of the cities advertising agencies were located.

It is caused by a difference in air pressures inside and outside the cavities. ==Presentation == Typically, sinus barotrauma is preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection or allergy. The affected person suffers a sudden sharp facial pain or headache during descent, which increases as the aircraft approaches ground level. The pain can ultimately become disabling unless the ambient pressure is reversed. The pressure difference causes the mucosal lining of the sinuses to become swollen and submucosal bleeding follows with further difficulties ventilating the sinus, especially if the orifices are involved. Ultimately fluid or blood will fill the space. In most cases of sinus barotrauma, localized pain to the frontal area is the predominant symptom. This is due to pain originating from the frontal sinus, it being above the brow bones. Less common is pain referred to the temporal, occipital, or retrobulbar region. Epistaxis or serosanguineous secretion from the nose may occur. Neurological symptoms may affect the adjacent fifth cranial nerve and especially the infraorbital nerve. ==Pathology== The pathology of sinus barotrauma is directly related to Boyle's law, which states that the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure on it, when temperature is constant (P1 √ó V1 = P2 √ó V2). Two types of acute barotrauma are observed: squeeze and reverse squeeze. On ascent, the air in the paranasal sinuses will expand according to Boyle's law, contracting during descent. Normally, the sinuses drain into the nasal cavity through small ostia, which permit mucociliary clearance and ventilation that equilibrates pressure. However, when the opening is obstructed due to inflammation, polyps, mucosal thickening, anatomical abnormalities, or other lesions, pressure equilibration is impossible. Squeeze is produced on descent when trapped air in the sinuses contracts and produces negative pressure. The pressure differentials are directed to the center of the sinuses producing mucosal edema, transudation, and mucosal-or submucosal-hematoma, leading to further occlusion of the sinus ostium. The sinus will fill with fluid or blood unless the pressure differential is neutralized. If the outlet is blocked during ascent, the situation is reversed and \\"reverse squeeze\\" appears. Pressure inside the sinus increases, affecting the walls of the sinus and producing pain or epistaxis. ==Location== The majority of episodes of sinus barotrauma occur in the frontal sinuses with pain localized over the frontal area. Possible explanations for this might be the relatively long and delicate nasofrontal duct that connects the narrow frontal recess with the frontal sinuses. Barotrauma located in the maxillary, ethmoidal, or sphenoid sinuses is observed less frequently and appears when the ostia are blocked; the majority of cases are probably caused by an acute upper respiratory tract infection. The magnitude of the pressure difference needed to produce a barotrauma probably shows great individual variation and is related to the size of the sinus ostium and the rate of ambient pressure change. Due to this, even commercial flying may produce severe cases of barotraumas, although most of the cases are observed in high performance aircraft with lower pressurized cabins. ==Diagnosis== Most cases occur in scuba divers and fliers, and is easily diagnosed when presented to physicians immediately after exposure. On the other hand, the problem may remain undiagnosed when the history fails to relate the symptoms to exposure to environmental pressure changes or if the focus is on other etiologies. ===Grades=== Weissman defined three grades of sinus barotraumas according to symptomatology. * Grade I includes cases with mild transient sinus discomfort without changes visible on X-ray. * Grade II is characterized by severe pain for up to 24 h, with some mucosal thickening on X-ray. * Patients with grade III have severe pain lasting for more than 24 h and X-ray shows severe mucosal thickening or opacification of the affected sinus; epistaxis or subsequent sinusitis may be observed. ==Treatment== Mild cases of barotrauma are readily treated by topical decongestants and painkillers. In severe cases or cases resistant to local treatment, functional endoscopic sinus surgery is indicated in order to re-establish drainage and ventilation of the sinuses. This treatment has shown good results in aviators suffering from recurrent sinus barotrauma. Computer-aided surgery has re- established the drainage of affected sinuses, especially with regard to the sphenoid sinuses. When the sphenoids were entered endoscopically, mucosal petechia and hematoma were clearly seen. ==History== Sinus barotrauma or aerosinusitis has been known since the early development of aviation medicine. However, it was during World War II that the subject first received serious attention and the pathogenesis of the disease was understood to be due to exposure to high altitude flights. Rapid altitude changes with accompanying changes in ambient pressure exposed the aircrews to an increasing number of episodes of sinus barotrauma. Referred pain from barosinusitis to the maxilla consists about one-fifth of in-flight barodontalgia (i.e., pain in the oral cavity caused by barometric pressure change) cases. Although the environment of fighter pilots produces the most stressful barometric changes, commercial flying has changed the picture of the disease. == See also == * * == References  External links == Category:Aviation medicine Category:Effects of external causes Category:Diving medicine ","title":"Aerosinusitis"},{"id":"2231701","text":"Karumuttu Thiagarajan Chettiar (16 June 1893 ‚Äì 29 July 1974), often called the 'Textile King ' or 'Textile Baron ', was an Indian independence activist, industrialist and the founder of Thiagarajar College of Engineering, Thiagarajar school of management and Thiagarajar Polytechnic College, Salem.

He joined the Chinese National Team in 1999 and is part of the People's Liberation Army. ==Competitive highlights== He has qualified for two Olympics. At the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Xiao Qin was one of the favorites for the Olympic title on pommel horse, but his dreams were shattered when he fell during the qualification round. He qualified for the horizontal bar event final but placed 6th. It was also a disappointing Olympics for his team favored to win gold but instead finished 5th. At the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, he redeemed himself by winning gold on the pommel horse along with gold for his team. {  - ! Year ! Competition Description ! Location ! Apparatus ! Rank-Final !

There is no settlement centre in the parish, only a few isolated properties. In the 2001 census it had a population of 10, which was the fourth smallest of Rutland's parish populations.Rutland Civil Parish populations, 2001 accessed 24-Oct-2011 At the 2011 census the population remained less than 100 and was included in the civil parish of Ridlington. It shares its name with Leighfield Forest, a much larger area from Braunston-in-Rutland to Stockerston and from Skeffington to Ridlington, a triangle of land roughly in each direction.Leighfield Forest Project. Leicestershire County Council, accessed 24-Oct-2011 The Leighfield Way is a waymarked route joining the Leicestershire and Rutland Rounds at Belton-in-Rutland with the Hereward Way and Viking Way at Oakham. ==Leighfield Forest== The lane to Leighfield Lodge In the early medieval period, Leighfield Forest was an extensive Royal forest straddling the borders of Rutland and Leicestershire. It included large numbers of sizeable wooded areas, which would mostly have been individually enclosed. The Forest also included roads, villages and farmland so was not ideal for Forest administration. It had been created soon after Henry I became king in 1100 and it was initially known as the Forest of Rutland (although a significant portion was in Leicestershire). Sauvey Castle, near Withcote, was probably built by King John in 1211 as a secluded hunting lodge. In 1235 all the Leicestershire sections were released from Forest Law, and in 1299 an eastern section was similarly disafforested. Abuses by the Royal Officers would seem to have been at least as big a problem as poaching by the lower orders. One forester was found to be keeping 300 pigs in the woods. In 1269 the forester Peter de Neville was arraigned by the king's justices for taking for his own use timber, firewood and charcoal to the amount of 7,000 oaks and other trees. At least four deer parks were enclosed within the Forest, at Lyddington, Ridlington, Flitteriss Park and Cold Overton Park. Of these only Cold Overton still has ancient woodland. By the late 16th century, the Hastings family of Ashby de la Zouch were the Forest Wardens. It was by then known as Leighfield Forest, and was administered as three bailiwicks: Braunston, Ridlington and Beaumont. 33 individual woods are named in an inquisition of 1566, totalling 1060 acres. Skeffington Woods, remnant of Leighfield Forest The end of the Forest came about in 1630 when Charles I removed the royal protection, and sold off his lands. It was rapidly given over to agriculture, whether pasture or tillage, and by 1700 nearly all the woodland has been cleared. The surviving ancient woodlands in the area include Prior's Coppice, Bolt Wood, Owston Woods, Skeffington Woods (listed as Leighfield Forest SSSI), Great Merrible Wood, the Launde woods, Wardley Wood and Stoke Dry Wood. The greater part of the former Forest, including Leighfield parish, is now an open landscape, although with species-rich hedgerows.Discover Rutland: Leighfield Forest Removal of many hedgerows during the 20th century has made the Leighfield woodlands increasingly isolated, but the Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust's 'Living Landscape' project has targeted Leighfield as one of its landscape-scale projects, and is working with the Forestry Commission to create new woodlands that can act as links between the ancient sites.LRWT Living Landscapes Several fragments have been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest as Leighfield Forest SSSI. ==References== Category:Villages in Rutland Category:Civil parishes in Rutland ","title":"Leighfield"},{"id":"2231743","text":"Explicit knowledge (also expressive knowledge)L.

He played 11 of his 19 big league seasons for the Seattle Mariners, while also playing for the Kansas City Royals, Philadelphia Phillies, New York Yankees, and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. While primarily a left fielder, Iba√±ez often saw considerable time as a designated hitter (DH), throughout his career. An All-Star in 2009, Iba√±ez won the Player of the Week Award five times. Despite not reaching 500 plate appearances in a single season until the age of 30, Iba√±ez batted .272 with 424 doubles, 305 home runs and 1,207 runs batted in (RBI) over nineteen major league seasons. He had eight seasons with at least 20 home runs, two seasons with at least 30 home runs, six seasons with at least 90 RBI, four seasons with at least 100 RBI, and ten consecutive seasons (2002‚Äì2011) with at least 30 doubles. In 2004, Iba√±ez tied an American League record with six hits in one game. ==Early life and amateur and college== Iba√±ez's parents emigrated from Cuba to New York in 1970. His father, Juan Armando, who was a chemist in Cuba, worked in a warehouse in the United States. Iba√±ez attended Miami Sunset Senior High School, where he played on the baseball team as a catcher. Fredi Gonz√°lez, who worked at the school as a security guard during the minor league baseball offseason, worked with Iba√±ez on catching. After graduation, he attended Miami-Dade Community College, and was a baseball letterman and an All- Conference selection. ==Professional career (1992‚Äì2014)Draft and Minor Leagues (1992‚Äì96)=== Iba√±ez was selected by the Seattle Mariners in the 36th round of the 1992 Major League Baseball draft. Iba√±ez played as a catcher and outfielder at various levels in the Mariners minor league organization. He began his professional career with the rookie-level AZL Mariners in 1992. Iba√±ez batted .308 with 37 hits, 8 doubles, 2 triples, 1 home run, and 16 RBIs in 33 games that season.

That season, Iba√±ez appeared in four games and went hitless. In 1997, Iba√±ez began the season in the minor leagues with the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers. He batted .304 with 133 hits, 30 doubles, 3 triples, 15 home runs, 82 RBIs in 111 games. On August 10, Iba√±ez made his first appearance of the season in the majors against the Chicago White Sox. He got his first major league hit, a triple, on August 16 against White Sox's pitcher Doug Drabek. On September 27, Iba√±ez hit his first major league home run against the Oakland Athletics' pitcher Mike Oquist. After 11 games in the majors, Iba√±ez batted .154 with 4 hits, 1 triple, 1 home run, and 4 RBIs. Iba√±ez started the 1998 season with the Triple-A Rainiers and batted .216 with 41 hits, 8 doubles, 1 triple, 6 home runs, and 25 RBIs in 52 games. Iba√±ez was called up in August to the majors and batted .255 with 25 hits, 7 doubles, 1 triple, 2 home runs, and 12 RBIs in 37 games.

In 2001 with the Royals, Iba√±ez batted .280 with 78 hits, 11 doubles, 5 triples, 13 home runs, and 54 RBIs in 104 games. He also played with the Triple-A Omaha Royals for 8 games and batted .148 with 4 hits. The next season, 2002, Iba√±ez played the entire season in the majors for the first time in his career. On June 9, Iba√±ez hit a walk-off home run against St. Louis Cardinals' pitcher Mike Timlin to give the Royals a three-to-two win. On June 26, Iba√±ez hit a double, triple, and a home run in the same game against the Detroit Tigers. About the opportunity to play everyday, Iba√±ez said this: At the end of 2002, Iba√±ez batted .294 with 146 hits, 37 doubles, 6 triples, 24 home runs, and 103 RBIs in 137 games.

Iba√±ez received the Joe Burke Special Achievement Award as voted upon by the Kansas City, Missouri chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Before the start of the 2003 season, Iba√±ez filed for salary arbitration. The Royals avoided arbitration hearings with Iba√±ez after he accepted their one-year $3 million contract offer. In 157 games with the Royals, Iba√±ez batted .294 with 179 hits, 33 doubles, 5 triples, 18 home runs, and 90 RBIs. Iba√±ez with the Seattle Mariners ===Second stint with Mariners (2004‚Äì08)=== After three seasons with the Royals, Iba√±ez returned to Seattle in and had a career-high .304 batting average. He also collected a 24-game go-ahead RBI string, matched a club record by reaching base 11 consecutive times, set a career-high and a club record and matched the American League record with six hits, and joined Ichiro Suzuki as only Mariners ever with two five-hit games in one season. He also ranked third among qualifying big league left fielders in UZR, an all-inclusive fielding statistic. With Edgar Mart√≠nez retired, Iba√±ez moved to the DH spot before the season. In 2005, Iba√±ez hit .280 with 20 home runs and 89 RBIs. The Mariners acquired the switch hitting designated hitter Carl Everett from the Chicago White Sox during the 2005 offseason, forcing Iba√±ez to move back to where he played before, namely left field. Iba√±ez enjoyed his most productive season with the Mariners in , when he collected career-highs in home runs (33), RBIs (123), doubles (33) and triples (5), and hit .289 with 103 runs. In , the Mariners acquired Jos√© Vidro to assume the role of DH. Iba√±ez moved back out to left field and posted a .291 batting average with 21 home runs, 105 RBI, 80 runs and 35 doubles in 149 games. Iba√±ez hit 12 home runs and 55 RBIs with a .321 batting average in the second half of the 2008 season. He finished the season with a .293 batting average, 23 home runs, 110 RBI, 85 runs and a career-high 43 doubles by playing 162 games that year. ===Philadelphia Phillies (2009‚Äì11)=== On December 16, 2008, Iba√±ez signed a 3-year, $31.5 million deal with the Philadelphia Phillies. On April 9, 2009, Iba√±ez hit his first home run as a member of the Phillies, a deep, two-run shot to right field at Citizens Bank Park. Ten days later, on April 19, he hit a 2-run, walk-off home run to help the Phillies defeat the San Diego Padres. He hit his eighth career grand slam on April 27 as part of an eighth-inning comeback to help defeat the Washington Nationals at Citizens Bank Park. In voting for the 2009 All Star Game, Iba√±ez received the second-most votes for a NL outfielder with 4,053,355, trailing only the Brewers' Ryan Braun (4,138,559). In the World Series, he batted .304 with four doubles, a home run and four RBI. In 134 regular season games, the 37-year-old Iba√±ez hit .272 with 32 doubles, 93 runs and 93 RBI. He posted career-highs in home runs (34), slugging percentage (.552), and OPS (.899). He had a .991 fielding percentage with two errors in 129 games in left field. He also ranked fourth among qualifying big league left fielders in UZR. Ibanez was the left fielder in Roy Halladay's perfect game on May 29, 2010. Iba√±ez with the Phillies in 2011 During the 2010 season, Iba√±ez played in 155 games with a .275 average, 37 doubles, 16 home runs, and 83 RBI. In 2011, on defense he had the lowest range factor of all major league left fielders, at 1.60. He played 144 games with a .245 average, 31 doubles, 20 home runs, and 84 RBI. ===New York Yankees (2012)=== On February 20, 2012, Iba√±ez agreed to a contract worth $1.1 million with the New York Yankees. The deal was made official one day later. Iba√±ez struggled during spring training. When Brett Gardner suffered an injury in April, Iba√±ez saw increased playing time in left field against right-handed pitchers. On September 22, Iba√±ez hit a game-tying home run in the 13th inning of a game against the Oakland Athletics. In the second to last game of the regular season, Iba√±ez hit a pinch hit home run in the ninth inning and a game-winning RBI single in the 12th inning to keep the Yankees one game ahead of the Baltimore Orioles in the division. During the regular season, Iba√±ez appeared in 130 games, hitting .240 with 19 home runs and 62 RBI. In Game 3 of the 2012 American League Division Series against the Orioles, Iba√±ez pinch hit for Alex Rodriguez and hit home runs in consecutive at bats. He hit the first home run off of Jim Johnson to tie the game 2‚Äì2 in the bottom of the 9th inning; the second one came off of Brian Matusz in the bottom of the 12th‚Äîa walk-off home run to give the Yankees a 3‚Äì2 victory and a two-games-to-one series advantage. The pinch- hit performance set several major league records: he became the first player in major league history to hit two home runs in a postseason game he did not start; the first to hit two home runs in the 9th inning or later of a postseason game; the oldest player to hit a postseason walk-off home run; and the oldest player to hit two home runs in a postseason game. Two days later in the deciding game 5 against the Orioles, Iba√±ez ended a scoreless tie with a single in the bottom of the 5th inning. The Yankees would rally around Iba√±ez, and win the game 3-1 and win the series. The next day, Iba√±ez once again hit a game-tying home run in the bottom of the 9th inning, this time in Game 1 of the 2012 American League Championship Series against the Detroit Tigers, becoming the first player ever to hit 3 home runs in the 9th inning or later in a single postseason. Despite the Yankees losing the series to the Tigers, Iba√±ez became a beloved New York sports figure. ===Third stint with Mariners (2013)=== On December 22, 2012, Iba√±ez agreed to a one-year deal worth $2.75 million with Seattle. The deal was made official four days later. Iba√±ez hit .158 in April, but rebounded in May by batting .297 with 7 HR and 17 RBI. On July 2, he hit his 20th HR of the season. Fifth most in the American League at the time, he became the oldest player in major league history to hit 20 HR before the All-Star break. On September 21, Iba√±ez hit his 29th home run, tying Ted Williams for most home runs in a season by anyone 40 or older. After the season, Iba√±ez was honored with the Hutch Award. During the 2013 season, Iba√±ez batted .242 with 29 home runs and 65 RBI in 124 games played. ===Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (2014)=== On December 27, 2013, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and Iba√±ez officially agreed to terms on a one-year contract. On May 15, 2014, in the bottom of the 9th inning, Iba√±ez hit game- tying three run home run off of New York Mets pitcher Jos√© Valverde, in which the Angels lost by a solo home run by Anthony Recker, later in the game, by a final score of 6-7. On June 21, the Angels released Iba√±ez. In 57 games with the Angels, Iba√±ez hit .157 with 3 home runs and 21 RBIs. ===Second stint with the Royals (2014)=== On June 30, the Kansas City Royals signed Iba√±ez. On July 2, he hit his first home run of the season. With the team struggling with a 48-50 win-loss record on July 21, following comments by manager Ned Yost that the team needed to improve its play, Iba√±ez led a players-only meeting, which players including Eric Hosmer and Lorenzo Cain credited with turning around the attitudes of the players. The Royals then won 24 of their next 30, secured a wild card berth, and reached the 2014 World Series, losing to the San Francisco Giants. Iba√±ez was not on the Royals' postseason roster, except for the Wild Card Game, in which he did not appear. Having interviewed for the Tampa Bay's managerial position vacated by Joe Maddon, the club named Iba√±ez as one of three finalists on November 21, 2014. He had not yet officially retired as a player at the time. ==Post-playing career== On February 2, 2016, he was hired by the Los Angeles Dodgers as a special assistant to the President of Baseball Operations, Andrew Friedman. In April 2016, ESPN hired Iba√±ez as an analyst to replace Curt Schilling.

The civil parish, with just three properties,Rutland County Council report, 9 March 2015; Community Governance Review of Parish of Horn was abolished on 1 April 2016 and merged with Exton to form Exton and Horn. ==History== The village of Horn was mentioned in the Domesday survey, as 'Two hides in Horn of which Langfer had been tenant under Edward the Confessor were held of the king by the Bishop of Durham'. In 1287, Richard son of Richard de Seyton had a manor house at Horne and in 1378 Sir John Seyton had his capital messuage here, although the manor was reportedly valueless in 1376. The land was turned from arable to pasture, which has been suggested as the cause of depopulation. There had been a church, dedicated to All Saints, but it too fell into disrepair and new rectors were installed under a thorn tree in 1471, and until the last appointment in 1809. Horn is part of the Alstoe hundred of Rutland. Proximity to the parish meant that the Battle of Losecoat Field during the War of the Roses was once called the Battle of Hornfield. ==References * The Victoria County History has a lot of detail about Horn.

It resembles a hornless goat, but has very large ears which it can clap like a pair of hands and a long, flexible tail that can be used as a whip. The Sigbin is said to emit a nauseating odor. It is believed to issue forth from its lair during Holy Week, looking for children that it will kill for their hearts, which it fashions into amulets.

The Aswang are said to keep them as pets, along with another mythical creature, a bird known as the Wak Wak. There is speculation that the legend may be based on sightings of an actual animal species that is rarely seen; based on the description of the Sigbin in popular literature, the animal species might be related to the kangaroo.

It can be dated to a sudden conception Romains had in October 1903 of a 'communal spirit' or joint 'psychic life' in groups of people. It is based on ideas of collective consciousness and collective emotion, and on crowd behavior, where members of a group do or think something simultaneously. Unanimism is about an artistic merger with these group phenomena, which transcend the consciousness of the individual. Harry Bergholz writes that \\"grossly generalizing, one might describe its aim as the art of the psychology of human groups\\". Because of this collective emphasis, common themes of unanimist writing include politics and friendship. The primary unanimist work is Romains's multi-volume cycle of novels Les Hommes de bonne volont√© (Men of Good Will), the ideas in which can be traced back to La vie unanime. The narrative jumps from character to character, rather than following one at a time, in an effort to reveal the nature and experience of the group as a whole.

The expression dates to at least 1860. \\"Wicked laugh\\" can be found even earlier, dating back to at least 1784. Another variant, the \\"sardonic laugh,\\" shows up in 1714 and might date back even further. In comic books, where supervillains utter such laughs, they are variously rendered as mwahahaha, muwhahaha, muahahaha, bwahahaha, etc. These words are also commonly used on internet blogs, bulletin board systems, and games. There, they are generally used when some form of victory is attained, or to indicate superiority over someone else (ownage), or also mockingly at a statement one finds hard to believe was uttered in earnestness. During the 1930s, the popular radio program The Shadow used a signature evil laugh as part of its presentation. This was voiced by actor Frank Readick, and his laugh was used even after Orson Welles took over the lead role. The evil laugh voiced by Vincent Price has been used or copied many times in radio, film, music, and television, notably at the end of the music video Michael Jackson's Thriller. \\"evilly laughing\\" emoji In films, evil laughter often fills the soundtrack when the villain is off-camera. In such cases, the laughter follows the hero or victim as they try to escape. An example is in Raiders of the Lost Ark, where Belloq's laugh fills the South American jungle as Indiana Jones escapes from the Hovitos. ==References External links == * Evil Laugh on TV Tropes Category:Sound effects Category:Humour Category:Interjections Category:Laughter Category:Good and evil fi:Nauraminen#Paha nauru ","title":"Evil laughter"},{"id":"2231847","text":"Jules Romains, born Louis Henri Jean Farigoule (26 August 1885 ‚Äì 14 August 1972), was a French poet and writer and the founder of the Unanimism literary movement. His works include the play Knock ou le Triomphe de la m√©decine, and a cycle of works called Les Hommes de bonne volont√© (Men of Good Will). Sinclair Lewis called him one of the six best novelists in the world. He was nominated for the Nobel prize in literature sixteen times. ==Life== Jules Romains was born in Saint-Julien-Chapteuil in the Haute-Loire but went to Paris to attend first the Lyc√©e Condorcet and then the prestigious √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure. He was close to the Abbaye de Cr√©teil, a utopian group founded in 1906 by Charles Vildrac and Ren√© Arcos, which brought together, among others, the writer Georges Duhamel, the painter Albert Gleizes and the musician Albert Doyen. He received his agr√©gation in philosophy in 1909. In the interwar years, he pleaded the cause of pacifism and a united Europe against incipient fascism and despotism. In 1927, he signed a petition (that appeared in the magazine Europe on 15 April) against the law on the general organization of the nation in time of war, abrogating all intellectual independence and all freedom of expression. His name on the petition appeared with those of Lucien Descaves, Louis Guilloux, Henry Poulaille, S√©verine... and those of the young Raymond Aron and Jean-Paul Sartre from the √âcole normale sup√©rieure. His novel The Boys in the Back Room (Les Copains, literally \\"the pals\\") appeared in English in 1937. During World War II he went into exile first to the United States where he spoke on the radio through the Voice of America and then, beginning in 1941, to Mexico where he participated with other French refugees in founding the Institut Fran√ßais d'Am√©rique Latine (IFAL). A writer on many varied topics, Jules Romain was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise on 4 April 1946, occupying chair 12 (of 40). He served as President of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers from 1936 to 1941. In 1964, Jules Romains was named citizen of honor of Saint-Avertin. Following his death in Paris in 1972, his place in the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise was taken by Jean d'Ormesson. Jules Romains is remembered today, among other things, for his concept of Unanimism and his cycle of novels in Les Hommes de bonne volont√© (The Men of Good Will), a remarkable literary fresco depicting the odyssey over a quarter century of two friends, the writer Jallez and politician Jerphanion, who provide an example in literature of Unanimism. ==Unanimism== Romains originally considered unanimism to mean an opposition to individualism or to the exaltation of individual particularities; universal sympathy with life, existence and humanity. In later years, Romains defined it as connected with the end of literature within \\"representation of the world without judgment\\", where his social ideals comprise the highest conception of solidarity as a defense of individual rights. His first book was La vie unanime, published in 1904, and in the preface to Men of Goodwill he identified the ideas in it as essentially the same as those of that later work. The Red Envelope catalog company, in their 2007 Holiday catalog, surprisingly featured Les Createurs on the cover in a photograph, showing a female model playfully frustrated with her husband, a male model posing as a detached intellectual, half-heartedly helping her to decorate the Christmas tree, while his attention is focused on reading Les Createurs. ==Works== * Men of Goodwill (Les Hommes de bonne volont√©, 1932-1946; 27 volumes Paris: Calmann L√©vy) * The body's rapture (Psyche), London: John Lane, 1933 * Tussles with time (Violation de Fronti√®res, 1951), London: Sidgwick & Jackson, 1952 * The Death of a Nobody (Mort de quelqu'un, 1911) ==Filmography== * ', directed by Ren√© Hervil (1925, based on the play Knock) * ', directed by Roger Goupilli√®res and Louis Jouvet (1933, based on the play Knock) * Donogoo Tonka, directed by Reinhold Sch√ºnzel (1936, based on the play Donogoo) ** Donogoo, directed by Reinhold Sch√ºnzel and Henri Chomette (1936, based on the play Donogoo) * Dr. Knock, directed by Guy Lefranc (1951, based on the play Knock) * ', directed by Yves Robert (1965, based on the novel ') * Knock, directed by Lorraine L√©vy (2017, based on the play Knock) ===Screenwriter=== * The Portrait (1923), directed by Jacques Feyder (1923) * ', directed by Maurice Tourneur (1941) ==ReferencesBibliography== * Mauthner, Martin, Otto Abetz and His Paris Acolytes - French Writers Who Flirted with Fascism, 1930‚Äì1945.

This white powder is soluble in alcohols and common organic solvents but is insoluble in water. It is often used as a foamer in plastics and rubber and as a radical initiator. ==Mechanism== In its most characteristic reaction, AIBN decomposes, eliminating a molecule of nitrogen gas to form two 2-cyanoprop-2-yl radicals: :480px These radicals can initiate free-radical polymerizations and other radical-induced reactions. For instance, a mixture of styrene and maleic anhydride in toluene will react if heated, forming the copolymer upon addition of AIBN. Another example of a radical reaction that can be initiated by AIBN is the anti-Markovnikov hydrohalogenation of alkenes. ==Production and analogues== AIBN is produced from acetone cyanohydrin and hydrazine, then followed by oxidation: :2 (CH3)2C(CN)OH + N2H4 ‚Üí [(CH3)2C(CN)]2N2H2 \\\\+ 2 H2O : [(CH3)2C(CN)]2N2H2 \\\\+ Cl2 ‚Üí [(CH3)2C(CN)]2N2 \\\\+ 2 HCl Related azo compounds behave similarly, such as 1,1‚Ä≤-azobis(cyclohexanecarbonitrile). Water-soluble azo initiators are also available.Water soluble Azo initiators ==Safety== AIBN is safer to use than benzoyl peroxide (another radical initiator) because the risk of explosion is far less. However, it is still considered as an explosive compound, decomposing above 65 ¬∞C. A respirator dust mask, protective gloves and safety glasses are recommended. Pyrolysis of AIBN without a trap for the formed 2-cyanopropyl radicals results in the formation of tetramethylsuccinonitrile, which is highly toxic. ==References * Category:Azo compounds Category:Polymer chemistry Category:Reagents for organic chemistry Category:Radical initiators ","title":"Azobisisobutyronitrile"},{"id":"2231867","text":"ENTAC (ENgin T√©l√©guid√© Anti-Char) or MGM-32A was a French MCLOS wire-guided Anti-tank missile. Developed in the early 1950s, the weapon entered service with the French army in 1957. Production ended in 1974 after approximately 140,000 had been built. ==Development== The missile was developed by the French Government agency - DTAT (Direction Technique des Armements Terrestres) at the same time as the private industry SS.10. Development time for the ENTAC was longer than the SS.10, so it did not enter service until 1957. It proved to be a great improvement over the SS.10, which had entered production five years earlier. Once fully developed and tested, production of the ENTAC was given to the firm of Aerospatiale. The ENTAC was designed to be a man-portable weapon or operated from a small vehicle like the Jeep, replacing the Nord SS.10 in French service. ==Design== French Hotchkiss M201 with four ENTAC missiles ENTAC Model 58 missile at the US Redstone testing facility on 29 March 1961 The missile is launched from a simple metal box, which is connected to an operator station. An individual operator station can control up to 10 launcher boxes. The operator manually steers the missile by means of a small joystick. These course corrections are transmitted to the missile via a thin set of wires that trail behind the missile - see MCLOS. Like many early ATGMs, the missile had a large minimum range (see AT-3 Sagger) due to the time it took to get up to flight speed and come under operator control. ==Operational historyAustralia=== Used from 1964 until 1982.Australian Government site ===France=== The missile first entered service in 1957. The ENTAC may have been used by France in small numbers during the 1960s and 1970s on peacekeeping operations. ===India=== ENTAC missiles entered service in 1968 after being ordered a year prior.

The system was often mounted on unarmoured Land Rovers. South African servicemen destroyed at least one FAPLA mortar position with their missiles in September 1975. Two Angolan T-54/55 tanks were also eliminated by ENTAC crews, working in concert with Eland and Ratel-90 armoured cars, during Operation Askari, 1984. ===United States=== The US army purchased the Model 58 ENTAC with an improved warhead to replace the Nord SS.10 (or MGM-21A). It was designed to be an interim weapon, used as the BGM-71 TOW was being developed. The first missiles were deployed in 1963, that year the missile received the US designation MGM-32A. In US service the missile was based on the M151 Jeep and issued to the Anti-tank Platoon of the Heavy Weapons Company. In Korea (7th ID @ 1st CAV) it replaced the Scorpion tracked AT vehicle, a 90MM SP Gun which could not climb the hilly terrain as easily as the Jeep. Using extended cables missiles could be fired from defilade. The missile was phased out between 1968 and 1969, being replaced with the more advanced BGM-71 TOW. It was used in the Vietnam War against fortified infantry positions, but not enemy tanks.

He was the last former British Indian Army officer to command the Indian Army. During his army career, he had commanded the Operation Blue Star under orders from Indira Gandhi to clear the Golden Temple shrine. This was criticized widely as a military failure, with accusations of human rights violations. He introduced a number of technology initiatives to the Indian Army. He was also questioned for his role in recommending the Bofors howitzer in the Bofors Scandal. As the Chief of Army Staff, he planned and executed Operation Brasstacks, a major military exercise, along the Rajasthan border. ==Early life and education== Sundarji was born in Tamil Iyengar Brahmin family Chengelpet, Madras Presidency, British India on 28 April 1928. His official name was Krishnaswamy Sundararajan, but he was popularly known by the informal name of Sundarji. He studied at the Madras Christian College only to leave it before receiving a degree. Later in his career, he graduated from the Defence Services Staff College (DSSC) at Wellington, Tamil Nadu. He also studied at the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth in the US, and the National Defence College in New Delhi. He held a Master of Arts in international studies from Allahabad University and an MSc in defence studies from Madras University. ==Military career== Sundarji joined the British Indian Army in 1945 during the Second World War, though the war ended before he could see any active service. On 28 April 1946, he was given an emergency commission as a second lieutenant in the Mahar Regiment. His early career as an army officer involved operating in the troublesome areas of the North-West Frontier Province and then in Jammu and Kashmir. In the period following India's independence, he saw action in Kargil district, Jammu and Kashmir, during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947-1948. In 1963, he served in the UN mission in the Congo, where he was chief of staff of the Katanga command and was mentioned in dispatches for his gallantry. Sundarji served as the commanding officer of an infantry battalion during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. He played an important role as Brigadier General Staff (BGS) of a corps in the Rangpur sector of Bangladesh, during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. This war led to the liberation of Bangladesh. As an acting brigadier, he was appointed Deputy Military Secretary, Army HQ, on 20 January 1973. Sundarji was promoted to major general on 26 July 1974. For the first time in the history of Indian Army, an infantry officer became the general officer commanding (GOC) of the elite 1st Armoured Division. He was chosen by Gen. KV Krishna Rao to be part of a small team for reorganising the Indian Army, especially with regard to technology. He raised the Mechanised Infantry Regiment by amalgamating various battalions from the army's premier infantry regiments. ===Operation Blue Star=== He was promoted to lieutenant general on 5 February 1979. In 1984, he led Operation Blue Star, intended to evict Sikh extremists who had occupied the Golden Temple in Amritsar. The Indian Army marched into the temple with their boots off. He later said \\"We went inside with humility in our hearts and prayers on our lips\\". According to his wife, Sundarji emerged a changed man after this operation.Tribune.com. Accessed 10 March 2007. ===Chief of Army Staff=== In 1986, he was promoted to General and appointed Chief of Army Staff (COAS) after the assassination of General A.S. Vaidya. After taking over as COAS, he wrote a letter to his soldiers warning of deteriorating standards, and the evil of sycophancy. His operation at Sumdorong Chu in 1986, known as Operation Falcon, was widely praised. The Chinese had occupied Sumdorong Chu and Sundarji used the Indian Air Force's new airlift capability to land a brigade in Zimithang, north of Tawang. Indian forces took up positions on the Hathung La ridge, across the Namka Chu river, where India had faced a humiliating defeat in 1962. The Chinese responded with a counter-build-up and adopted a belligerent tone. Western diplomats predicted war and some of prime minister Rajiv Gandhi's advisers blamed Sundarji's recklessness. But Sundarji stood by his steps, at one point telling a senior aide, \\"Please make alternate arrangements if you think you are not getting adequate professional advice.\\" The confrontation petered out. He was also involved in Operation Brasstacks, a large-scale mechanised artillery and war gaming effort in July 1986 near the Pakistan border, which led to similar Pakistani buildup. The situation was defused through diplomatic talks in February 1987. ===Operation Pawan=== In 1987, the Indian government agreed to a Sri Lankan request and the Indian Peace Keeping Force was sent to Jaffna to disarm the LTTE. However, the Indian Army had no experience in unconventional jungle warfare and took heavy casualties. Among the few successes was the bombing of the LTTE controlled jetties by the Indian Navy Marine Commandos (MARCOS) then known as the Indian Navy Special Commando Force. The IPKF force was withdrawn in 1990. ==Nuclear Policy== Sundarji was amongst the core team that created Indian nuclear policy. As a senior army general, he wrote the Indian Nuclear Doctrine along with Admiral R.H. Tahiliani. Post retirement, he was unhappy with the lack of response among politicians regarding nuclear security, and wrote the book Blind Men of Hindustan in 1993, which discussed nuclear strategy for India and compared India's nuclear policy to six blind men who misinterpret an elephant by touching parts of it. ==Legacy== Sundarji was amongst the most far-sighted armoured corps commanders in the Indian Army. Despite being commissioned in the infantry, he was a keen student and admirer of tank warfare. He pioneered various operational guidelines and challenged his commanders to push the machines and men to the limits. In various exercises he is known to have ordered tanks full speed up sand dunes in the Thar desert in 70 degree heat. Amongst other things he designed the all black uniform of the Armoured Corps. He then went on to create the Mechanised Infantry Regiment. With emphasis on speed, technology and mobile weaponry it is now an integral part of the Indian strike corps. Sundarji can also be credited for shaping modern Indian Army thinking. In his stint as the Commandant of the College of Combat (now Army War College, Mhow), he practically rewrote the war manual with emphasis on speed, decisive action, technology and his abiding love ‚Äì armour. Sundarji was also one of the few to predict the total rout of the Iraqi forces in the Gulf War. Writing for India Today, he was amongst the few who clearly saw what superior air power and technology could do. He also left behind a partially completed autobiography titled ‚ÄòOf Some Consequence: A Soldier Remembers', of which he had completed 33 episodes out of a planned 105. ==Personal life== Sundarji married Padma Sundarji when he was a major. They had two children, Pria and Vikram. In 1978, when he was serving as general officer commanding (GOC) XXXIII Corps in the Eastern Command, she died of cancer at the Army Hospital, Delhi Cantonment. Later, he married for the second time. His second wife, Vani, wrote the introductory chapter of Sundarji's memoirs Of some consequence ‚Äì A soldier remembers, which was published after his death. ==Death== In January 1998, Sundarji was diagnosed with motor neuron disease, from which he died on 8 February 1999 at the age of 70. ==Honours and awards== {  100px 100px  - 100px 100px 100px 100px - 100px 100px 100px 100px - 100px 100px 100px 100px - } {  -  Param Vishisht Seva Medal General Service Medal 1947  - Samanya Seva Medal Samar Seva Medal Paschimi Star Raksha Medal - Sangram Medal Sainya Seva Medal Indian Independence Medal 25th Anniversary of Independence Medal - 30 Years Long Service Medal 20 Years Long Service Medal 9 Years Long Service Medal War Medal: 1939 - 1945 - } ==Dates of rank== { style=\\"background:white\\" !

This is the original Nankai High School, and it is often referred to as Nankai High School in Tianjin to differentiate it from Chongqing Nankai Middle School, its sister school in Chongqing. Nankai is notable as one of the first modern secondary schools in China, and boasts several of the most notable men in modern Chinese history as its alumni. The main campus is located on 22 Nankai 4th Rd, Nankai Qu, Tianjin Shi, China. The other two campuses are in Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city and Haihe Jiaoyu Yuanqu, Tianjin. ==History== Nankai High School was founded in 1904 by Yan Xiu (also known as Yan Fansun). Nankai was originally a private school, featuring a western-style college- preparatory curricula instead of a traditional Confucian curriculum. It was the first school in the Nankai Family of Schools. This system would latter be expanded to include Nankai University in 1919. Nankai University would become one of China's most prestigious universities.\\"Introduction\\" Nankai Middle School ===Establishment=== Nankai's founder, Yan Xiu Before his work at Nankai, Yan Xiu was an intellectual with a strong understanding of traditional Chinese culture who had held positions at the prestigious Hanlin Academy earlier in his career, and in both China's provincial and central governments. The difficulties that confronted China in the late nineteenth century led Yan to become interested in Western and Japanese models of education, to which he attributed the contemporary strength of the West and Japan. Yan's experiences working within the Chinese bureaucracy led him to believe that only the most progressive reforms could save China from further decline.Barnoun and Yu 15 Yan Xiu belonged to a group of reform-minded intellectuals who, in 1905, presented a memorial that suggested abolishing the traditional examination system, focused on knowledge of the Confucian classics, to a system of education focused on practical knowledge. Yan's memorial was well received by the Qing government, which was by then interested in reform as a way to preventing the dynasty from destruction. After he had received a mandate for reform, Yan took part in a large-scale educational reform aimed at modernizing the educational institutions throughout China. After the Qing dynasty was abolished in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, Yan was offered several high-level government positions, but refused them all in preference to devoting his time and energy to the establishment of Nankai. After 1911 Yan Xiu appointed Zhang Boling as Nankai's principal. Zhang had been a well-known advocate for reform and moral renewal during the Qing. By the time of his appointment, Zhang had already gained a reputation as a progressive modernist, advocating the inclusion of Western sciences and physical exercise into the Chinese curriculum. After his appointment as Nankai's principle, Zhang gained a reputation for pioneering educational methods that would be widely emulated throughout China within his lifetime. ===During the Second Sino-Japanese War=== By 1936, war between China and Japan seemed inevitable. The city of Tianjin was located near the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo and was vulnerable to a Japanese attack in the event of war. In anticipation of this war, the administration of the Nankai Schools established another high school in Chongqing, far to the southwest in the interior of China. This school would become known as Nankai High School in Chongqing. When the War of Resistance against Japan began in September 1937, all the faculty and students at Nankai High School were evacuated to the sister school in Chongqing, where the school would remain for the duration of the war. Nankai University and other Chinese universities were also evacuated to the cities of Changsha and (later) Kunming. After the war ended in 1945, Nankai High School was relocated back to its original campus in Tianjin. However, the Nankai High School in Chongqing remained in operation and still exists to this day. ==EducationAfter 1911=== After his appointment as principle, Zhang Boling implemented a synthesis of Japanese and American methods that were grounded in traditional Chinese concepts of self-cultivation. Zhang devised Nankai's curriculum in the attempt to produce students who could overcome the five illnesses that Zhang believed afflicted China in his time: ignorance; weakness; poverty; disunity; and selfishness. Zhang believed that only an education that combined physical education, group activities, scientific education, and moral cultivation could produce leaders who would later contribute to rebuilding China. Zhang created a school motto composed of the characters gong (public spirit) and neng (ability), expressing his hope that his students would develop into leaders with a spirit of integrity, dedication, and civic responsibility who would also have the practical abilities necessary to confront China's difficulties.Barnoun and Yu 15-16 Nankai was a boarding school with strict schedules, discipline, and moral codes, and promoted a strict daily schedule of student activities, similar to contemporary British schools. Zhang placed great importance on physical activity, and worked hard to break down traditional Chinese attitudes of contempt for physical exercise and manual labour. Zhang considered himself as both a teacher and a role model to his students, attempting to personally instruct them in basic principles of hygiene, eating with students, and participating in their exercises. Zhang's close association with his students was unusual in China (and elsewhere), but contributed to the admiration that most of his students reportedly felt for him throughout their lives.Barnoun and Yu 16 ===Today=== Centennial monument Today, Nankai High School is a public school best known for its success in preparing students for the National College Entrance Examination È´òËÄÉ (GƒÅok«éo). The graduates of the school are typically admitted to the best universities in China and around the world. Its college-preparatory curricula covers a wide range of subjects in the humanities, sciences, and social sciences. The school also encourages its students to take part in various academic extracurricular activities, including the International Science Olympiad. Between 1998 and 2005, four Nankai students became IPhO gold medal winners. Nankai students also received gold medals in IMO, IChO, IBO, and IOI. Admission to Nankai High School is usually selective and is based on an applicant's primary school grades and performance on an entrance exam. In 2005, 4,000 students were admitted to Nankai. The school is supported by 300 faculty and staff. The current school principal is Ma Yuemei. In the early 2000s the school established a twinning relationship with a school in the United Kingdom, Manningtree High School. Following the establishment of this relationship, students from both schools visited each other in a series of exchange visits. The most recent visit was in 2008, where Nankai hosted Manningtree during the Beijing Olympics. ==Notable alumniZhou Enlai=== The most famous graduate of Nankai High School was Zhou Enlai, the first Premier of the People's Republic of China. Zhou's skill in literature and composition won him several awards and scholarships, and caught the attention of Nankai's founder, Yan Xiu. Yan once proposed that Zhou marry his daughter, but Zhou declined. Zhou later explained (to a classmate, Zhang Honghao) that his decision not to marry Yan's daughter was due to fears that Zhou could not financially support a family, and that Yan, as his father-in-law, would dominate Zhou's future. Zhou's accomplishments and personal qualities led him to be selected as the speaker at his graduating class, in June 1917. Zhou's experience at Nankai has been cited as a foundation of Zhou's emotional resilience and intellectual growth. Zhang's teachings of gong and neng had been so deeply ingrained in Zhou that he left the school with a great desire to pursue public service, and to acquire the skills necessary to do so. Zhou's participation in debates and stage performances at Nankai contributed to the eloquence and persuasiveness that Zhou would later display throughout his political career.Barnoun and Yu 18 ===Others=== Several other national leaders were also graduates from the school, including another Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao, several university presidents, and more than sixty academicians. Since established in 2001, seven recipients of the annual Top National Scientist Awards were Nankai High School graduates, including Liu Dongsheng (2003), Ye Duzheng (2005), Wu Liangyong (2011) and Zhang Cunhao (2013).

A war of succession or succession war is a war prompted by a succession crisis in which two or more individuals claim the right of successor to a deceased or deposed monarch. The rivals are typically supported by factions within the royal court. Foreign powers sometimes intervene, allying themselves with a faction. This may widen the war into one between those powers. == Analysis  Terminology === In historiography and literature, a war of succession may also be referred to as a succession dispute, dynastic struggle, internecine conflict, fratricidal war, or any combination of these terms. Not all of these are necessarily describing armed conflict, however, and the dispute may be resolved without escalating into open warfare. Wars of succession are also often referred to as a civil war, when in fact it was a conflict within the royalty, or broader aristocracy, that civilians were dragged into, and may therefore be a misnomer, or at least a misleading characterisation. === Elements === Holland, Ada quickly married Louis before her father was buried, triggering the Loon War. Encarta- encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Ada\\". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum. A war of succession is a type of intrastate war concerning struggle for the throne: a conflict about supreme power in a monarchy. It may become an interstate war if foreign powers intervene. A succession war may arise after (or sometimes even before) a universally recognised ruler over a certain territory passes away (sometimes without leaving behind any (legal) offspring), or is declared insane or otherwise incapable to govern, and is deposed. Next, several pretenders step forward, who are either related to the previous ruler and therefore claim to have a right to their possessions based on the hereditary principle, or have concluded a treaty to that effect. They will seek allies within the nobility and/or abroad to support their claims to the throne. After all options for a diplomatic solution ‚Äìsuch as a sharing of power, or a financial deal‚Äì or a quick elimination ‚Äìe.g. by assassination or arrest‚Äì have been exhausted, a military confrontation will follow. Quite often such succession disputes can lead to long-lasting wars. Some wars of succession are about women's right to inherit. This does not exist in some countries (a \\"sword fief\\", where the Salic law applies, for example), but it does in others (a \\"spindle fief\\"). Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"zwaardleen\\"; \\"spilleleen\\". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum. Often a ruler who has no sons, but does have one or more daughters, will try to change the succession laws so that a daughter can succeed him. Such amendments will then be declared invalid by opponents, invoking the local tradition. In some cases, wars of succession could also be centred around the reign in prince-bishoprics. Although these were formally elective monarchies without hereditary succession, the election of the prince-bishop could be strongly intertwined with the dynastic interests of the noble families involved, each of whom would put forward their own candidates. In case of disagreement over the election result, waging war was a possible way of settling the conflict. In the Holy Roman Empire, such wars were known as diocesan feuds. It can sometimes be difficult to determine whether a war was purely or primarily a war of succession, or that other interests were at play as well that shaped the conflict in an equally or more important manner, such ideologies (religions, secularism, nationalism, liberalism, conservatism), economy, territory and so on. Many wars are not called 'war of succession' because hereditary succession was not the most important element, or despite the fact that it was. Similarly, wars can also be unjustly branded a 'war of succession' whilst the succession was actually not the most important issue hanging in the balance. === Polemology === The origins of succession wars lie in feudal or absolutist systems of government, in which the decisions on war and peace could be made by a single sovereign without the population's consent. The politics of the respective rulers was mainly driven by dynastic interests. German historian Johannes Kunisch (1937‚Äì2015) ascertained: \\"The all-driving power was the dynasties' law of the prestige of power, the expansion of power, and the desire to maintain themselves.\\" , Staatsverfassung und M√§chtepolitik ‚Äì Zur Genese von Staatenkonflikten im Zeitalter des Absolutismus (Berlin 1979), p. 16. Moreover, the legal and political coherence of the various provinces of a 'state territory' often consisted merely in nothing more than having a common ruler. Early government systems were therefore based on dynasties, the extinction of which immediately brought on a state crisis. The composition of the governmental institutions of the various provinces and territories also eased their partitioning in case of a conflict, just like the status of claims on individual parts of the country by foreign monarchs. , La guerre ‚Äì c‚Äôest moi! ‚Äì Zum Problem der Staatenkonflikte im Zeitalter des Absolutismus, in: ders.: F√ºrst, Gesellschaft, Krieg ‚Äì Studien zur bellizistischen Disposition des absoluten F√ºrstenstaates (Cologne/Weimar/Vienna 1992), p. 21‚Äì27. To wage a war, a justification is needed (Jus ad bellum). These arguments may be put forward in a declaration of war, to indicate that one is justly taking up arms. As the Dutch lawyer Hugo Grotius (1583‚Äì1645) noted, these must make clear that one is unable to pursue their rightful claims in any other way. , Krieg und Frieden im Zeitalter Ludwigs XIV. (D√ºsseldorf 1987), p. 20. The claims to legal titles from the dynastic sphere were a strong reason for war, because international relations primarily consisted of inheritance and marriage policies until the end of the Ancien R√©gime. These were often so intertwined that it had to lead to conflict. Treaties that led to hereditary linkages, pawning and transfers, made various relations more complicated, and could be utilised for claims as well. That claims were made at all is due to the permanent struggle for competition and prestige between the respective ruling houses. On top of that came the urge of contemporary princes to achieve \\"glory\\" for themselves. After numerous familial conflicts, the principle of primogeniture originated in Western Europe the 11th century, spreading to the rest of Europe (with the exception of Russia) in the 12th and 13th century; it has never evolved outside Europe., The First European Revolution: 970-1215 (2000), p. 66. Wiley- Blackwell. However, it has not prevented the outbreak of wars of succession. A true deluge of succession wars occurred in Europe between the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648) and the Coalition Wars (1792‚Äì1815). , Von der Miliz zum Stehenden Heer ‚Äì Wehrwesen im Absolutismus, in: Milit√§rgeschichtliches Forschungsamt (publisher) Deutsche Milit√§rgeschichte 1648‚Äì1939, Vol.1 (Munich 1983), p. 186f. According to German historian Heinz Duchhardt (1943) the outbreak of wars of succession in the early modern period was stimulated on the one hand by the uncertainty about the degree to which regulations and agreements on hereditary succession were to be considered a respectable part of emerging international law. On the other hand, there was also a lack of effective means to provide them recognition and validation. , Krieg und Frieden im Zeitalter Ludwigs XIV. (D√ºsseldorf 1987), p. 17. According to British statesman Henry Brougham (Lord Chancellor 1830‚Äì34), there were more and longer wars of succession in Europe between 1066 and the French Revolution (1789‚Äì99) than all other wars put together. \\"A war of succession is the most lasting of wars. The hereditary principle keeps it in perpetual life ‚Äì [whereas] a war of election is always short, and never revives\\", he opined, arguing for elective monarchy to solve the problem. In the Mughal Empire, there was no tradition of primogeniture. Instead it was customary for sons to overthrow their father, and for brothers to war to the death among themselves. In Andean civilizations such as the Inca Empire (1438‚Äì1533), it was customary for a lord to pass on his reign to the son he perceived to be the most able, not necessarily his oldest son; sometimes he chose a brother instead. After the Spanish colonization of the Americas began in 1492, some Andean lords began to assert their eldest-born sons were the only 'legitimate' heirs (as was common to European primogeniture customs), while others maintained Andean succession customs involving the co-regency of a younger son of a sitting ruler during the latter's lifetime, each whenever the circumstances favoured either approach. == List of wars of succession == Note: Wars of succession in transcontinental states are mentioned under the continents where their capital city was located.

The common name is derived from its symmetrical, erect and urn-like capsules that lack peristomes, these features characterising the genus. They are commonly found on exposed soils that are often associated with locations that become very wet in the spring, such as along river banks or on alluvial mud. They occur from near sea level to about 2500 metres. The capsules mature over the winter and into the spring.

W. L. Holt Ernest William Lyons Holt or E. W. L. Holt (17 October 1864 - 10 June 1922) was an eminent English marine naturalist and biologist who specialized in ichthyology, the study of fish. His work helped lay a scientific foundation for the fishery management in Ireland, and together with William Spotswood Green, he strongly influenced the development of the Irish Fisheries in its early years. ==BiographyEarly life=== Holt was born in London and was educated at Eton, where he won a prize in biology. After school, he decided on a career in the British Army, enrolling at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and after completing his officer training was commissioned into the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry. He participated in the Nile Campaign (1884/85) and then in the Third Burmese War of 1886/87. During that latter campaign, he fell sick and was invalided home. Back in civilian life, Holt began studying zoology at the University of St. Andrews in 1888. ===Ichthyological studies=== Two years later, he participated as assistant-naturalist in a fishery survey on the west coast of Ireland, organized by the Royal Dublin Society. This expedition was led by William Spotswood Green, with whom Holt would work together for much of his later career. That survey made Holt's name as an ichthyologist; he published not only several papers on the eggs and the early larval stages of fish but also wrote the general report of the expedition. As a result of Green's and Holt's work, the government instituted a formal program of fishery surveys under the auspice of the newly formed Congested Districts Board in 1892. Green became the board's Chief Inspector of Fisheries, while Holt participated as a scientific advisor, although he would leave Ireland for a few years. Holt joined the Marine Biological Association (MBA) and worked until 1894 at Grimsby, where he was in charge of a newly opened research station for the North Sea. After a brief stint at the Station zoologique d'Endoume at Marseille he then worked for three years at the Plymouth Marine Laboratory. Nevertheless, E. W. L. Holt maintained his ties with Ireland, and in 1895 he purchased a dismasted brigantine named Saturn for the Royal Dublin Society and had it equipped as a marine biology research station. In 1899, he returned to Ireland, taking charge of the Saturn and her four small auxiliary sailing boats used for sampling. The floating laboratory was stationed in the Connemara district in County Galway; it lay at Ballynakill in winter and was towed to Inishbofin for the summer months. In 1900, the Saturn was transferred to the new Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland. Green became Chief Inspector of its Fisheries Branch; Holt was at first scientific advisor and later, as of 1908, Fisheries Inspector. They were joined by other young biologists, among them Rowland Southern and George Philip Farrar. With the department's research and fisheries protection vessel Helga they continued their surveys of the west coast of Ireland. In 1908, the ship was replaced by a new one, the Helga II, which was built to the specifications of Green and Holt. With Holt's backing, the new ship participated in the Clare Island Survey of 1909-1911\\\\. When that was completed, the Helga II returned to her regular fisheries research and protection duties under the direction of Holt. ===Later life=== When Green retired in 1914, Holt succeeded him as Chief Inspector. Scientific work was stopped when World War I broke out, and the administrative duties of his post did not allow Holt to continue research work of his own. After the war, the political changes in Ireland as well as Holt's failing health prevented further serious research. In May 1922, Holt became seriously ill and left Dublin for London, where he died on 10 June that year of Bright's disease (an old term for glomerulonephritis, a kidney disease). In 1949, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Food (MAFF) put into service a research vessel named after him. == References == *Biographical Etymology of Marine Organisms - H. *Collins, T.: Oysters and antiquities: a biographical note on E.W.L.

It is the sole species in the genus Spartium, but is closely related to the other brooms in the genera Cytisus and Genista. There are many binomials in Spartium that are of dubious validity (see below). The Latin specific epithet junceum means \\"rush-like\\", referring to the shoots, which show a passing resemblance to those of the rush genus Juncus. ==Distribution and habitat== This species is native to the Mediterranean in southern Europe, southwest Asia and northwest Africa, where it is found in sunny sites, usually on dry, sandy soils. ==Description== S. junceum is a vigorous, deciduous shrub growing to tall, rarely , with main stems up to thick, rarely . It has thick, somewhat succulent grey-green rush- like shoots with very sparse small deciduous leaves 1 to 3 cm long and up to 4 mm broad. The leaves are of little importance to the plant, with much of the photosynthesis occurring in the green shoots (a water-conserving strategy in its dry climate). The leaves fall away early.Jepson Manual Treatment In late spring and summer shoots are covered in profuse fragrant yellow pea-like flowers 1 to 2 cm across. In late summer, the legumes (seed pods) mature black and reach long. They burst open, often with an audible crack, spreading seed from the parent plant. ==Invasive species== Spartium junceum has been widely introduced into other areas, and is regarded as a noxious invasive species in places with a Mediterranean climate such as California and Oregon, Hawaii, central Chile, southeastern Australia, the Western Cape in South Africa and the Canary Islands and Azores.US Forest Service Fire Ecology It was first introduced to California as an ornamental plant.Element Stewardship: S. junceum ==Uses== The plant is used as an ornamental plant in gardens and in landscape plantings. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. In Bolivia and Peru, the plant is known as retama, (not to be confused with the genus Retama) and has become very well established in some areas. It is one of the most common ornamental plants, often seen growing along sidewalks in La Paz. Retama has made its way into the ethnobotany of the indigenous Aymara and Quechua cultures. The plant is also used as a flavoring, and for its essential oil, known as genet absolute.FAO Its fibers have been used for cloth and it produces a yellow dye.botanical.com ==Gallery== Massif de gen√™ts (Spartieum junceum).jpg Spartium junceum2.jpgFlowers Fabaceae - Spartium junceum-003.JPGClose-up of a flower Spartium junceum6.jpgMature fruit ==Nomina dubia== The status of the following species is unresolved: * Spartium acanthocladon Spreng. * Spartium acutifolium Lindl. * Spartium affine Spach * Spartium albicans Cav. * Spartium album Desf. * Spartium alpinum Host ex Steud. * Spartium ambigum Spach * Spartium americanum Meyen * Spartium amoenum Salisb. * Spartium angulosum Gilib. * Spartium aragonense Pourr. ex Willk. & Lange * Spartium arborescens Mill. * Spartium arboreum Desf. * Spartium argenteum Steud. * Spartium aspalatoides Desf. * Spartium aureum Cav. * Spartium baeticum Samp. * Spartium bourgaei (Boiss.)

It has become a standard for the phase characterization of single & pure components. The other state description parameters are molecular weight, critical temperature, critical pressure, and critical volume (or critical compressibility). The acentric factor is said to be a measure of the non-sphericity (centricity) of molecules. As it increases, the vapor curve is \\"pulled\\" down, resulting in higher boiling points. It is defined as: :\\\\omega = - \\\\log_{10} (p^{\\\\rm{sat}}_r) - 1, {\\\\rm \\\\ at \\\\ } T_r = 0.7. where T_r = \\\\frac{T}{T_c} is the reduced temperature, p^{\\\\rm{sat}}_r = \\\\frac{p^{\\\\rm{sat}}}{p_c} is the reduced saturation vapor pressure. For many monatomic fluids :p_r^{\\\\rm{sat}}{\\\\rm \\\\ at \\\\ } T_r = 0.7, is close to 0.1, therefore \\\\omega \\\\to 0. In many cases, T_r = 0.7 lies above the boiling temperature of liquids at atmosphere pressure. Values of can be determined for any fluid from accurate experimental vapor pressure data. Preferably, these data should first be regressed against a vapor pressure equation, like . (In this regression, a careful check for erroneous vapor pressure measurements must be made, preferably using a log(P) vs. 1/T graph, and any obviously incorrect or dubious values should be discarded. The regression should then be re-run with the remaining good values until a good fit is obtained.) Using the known critical temperature, Tc, vapor pressure at Tr=0.7 can then be used in the defining equation, above, to estimate acentric factor. The definition of gives essentially zero for the noble gases argon, krypton, and xenon. \\\\omega is very close to zero for other spherical molecules. Values of correspond to vapor pressures above the critical pressure, and are non-physical. By definition, a van der Waals fluid has a critical compressibility of 3/8 and an acentric factor of about ‚àí0.302024, indicating a small ultra-spherical molecule. A Redlich-Kwong fluid has a critical compressibility of 1/3 and an acentric factor of about 0.058280, close to nitrogen; without the temperature dependence of its attractive term, its acentric factor would be only -0.293572. ==Values of some common gases== {   align=\\"center\\" f0f0f0;\\"Molecule  align=\\"center\\" f0f0f0;\\"Acentric Factor -  Acetone0.304 -  Acetylene0.187 -  Ammonia0.253 -  Argon0.000 -  Carbon Dioxide0.228 -  Decane0.484 -  Ethanol0.644 -  Helium-0.390 -  Hydrogen-0.220 -  Krypton0.000 -  Methanol0.556 -  Neon0.000 -  Nitrogen0.040 -  Nitrous Oxide0.142 -  Oxygen0.022 -  Xenon0.000 } ==See also== * Equation of state * Reduced pressure * Reduced temperature == References == Category:Gas laws ","title":"Acentric factor"},{"id":"2231933","text":"Good Girls Don't is an American sitcom created by Claudia Lonow and produced by Carsey-Werner-Mandabach which stars Bree Turner and Joy Gohring.

She is widely regarded as one of the greatest gymnasts ever on the balance beam, for which she created a move known as the \\"Yang Bo\\", which is rated as a D element in the Code of Points. Although widely renowned for her work on beam, Yang often had difficulty landing her dismounts which prevented her from medalling at several major competitions. She competed at the 1992 Summer Olympics, placing 25th in the all-around and 7th on the beam. She won the 1990 World Cup Final on Balance Beam and won the bronze medal with her team at the 1989 World Championship. At the 1989 World Championships in Stuttgart, Yang performed an innovative beam routine during the team and individual all-round competitions, where she placed 5th. In the event finals, she under-rotated her dismount and placed 7th with a score of 9.800. In 1990, she competed at the Asian Games in Beijing, finishing 6th in the All-Around, 3rd on beam, and won the team all- around gold. Later that year, she won the beam title at the World Cup Final in Brussels. At the 1991 World Championships, she placed 5th in the balance beam with a score of 9.887 after taking multiple steps on her dismount. Yang was on the Chinese 1992 Summer Olympic team. The Chinese team placed 4th. Individually, she placed 13th in the all-around after a fall on bars. She also qualified in 6th place to the balance beam finals, where she fell during her layout series, though was able to stick the landing of her dismount. She placed 7th in that event with a score of 9.300. Her teammate, Lu Li, won the silver medal along with American gymnast Shannon Miller.

The Reverend Thomas Roscoe Rede Stebbing FRS, FLS (6 February 1835, London ‚Äì 8 July 1926, Royal Tunbridge Wells) was a British zoologist, who described himself as \\"a serf to natural history, principally employed about Crustacea\\". Educated in London and Oxford, he only took to natural history in his thirties, having worked as a teacher until then. Although an ordained Anglican priest, Stebbing promoted Darwinism in a number of popular works, and was banned from preaching as a result. His scientific works mostly concerned crustaceans, especially the Amphipoda and Isopoda, the most notable being his work on the amphipods of the Challenger expedition. ==Biography== Caricature of Samuel Wilberforce, known as \\"Soapy Sam\\", from an 1869 issue of Vanity Fair: Wilberforce ordained Stebbing in 1859, but became a staunch opponent of Darwinism, while Stebbing became a fervent supporter. Thomas Roscoe Rede Stebbing was born on 6 February 1835 in Euston Square, London, the seventh of thirteen or fourteen children, to the clergyman and editor of the Athenaeum, Henry Stebbing, and his wife, Mary Griffin. Thomas was educated at the King's College School, and afterwards entered King's College, London to study classics, graduating with a BA in 1855. He then matriculated at Lincoln College, Oxford, before studied at Worcester College, Oxford, gaining a BA in law and modern history there in 1857 and an MA in 1859. Around this time, he was a master at Radley College and Wellington College. He took on various roles at Worcester College, including that of fellow (1860‚Äì1868), tutor (1865‚Äì1867), vice-provost (1865) and eventually dean (1866), as well as a lecturer in divinity. He resigned his fellowship in 1868. He was ordained into the Church of England by Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford in 1859. By 1863, Stebbing had begun to work as a tutor in Reigate, Surrey, where he met the entomologist William Wilson Saunders, whose daughter Mary Anne was a capable botanist and illustrator. Stebbing took up the study of natural history around this time, and married Mary Anne in 1867. The couple moved to Torquay, Devon after their marriage, where Stebbing continued to work as a tutor and schoolmaster, and began to write about theology, Darwinism and natural history, partly under the influence of the naturalist William Pengelly. In 1873, Stebbing produced his first paper on crustaceans, and began to study the Amphipoda the following year. In 1877, Stebbing moved to Royal Tunbridge Wells, where he lived in Ephraim Lodge, on the edge of Tunbridge Wells Common, to benefit from the greater number of students in London, and to be closer to the libraries, museums and scientific circles in the capital. As his finances improved, he was able to give up teaching altogether and concentrate on writing. He died in Ephraim Lodge on 8 July 1926. His funeral was held at St. Paul's Church, Rusthall, where Stebbing had officiated when requested; since its churchyard was inadequate, Stebbing's body was buried in the town's public cemetery. His wife survived him by only a few months. ==Evolution and religion== Having trained as an evangelical Anglican, Stebbing expected to be a staunch opponent of Charles Darwin's recently published theory of evolution by natural selection. Stebbing reported that \\"on reading The Origin of Species, as a preliminary, it has to be confessed that, instead of confuting, I became his ardent disciple\\", and so he adopted the position of a religious rationalist. Following a critical review of The Descent of Man in The Times in 1871, Stebbing gained prominence by responding in Nature. Stebbing wrote a number of essays on the topic of Darwinism, in which he dissected the argument posited against it, and questioned various aspects of Christianity, including the literal truth of the Book of Genesis, the doctrine of the Trinity, the divinity of Jesus, many of the Thirty-Nine Articles, miracles and prophecy. They included Essays on Darwinism (1871), Faith in Fetters (1919) and Plain Speaking (1926). His outspoken stance resulted in his being banned from preaching, and he was never offered a parish by the church. ==Crustacea== Pariambus typicus a species in the genus Pariambus, which Stebbing erected in 1888 Most of Stebbing's scientific works, comprising more than 110 papers, covered amphipod crustaceans. Rev. A. M. Norman, a member of the Challenger Committee, recommended that Stebbing produce a monograph on the amphipods collected on the 1872‚Äì1876 expedition by HMS Challenger, which he did, reproducing the original description for every genus, and providing an extensive bibliography of the group. He also produced a monograph of the Cumacea, a natural history of the Crustacea, and a biography of the Scottish naturalist and founder of the University Marine Biological Station, Millport, David Robertson. In 1906, Stebbing published the volume on Gammaridea for the series '. family Eusiridae in 1888 for amphipods such as Eusirus holmii. ==Legacy== Stebbing was made a Fellow of the Linnean Society on 5 December 1895, a Fellow of the Royal Society on 4 June 1896, and was awarded the Gold Medal of the Linnean Society in 1908. He had strenuously advocated the admittance of women to the Linnean Society, and obtained a supplementary charter to allow it; his wife was among the first women to be admitted. A number of animal species have been named in honour of Stebbing: *Hyale stebbingi Chevreux, 1888 (Amphipoda: Hyalidae) *Parapodascon stebbingi (Giard & Bonnier, 1895) (Isopoda: Podasconidae) *Argissa stebbingi Bonnier, 1896, a synonym of Argissa hamatipes (Norman, 1869) (Amphipoda: Argissidae) *Phronima stebbingii Vosseler, 1901 (Amphipoda: Phronimidae) *Metapenaeus stebbingi (Nobili, 1904) (Decapoda: Penaeidae) *Protellopsis stebbingii Pearse, 1908 (Amphipoda: Caprellidae) *Sphyrapus stebbingi Richardson, 1911 (Tanaidacea: Sphyrapidae) *Macropisthopus stebbingi K.

The painting was created in the 15th century and depicts Saint George fighting the dragon Fresco-secco (or a secco or fresco finto) is a wall painting technique where pigments mixed with an organic binder and/or lime are applied onto a dry plaster.Secco. In: The paints used can e.g. be casein paint, tempera, oil paint, silicate mineral paint. If the pigments are mixed with lime water or lime milk and applied to a dry plaster the technique is called lime secco painting. The secco technique contrasts with the fresco technique, where the painting is executed on a layer of wet plaster. Because the pigments do not become part of the wall, as in buon fresco, fresco-secco paintings are less durable. The colors may flake off the painting as time goes by, but this technique has the advantages of a longer working time and retouchability. In Italy, fresco technique was reintroduced around 1300 and led to an increase in the general quality of mural painting.

Born to the Grant's distillery family who created Glenfiddich whisky, he was one of Scotland's Great Officers of State for the last twelve years of his life. A classical scholar and talented orator who nonetheless lost his first two election campaigns, Grant sat in the House of Commons from 1955 to 1962. Throughout that period he was a Law Officer: first Solicitor General for Scotland, then Lord Advocate. He left Parliament in 1962 to become Lord Justice Clerk, the second most senior judge in Scotland. His work included chairing the eponymous Grant Committee, a major inquiry into the working of Scotland's sheriff courts. While still in office, Grant died in a traffic collision in the Scottish Highlands, with alcohol in his blood. The crash left two other men dead and a young family seriously injured. == Early life and family == Grant was born on 19 June 1909 in Dufftown, Banff, the son of Edward Grant. His mother was a former Miss Kennedy, who Edward had married in 1908. His grandfather William Grant (1839‚Äì1923) was the founder of the distillers William Grant & Sons, producers of Glenfiddich whisky. Edward had been a solicitor for the Caledonian Railway in Glasgow, before returning to Dufftown to work for the family's Balvenie distillery. He died in September 1911, aged only 34, when William only two years old. Janet Roberts, a granddaughter of the distillery founder and therefore presumably Grant's first cousin, was Scotland's oldest person when she died in 2012 at the age of 110. == Education and World War II == Schooled at Fettes College in Edinburgh, Grant won a scholarship in classics to Oriel College, Oxford, where he graduated with a first-class degree. He then studied law at Edinburgh University, winning an LLB with distinction. He was admitted as an advocate on 2 November 1934. As an officer of the Territorial Army, he was mobilised at the outset of World War II, and served in the Royal Artillery, reaching the rank of major. In 1943 or 1944 he became Deputy Assistant Adjutant General at the War Office. == Career == Returning to the bar after demobilisation in 1945, Grant rebuilt his legal practice, focusing on trusts, wills, inheritance and company law. In 1949 he became standing junior counsel to the Ministry of Pensions in Scotland. With a reputation for fast work and effective presentation, he took silk in 1951. He lectured in law at Edinburgh University, and from 1950 to 1954 he chaired the National Health Service Tribunal for Scotland. In the same period, he was also a senior advocate depute (i.e. a prosecutor). === Politics and law officer === In the early 1950s, Grant was twice an unsuccessful parliamentary candidate for the Labour-held constituency of Edinburgh East. At the 1951 general election, aided by the lack of a Liberal Party candidate, he reduced the majority of the sitting Member of Parliament (MP) and current Lord Advocate, John Wheatley, by nearly half. However at the by-election in April 1954 after Wheatley became a judge, Labour increased its majority to over 5,000, reversing a swing to the government in the previous six by-elections that year. Still without a parliamentary seat, Grant was appointed in January 1955 as Solicitor General for Scotland. He succeeded William Rankine Milligan who had been promoted to Lord Advocate to replace James Latham Clyde, who had been raised to the bench as a Senator of the College of Justice in the place of Lord Cooper. He took office as Milligan's deputy in the last months of Winston Churchill's premiership. Grant was later selected as the Unionists' prospective parliamentary candidate for the Unionist-held seat of Glasgow Woodside. At the general election in May 1955, Grant's oratory drew over a thousand people to his eve-of-poll rally on 25 May in Hillhead, with hundreds more turned away. Two girls fainted in the excitement, which the Glasgow Herald newspaper suggested set \\"a minor record for 1955 political meetings\\". He held the seat for the Unionists, with an increased majority, assisted by favourable boundary changes. Grant and Milligan were retained in office both in the 1955‚Äì57 government of Churchill's successor, Anthony Eden, and in the post-1957 government of Harold Macmillan. Grant became a privy counsellor in the Queens's 1958 Birthday Honours. At the general election in October 1959, Grant was re-elected in Glasgow Woodside. When Milligan was appointed as a judge in 1960, Grant was promoted to fill the vacancy as Lord Advocate. === Lord Advocate === His successor as Solicitor General, David Anderson, was not an MP. This left Grant as the government's only spokesperson in the Commons on Scottish legal matters. As Lord Advocate, Grant held ultimate authority to decide whether any prosecution should proceed. One of the cases which he declined to bring was a charge of obscenity against the publishers of Lady Chatterley's Lover, following the unsuccessful prosecution in England. In November 1960, Grant announced in the Commons that the book was \\"tedious\\" and that he would not prosecute. The Labour MP Emrys Hughes congratulated Grant for his \\"extreme common sense\\", and a subsequent High Court challenge to his decision failed. However, Grant was no liberal. In Winnipeg in 1961, he opposed recent British moves to restrict capital punishment, describing them as mistaken and a threat to public safety. In 1962, Grant led the defence in the Scottish courts of a claim for about ¬£60 million (¬£ in ) in damages by the Glasgow-based Burmah Oil Company against the government of the United Kingdom. During the Japanese conquest of Burma in 1941 and 1942, the company's assets in Rangoon had been destroyed under a \\"scorched earth\\" policy by retreating British forces. Having been advised in the late 1940s to sue the government of Burma, the company's company's 12 years of litigation had failed to establish liability against Burma. The trial judge, Lord Kilbrandon, ruled in favour of the oil company. His judgment was overturned by the First Division of the Inner House of the Court of Session, which was in turn overruled by the law lords in Burmah Oil Co Ltd v Lord Advocate. Burmah Oil's legal victory was retrospectively nullified by the War Damage Act 1965. === Lord Justice Clerk === After the death in April 1962 of the Lord Justice Clerk, George Thomson, it was expected that the government would follow the usual practice of appointing the Lord Advocate to the judicial vacancy. The decision was in fact usually made by the Lord Advocate, who traditionally appointed himself, with a substantial rise in salary. (In 1967, then Lord Advocate Gordon Stott was elevated to the judiciary, and later joked \\"I appointed myself, and a jolly good judge I turned out to be\\"). However, after the office had been vacant for more than three months, the Labour MP James Hoy raised the issue at Prime Minister's Questions on 31 July, suggesting that the delay was due to government fears of losing a by-election. (At the 1959 election, Grant had a majority of only 2,084 in his Woodside constituency, down from 4,303 in 1955. Woodside was by then considered a marginal seat.). Prime Minister Harold Macmillan declined a challenge from opposition leader Hugh Gaitskell to explain the reasons for the delay, but promised that a new Justice Clerk would be in place before the Scottish courts resumed on 2 October. On 25 September, a week before the courts opened, Grant was raised to the bench with the judicial title Lord Grant. The Glasgow Woodside by-election was held on 22 November. As expected, it was won by the Labour candidate Neil Carmichael. As a judge, Grant gravitated towards criminal cases. He also undertook a lot of the court's administrative duties.  Grant Committee  In 1963, the Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Noble appointed Grant as chairman of a committee of inquiry into Scotland's sheriff courts. The committee included David Brand QC, several solicitors, and others. The Committee on the Sheriff Court, known as the Grant Committee, reported in July 1967, recommending a major reorganisation of the courts to end the long delays in criminal cases. Its recommendations included an increase in the number of full-time sheriffs, the abolition of juries in civil cases in the sheriff courts, increasing the maximum sentence imposed by sheriffs from two years to three, and broadening the recruitment base for sheriffs to include solicitors and academic lawyers. The report led to the Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1971. === Other interests === Grant was the first chairman of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society as well as a director of Scottish Opera. == Personal life == In 1934, Grant became engaged to Margaret Katharine Milne, a native of Aberdeen. They married in 1936, and lived in Moray Place in the New Town of Edinburgh. The couple had two sons and a daughter, and a reputation for generous hospitality. == Death == Lord Grant died on 19 November 1972 as a result of a road accident near Lynchat, about 3 miles north of Kingussie in Inverness-shire. He was 63 years old. Driving home alone from Brora in Sutherland, his BMW had overtaken a car transporter on a double bend, and collided with a car traveling in the opposite direction, carrying a young family home to Alness. The crash killed the driver of the other car, and seriously injured his wife and their three children, aged between three and seven years. All four survivors were taken to hospital in Inverness. A male passenger in their car was killed along with the driver. The fatal accident inquiry in May 1973 heard that blood tests showed Lord Grant to have consumed the equivalent of two pints of beer or two large whiskies. No alcohol was found in the blood of the other driver. The injured widow testified that her husband had been driving at under .

(Summer, 1994), pp. 345-368. Until the 1920s, historians generally considered Moldovans as a subgroup of the Romanian ethnos.King, pg. 2 After 1924, within the newly created Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, Soviet authorities supported the creation of a different standardized language (see Moldovan language) allegedly in order to prove that Moldovans form a separate ethnic group.King, pg. 3Michael Bruchis. The Language Policy of the CPSU and the Linguistic Situation in Soviet Moldavia, in Soviet Studies, Vol. 36, No. 1. (Jan., 1984), pp. 119. A 1908 map of Romanian dialects (Banat, Moldovan, Muntenian) by Gustav Weigand In the past, the term \\"Moldovan\\" has been used to refer to the population of the historical Principality of Moldavia. However, for the inhabitants of Bessarabia living under the Russian rule, the term gained an ethnic connotation by the beginning of the 20th century: in May 1917, at a congress of Bessarabian teachers, a dispute arose over the identification of the native population; a group protested against being called \\"Romanians\\", affirming they were \\"Moldovan\\",Stuart J. Kaufman, Modern Hatreds: The Symbolic Politics of Ethnic War, Cornell University Press, 2001, , pg. 134 while another group, led by poet Alexei Mateevici, supported the view that the Moldovans are also Romanians. Mateevici's speech at the teachers' congress at Romanian wikisource In 1918, Bessarabia joined the Kingdom of Romania, following a vote of Sfatul »öƒÉrii. The circumstance of the vote was itself complex, since the Romanian troops were present in Bessarabia at the request of the Sfatul »öƒÉrii as it was facing exterior threats and anarchy.Charles King, The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the politics of culture, Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, 2000, page 33 \\"The occupation of Bessarabia by the Romanian[s troops], although carried out after an appeal of members of the Sfatul »öƒÉrii and other Moldovan organizations, was not universally welcomed\\"Petrescu, Cristina. Contrasting/Conflicting Identities: Bessarabians, Romanians, Moldovans in Nation-Building and Contested identities: Romanian & Hungarian Case Studies. Editura Polirom. 2001. As Sorin Alexandrescu suggests, taking into account the situation at that time, the chaos in Russia and the undecided balance in the war, it is reasonable to suppose that the presence of Romanian troops in Bessarabia created a situation in which the majority in the Sfatul T√£rii decided to rally the faction that was advocating the union with Romania as a solution for overcoming of the triple threat of Bolshevism, Ukrainian expansionism and general anarchy. Map depicting the borders of the Kingdom of Romania (1918‚Äì1940) and the M.A.S.S.R. to the east. By the time of the union, the largely illiterate Romanian-speaking peasants of Bessarabia did not consider themselves part of a larger Romanian nation, and there was no mass nationalist movement as in other regions, such as in Transylvania.Livezeanu, Irina. Cultural Politics in Greater Romania: Regionalism, Nation Building, and Ethnic Struggle, 1918-1930. Cornell University Press, 2000. pp. 98-99 The unified Romanian state promoted a common identity for all its Romanian-speaking inhabitants. Owing partly to its relative underdevelopment compared to other regions of Greater Romania, as well as to the low competence and corruption of the new Romanian administration in this province, the integration process of Bessarabia in the unified Romanian state was less successful than in other regions and was soon to be disrupted by the Soviet occupation.Charles King, The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the politics of culture, Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, 2000Petrescu, Cristina. Contrasting/Conflicting Identities: Bessarabians, Romanians, Moldovans in Nation-Building and Contested identities: Romanian & Hungarian Case Studies. Editura Polirom. 2001. \\"The members of this overwhelmingly rural, mostly illiterate and quasi-immobile peasant population, who had no sense of national identification with the Romanians, but had idealized memories from the Tsarist period, found themselves overnight citizens of Romania. It was the transition from the Tsarist-type of local government to the Romanian-type of centralized modern state with a corrupt administration that alienated the Bessarabians, many of whom felt, as the interviewed persons bear witness, that they were rather occupied by their alleged brothers than united with them.\\" (page 157)Petrescu, Cristina. Contrasting/Conflicting Identities: Bessarabians, Romanians, Moldovans in Nation-Building and Contested identities: Romanian & Hungarian Case Studies. \\"The stories told by a group of Bessarabians coming from several villages of BƒÉl»õi county, who, it should be noted, chose to come to Romania instead of living under the Soviet regime, seems to suggest that their native region was the only province acquired after World War I where the Romanian central authorities did not succeed in integrating their own coethnics, among whom some even felt nostalgia for the Tsarist period. Although citizens of Greater Romania, a large majority of Bessarabians did not even begin to consider themselves part of the Romanian nation, going beyond their allegiance to regional and local ties.11 In short, as these oral history interviews reveal, during the interwar period, the Romanian homogenizing state failed in its attempt to transform the peasants of Bessarabia into Romanians.\\" (page 154) In 1940, during World War II, Romania agreed to an ultimatum and ceded the region to the Soviet Union, which organized it into the Moldavian SSR. The Soviets began a campaign to strengthen the Moldovan identity different from that of the rest of Romanian speakers, taking advantage of the incomplete integration of the Bessarabia into the interwar Romania (see also Moldovenism).King, The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the politics of culture; Mackinlay, pg. 135 The official Soviet policy also stated that Romanian and Moldovan were two different languages and, to emphasize this distinction, Moldovan had to be written in a new Cyrillic alphabet (the Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet) based on the Russian Cyrillic, rather than the older Romanian Cyrillic that ceased to be used in the 19th century in the Romanian Old Kingdom and 1917 in Bessarabia.Mackinlay, pg. 140 ==Identity and politics in the Republic of Moldova== A poll conducted in the Republic of Moldova by IMAS-Inc Chi»ôinƒÉu in October 2009 presented a detailed picture. The respondents were asked to rate the relationship between the identity of Moldovans and that of Romanians on a scale between 1 (entirely the same) to 5 (completely different). The poll showed that 26% of the entire sample, which included all ethnic groups, claimed the two identities were the same or very similar, whereas 47% claimed they were different or entirely different. The results varied significantly among different categories of subjects. For instance, while 33% of the young respondents (ages 18‚Äì29) chose the same or very similar and 44% different or very different, among the senior respondents (aged over 60) the corresponding figures were 18.5% and 53%. The proportion of those who chose the same or very similar identity was higher than the average among the native speakers of Romanian/Moldovan (30%), among the urban dwellers (30%), among those with higher education (36%), and among the residents of the capital city (42%). According to a study conducted in the Republic of Moldova in May 1998, when the self-declared Moldovans were asked to relate the Romanian and Moldovan identities, 55% considered them somewhat different, 26% very different and less than 5% identical.Pal Kolsto, Hans Olav Melberg National Integration and Violent Conflict in Post-Soviet Societies: The Cases of Estonia and Moldova, pg. 31-34, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2002, A survey carried out in the Republic of Moldova in 1992 showed that 87% of the Romanian/Moldovan speakers chose to identify themselves as \\"Moldovans\\", rather than \\"Romanians\\".Charles King, \\"The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the Politics of Culture\\", Hoover Press, 2000, pg. 159 The major Moldovan political forces have diverging opinions regarding the identity of Moldovans. This contradiction is reflected in their stance towards the national history that should be taught in schools. Governing forces such as the Liberal Party, Liberal Democratic Party, and Our Moldova Alliance support the teaching of the history of Romanians. Others, such as the Democratic Party and the Party of Communists support the history of the Republic of Moldova. The diverging opinions are also reflected in the official state documents issued in successive legislatures. The Declaration of Independence of 1991 calls the official language \\"Romanian\\", and the first anthem adopted by the independent Republic of Moldova was \\"De≈üteaptƒÉ-te, rom√¢ne\\" (\\"Awaken thee, Romanian!\\"), the same as the anthem of Romania. Mirroring different political configurations of the later Moldovan Parliament, the Constitution of Moldova (1994) calls the official language \\"Moldovan\\", while the \\"Concept of the National Policy of the Republic of Moldova\\" (2003)Gribincea A., Grecu, M. The Concept on National Policy of the Republic of Moldova UNHCR. adopted by the Communist-dominated Parliament distinguishes explicitly Moldovans and Romanians as ethnic groups, and so does the census of 2004. On December 5, 2013, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Moldova ruled that the Romanian language is the official language of this country, in agreement with the Declaration of Independence of 1991. ===Intellectuals of Moldova and the Romanian identity=== A significant number of intellectuals from the Bessarabia considered themselves part of the Romanian nation in the passing of time. Amongst these prominent figures, there are the following ones: * Alexei Mateevici (1888‚Äì1917), author of the Moldovan national anthem Limba noastrƒÉ said at a congress of Bessarabian teachers in 1917: \\"Yes, we are Moldovans, sons of the old Moldavia, but we belong to the large body of the Romanian nation, that lives in Romania, Bukovina and Transylvania. Our brothers from Bukovina, Transylvania and Macedonia don't call themselves after the places they live in, but call themselves Romanians. That is what we should do as well!\\"\\"Da, suntem moldoveni, fii ai vechii Moldove, √ÆnsƒÉ facem parte din marele trup al rom√¢nismului, a≈üezat prin Rom√¢nia, Bucovina ≈üi Transilvania. Fra≈£ii no≈ütri din Bucovina, Transilvania ≈üi Macedonia nu se numesc dupƒÉ locurile unde trƒÉiesc, ci-≈üi zic rom√¢ni. A≈üa trebuie sƒÉ facem ≈üi noi!\\" Alexei Mateevici, Opere, vol.

I think people come here not forced, but freely, for a return to their brothers.\\"Aici e capitala unirii ≈üi o adevƒÉratƒÉ Mecca [...] Cred cƒÉ lumea nu vine aici cu for≈£a ci din propria ini≈£iativƒÉ, pentru o √Æntoarcere la fra≈£i. * Gheorghe Duca (b. 1952), president of the Moldovan Academy of Sciences said: \\"Just like the whole Romanian nation, that Grigore Vieru praised, I cannot believe the Poet left home forever\\" *Constantin TƒÉnase (b. 1949), director of the Moldovan newspaper \\"Timpul de diminea»õƒÉ\\", one of the most influential opinion leaders from Moldova stated: \\"The academia, the political and cultural elite has to show that Romanianness in the Republic of Moldova is not an extremist whim, but a reality and a condition of the existence of this state.\\" The resolution of the \\"Association of Historians from the Republic of Moldova\\" (AIRM) from October 28, 2009 in favor of teaching the history of Romanians in Moldovan schools reads \\"The people of the Moldovan SSR were subjected to the Communist ideology, with the aim of replacing the Romanian identity of the native population, with one newly created\\"Popula≈£ia R.S.S.M. a fost supusƒÉ ideologiei comuniste, care avea scopul de a √Ænlocui identitatea rom√¢neascƒÉ, a majoritƒÉ»õii popula»õiei locale, cu alta, nou creatƒÉ. The welcome message of the Union of Writers from Moldova is a quote from Mircea Eliade: \\"We invite you to become initiated in the literary life of Bessarabia, border Romanian land subjected to a long, too long terror of history\\" The national poet of Moldova and Romania, Mihai Eminescu was born and lived outside of the territory of the current Republic of Moldova and considered himself Romanian. He is often quoted as saying \\"We are Romanians, period. (Suntem rom√¢ni ≈üi punct)\\". ==Demographics== The 2014 census reported an estimated 2,998,235 people (without Transnistria), out of which 2,804,801 were actually covered by the census. Among them, 2,068,068 or 73.7% declared themselves Moldovans and 192,800 or 6.9% Romanians. . Some organisations like the Liberal party of Moldova have criticised the census results, claiming Romanians comprise 85% of the population and that census officials have pressured respondents to declare themselves Moldovans instead of Romanians and have purposefully failed to cover urban respondents who are more likely to declare themselves Romanians as opposed to Moldovans. The previous 2004 census results reported that out of the 3,383,332 people living in Moldova (without Transnistria), 2,564,849 or 75.81% declared themselves Moldovans and only 73, 276 or 2.17% Romanians.National Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Moldova: 2004 Census results in Moldova A group of international observers considered the census was generally conducted in a professional manner, although they reported several cases when enumerators encouraged respondents to declare themselves Moldovans rather than Romanians.

Retrieved September 28, 2008, see also Experts Offering to Consult the National Statistics Bureau in Evaluation of the Census Data , Moldova Azi, May 19, 2005, story attributed to AP Flux. Retrieved January 21, 2009. The 2001 census in Ukraine counted 258,600 Moldovans and 150,989 Romanians. The self-identified Moldovans live mostly in the southern and northern areas of historical Bessarabia (specifically in the Budjak region of the Odessa oblast and in the Novoselytskyi Raion of Chernivtsi oblast), whereas the self-identified Romanians live mostly in Northern Bukovina and Hertza region of the Chernivtsi oblast. In Russia, 156,400 Moldovans have been counted in the 2010 Russian census. They are concentrated mostly in Moscow, but also in some rural areas in Kuban, southern Siberia, and the Russian Far East, where they were deported generations ago. Around 14,000 Moldovans live in Kazakhstan, mostly in the former capital Almaty, but also in some rural areas in the northern parts of the country (another destination of Soviet deportations).

The river Moldova (possibly, the origin of the name of the Principality, see Etymology of Moldova) now flows entirely through Romania. After the Russian annexation of Bessarabia in 1812, and Austrian annexation of Bukovina in 1775, the rest of Moldova united with Wallachia and formed the modern Romania. In 1998, Constantin Simirad, the former mayor of Ia≈üi founded the Party of the Moldavians (Partidul Moldovenilor) which later joined the Social Democratic Party. However, the party's declared objective was to represent the interests of the Moldavia region in Romania rather than any ethnic identification. According to the Romanian census of 2002, there are 4.7 million Romanian speakers in the eight counties that were once part of the Principality of Moldavia. The number of people, if any, who possibly declared themselves as Moldovans in this census is impossible to know, since \\"Moldovan\\" is officially considered a regional identity in Romania.The Handbook of the Census Staff, 2001, at UNECE website The Romanian-speaking inhabitants of these counties generally refer to themselves as \\"Moldavians\\", but declare Romanian ethnicity.Vladimir Socor: \\"Official Chisinau Seeks Recognition Of Moldovan Ethnicity And Minority In Romania\\" The Jamestown Foundation, February 28, 2007 In February 2007, a small group of Romanian citizens who created the \\"Moldovan/Moldavian Community in Romania\\" (Comunitatea moldovenilor din Rom√¢nia) attempted unsuccessfully to gain recognition of the minority status for Moldovans from Romania. The organization was initially registered legally, but the decision was soon reverted. Around the same time, during a visit to Moldova, three delegates met with President Vladimir Voronin, who promised them his support. Being denied legal recognition the Community eventually dissolved. In Romania, the Moldovans from Bessarabia region (contemporary Republic of Moldova included) are usually called Bessarabians (basarabeni) in order to distinguish them from the inhabitants of Eastern Romania. ==Religion in Moldova== The major denomination in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity. The majority of Moldovan Orthodox Christians belong to the Moldovan Orthodox Church, a branch of the Russian Orthodox Church, while a minority belongs to the Metropolis of Bessarabia, a branch of the Romanian Orthodox Church. Both bodies are in full communion, the dispute between them being purely territorial and revolves around the legitimate succession of the interwar Metropolitan See of Bessarabia. As of 2007, the Moldovan Orthodox Church has 1255 parishes, while the Metropolis of Bessarabia has 219.International Religious Freedom Report 2007, by the US Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor ==See also== * Ethnogenesis * Romanian dialects * Movement for the unification of Romania and Moldova * Moldovan diaspora * Moldovan Americans * Moldovan Canadians * Moldovans in Ukraine ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Matthew H.

The school was established in 1989, and is located at Jongno-gu, Seoul. It was established as one of the 'Science High Schools' in Republic of Korea. In 2009, it has become an 'Academy for Gifted Students' selected by the Ministry of Education of Korea. Now, it is one of the eight such academies in Republic of Korea. The school is famous for its rigorous selection process in the search for the most gifted students among the top middle school graduate applicants from all over the nation. Before the transition, there were about 180 students in each grade. The general program was a three-year course, but an early graduation program existed. About one-third of sophomore students graduated one year earlier than the typical high school students in Korea. After the transition to an 'Academy for Gifted Students', the number of the students admitted each year was reduced to approximately 125, and the curriculum was modified to fulfill the need and curiosity of students better. The new curriculum includes the following: * Non-graded, credit-based graduation system * Strengthening research activities to develop creativity * Interdisciplinary curriculum == Purpose of establishment == The school was switched from a 'Science High School' to an 'Academy for Gifted Students' according to the procedures set out in Enforcement Decree of the Gifted Education Promotion Law Act Article 19. As stated in the article 12 of the same law, a person who meets the following conditions is defined as a gifted * 1.Those who are recognized as having a certain level of talent or potential above a specific subject or in a specific field, according to the method of standardized intelligence test, thinking ability test, creative problem-solving ability test, or any other method of inspection, interview or observation. * 2.Those who are recognized to have a certain level of talent or potential in the artistic and physical fields according to methods such as inspection, interview, or observation other than practical examination. In accordance with Article 1 of the Gifted Education Promotion Law, the purpose of SSHS is to make early identification of talented people and early education of their talents and abilities which will develop the natural potential of the individual, promote self-realization of the individual, and contribute to the development of the nation and society. == Focusing on advanced courses == * Geared to the level and aptitude of each individual * Various programs for whole-person education * No obligation to complete the curriculum of general high schools * Differentiated selection process Student recruitment is done nationwide, and multiple applications to other special high schools are allowed. Unlike general high schools, students study the‚Äòrequired courses‚Äôin their 1st grade, and have an opportunity to choose‚Äòadvanced courses‚Äôin their 2nd and 3rd grades. In order to achieve graduation, a student must fulfill 170 credits in overall course work, which consists of 140 credits in academic courses and 30 credits in research. Also, the student must fulfill at least 240 hours on special activities: 120 hours on group activity, and 120 hours of volunteer work. The university-level courses are accepted as Advanced Placement credit at KAIST, POSTECH, UNIST, GIST, and DGIST. The school is famous for many national and international Science Olympiad participants and medal winners. Usually, a quarter to a half of the Korean participants in the International Science Olympiads is from Seoul Science High School for Gifted Students. Graduates from this school typically enter Seoul National University, KAIST, and POSTECH. Some students enroll to colleges abroad such as MIT, Caltech, UC Berkeley, Stanford, Harvard, and Cornell. Many alumni have undertaken graduate studies at top institutions in Korea, U.S., and Europe after earning their bachelor's degrees. The school motto is \\"Intelligence and Righteous Action\\" (ÏòàÏßÄÏùòÌñâ, Âè°Êô∫Áæ©Ë°å).

Students use this building after 11 pm when they finish their study in Yeji building. Boys use 3rd ~ 5th floor, and girls use 2nd floor. Usually, 2nd graders use the 3rd and 4th floor, and 1st graders use the 5th floor. There is a terrace beside the 5th floor, and there is a path through the new building for 3rd graders who have none or less penalty points than others. The 2nd floor is for cafeteria and girl's dormitory, but it is also used for people who control and take care of students using dormitory. Students should turn off all the lights by 1:00 am and they are supposed to wake up in 7:00 am. Sometimes students who did not wake up at 7:00 am get penalty points. === Yeji Building === The Yeji building is the main building of Seoul Science High school. It is placed in the center of the school, and is a four-story building. The building is named after the school motto, Yeji which means manners and wisdom. The first floor is mostly occupied with departments for the management of the school such as the administration office, and the principal's office. There are also valuable scientific instruments such as the Wind Tunnel and 3D printer, and classroom about invention at the first floor. The second floor is for Earth science; it has laboratories and lecture rooms. It also has a study hall which connects the Yeji building to the library and the Fusion talent building. The study hall allows the students to do their work in their free time and the study hours after school. There is also a small classroom where students can use their laptops for researching and making presentations. The third floor has a gym and lecture rooms, laboratories for physics. There are instruments such as the high-speed camera and the forward-looking infrared. There are laboratories and lecture rooms for biology and room for SEM on the fourth floor. The biology laboratory is full of scientific instruments. There is an observatory on the rooftop which the largest telescope in Seoul.

Since about 2000 to 2006, it was used as a warehouse. but, since 2006, Aram building had been Abandoned architecture for 10 years. But, it remodeled to a sports building in September, 2016 and deserved a name, Aram. The building's name, Aram, comes from a name of a school newspaper-pubulishing regular club, Hanaram. It is a remote building, even more deserted than the Wu-am building. It located on the side of a schoolyard where a recycling bin located. There are six table tennis tables, an indoor driving range, two running machines, a situp bench, and some strength exercising machines and bathroom which was also remodeled. There is also a personal indoor driving range separated to the indoor driving range used by students. The personal indoor driving range is usually used by P.E teacher. There is a parking lot on the rooftop. P.E classes are usually held in the building. They learn how to play golf and play table tennis in the classes. There are always a plenty of students playing a table tennis in their free time, including students belong to LA, a table tennis Irregular club. === Wu-am Building === Wu-am building is a four-story building. Wu-am is a pen name of Si-yeol Song, a famous civil minister of The Kingdom of Joseon. In front of the building, there is a famous rock named Thousand Years Rock. There is Chinese characters carved by Si-yeol Song on the rock. The rock is also a symbol of the school. There are also Statue of Jang Yeong-sil and a statue named 'a Site of Creation' in front of the building. Jang Yeoung-sil is a famous inventor of The Kingdom of Joseon who invented Joseon's first rain gauge. Wu-am building is a remote building. It is located on the hill and also far from Uihaeng building and Yeji building, the main buildings of the school. But, there are several important classrooms such as Korean classrooms, math classrooms, and social studies classrooms in the building. This path also has a cover that protect students from rain on it. In the first floor of the building, there are audiovisual room and a multipurpose classroom. In the second floor, there are some multipurpose classrooms and a teachers' rooms. One of the teachers' rooms in the second floor of Wu-am building is a biggest teachers' room in the school. Also, there is a big stairway that we can use to go second floor directly from outside of the building. In the third floor, there are math lecture rooms and an office for math teachers. In the forth floor, there are Korean lecture rooms and social studies lecture rooms and some multipurpose classrooms and an office for social studies teachers and Korean teachers. The building has two stairs, one on the left side and the other on the right side. In addition, on the center of the building, there is a bathroom.  1st floor  {  R&E; room wu-am common classroom 4  Audio-visual room warehouse }  2nd floor  {  Art preparation room Art room Admissions Department Wu-am Common Classroom 2 School office rest area Wu-am Common Classroom 1 }  3rd floor  {  Alumni hall Mathematics Lecture Room 7 Mathematics Lecture Room 6 Mathematics Lecture Room 5 Mathematics Lecture Room 4 Mathematics Lecture Room 3 Mathematics Lecture Room 2 Mathematics Lecture Room 1 Mathematical Office Mathematical reference Room }  4th floor  {  Social Resource Room Social Lecture Room 1 Social Lecture Room 2 Social Lecture Room 3 Korean Language Lecture Room 3 Korean Language Lecture Room 2 Korean Language Lecture Room 1 Humanities - Society Office Humanities - Society reference Room } === Yunghap-Injaegwan(ÏúµÌï©Ïù∏Ïû¨Í¥Ä) === Fusion talent building is a building that is located right in front of the school gate. Instead of the first floor, it is connected with the Uihaeng building. This building has an elevator. On the first floor, there is a teachers' room and music room, and there are an English room and library on the second floor. In the case of the advice room, it is very free that many students use the advise room. The library is connected with the Yeji building and study hall. Above the third floor, there is a guest room which is used for visitors from other schools. On the 4th and 5th floors, there is a male dormitory and is called a new dormitory. They have to pass through the Uihaeng building to go to their dormitory because they have to do an attendance check in the 2nd floor of the Uihaeng Building. So they cannot use the elevator or stairs in that building to go to their dormitory except on Monday morning and Friday afternoon. 5th floor male dormitory for 3rd graders 4th floor male dormitory for 3rd graders 3rd floor Guest House, Fusion Common classroom 2, Fusion Common classroom 3, Fusion Common classroom 4, Fusion Common classroom 5 2nd floor Advise room, Foreign language Lecture room 1, Foreign language Lecture Room 2, Foreign language Lecture Room 3, Foreign language Lecture Room 4, Foreign language Lecture Room 5, Foreign language Lecture Room 6, Foreign language Office, Foreign language reference room, English Communication room 1st floor Connection room, Music Office, Music Lecture Room, Parent's waiting room, Facilities Management Office, Guard's room, Music play room, Fusion Common classroom 1, 3rd students' teachers' room, College Counseling Office === Changui-Injaegwan(Ï∞ΩÏùòÏù∏Ïû¨Í¥Ä) === It is next to the schoolyard. Because the schoolyard is in a low place, this building is also very low. Because of this building, the schoolyard became smaller. It also has an elevator as well as Fusion talent building. In the first floor we have a lecture room and computer room for information class, and It has chemistry lecture room and laboratories on the second and third floors. There is a big auditorium which has 300 seats. 4th floor Auditorium 3rd floor Chemistry laboratory 1, Chemistry Office 2, Chemistry laboratory 2, Chemistry Prepare room, Chemistry Reagent room, Chemistry Lecture Room 3 2nd floor Chemistry Lecture Room 1, Chemistry Lecture Room 2, Chemistry Office 1, Chemistry R&E; room, Chemistry instruments room, Club Room 1st floor Server room, Computer Science Office, Computer Laboratory 1, Computer Laboratory 2, Computer Science Prepare room, Computer Science Lecture Room == Daily life == Wake up At the sound of a morning wake-up song at 6:57, the students have to go outside of their dormitories and participate in a roll call. Anyone who is late receives 1 penalty point, and anyone who fails to go out receives 2 penalty points. If the weather is rainy or bad, the roll call is done in the cafeteria. After the roll call, students can go back to their dormitories and get ready for breakfast or go back to sleep. Failure to leave the dormitory before 8:10 results in 1 penalty point. Class and Between Class Each of the subjects has their own classroom, so students have to go to their class during break time and get ready for the next class. It is similar to college. Second and third graders have \\"between classes.\\" In the between classes, students can spend time however they want, with their teacher's permission. Free time From 4:20 to 7:00, students are given free time. 5:30 to 6:40 is supper time. With the permission of a primary teacher, students can go outside of the school. Students have to write the reason for going out: ‚Äòto buy underwear‚Äô, ‚Äòbecause of illness‚Äô etc. Study hour From 7:00 to 9:00, it is the first study hour. Students can study at the study hall or use the room for between classes to complete assignments. The containable number of people in rooms for the between classes is limited. For first graders it is 30, and for second and third graders it is 40. After the first study hour, students are given a thirty-minute break time. They usually go the cafeteria to get their snacks. From 9:30 to 11:00, there is a second study hour. Students have to study at the study hall. They come out of the study hall at about 10:45 because the study hall door closes at 11:00 sharp. Night life After going into the dormitory, there is no more roll call. Students can act freely. However, they can't take in laptops, food, cards, or board games. After 12 o'clock, students can't stay at other students' dormitories. After 1, they have to turn lights off. If a student is caught in another dormitory or with lights on after that time, they will get 1 penalty point. Also, if a student is caught bringing in a laptop, they will get 5 penalty points. Students who want to study can use a portable light stand or go to the lobby, where they can study freely. Also, the cafeteria is open until 1 o' clock for students who need to use laptops. == Olympiads  Olympiads === A large portion of SSHS students studies math or science olympiads. The majority of students prepare for Math and Physics Olympiads, but there are a few students who prepare for other Olympiads such as Chemistry or Biology. === Mathematics Olympiad (MO) === Many students start studying Olympiads with MO, so SSHS students are good in math. There are 6 members of the national team in MO, and 5~6 students are always from SSHS. Approximately Half of the members are in third grade, and the rest of the members are in second grade or occasionally in first grade, too. About 60 students get a gold medal in IMO, and 2~5 students in SSHS get a gold medal every year. Especially, in 2017, six members of the national representatives were all SSHS, and all received a gold medal. === Physics Olympiad(PhO) === PhO is normally the most popular Olympiad in SSHS, mostly because its problems are directly related to what they learn in school. The people who get the best scores in Korean Pho becomes the Korean representatives. The Korean representative team normally consists of one first grader and four second graders. For the past 10 years, at least half of the Korean representatives are from SSHS. === Chemistry Olympiad(ChO) === Chemistry Olympiad is separated in First grade class and Second grade class. It is hard to be a member of the national team in second grade because the gap of level of knowledge is big between grades. Chemistry Olympiad has Summer school and Winter school. Students study General chemistry in First grade class Summer school, and Organic chemistry in First grade class Winter school. Students study intensive course of General chemistry in Second grade class. MO and PO are more popular than Chemistry Olympiad, but still 3 out of the 4 members of the IChO national team are students of the SSHS. === Informatics Olympiad(OI) === IOI is an annual competitive programming competition for secondary school students. It is the second largest Olympiad, after International Mathematical Olympiad, in terms of the number of participating countries. However, in comparison to the size of the contest, the number of SSHS students who prepare IOI is small in comparison to other Olympiads. Most of these students are third graders. There are many reasons for this phenomenon, but the most known reason is that the support of the school is weak. Gyeonggi Science High School supports the students much better for the Olympiad in Informatics. Despite the lack of support, in 2018, the national team includes two students from each school; Seoul Gyeonggi Science High. === Other Olympiads === There are many other olympiads such as Linguistics Olympiad, Biology Olympiad, or Brain Science Olympiad, but there are not as many students who prepare for these contests. == Club activity  Regular club === Each person can go in only one regular club, which means each regular club has about 5‚Äì7 people each. Depending on the popularity, which is determined by the result of the prior survey, clubs are divided into three groups: Ga group, Na group, and Da group. Da group is the most popular group. Regular club selection is done over three days; Ga group on the first day, Na group on the second day, Da group on the third. The following list shows the list of all regular clubs in 2018.

Eureka  Eureka is a club that writes English articles. However, it also does mathematical activities, too. The entrance exam of Eureka also includes mathematical problems. === Irregular Club === There is no limit in the number of irregular clubs one can join. Irregular clubs can be divided into three big fields: sports club, scholarly clubs, amd performance clubs. The selection of new club members are done normally 4 times (each semester in first and second grade), by a test made by 11th graders. Sports Clubs: SD (soccer club), TP (basketball club), LA (ping- pong club), PS (badminton club), PG (baseball club), morning soccer club. Scholarly clubs: science discussion club, MAGnolia (life science mentoring club), M&J; (Math Magazine research club), CALGeN (mathematics mentoring club), Aerospace (aviation membership club), Chela (chemistry mentoring club), MWT (computer science mentoring club), LTE (long term experiment) SSHS Mechatronics, Artificial Neutral Network (HABE), Star# (physics mentoring club), SMS (mathematics problem research club), SEM (economics study club), VIPS (patent club). Performance clubs: M (magic club), Ocarina (ocarina club), Caritas (orchestra club), Livian (ballad club), MIC (hip-hop club), Ssangdre (Band Club), Our Sound (Korean traditional music club), Klavier (piano club), You Can (boy dance club), Depression (abbv. Deep, Girl-Dressed Boy dance club), LSD (Launch Pad Club). Others: Milalhoe (Christian club), WYW (What You Want, design club), Shadows (cartoon drawing club), Letters (literature club), TNT (composition and rhythm game club), board game club (BGM), Manifold (origami club) == Curriculum  Grades === All classes and assessments at the school are operated on a credit system and students can choose the course you want, like universities and other gifted schools. However, all subjects are absolute assessments. That is, if the score is 90 or more, A + is given. If the score is 85 or more, and less than 90, A0 is given. If the score is 80 or more, and less than 85, A- is given. Since then, grades have been divided into 5 points. In addition, all the arts and physical education semesters are pass/fail system, and receive a pass if the score exceeds 60 out of 100 points. If the grade of any subject is less than B0 or Fail, you can apply for re-entry. Students can apply for a maximum of four times per student per class and up to B+ per class if they retake classes. === Enrollment === All courses fall into three categories: required courses with scheduled classes, required courses to choose when classes are taken, and elective courses. Applications are accepted every June and November. Unlike college, this school receives a course enrollment and then schedules a timetable according to the number of students. A minimum of 10 credits and a maximum of 29 credits are allowed per semester. If the number of applicants for any subject is less than seven, the subject is discarded. Also one class enter up to 20 people. There is also a hierarchy between subjects. For example, to apply for Advanced Chemistry I, a student must have already completed Chemistry I, II, and III. Since students do not enroll in the first grade, the credit is fixed (first semester 30 credits, second semester 29 credits). In the second year, there will be individual differences but generally most of students get 25‚Äì29 credits per semester. In the third grade, the individual differences become more pronounced. Usually, about 40 credits are allocated to the first and second semesters. There are about 6‚Äì15 hours between classes.

Entrance test of Seoul Science High School In the Republic of Korea, it is illegal for standard high schools to have their own entrance test. However, Seoul Science High School belongs to the special law for education, ‚ÄúAct on the Promotion of Specific Education for Brilliant Children‚Äù, which allows it to have the right to examine the candidates. The entrance test of SSHS can be divided into three parts. #1 Evaluation of student record The first step is evaluation of student record. Teachers of SSHS get to read applicants‚Äô student record and letters of self-introduction. Then, they judge whether the applicants are eager to study science and have enough giftedness. #2 Examination test The applicants who pass this step are allowed to take the second step, which is examination. In this step, the students need to take exams for three period in order to prove that they are smart enough to enter the school. In the first period, the exam is used for examining students‚Äô ability in various aspects. During the second and third period, students are rated for their specialties in math and science. The students who show very decent talents are specially allowed to enter this school without taking third exam, and this system is called prior selection. #3 Camp for gifted For the last, the students who passed second exam are required to take the last exam, which is taken in a form of camp. During this camp, students interview, work in teams to solve their tasks, or plan and carry out experiment on their own. After all of these steps, about 120 students are able to enter the Seoul Science High School. 2\\\\. The transition of trends in entrance test Since entrance test have been had its effect, its difficulty has been increased steadily. And, the style of test problems are slowly turning into types that requires people for their creativeness. And also, there was a big change in systems of this entrance test just a year ago. The major change was held in the second test, exam. In the past, students whoever shows special quality in their studying ability was selected priorly. But, it has been changed into rules that only one student per states was allowed to be selected through this system. It seems to be in purpose of giving students from countrysides more chance of getting favored by this system. Also, the third step which is scientific camp has slightly changed in its program. They had eliminated interview about applicants‚Äô ability of solving problems, and instead they added some kind of creativity test or activities that can evaluate their abilities of teamwork. == Thousand Years Festival == It is a festival of Seoul Science High School and is held for two days in the middle of December every year. Every student enjoys the festival because it's held after the final exams, task research, R&E;, and college entrance examinations all ended. Most regular clubs organize their own booths, and some clubs replace their booths by producing editions or newspapers. Performance clubs such as Between Act and Scene, Deep, Ssangdre, Livian, Our Voice, MIC, and M perform at the festival. The festival theme is selected each year through a student idea contest, and posters for festival are selected through the contests too. Most posters are produced by WYW, the design club. == Websites  Thousand Years Rock === Thousand Years Rock is the website of alumni society of Seoul Science High School that all junior students are encouraged to join. The occasional questions about studying abroad, college counseling and textbooks are mostly posted on the site. Birthday and anniversary celebrations, obituaries, and job postings also come up. === Facebook === Seoul Science High School's enrolled students mostly communicate with Facebook. Student council uses Facebook pages to inform students about school occasions. On ‚ÄúSSHS student council notice‚Äù page, information like special lectures, happiness enhancement programs, buying school jumper, gathering opinions and informing changes of school rules, encouraging to join circles, etc. are posted. On ‚ÄúSSHS bamboo forest‚Äù page, students post their unconstrained thoughts and opinions anonymously. On ‚ÄúSSHS Lost & Found Center‚Äù page, students post things they lost and where they've lost it. They also post things they found. There are pages for each grade and the pages that former grades lead their juniors. The chairpersons of regular and irregular clubs introduce their club on the page and irregular clubs gather participants for their club, too. There are many pages of clubs, which they post their works. For example, ‚ÄúSSHS broadcasting club SBS‚Äù page posts weekly rising songs, ‚ÄúSSHS newspaper club Hanaram‚Äù page posts their articles, ‚ÄúSSHS Livian‚Äù page posts videos of their songs, and ‚ÄúSSHS literary creation club Letters‚Äù posts their poems or writings. Students also autonomously make some pages that posts information related to Seoul Science High School students, such as the ‚ÄúDongsPatch‚Äù page, which post them in forms of Internet news article. There are also pages related to social issues such as racism, feminism, etc. Some make pages that posts mathematical or scientific facts or problems, such as ‚ÄúTeam Wooden Compass‚Äù page that posts daily mathematical problems. There are also many pages for promoting friendship. There are pages for posting friends' pictures. == Notable alumni == *Kim Seung-chan, scientist and 2009 Talent Medal of Korea honoree *Lee Jun-seok *Moon Taeil, member of K-pop group NCT and its subunits NCT U and NCT 127 == See also == * Gyeonggi Science High School * Daejeon Science High School * Daegu Science High School * Gwangju Science High School * Korea Science Academy of KAIST * Hansung Science High School * Sejong Science High School == References  External links == * Seoul Science High School website (English) * Alumni Website \\"Ï≤úÎÖÑÎ∞îÏúÑ\\"(Thousand Years Rock) (CUG) hn Category:Science high schools in South Korea Category:Educational institutions established in 1989 Category:High schools in Seoul Category:Boarding schools in South Korea ","title":"Seoul Science High School"},{"id":"2232018","text":"300px These fraternities are all members of the Cartellverband.

Baker drew, colored, lettered and, with Elizabeth Glass, wrote the 10-page story. In the story, the super-toddler climbs into a microwave oven. When Paul Levitz, the president of DC Comics, objected to this portrayal of the infant Clark Kent, most copies were recalled and pulped. DC destroyed all copies of the issue intended for the North American market, though copies were still distributed in Europe.Elseworlds 80-Page Giant #1 (August 1999) at the Grand Comics Database ==Collected editions== In May 2001 the story was reprinted in the Bizarro Comics hardcover ().

The story revolves around the relationship between two men who travel from California, aiming to start a business in Pittsburgh. At the 1973 Cannes Film Festival, it tied for the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film, the highest honor. While it did poorly commercially, it later gained cult status. ==Plot== Two vagabonds, Max Millan, a short-tempered ex-convict, and Francis Lionel \\"Lion\\" Delbuchi, a childlike ex-sailor, meet on the road in California and agree to become partners in a car wash business, once they reach Pittsburgh. Lion is on his way to Detroit to see the child he has never met and make amends with his wife Annie, whom he has been sending all the money he made while at sea. Max agrees to make a detour on his way to Pittsburgh, where the bank that Max has been sending all his seed money is located. While visiting Max's sister in Denver, the pair's antics land them in a prison farm for a month. Max blames Lion for their being sent back to jail and shuns him. Lion is befriended by a powerful inmate named Riley, who later tries to sexually assault Lion, and while not succeeding, physically savages and emotionally traumatizes him. Max rekindles his friendship with Lion, and becomes his protector, eventually exacting revenge by beating up Riley. After being released from prison, the two continue to have a profound effect on each other, although they have both undergone personal transformations and their roles have shifted‚Äîwith Lion still traumatized and no longer carefree and clowning nor able even to laugh or even smile, and Max loosening his high-strung aggression (at one point doing a tongue-in-cheek striptease to defuse a fight at a bar and to attempt to make Lion laugh again). When the duo finally arrive in Detroit, Lion finds a payphone and calls Annie, now remarried and raising their five-year-old son. Annie is still furious at Lion for having abandoned her, and lies that she miscarried their son (adding spitefully, knowing Lion is Catholic, \\"He never even got born. Never got baptized. You know what that means; his soul can't go to heaven. That's what you did for your son's soul, you bastard. You sent it into limbo. That soul cannot go to heaven\\"). Lion is devastated, as is Annie when he hangs up after hearing the \\"news.\\" When he gets off the phone, he acts overjoyed with Max about having a son. Shortly afterward, Lion has a breakdown while playing in a city park with children and later on becomes catatonic. Max promises Lion, now in a psychiatric hospital, that he will do anything to help him, and boards a train to Pittsburgh with a round-trip ticket. ==Cast== * Gene Hackman as Max Millan * Al Pacino as Francis \\"Lionel\\" Delbuchi * Eileen Brennan as Darlene * Dorothy Tristan as Coley * Ann Wedgeworth as Frenchy * Richard Lynch as Riley * Penelope Allen as Annie Gleason * Richard Hackman as Mickey Grenwood * Al Cingolani as Skipper * Rutanya Alda as Woman in camp ==Production== Gene Hackman was Jerry Schatzberg's choice for the role of Max, and went begging with Al Pacino to develop the performances. Warner Bros. approved the project, looking for a small-budget film after executives became less confident in the success of larger projects. Director Jerry Schatzberg's preference for the roles of Max and Lion were Gene Hackman and Al Pacino, and Schatzberg previously had worked with Pacino on The Panic in Needle Park (1971). To understand their characters, Pacino and Hackman costumed themselves and went begging in San Francisco. However, Pacino, an advocate of method acting, found his techniques conflicted with Hackman, who would be silent before shooting while Pacino paced. Although Hackman had fun with the production, Pacino later commented, \\"It wasn't the easiest working with Hackman, who I love as an actor\\". ==Reception== At the 1973 Cannes Film Festival, the film won the equivalent of the Palme d'Or of later years, the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film, shared with The Hireling directed by Alan Bridges. It also won Best Non-European Film at Denmark's 1974 Bodil Awards. In the U.S., Scarecrow proved to be a box office bomb. In 1973, Roger Ebert gave it three stars, comparing the story to Of Mice and Men and Midnight Cowboy, and positively reviewed the performances of Pacino and Hackman, the writing and setting. In The New York Times, Vincent Canby called Max and Lion \\"classic drifters\\" and \\"marvelously realized characters\\". In a review of the film from the time of its 2013 re-release, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described the film as \\"a freewheeling masterpiece\\", describing Hackman and Pacino as giving \\"the performances of their lives\\". Peter Biskind, on the other hand, described the film as being of \\"secondary\\" significance in his book Easy Riders, Raging Bulls. Scarecrow has a 75% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 24 reviews. By 2012, Scarecrow was the best-reviewed film in Schatzberg's career. After gaining a cult following, Schatzberg had Seth Cohen write a sequel, with a screenplay completed by 2013. It would be set years later, with Max and computer worker Lion reuniting, and Lion learning his son is alive. The film sequel was made difficult, if not impossible, by the studio's lack of support and Hackman's retirement from acting. ==See also== * List of American films of 1973 ==References* * Category:1973 films Category:1973 drama films Category:1970s drama road movies Category:American buddy drama films Category:American films Category:American prison films Category:American drama road movies Category:Films about homelessness Category:Films directed by Jerry Schatzberg Category:Films set in California Category:Films set in Colorado Category:Films set in Detroit Category:Films shot in California Category:Films shot in Colorado Category:Films shot in Michigan Category:Films shot in Nevada Category:Palme d'Or winners Category:Warner Bros. films ","title":"Scarecrow (1973 film)"},{"id":"2232040","text":"Ab≈´ 'Ubayd al-J≈´zjƒÅnƒ´, (d.1070),Science, Medicine and Technology, Ahmad Dallal, The Oxford History of Islam, ed.

It changed its name in 1995 to reflect the changing aspirations of its members, but retained its original acronym. ==History== Peter Austin was the prime mover in establishing SIBA, and was the group's first chairman.

Such a system was eventually adopted by then-Chancellor Gordon Brown. ==Current status== With growing credibility and campaigning success, SIBA has come to represent the broad spectrum of the UK independent brewing sector. There is no longer a ceiling on membership and SIBA. In 2010, The Guardian reported that SIBA members had seen sales rise by 4% in 2009, and smaller members, who brew fewer than 350 barrels per week who constitute the vast majority of SIBA's membership, saw volume sales rise by 8.5%. ==Activities== SIBA aims to ensure that its members' products are of high quality, and membership is conditional upon adhering to the Code of Practice and By-Laws. SIBA has previously attended the Great British Beer Festival (GBBF) with a bar showcasing the winners of that year's SIBA National Beer Competition.

She is also an Affiliate Professor at the University of Washington Information School. Before joining Microsoft in 1997, Dumais was a researcher at Bellcore (now Telcordia Technologies), where she and her colleagues conducted research into what is now called the vocabulary problem in information retrieval. Their study demonstrated, through a variety of experiments, that different people use different vocabulary to describe the same thing, and that even choosing the \\"best\\" term to describe something is not enough for others to find it. One implication of this work is that because the author of a document may use different vocabulary than someone searching for the document, traditional information retrieval methods will have limited success. Dumais and the other Bellcore researchers then began investigating ways to build search systems that avoided the vocabulary problem. The result was their invention of Latent Semantic Indexing. ==Awards== In 2006, Dumais was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. In 2009, she received the Gerard Salton Award, an information retrieval lifetime achievement award. In 2011, she was inducted to the National Academy of Engineering for innovation and leadership in organizing, accessing, and interacting with information.

The word, Subahdar is of Persian origin. The Subahdar was the head of the Mughal provincial administration.

Nazim is the title in Urdu of the chief elected official of a local government in Pakistan, such as a district, tehsil, union council, or village council. Likewise, a deputy mayor is known as a Naib nazim (). The word naib in Urdu literally means \\"assistant\\" or \\"deputy\\" hence Naib nazim is similar in function to a deputy mayor.Zila Nazims & Naib Zila Nazims in the Province of NWFP - NRB Local Government Elections He is also custodian of the house.Overview of Town Municipal Administration - City Government of Lahore The name which is used for the president of Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, the Islamic Union of Students in Pakistan, is Nazim-e-ala. The nazim-e-ala is elected for one year, and after completing that tenure, all the members of IJT who are called (Arkaan) elect a new one. The \\"chief nazim,\\" or district nazim, is elected by the nazims of Union Councils, Union Councillors, and Tehsil Nazims, who themselves are elected directly by the votes of the local public. Pakistan originally had a system inherited from the time of British rule, in which a mayor was the head of a district. Under the Local Government Act, however, the role of the nazim became distinct from that of a mayor, with more power. The nazim system was introduced after the commissionerate system, imposed during British rule, was lifted by the government of Pakistan. Now there is no commissioner for any of the divisions, deputy commissioner for the districts, or assistant commissioners, since the Local Government act was imposed in the country in 2001. One exception, however, is Islamabad, the federal capital, where the commissionerate system remains in effect. In 2009, the new government restored the commissionerate system in the divisions but the nazims also remain in power. A Nazim is also empowered to decide criminal cases.

Lutein is synthesized only by plants, and like other xanthophylls is found in high quantities in green leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale and yellow carrots. In green plants, xanthophylls act to modulate light energy and serve as non-photochemical quenching agents to deal with triplet chlorophyll (an excited form of chlorophyll), which is overproduced at very high light levels, during photosynthesis. See xanthophyll cycle for this topic. Animals obtain lutein by ingesting plants. In the human retina, lutein is absorbed from blood specifically into the macula lutea, although its precise role in the body is unknown. Lutein is also found in egg yolks and animal fats. Lutein is isomeric with zeaxanthin, differing only in the placement of one double bond. Lutein and zeaxanthin can be interconverted in the body through an intermediate called meso-zeaxanthin. The principal natural stereoisomer of lutein is (3R,3‚Ä≤R,6‚Ä≤R)-beta,epsilon- carotene-3,3‚Ä≤-diol. Lutein is a lipophilic molecule and is generally insoluble in water. The presence of the long chromophore of conjugated double bonds (polyene chain) provides the distinctive light-absorbing properties. The polyene chain is susceptible to oxidative degradation by light or heat and is chemically unstable in acids. Lutein is present in plants as fatty-acid esters, with one or two fatty acids bound to the two hydroxyl-groups. For this reason, saponification (de-esterfication) of lutein esters to yield free lutein may yield lutein in any ratio from 1:1 to 1:2 molar ratio with the saponifying fatty acid. ==As a pigment== This xanthophyll, like its sister compound zeaxanthin, has primarily been used in food and supplement manufacturing as a colorant due to its yellow-red color. Lutein absorbs blue light and therefore appears yellow at low concentrations and orange-red at high concentrations. Many songbirds (like golden oriole, evening grosbeak, yellow warbler, common yellowthroat and Javan green magpie, but not American goldfinch or yellow canariesMary E. Rawles, \\"The Integumentary System\\", in A. J. Marshall (ed.), 2012, \\"Biology and Comparative Physiology of Birds\\", vol. 1, p. 220. .) deposit lutein obtained from the diet into growing tissues to color their feathers. ==Role in human eyes== Although lutein is concentrated in the macula - a small area of the retina responsible for three-color vision - the precise functional role of retinal lutein has not been determined. ===Macular degeneration=== In 2013, findings of the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that a dietary supplement formulation containing lutein reduced progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by 25 percent. However, lutein and zeaxanthin had no overall effect on preventing AMD, but rather \\"the participants with low dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin at the start of the study, but who took an AREDS formulation with lutein and zeaxanthin during the study, were about 25 percent less likely to develop advanced AMD compared with participants with similar dietary intake who did not take lutein and zeaxanthin.\\" In AREDS2, participants took one of four AREDS formulations: the original AREDS formulation, AREDS formulation with no beta-carotene, AREDS with low zinc, AREDS with no beta-carotene and low zinc. In addition, they took one of four additional supplement or combinations including lutein and zeaxanthin (10 mg and 2 mg), omega-3 fatty acids (1,000 mg), lutein/zeaxanthin and omega-3 fatty acids, or placebo. The study reported that there was no overall additional benefit from adding omega-3 fatty acids or lutein and zeaxanthin to the formulation. However, the study did find benefits in two subgroups of participants: those not given beta-carotene, and those who had little lutein and zeaxanthin in their diets. Removing beta- carotene did not curb the formulation's protective effect against developing advanced AMD, which was important given that high doses of beta-carotene had been linked to higher risk of lung cancers in smokers. It was recommended to replace beta-carotene with lutein and zeaxanthin in future formulations for these reasons. * Three subsequent meta-analyses of dietary lutein and zeaxanthin concluded that these carotenoids lower the risk of progression from early stage AMD to late stage AMD. * A 2017 Cochrane review of 19 studies from several countries, however, concluded that dietary supplements containing zeaxanthin and lutein have little to no influence on the progression of AMD. In general, there remains insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of dietary or supplemental zeaxanthin or lutein in treatment or prevention of early AMD. ===Cataract research=== There is preliminary epidemiological evidence that increasing lutein and zeaxanthin intake lowers the risk of cataract development. Consumption of more than 2.4 mg of lutein/zeaxanthin daily from foods and supplements was significantly correlated with reduced incidence of nuclear lens opacities, as revealed from data collected during a 13- to 15-year period in one study. Two meta-analyses confirm a correlation between high diet content or high serum concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin and a decrease in the risk of cataract. There is only one published clinical intervention trial testing for an effect of lutein and zeaxanthin supplementation on cataracts. The AREDS2 trial enrolled subjects at risk for progression to advanced age-related macular degeneration. Overall, the group getting lutein (10 mg) and zeaxanthin (2 mg) were NOT less likely to progress to needing cataract surgery. The authors speculated that there may be a cataract prevention benefit for people with low dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin, but recommended more research. ==In diet== Lutein is a natural part of a human diet found in orange-yellow fruits and flowers, and in leafy vegetables. According to the NHANES 2013-2014 survey, adults in the United States consume on average 1.7 mg/day of lutein and zeaxanthin combined. NHANES 2013-2014 survey results, reported as What We Eat In America No recommended dietary allowance currently exists for lutein. Some positive health effects have been seen at dietary intake levels of 6‚Äì10 mg/day. The only definitive side effect of excess lutein consumption is bronzing of the skin (carotenodermia). As a food additive, lutein has the E number E161b (INS number 161b) and is extracted from the petals of African marigold (Tagetes erecta). WHO/FAO Codex Alimentarius General Standard for Food Additives It is approved for use in the EUUK Food Standards Agency: and Australia and New ZealandAustralia New Zealand Food Standards Code. In the United States lutein may not be used as a food coloring for foods intended for human consumption, but can be added to animal feed and is allowed as a human dietary supplement often in combination with Zeaxanthin. Example: lutein fed to chickens will show up in skin color and egg yolk color. Some foods contain relatively high amounts of lutein: USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 23 (2010) {  - ! Product ! Lutein/zeaxanthin (micrograms per 100 grams) -  nasturtium (yellow flowers, lutein levels only)  45,000 -  pot marigold (yellow and orange flowers, lutein levels only)  29,800 -  kale (raw)  39,550 -  kale (cooked)  18,246 -  dandelion leaves (raw)  13,610 -  nasturtium (leaves, lutein levels only)  13,600 -  turnip greens (raw)  12,825 -  spinach (raw)  12,198 -  spinach (cooked)  11,308 -  swiss chard (raw or cooked)  11,000 -  turnip greens (cooked)  8,440 -  collard greens (cooked)  7,694 -  watercress (raw)  5,767 -  garden peas (raw)  2,593 -  romaine lettuce  2,312 -  zucchini (courgettes)  2,125 -  brussels sprouts  1,590 -  broccoli, raw  1,403 -  pistachio nuts  1,205 -  broccoli, cooked  1,121 -  carrot (cooked)  687 -  maize/corn  642 -  egg (hard boiled)  353 -  avocado (raw)  271 -  carrot (raw)  256 -  kiwifruit  122 } ===Safety=== In humans, the Observed Safe Level (OSL) for lutein, based on a non-government organization evaluation, is 20 mg/day. Although much higher levels have been tested without adverse effects and may also be safe, the data for intakes above the OSL are not sufficient for a confident conclusion of long-term safety. Neither the U.S. Food and Drug Administration nor the European Food Safety Authority considers lutein an essential nutrient or has acted to set a tolerable upper intake level. ==Commercial value== The lutein market is segmented into pharmaceutical, dietary supplement, food, pet food, and animal and fish feed. The pharmaceutical market for lutein is estimated to be about US$190 million, and the nutraceutical and food categories are estimated to be about US$110 million. Pet food and other animal applications for lutein are estimated at US$175 million annually. This includes chickens (usually in combination with other carotenoids), to get color in egg yolks, and fish farms to color the flesh closer to wild-caught color. In the dietary supplement industry, the major market for lutein is for products with claims of helping maintain eye health. Newer applications are emerging in oral and topical products for skin health. Skin health via orally consumed supplements is one of the fastest growing areas of the US$2 billion carotenoid market.FOD025C The Global Market for Carotenoids, BCC Research ==See also== *Carotenoids *List of phytochemicals in food ==References Category:Carotenoids Category:Food antioxidants Category:Dietary antioxidants Category:Food colorings Category:Secondary alcohols Category:Cyclohexenes Category:E-number additives ","title":"Lutein"},{"id":"2232096","text":"Nigerian Communist Party was a communist party in Nigeria.

The area of present-day Poland went through the stages of socio-technical development known as the Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages after experiencing the climatic shifts of the glacial periods. The best known archeological discovery from the prehistoric period is the Lusatian-culture Biskupin fortified settlement. As ancient civilizations began to appear in southern and western Europe, the cultures of the area of present-day Poland were influenced by them to various degrees. Among the peoples that inhabited various parts of Poland up to the Iron Age stage of development were Scythian, Celtic, Germanic, Sarmatian, Roman, Avar, Vlach and Baltic tribes. In the Early Middle Ages, the area came to be dominated by West Slavic tribes and finally became home to a number of Lechitic Polish tribes that formed small states in the region beginning in the 8th century. == Historiography == As with other early periods areas of human history, knowledge of these times is limited, since few written ancient and medieval sources are available; research therefore relies primarily on archeology. Written language came to the Poles only after 966 AD, when the ruler of the Polish lands, Duke Mieszko I, converted to Christianity and educated foreign clerics arrived.Archeologia ≈ªywa (Living Archeology), special English issue 2005; a publication commissioned by the Centre for the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage in Warsaw. == Stone Age == Poland's Stone Age is divided into the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic eras. The Paleolithic era extended from c. 500,000 BC to 8,000 BC and is subdivided into four periods: the Lower Paleolithic, c. 500,000 to 350,000 BC; the Middle Paleolithic, c. 350,000 to 40,000 BC; the Upper Paleolithic, c. 40,000 to 10,000 BC; and the Final Paleolithic, c. 10,000 to 8000 BC. The Mesolithic era lasted from c. 8000 to 5500 BC and the Neolithic from c. 5500 to 2300 BC. The Neolithic is subdivided into the Neolithic proper, c. 5500 ‚Äì 2900 BC, and the Copper Age, c. 2900 ‚Äì 2300 BC. Poland's Stone Age lasted approximately 500,000 years and saw the appearance of three distinct Homo species: Homo erectus, Homo neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens (humans). The Stone Age cultures ranged from early human groups with primitive tools to advanced agricultural and stratified societies that used sophisticated stone tools, built fortified settlements and developed copper metallurgy. As elsewhere in Central Europe, the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic stages of Poland's Stone Age were each characterized by refinements in stone-tool-making techniques. Paleolithic human activities (whose earliest sites are 500,000 years old) were intermittent because of recurring glaciations. A general climate warming and a resulting increase in ecologic diversity were characteristic of the Mesolithic era (9000‚Äì8000 BC). The Neolithic era ushered in the first settled agricultural communities, whose founders had migrated from the Danube River area beginning about 5500 BC. Later, the native post-Mesolithic populations would also adopt and further develop the agricultural way of life (between 4400 and about 2000 BC).Various authors, ed. Marek Derwich and Adam ≈ªurek, U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski (do roku 1038) (Foundations of Poland (until year 1038)), Wydawnictwo Dolno≈õlƒÖskie, Wroc≈Çaw 2002, , pp. 8-53. == Bronze and Iron Ages == Poland's Bronze Age comprised Period I, c. 2300‚Äì1600 BC; Period II, c. 1600‚Äì1350 BC; Period III, c. 1350‚Äì1100 BC; Period IV, c. 1100‚Äì900 BC; and Period V, c. 900‚Äì700 BC. The Early Iron Age included Hallstatt Period C, c. 700‚Äì600 BC, and Hallstatt Period D, c. 600‚Äì450 BC. Reconstructed Biskupin Poland's Bronze- and Iron-Age cultures are known mainly from archeological research. Poland's Early Bronze Age cultures began around 2300-2400 BC,U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 55, S≈Çawomir Kadrow whereas the Iron Age commenced c. 700-750 BC.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 68, Bogus≈Çaw Gediga. By the beginning of the Common Era, the Iron Age archeological cultures described in the main article no longer existed. Given the absence of written records, the ethnicities and linguistic affiliations of the groups living in Central and Eastern Europe at that time are speculative; there is considerable disagreement about their identities. In Poland, the Lusatian culture, which spanned the Bronze and Iron Ages, became particularly prominent. The most famous archeological discovery from that period is the Biskupin fortified settlement (gr√≥d) that represented early-Iron-Age Lusatian culture.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, pp. 54-85. Bronze objects were brought to Poland around 2300 BC from the Carpathian Basin. The native Early Bronze Age that followed was dominated by the innovative Unetice culture in western Poland and the conservative Mierzanowice culture in eastern Poland. These were replaced in their respective territories for the duration of the subsequent Older Bronze Period by the (pre-Lusatian) Tumulus culture and the Trzciniec culture. Characteristic of the remaining bronze periods were the Urnfield cultures, in which skeletal burials were replaced by cremation throughout much of Europe. In Poland, the Lusatian culture settlements dominated the landscape for nearly a thousand years, continuing into the Early Iron Age. A series of Scythian invasions beginning in the 6th century BC, precipitated their demise. The Hallstatt Period D was a time of expansion for the Pomeranian culture, while the Western Baltic Kurgan culture dominated Poland's Masuria-Warmia region.Kalendarium dziej√≥w Polski (Chronology of Polish History), ed. Andrzej Chwalba, pp. 10-11, Jacek Poleski.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, pp. 54-83, S≈Çawomir Kadrow, Bogus≈Çaw Gediga. == Antiquity == The period of the La T√®ne culture is subdivided into La T√®ne A, c. 450‚Äì400 BC; La T√®ne B, c. 400‚Äì250 BC; La T√®ne C, c. 250‚Äì150 BC; and La T√®ne D, c. 150‚Äì0 BC. The period from 200 to 0 BC may also be considered a younger pre-Roman period. It was followed by a period of Roman influence whose early stage lasted from c. 0 to 150 AD and its later stage from c. 150 to 375 AD. The period from 375 to 500 AD constitutes the (pre-Slavic) Migration Period. Peoples belonging to numerous archeological cultures identified with Celtic, Germanic and Baltic tribes inhabited parts of Poland during the era of classical antiquity, from about 400 BC to 450-500 AD. Other groups, difficult to identify, were most likely also present, as the ethnic composition of archeological cultures is often poorly recognized. Short of using a written language to any appreciable degree, many of them developed a relatively advanced material culture and social organization, as evidenced by the archeological record, for example by richly furnished, dynastic \\"princely\\" graves. Characteristic of this period were high rates of migration, often involving large groups of people.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, pp. 86-121. Celtic peoples established settlements beginning in the early 4th century BC, mostly in southern Poland, the outer limit of their expansion, as representatives of the La T√®ne culture. With their developed economy and crafts, they exerted a lasting cultural influence disproportionate to their small numbers in the region.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, pp. 86-93. Germanic peoples lived in what is now Poland for several centuries, during which many of their tribes also migrated southward and eastward (see Wielbark culture). With the expansion of the Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes came under Roman cultural influence. Some written remarks by Roman authors that are relevant to developments on Polish lands have been preserved; they provide additional insights in conjunction with the archeological record. In the end, as the Roman Empire was nearing its collapse and the nomadic peoples invading from the east destroyed, damaged or destabilized the various Germanic cultures and societies, the Germanic peoples left Eastern and Central Europe for the safer and wealthier southern and western parts of the European continent.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, pp. 94-115. According to Tacitus and Ptolemy, the Goths left the lower Vistula region in the mid-2nd century AD. The northeast corner of what is now Poland remained populated by Baltic tribes. They were at the outer limits of any substantial cultural influence from the Roman Empire.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, pp. 116-119. ==See alsoReferencesFurther reading=== * Various authors, ed.

It is primarily used for soccer as the home field of Las Vegas Lights FC of the USL Championship. It was formerly the home of the Las Vegas 51s Minor League Baseball team of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. The field is adjacent to Cashman Center, an exhibit hall and theater operated by the City of Las Vegas. The complex is named for James \\"Big Jim\\" Cashman and his family, who have been Las Vegas entrepreneurs for several generations. ==Baseball beginnings== Former Cashman Field baseball configuration Cashman Field opened in 1983 as the home field of the new Las Vegas Stars, the former Spokane Indians of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League, who had relocated to Las Vegas following the 1982 season. The symmetrical field boasted dimensions of down the left and right field foul lines, feet to center field, and feet to the power alleys in right-center and left-center fields. The ballpark opened with a maximum seating capacity of 9,334. Its first professional baseball game was a Major League Baseball (MLB) exhibition held on April 1, 1983, in which the San Diego Padres faced the Seattle Mariners in front of 13,878 fans. The Cashman Field attendance record of 15,025 was set on April 3, 1993, for an exhibition game between the Chicago White Sox and Chicago Cubs. The ballpark played host the 1990 Triple-A All-Star Game which saw the team of National League-affiliated All-Stars defeat the team of American League-affiliated All-Stars, 8‚Äì5. Las Vegas' Eddie Williams was selected as the PCL MVP. In further interleague play, Cashman Field hosted the Triple-A World Series from 1998 until 2000. Its final professional baseball game was played on September 3, 2018. With the 51s trailing 3‚Äì2 in the bottom of the ninth inning and a runner on base, first baseman Peter Alonso hit a walk-off home run to left field giving Las Vegas a 4‚Äì3 win over the Sacramento River Cats. The 51s (renamed the Aviators) moved to Las Vegas Ballpark in Summerlin in 2019. ==Soccer== In July 2017, Las Vegas Lights FC, a team in the league then known as the United Soccer League and now as the USL Championship, was announced to begin playing at Cashman Field in 2018. Lights FC played their first game on February 10, 2018, an exhibition match against the Montreal Impact of Major League Soccer (MLS) in front of a crowd of 10,383 people. Cashman Field previously hosted MLS exhibition games between the LA Galaxy and San Jose Earthquakes, dubbed the California Clasico in 2016 and 2017. The original configuration of Cashman Field is more suited for soccer than other former baseball parks. With center field at a right angle and all the foul territory behind first and third base at equal distance, the field is in a square shape and seats are close to the field for soccer. The Lights began renovations to make Cashman Field a soccer-specific stadium in April 2019 after the Aviators baseball team formally gave their 60-day lease termination notice that made the Lights the primary tenant. ==Other eventsOther baseball events=== In addition to Triple-A baseball, the stadium hosted the Oakland Athletics' first 16 home games of the 1996 season due to renovations taking place at the Oakland‚ÄìAlameda County Coliseum. From 2001 to 2003, the field hosted the Big League Challenge, a home run derby for star Major Leaguers after the conclusion of the MLB season. Cashman Field hosted at least one Major League Baseball spring training game annually, dubbed Big League Weekend. The Cubs appeared in the game 13 consecutive times, with their final appearance in 2018. In 2017, the stadium hosted the Mexican Baseball Fiesta, a series of two games between the Naranjeros de Hermosillo and the √Åguilas de Mexicali of the Mexican Pacific League. Cashman Field had been suggested as a temporary stadium in the city's efforts to woo either a Major League Baseball expansion team, or an existing team desiring to move. The stadium would have served as home field until a permanent facility could be built. It had come up in the city's talks to lure the former Montreal Expos, Florida Marlins, and Oakland Athletics. However, the park would have needed considerable expansion, particularly in seating capacity, in order to host a team. The substantial costs which would be incurred in expansion and construction of a new stadium, as well as MLB concerns over Las Vegas' legalized gambling, have so far kept the city's proposals from achieving success. ===Football=== Though the original Cashman Field hosted several American football teams in the 1960s (including the UNLV Rebels football team, the Las Vegas Cowboys of the Continental Football League in 1969 and at least one American Football League exhibition), it ceased doing so around 1971 with the opening of Sam Boyd Stadium, which was designed for football. In 1964, the field was re-organized for an AFL charity game where the Oakland Raiders had played the Houston Oilers, in a game that the Raiders won 53 to 49.https://news3lv.com/features/video-vault/video-vault-the-first-time-the- raiders-came-to-las-vegas The stadium was also considered for use as the home stadium for the Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League starting in 2011; however, the team remained at Sam Boyd Stadium in Whitney for that season's only home game. The team again announced negotiations with Cashman for the 2012 season but decided again to remain at Sam Boyd for at least the first two games of the season. The league ceased operations before the season's other two home games, which Sam Boyd had not yet agreed to host, could take place. ===Concerts=== Several concerts were held at the field such as Jerry Cantrell and Metallica on September 12, 1998. Other concerts have included The Beach Boys, Earth, Wind & Fire and The Doobie Brothers == Problems and criticism == During the last years of the 51s' stay at Cashman Field, players and staff from both the 51s and visiting teams criticized the facility. While it had been state-of-the-art when it opened, by the turn of the millennium it was considered far behind the times. Players complained that the field was hard on their backs and knees. The bullpens and clubhouse were also considered second-class. The weight room was smaller when compared to other Triple-A stadiums, with infielder Ty Kelly calling it \\"basically just a room... not an actual weight room\\". The batting cage was also a point of concern for the players. It was a single lane, which was only accessible by walking out of the clubhouse to the parking lot. Johnny Monell described the cage as one likely to be found at a high school facility and not up to par for a Triple-A stadium. During a 51s game on August 22, 2015, the stadium sewage system backed up, causing raw sewage to flow into the dugouts. The smell was so strong that players were forced to watch the rest of the game from chairs on the field. Team president and chief operating officer Don Logan said, \\"It's disappointing that Vegas has the worst facility in our league when we have such a great town with the greatest hotels, the greatest dining, the greatest shopping. It's not becoming of this community to have a place like this.\\" Pacific Coast League commissioner Branch Barrett Rickey expressed his concerns about the feasibility of the continuous usage of Cashman Field as a Triple-A ballpark. In a letter to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority which owned and operated the facility, he wrote that ensuring that the upgrades necessary to keep Cashman at something approaching Triple-A standards would require spending \\"many tens of millions of dollars\\" that would still not be enough to make the stadium \\"an optimal long-term solution.\\" He also added that Cashman's days of useful life were \\"well behind it,\\" and that most MLB teams opted to place their top affiliations in \\"far less appropriate markets\\" than Las Vegas rather than deal with Cashman's shortcomings. In 2019, Cashman was replaced as a baseball park by Las Vegas Ballpark in Summerlin. ==Redevelopment and the future of Cashman Field== In 2017, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, which had been the primary operators of Cashman Center and Cashman Field, turned over all operations to the City of Las Vegas. Since that time, the city has attempted to redevelop and revitalize the site, even soliciting ideas from the public. In 2018, the site was considered for a proposed stadium for the National Football League's Oakland Raiders during the team's relocation bid, however it was beat out by a larger site closer to the Las Vegas Strip. The city, so far, has been unsuccessful in its attempt to redevelop the site, with the convention halls and theater remaining closed, and only Cashman Field hosting events. On June 5, 2019, the Las Vegas City Council voted to begin negotiations with the Renaissance Group to redevelop the Cashman Center and adjacent land also owned by the city to feature a new 25,000-seat soccer stadium as well as retail, hotels and residences. If an agreement is reached within the 180 day time limit (expiring on December 3, 2019), Lights FC owner Brett Lashbrook has agreed to sell the team to Boston-based Baupost Group in effort to make the Lights a Major League Soccer expansion franchise. Under the Renaissance Group's proposal, Cashman Field's current playing field would remain as a practice field for the Lights FC. ==Original Cashman Field== The original Cashman Field was built in 1947 on a site at Las Vegas Boulevard and Bonanza Avenue. The stadium was used for football and rodeos before the first baseball game was held on May 21, 1948. The stadium was designed primarily for football, rodeo, concerts and boxing with one large grandstand. For baseball this meant all the seats were along first base line. The stadium was home to the Las Vegas Wranglers from 1947 to 1952 and again from 1957 to 1958. Boxing matches were also held at the facility. The first professional football game in Las Vegas was held at the stadium in 1964 when the American Football League then-Oakland Raiders played the then-Houston Oilers. ==See also== * Sports in the Las Vegas metropolitan area ==References * Las Vegas Lights FC: Cashman Field * Ballpark Digest visit to Cashman Field Category:Las Vegas 51s Category:Las Vegas Lights FC Category:Oakland Athletics Category:Defunct minor league baseball venues Category:Defunct baseball venues in the United States Category:Boxing venues in Las Vegas Category:Music venues in the Las Vegas Valley Category:Oakland Athletics stadiums Category:Sports venues in Las Vegas Category:Soccer venues in Nevada Category:USL Championship stadiums Category:1983 establishments in Nevada Category:Sports venues completed in 1983 ","title":"Cashman Field"},{"id":"2232158","text":"Muirkirk Football Club are a Scottish football club, based in the village of Muirkirk, East Ayrshire.

It is the home field of the Salt Lake Bees of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League and the collegiate Utah Utes of the Pac-12 Conference. Smith's Ballpark opened in 1994 with a seating capacity of 15,400, the largest in the PCL. It is located on the site of its predecessor, Derks Field, with a similar unorthodox southeast alignment, toward the Wasatch Range. The elevation at street level is above sea level. ==History== In its inaugural season in 1994, the Buzz set a PCL attendance record with 713,224 fans. The team led the PCL in attendance in each of its first six seasons in Salt Lake. The largest crowd at the ballpark is 16,531 in 2000; the Saturday night opponent was the Albuquerque Dukes on July 22. Besides hosting the Salt Lake Bees, Smith's Ballpark has played host to two exhibition games featuring the Minnesota Twins, a spring training game featuring the Seattle Mariners and the Colorado Rockies, concerts, soccer matches, and high school and college baseball games, including a Mountain West Conference tournament. The ballpark has hosted the Triple-A All-Star Game twice. In 1996, a team of National League-affiliated All-Stars defeated their American League opponents, 2‚Äì1. Salt Lake's Todd Walker was selected as the PCL MVP. The game returned to the park in 2011 with the International League All-Stars beating the PCL team, 3‚Äì0. After Franklin Covey's 15-year naming rights agreements expired in 2009, an agreement with Spring Mobile, an AT&T; Mobility authorized retailer, made the ballpark's name Spring Mobile Ballpark for five seasons. In March 2014, it was announced that Salt Lake City-based Smith's Food and Drug had signed a six-year naming rights deal, giving the park its current name. ==Features== Smith's Ballpark has one of the biggest upper decks in the minor leagues, which are uncommon outside of the majors. The ballpark also contains 24 luxury suites on the third level along with two private party patios. Smith's Ballpark is noted for its stunning views of the Wasatch Mountains over the left and center field walls. The stadium is located one block east of Ballpark station on the TRAX light rail system. ==Naming rights== When the ballpark opened in 1994, it was called Franklin Quest Field, which the Franklin Quest Company paid $1.4 million for 15 years for the naming rights in the summer of 1993. It changed its name to Franklin Covey Field in 1997 after Franklin Quest merged with the Covey Leadership Center, becoming Franklin Covey. In 2009, the Bees announced on April 7 that they had reached a multi-year naming-rights deal with Spring Mobile (a Salt Lake City-based AT&T; authorized retailer) to provide the ballpark's new name of Spring Mobile Ballpark which ran for five seasons. In 2014, Smith's Food and Drug signed a six-year agreement to rename it Smith's Ballpark. ==See also== * List of NCAA Division I baseball venues * List of Pacific Coast League stadiums ==References * Smith's Ballpark Category:College baseball venues in the United States Category:Utah Utes baseball Category:Minor league baseball venues Category:Sports venues in Salt Lake City Category:Baseball venues in Utah Category:Sports venues completed in 1994 Category:1994 establishments in Utah Category:Populous buildings ","title":"Smith's Ballpark"},{"id":"2232165","text":"Final V.U. 1971‚Äì1973 is a box set by the Velvet Underground, comprising live recordings from after founding members Lou Reed and Sterling Morrison had left the group. It was released by Japanese record company Captain Trip Records in August 2001. ==About the album== After singer, guitarist and main songwriter Lou Reed quit the Velvet Underground in August 1970, the band carried on: Doug Yule assumed leadership and moved to lead vocals and guitar, and Walter Powers joined to play bass guitar. This version of the Velvet Underground, which still featured original member Sterling Morrison and longtime drummer Maureen Tucker, played around 30 dates to promote the band's fourth album, Loaded (1970). Almost a year after Reed's departure, Morrison also left the band; he was replaced by Boston-based keyboardist Willie Alexander. The band now contained no founding members (although Tucker had been a member since before the recording of the Velvets' debut album). They then went to tour the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, still in support of Loaded, which had had a March 1971 release date in Europe. Two dates of this tour, November 5, 1971 in London and November 19 in Amsterdam, were recorded by members of the audience, and appear as discs one and two of this set, respectively. The Amsterdam concert was also recorded from the soundboard by Dutch radio station VPRO and subsequently broadcast on FM radio. A few tracks from this broadcast were recorded by a fan and appear as tracks 11‚Äì14 on disc four of this set. Once the European tour was completed, initial plans were for the Yule‚ÄìAlexander‚ÄìPowers‚ÄìTucker line-up to record a new studio album in England. However, band manager Steve Sesnick sent Alexander, Powers and Tucker back to America, and Yule recorded Squeeze backed by session musicians. Sesnick then assembled a backing band around Yule to once again tour the United Kingdom in support of Squeeze. Shortly before the tour started, however, Sesnick quit as the Velvets' manager. Yule and the band struggled through the dates, then called it quits. One date of this tour, December 6, 1972, at St David's College, Lampeter, was recorded by an audience member and appears as disc three of this set. In the spring of 1973 at the urging of a tour manager, Yule and some friends toured New England with a new group, which included some Velvet Underground material in their set lists. The tour manager insisted on billing the band as being the Velvet Underground despite demands from Yule not to do so. Yule fired the manager after three dates and the tour dissolved shortly thereafter. One date from this tour, May 27, 1973 in Boston, was recorded by an audience member and appears as disc four of this set.

The club currently play in the . Nicknamed The Vics, the club were formed in 1944 and currently play at Dam Park Stadium, near Ayr town centre. The club were forced to leave their traditional home of Voluntary Park in Whitletts, which doubled up as a greyhound racing track, in February 2011, after actions by the leaseholder raised major health and safety concerns, forcing the local council to close the stadium. The stadium has since been demolished and is now the site of a new social housing complex called Victoria Crescent, after the club. ==History== On the park, the greatest era in the club's history was the mid- to late 1950s. In 1956 the club played in front of 20,100 people at Shawfield Stadium in the semi final of the Scottish Junior Cup, only to lose 3‚Äì2 to eventual winners Petershill. However, in 1957-58 the Club won the Western League (South) Championship, losing out to North Champions Irvine Meadow in the play-off to determine the destination of the league championship itself. Since then the club has had, in the main, a troubled time, with its very existence called into question on a number of occasions. However, in recent years, developments on and off the park have placed the club on a more secure foundation. In 2017‚Äì18 the Club won promotion to the newly formed West Region Championship and in 2018 formed its own charity, Vics in the Community, providing free coaching to local youngsters and starting the development of a youth player pathway. In 2020, the club took the decision after 75 years of membership of the SJFA, to join the pyramid system in Scottish football as one of the inaugural members of the West of Scotland Football League. On 10 October 2020, the club announced they would not be participating in the inaugural season of the West of Scotland League due to concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. == Current Squad == {  +Whitletts Victoria FC Squad 2019-20 !No. !Pos. !Name ! !No. !Pos. !Name - 1 GK Scott Johnson  11 FW Robert Patterson - 2 DF Martin Findlay  12 MF Callum Ogston - 3 DF Paul Millar  13 GK Daniel McColgan - 4 DF Isaac Kerr  14 FW Jordan Baird - 5 DF Calum Walsh  15 MF Sean Ewart - 6 MF The Undertaker  16 MF Stewart Davidson - 7 MF Louis Kerr  8 MF Marc Dyer - 8 MF Jordan Boyd  18 MF  - 9 FW Michael Reilly  19 DF Morgan Brown - 10 FW Thomas Donovan  20 FW  } ==Non-playing staffCommittee=== {  - !

They were the only 2-8-2Ts built and used by a British railway, and the largest tank engines to run on the Great Western Railway. ==Rebuild and operation== Originally the 4200 class and 5205 class 2-8-0T were introduced for short-haul Welsh coal traffic, but the Stock Market Crash of 1929 saw coal traffic dramatically fall. Built specifically for the short runs of heavy trains in the South Wales Coalfield, Charles Collett took the agreed decision to rebuild some of them with an extended coal carrying capacity and thus greater range and usefulness by adding to the frames, requiring the addition of a trailing wheel set, making them 2-8-2T. With the work carried out at Swindon Works, the first to be converted was 5275 (lot 266), which returned to traffic numbered 7200 in August 1934. An official photograph of the prototype was taken on 27 July 1934 at the usual site outside 'A Shop' for engine pictures. Nos. 5276‚Äì94 were similarly rebuilt between August and November 1934, becoming 7201‚Äì19, and nos. 7220‚Äì39 were rebuilt from 5255‚Äì74 between August 1935 and February 1936; with both batches, the rebuilding was not in numerical order, but the new numbers were in the same sequence as the old.

These bunkers consisted of a higher rivet line increasing the water capacity up to a total of 2,700 gallons allowing the locos to travel longer distances. The bunker was also designed to facilitate the movement of the coal towards the hatch in the cab, however ‚Äòscuttle bunkers‚Äô would only carry 5 tonnes of coal instead of 6. No.7200 is the only surviving loco of the class to carry one of these unique bunkers. The 54 rebuilt locos found work in most parts of the GWR system, where their great weight was allowed, although the rebuilt chassis length did get them banned from certain goods yards. Many found work in the home counties, deployed on iron ore and stone trains from Banbury. On 17 May 1941 no. 7238 ran into a bomb crater. == Withdrawal == The first member of the class to be withdrawn was number 7241 in November 1962, whilst the last four engines in traffic served until June 1965. Four of the class were bought by Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, and no. 7226 was scrapped there in 1965.

On 12 December 2006, the restored rolling chassis of 7200 left the former iron foundry (J Shop) which made the loco the last Great Western locomotive to receive attention at the historic Swindon Works.

Their greatest hit is \\"Blueprint\\". ==History== The band formed in 1986 and named themselves after an instrumental track by Tom Waits. When they won the Rock competition of the Senate of Berlin, they were contracted by Mercury Records. Their first album Rainbirds was produced in the Audio Studios of Berlin and became a success, the single \\"Blueprint\\" enjoyed attention across Europe in 1988. The band's first line-up included Katharina Franck (guitar, vocals), Michael Beckmann (bass), and Wolfgang Glum (drums). Due to a concert tour, guitarist Rodrigo Gonz√°lez became a member of the Rainbirds. Later he joined Die √Ñrzte and Abw√§rts. In the spring of 1989, the second album Call Me Easy, Say I‚Äôm Strong, Love Me My Way, It Ain‚Äôt Wrong was released, with a video clip by director and photographer Anton Corbijn. Corbijn who was known for his photographs of bands like Depeche Mode and U2 became the Rainbird's favourite photographer in the following years. After this album, the band separated and Katharina Franck reformed the Rainbirds as a duo with piano player Ulrike Haage. They released two albums in this line- up: Two Faces (1991) and In a Different Light (1993). Drummer Tim Lorenz joined them in 1994 as a third member. In the following years the band published two studio albums: Making Memory (1996) and Forever (1997), as well as a live album rainbirds3000.live (1999), their last release. ===Solo careers=== Katharina Franck continued a solo career that had already begun in 1997 with a spoken word album Hunger and published a second solo album Zeitlupenkino (lit.: slow motion cinema) on Mute Records in 2002. Also Ulrike Haage, after recording numerous audio plays and composing theatre music, presented a solo album S√©lavy in 2004. Drummer Tim Lorenz operates a recording studio in Berlin. ===Reformation=== In 2013, the Rainbirds reformed with a new line-up. Prior to the re-release of their remastered debut album Rainbirds, it was announced in September 2013 that a new album has been recorded with Katharina Franck as singer, drummer Bela Brauckmann and electronic musician Gunter Papperitz. Their new album Yonder was released in May 2014. ==Discography Albums === {  - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Title ! colspan=\\"3\\"  Peak positions - ! width=\\"30\\"AUT ! width=\\"30\\"GER ! width=\\"30\\"SWI -  1987  Rainbirds  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" 2  align=\\"center\\" 21 - -  1989  Call Me Easy, Say I‚Äôm Strong, Love Me My Way, It Ain‚Äôt Wrong  align=\\"center\\" 28  align=\\"center\\" 4  align=\\"center\\" 18 -  1991  Two Faces  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì -  1993  In a Different Light  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" 89  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì -  1995  The Mercury Years  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì -  1996  Making Memory  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì -  1997  Forever  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì -  1999  rainbirds3000.live  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì -  2014  Yonder  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì - } === Singles === {  - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Title ! colspan=\\"3\\"  Peak positions ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Album - ! width=\\"30\\"AUT ! width=\\"30\\"GER ! width=\\"30\\"SWI -  1987  \\"Blueprint\\"  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" 7  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  Rainbirds -  1988  \\"Boy on the Beach\\"  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" 57  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  Rainbirds -  rowspan=\\"3\\" 1989  \\"Sea of Time\\"  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" 39  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  rowspan=\\"3\\" Call Me Easy, Say I‚Äôm Strong, Love Me My Way, It Ain‚Äôt Wrong -  \\"Not Exactly\\"  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" 58  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì -  \\"Love Is a Better Word (White City of Light)\\"  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì -  1991  \\"Two Faces\\"  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  Two Faces -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 1993  \\"Devil's Dance\\"  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  rowspan=\\"2\\" In a Different Light -  \\"Jamais Jamais\\"  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì -  1995  \\"Blueprint\\" (new mix)  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì The Mercury Years -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 1996  \\"Absolutely Free\\"  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  rowspan=\\"2\\"Making Memory -  \\"Give Me a Kiss\\"  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 1997  \\"Don‚Äôt Cry a River for Me (Be Cool)\\"  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  rowspan=\\"2\\"Forever -  \\"Shoot from the Hip\\"  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì - } ==References External links == *www.rainbirds.com Official Site * * Category:German musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1986 Category:1986 establishments in Germany ","title":"Rainbirds"},{"id":"2232175","text":"Luke Joseph Scarpa (October 4, 1928 ‚Äì April 3, 2012) was an American professional wrestler who was best known by the ring name Chief Jay Strongbow. He portrayed a Native American wrestler, who wore a war bonnet to the ring and would \\"go on the warpath\\" when the fans started cheering him against an opponent. In reality, he was a business-minded Italian-American. ==Professional wrestling career== Strongbow's wrestling attire ===National Wrestling Alliance (1947‚Äì1970)=== Scarpa's wrestling career began in 1947, under his real name. He was a standout in the Georgia and Florida territories of the National Wrestling Alliance throughout the 1950s and 1960s, winning several championships and becoming a fan favorite. ===World Wide Wrestling Federation (1970‚Äì1979)=== In 1970, Scarpa began working for Vincent J. McMahon's World Wide Wrestling Federation as Chief Jay Strongbow, a Native American gimmick complete with a traditional headdress and Native themed wrestling moves.Slotnik, Daniel E. Joe Scarpa, Who Gained Wrestling Fame as Chief Jay Strongbow, Dies The New York Times (April 5, 2012). Retrieved July 7, 2013. He feuded with the likes of \\"The Golden Greek\\" Spiros Arion, \\"Handsome Jimmy\\" Valiant, and Superstar Billy Graham, nearly winning the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship. A memorable match against \\"Iron Mike\\" McCord featured Strongbow applying his sleeper hold. But Lou Albano, McCord's manager, interfered by smashing a cast on the Chief's forehead. It was alleged that Strongbow had previously jumped Albano in the locker room, breaking his arm. McCord was disqualified, but Strongbow was cut wide open by Albano's blows. Strongbow settled the score in front of a sold out crowd at Madison Square Garden, beating Captain Lou Albano convincingly. Strongbow picked up a win at Madison Square Garden in the summer of 1970, shortly after he entered the WWWF, pinning top contender Crusher Verdue, who was managed by Lou Albano. In 1975, he began feuding with Spiros Arion. Arion, a popular and seemingly unbeatable babyface, returned to the WWWF after an absence and teamed with Strongbow. Arion turned on Strongbow, destroying his headdress on Philadelphia television after he had tied Strongbow in the ropes, and rubbed the feathers in his face. Arion was now a heel, and pinned Strongbow in eastern arenas as he went on to challenge champion Bruno Sammartino. Strongbow won his first WWWF World Tag Team Championship on May 22, 1972 with partner Sonny King. They defeated the team of Baron Mikel Scicluna and King Curtis Iaukea. Strongbow and King held the title for a month before losing it to the team of Mr. Fuji and Professor Toru Tanaka on June 27. Four and a half years later, on December 7, 1976, Strongbow won his second WWWF World Tag Team Championship, this time with partner Billy White Wolf. The team won the title in a three-team tournament, defeating The Executioners and Nikolai Volkoff and Tor Kamata. Their reign was cut short in August 1977 when the belts were vacated due to White Wolf suffering a neck injury at the hands of Ken Patera's Swinging Full Nelson. In 1979, he feuded with Greg \\"The Hammer\\" Valentine, who broke Strongbow's leg. The two wrestled all over the WWF circuit, including an \\"Indian Strap match\\" at Madison Square Garden on July 30, 1979. ===NWA Detroit / Big Time Wrestling (1976)=== Strongbow also competed for The Sheik's Big Time Wrestling promotion in Detroit. He had a memorable feud with \\"Bulldog\\" Don Kent, which culminated in a \\"shark cage match\\" in 1976. Strongbow and Kent fought inside of a small shark cage, with the first man to escape being declared the winner. With an assist from fellow fan favorite Mark Lewin, Strongbow was able to escape the shark cage victorious. ===NWA Georgia / Mid- Atlantic and other territories (1980-1981)=== After wrestling in the WWF for 9 years, Strongbow went to work for Georgia Championship Wrestling and Mid- Atlantic Championship Wrestling. In Detroit he feuded with Don Kent once again. Then he feuded with Baron Von Raschke in Georgia. He won the WWC Caribbean Heavyweight Championship defeating Luke Graham on October 11, 1980 in Puerto Rico. Then dropped the title on December 20 to Danny Condrey. In 1981 he went to Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling where he feuded with Kevin Sullivan. ===Return to WWF (1982‚Äì1986)=== In 1982, Strongbow formed a tag team with his on-screen brother, Jules Strongbow. On June 28, the Strongbows won the tag team championship from the team of Mr. Fuji and Mr. Saito in New York City's Madison Square Garden. During the match, special guest referee Ivan Putski counted the winning fall, but did not see Fuji's foot draped over the bottom rope. On the July 13 episode of Championship Wrestling, the Strongbows lost the titles back to Fuji and Saito, but on the October 26 episode of Championship Wrestling, the Strongbows defeated Fuji and Saito for their second WWF Tag Team Championship reign as a team. On the March 8, 1983 episode of Championship Wrestling, the Strongbows lost the titles to The Wild Samoans (Afa and Sika). After failing in regaining the belts, the Strongbows disbanded. ===Retirement (1986‚Äì1994, 2008)=== Strongbow retired in 1986, but would still step back into the ring from time to time, most notably for a legends battle royal in East Rutherford, New Jersey in 1987. In retirement, Strongbow became a WWF road agent and worked in the company's front office. He also participated in a 1994 storyline in which he mentored Tatanka (an actual Native American of the Lumbee tribe). Strongbow was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame class of 1994 by Gorilla Monsoon. Strongbow's last appearance in WWE was a brief appearance on the November 17, 2008 episode of Monday Night Raw when Stephanie McMahon introduced him to the audience in Atlanta. ==Personal life== Strongbow in 2011 His son, Joe Jr. wrestled in the 1980s and early 1990s mainly as Mark Pyle and Mark Young in the WWF from 1986-1990 and Vince Young in WCW. Joe Jr. died in 2016 at the age of 48. He also has a daughter Connie Pacheco of Portland, Oregon. ==Death== Scarpa fell at his home in late 2011 and was hospitalized. He died in that hospital on April 3, 2012, at the age of 83. He was buried in Griffin, Georgia. ==Championships and accomplishments== *Championship Wrestling from Florida **NWA Brass Knuckles Championship (Florida version) (2 times) **NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **NWA Southern Tag Team Championship (Florida version) (3 times) - with Jose Lothario **NWA World Tag Team Championship (Florida version) (1 time) - with Don Curtis *Gulf Coast Championship Wrestling **NWA Gulf Coast Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **NWA Southern Tag Team Championship (Gulf Coast version) (2 times) - with Lee Fields *NWA Mid-America **NWA Mid-America World Tag Team Championship (3 times) - with Lester Welch (2) and Alex Perez (1) **NWA Tri-State Heavyweight Championship (Alabama version) (1 time) *Mid-South Sports **NWA Georgia Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **NWA Macon Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with El Mongol **NWA World Tag Team Championship (Georgia version) (1 time) - with Don Curtis *New England Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame **Class of 2011 *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **PWI Most Popular Wrestler of the Year (1973) **PWI Most Inspirational Wrestler of the Year (1979) **PWI ranked him # 214 of the 500 best singles wrestlers during the \\"PWI Years\\" in 2003. *Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum **(Class of 2009) *World Wrestling Council **WWC Caribbean Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *World Wide Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Federation **WWWF / WWF Tag Team Championship (4 times) - with Sonny King (1), Billy White Wolf (1), and Jules Strongbow (2) **WWF Hall of Fame (Class of 1994) *Wrestling Observer Newsletter :*Most Washed Up Wrestler (1983) ==References* Category:1928 births Category:2012 deaths Category:American male professional wrestlers Category:American people of Italian descent Category:Professional wrestlers from New Jersey Category:Professional wrestling executives Category:Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum Category:WWE Hall of Fame inductees Category:Sportspeople from Philadelphia Category:Deaths from falls ","title":"Chief Jay Strongbow"},{"id":"2232176","text":"Harbor Park is a stadium, used primarily for baseball, on the Elizabeth River, in downtown Norfolk, Virginia. Once rated the best minor league stadium by Baseball America, it is home to the Norfolk Tides Minor League Baseball team. The Tides are the Baltimore Orioles' Triple-A farm team and compete in the South division of the International League. Harbor Park opened on April 14, 1993, and can seat 11,856 people. ==Features== Seating includes 9,000 lower deck seats, 2,800 upper deck seats and a 300-person capacity picnic area. The stadium also features 24 luxury skyboxes with seating for 400, and a 225-seat full-service restaurant with a panoramic view of the field from the first base side. A record crowd of 14,263 was reached August 31, 1996. The field is made of natural grass and features a state of the art irrigation and drainage system. The outfield dimensions are 333 feet to the left field foul pole, 400 feet to straightaway center, and 318 down the right field line. Throughout the 1990s, the stadium served as the home field for some of Norfolk's high school football games, primarily Maury, Granby, and Booker T. Washington. In 1996, BTW opened a new stadium on the school campus; in 2005, Maury and Granby moved to a new facility, Powhatan Field. In the past, the stadium also hosted high school football postseason games, although that has not happened since 2012. ==Transportation== The Tide light rail has a station along Park Avenue, adjacent to Harbor Park stadium. Amtrak also has its Norfolk station adjacent to the stadium. ==Notable events== Harbor Park hosted the 1998 Triple-A All- Star Game in which the International League All-Stars defeated the Pacific Coast League All-Stars, 8‚Äì4. During Major League Baseball's search for a new home for the Montreal Expos, Norfolk submitted a proposal which would have expanded Harbor Park to temporarily accommodate a major league team. Norfolk's bid was rejected and the Expos eventually became the Washington Nationals. On March 30, 2007, the Washington Nationals played an exhibition game against the Baltimore Orioles at Harbor Park. The game was sold out two weeks in advance; attendance was 12,408. The Orioles and Nationals played another exhibition game in 2009; the Orioles and Tides also play each other in occasional exhibition games, having done so in 2012, 2014, and 2018. On October 28, 2008, Barack Obama held a rally at Harbor Park. On December 16, 2008, the city of Norfolk approved a plan by the Tides to build a party deck in right field, behind the home team's bullpen. Completed in March 2009, two weeks before an Orioles‚ÄìNationals exhibition game, the deck holds 400 people but did not increase stadium capacity, except during sold-out games, when the deck accommodates some overflow. The right field fence was moved in 20 feet, to accommodate the deck, setting it at its current distance of 318 feet. The concert band piece Harbor Park Holiday, written in 1996 by Norfolk native James L. Hosay, was written about Harbor Park. On August 30, 2019, Harbor Park hosted the RIP Paul Walker fantasy football draft party. Actor Leslie David Baker of the hit television show The Office was in attendance as well. ==References *City of Norfolk's Seven Venues Official site *Harbor Park Views - Ball Parks of the Minor Leagues *The Norfolk Tides *Ballpark Reviews Pictures * Harbor Park at worldstadiums.com * Seating chart * Hurricane Isabel Category:Minor league baseball venues Category:Sports venues in Norfolk, Virginia Category:Baseball venues in Virginia Category:Sports venues completed in 1993 Category:1993 establishments in Virginia Category:Downtown Norfolk, Virginia Category:Populous buildings ","title":"Harbor Park"},{"id":"2232181","text":"A psychological adaptation seen universally in humans is to easily learn a fear of snakes. A psychological adaptation is a functional, cognitive or behavioral trait that benefits an organism in its environment. Psychological adaptations fall under the scope of evolved psychological mechanisms (EPMs), however, EPMs refer to a less restricted set. Psychological adaptations include only the functional traits that increase the fitness of an organism, while EPMs refer to any psychological mechanism that developed through the processes of evolution. These additional EPMs are the by-product traits of a species‚Äô evolutionary development (see spandrels), as well as the vestigial traits that no longer benefit the species‚Äô fitness. It can be difficult to tell whether a trait is vestigial or not, so some literature is more lenient and refers to vestigial traits as adaptations, even though they may no longer have adaptive functionality. For example, xenophobic attitudes and behaviors appear to have certain EPM influences relating to disease aversion, however, in certain environments these behaviors may actually have a poor effect on a person's fitness. The principles of psychological adaptation rely on Darwin's theory of evolution and are important to the fields of evolutionary psychology, biology, and cognitive science. == Darwinian theory == Charles Darwin Charles Darwin proposed his theory of evolution in On the Origin of Species (1859). His theory dictates that adaptations are traits that arise from the selective pressures a species faces in its environment. Adaptations must benefit either an organism's chance of survival or reproduction to be considered adaptive, and are then passed down to the next generation through this process of natural selection. Psychological adaptions are those adaptive traits that we consider cognitive or behavioral. These can include conscious social strategies, subconscious emotional responses (guilt, fear, etc.), or the most innate instincts. Evolutionary psychologists consider a number of factors in what determines a psychological adaptation, such as functionality, complexity, efficiency, and universality. The Adapted Mind is considered a foundational text on evolutionary psychology, further integrating Darwinian theory into modern psychology. ==Evolved adaptation vs learned behaviour== An area of disagreement arises between evolutionary psychologists, cognitive scientists and behaviourists on where to draw the line on what is considered a psychological adaptation, and what is considered a learned behaviour.Buss, D.M. (2004) Evolutionary psychology: The new science of the mind. Evolutionary Psychology 3rd Ed. Boston. Where behaviourism explains certain behaviours as conditioned responses, cognitivism may push that these behaviours arise from a psychological adaptation that institutes a preference for that behaviour. Evolutionary psychology proposes that the human psychology consists primarily of psychological adaptations, which is opposed by the tabula rasa or blank slate model of human psychology. Early behaviourists, like B.F. Skinner, tended to the blank slate model and argued that innate behaviors and instincts were few, some behaviourists suggesting that the only innate behavior was the ability to learn. On the other hand, Steven Pinker presents the cognitivist perspective in his book, The Blank Slate, in which he challenges the tabula rasa models and argues that human behaviour is shaped by psychological adaptations.Pinker, Steven. (2002) The blank slate: The modern denial of human nature. Allen Lane, London. Print This difference in theory can be seen in research on modern human sexual preferences, with behaviourists arguing that attraction has conditioning influences, such as from the media or cultural norms, while others arguing it is based on psychological adaptations. However, sexual preferences are a difficult subject to test due to the amount of variance and flexibility exhibited in human mate choice.Miller, G.F. (1997) Mate choice: From sexual cues to cognitive adaptations. Ciba Foundation Symposium, 208:71-87. A hybrid resolution to psychological adaptations and learned behaviours refers to an adaptation as the species‚Äô capacity for a certain behavior, while each individual organism still needs to be conditioned to exhibit that behaviour. This approach can explain language acquisition in relation to linguist and cognitive scientist Noam Chomsky's model of human language.Lenneberg, E. H., Chomsky, N., & Marx, O. (1967). Biological foundations of language (Vol. 68). New York: Wiley. http://tocs.ulb.tu- darmstadt.de/123135893.pdf His model supports that the capacity for language is a psychological adaptation (involving both the language necessary brain structures and disposition for language acquisition), however, children lack any particular instantiation of language at birth, and must instead learn one in their environment. == Sexual selection == The mating strategies of both sexes can be simplified into different psychological adaptations. There is extensive evidence that incest avoidance, which is the tendency to avoid sexual intercourse with close relatives is an evolved behavioural adaptation. Incest avoidance can be seen cross-culturally in humans, and is evident in wild animals. Evolutionary psychologists argue that incest avoidance adapted due to the greater chance of producing children with severe disabilities when mating with relatives, and because genetic variability offers an increase in fitness regarding offspring survival. Sexual jealousy is another behavior observed in human and non-human animals that appears to be instinctual. Heuristic problem solving and consistent preference for behavioral patterns are considered by some evolutionary psychologists to be psychological adaptations.Buss, D.M., Kruger, D., Kurzban, R. et al. (2009) Evolutionary theory and psychology. Psychological Science Agenda, Science Briefs. http://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/05/sci-brief.aspx#Machery For example, the tendency for females to change their sexual strategies when faced with developmental pressures such as an absent father may be the result of a psychological adaptation. == Psychological adaptation in males == Human males have developed psychological adaptations, which make them attractive to the opposite sex in order to increase their reproductive success. Evolutionarily, it pays for a male to be polygynous ‚Äì to have a number of female partners at once ‚Äì because it means he can create more offspring at once, as they don't have to invest any time in carrying a foetus. Examples of some of these other adaptations include strategies to entice females, strategies to retain a partner and the desire for short-term relationships. Women find humorous men more attractive. === Humour === It has been researched that humour is sexually selected and acts as a fitness indicator.Greengross, G. (2014). Male production of humour produced by sexually selected psychological adaptations. In Shackelford, V. A & Shackelford, T. K. (2014). Evolutionary perspectives on human sexual psychology and behaviour(173-196). New York:Springer. The production of humour increases mate value in men, and so women seek males with a good sense of humour. In turn, males have developed an adaptation in which they produce humour to attract women. Historically, men fight with each other as a mate retention strategy. === Waist-to-hip ratio === Human males have developed an adaptation in which they find women more attractive if they show cues of fertility, such as a good waist‚Äìhip ratio. Women with a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.7 are considered more attractive to males than those with a ratio of 0.8, who are considered to have a more masculine figure. This is because they are perceived to be able to have children more and to be more fertile and healthy. === Mate retention === Males have developed behaviours that help them to retain a mate, also known as mate guarding, in order to enhance reproductive success in long-term relationships. Examples are intersexual manipulations which involves the male manipulating the way his partner views their current relationship and to repulse her from other relationships.Starratt, V. G., & Alesia, M. N. (2014). Male adaptations to retain a mate. In Shackelford, V. A., & Shackelford, T. K. (2014). Evolutionary perspectives on human sexual psychology and behaviour 197-205. New York:Springer. He could do this by enhancing his own value or decreasing the value of other males. In extreme cases, some men have developed intersexual adaptations that restrict their partner from interacting with other males, including the use of violence. By doing this, women are less likely to stray from her current relationship, even if it is due to fear. On the other hand, intrasexual manipulations are used to reduce any other options for the females, which could include decreasing their partner's value or make it clear to other males that the female is 'theirs' by using possessive techniques such as holding her hand in public. === Parental investment === With regards to parental investment, males are much more wary when investing in offspring as they cannot guarantee that the child is theirs.Trivers, R. L. (1972). \\"Parental investment and sexual selection \\". In Campbell, B, (Ed.), Sexual selection and the descent of man, 1871-1971, 136‚Äì179. London: Heinemann. Therefore, as an adaption, males tend to only invest in offspring if there are high levels of commitment and if they were produced in a long- term relationship as opposed to short-term relationships. === Short-term mating === Human males have also developed an adaptation in which they have a desire for short-term relationships more than females do. This is because men hardly have any investment obligation, whereas a female has to carry a child for nine months if she was to fall pregnant after the sexual encounter. Evolutionarily, it is thought that males have a desire to reproduce as much as they can, and short-term relationships are a good way to inseminate many women with his sperm in order for his genes to continue through generations. There is much evidence for how this short-term mating has evolved psychologically for males, beginning with the desire for a variety of sex partners. It seems that a larger percentage of men, in every culture of the world, desire more than one sex partner in one month compared to women. Furthermore, men are more likely than women to have sexual intercourse with someone having known them for only one hour, one day, one week or one month. === Problems === However, there are some adaptive problems in short-term mating that men must solve; one of these is avoiding commitment and women who might not have sex with the male until they have a signal of commitment or investment. This would reduce the number of partners a male could pursue and succeed with. == Psychological adaptation in females == Female sex-specific adaptations provide evidence of special design for the purpose of increasing fitness and in turn, reproductive success.Williams, G.C. (1996). Adaptation and natural selection. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. For example, mate choice, rape aversion tactics and pregnancy sickness are all female-specific psychological adaptations, identified through empirical research, found to increase genetic contributions through survival and reproduction.Alcock, J. (1993). Animal behaviour: An evolutionary approach. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer. === Mate-choice as an adaptation === Women can use facial cues such as strong jawlines to detect testosterone presence. A psychological adaptation for the purpose of reproductive success can be seen in female mate choice. David Buss, an evolutionary psychologist, examines the fundamental principles of selection pressures that create human mate preferences in his contribution to the publication The Adapted Mind.Buss, D. M. (1995). Mate Preference Mechanisms: Consequences for Partner Choice and Intrasexual Competition. In J.H. Barkow, L. Cosmides & J. Tooby. (Eds.), The adapted mind: Evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture. (pp. 249-266). New York: Oxford University Press. Females have evolved psychological procedures that affect mating decisions in relation to certain male physical attributes and behaviours.Symons, D. (1979). The evolution of the human mind. New York: Oxford University Press. Robert Trivers, an evolutionary biologist, outlines the evolutionary basis of these preferences in relation to parental investment and sexual selection.Trivers, R. L. (1972). Parental investment and sexual selection. In B. Campbell (Eds.), Sexual Selection and the Descent of Man. (pp. 136‚Äì179). Aldinc: Chicago. He proposes that females have adapted a preference to mate with males who display both an ability and willingness to invest vital resources for the survival of the female and her offspring. Research suggests females are able to use external cues displayed by males such as territory or physical possessions. For example, women are able to evaluate the long-term presence of testosterone in men by observing facial testosterone cues.Waynforth, D. (2011). Mate choice and sexual selection. In V. Swami (Eds.), Evolutionary Psychology: a critical introduction. (pp. 107-130). West Sussex: John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Testosterone stimulates craniofacial development and results in a squarer jaw and consequently, a more masculine appearance. Women in the fertile phase of their menstrual cycle perceive masculine faces as healthier and more attractive than feminine male faces. Females show a psychological adaptation to detect mate quality using these hormonal cues which display the male's fitness and reproductive value. Males who display testosterone cues show a female that they are able to offset the high physiological costs such as immunosuppressant effects. === Rape avoidance === Research proposes that women have evolved psychological mechanisms specifically designed to motivate rape-avoidance behaviours or strategies. This is because rape poses severe costs for the female such as pregnancy, physical harm, injury or death, relationship abandonment and self-esteem depletion.Thornhill, R., & Palmer, C. T. (2000). A natural history of rape. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. The greatest cost to the female is the circumvention of her mate choice, which threatens reproductive success, resulting in the possession of adaptations in response.Trivers, R. L. (1972). Parental investment and sexual selection. In B. Campbell (Ed.), Sexual selection and the descent of man: 1871-1971. (pp. 136‚Äì179). Chicago: Aldine. Evidence suggests that a number of female-specific traits have evolved in order to reduce the risks associated with experiencing rape. The body-guard hypothesisWilson, M., & Mesnick, S. L. (1997). An empirical test of the bodyguard hypothesis. In Feminism and evolutionary biology (pp. 505-511). Springer US. proposes that rape-avoidance drives women's mate preferences for physically strong or dominant males. Women may also form groups with men and women as a protective alliance against potential rapists. Psychological pain experienced following rape is also identified as an adaptive process designed to focus the female on the social circumstances surrounding the rape for future prevention. Evidence for this as an adaptation can be seen in reproductive-aged women who are found to experience more psychological pain following rape due to an increased risk of conception. Research also suggests that women in the fertile phase of their menstrual cycle perform fewer risky behaviours that could potentially result in the risk of rape. Women's capacity to resist rape also changes relative to their menstrual cycle; females in the fertile phase show an increase in handgrip strength when placed in a threatening, sexually coercive scenario. Susceptibility to signs of a male's coerciveness is also identified to be better in fertile women. === Pregnancy sickness === One psychological adaptation found solely in women is pregnancy sickness. This is an adaptation resulting from natural selection for the purpose of avoiding toxic-containing foods during pregnancy. Margaret Profet, an evolutionary biologist, provides evidence for this adaptation in a literature review on pregnancy sickness.Profet, M. (1992). Pregnancy sickness as adaptation: A deterrent to maternal ingestion of teratogens. In J. Barkow, L. Cosmides, & J. Tooby (Eds.), The adapted mind: Evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture (pp. 327-366). New York: Oxford University Press. Particular plant foods, whilst unharmful to adults, can contain toxins (e.g. teratogens) that are dangerous for developing embryos and can potentially cause birth defects such as facial asymmetry. Evidence lies in the finding that women who experience more extreme cases of pregnancy sickness tend to be less likely to miscarry or have babies with birth defects. This fits the criteria for an adaptation as it enhances fitness and increases reproductive success ‚Äì it results in greater fertility of the mother and contributes to the health of the developing embryo. Researchers dispute whether this is actually a psychological adaptation, however evidence advocates it is the result of strong selective pressures in our hereditary past. For example, the toxins are found only in natural wild plant foods, not processed foods in our modern-day environment. Furthermore, pregnant women experiencing sickness have been found to avoid particular bitter or pungent smelling foods, potentially containing toxins. Pregnancy induced sickness only typically occurs 3 weeks after conception, around the time when the embryo has started forming major organs and is therefore at the highest risk. It is also a cross-cultural universal adaptation, a suggestion it is an innate mechanism. ==See also== * Adaptive behavior (ecology) * Adaptive bias * Cognitive module * Dual inheritance theory * Evolutionary developmental psychology * Evolutionary psychology * Human behavioral ecology * Instinct * Modularity of mind ==References * Category:Evolutionary psychology ","title":"Psychological adaptation"},{"id":"2232191","text":"The Vickers K machine gun, known as the Vickers Gas Operated (Vickers G.O.) in British service, was a rapid-firing machine gun developed and manufactured for use in aircraft by Vickers-Armstrongs. The high rate of fire was needed for the small period of time when the gunner would be able to fire at an attacking aircraft. The weapon was also adopted for land use during World War II. ==Development== The Vickers K was a development of the Vickers-Berthier (VB) light machine gun, adopted in 1932 by the Indian Army.Weeks, John, World War II Small Arms, New York: Galahad Books (1979), , p. 88-89 The VB, like the Bren light machine gun, used a locking tilting breechblock. However, unlike the Bren, the VB locked its breech only at the last moment of forward travel and this enabled the development of the Vickers K also known as the \\"Vickers Gas Operated\\" (VGO) or \\"Vickers GO\\" . With lighter moving parts and the VB locking design, the Vickers K had an adjustable rate of fire between 950 and 1,200 rounds per minute; faster than the German MG34. The weapon was adopted for British service as the VGO. It was test-flown with a large 300-round pan magazine, and beat the .303 Browning in reliability. However, the wide pan would have caused problems to accommodate, since it would have interfered with wing structures. When the belt-fed Browning Mark II was selected as the standard machine-gun armament for RAF aircraft, the VGO became redundant for the RAF. It continued to be used by the Fleet Air Arm until 1945. ==Variants== Some were made in 7.7mm for the Belgians before the war and at least one example survives in a European museum. ===VGO No.2 Mk.1.=== The Vickers class K/Vickers G.O. machine gun is a gas-operated weapon, firing from an open bolt (thus making it non-synchronizable for firing through a spinning propeller) in full automatic mode only. Its gas cylinder is located below the barrel, and a long-stroke gas piston operates a vertically tilting bolt. Feed is from top- mounted flat pan magazines with a nominal capacity of 100 rounds, although it was customary to load only 96 or 97 rounds to ensure reliable feeding. The gun is fitted with a single spade grip at the rear of receiver, with trigger to control fire. In ground use, it was normally mounted on single or twin pintle mounts on various jeeps and trucks. ===Vickers GO No.2 Mk.1 Land Service=== Originally intended for RAF airfield defence units, these guns were remanufactured from original Vickers G.O. No.1 Mk.1 aircraft guns. A number of these ‚ÄòVickers G.O. Land Service‚Äô machine guns found their way to a variety of British commando and reconnaissance units which operated in Europe during 1944 and 1945. The Land variant has the spade grip replaced with a \\"semi bullpup\\" short stock at the rear and a pistol grip with trigger below the receiver. A short forend or a folding carrying handle are added below the gas cylinder, and a folding bipod is attached to the gas block. New iron sights are provided on folding bases. ===Vickers G.O. Camera Gun=== A camera gun version was made for training. The body was of cast metal. The grip and trigger mechanism were realistic. Gunners in training exposed film when \\"shooting\\" at attacking aircraft and these images were analysed later. This was a technique developed in World War I with Lewis Camera Guns. ==Combat use== SAS returning from a 1943 patrol in North Africa with their twin-mounted Vickers K machine guns. The Vickers K was fitted to light and medium bombers in RAF service such as the Fairey Battle and Handley Page Hampden. It was also used in gun turrets, such as the dorsal turret in the Bristol Blenheim, the nose turret in the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley and the rear of the cockpit in the Fairey Battle. It was the standard Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm \\"Telegraphist Air Gunner\\" machine gun, on British built carrier (Torpedo Strike Reconnaissance) aircraft - the Fairey Swordfish, the Fairey Albacore and the Fairey Barracuda.Wings of the Navy - Captain Eric Brown, Pilot Press, London 1980 As supplies of air-cooled .303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns increased the Vickers G.O. was phased out of use with the RAF. These machine guns were then reallocated from RAF stocks to units of the British and Commonwealth armies. The gun continued in service with the Fleet Air Arm and its last recorded use by the navy was by 812 Squadron RNAS Barracudas in anti piracy patrols off Hong Kong in October 1945. The Long Range Desert Group was supplied with large numbers of the Vickers G.O. for use on its vehicles. They were used in single or custom built twin mountings. The Special Air Service adopted it for their hit and run tactics, mounting it in pairs on their jeeps. Over the years, it was assumed by some that the latter services took the phased-out VGO because they could obtain no other suitable machine guns but with its high rate of fire and low- friction locking design (which proved resistant to jams from sand), the LRDG and SAS found the G.O. markedly superior to either the .303 in (7.7 mm) water- cooled Vickers or the Bren gun.Dunlap, Roy F., Ordnance Went Up Front, Samworth Press (1948), pp. 142-144 In a similar manner, the Airborne Reconnaissance Squadron of the Reconnaissance Corps mounted the VGO on jeeps when they were attached to the 1st Airborne Division during Operation Market- Garden in September 1944. Royal Marine and Army Commandos used the VGO for infantry support/squad automatic weapon briefly around D-Day. In military terminology, it was known as Gun, Machine, Vickers G.O. .303-inch. In the Coastal Forces of the Royal Navy, the Vickers K began to replace the Lewis gun on board Motor Torpedo Boats, Motor Launches and other light craft, from 1942 onwards.John Lambert and Al Ross, Allied Coastal Forces of World War II: Vol III Vosper MTBs and US Elcos, Conway Marine Press 1993, (p. 25) ==See also== * MG 81 machine gun * ShKAS machine gun ==References * Vickers K (Vickers machine gun site) * Vickers K * \\"A Modern Aircraft Gun\\" a 1939 Flight article on the Vickers K Machine Gun.

The gens Tarquinia was a plebeian family at ancient Rome, usually associated with Lucius Tarquinius Priscus and Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the fifth and seventh Kings of Rome. Most of the Tarquinii who appear in history are connected in some way with this dynasty, but a few appear during the later Republic, and others from inscriptions, some dating as late as the fourth century AD. ==Origin== The legendary origin of the Tarquinii who reigned at Rome begins with Demaratus of Corinth, a member of the house of the Bacchiadae at Corinth, which was expelled in 657 BC.Livy, i. 34.Dionysius, iii. 46.Pliny the Elder, xxxv. 5. s. 43.Tacitus, Annales, xi. 14. Demaratus settled at Tarquinii in Etruria, where he married an Etruscan noblewoman, and had two sons, Lucius and Arruns, who took the surname Tarquinius after the town of their birth. Denied political advancement due to his father's foreign birth, Lucius, encouraged by his wife, Tanaquil, determined to settle at Rome, where he could hope to attain high station based solely on his merits. He fell into the retinue of Ancus Marcius, the fourth Roman king, becoming his trusted advisor. Since the Roman monarchy was elected, rather than strictly hereditary, when Marcius died, Tarquinius successfully argued that he should be named the next king, in preference to the sons of Marcius.Livy, i. 34, 35.Dionysius, iii. 46‚Äì49. Family tree showing relations to Lucretia and Brutus Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and last Roman king, was said to have been the son or grandson of the elder Tarquin, while Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, one of the first Roman consuls was his cousin.Livy, i. 38, 46, 57. Other Tarquinii are mentioned as part of this family, although it is not entirely clear how some of them were related. It is likely that there were additional kings and perhaps other members of the Tarquin dynasty during this period.Cornell, The Beginnings of Rome, pp. 138‚Äì141. It is not clear whether the early Tarquinii should be regarded as patricians or plebeians. The consul Collatinus is generally regarded as a patrician,Broughton, vol. I, p. 2. but as Cornell explains, none of the families that claimed descent from or kinship with the Roman kings were considered patrician in later times, while none of Rome's leading patrician families is represented among the kings. The patricians may have chosen the king, but were probably not eligible for the office, and it is unlikely that the kings themselves were admitted to the patriciate once chosen.Cornell, The Beginnings of Rome, pp. 142, 143. It may be that Collatinus was granted patrician status on the overthrow of the Roman monarchy; but as he then accepted exile according to the demand of his colleague, Lucius Junius Brutus, the matter becomes academic, as there was no tradition of patrician Tarquinii at Rome in later times. The Tarquinii of the later Republic were plebeians. The nomen Tarquinius appears to be the Latin form of the Etruscan Tarchna, apparently the same as the Tarchunies named in one of the frescoes in the famous Fran√ßois Tomb at Vulci.Grant, History of Rome, p. 23.Cornell, The Beginnings of Rome, pp. 135, 138, 139. The nomen is certainly derived from the city of Tarquinii, in Etruscan Tarchna or Tarchuna, after its legendary founder, the folk-hero Tarchon, although in historical times the Tarchna family had branches at both Tarquinii and Caere.Grant, History of Rome, p. 23, Roman Myths, pp. 24, 74, 153, 154. ==Members== Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, Tarquinius Superbus (1867). The king suggests to his son, Sextus, how to bring the city of Gabii under his control, by silently lopping the heads off the tallest poppies in his garden. * Arruns Tarquinius, the elder son of Demaratus, died shortly before his father, who accordingly left his entire fortune to his younger son, Lucius, unaware that Arruns' wife was pregnant, and that his first grandson would inherit nothing.Dionysius, iii. 46, 47, 50. * Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, or Tarquin the Elder, the fifth Roman king, according to tradition conquered a number of Latin and Sabine, built the Cloaca Maxima and drained the Roman Forum, laid out the Circus Maximus, doubled the size of the senate, and the number of the equites, the Roman cavalry, and instituted the Ludi Romani.Livy, i. 35‚Äì38.Dionysius, iii. 49‚Äì73.Grant, Roman Myths, p. 154.Cornell, The Beginnings of Rome, pp. 130, 138‚Äì140. * Arruns Tarquinius Ar. f. Collatinus, the first grandson of Demaratus, was deprived of his inheritance when his grandfather died shortly after his elder son, unaware that his daughter-in-law was pregnant. According to tradition, young Arruns became known as Egerius, the needy one. However, when he was grown, and his uncle had become King of Rome, he received the command of the Roman garrison at Collatia, thereby obtaining the surname Collatinus.Livy, i. 34, 38. * Tarquinia L. f., daughter of the elder Tarquin, married Servius Tullius, and was the mother of the two Tulliae.Livy, i. 39, 42, 46.Dionysius, iv. 28. * Lucius Tarquinius L. f. Superbus, the seventh and last king of Rome, was the son, or more likely grandson, of the elder Tarquin. He overthrew his predecessor, Servius Tullius, and behaved as a tyrant, but he also established Roman hegemony over the Latin League, and the Hernici; made war on the Volsci, founded colonies at Signia and Circeii, and conquered Gabii. He built the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitol, but was overthrown by members of his own family and the Roman aristocracy in 509 BC.Livy, i. 46‚Äì60, ii. 1‚Äì7, 9, 18‚Äì21.Dionysius, iv. 6‚Äì8, 28‚Äì85, v. 14‚Äì16, 50‚Äì54,Grant, Roman Myths, pp. 165, 166, 252 (note 95). * Arruns L. f. Tarquinius, the brother of Tarquin the Proud, married Tullia, the younger daughter of Servius Tullius. His wife was ambitious, while he was not; his equally ambitious brother had married Tullia's demure elder sister. Lucius and Tullia murdered their spouses, and married one another.Livy, i. 42, 46.Dionysius, iv. 28‚Äì30. * Lucius Tarquinius Ar. f. Ar. n. Collatinus, one of the commanders in the army of his cousin, Tarquin the Proud. He boasted of the fidelity of his wife, Lucretia, which excited the passions of the king's son, Sextus. Sextus' rape of Lucretia set in motion the events that led to the overthrow of the Roman monarchy, but Lucretia took her own life out of shame. Collatinus was elected one of the first consuls, but was called upon to resign and enter into exile by his cousin and colleague, Lucius Junius Brutus, so that none of the hated Tarquins would rule at Rome, and to this demand he reluctantly consented.Livy, i. 57‚Äì60, ii. 2.Dionysius, iv. 64 ff.Cassius Dio, fragmentum, 24 (ed. Reimar).Cicero, De Republica, ii. 25, De Officiis, iii. 10. * Tarquinia L. f., the sister of Tarquin the Proud, married Marcus Junius Brutus, and was the mother of Marcus, whom the king put to death, perceiving in him a potential threat, and Lucius, who survived by feigning stupidity, later becoming one of the first consuls. * Titus Tarquinius L. f. L. n., the eldest son of Tarquin the Proud, led the Roman exiles at the Battle of Lake Regillus, circa 498 BC. Although wounded in the fighting, he survived, the last of Tarquin's sons. * Arruns Tarquinius L. f. L. n., the second son of Tarquin the Proud, led the Etruscan cavalry at the Battle of Silva Arsia in 509 BC, where he and his cousin, the consul Brutus, mortally wounded one another. * Sextus Tarquinius L. f. L. n., the youngest son of Tarquin the Proud, whose rape of Lucretia led to the downfall of the Roman monarchy. He took refuge at Gabii, which his father had conquered after Sextus had put its leading men to death, but was soon assassinated.Livy, i. 56‚Äì58. * Publius Tarquinius, a native of Laurentum, together with his brother, Marcus, were among the leaders of a conspiracy in 500 BC to seize a number of defensible positions at Rome, and open the city gates to the king and his allies. Tormented by visions in their sleep, the two brothers revealed the plot to the consul Servius Sulpicius Camerinus Cornutus, and were rewarded when the other conspirators were apprehended. It is unknown how they were related to the king.Dionysius, v. 53‚Äì57. * Marcus Tarquinius, the brother of Publius, together with whom he revealed a plot to restore the Tarquins in 500 BC. * Tarquinia, one of the Vestal Virgins, said to have dedicated a field adjacent to the Campus Martius to Mars, at some time following the expulsion of the kings. The freshly reaped wheat was thrown into the Tiber, where it came to anchor a new island, the Insula Tiberina, sacred in later times.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Poplicola\\", 8. * Publius Tarquinius, tribune of the plebs in 91 BC, supported the laws proposed by his colleague, Marcus Livius Drusus, whose reforms might have averted the Social War.Obsequens, 114. * Lucius Tarquinius, a participant in the conspiracy of Catiline, who attempted to implicate Marcus Licinius Crassus.Sallust, Bellum Catilinae, 48. * Tarquinia, buried at Castellum Elefantum in Numidia, aged thirty-five.. * Appia Tarquinia C. f., named in an inscription from Tarracina in Latium, dating to the first half of the first century AD.. * Tarquinius L. f., named in an inscription from Tarracina. * Gnaeus Tarquinius, named in an inscription from Hispania Baetica.. * Lucius Tarquinus L. l.

Zhang was a member of the Chinese team for the 2004 Olympic Games, as well as the 2002, 2003, 2005, and 2006 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. She is one of China's most successful female gymnasts and was the first Chinese woman to medal in an all-around competition at the World Championships. She is married to 2004 Olympic champion Teng Haibin. ==Gymnastics career 2002‚Äì04 === Zhang won four gold medals at the 2002 Asian Games (team, all-around, uneven bars, and floor exercise) and the 2003 Asian Championships (team, all-around, balance beam, and floor exercise). She became China's first female medalist in a world all-around competition by winning the bronze medal at the 2003 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. She followed this feat by becoming the second Chinese woman to win an Olympic all-around medal, also a bronze, at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. (Liu Xuan had won the bronze in the previous Olympics after the gold medalist, Andreea RƒÉducan of Romania, was disqualified.) The Chinese team finished 7th at the 2004 Olympics after counting a fall on bars, two falls on beam, and two falls on floor, one of them from Zhang. However, Zhang won an individual bronze medal in the all-around competition behind Carly Patterson of the United States and Svetlana Khorkina of Russia. She also competed in the balance beam event final, her strongest event, but fell and placed 6th with a score of 9.237. Without the 0.5 deduction for the fall, she would have edged out Romania's Alexandra Eremia for the bronze. === 2005‚Äì06 === Zhang went on to win the all-around at the 2005 Chinese National Championships and the 2005 East Asian Games. At the 2005 World Championships, she was hampered by injuries and had to withdraw from the all-around final, but finished 4th in the balance beam final with a score of 9.487. As the leader of China's 2006 World Championships team, she competed on all four events and helped the team qualify to the final in 2nd place, behind the United States. During the team final, she contributed to China's victory with strong routines on vault (scoring 14.525 under a new system), balance beam (15.950), and floor exercise (14.800). The win for the Chinese team was its first ever. She qualified to the balance beam final with the top score, 16.075, but finished 4th in the final with a score of 15.275 after injuring her ankle by falling down a flight of stairs the day before the competition. Zhang also competed at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar, where the Chinese women captured their seventh straight team title. She went on to help the Chinese women sweep all but one of the gold medals in the women's gymnastics competition, winning the balance beam title ahead of her teammate Han Bing. === 2007‚Äì09 === Over the course of the two years following the 2006 World Championships, Zhang struggled to maintain the level of difficulty in her routines. As a result, she did not qualify to represent China at the 2007 World Championships. She continued her attempt to make a second Olympic team by increasing her difficulty, but struggled with consistency. At the 2008 Chinese National Championships, she won a silver medal on balance beam, partly thanks to errors by many other competitors. Zhang was named to the Chinese Olympic training squad but was not selected to compete at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. In an interview in early 2009, she said she would retire soon. She officially announced her retirement before the 11th Chinese National Games in September 2009. There, in her last competition, she performed on vault, balance beam, and floor exercise to help the Beijing provincial team win the bronze medal. She is currently a coach for the Beijing team. ==Floor music== * \\"Barcelona\\" by Johnny Tesh (2003) * \\"A New Life\\" by Burkhard Dallwitz (2005‚Äì06) ==ReferencesZhang Nan's photos at GymBox Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:Chinese female artistic gymnasts Category:Gymnasts at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships Category:Olympic bronze medalists for China Category:Olympic gymnasts of China Category:Gymnasts from Beijing Category:Olympic medalists in gymnastics Category:Medalists at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Asian Games medalists in gymnastics Category:Gymnasts at the 2002 Asian Games Category:Gymnasts at the 2006 Asian Games Category:Asian Games gold medalists for China Category:Medalists at the 2002 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 2006 Asian Games Category:Universiade medalists in gymnastics Category:Universiade gold medalists for China Category:Universiade bronze medalists for China Category:Medalists at the 2005 Summer Universiade ","title":"Zhang Nan (gymnast)"},{"id":"2232241","text":"Dipa Ma in Barre, Massachusetts, 1978 Nani Bala Barua (March 25, 1911 - September 1989), better known as Dipa Ma, was an Indian meditation teacher of Theravada Buddhism and was of Barua descent. She was a prominent Buddhist master in Asia and also taught in the United States where she influenced the American branch of the Vipassana movement.https://www.buddhistdoor.net/features/dipa-ma-an-extraordinary- female-buddhist-master-in-the-twentieth-century == Early life == Nani Bala Barua was born in on March 25, 1911 in a small village in Chittagong, East Bengal, then in British India but now part of Bangladesh.Schmidt, Amy. Dipa Ma: The Life and Legacy of a Buddhist Master - the chief source for her biography In her childhood she showed an exceptional interest in Buddhist rituals and preferred to study rather than play. She very much wanted to attend school but in 1923 at the age of twelve she was married and later went to live with her husband, an engineer, in Rangoon. He soon left to work in Burma, leaving her with her in-laws. Eventually she moved to Burma to join her husband. In 1929 when Nani was 18 her mother died unexpectedly, leaving behind a baby boy named Bijoy which Nani and her husband took to raise in Burma, as they had not yet had a child. At the age of 35 Nani conceived and gave birth to her first child, a baby girl, who fell ill and died at three months of age. Four years later, in 1950, Nani gave birth to a daughter, Dipa, whereupon Nani began to be called Dipa Ma \\"Mother of Dipa\\" as her daughter's survival was a momentous event. This was followed by yet another loss of a child (her first son) at birth, the sudden death of her husband in 1957, and subsequent extreme grief and physical pains. ==Meditation== After her husband died, Dipa Ma was extremely unhappy. One day a doctor suggested that she learn how to meditate. She attended her first meditation retreat at the Kamayut Meditation Center in Rangoon. She soon after attended her second retreat, at the Thathana Yeiktha center, where the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw was teacher-in-residence. There she experienced the first stage of enlightenment. In 1963 she was chosen to study the siddhis or spiritual powers with the Indian master Anagarika Munindra, a senior student of Mahasi Sayadaw. According to scholars, the Visuddhimagga is one of the extremely rare texts within the enormous literatures of various forms of Jainism, Buddhism, and Hinduism to give explicit details about how spiritual masters were thought to actually manifest supernormal abilities. Abilities such as flying through the air, walking through solid obstructions, diving into the ground, walking on water and so forth are performed by changing one element, such as earth, into another element, such as air. The individual must master kasina meditation before this is possible. Dipa Ma, who trained via the Visuddhimagga, was said to demonstrate these abilities. ==Teaching career== In 1967, she returned to India, moving to Calcutta where she taught meditation. Her first formal student was her neighbor, Malati Barua, a widow trying to raise six young children alone. Believing that enlightenment was possible in any environment, Dipa Ma devised practices that her new student could carry out at home. In the 1970s, she was a teacher of Sylvia Boorstein, Joseph Goldstein, Jack Kornfield, Michelle Levey, and Sharon Salzberg, who later became prominent teachers in the United States. In the early 1980s Dipa Ma taught at the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Massachusetts. ==Death== She died at the age of 78, in 1989 in India, while bowing before a statue of the Buddha. She was survived by her daughter Dipa, an employee of the Indian government, and her grandson Rishi during her final years. ==ReferencesSources== * * Knaster, Mirka Ph.D., \\"Living this Life Fully: The Stories and Teachings of Munindra\\".

Providence had transported convicts from Britain to New South Wales and was on her way to China to pick up a cargo to take back to Britain. The Empire of Germany claimed Ujelang Atoll along with the rest of the Marshall Islands in 1884. It was the private property of German trading companies from 1880, who maintained copra plantations on the largest island, also called Ujelang. After World War I, the island came under the South Seas Mandate of the Empire of Japan. In 1935 there were only some 40 inhabitants. During World War II, the island was occupied by the United States Army's Company I, 111th Infantry Regiment, which landed on 22 April 1944 and which used the island as a staging area before redeployment to Peleliu on 1 February 1945. Following the end of World War II, the island came under the control of the United States as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands until the independence of the Marshall Islands in 1986. The island became a relocation center for the people of Enewetak Atoll in 1947 (due to atomic tests on that island from 1948 to 1958). The population on Ujelang grew from 145 in 1947 to 342 in 1973, despite near-famine and epidemics, especially in the 50s, due to the scarce supply of fish and vegetables. The inhabitants wanted to return to Enewetak and a highly publicized meeting was held at Ujelang in 1979 to discuss the issue. The United States government was represented by a variety of personnel, primarily Department of Energy (DOE) and Department of Interior representatives. The DOE's legal counsel was William L. Brown. The meeting gained national attention because the CBS television show 60 Minutes went along and publicized the islanders‚Äô desire to return to Enewetak with an extended film segment that ran several times. The clean-up of Enewetak was essentially done except for several areas which were declared unsafe for human habitation until 2010. Hundreds of new coconut trees were planted and vast amounts of sediment and other material contaminated by radioactivity were entombed under a giant concrete dome. The next year, in 1980, all Ujelang inhabitants were returned to Enewetak. A hundred or so soon returned to Ujelang because Enewetak could not support so many people, but their stay on Ujelang was short-lived. In 1989 Ujelang became permanently uninhabited. Ujelang Atoll is currently owned by the Enewetak Council and is now very rarely visited. ==See also== * UjlƒÅn volcanic complex * Desert island * List of islands ==References== *Levesque, Rodrique, and Rodrigue Leresque, eds.

Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a rural town and locality in the Shire of Mareeba in Far North Queensland, Australia. The town is above sea level on the confluence of the Barron River, Granite Creek and Emerald Creek. Between 2008 and 2013, it was within the Tablelands Region. The town's name is derived from an Aboriginal word meaning meeting of the waters.queenslandplaces.com.au/mareeba ==History== Prior to European settlement, the area around Mareeba was inhabited by the Muluridji people. They maintained a hunter/gatherer existence in the area between Mount Carbine, Mareeba, Rumula (near Julatten) and Woodville (near Canoona), mainly concentrated between Biboohra and Mount Molloy. In the local Aboriginal language, Mareeba means meeting of the waters - referring to the point at which the Barron River is joined by Granite Creek. On 26 May 1875 James Venture Mulligan became the first European officially to see the future site of Mareeba when he rode up the eastern bank of the Barron River, and passed the junctions of Emerald Creek and Granite Creek. The Mareeba area was first settled by Europeans in 1877 by John Atherton, who arrived with cattle at Emerald End, which is just north of the town today. Mareeba quickly became a busy coach stop for Cobb & Co on the road from Port Douglas to Herberton. When the railway arrived in 1893, Mareeba grew into a busy town.

In 223 BC Antiochus III, the successor of Seleucus Ceraunus, appointed him to the command of all Asia Minor on the western side of Mount Taurus. Achaeus recovered all the districts which Attalus had gained for the Seleucids once more; but being falsely accused by Hermeias, the minister to Antiochus, of intending to revolt, he did so in self-defence, assumed the title of king, and ruled over the whole of Asia on the western side of the Taurus. As long as Antiochus was engaged in the war with Ptolemy, he would not march against Achaeus; but upon the conclusion of a treaty with Ptolemy, he crossed the Taurus, uniting his forces with Attalus, and in one campaign deprived Achaeus of his dominions and took Sardis (with the exception of the citadel).

A genial and kindly clergyman, he published over 100 papers each on Lepidoptera, sixty or so on Hymenoptera and smaller numbers on each of ten other insect orders. His best known work is A list of the beetles of Ireland (Coleoptera) a collaboration with J N Halbert published in 1902. A graduate of Dublin University, he spent most of his life in Co Armagh, first as a teacher in Armagh town, then as Rector in Poyntzpass. Later in life he spent time in various parts of Co Down and Co Louth. The fact that he was elected a Special Life Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society of London gives some measure of the esteem in which he was held. Johnson was a careful and assiduous worker, careful to send dubiously identified specimens to others. His Ichneumonidae were sent to the Swede Per Abraham Roman, for instance. Richard Strauss once said of himself \\"I am not a composer of the first rate, but I am a splendid composer of the second\\". The same may said of William Johnson. He died at Rostrevor on 28 March 1934. Johnson's Coleoptera Collection is in the Ulster Museum, Belfast. The Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera and other orders are in the National Museum of Ireland, Dublin.

Since many regions changed significantly after the Velvet Divorce of 1993, here is list of their original names and current regions they approximately correspond to: ===Czech (Socialist) Republic=== (the names are in Czech) * Praha * St≈ôedoƒçesk√Ω kraj: today Central Bohemian Region * Jihoƒçesk√Ω kraj: today South Bohemian Region * Z√°padoƒçesk√Ω kraj (West Bohemian Region): today Plze≈à Region and Karlovy Vary Region * Severoƒçesk√Ω kraj (North Bohemian Region): today √öst√≠ nad Labem Region, and most of Liberec Region * V√Ωchodoƒçesk√Ω kraj (East Bohemian Region): today Hradec Kr√°lov√© Region, Pardubice Region, and small parts of Liberec Region and Vysoƒçina Region * Jihomoravsk√Ω kraj (South Moravian Region): today South Moravian Region, and most of Vysoƒçina Region and Zl√≠n Region * Severomoravsk√Ω kraj (North Moravian Region): today Moravian- Silesian Region, Olomouc Region, and part of Zl√≠n Region ===Slovak (Socialist) Republic=== (the names are in Slovak) * Bratislava: today a part of the Bratislava Region * Z√°padoslovensk√Ω kraj (West Slovak Region): Trnava Region, Nitra Region, most of Bratislava Region, and a small part of Trenƒç√≠n Region * Stredoslovensk√Ω kraj (Central Slovak Region): today ≈Ωilina Region, Bansk√° Bystrica Region, and a large part of Trenƒç√≠n Region * V√Ωchodoslovensk√Ω kraj (East Slovak Region): today Pre≈°ov Region and Ko≈°ice Region ==History== Czechoslovakia between 1918‚Äì28 (with five provinces/lands ‚Äì Slovakia and Subcarpathian Rus newly created) Czechoslovakia since December 1, 1928; state administration was unified in both ‚Äì former Austrian or Hungarian ‚Äì parts of the state, while number of provinces reduced to four (Moravia and Czech Silesia merged) \\"Small, but ours\\": Czecho-Slovakia in 1938‚Äì39, with Slovakia and Subcarpathian Ruthenia as autonomous regions while the Sudetenland and southern Slovakia and Subcarpathian Ruthenia are ceded to Nazi Germany and Hungary *1918-1923: different systems based on former Austrian territories (Kingdom of Bohemia, Margraviate of Moravia, and Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia) and former Hungarian counties in the north (later forming Slovakia (21 counties) and Subcarpathian Ruthenia (4 counties)) were reorganized into three provinces (, ‚Äì literally \\"lands\\") of Bohemia-Moravia-Silesia, 21 counties (≈æupy) of Slovakia, and 4 counties of Subcarpathian Ruthenia (today's Zakarpattia Oblast in Ukraine); all provinces and counties were further divided into districts (okresy) *1923-1927: like above, except that the above counties were replaced by 6 (grand) counties ((veƒæ)≈æupy) in Slovakia and 1 (grand) county in Subcarpathian Ruthenia, and the number and frontiers of districts were changed on these two territories *1928-1938: 4 provinces: Bohemia, Moravia-Silesia, Slovakia and Subcarpathian Ruthenia; divided into districts *late 1938-March 1939: like above, but Slovakia and Subcarpathian Ruthenia were promoted to \\"autonomous lands\\", while the border regions were ceded to Germany (so-called Sudetenland) and Hungary (southern parts of Slovakia and Subcarpathian Ruthenia) *1939-1945: Bohemia and Moravia became the protectorate Germany, the remainder of Subcarpathian Ruthenia annexed by Hungary, while Slovakia was nominally independent *1945-1948: like 1928-1938, except that Subcarpathian Ruthenia became part of the Soviet Union in 1945 *1949-1960: 19 regions divided in 270 districts; Czech historical provinces/lands abolished *1960-1992: see above Category:Government of Czechoslovakia Czechoslovakia ","title":"Administrative divisions of Czechoslovakia"},{"id":"2232328","text":"African ground squirrels (genus Xerus) form a taxon of squirrels under the subfamily Xerinae. They are only found in Africa. There is another African ground squirrel of the genus Atlantoxerus, the Atlantoxerus getulus present in southwestern Morocco and northern Western Sahara. It is invasive in the Canary Islands since an introduction in 1971. There are four species of African ground squirrels divided into three subgenera: *Genus Xerus **Subgenus Euxerus ***Striped ground squirrel, Xerus erythropus (southwestern Morocco, southern Mauritania and Senegal) **Subgenus Geosciurus ***Cape ground squirrel, Xerus inauris (also: South African ground squirrel) (Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa) ***Damara ground squirrel, Xerus princeps (southwestern Angola, Namibia) **Subgenus Xerus ***Unstriped ground squirrel, Xerus rutilus (northeastern Sudan to northeastern Tanzania) The squirrels live in open woodlands, grasslands, or rocky country. They are diurnal and terrestrial, living in burrows. Their diet is roots, seeds, fruits, pods, grains, insects, small vertebrates and bird eggs. They live in colonies similar to North American prairie dogs, and have similar behavior. If kept as pets, they run free as house cats do, otherwise farmers consider them pests. Breeding in South African ground squirrels is asynchronous and there is no specific period of breeding although very few litters are seen above the ground in the months of July to October. Gestation period lasts for 48 days and the young ones are weaned after 52 days. There are one to three babies per litter. A female becomes sexually mature when she is 10 months old and a male matures at the age of 8 months. Although a female has the capability to breed throughout the year, less than 10% reproduce more than one litter in a year. The South African ground squirrel does not hibernate. These squirrels are very social and live in groups with about 1 to 3 females and 2 to 3 males. Sometimes, the number of males can exceed up to 9 with some sub-adult females. An interesting thing about this breed is that mature males like to form their own groups and there can be 19 to 20 individuals in one group. These groups are called bands. Their home range is shared with other groups which is actually quite a surprising thing, since in case of most of the mammals there is generally an extremely tough competition to get the female. The group-living instinct of this species gives it a survival opportunity from predators overweighing the disadvantage of breeding opportunities which come from competition.

It was eventually granted the status of a Roman colony and made the capital of the province of Mauretania Tingitana and, after Diocletian's reforms, the diocese of Hispania. ==Legends== Ptolemy's 1st African map, showing Roman Mauretania Tingitana The Greeks claimed that Tingis had been named for a daughter of the titan Atlas, who was supposed to support the vault of heaven nearby. They claimed that the Berber legends comported with the stories of Hercules's labors, which carried him to North Africa and the North Atlantic to retrieve the golden apples of the Hesperides. Having killed her husband Antaeus and again condemned her father to eternally supporting the firmament, Hercules slept with Tinja and fathered the Berber hero Syphax. Syphax supposedly founded the port of Tingis and named it his mother's honor after her death.. The gigantic skeleton and tomb of Antaeus were tourist attractions for ancient visitors. The Caves of Hercules, where he supposedly rested on Cape Spartel, remain one today. ==HistoryPunic port=== Tingis was founded in the early 5th centuryBC by Carthaginian colonists,. who variously recorded the name of their settlement as (), (), and (). The town is sometimes connected to the voyages of Hanno the Navigator. ===Mauretanian city=== After the Punic Wars, Carthage lost control of the colony to the Roman-allied kings of Mauretania. Its name during this time appears in Greek and Roman sources variously as Tenga, Tinga, Titga, &c.; It maintained strong ties to its Carthaginian heritage, issuing bronze coins with Punic legends reading \\"City of Titga\\" (, ), \\"City of Tinga\\" (, ), or \\"people of Tinga\\" (, ). These bore Baal or (via interpretatio Graeca) Demeter's head obverse and wheat reverse. ===Roman provincial capital=== Surviving walls from Roman Tingis Roman roads in Morocco The town came under Roman rule in the 1st century. Q.Sertorius, took and held Tingis for a number of years in the 70sBC as part of his war against Sulla's regime in Rome. Tingis grew in importance as a free city under Augustus and then as a colony under Claudius, who made it the capital of Mauritania Tingitana. As a Roman colony, it bore the formal name ,Tingis romana the \\"Julian colony of Tingis\\". Under the early empire, it began to use Latin script, issuing its bronze coins with the legend ; these bore Augustus and Agrippa's heads obverse and Baal's head reverse. As a provincial capital, Tingis developed and prospered. In the 4th century, it surpassed Volubilis when that city was left south of the Roman lines and unprotected by Roman legions. Tingis at its peak reached 20,000 inhabitants, all thoroughly romanized and mostly Christian. Tingis was famed throughout the Roman Empire for its fishing conserve industry. Under Septimius Severus, two Roman roads were constructed from Tingis: one on the Atlantic coast to Sala Colonia and the second into the mountainous interior toward Volubilis. During Diocletian's reform of Roman governmental structures in 296, Mauretania Tingitana became part of the Diocese of Hispania. Tingis remained the capital of the larger territory, maintaining its status and development. ===Later history=== Justinian and his general Belisarius, as depicted in Ravenna. The Vandals conquered and occupied Tingis around 425 before sweeping across the Roman Maghreb. Between 534 and 682, Tingis was restored to Byzantine control. Tingis was fortified and a new church erected. However, its commercial strength had waned, a change attested by its decreased issuance of coins. Tingis fell under the control of the Umayyad Caliphate as part of the Muslim conquest of North Africa in 702, after which it was reduced to a small town more commonly discussed under the name Tangier. Moussa Ibn Noussair organized the conquest of Spain from Tingis and nearby Septem in 706. ==Religion== The Christian history of Tingis started during the second half of the first century, under Claudius's rule.Cass. Dio XLVIII 45.3 Originally, the city was part of the larger province of Mauretania Caesariensis, which included most of the Roman Maghreb. Later the area was subdivided, with the eastern part keeping the former name and the newer part receiving the name of Mauretania Tingitana. It is not known exactly at what period there may have been an episcopal see at Tangier in ancient times, but in the late Middle Ages Tangier was a titular see (i.e., an honorific fiction for the appointment of curial and auxiliary bishops). For the historical reasons given above, one official list of the Roman Curia places the see in Mauretania Caesariensis. Towards the end of the third century, Tingis was the scene of the martyrdom of StMarcellus, mentioned in the Roman Martyrology on 30 October, and of St.Cassian, mentioned on 3 December. Indeed, according to tradition, the martyrdom of StMarcellus took place on 28 July 298. A small Christian community survived in Tangier as late as the 10th century. Due to its Christian past, Tangierunder the name Tingisis still a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church. ==See also== * Mauretania Tingitana * Sala Colonia * Saints Cassian and Marcellus of Tingis * Roman Empire ==ReferencesCitations=Bibliography=== * . * . * . *Rachid, Mueden.

A student of Ernst Haeckel, he graduated from the University of Jena in 1885 with a Ph.D.; he had also studied at the University of Kiel and the University of Strasbourg. From 1886 on, he worked as an instructor at the University of Strasbourg. Together with Haeckel, he participated in an expedition to Zanzibar in 1890/91. Three years later, he emigrated to the United States, where he got a post as the curator of the department of invertebrate paleontology at Princeton University. In 1899, he participated in the Peary Relief expedition, and one year later, he was naturalized as a U.S. citizen. In 1903, he moved to Pittsburgh. He became the curator of invertebrate zoology at the Carnegie Museum and from 1910 on, he was professor of physical geography at the University of Pittsburgh, where he also obtained in 1911 the additional degree of an Sc.D. In 1925, he became the chair of zoology at the University of Pittsburgh. He died in Pittsburgh on January 3, 1927. ==Work== Ortmann's thorough taxonomic studies of freshwater mussels and crustaceans with a special focus on the geographical distribution of species was a fundamental groundwork that is even valid today. In 1920, he formulated \\"Ortmann's Law of Stream Position\\", which said that a species of mussels can have different appearance depending on where in a river system the individuals live: This observation helped greatly to simplify the taxonomy of molluscs, because previously, researchers had all too often assigned such different morphotypes to different species.

(There have been slight differences in the way Dravidian languages are grouped by various Dravidian linguists: See Subrahmanyam 1983, Zvelebil 1990, Krishnamurthi 2003). Tamil‚ÄìKannada itself is designated as a branch of the South Dravidian I subfamily and in turn branches off into Tamil‚ÄìKodagu and Kannada‚ÄìBadaga. The languages that constitute the Tamil‚ÄìKannada branch are Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Irula, Toda, Kota, Kodava, and Badaga. (Zvelebil 1990:56) According to R. C. Hiremath, Director of International School of Dravidian Linguistics in Trivandrum, the separation of Tamil and Kannada into independent languages from the Tamil‚ÄìKannada inner branch started with the separation of Tulu in about 1500 BCE and completed in about 300 BCE. Kannada, Tamil and Malayalam are recognized among the official languages of India and are spoken mainly in South India. All three are officially recognized as classical languages by the Government of India, along with Sanskrit, Telugu, and Odia.http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/odia-gets-classical-language- status/article5709028.ece ==Phonological features== Tamil and Malayalam have both retroflex lateral (/…≠/) and retroflex approximant (/…ª/) sounds, whereas Kannada has retained only the retroflex lateral. Evidence shows that both retroflex approximant and the retroflex laterals were once (before the 10th century) also present in Kannada. However, all the retroflex approximants changed into retroflex laterals in Kannada later. In Kannada, the bilabial voiceless plosive (/p/) at the beginning of many words has disappeared to produce a velar fricative (/h/) or has disappeared completely. This change is unique to Kannada in the Dravidian family. Tamil does not show this change. Tamil and Telugu show the conversion of velar plosives (/k/) into palatal plosives at the beginning of the words (refer to comparative method for details). Kannada, however, is totally inert to this change and hence the velar plosives are retained as such or with minimum changes in the corresponding words. ==References== *Krishnamurti, B., The Dravidian Languages, Cambridge University Press, 2003. *Subrahmanyam, P.S., Dravidian Comparative Phonology, Annamalai University, 1983. *Zvelebil, Kamil., Dravidian Linguistics: An Introduction\\", PILC (Pondicherry Institute of Linguistics and Culture), 1990 Category:Agglutinative languages Category:Dravidian languages Category:Languages of India ","title":"Tamil‚ÄìKannada languages"},{"id":"2232359","text":"Richard Gonzalez (born 24 May 1969), better known by his stage name Richard \\"Humpty\\" Vission, is a Canadian house music producer, remixer, and DJ. == Biography == He was raised in Highland Park, in Los Angeles, California.

It was the first time that the four original members of Kiss did not all appear together for the entire album. ==Album information== The album and the following tour were billed as the \\"Return of Kiss\\". Kiss had not released a studio album since Love Gun in 1977. Instead, the band released their second live album, Alive II, and each member had recorded eponymous solo albums, which were simultaneously released on September 18, 1978. After pre-production and rehearsals were completed, Vini Poncia (who had produced Peter Criss), decided that Criss' drumming was substandard, an opinion shared by Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons. Criss was hindered by injuries to his hands that he had suffered in a 1978 car accident. Kiss hired the South African-born studio drummer Anton Fig, who played on Ace Frehley, to play on the Dynasty sessions. \\"On Dynasty, Peter was pretty much out of commission through drugs and alcohol, and he was not being nice to most people. I wouldn't point to it as a classic Kiss album.\\"Kitts, Jeff: \\"Back in black (and white)\\", Guitar World, September 1996, p68 With the exception of his song \\"Dirty Livin' \\", a rewrite of a song of the same title demoed during his pre-Kiss days in Lips, Criss does not play drums on the album, and he did not perform on another Kiss album until Psycho Circus in 1998, on which he again only played on one song. Fig was again hired to replace Criss during recording sessions for the following album, Unmasked. Eric Carr was hired as Criss' permanent replacement before the Unmasked Tour began. Frehley, who himself left the band three years later, sings three songs on Dynasty: \\"Hard Times\\", \\"Save Your Love\\" and a cover version of the Rolling Stones' song \\"2000 Man\\". Although he had frequently sung backing vocals and had written the Kiss classics \\"Cold Gin\\" and \\"Parasite\\", Frehley had only previously been lead singer on his songs \\"Shock Me\\" on Love Gun, and \\"Rocket Ride\\" on the studio side of Alive II, as he lacked confidence in his ability as a lead singer. Stanley's \\"I Was Made for Lovin' You\\" was one of the band's most successful singles, peaking at #11 on the American singles chart. In eleven countries around the world it reached the #1 spot or 2nd position. He also sang on \\"Sure Know Something\\" and \\"Magic Touch\\". In contrast, Simmons sings lead vocals on only two songs, \\"Charisma\\" (which became a minor hit in Mexico) and \\"X-Ray Eyes\\". The album includes a colorful jacket cover which is actually a collage of photos taken from the photo session and not a group shot as it appears. The label shows a portrait of all four members instead of the usual Casablanca label. Inserts included a merchandise order form and a full- color poster. ==Tour== The Dynasty Tour ran in the second half of 1979 and was Kiss' most expensive. It was their first tour since the Alive II tour ended on April 2, 1978, in Japan. Kiss sported new costumes with colors that coincided with the colors of their respective solo albums: purple (Stanley), red (Simmons), blue (Frehley) and green (Criss). The new production had Simmons being hoisted to a small stage atop the scaffolding during his bass guitar solo (typically played before \\"God of Thunder\\"). The harness malfunctioned on several occasions. Frehley was similarly elevated for his guitar solo and the tour was the first to feature his \\"light-guitar\\" and his rocket-shooting stunt. A trick was designed for Stanley that involved him putting on a headset and shooting a laser out of his right eye (to mimic the effect seen in Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park a year before). After several run-throughs both Stanley and Bill Aucoin canceled the idea, citing the danger involved to both him and the fans. The tour saw a decline in audience. Shows at Madison Square Garden and the Pontiac Silverdome were canceled, while an additional night at the Los Angeles Forum was moved to the 10,000-capacity Anaheim Convention Center. The last concert with all the original members took place at the Toledo Sports Arena, in Toledo, Ohio, on December 16, 1979. The tour was considered a financial failure in the USA.

She was a member of the Chinese team that won the team competition at the 2006 World Championships and competed in the World Championships in Anaheim and was also a member of the 2004 Olympic Team. During her career, she was an uneven bars and balance beam specialist. Li Ya has two moves named after her in the Code of Points: the \\"Li Ya salto\\", which is a straddled Jaeger ¬Ω release (which she usually connected to a straddled Jaeger), and the \\"Li Ya dismount\\", which is an Arabian double-front in a piked position. Li retired from the national team in 2008. ==Biography== Li Ya is the 2004 National Champion on the uneven bars as well as the 2004 National All Around Silver Medalist. She had a great deal of success in the 2004 World Cup Circuit despite a bad showing at the 2004 Olympics. In the team final in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens she fell twice on beam scoring an 8.300 (once on her front flip and then underrotated on her double back dismount and put her hands down). Then in the event finals, she fell again on her front flip and scored a 9.050 (ranking 7th). She won the uneven bars title at the Glasgow and Ghent World Cup Qualifiers. She also won a bronze medal at the 2004 Glasgow World Cup Qualifier. In December 2004 Li Ya qualified to the World Cup Final in Birmingham. She was the most successful Chinese female gymnast at the World Cup Final. She won a bronze medal on the uneven bars and a silver medal on the balance beam. Li was briefly injured in 2005, but recovered in time to win silver medals at the 2005 Chinese National Championships and the 2005 Britain vs China Dual Meet on the uneven bars. In October, she competed at the National Games but did not win any medals. A few weeks later, she was part of China's winning team at the East Asia Games in Macau, where she also won a gold medal on the uneven bars. She was not selected for the 2005 World Championships in Melbourne. She competed in the 2006 Tournament of Masters in Cottbus, a world cup event, and won the gold medal on the uneven bars. In this event, she pioneered a difficult release-release combination, a Jaeger with a half turn directly into a Jaeger. The Jaegar with 1/2 turn release was later named for her. Li also qualified for the beam final and finished in fourth place, due to a mistake on her first skill. She competed at the 2006 World Championships in Aarhus, Denmark where she was a member of the Chinese team that won the gold medal in the women's team event. She did not compete in the team final, having withdrawn from the uneven bars due to nerves sustained from a performance marred by a fall in the preliminary competition. After this competition, Li Ya did not receive positive coverage from the press in China and was not named to the team for the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar. However, she had one more chance, having qualified for bars and beam in the World Cup Finals in Brazil, held in December. She hit her routines at this competition, winning silver on bars behind world champion Beth Tweddle, and winning gold on the balance beam. In 2007, Li Ya competed in the Maribor World Cup where she placed 2nd on balance beam and 1st on the uneven bars. She announced her retirement in 2008. ==Eponymous Skills== {  - !

The name Satria which means knight in Sanskrit was chosen for Proton's 3-door hatchback to reflect the sportiness of the car. == Satria (C96, C97, C98, C99; 1994‚Äì2006) == 1996-2005 Proton Satria (front) 1996-2005 Proton Satria (rear) The first generation Proton Satria, also marketed as the Proton Compact in the United Kingdom, and the Proton 300 Series in various European markets is a 3-door hatchback based on the fourth generation Mitsubishi Mirage / Colt. It was unveiled on 12 November 1994 as the result of a joint venture between Proton and Diversified Resources Bhd. (DRB), and was first imported to Europe during 1995. The Proton Satria was produced at Automotive Manufacturers Malaysia's (AMM) plant in Pekan, Pahang and was initially distributed by Usahasama Proton-DRB (USPD), a company in which Proton held a 30% stake in late 1994. In Australia, the Satira was launched in 1997 with 3 variants oringally on offered: 1.5 GL, 1.5 GLi and 1.6 XLi. All three variants was fuel injected. The car was featured as a regular prize on the Australian television games how Sale of the Century. The Proton Satria was initially available in three variants at launch with two engine options, namely the old 12-valve carburetted 1.3-litre 4G13P unit from the Proton Saga and a newer 16-valve multipoint fuel injected 1.6-litre 4G92P unit. The old 12-valve carburetted 1.5-litre 4G15P, also from the Proton Saga was added to the range later in the Satria's production cycle. The 1.5 and 1.6-litre engines were fitted with either a 3-speed or 4-speed automatic transmission, and a 5-speed manual transmission was offered with all three engine configurations. On the exterior, the Proton Satria shared the vast majority of its front-end styling and interior parts and components with the Proton Wira, but the rear-end was left largely unchanged over the Mirage / Colt it was based on. The Proton Satria had a development cost of RM150 million in late 1994, and it was priced between RM38,000 and RM54,000 at launch. Trim levels were LSi, GLi, GLSi and SEi. The base-specification LSi had the 1.3-litre 12-valve engine only: GLi versions got the 1.5-litre 12-valve engine in addition to the 1.3-litre: whilst GLSi and SEi versions got the 1.6 16v engine as well as the 1.5 12v. A later facelift version featured a redesigned rear end, different from that of the original Mirage. These were launched in 1996 in Malaysia and later in other countries, and new XLi, S XLi and GTi trim levels were available. New 1.3 12v, 1.5 12v, and 1.6 16v petrol engines were available. In 2004 in Malaysia, the Satria Special Edition was launched. Three variants were offered: 1.3 GL M/T, 1.5 GL M/T and 1.5 GL A/T. No mechanical change compared to regular Satria's. Rather changes were mostly cosmetic that included the headlights internal casing painted black, an addition of an engine cover, hollow race style headrests for the front seats, revised metre graphics, gunmetal finish for the dashboard centre cluster, aluminum pedal, and a yellow gear shifter base. === Satria GTi === 1998-2005 Proton Satria GTi (C99) The Proton Satria GTi was launched in 1998 with a 1.8-litre Mitsubishi-sourced 4G93P engine (\\"P\\" for Proton), originally found in the Mitsubishi Lancer GSR, but here without the turbo and with an increase in compression to compensate. The Satria GTi was developed and re-engineered as a traditional hot hatch by Lotus in Hethel, England. The Satria GTi could sprint from 0 to 60 mph in 8.5 seconds, making it among the fastest Proton production models ever produced. A new body kit was also adopted for better aerodynamics. The Satria GTi also wore a 'Handling by Lotus' badge on the rear hatch. The engine and handling of the Satria GTi were progressively updated and revised between 1998 and 2005. The Mitsubishi version was produced from 1998 until mid-2002. The VDO (Siemens) version had been in production from mid-2002 until 2005 when Proton ceased production. The Proton Satria GTi launched in the United Kingdom in November 1999 with a ¬£14,500 price tag. It was equipped with air-conditioning, ABS, dual front power windows, electric mirrors and Recaro seats. Proton sold 160 units of the Satria GTi within its first six months in the U.K. Richard Hammond had reviewed the Proton Satria GTi alongside the more established Peugeot 206 GTi. The Satria GTi received more praise and approval as a traditional hot hatch, despite costing ¬£500 more than the 206 GTi. ===Cabriolet=== A concept Proton Cabriolet was shown at the 1997 Frankfurt International Motor Show, with ambitions for sales in the UK from 1999 but this did not happen. === Satria R3 === The Proton Satria R3 is a limited edition Satria sold in Malaysia. It was officially soft-launched on 4 October 2004, then made available for booking on 17 October 2004. The term R3 stands for Race, Rally, Research. R3 is a redefined version of the Satria GTi by Proton's Racing development team in collaboration with Lotus. It houses the same 1800 cc Mitsubishi 4G93P engine but has undergone some minor adjustments by Lotus handling. The body shell has been improved with double stitch welded monocoque chassis with front and rear strut tower brace bars. Body weight has been lightened as well. It comes with Recaro SR4 semi-bucket seats, both Momo steering wheel and gear knob. == Satria Neo (BS3, BS6; 2006‚Äì2015) == 2007-2009 Proton Satria Neo GX in Australia. The Proton Satria Neo was introduced in June 2006 as a replacement for the first generation Satria. Based on a new platform developed in-house by Proton (with some parts borrowed from the bigger Gen-2 and Waja), the car is currently only available in a three-door hatchback guise. The car was developed at a cost of RM500 million and four years, and was expected by Proton to generate a monthly sales volume of 2,000 - 2,500 units. The car was also intended to target those who are \\"youthful and sporty\\". The Satria Neo was launched by former Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. The Satria Neo is also the only Proton car to be sold in Japan. The entry-level Satria Neo, the 1.3 B-line, is powered by a 1.3-litre, inline-four twin-cam Campro engine, producing at 6,000 rpm and 120 Nm of torque at 4,000 rpm. The 1.6 M-line and top-of-the-range H-line models have 1.6 litre versions of the same engine, with an output of at 6,000 rpm and 148 Nm of torque at 4,000 rpm. Both the M-line and H-line models have active system antennae which actively search for signals in areas with poor reception. All cars have the option of either 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic gearboxes supplied by Mitsubishi that are carried over from the previous Satria, with the H-line benefiting from safety features such as twin airbags, ABS with EBD and seatbelt pre-tensioners. All versions of the car come with an integrated Blaupunkt CD player. === Proton Satria Neo CPS === 2011 Proton Satria Neo CPS H-Line. In February 2009, Proton launched a CPS version of the Satria Neo, replacing the high-end H-Line version of the Satria Neo. It comes with an aggressively styled body kit and spoiler that pays homage to the Satria GTi. It is powered by a 1.6-litre CamPro CPS engine with and of torque which reportedly does not suffer from the torque dip of older CamPro engines; however, the timing of the cam profile switching mechanism is slightly modified for aggressive driving ‚Äì the CPS mechanism in the Satria Neo CPS changes from low cam to high cam at 4,400 rpm rather than at 3,800 rpm as in the other CPS-equipped models such as the Proton Waja and Proton Gen-2, as well as the Proton Exora. ;Specifications (CPS) {  - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Powertrain Engine & Performance -  Engine  CamPro CPS 4 cylinder, DOHC 16V -  Maximum Speed (km/h)  210 km/h -  Acceleration 0‚Äì100 km/h (sec)  10.5 -  Maximum Output hp(kW)/rpm  at 6,500 rpm -  Maximum Torque (Nm/rpm)  150 Nm at 4,500 rpm -  Full tank capacity (Litre)  50 -  Tyres & Rims  195 / 50 R16\\", Alloy-18\\" x 6.5JJ - ! align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"2\\"  Chassis -  Power Steering  Hydraulic Power Steering -  Suspension (Front/Rear)  MacPherson Strut with Stabiliser Bar/ Multi-link with Stabiliser Bar -  Brake (Front/Rear)  Ventilated disc/ Solid Disc } === Proton Satria Neo R3 === The 2008 model of Proton Satria R3 on display at the 2008 Melbourne Motor Show. As a successor to the original Satria R3, Proton introduced a high performance version of the Satria Neo in 2008. It features a naturally aspired 1.6-litre engine producing or , which Proton says will deliver a \\"controlled yet exciting driving experience\\". Other upgrades include a sportier bodykit, 17-inch wheels, a lowered suspension setup derived from Lotus, an improved braking system, Recaro lightweight seats and a MOMO steering wheel. All of the 50 examples produced come in Incognito Black with a unique \\"Race, Rally Research\\" decal on the side. Proton Satria Neo R3 Lotus Racing The 25 unit-only Satria Neo R3 Lotus Racing was introduced on the 30 March 2010. Sold at RM115,000 this special version of the Neo features some improvements over its sibling, the Satria Neo CPS. The look is similar to that of the Satria Neo R3, but includes some exclusive equipment. The engine is R3-tuned with R3 Engine Management System, R3 Camshafts with adjustable alloy cams and R3 tuned exhaust system. R3 Division also used an R3 Carbon Fibre Air Intake with K&N; Air Filter System. The engine now produces , approximately 13.8 percent more power than a normal CamPro CPS. with an improved torque of . Top speed reaches and the century run is achieved in 12.2 seconds. The gear ratios were also revised to match the engine upgrade. The chassis and handling were improved with the use of Ohlins Adjustable coilovers. The wheels are 16-inch Advantis with Bridgestone Adrenalin tyres. The brakes are from AP Racing consisting of AP Racing calipers and pads. Interior-wise, the dash remains the same but it is now painted in a greenish accent to match Lotus' green Trademark. Few enhancements were put in place such as the engine start button, dark green Nappa leather and an alloy pedal set and gear knob. 2011 Proton Satria Neo R3 In continuation of the legacy of the Satria Neo R3 Lotus Racing, Proton introduced the 2011 R3 Satria Neo on 8 February 2011.2011 Proton R3 Satria Neo Officially Launched In Malaysia LIVE LIFE DRIVE. Available only in bright red, it costed RM79,797.00 and featured a built-in 2-DIN navigation system, the first in Proton's history. It was fitted with the old Satria Neo CPS bodykit mated to new R3 Design 16-inch alloy rims, R3 front and rear spoilers and side mouldings in addition to leather upholstery and various other R3 extras on the interior. Its handling and performance attributes remained unchanged over its Lotus Racing sibling. Prior to its launch, the concept model for the 2011 Proton Satria Neo R3 was debuted during the Tokyo Auto Salon 2011. 2013 Proton Satria Neo R3 2013-2015 Proton Satria Neo R3 Proton launched the 2013 Satria Neo R3 on 29 November 2012. It is technically identical performance-wise to the Satria Neo CPS, but features the 2011 Satria Neo R3 bodykit and a significantly reduced price tag, costing between RM60,800 and RM64,250. The roof of the 2013 Satria Neo R3 is painted according to the body colour. This differentiates it from the 2011 Satria Neo R3 which had a black roof. Optional decals and performance equipment such as ECU upgrades and full exhaust systems were also made available by Proton. The 2013 Satria Neo R3 is fitted with dual airbags, ABS with EBD and is offered in manual and auto transmissions with a choice of 3 colours. === Proton Satria Neo Super 2000 Rally Car=== Proton Satria Neo Super 2000 Rally Car. Proton Motorsports' British based partner Mellors Elliot Motorsports (MEM) has prepared a FIA Super 2000 compliant Proton Satria Neo based on the road car's chassis. It is powered by the same engine as found in the Proton Waja 1.8. The team's current drivers in 2011 on the Intercontinental Rally Challenge (IRC), starting with the Rally Monte Carlo is Chris Atkinson. He will contest on all six rounds of the 2011 Asia Pacific Rally Championship (APRC) and Per-Gunnar Andersson who drives the second car for the Proton team in the IRC events, while Alister McRae will continue to drive for Proton in the APRC. McRae took the car to its first drivers and constructors titles in the 2011 APRC. A pair of Proton Satria Neo S2000s were used in an episode of Top Gear, in a race between the British presenters and their Australian counterparts at Cornbury Park, a former Rally GB venue. ===Proton Satria Neo CUSCO Edition=== Proton Satria Neo CUSCO Edition. Proton made its presence felt for the very first time in Japan when renowned Japanese automotive parts manufacturer Carrosser Co., Ltd. (CUSCO) officially unveiled at the Tokyo Auto Salon, a specially-developed Satria Neo rally car that will be sold in Japan. In January 2011, Proton announced that Japanese auto parts company CUSCO would be buying standard road-going Satria Neo body shells to engineer and homologate according to FIA Group N regulation competition use. The Group N Proton Satria Neo rally cars will be based on stock standard road-registered 1600cc showroom models acquired by CUSCO, homologated according to FIA regulations for competition use, and retrofitted with CUSCO-developed aftermarket performance and race components. With the Satria Neo, CUSCO is essentially Proton's customer ‚Äì they buy the body shells, equip them with CUSCO-developed race components, and then sell the completed Group N rally-going Neos to customers who will compete in Junior Rally Championships in Japan and Asia Pacific. Veteran Malaysian rally driver, Karamjit Singh piloted a CUSCO-tuned Proton Satria Neo 2WD in which he crossed the line to finish first in the overall 2011 APRC 2WD category on May 2011 Rally of Queensland as well as first in the N2 category. Three Satria Neos were fielded in the 2011 Japan Rally Championship in JN-3, one unit for the CUSCO Team and two for the CUSCO Junior Rally Team respectively. The latter finished with a class win in Rally Hokkaido 2011. In the 2012 season, only the Junior Rally Team drove the Satria Neos, whereas the CUSCO Team had replaced their unit with a Toyota 86. == References  External links == *Proton Satria Neo R3 Satria Category:Hot hatches Category:Cars introduced in 1995 Category:2000s cars Category:2010s cars ","title":"Proton Satria"},{"id":"2232393","text":"The Great Western Railway (GWR) 4300 Class is a class of 2-6-0 (mogul) steam locomotives, designed by G.J. Churchward for mixed traffic duties. 342 were built from 1911‚Äì1932. ==Background== In 1906 Churchward fitted a more powerful Standard No. 4 boiler to his successful 3100 Class 2-6-2T to create the GWR 3150 Class. These showed themselves to be successful locomotives but their weight and water capacity meant that they tended to be restricted to suburban passenger traffic. Churchward was looking forward to the replacement of various of his predecessor‚Äôs 4-4-0 classes on secondary duties. In 1911 he therefore designed a tender version of the 3150 class which would be suitable for a wide range of intermediate duties. ==Design== The class was ‚Äòa total synthesis of standard parts, using the outside cylinders of the Saint, the wheels of ‚Äô31XX‚Äô 2-6-2 tank and the No. 4 boiler, in its superheated form.‚ÄôNock (1983 p. 169 No prototype was required as the fundamental design had proved itself. ==Production series== The locomotives quickly proved themselves to be so useful that they were produced more or less continuously in a series of batches (or lots) over a twelve year period (1911‚Äì1923), sometimes incorporating detailed differences. Two further lots were built in 1925 and 1932 by Churchward's successor, Charles Collett.Production details from ===Lot 183=== The first twenty examples, numbered 4301-20, were delivered by Swindon Works between June and October 1911. These had inside steam pipes, and were among the first GWR locomotives to be fitted with top feed apparatus.Le Fleming (1962), pp. J5 and J13. Nos. 4311‚Äì20 had boilers designed to operate at pressure but only 4315 and possibly 4316 ever worked at that pressure.Le Fleming (1962), pp. J5 and J13. ===Lots 193, 194 and 198=== Three further batches, totalling a further forty locomotives (4321‚Äì4360) were built at Swindon and delivered June 1913 and May 1914, before the onset of the First World War impeded further production. These locomotives (and all subsequent examples had frames lengthened by at the rear to give better access for maintenance as well as providing more room in the cab. ===Lots 202 and 204-208=== The class proved to be ‚Äòjust the type that was needed during the 1914‚Äì18 war and were accordingly built in considerable numbers during that period.‚ÄôLe Fleming (1962), p.

Six batches, totalling one hundred locomotives (numbered 4361‚Äì4399, 4300, 5300‚Äì5359) were built between May 1915 and September 1918, and a further ten (5360‚Äì5369) between January and June 1919. From 1917 detailed changes were made to the design giving better weight distribution between the wheels which were later applied to other members of the classLe Fleming (1962), p. J13. Eleven examples of the class were transported to France during World War I in the service of the Railway Operating Division of the British Army and these were 5319‚Äì5326 and 5328‚Äì5330. One survives in preservation. ===Lots 209, 211-212, 216, 230=== The first three of these lots were for seventy locomotives built between June 1919 and July 1921 (Nos. 5370-99 and 6300-6341). Lot 216 was for a further 28 locomotives (6342‚Äì6369) but Swindon works was then unable to keep pace with the demand for them and only the first twenty were completed after delay, between March and December 1923. The remainder (6362-9 and 7320/1) were later built under lot 230 in 1925.Le Fleming (1962), p. J13. 6320 was converted to oil firing between 1947 and the equipment was removed in 1949. ===Lots 218 and 222=== As Swindon works could not keep pace an order was placed with Robert Stephenson and Company in 1921 for fifty locomotives (Nos. 6370‚Äì6399 and 7300‚Äì7319). The first 35 of these (Lot 218) were built by the company between April 1921 and January 1922. The remaining fifteen were built at Swindon from parts manufactured by RSH between November 1921 and January 1922. In 1925 Nos. 7300‚Äì7304 were modified for better balance and had detail alterations. ===Lot 276=== In 1932, Collett built a further twenty examples (9300‚Äì9319) to a modified design with side window cabs, outside steam pipes and a screw reverse. He also extended the frames, increasing the weight to (), which placed them in the Red band of route availability. After passing into British Railways ownership, these locomotives were modified back to light buffer beam design and were renumbered 7322‚Äì7341 between 1956 and 1959. ==8300 Class== No. 5327 at Swindon 11 June 1950 (modified to the heavier version as No. 8327 1928‚Äì1944). The class were widely used in Devon and Cornwall where the track had many sharp curves. It was found that flange wear on the leading driving wheels became excessive as a result of these bends. In November and December 1927 additional weight was added to the front end of four examples so that the pony truck would be forced to impart more side thrust to the main frames on bends. These locomotives reverted to their original state, but between January and March 1928, 65 engines of 5300 series received additional weight on the pony truck, and 3000 was added to their running numbers, temporarily creating an ‚Äò8300 Class‚Äô. However, the additional weight placed them in the Red category of route availability. From 1944 onwards there was a shortage of locomotives in the Blue category and so the additional weights were removed and the surviving locomotives resumed their original running numbers. The last to be returned to its original condition was 8393 in September 1948. Le Fleming (1962), p. J14. ==Use== The 4300 Moguls were the maids of all work on the GWR network and later the Western Region of British Railways. Employing a Standard number 4 boiler and the support struts similar to those fitted to the '2800' class, the class very quickly earned an excellent reputation in its ability to handle most types of traffic, from local stopping goods to main line expresses. According to O.S. Nock they \\"could handle the heavy goods work as well as the 'Aberdares' and could run up to 70 mph with passenger trains, in other words they were the ideal mixed traffic locomotive\\".Nock (1983) p. 169 ==Withdrawal== 5322 preserved in WWI Railway Operating Division khaki livery Although the class continued to be very useful and the final batch were still relatively new, 100 of the earlier examples were withdrawn between 1936 and 1939 and the wheels and motion of eighty were used for the Grange Class and twenty for Manor Class engines. It was intended to replace the whole class in this way but the advent of the Second World War in 1939 brought a temporary halt to withdrawals and the programme was never revived. Le Fleming (1962), p. J14. Further withdrawals resumed in 1948 under British Railways ownership, but the last six examples survived until 1964. ==Accidents and incidents== : *On 13 October 1928, locomotive No. 6381 was hauling a freight train that was run into by a passenger train at , Gloucestershire due to the driver of the passenger train overrunning signals. Sixteen people were killed and 41 were injured. *On 1 March 1937, a 4300 Class locomotive hauling a freight train that was in collision with a passenger train at , Buckinghamshire. One person was killed and six were injured. *On 7 September 1945, locomotive No. 6315 was hauling a mail and freight train that was derailed near , Denbighshire due to the trackbed being washed away following the failure of the bank of the Shropshire Union Canal. One person was killed and two were injured. The train's consist, except for a brake van, was destroyed in the ensuing fire. *In 1952, locomotive No. 7311 overran a signal and was derailed by trap points at , Oxfordshire. *On 6 September 1956, locomotive No. 9306 was hauling a parcels train that overran signals and ran into the rear of an express passenger train at , Shropshire. ==Preservation== Only two examples have survived to preservation: Note: Loco numbers in bold mean their current number. {  !colspan=2 Number !rowspan=2 Builder !rowspan=2 Built !rowspan=2 Withdrawn !rowspan=2 Location !rowspan=2 Current status !rowspan=2 Image !rowspan=2 Notes - !Original !Later - align=center5322 align=center8322 align=centerSwindon Works align=centerAug 1917 align=centerApr 1964 align=centerDidcot Railway Centre align=leftOn static display align=center150px align=leftOne of 11 locos exported to France in World War I.

It was sent, with several other members of the class, to France for hauling munitions and hospital trains. There it was painted in War Department livery and given the number ROD5322. Demobbed in 1919 at Chester it returned to the GWR fleet until it was withdrawn from service in April 1964. It was sent to Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, South Wales. The first Barry locomotive to be subject to a preservation fund, it was the second locomotive to leave Woodham's: 5322 thus ended up as the sole early 43xx to be preserved. It was initially restored to working order, but was not steamed after 1975 until returning to steam in 2008 at the Didcot Railway Centre, restored to its 1919 War Department condition. 9303 is one of the final batch of 342 locomotives built between 1911 and 1932. They were built with larger cabs and had a weight attached to the buffer beam to place more weight on the leading pony wheels. This was done to reduce the wear on the leading driving wheels. In 1958 the weight was removed from the buffer beam to give the locomotive more route availability. At the same time it was renumbered 7325. An engine similar to the 4300 class was rebuilt from 5193 (a GWR 5101 Class 2-6-2T) to become a smaller boilered version of the class numbered 9351. ==References== ;Sources * == External links == * Great Western archive page * Railuk database * 5322 Didcot page * 9303 SVR page 4300 Class Category:2-6-0 locomotives Category:Robert Stephenson and Company locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1911 Category:Railway Operating Division locomotives Category:Standard gauge steam locomotives of Great Britain ","title":"GWR 4300 Class"},{"id":"2232396","text":"Jamie Principle (born 5 July 1960) is an American house music artist and producer born in Chicago, Illinois.[ allmusic ((( Jamie Principle > Biography )))] ==Biography== Jamie Principle was a pioneer of house music when the genre began in Chicago in the early 1980s. \\"Jamie Principle got us all into the music,\\" Marshall Jefferson told i-D in 1986. \\"He was the first one to record house and get played by Frankie Knuckles, but by the time he got a record out (over three years ago) everyone had ripped off all his ideas and were tired of his songs.

Nose rider Noseriding is one of the most accomplished maneuvers in surfing. Some advanced maneuvers include: Hang ten toes, Hang five toes, Stretch-five, Front Foot/heel hang, Back Foot/heel hang. Noseriding is a functional maneuver best performed on waves around head high or less in size. Noseriding is performed mainly on noserider style surfboards, which are generally or more in length, with larger surface area and higher water displacement to provide a more stable walking surface. ==Background== \\"Noseriding wasn't identified as a maneuver unto itself until the early 1950s, after the surfboard fin had grown big enough to really anchor the tail.\\" wrote Matt Warshaw in . According to most surfing historians, the fin was invented by Tom Blake around 1935, for the purpose of anchoring the tail and giving the surfboard direction from the tail to the tip. The fin enabled skilled surfers to walk to the front of the board without the tail skipping out from the wave. In 1947, Joe Quigg recorded, in drawings and words, the noseriding skill of Rabbit Kekai on waves at \\"Outer Queens\\" near Waikiki, Hawaii. One of the first commercial surfboard manufacturers, Dale Vezy is credited as being the first to get to the nose to hang five and hang ten in the early 1950s. Noseriding is widely considered the origin of \\"Extreme\\" surfing and had become such a popular trick by the late 1950s that Surfer Magazine publisher John Severson devoted a regular feature, called \\"Toes on the Nose\\", starting with his debut issue of Surfer in 1960. Noseriding defined the surfers of the 1950s led by Rabbit Kekai, then Matt Kivlin and Joe Quigg. Then came the champion surfers of the 60s including Lance Carson , Phil Edwards , Dewey Weber , Mickey Mu√±oz , Joey Cabell , Donald Takayama, Skip Frye , David Nuuhiwa , Gary Proper , Claude Codgen and Bob Purvey .

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, surfboard designers experimented with a variety of components to make the nose hold up longer and noserider surfboard designs became the hot sellers throughout the 60s. The combinations of template (outline shape), thickness, weight, rocker, rail shape, concaves, convexs, flats and fins vary with the individual surfer's style and size, and continue to be an experiment. To this day, noserider designs continue to be refined. So far the knowledge bank has established certain principles: Concave under the nose creates an air pocket that helps the nose stay up longer; complementing the concave nose is a kicked up tail that would catch water to keep the tail down. While an accomplished surfer can nose ride a narrow shortboard nose, a wide nose (about wide) is considered a better platform for stability and lift. Rail shape can significantly affect the maneuverability from the nose. Rail shapes vary from turned up rails, which are found in most of today's noseriders, to turned down rails. Turned-up rails allow the board to turn easier from the tip, while the turned-down rail forces the board to stay in a trim and limits the turning ability from the tip. Of course, placement of the turned up or turned down rail is important. Turned up rails work best around the nose, while turned down rails work best around the tail. How much turn- down or turn up is measured in percnetages, i.e., 70/30 means 70% down and 30% up. Lighter board weights enable the board to stay higher on the water, so it can travel faster and allow the board to respond quicker and a lighter board allows for a thinner board. Single fins are preferred, albeit, fin configurations have a wide open frontier, as are weights and thickness. Noseriding is achieved mostly when the surfer positions them-self and the board where the wave is formed into the most vertical wall, just before the wave breaks. Point Break waves are ideal for noseriding because the wave travels from the point to the cove and gives the surfer a long ride where a \\"hook\\" is formed with the most vertical wall that travels down the line, like a zipper, from one end to the other. Immediately after the hook is the white water, where the wave implodes. It is best to avoid the white water but with a noserider surfboard, an accomplished surfer can ride through or maneuver around the imploding wave while remaining on the nose. One of the most difficult noseriding maneuvers is to get tubed while on the tip. It is not impossible to stay on the nose while out on the flat shoulder of the wave either. A noserider surfboard with a deep concave can carry a surfer on a wave that does not have a steep wall. Be prepared to back off the nose in this flat area of the wave because it has the least air traveling under the nose, so riding onto the flat of the wave while on the nose could cause the nose to suddenly dip into the water under the full weight of the surfer. In 1965, Tom Morey (inventor of the \\"Morey-Boogie\\": body board) devised the first professional surf contest around timing nose rides. The \\"nose\\" area was defined as the front 25% of the board. While success at this subgenre is grossly measured in proximity to the tip of the board and time spent there, the acknowledged stylists move forward and backward fluidly on the board by cross-stepping or \\"walking\\" foot-over-foot and/or shuffling with poise and economy of movement, resolving changes in upward pressure with subtle adjustments to their center of gravity using knees, waist and hips (upper bodies ever quiet) and position on the board; never the arms waving. == See also == * Glossary of surfing ==References== Category:Surfing Category:Surfing terminology ","title":"Nose ride"},{"id":"2232459","text":"Cupressus bakeri, reclassified as Hesperocyparis bakeri,Jepson eFlora (JM2): Hesperocyparis bakeri . accessed 8.28.2015.CalFlora Database: Hesperocyparis bakeri . accessed 8.28.2015. with the common names Baker cypress, Modoc cypress, or Siskiyou cypress, is a rare species of cypress tree endemic to a small area across far northern California and extreme southwestern Oregon, in the western United States. ==Distribution== The tree grows in a small section of northern California within Siskiyou, Modoc, Shasta, Plumas and Tehama Counties; and very localized in southwestern Oregon in Josephine and Jackson Counties.United States Department of Agriculture plants profile It is usually found in small, scattered populations, not in large forests, at altitudes of .

Tube feet (more technically called podia) are small active tubular projections on the oral face of an echinoderm, whether the arms of a starfish, or the undersides of sea urchins, sand dollars and sea cucumbers; they are more discreet though present on brittlestars, and have only a feeding function in feather stars. They are part of the water vascular system. ==Structure and function== Tube feet function in locomotion, feeding, and respiration. The tube feet in a starfish are arranged in grooves along the arms. They operate through hydraulic pressure. They are used to pass food to the oral mouth at the center, and can attach to surfaces. A starfish that is overturned simply turns one arm over and attaches it to a solid surface, and levers itself the right way up. Tube feet allow these different types of animals to stick to the ocean floor and move slowly. Each tube foot consists of two parts: the ampulla and the podium. The ampulla is a water-filled sac contained in the body of the animal that contains both circular muscles and longitudinal muscle. The podia is the tube-shaped structure that protrudes out from the body and contains longitudinal muscle only. When the muscles around the ampulla contract, they squeeze water from the ampulla into the connected podium, causing the podium to elongate. When the muscles around the podium contract, they squeeze the water back into the ampulla, causing the podium to contract. The podia use a chemical adhesive (no suction) to attach to the substratum.

It evolved throughout the sport's formative early years as a contrary response to the highly regimented style of ski competition prevalent at the time. Snowboarders primarily refer to freeriding as backcountry, sidecountry, or off-piste snowboarding, and sometimes big mountain or extreme riding. Freeriding incorporates various aspects of snowboarding into a style that adapts to the variations and challenges of natural, off-piste terrain, and eschews man-made features such as jumps, rails, half-pipes, or groomed snow. To master freeriding is to seamlessly merge these aspects of other snowboarding disciplines such as freestyle and alpine snowboarding into an all-around style - giving you the freedom to make the most of whatever terrain comes your way. Whereas freestyle snowboarding relies on the use of man-made terrain such as jumps, rails and half-pipes, and alpine snowboarding is done on groomed snow, freeriding utilizes the random flow of natural terrain to perform similar tricks. Due to their use of backcountry routes, freeriders are (proportionally) much more likely to become a victim of avalanches. One estimate considers that about 80% of all avalanche deaths in the Alps occur among freeride/backcountry riders. While the term ‚Äúfreeriding‚Äù originated in snowboarding, some skiers have adopted it in recent years. For many years, the skiing equivalent of freeriding was known as freeskiing and referred specifically to off-piste skiing. However over the years, especially since the arrival of snowboarding, the term \\"freeskiing\\" has come to refer to freestyle skiing. This has left traditional ‚Äúfreeskiers‚Äù without a name for their style of skiing, and so some now use the snowboarding term instead. This became somewhat official in 2013, when the ‚ÄúFreeride World Tour‚Äù absorbed the ‚ÄúFreeskiing World Tour‚Äù into its schedule of competitive events. ==Equipment== Freeride snowboards make up a large part of the market as they are the ideal choice for the all-rounder. A freeride board usually has a directional shape and flex pattern with a nose that is softer than the tail - this helps with turn initiation and with handling cruddy/choppy snow conditions. Overall a freeride board is stiffer tip to tail and edge to edge for a more precise and stable ride. Boots and bindings are usually stiffer than their freestyle snowboarding counterparts as well. Some freeride boards are designed more specifically for powder than for groomers. Many powder boards are tapered, which means they have a narrower tail than nose. Some have rocker, which means instead of camber these boards have their lowest point between your bindings and they bend up towards the tips. Some powder boards have a swallow tail design which allows the tail to sink easier which in turn keeps the nose up and some have pintails which make the board faster edge to edge in deep snow. ==Personalities== Craig Kelly (April 1, 1966 - January 20, 2003) is known as the 'Godfather of Freeriding'; Terje Haakonsen called Kelly the best snowboarder of all time. He shocked the snowboard industry by walking away from multimillion-dollar deals to pursue freeriding. The distinctive fluid manner in which he rode was recognized and acclaimed in the snowboarding community. He was called a \\"style master\\" by snowboard magazine editor Jon Foster. Kelly appeared in many video and photo shoots. He was known for looking straight at the camera, even in the midst of a difficult aerial maneuver. Kelly was a Sims Snowboards team rider for a few years early in his career, but spent most of his life riding for Burton Snowboards. He was responsible for the design and development of many snowboards for the Burton Snowboards brand. The company's founder, Jake Burton, is quoted as saying, ‚ÄúWhen I started listening to Craig, that was when my company became successful and really took off.‚Äù He added, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ when the rest of the industry listened to Craig, that was when the sport really took off.‚Äù Craig Kelly died on January 20, 2003 near Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada in an avalanche which trapped 8 people and killed 6 others. Jacques Russo's film documentary, \\"Let It Ride\\", celebrates Craig Kelly's life. Johan Olofsson (born October 27, 1976) is a snowboarder known for being one of the first riders to take freestyle tricks more commonly performed in man-made terrain parks into the big mountain freeriding environments of Alaska. Originally coming from a freestyle background, Olofsson adapted his spin tricks and jibs to the backcountry environment. He gained attention and respect from the freeriding community when he started performing these tricks off natural features such as windlips and cliffs in the midst of steep lines in the Alaskan ranges. Jeremy Jones (born 14 January 1975) is a former snowboard racer now regarded as a pioneer of professional big mountain riding. His style is a seminal influence on modern big mountain freeriding. Travis Rice (born October 9, 1982) is regarded as the ‚ÄúPaul Revere‚Äù of the big mountain freestyle movement. Best known for his success in the realm of freestyle snowboarding competition, his ability to adapt his skills to extreme terrain has gained him legendary status in backcountry circles as well. ==Competition== Freeride competitions basically involve negotiating steep natural terrain fluidly in a similar approach to slopestyle competitors in a terrain park. However unlike the freestyle discipline of slopestyle, there are no perfect man-made takeoffs or landings - each individual rider's route varies, and is personally plotted out in pre-run inspections. Constantly changing weather and snow conditions add an extra element to these events, and the unpredictably random aspect of freeride terrain contributes to a high risk of personal injury. The Freeride World Tour is an annually toured series of events in which the world's best freeriders compete for individual event wins, as well as the overall title of World Champion in their respective genders and disciplines. The first event series under the Freeride World Tour moniker took place in 2008. Prior to that it was known as the Verbier Extreme, originally a snowboard only contest launched in 1996 - with skiers also invited to compete in 2004. For the 2013 season, the Freeride World Tour merged with the Freeskiing World Tour and The North Face Masters of Snowboarding, combining all three tours under one unified global championship series. From 1995-2001 New Zealand's World Heli Challenge invited international extreme snowboarders and skiers to compete in New Zealand's Mt. Cook National Park. The helicopter-accessed competition occurred over a two- week period to allow for weather and snow conditions. In 2001, the tragedy of the 9/11 terrorist attacks interrupted international sponsorship support leading to an eight-year break. Footage from the previous years events continued to play worldwide. In 2009 the World Heli Challenge resumed and has been running annually ever since. ==References== Category:Snowboarding Category:Freestyle skiing ","title":"Freeriding (sport)"},{"id":"2232473","text":"Tazarotene (marketed as Tazorac, Avage, Zorac, and Fabior) is a third- generation prescription topical retinoid sold as a cream, gel, or foam. Tazarotene is a member of the acetylenic class of retinoids. This medication is approved for treatment of psoriasis, acne, and sun damaged skin (photodamage). It is commonly sold in two concentrations: 0.05% and 0.1%. ==Mechanism of action== Tazarotene is a retinoid prodrug which is converted to its active form, the cognate carboxylic acid of tazarotene, by rapid deesterification in animals and humans. Tazarotenic acid binds to all three members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RARŒ±, RARŒ≤, and RARŒ≥ but shows relative selectivity for RARŒ≤, and RARŒ≥ and may modify gene expression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. ==Side effects== Common side effects include worsening of acne, increased sensitivity to sunlight, dry skin, itchiness, redness and in some cases extreme drying and cracking of skin. For most patients these side effects are uncomfortable but mild and decrease markedly after the first 2‚Äì4 weeks of use except for increased sensitivity to sunlight. For best results dermatologists recommend applying the cream or gel once daily before bedtime after washing the face with a mild cleanser. Dermatologists recommend using a moisturizer so that skin will not be as dry and flaky. ==Uses== Tazarotene is most commonly used topically to treat acne, psoriasis (a skin disease in which red, scaly patches form on some areas of the body), and to reduce skin wrinkling and liver spots. Tazarotene is rated pregnancy category X, and should not be used by pregnant women. \\"There is limited evidence that tazarotene and isotretinoin benefit patients with moderate photodamage on the face: both are associated with skin irritation and erythema.\\" In addition to tretinoin, which has been associated with greater skin improvements with high concentrations, tazarotene and isotretinoin creams are also found to be effective for photodamage, but at the expense of skin irritation. More evidence is needed before any recommendations can be made on oral or topical polysaccharides or hydroxy acids. Evidence from one trial suggests that the effectiveness of 0.05% tretinoin, is equivalent to the effects of 0.05% and 0.1% tazarotene. However, for acne vulgaris, several recent double blind studies have shown consistently superior efficacy for tazarotene and roughly equal tolerability for both treatments. \\"Specifically, tazarotene reduced the number of noninflammatory and inflammatory lesions at 4, 8, and 12 weeks -- all timepoints examined during treatment. Although the reduction of inflammatory lesions compared with tretinoin did not achieve statistical significance, the reduction of open comedones at 12 weeks was 65% for tazarotene vs 44% for tretinoin (P = .034). Tazarotene also proved superior in the reduction of noninflammatory lesions at 12 weeks (55% vs 42% for tretinoin, P = .042).\\" ==Synthesis== Acetylenic retinoid prodrug converted to the active metabolite, tazarotenic acid, with selective affinity for retinoic acid receptors RARŒ≤ and RARŒ≥. Tazarotene synthesis:Prepn: Chandraratna RA, ; idem, (1988, 1992 both to Allergan). The formation of the ring system involves first alkylation of the anion from thiophenol with dimethylallyl bromide (1) to give the thioether (2). Friedel-Crafts cyclization of the olefin with the equivalent of PPA then gives the thiopyran (3). Acylation with acetyl chloride in the presence of aluminium chloride gives the methyl ketone (4). Reaction of the enolate of that ketone with diethyl chlorophosphate gives the enol phosphate 5 as a transient intermediate. This eliminates diethyl phosphite in the presence of excess base to give the corresponding acetylene 6. The anion from the reaction of the acetylene with base is then used to displace chlorine from Ethyl 6-chloronicotinate (7). This reaction affords the coupling product tazarotene (8). ==Notes== Category:Retinoids Category:Phenylacetylenes Category:Nicotinates Category:Anti-acne preparations Category:Antipsoriatics Category:Ethyl esters ","title":"Tazarotene"},{"id":"2232474","text":"is a Japanese author known for his horror novels.

He is noted for the characters he created with paradoxical and grotesque characteristics: Professor Kranz, the ultra-timid Giandomenico Fracchia, and the obsequious and meek accountant Ugo Fantozzi, perhaps the favourite character in Italian comedy. He wrote several books, usually of satirical character. He also acted in dramatic roles, and appeared in several movies. ==Early life== Paolo Villaggio was born in Genova, to Ettore Villaggio (1905‚Äì1992), a surveyor originally from Palermo, and Maria, originally from Venice, a German-language teacher. Paolo had a twin brother, Piero, who taught at the University of Pisa. From there, Villaggio was hired for the TV programme Quelli della domenica (The Sunday guys), in which Fantozzi made his first appearance, introduced his characters, the aggressive \\"Professor Kranz\\" and the hypocritical \\"Giandomenico Fracchia\\". ==Career== Villaggio as Fantozzi ===Awards=== He has received several cinema awards, including the David di Donatello (1990), the Nastro d'Argento (1992) and the Golden Lion for his entire career (1992). ===Fantozzi=== After his television experience, Villaggio started writing, for the magazines L'Espresso and L'Europeo, short stories featuring accountant Ugo Fantozzi, a man with a weak character, dogged by misfortune and by the \\"mega-director\\" of the \\"mega- company\\" where he works. In 1971, the publishing house Rizzoli released the book Fantozzi, a collection of these stories, which sold over a million copies, followed soon by the sequel Il secondo tragico libro di Fantozzi. The first book received the Gogol Prize in Moscow and led to his 1975 appearance in the film Fantozzi, directed by Luciano Salce. The film's success led to a sequel, Il secondo tragico Fantozzi, with the same director in the following year, in which Fantozzi delivered his most famous line: \\"Per me... La corazzata Kotiomkin ... √® una cagata pazzesca!!!\\", or roughly \\"As I see it... Battleship Kotiomkin ... is an unbelievable load of crap!!!\\". Six sequel books were then released, with the last one published in 2012. Seven other films followed, which ended in 1999, but were often much less based on the short stories and the books. ===Other films=== Villaggio has played in numerous comedies. He has been directed by Federico Fellini (La voce della luna, 1990, with Roberto Benigni), Lina Wertm√ºller (Io speriamo che me la cavo, 1992), by Ermanno Olmi (The Secret of the Old Woods, 1993), by Mario Monicelli (Cari fottutissimi amici, 1994), and by Gabriele Salvatores (Denti, 2000). Villaggio continued writing while acting in films. He moved to the Mondadori publishing house in 1994. He published Fantozzi saluta e se ne va (1994‚Äì1995; \\"Fantozzi Says Goodbye and Leaves\\"), Vita morte e miracoli di un pezzo di merda (\\"Life, Death and Miracles of a Piece of Shit\\", 2002), 7 grammi in 70 anni (\\"7 Grammes in 70 Years\\", 2003) and his latest, Sono incazzato come una belva (\\"I'm Fucking Mad as a Beast\\") in 2004. He also acted in stage plays, playing Arpagone in L'Avare of Moli√®re in 1996. In 1996 he also led the satirical news bulletin Striscia la notizia (broadcast on Canale 5), together with Massimo Boldi. More recently, he participated in the television fiction Carabinieri, in which he played the role of a tramp who often helped the police to solve crimes. Villaggio was also a lyricist. With fellow Genoan Fabrizio De Andr√©, he wrote two songs, \\"Carlo Martello torna dalla battaglia di Poitiers\\" (\\"Charles Martel returning from the Battle of Poitiers\\") and \\"Il fannullone\\" (\\"The Loafer\\"). ==Death== Villaggio died on 3 July 2017 from complications of diabetes in Rome at the age of 84. ==Selected filmography== *I quattro del pater noster (1969) *Pensando a te (1969) *Il terribile ispettore (1969) *Eat It (1969) *Brancaleone at the Crusades (1970) *Without Family (1972) *Beati i ricchi (1972) *What Am I Doing in the Middle of a Revolution?

She is a three- time World Champion on the vault (2005‚Äì2007) and 2006 World Champion on floor exercise. She was a member of the gold medal-winning Chinese teams for the 2006 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Aarhus, Denmark and 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China. She was also a member of the silver medal- winning Chinese team for the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany. ==Biography== Cheng Fei was born in central China's Hubei Province to a father who was a shipping clerk and a mother who worked in a tire factory, not a very wealthy background. Indeed, said her mother, \\"Our family was poor so we hoped Cheng Fei could in some way change her life...we thought maybe being a professional athlete is good for her.\\" And so her parents approached a gymnastics coach about training her by the time she was three and her father practiced calisthenics with her every morning before school. By the age of five, Cheng won her first competitive medal at a local competition. The 7-year-old Cheng was sent to Wuhan, where she joined the Wuhan Institute of Physical Education and officially entered the national sports program. Her first coach, Yao Juying remembered her as being uniquely 'hard-working' and extraordinarily focused. At ten, she was invited to join the Hubei provincial team. In late 2001, at the age of 13, she was accepted to the Chinese National Team. Her coaches are head coach Lu Shanzhen, and Liu Qun Lin. Cheng Fei is well known in the sporting world for being highly consistent, powerful and elegant, as well as displaying a fine level of sportsmanship. Sandra Izba»ôa, 2008 Olympic Floor Champion has described her as a perfectionist, a great sport and a good friend. Shawn Johnson, 2008 Olympic Beam Champion, was also quoted to have called Cheng Fei 'inspirational' and 'a great competitor'. Cheng Fei's leadership abilities are of paramount importance to the Chinese Women's Gymnastics Team. She retired in June 2012 due to a ruptured Achilles tendon while performing a tumbling pass on the floor. ==Competitive history== Cheng Fei is a vaulting and floor exercise specialist. She has had national success in gymnastics as a two-time Chinese National Floor Exercise Champion (2004‚Äì2005), a two-time Chinese National Vault medalist (2003 and 2005) and the 2004 Chinese National Balance Beam Champion. Internationally, she has been very successful as well. She competed with the Chinese team at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece and although the team did not medal, she performed very well, scoring 9.475 on vault and 9.662 on floor. She also qualified for and competed in the floor exercise final, finishing 4th with a score of 9.412. She was the bronze medalist at the 2004 World Cup Final on floor exercise. On 23 November 2005 Cheng made history at the 2005 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Melbourne, Australia, for being the first gymnast ever to successfully perform one of the most difficult vaults ever attempted by a woman. The vault consisting of: a round- off onto the springboard, a half-turn onto the vaulting horse and a 1¬Ω somersault with a 540-degree turn in a straight body position, is now officially recognized in the FIG Code of Points as \\"The Cheng\\" which carries a D-score of 6.5 under the 2009 Code of Points. During Event Finals on vault in Melbourne, Cheng scored 9.725 in her first vault (S.V: 10.0) and 9.587 in her second vault (S.V: 10.0), the \\"Cheng\\". At the 2006 World Championships in Aarhus, Denmark, she competed on vault and floor exercise, qualifying in first position for both event finals. Her performances on those two pieces of apparatus were instrumental in securing victory for China in the team championship, but they also earned her the individual vault and floor exercise world titles. Cheng also won the gold medal on the vault at the 2006 World Cup Final in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. In 2007 Cheng began the year by winning the vault, balance beam and floor exercise titles at a World Cup event in Maribor, Slovenia. She was undefeated on vaulting and floor exercise in 2007 until the 2007 World Championships in Stuttgart, Germany. At those championships, Cheng was recognized as the leader for the Chinese women's team and though Cheng won her third World title on the vault, she made a serious error on the vault during the team championship where the Chinese team finished 2nd. She went on to finish 5th on floor exercise, with a score of 15.050, after stepping out of the bounds with both feet in her final tumbling series. Cheng fulfilled her goal of competing at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China as the captain to the Chinese team. In the qualification, Cheng competed on three events, placing first on both vault and floor exercise, and fifth on balance beam. She was one of three female gymnasts to have entered 3 Olympic Event Finals in those Games, along with Nastia Liukin and Anna Pavlova. In the team final, She led the team to win China's first-ever women's gymnastics Olympic team gold medal in history. Individually, she won a bronze medal on vault (even after falling on her own \\"Cheng Fei vault\\"). She got 16.075 and 15.025 on her saltos. She won another bronze medal on balance beam (15.950) and placing 7th in the floor exercise event final (14.550), after an uncharacteristic fall. Cheng cried after the unfortunate vault and floor finals. After the Olympics, she said that she cried about her failure to capture the two gold medals she wanted most until she could cry no more. However, she received great support from both her fellow countrymen and the international gymnastics community, who acknowledged her talents and abilities as an exceptional gymnast. In a show of respect she gave the winner of the balance beam final Shawn Johnson of United States a small box with silk inside it. After the Olympic Games, she competed in various competitions. She won three gold medals on vault, floor exercise and balance beam at the DTG World Cup in Stuttgart. Her last 2008 competition was the 14th Artistic Gymnastics World Cup in Madrid where she won two gold medals on vault and floor exercise. In 2009, she competed at the 25th Universiade in Belgrade and won a team Gold medal and a Silver medal on Vault. After a near two-year off from competitions due to a leg injury, she competed in the 2011 Chinese National Championships in May on vault and floor Exercise. She led the qualifications on vault and finished 2nd in the final. She announced her intention to compete in the University Games in August, but was reported to be suffering from leg injury again and retreated from the competition. In April 2012, Cheng competed at the Zibo World Cup in her home country, qualifying second into the vault final behind the Dominican Republic's Yamilet Pe√±a Abreu. She intended to compete floor as well, but withdrew prior to the qualifying round. Cheng won the gold medal in the vault final. Cheng injured her Achilles tendon in June 2012, taking her out of the running for the 2012 Chinese Olympic Team. In June 2012, she announced her retirement from elite artistic gymnastics, trying to switch from being an elite gymnast to a gymnastics coach. ==SkillsEponymous skills=== Vault: Yurchenko ¬Ω on into 1¬Ω twists off (6.0) ===Competitive Routines=== As of 2008, Cheng Fei performed the following skills on these apparatuses: {  Apparatus  Skills  A Score (2008 Code of Points) -  rowspan=\\"2\\"  Vault  1.

Unlike the other stations on the NSL (apart from Canberra station), the station has side platforms due to engineering constraints. Located underneath the traffic junction of Lorong 1 Toa Payoh and Lorong 2 Toa Payoh, Braddell station primarily serves the estates in the northern part of Toa Payoh New Town. Opened on 7 November 1987, Braddell station is one of the first five MRT stations on the network. ==History== Exit B of Braddell MRT station at night. Platform A of Braddell MRT. When the MRT system was under planning since 1981, MRTC tried to design the track system and position in order to enable the station to have a common platform, like in the mainstream MRT stations. However, the closely built HDB Blocks in Toa Payoh estate meant that the MRT system tunnels had to be constructed directly under Lorong 2 Toa Payoh, following the bend of the road, in the area between Lorong 1 Toa Payoh and Toa Payoh MRT Station. The result made it impossible for tracks to diverge at a common platform station, as the angle Southbound trains would turn when approaching and leaving the station would be too great. Additionally, it would be unfeasible to change the position of the station, because moving it south would render it too close to Toa Payoh MRT station, while moving it north would be impossible because of surrounding HDB blocks and JTC Flatted factories. It was thus built with side platforms unlike other NSL stations. Construction of this station was awarded to Singapore Belgium Contractors Limited under Contract 103A on 7 April 1984.Braddell MRT Station construction awarded To facilitate the construction, two of the six lanes at Toa Payoh Lorong 1 and 2, were temporarily closed from February 1985 to February 1986. Braddell was among the first of five stations opened for operation on 7 November 1987. ===Incidents=== On 7 May 2008, a robber tried to rob from the 7-Eleven convenience store within the station at 3:10pm, but was instead locked in the shop by the cashier who dashed out of the shop. The robber could not escape and the Police arrived shortly but the robber threatened to commit suicide. The robber was finally apprehended by the police's taser gun and arrested. On 7 October 2017, water got into a section of the tunnel between Bishan and Braddell MRT stations during a heavy downpour in the afternoon, which disrupted train services along 13 stations on the North South line for several hours. This case of water entering MRT tunnels is believed to be the first time it has affected train service along the NSL. Separately, at about 5.55pm, a small fire was spotted trackside in the tunnel between the Marina Bay and Raffles Place stations, but it had died down by itself. It is not clear if it is linked to the flood, although electrical short circuits caused by water had sparked tunnel fires before. Train services between Marina South Pier and Newton were restored on the day itself at about 9.20pm. Train services between Newton and Ang Mo Kio were fully resumed at 1.36pm the following day after overnight efforts to clear the water in the tunnel, after nearly 21 hours of service disruption, being one of the worst disruptions in SMRT Trains Ltd's history. It was revealed that the overflowing in the tunnel was caused by a malfunction in the water pumping system, which has since been repaired. ==ReferencesCategory:1987 establishments in Singapore Category:Toa Payoh Category:Railway stations opened in 1987 Category:Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) stations ","title":"Braddell MRT station"},{"id":"2232489","text":"High-rise apartment buildings along English Bay English Bay is located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, west of the downtown peninsula and False Creek. It consists of the south side of the Burrard Inlet, extending from Point Grey in the southwest to Prospect Point in the northeast. ==Location== English Bay Beach, near the city's West End residential neighbourhood, is a popular sunbathing, swimming, and sunset-watching beach in the downtown Vancouver area. Other downtown beaches facing English Bay include Sunset Beach, Second Beach, and Third Beach. Along the south shore of the bay lie Kitsilano Beach, Jericho Beach, the Spanish Banks beaches, and Locarno Beach, while on the North Shore are Ambleside Beach and various smaller cove-beaches in the city of West Vancouver. English Bay beaches are all major tourist attraction to visitors all year long, with the peak season being late summer. The Vancouver Seawall runs all the way around English Bay from Stanley Park in the northeast around False Creek at Point Grey facing the Strait of Georgia in the southwest. This is a favourite destination for walkers, runners, bicyclists, and roller-bladers. (Note: the Seawall is one-way for cyclists and roller-bladers, running counter-clockwise from just east of Lions Gate Bridge to Third Beach.) English Bay Beach is host to a number of public events. The Celebration of Light is a fireworks competition that is held for two weeks every summer (usually the last week in July and first week in August). While this competition often struggles to secure funding, it has successfully run since 1990 and is the largest off-shore fireworks display in the world. Each winter it is the host of Vancouvers' annual Polar Bear Swim and each summer the Vancouver Pride Parade and Festival is held on English Bay Beach. ==History== In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, English Bay Beach was home to Vancouver's first official lifeguard, the legendary Joe Fortes, who taught hundreds of the city's early residents how to swim, and patrolled the beach from his cabin on its shore. Today, the waters of the bay are often dotted with hundreds of small pleasure boats, as well as huge freighters waiting at anchor to load cargoes at Vancouver's port. The beach was the site of an oil spill in Vancouver on April 8, 2015. The official cause of the spill has not been confirmed, but at least 2700 litres of \\"bunker fuel\\" are known to have escaped from a cargo ship into the bay. The highly toxic oil later washed up on nearby beaches, creating a slick 15‚Äì20 cm thick. At least twenty seabirds were injured or affected by the spill,CBC News on TV but the full extent of any environmental and economic damage is unknown at this early stage. The federal government was criticized for its response to the spill, including the delay in notifying the public of the health hazard, by the mayor and premier, environmental scientists, and an international shipping expert. Coast Guard officials defended the response, with regional director Assistant Commissioner Roger Girouard saying, \\"it was exceptional\\". The beaches were tested and most were reopened following a ten-day closure. While the water and soil at most of the beaches tested was found not to have harmful levels of oil present, the government cautioned that \\"small amounts\\" of oil may remain, and urged people to be aware of the possible hazard and avoid contact with any oil. The reopened beaches will continue to be tested and the need for further cleanup assessed as needed. ==Gallery== File:English_Bay_First_Beach.jpgLooking along English Bay Beach in the West End File:English Bay Beach Vancouver (42912670420).jpgthumbEnglish Bay Beach, Vancouver File:English_Bay_01.jpgEnglish Bay at sunset File:StanleyPark4.jpgEnglish Bay Pier from Stanley Park File:Sunset on the inuksuk at English Bay.jpgSunset on the inuksuk at English Bay File:English Bay Vancouver (43813270275).jpgthumbEnglish Bay Vancouver ==References *English Bay Beach *Vancouver Polar Bear Swim Club * Category:Bays of British Columbia Category:Coast of British Columbia Category:Landforms of Vancouver Category:Beaches of Vancouver ","title":"English Bay, Vancouver"},{"id":"2232496","text":"Music from \\"The Elder\\" is the ninth studio album released by American rock band Kiss on the Casablanca Records label in 1981.

Critical reception for the album was relatively kind on release, but the album proved to be a commercial failure and was for a long time largely unpopular with the involved parties, label and musicians alike, as well as critics, even sometimes being called one of the worst albums ever. Nevertheless, it has garnered some positive reappraisal in recent years, with some critics admitting the record had its issues, but that it was still a concept album worthy of note. ==Album information== Kiss was in the midst of a transitional phase as the 1980s began. Peter Criss was not involved in the recording of 1980's Unmasked: he officially left Kiss in May of the same year. His replacement (Eric Carr) was officially introduced in July. The group had recently embarked on a hugely successful tour of Australia and New Zealand (where the group's popularity was at its peak) in November, but the band's commercial fortunes at home were drastically reduced from the 1975‚Äì79 era. Due to the lackluster sales of Unmasked, Kiss toured exclusively outside the U.S. for the first time in their career (except for one concert at the Palladium Theatre in New York). The overseas tours were well attended, partly because Kiss had rarely ventured abroad and because the more pop- oriented Dynasty and Unmasked albums did better in the European markets than their earlier hard rock albums. This commercial downturn is attributable to many factors; two of the biggest being the softening of Kiss' image in an effort to appeal to a broader fanbase and the softening of their music. Unmasked was a decidedly more pop-oriented effort than earlier albums, and represented a sales drop-off of 65% from 1979's Dynasty. It also became the first Kiss album to fail to achieve platinum status since 1975's Dressed to Kill. The glut of Kiss merchandising that had cropped up in the late 1970s led to a backlash from many fans who felt that Kiss was then more concerned with making money than with making good music. In an effort to return to their hard rock roots, Kiss began recording music more akin to the hard rock style that launched them to popularity in the mid-1970s. The fall 1980 issue of the Kiss Army Newsletter hinted at the style the new album was to take: \\"It will be hard and heavy from start to finish, straight-on rock and roll that will knock your socks off.\\" But at the same time, Simmons, Stanley, and creative manager Bill Aucoin felt that just returning to a harder sound was not enough. They believed that only a bold, artistic statement would regenerate public interest in Kiss. To that end, they enlisted producer Bob Ezrin to work with the group, who, in turn, employed members from the American Symphony Orchestra and St. Robert's Choir to record tracks for the album. Ezrin had worked with the group before, producing the group's hit 1976 album Destroyer. He had also co- produced Pink Floyd's 1979 concept album The Wall. Simmons, Stanley, and Aucoin felt that Ezrin could help bring their ambitions to fruition. The original vinyl release was a gatefold sleeve. This was the first Kiss album to feature no image of the group, not even the customary front-cover appearance. According to one story, the hand reaching for the door knocker is not that of Stanley: Aucoin has stated that it belongs to a handmodel, hired for the shoot; however, in 2011 a photo surfaced from the album cover shoot showing a partially naked-faced Stanley with his hand on the door knocker. The door itself was long rumored to be located at the Park Ave United Methodist church on Park Avenue, New York City, but was actually a prop created for the shoot. The photo session displayed a change of image: the costumes were more streamlined, especially when compared with the costumes for Unmasked, as were the hairstyles of Stanley and Simmons in particular. Recording sessions for the album commenced in March 1981. Sessions were held in Toronto, New York City, and Frehley's home recording studio in Wilton, Connecticut. During the recording, Ezrin and Kiss worked in complete secrecy. Ezrin, in particular, had insisted that he would only communicate with Kiss or Aucoin. No one other than Ezrin and Kiss ever heard the album in progress. Frehley became increasingly frustrated during the sessions, as he disagreed with the band's decision to abandon their original plan to record a straight rock album. Additionally, a number of guitar solos Frehley recorded were not included in the final cut.Leaf, David and Ken Sharp. Kiss: Behind the Mask: The Official Authorized Biography, Warner Books, 2003. Frehley was often outvoted 2‚Äì1 on band decisions after Criss' departure. Carr was not a partner in Kiss as the other three members were, but rather an employee. Frehley resented what he felt was Simmons' and Stanley's domination of the recording sessions. ==Reception== When Kiss premiered Music from \\"The Elder\\" for their management and record company in October 1981, the reaction was a mixture of confusion and resentment. Business manager Howard Marks refused to allow his company's name to appear in the liner notes. Fan reaction to the album was equally harsh, while critical reaction was comparably positive. But while reviews like the one printed by Rolling Stone were much kinder than past reviews,Considine, J.D. February 18, 1982. Music from \\"The Elder\\" review. Rolling Stone. Retrieved June 29, 2006. the album quickly disappeared from the charts by February, 1982. Q magazine ranked Music From \\"The Elder\\" 44th in their list of The 50 Worst Albums Ever. The same magazine ranked the album 6th in their list of 15 Albums Where Great Rock Acts Lost the Plot.Q Magazine.15 Albums Where Great Rock Acts Lost the Plot.NOTE:Look for number 48. Retrieved May 14, 2011. Although budgets were prepared for a tour, none was ever undertaken. The only public appearances the band made in conjunction with the album were a January 15, 1982 appearance on the late-night variety show Fridays (they performed \\"A World Without Heroes\\", \\"I\\" and \\"The Oath\\"), Solid Gold (\\"A World Without Heroes\\" and \\"I\\"), and a January 28 lip synched performance of \\"I\\" from Studio 54, broadcast via satellite to the Sanremo Festival in Italy. Frehley was absent for the Studio 54 appearance, so the group performed as a trio. Most participants in the album's recording admit that it was a major misstep for Kiss. Ezrin, despite his recent success with the even more ambitious Wall album, admitted that his judgments concerning Music from \\"The Elder\\" were clouded due in large part to a cocaine addiction at the time. Stanley and Simmons admit that they were \\"delusional\\" concerning the project, while Frehley has stated that he felt that it was not a good idea to begin with. There are rumors that The Elder has sold around 500,000 copies, however, this has yet to be substantiated by any official audit, and has not been certified gold as of 2018. ===Accolades=== Despite the general negative feelings towards this album, it has garnered some occasional praise in recent years. In 2011, Spanish authors Alberto D√≠az and Xavi Mart√≠nez included it in their book Concept albums: 150 essential releases. Also in 2011, the American website Guitar World mentioned the album among their 50 Great Albums Celebrating Their 30th Anniversary in 2011 while the Brazilian magazine Roadie Crew did likewise in a list of The 81 Greatest Albums of 1981. Roadie Crew would later, in 2017, rank it among their greatest 40 concept albums ever, at #22. In 2016, Classic Rock ranked the album among a list of The 20 Most Underrated Classic Rock Albums Ever, calling the album \\"anomalous\\" but stating that it \\"nonetheless has much to recommend it\\". In 2018, the French edition of the Rock Hard magazine included it in the Volume 2 of its \\"ideal metaltheque\\", in the concept albums category. ==Story== The basic plot of \\"The Elder\\" involves the recruitment and training of a young hero (The Boy) by the Council of Elders who belong to the Order of the Rose, a mysterious group dedicated to combating evil. The Boy is guided by an elderly caretaker named Morpheus. The album's lyrics describe the boy's feelings during his journey and training, as he overcomes his early doubts to become confident and self-assured. The only spoken dialogue is at the end of the last track, \\"I\\". During the passage, Morpheus proclaims to the Elders that The Boy is ready to undertake his odyssey. ==Songs== Dutch single cover to \\"I\\" b/w \\"The Oath\\" single. Australian single cover of the \\"A World Without Heroes\\" b/w \\"Dark Light\\" single. The version of Music from \\"The Elder\\" released in the US, Europe and Brazil contained a different song order than the one originally intended. This order was chosen in order to emphasize \\"The Oath\\" and \\"A World Without Heroes\\" as potential singles (the two songs started each side of the record). One effect of this alteration in song order was to disrupt the narrative flow of the album's story. The Japanese pressing of the album contained the intended song sequence, although \\"Escape from the Island\\" was excluded from the album and instead included as the B-side of \\"The Oath\\" single. This sequence was used (with the inclusion of \\"Escape from the Island\\") when Music from \\"The Elder\\" was re-released on CD in 1997.Music From \\"The Elder\\". The KISSFAQ. Retrieved April 27, 2006. A number of narrative passages were cut from the final version of the album. These passages were meant to provide details of the story, and to act as transitional elements between songs. ===\\"The Oath\\"=== A heavy metal track that opened the original version of the album, many parts of the song also feature Stanley singing in falsetto, a vocal technique he utilized on several of the album's tracks. Stanley played lead and rhythm guitars, while Frehley played bass. ===\\"Dark Light\\"=== \\"Dark Light\\", written by Frehley, was based on a guitar riff composed by Anton Fig. When it was originally recorded as a pre-Music from \\"The Elder\\" demo, the title was \\"Don't Run\\". It is the only song Frehley sings on the album. ===\\"A World Without Heroes\\"=== The lone American single from the album was originally entitled \\"Every Little Bit of Your Heart\\". The name was changed when it was decided to record Music from \\"The Elder\\" as a concept album. Lou Reed wrote the lyric \\"a world without heroes is like a world without sun.\\"Sharp, Ken.

Nederlands cabaret, 1970‚Äì1995: het is weer tijd om te bepalen waar het allemaal op staat. Nijgh & Van Ditmar, 1996. p. 104 With their style of upbeat dance/pop, they scored many hits throughout Europe. The sextet consisted of Angela Groothuizen, Ang√©la Kramers, Anita Heilker, Esther Oosterbeek, Patty Zomer and Ria Brieffies. ==Biography== The Dolly Dots had many hits between 1979 and 1988. They were most successful in the Netherlands, but they also scored hits in the rest of Europe. Their single \\"Radio\\" was a big hit in Japan. \\"P.S.\\" was a Top 50 Billboard Hot Dance Club Play hit in 1981. They also enjoyed hits in Turkey, Lebanon, Iceland, and toured through Egypt. Although the band never cracked England, they did feature on the 23 June 1983 edition of Top of the Pops when they were interviewed by DJ John Peel whilst on location in Amsterdam. At the peak of their success in 1984, the Dolly Dots had their own TV series, Barbie Dolls, Wallpaper, and a #1 hit, \\"Love Me Just a Little Bit More (Totally Hooked on You)\\". At the end of the following year, Anita Heilker left the group to have a daughter. She later became the Dutch voice of Donald Duck. The rest of the band continued as a five-piece. Heilker had already launched her own career. In 1986, she released four solo singles (\\"You've Got Me Keyed Up\\", \\"Into the Night\\", \\"Dancing on the Moon\\" and \\"Don't Treat Me Like This\\"), as well as a solo album (The Girl in Black). Since the TV series' success in 1984, there had been plans to record a Hollywood film. In the summer of 1986, the five remaining Dolly Dots finally went to the US to work with an unfinished script and made a movie called Dutch Treat, which was released later that year. The movie (starring Lorin Dreyfuss and David Landsberg) and its soundtrack were modest successes in The Netherlands but were not released in the US due to poor reviews. The group broke up in 1988. Their last single was an attempt to break into the UK market. The Dolly Dots teamed up with hit producers Stock Aitken Waterman and released the song \\"What a Night\\". It reached number 18 in the Dutch charts, but was not successful in the UK. On October 2, 1988, the Dolly Dots played a farewell show at the Amsterdam Escape. After more than 9 years, they felt the time was right to go their separate ways. Ria Brieffies was later quoted \\"There's more to life than being a Dolly Dot\\". ==Solo careers== In 1989, Anita Heilker taped a sitcom with satirical duo Henk Spaan and Harry Vermeegen (Die 2, \\"Those 2\\" in English) for early 1990 broadcast on Veronica. Angela Groothuizen teamed up with Ruud Mulder, former guitarist of disco/funk- contemporaries Spargo, to record as Angela & the Rude. She also began a television hosting career for AVRO starting in 1990 with an adaptation of Challenge Anneka; this was followed by Sex with Angela and later, Who's the Mole?. Her contract expired in 2005 and was not renewed. Groothuizen has since moved to RTL 4 where she was a panel judge for X Factor, The Voice of Holland and The Voice Kids. She is also host of the show Een Nieuw Begin. Groothuizen is still making music and has her own theatre shows. Patty Zomer became a fashion stylist for several well-known Dutch artists and magazines. In the early 2000s, she co-hosted The Fashion Police with former actress Nada van Nie. On October 1, 1998, all six Dolly Dots were interviewed by Paul de Leeuw and surprised everyone by singing a medley of three of their biggest hits. Two months later they reunited for a one-off concert to celebrate the 10th anniversary of their split, and the release of a compilation album of all their hits, called The Collection. In 2003, Aad Ouberg, who was closely involved with the group, was responsible for getting a Dolly Dots musical off the ground. The musical Love Me Just a Little Bit More played at The Chass√© Theatre in Breda and around the Netherlands during 2004. As result of renewed interest in the group after the musical, Warner Bros. Records released a Dolly Dots greatest hits compilation album of the group as well as a DVD. In 2007, all six original members reunited for a series of guest performances during Vrienden van Amstel Live. Their success there led to three concerts of their own in Ahoy Rotterdam. The DVD of those concerts reached gold status in the Netherlands. In 2008, a tour followed, called 'Goodbye for Now'. Ria Brieffies, who went on to pursue culinary interests, was diagnosed with cancer in November 2008; she died on July 20, 2009. Angela Groothuizen announced that without Brieffies, the Dolly Dots would never perform again. In 2011, Anita Heilker made her comeback as a solo artist in a Dutch show called The Winner Is...

He is best known as a co-founder of Tears for Fears, of which he is the main songwriter and joint vocalist, but he has also achieved success as a producer of other artists including Oleta Adams and Emiliana Torrini. In 2014, Orzabal published his first novel. ==Early life== Orzabal was born in Portsmouth, Hampshire. Initially raised in Havant, his family later moved to Bath where he attended Culverhay School and became a member of the Zenith Youth Theatre Company. Orzabal's mother is English and his father (George Orzabal de la Quintana) is Spaniard. Orzabal was named Raoul for the first two weeks after his birth, but this was changed to Roland as the family was living in England. When Orzabal was three years old, his father had a nervous breakdown which left him semi-bedridden for a large portion of Orzabal's childhood. His father decided to run an entertainment business with his mother, a dancer, resulting in different entertainers often hanging around Orzabal's home. He describes his childhood as \\"unorthodox,\\" and it inspired various Tears for Fears songs, particularly on The Hurting. ==CareerEarly career=== Orzabal met Curt Smith while both were in their early teens in Bath, Somerset. In the late-1970s, they formed a mod music group, Graduate, along with three other members. Following the release of their debut album, Acting My Age, the group disbanded and Orzabal and Smith went on to form Tears for Fears, a new wave/synthpop outfit directly inspired by the writings of the American psychologist Arthur Janov. ===Solo work=== Orzabal in 2007 After a decade of major international success, Orzabal and Smith acrimoniously split in the early 1990s. Orzabal continued to work as Tears for Fears after he and Smith parted ways; the subsequent albums Elemental (1993) and Raoul and the Kings of Spain (1995) are effectively solo works by him in all but name. Elemental was a success being certified as Gold status in the US and Silver in the UK, while Raoul took a more artistic direction but garnered less chart success. In 2001 he released his first proper solo album, Tomcats Screaming Outside, under his own name. Orzabal and Smith had reconciled by that point and were working together on Tears for Fears's next album, Everybody Loves a Happy Ending (2004). ===Work as a producer/songwriter=== As a songwriter, Orzabal is a two-time Ivor Novello Award winner. His first award was in 1986 for \\"Songwriter of the Year\\" following the release of Tears for Fears' second album Songs from the Big Chair for which Orzabal wrote or co-wrote all of the tracks. Orzabal, with Curt Smith are responsible for discovering musician and songwriter Oleta Adams, whom they brought into the band and who sang on the single Woman in Chains from the 1989 Tears for Fears album The Seeds of Love as a duet with Orzabal.VH1.com Biography Oleta Adams. (Retrieved: September 15, 2006) Orzabal co-produced Oleta Adams' album Circle of One (1990). The album reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 20 in the US, and featured her transatlantic top ten hit \\"Get Here\\". Orzabal also co-wrote the lead track \\"Rhythm of Life\\" for the album, which was originally intended for The Seeds of Love. As well as playing guitar and singing backing vocals on the track, he also appeared in the song's accompanying promo video. In 1999, Orzabal co-produced the Icelandic singer- songwriter Emiliana Torrini's album Love in the Time of Science, along with Tears for Fears associate Alan Griffiths. The pair also wrote two tracks for the album. Orzabal's talents as a songwriter were recognised again after Michael Andrews and Gary Jules recorded the song \\"Mad World\\" for the film soundtrack Donnie Darko in 2001. Their version was released as a single in 2003 and became the Christmas number one single in the UK that year, ultimately becoming the year's biggest selling single. The song was originally composed by Orzabal and was Tears for Fears' first hit single in 1982. In 2004, the song won Orzabal his second Ivor Novello Award, as the songwriter of the Best Selling UK Single of 2003. ==Other activitiesNovel=== Orzabal has written a novel, a romantic comedy entitled Sex, Drugs & Opera, published in 2014. It tells the story of a middle-aged pop star, Solomon Capri, who is semi-retired but is approached to take part in the reality show Popstar to Operastar which he sees as a way to rejuvenate his career and his waning marriage. The story was inspired by Orzabal's own experience as he was approached by the ITV show himself, though did not take part. ==Personal life== In 1985, Orzabal's difficult relationship with his father was parodied in a cartoon published in the UK tabloid The Sun. This cartoon was reproduced by the band on the artwork for the Tears for Fears single \\"I Believe\\". Orzabal married Caroline Johnston at Bath Register Office in 1982. Caroline can be heard singing the child vocal on the Tears for Fears song \\"Suffer the Children\\" from the band's debut album The Hurting, and also drew the \\"hands\\" cover artwork for the 1983 re-release of \\"Pale Shelter\\". In June 2017, Caroline died suddenly from natural causes. Tears for Fears initially withdrew in July from the remaining shows on the North American tour they were co- headlining with Hall & Oates but resumed the tour on 14 September 2017, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. On his doctor's advice, Orzabal withdrew from 2018 concert dates. He said \\"following the death of my wife, everything imaginable started to go wrong. You just don‚Äôt know how your body is going to respond.\\" In 2019 he resumed touring. ==DiscographySolo albums=== *Tomcats Screaming Outside (2001) ===with Graduate=== *Acting My Age (1980) ===with Tears for Fears=== *The Hurting (1983) *Songs from the Big Chair (1985) *The Seeds of Love (1989) *Elemental (1993) *Raoul and the Kings of Spain (1995) *Everybody Loves a Happy Ending (2004) ==References== Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century English singers Category:21st-century English singers Category:APRA Award winners Category:British people of Basque descent Category:English people of Spanish descent Category:English male singers Category:English new wave musicians Category:English songwriters Category:English record producers Category:Male new wave singers Category:English rock singers Category:English socialists Category:Tears for Fears members Category:People from Portsmouth Category:Ivor Novello Award winners Category:People from Havant ","title":"Roland Orzabal"},{"id":"2232502","text":"The Compatibility Encoding Scheme for UTF-16: 8-Bit (CESU-8) is a variant of UTF-8 that is described in Unicode Technical Report #26.

They are seldom used for the description of other languages even though a distinction between vowels that usually have to be followed by a consonant and other vowels is common in most Germanic languages. The terms checked vowel and free vowel correspond closely to the terms lax vowel and tense vowel respectively, but many linguists prefer to use the terms checked and free, as there is no clearcut phonetic definition of vowel tenseness and because by most attempted definitions of tenseness and are considered lax even though they behave in American English as free vowels. Checked vowels is also used to refer to a kind of very short glottalized vowels found in some Zapotecan languages that contrast with laryngealized vowels. The term checked vowel is also used to refer to a short vowel followed by a glottal stop in Mixe, which has a distinction between two kinds of glottalized syllable nuclei: checked ones, with the glottal stop after a short vowel, and nuclei with rearticulated vowels, a long vowel with a glottal stop in the middle. ==English== In English, the checked vowels are the following: * as in pit * as in pet * as in pat * as in pot (in varieties without the cot-caught merger or the father‚Äìbother merger) * as in put, foot * as in putt, strut There are a few exceptions, mostly in interjections: eh with ; duh, huh, uh, uh-uh, and uh-huh with ; nah and yeah with . There are also the onomatopoeia baa for and the loanword pho for when pronounced in American English. The proper names Graham and Flaherty are sometimes pronounced with a prevocalic . The free vowels are the following: * as in pee * as in pay * as in poo * as in Poe, no * as in paw, ball * as in bra * as in purr, burr * as in ply, buy * as in pow, bow * as in ploy, boy The schwa and rhotacized schwa are usually considered neither free nor checked because they cannot stand in stressed syllables. The term checked vowel is also useful in the description of English spelling. As free written vowels a, e, i, o, u correspond to the spoken vowels , , , , ; as checked vowels a, e, i, o, u correspond to , , , , . In spelling free and checked vowels are often called long and short, based on their historical pronunciation, though nowadays some or all of the free vowels are diphthongs, depending on the dialect, not long vowels as such. Written consonant doubling often shows the vowel is checked; the i of dinner corresponds to checked because of the double consonants nn; the i of diner corresponds to free because of the single consonant n. This, however, interferes with the differences in doubling rules between American and British styles of spelling, say travelled versus traveled. Similarly, a \\"silent e\\" following a single consonant at the end of a word often indicates that the preceding vowel is free where it would otherwise be checked; for example, the a of tap corresponding to whereas that in tape corresponds to . ==See also== *List of phonetics topics *Checked tone of Chinese ==References== Category:Vowels Category:English phonology ","title":"Checked and free vowels"},{"id":"2232537","text":"Switzerland during the Roman era, showing Aventicum and the Helvetii region Carved limestone objects from Aventicum Aventicum was the largest town and capital of Roman Switzerland (Helvetia or Civitas Helvetiorum). Its remains are beside the modern town of Avenches. The city was probably created ex nihilo in the early 1st century AD, as the capital of the recently conquered territory of the Helvetii, across the road that connected Italy to Britain, built under Claudius. Under the rule of Emperor Vespasian, who grew up there, Aventicum was raised to the status of a colonia in 72 AD, whereupon it entered its golden age. The town wall was long but was impracticable for defensive purposes and was doubtless intended as a display of the status of the city. In the Christian era Aventicum was the seat of a bishopric. The most famous of its bishops was Marius Aventicensis. His terse chronicle, spanning the years 455 to 581, is one of the few sources for the 6th-century Burgundians. Shortly after the Council of Macon, in 585, Marius moved the seat from Aventicum, due to the rapid decline of the city, to Lausanne. ==Prehistoric Aventicum== The area around Aventicum was occupied before the Romans founded the city. There have been numerous lake-dwellings such as, Lacustre, discovered within the adjoining Lake Murten, with at least 16 stilt house settlements having been found. In the largest site, the piles extend over an area of thus forming a large station or village. A great number of objects have been found buried in the mud amongst the piles, consisting of implements of stone and bone, such as hatchets, chisels, needles, awls, besides a vast quantity of the bones of animals. The pottery is a coarse, dark red kind of earthenware containing numerous grains of quartz, and there are 12 or 15 varieties.Miles (Mar-Aug 1888) 415 ==Migration of the Helvetii== Die Helvetier zwingen die R√∂mer unter dem Joch hindurch (The Helvetians force the Romans to pass under the yoke). Romantic painting by Charles Gleyre (19th century) celebrating the Helvetian victory over the Romans at Agen (107 BC) under Divico's command. The Helvetii probably reached southern Germany around the year 111 BC and soon invaded Gaul. During their invasion of the Roman Provincia Narbonensis they defeated a Roman army under L. Cassius Longinus near Agendicum in 107 BC and killed the consul. They continued to march into Spain, Gaul, Noricum, and northern Italy. Suffering defeats in the year 102-101 BC the surviving Helvetii retreated across the Alps. In 58 BC the nobleman Orgetorix instigated a new Helvetian migration, in which the entire tribe was to leave their territory (which is now described as corresponding more or less to the Swiss plateau) and establish supremacy over all of Gaul. They marched from their villages, but were stalled by Julius Caesar on the banks of the Rh√¥ne. The Helvetii then marched around and across the Jura Mountains, to an area near the Aeduan oppidum Bibracte. There Caesar caught up and defeated the Helvetii in the Battle of Bibracte. This resulted in the Helvetii's retreat and the capture of most of their baggage by the Romans. Following their surrender the Helvetii became foederati, an allied civitas required to provide soldiers, but not granted Roman citizenship. The Helvetii likely lost their status as foederati six years later, when they supported Vercingetorix in 52 BC. Sometime between 50 and 45 BC, the Romans founded the Colonia Iulia Equestris at the site of the Helvetian settlement Noviodunum (modern Nyon). This colony was most likely established as a means for controlling one of the two important military access routes between the Helvetian territory and the rest of Gaul, blocking passage through the Rh√¥ne valley and the Sundgau. During the following half century, the Helvetii would become increasingly romanized. During this time, there were two settlements near where Aventicum would be founded. The first was the oppidum on Mont Vully between Lake Murten and Lake Neuchatel, which was given up in the 1st century BC. The second was the Bois de Ch√¢tel, which was fortified in the second half of the 1st century BC. The Bois de Ch√¢tel would be destroyed early in the 1st century AD and the population moved to Aventicum. ==Foundation of Aventicum== In the course of Augustus‚Äô reign (27 BC ‚Äì 14 AD), Roman dominance became more concrete. Some of the traditional Celtic oppida were now used as legionary garrisons, or relocated. While the exact date of the founding of Aventicum is not exact, it was likely established during or shortly after Augustus' reign. By 5 AD there was a dock on the shore of Lake Murten, which is the first evidence of a settlement at Aventicum. A grave has also been discovered in the city that dates to 15 AD. During that time there was a small settlement built, in the north east corner of modern Avenches, in the Roman square style. However this site can only be dated to the reign of Tiberius (14 - 37 AD). Aventicum would have grown in 16-17 AD as the Roman legion camp Vindonissa was built in Windisch, Canton Aargau. Aventicum was a major location on the Roman road from Lausanne to Vindonissa. During the reign of Claudius (41 ‚Äì 54 AD) a trade route was completed spanning from Italy to the recently conquered province of Britannia over the Gotthard Pass. This route passed through Aventicum allowing the city to expand. It later became part of Germania Superior and then part of the Diocletian province of Maxima Sequanorum. The former territories of the Helvetii and their inhabitants were, by this time, as romanised as the rest of Gaul. ==Creation of the Helvetii capital== In the 1st century AD Aventicum and the Helvetii land was incorporated into the Roman province of Gallia Belgica. Tacitus, writing about AD. 69, speaks of the Helvetians as originally a Gallic people, renowned for their valour and exploits in war, and he designates Aventicum Caput gentis,Miles (Mar-Aug 1888), 415 Quotes from Tacitus, Hist. 08 or capital of Helvetia. It acquired this title most probably on account of its comparatively advanced state of civilization and its conspicuous position on the main route between Italy and Germany. It was also the centre of a network of well used military roads. Aventicum and Nyon (Colonia Equestris) located on the shores of Lake Geneva were the starting points for all mile-stones in Helvetia. During the first three-quarters of the 1st century AD, Aventicum became a center of the Imperial Cult in the Civitas Helvetiorum. However the Helvetii came into conflict once more with Rome shortly after the death of emperor Nero in 68 AD. Like the other Gallic tribes, the Helvetii were organised as a civitas and enjoyed a certain inner autonomy, including the defence of certain strongholds by their own troops. In the civil war and Year of Four Emperors which followed Nero's death, the civitas Helvetiorum supported Galba; unaware of his death, they refused to accept the authority of his rival, Vitellius. The Legio XXI Rapax, stationed in Vindonissa and favouring Vitellius, stole the pay of a Helvetian garrison, which prompted the Helvetians to intercept the messengers and detain a Roman detachment. Aulus Caecina Alienus, a former supporter of Galba who was now at the head of a Vitellian invasion of Italy, launched a massive punitive campaign, crushing the Helvetii at Mount Vocetius, killing and enslaving thousands. Aventicum was then besieged and quickly surrendered. The city was nearly ordered destroyed by the Romans but owing to the pleas of one Claudius Cossus, a Helvetian envoy to Vitellius, and, as Tacitus puts it, ‚Äúof well-known eloquence‚ÄùTacitus Hist. 1.67-69. the city was spared. ==Raised to a Colonia== During the Year of Four Emperors (69 AD) Vitellius, who nearly ordered Aventicum destroyed, was the third. The fourth, Vespasian, had a much more positive influence on Aventicum. While he was born in Falacrina, in the Sabine country near Reate. His father, Titus Flavius Sabinus, was a banker on a small scale in Aventicum, where Vespasian lived for some time. About two years after Vespasian was declared emperor, he raised Aventicum to the status of a colonia granting exceptional civic status. A colonia was a town that was a specific residential location for legionaries who upon retirement were granted land and became citizens. This encouraged land development and stability and not least the extension of Roman \\"culture\\". Previously, Aventicum had been the capital of a non-citizen nation. The increased prestige that being a colonia brought ushered in a golden age for Aventicum. During this time Aventicum was known as Pia Flavia Constans Emerita. ==Destruction and rediscovery== The Alemanni sacked the city in the 280s, and neither Aventicum nor its hinterland recovered from both the impact of the attack and the subsequent changes of the Roman frontier which no longer granted security to the area. By the collapse of Rome in the 5th century, this area was already fully under the control of Germanic tribes whose dialects became the basis for Swiss German. In the 6th century some Christian life continued in the acropolis of the Roman town- the amphitheatre became a fortress as did the theatre. By the 7th century, however, the focus of the church had moved to Lausanne, Aventicum is only mentioned as an old ruined city though it had fallen into ruins previously. Over the following centuries it is mentioned but always as ruins. In 1710 Marquard Wild was the first to argue that Aveticum had been the capital of Helvetia, and not Antre as was formerly believed. In 1783-86 the Marquess of Northampton led an archeological expedition to Aventicum and in 1788 he put his discoveries on display. His discoveries encouraged many treasure seekers to travel to Aventicum to search for artifacts. In response to the finds, the Mus√©e Vespasien was opened in 1824. In 1838 it was taken over by the Canton of Vaud, renamed the Roman Museum, and installed in the tower of the Amphitheatre. In 1884 the association Pro Aventico was founded with a goal of discovering and preserving the ruins.Avenches L‚ÄôAssociation Pro Aventico accessed 22 January 2009 Aventicum was a well-known location in the Grand Tour and Joseph William Mallord Turner made a drawing of the \\"Cigognier\\", which shows the old town behind. Archaeology benefitted curiously from the first and second world wars when foreigners interned in Switzerland, and local unemployed, were engaged to excavate the main buildings of the Roman city and to renovate and open to the public the theatre, \\"Cigognier\\" and the gates and one tower of the wall. With the advent of the national highway scheme in the late 1960s a programme of rescue archaeology was set up under the association \\"Pro Aventico\\" under the remarkably capable direction of Professor Hans Bogli, after whom the Roman museum has since been named. Early work uncovered the Forum and associated temple area including a possible \\"Capitolium\\". In 1985 during the construction of the A1 highway, further portions of the Roman town were discovered. In 1987 the road was moved to avoid the site. Further and extensive work over the succeeding decades opened up much of the insulae- the rectangular street system of the focus of the Roman town. Much of the area within the walls was not a densely occupied city at all, but rather, like Rome itself, was occupied by \\"urban villas', large houses surrounded by substantial tracts of garden and small-holdings. The more recent work also uncovered a remarkable palace building, much of the centre of the Roman town, and outside the walls a canal and roadway leading from the nearby lake, doubtless assisting in the transport of stone from the Jura by lake and canal, and cemeteries and aqueducts outside the line of the Roman walls. Pro Aventico is also responsible for the constant round of restoration of the buildings opened up in the early part of the 20th century, including sections of the wall and the original Roman tower-raised and protected through its use as a mediaeval watch tower, and the northern gate. Near to the line of the Roman walls, and benefitting from reuse of stone from the walls is the small Romanesque church in Donatyre which possesses excellent early 12th century fresco paintings. == Remains Amphitheatre=== The amphitheatre could hold up to 16,000 people The Amphitheatre, as was common in the Roman Empire, was used for gladiator and animal combat as well as staged hunts. It served political, social and religious purposes and was a central feature of most Roman towns. As the capital city, the amphitheatre in Aventicum was quite large. Entering the arena floor from the monumental east entrance It was built in two stages, first about 130 AD then expanded around 165 AD. The first amphitheatre was built when the hillside was terraced. The arena floor was laid out and flattened. This first structure had 24 rows of seats built mostly of wood rising up the hillside. The stairs, the wall around the arena floor, the upper walls, and the entrances were built of stone. The outer walls of the amphitheatre measured and the arena floor was . The first amphitheatre could hold about 9,000 people.Avenches-Amphitheatre accessed 22 January 2009 The second phase expanded the amphitheatre considerably. A total of 31 rows of stone seats were built, which increased the capacity to about 16,000. The walls were expanded and alcoves were added. On the east side a monumental main portal was built out of massive stone cubes. The expanded amphitheatre was (without the outer courtyard or the east main portal) , while the arena floor remained the same size. The outer walls were high. During the 4th century the amphitheater was abandoned and much of the structure was removed and used as construction material. In the 11th century the Bishop of Lausanne had a tower house built over the east entrance, starting at about the 20th row of benches. This tower is now the home of the Roman Museum. ===Theatre=== The Theatre of Aventicum with the modern town of Avenches in the background The theatre was built during the early 2nd century in an area that was previously occupied by scattered houses. It was rebuilt and renovated numerous times, though details are unclear. In the last third of the 3rd century it was rebuilt as a fortified refuge and a moat was added. It was used for this purpose until the middle of the 4th century.Avenches-Theatre accessed 22 January 2009 Curved shape of the seating and one vomitorium on the upper left The theatre is built in the style of a classical Roman theatre, but does have some Gallo-Roman modifications. Both the Orchestra and the Cavea (spectator seating) are nearly horseshoe shaped. The actual stage is a simple wooden platform. The scaenae frons or background wall had three doors leading to the relatively small () stage building (postscaenium) which is built projecting out behind the wall. The scaenae frons was built with a gap in the wall which showed the Cigognier Temple to the audience. The theatre was used for comedies and tragedies, but there is also a \\"cult niche\\" at the foot of the audience's section with the stage forming an altar. This indicates that the theatre may have also been used for \\"dedicating plays\\" for religious ceremonies. The theatre is wide and deep. The orchestra area is across and deep. The capacity of the theatre was about 12,000 people, with over 50 rows for seating. It was entered through 11 vomitoria (covered entrances) which each had two arched passageways. At the bottom of the spectators seating there was a wide box for the nobility. ===Cigognier Temple=== Cigognier Temple pillars The name of the temple (Cigognier) comes from a stork's nest that had occupied the top of a pillar since at least 1642.Avenches-Cigognier Temple accessed 23 January 2009 The nest was removed during a restoration in 1978, but the name has remained. The Cigognier Temple was built as a massive and impressive temple and may have been the chief temple of the Imperial Cult in the entire civitas Helvetiorum state. At the temple the Roman Empire, symbolized by the divine Emperor, would be worshipped by the citizens and inhabitants of the state. Supporting this theory, a gold bust of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius was found hidden in drains on the site of the temple. Additionally, the temple was laid out in the same manner as the Templum Pacis in Rome. Finally, the temple was built near the Theatre, which also may have had a role in the worship of the Emperor. The temple was started in 98AD, the first year of the reign of Emperor Trajan, according to dendrochronological analysis of the numerous oak posts that support the walls. It appears that the temple wasn't part of the original plan of Aventicum and so it may have been added under the direction of Trajan. Trajan had served with the Roman army along the Rhine, and after his ascension to the throne may have had the temple built to represent his power over the northern reaches of the Empire. The temple was built with a wide inner courtyard with an avenue running along the long axis. The eight pillaredportico of the temple rose high above the north courtyard. The actual temple was built on a high podium with a neighboring seating area hall, with three rows of seats. A wall surrounded the entire complex except toward the south which formed the outer courtyard. The wall had a gate that connected the temple to the Theatre and the new, main east‚Äìwest road in the city. The Cigognier Temple is the largest temple in Aventicum. The outer dimensions were . The temple was , the height of the roof peak was of which is the height of the podium. The hall for the seating area was and the roof height was , also with a podium. The outer courtyard was . ===The Temple of the Grange-des-D√Æmes (2nd century AD)=== The Roman Temple of the Grange-des-D√Æmes dates from the end of the 1st or the early 2nd century. It was built on the site of an earlier 1st-century gallic chapel. The temple is built in a typical Roman fashion, however the cella is nearly square instead of a more rectangular shape. The Temple is raised above the ground on a podium. The cella was surrounded by pillars and the entrance was crowned with a pediment. Inside the temple there was an altar, a fountain and four pillars that supported a canopy over a statue. The temple was, most likely, dedicated to the Gallo-Roman god Mercurius Cissonius, a syncretic combination of Mercury and the gallic god Cissonius. The temple worships Mercury as the god of travellers and trade and being located on the main street through the city would have been visited by both. Its close proximity to the Cigognier Temple, the center of worship for the Imperial Cult, indicates that this temple was also an important one.Avenches-Temple of the Grange-des-D√Æmes accessed 23 January 2009 The temple is partly restored. A section of the foundation of the south wall of the cella, originally , and part of the podium, originally , are visible today. While the stairs leading up the podium are gone, the location of the altar and the fountain as well as the partially reconstructed canopy are also visible on the podium. The rear of the podium is on the north side of the Avenue Jomini. The rest of the temple site is covered by the Avenue, though the floor plan of the temple is laid out in stones embedded in the road. Based on reconstructions, many of the dimensions of the temple are known. The podium was high, with a cella that was about high and covered with a four sided roof. The cella is surrounded by a narrow colonnaded portico facade with pillars that are in diameter, high and the trusses above the pillars were thick. The entrance to the temple was set off with 4 pillars ( in diameter). Roman city wall and east gate Baths at the Forum ===City wall and gates=== The main road through Aventicum ran from east to west. The east gate was built during the reign of Vespasian. The gate was built to protect and control the road before the city walls were built.Avenches-East Gate accessed 23 January 2009 ===Baths=== The Baths (known as Thermen von En Perruet or Baths at the Forum) were located directly east of the Forum of Aventicum. They were built during the expansion to a colony, sometime after 77 AD. They were financed by a wealthy romanized Helvetii family known as the Camilli.Avenches-Baths at the Forum accessed 23 January 2009 ==See also== * Avenches * Colonia (Roman) * Switzerland in the Roman era * List of cities founded by the Romans ==References * Catholic Encyclopedia : St. Marius Aventicus * Roman Museum Aventicum Roman Museum Aventicum (Avenches Tourisme) * Mus√©e Romain Avenches * Map of the city of Aventicum Category:1st-century establishments in Switzerland Category:1st-century establishments in the Roman Empire Category:Ancient Roman theatres in Switzerland Category:Archaeological sites in Switzerland Category:Avenches Category:Former populated places in Switzerland Category:Geography of the canton of Vaud Category:Helvetii Category:History museums in Switzerland Category:Museums in the canton of Vaud Category:Museums of ancient Rome in Switzerland Category:Populated places established in the 1st century Category:Roman towns and cities in Switzerland Category:Roman towns in Germania ","title":"Aventicum"},{"id":"2232547","text":"Eilean Dubh means 'Black Island' in Scottish Gaelic.

She then competed at the 1996 Summer Olympics, finishing 4th with the Chinese team. She recorded the highest score of the entire Olympics on the balance beam, a 9.875 during the team optionals, and in doing so, became the only gymnast to top the 9.862 scored three consecutive times by Olympic balance beam champion Shannon Miller. However, a fall from the beam during the team compulsories (resulting in a score of 8.925) prevented Kui from making the beam finals. She also failed to make the floor exercise final, despite her world title on that event. Kui went on to win two bronze medals at the 1997 World Championships, with her team and on the balance beam. The balance beam result was controversial: Kui performed the most difficult routine of all the competitors in the final‚Äîincluding a full-twisting back layout, as well as three split leaps to a back handspring and two layout step-outs‚Äîbut finished .012 behind Romania's Gina Gogean. She lost the silver medal to Svetlana Khorkina of Russia in a tie-breaker. The results prompted the president of the International Federation of Gymnastics to publicly chastise the judges. The following year, Kui won two gold medals at the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok and two medals at the World Cup Final. In 1999, she had an injury and could not compete. She recovered in time for the 2000 Olympics, where she hoped to win the individual gold medal on the balance beam that eluded her in 1996. However, she injured her knee while vaulting during the preliminary round of competition and could not compete in the finals. She admitted that it was emotionally devastating for her to watch her teammate Liu Xuan take the beam gold. The Chinese team finished 3rd, but the medal was stripped by the International Olympic Committee in 2010 after one of the team members, Dong Fangxiao, was found to have been underage during the competition. == Post- gymnastics life == After retiring from gymnastics, Kui had surgery on her knee. She began studying French at the Beijing University of International Business and Economics, but dropped out after a few semesters. In March 2006, she married her boyfriend of two years, a football player. A year later, she gave birth to a daughter. Kui remains close friends with former teammates Peng Sha (her daughter's godmother) and Bi Wenjing. ==References * Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Chinese female artistic gymnasts Category:World champion gymnasts Category:Medalists at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships Category:Gymnasts at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Gymnasts at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Competitors stripped of Summer Olympics medals Category:Gymnasts from Beijing Category:Asian Games medalists in gymnastics Category:Gymnasts at the 1998 Asian Games Category:Olympic gymnasts of China Category:Asian Games gold medalists for China Category:Asian Games silver medalists for China Category:Medalists at the 1998 Asian Games ","title":"Kui Yuanyuan"},{"id":"2232567","text":"LƒÅƒçplƒìsis is an epic poem by Andrejs Pumpurs, a Latvian poet, who wrote it between 1872 and 1887 based on local legends.

Kangars provokes a war with the Estonians, and LƒÅƒçplƒìsis sets out to fight the giant Kalapuisis ( (the \\"Kalapuisis\\" name is derived from kalapoiss), probably refers to the hero of the Estonian epic poem Kalevipoeg), to win the hand of Laimdota. He defeats the giant, and the two make peace and decide to join forces to fight their common enemy, the German missionaries, led by the priest Dietrich (Dƒ´trihs). LƒÅƒçplƒìsis performs another heroic deed by spending the night in a sunken castle, breaking the curse and allowing the castle to rise into the air again. Laimdota and LƒÅƒçplƒìsis are engaged. In the following episodes, Laimdota reads from the old books about the Creation and ancient Latvian teachings. Laimdota and Koknesis are kidnapped and imprisoned in Germany. Spƒ´dala convinces LƒÅƒçplƒìsis that Laimdota and Koknesis are lovers. LƒÅƒçplƒìsis returns home to LielvƒÅrde, then sets sail for Germany. His ship becomes lost in the Northern Sea, and he is welcomed by the daughter of the North Wind. In the meantime, Dietrich and the Livonian prince Caupo of Turaida meet with the Pope in Rome to plan the Christianization of Latvia. LƒÅƒçplƒìsis begins his dangerous journey home from the Northern Sea. He fights monsters with three, six, and nine heads on the Enchanted Island. Finally, he encounters Spƒ´dala on the island, and frees her from her contract with the Devil. LƒÅƒçplƒìsis is reunited with Laimdota and Koknesis, who escaped from Germany but were then trapped on the Enchanted Island. Koknesis declares his love for Spƒ´dala, and the four friends return to Latvia. A double wedding is celebrated during the JƒÅ≈Üi (Midsummer festivities), but the heroes soon set off to fight the German crusaders. After several battles, the Germans are pushed back, and their leader, Bishop Albert, brings reinforcements from Germany, including the Black Knight. At Dietrich's bidding, Kangars finds out the secret of LƒÅƒçplƒìsis' strength and treacherously reveals it to the Germans: LƒÅƒçplƒìsis' mother was a she-bear, and his superhuman strength resides in his bear ears. The German knights come to LielvƒÅrde offering to make peace. LƒÅƒçplƒìsis organizes a friendly tournament, during which he is goaded into fighting the Black Knight. The knight cuts off LƒÅƒçplƒìsis' ears. LƒÅƒçplƒìsis, still, having not yet completely lost his strength, explodes in anger and lifts the Knight, to throw him in the river from a cliff. But the two combatants fall into Daugava river, because the Knight, when thrown, grabs LƒÅƒçplƒìsis, and they both disappear into the water. In the same moment Laimdota's life ends. ;Canto I: The council of the gods ‚Äì LƒÅƒçplƒìsis' destiny revealed ;Canto II: The first heroic deed of LƒÅƒçplƒìsis ‚Äì LƒÅƒçplƒìsis sets out to Burtnieki castle ‚Äì Meeting with Spƒ´dala ‚Äì In the Devil's pit ‚Äì In Staburadze's palace ‚Äì Return and meeting with Koknesis ;Canto III: The conspiracy of Kangars and Spƒ´dala ‚Äì War with the Estonians ‚Äì The sunken castle ‚Äì The Creation ‚Äì The Latvians tricked by the Christians ;Canto IV: Kaupa in Rome ‚Äì Koknesis and Laimdota in Germany ‚Äì LƒÅƒçplƒìsis in the northern sea ‚Äì LƒÅƒçplƒìsis' return ;Canto V: On the bewitched island ‚Äì Meeting with Spƒ´dala ‚Äì Homecoming ‚Äì LƒÅƒçplƒìsis, Laimdota and Koknesis reunited ;Canto VI: Midsummer festival ‚Äì Battle begins ‚Äì LƒÅƒçplƒìsis' wedding ‚Äì Death of LƒÅƒçplƒìsis ==Contemporary background== From the time of the Northern Crusades in the early 13th century, most of the land in Courland was owned by nobles descended from the German invaders. In 1863, the Russian authorities issued laws to enable Latvians, who formed the bulk of the population, to acquire the farms which they held, and special banks were founded to help them. By this means, some occupants bought their farms, but the great mass of the population remained landless, and lived as hired laborers, occupying a low position in the social scale. This was the situation prevailing at the time of writing ‚Äì thus, the strongly negative presentation of these German invaders had clear contemporary implications for the writer's own time. ==See also== *Latvian mythology *LƒÅƒçplƒìsis (rock opera) *Laimdota (given name) *Order of LƒÅƒçplƒìsis *Latvian War of Independence *Latvian literature *LƒÅƒçplƒì≈°a Day ==Further reading== * Guntis Smidchens, \\"National Heroic Narratives in the Baltics as a Source for Nonviolent Political Action,\\" Slavic Review 66,3 (2007), 484‚Äì508. * Kruks, Sergei. 2004. ‚ÄúThe Latvian epic LƒÅƒçplƒìsis: Passe-partout ideology, traumatic imagination of community.‚Äù Journal of Folklore Research 41(1): 1‚Äì32. ==External links== *Full text of LƒÅƒçplƒìsis *Verse translation from Project Gutenberg *The Bear Slayer Category:Epic poems Category:Latvian literature ","title":"LƒÅƒçplƒìsis"},{"id":"2232570","text":" The North American Aviation NA-16 was the first trainer aircraft built by North American Aviation, and was the beginning of a line of closely related North American trainer aircraft that would eventually number more than 17,000 examples. ==Design and development== First NA-16 with initial canopy and still in civilian registration. On 10 December 1934, James Howard \\"Dutch\\" Kindelberger, John L. \\"Lee\\" Atwood, and H.R. Raynor sketched out the specifications for the NA-16. A key characteristic for the advanced trainer was a closed canopy. The NA-16 is a family of related single-engine, low-wing monoplanes with tandem seating.Hagedorn 1997, p. 4. Variants could have an open cockpit (the prototype and the NA-22) or be under a glass greenhouse that covered both cockpits.Hagedorn 1997, pp. 20‚Äì21. On some variants, the rear of the canopy could be opened for a gunner to fire to the rear.Hagedorn 1997, p. 21. A variety of air-cooled radial engines, including the Wright Whirlwind, Pratt & Whitney Wasp and Pratt & Whitney Wasp Junior of varying horsepowers, could be installed depending on customer preferences.Hagedorn 1997, pp. 6‚Äì7. The fuselage was built up from steel tubes and normally fabric covered; however, later versions were provided with aluminium monocoque structures.Hagedorn 1997, p. 12. During the development of the design, a six- inch stretch was made by moving the rudder post aft.Hagedorn 1997, p. 53. Many versions had a fixed landing gear, but later versions could have retractable gear, mounted in a widened wing center section (which could have either integral fuel tanks or not).Hagedorn 1997, p. 61. Most had a straight trailing edge on the outer wing while again, some had the wing trailing edge swept forward slightly in an attempt to fix a problem with stalls and spins.Hagedorn 1997, pp. 14, 19. Several different rudders were used, with early examples having a round outline, intermediate examples having a square bottom on the rudder (Harvard I) and late examples using the triangular rudder of the AT-6 series, due to a loss of control at high angles of attack with the early types.Hagedorn 1997, p. 19. Horizontal and vertical tails were initially covered in corrugated aluminum, but later examples were smooth-skinned, and the horizontal stabilizer was increased in chord near its tips on later versions.Hagedorn 1997, pp. 14‚Äì15. The NA-16 flew for the first time on 1 April 1935, by Eddie Allen. An enclosed cockpit version of the NA-16 was submitted to the United States Army Air Corps for performance tests as a basic trainer on 27 May 1935.Hagedorn 1997, p. 8. The Army accepted the trainer for production but with some detail changes, including a larger engine and faired landing gear modifications. The modified NA-16 was redesignated by North American as the NA-18, with production examples entering Air Corps service as the North American BT-9 (NA-19). The U.S. Army Air Corps ordered 42 BT-9s, equipped with the Wright R-975 Whirlwind engine, and 40 BT-9As, which could be armed with .30 cal. Browning M-1 machine guns. In 1936, an order was placed for 117 BT-9Bs, without armament. A total of 67 BT-9Cs (NA-29) were built, using the same R-975-7 engine. Similar aircraft continued to be sold outside the U.S. under the NA-16 designation.Hagedorn 1997, p. 15. By the time of the U.S. entry into WWII, the NAF had built 1631 N-16 series aircraft. Of that total, 1043 were for foreign countries, while the remainder were for the U.S. Army Air Corps and Navy. === Foreign developments === ;Australia The Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation produced 755 units of a modified version of the NA-16-2K (NA-33) known there as the Wirraway between 1939 and 1946. The units built included 40 CA-1s (Wirraway I), 60 CA-3s, 32 CA-5s, 100 CA-7s, 200 CA-8s, 188 CA-9s, and 135 CA-16s. The CA-16s were called the Wirraway IIIs, while previous models were called Wirraway IIs. ;Argentina Experience with the NA-16-4P and deteriorating political relations with the US led to the local development of the I.Ae. D.L. 21, which shared the NA-16 fuselage structure; however it proved too difficult to produce. As a result of this, an entirely new design (the I.Ae. D.L. 22) was built instead; it had similar configuration, but was structurally different and optimized to available materials.von Rauch, Georg and David L. Veres. \\"Argentina's Wooden Warriors\\". Air Classics (Challenge Publications), Volume 19, March 1983, pp. 14‚Äì21. ;Japan The NA-16-4RW and NA-16-4R inspired the development of the Kyushu K10W when the Imperial Japanese Navy instructed Kyushu to develop something similar.Starkings, Peter. \\"From American Acorn to Japanese Oak\\". Arawasi (Asahi Process, Tokyo), Issue 7, 2007, pp. 26‚Äì31. Retrieved: 8 September 2011. The resulting aircraft owed little to the NA-16, however Allied Intelligence saw so few examples that the error was not corrected and some drawings show a modified NA-16. ==Variants== North American BT-9 Listing includes aircraft built specifically under NA-16 designation for export, and similar aircraft built for use by the United States armed forces. ;NA-16 :One for United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) (trials) developed into NA-18 and BT-9 series. :powered by Wright R-975 Whirlwind When the North American NA-16 was first conceived, five different roles were intended for the design, designated NA-16-1 thru NA-16-5:Hagedorn 1997, p. 7. ;NA-16-1:General purpose two-seat aircraft - which became the Harvard IHagedorn 1997, p. 41. ;NA-16-2:Two-seat fighter - produced under licence in Australia as the CAC Wirraway.Smith 2000, p. 96. ;NA-16-3:Two-seat light attack bomber.

The fabric-covered fuselage was replaced by an all-metal monocoque to create the NA-44,Hagedorn 1997, pp. 37‚Äì38. which provided the basis for a line of light attack bombers whose improvements would result in the AT-6.Hagedorn 1997, p. 46. ;NA-16-4:Advanced trainer - became the BT-9 for the USAAC and which provided the bulk of early production.

It was the first reported commercial natural gas discovery in Ireland since the Kinsale Head gas field was discovered in 1971. The first appraisal well was drilled in 1997. A number of consents and approvals to develop the Corrib Project were issued in 2001. In 2002, Enterprise Oil was acquired by Royal Dutch Shell who took over the operatorship of the project. Development of the project began in 2004, but it was delayed in 2005 when locals opposed the project. Shell announced the suspension of the project to facilitate further discussions with opposing parties. For a year, independent safety reviews were conducted to address various safety concerns in relation to the project. In 1999, Saga Petroleum became a part of a Norsk Hydro and in 2007 a part of Statoil. In July 2009, Vermilion Energy acquired Marathon Oil's stake in the project. Until 2018, Royal Dutch Shell was the operator of the project with a 45% ownership stake. In 2018, Shell sold its share of the project to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board; as part of the transaction, Vermilion Energy became the project's operator and expanded its ownership share to 20%. ==Development== Royal Dutch Shell proposed to develop the Corrib field as a sub-sea production facility with onshore processing. This method of development is claimed by Shell to be in line with best industry practice for gas fields of this type. The project includes development of offshore operations including the wells and subsea facilities, construction of offshore and onshore pipelines, and construction of onshore processing plant at Bellanaboy. ===Gas field=== The Corrib gas field is located about off Erris Head in County Mayo in an area known as the Slyne Trough in water depths of . The gas is originating from Triassic Sandstone reservoir below the seabed. Reserves in the field are believed to be about , 70% the volume of the Kinsale field. The natural gas in the Corrib Gas Field is a very pure form of gas, consisting of approximately 97% methane and ethane. The Corrib gas does not contain hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide makes up only 0.3% of the total amount of gas. The subsea production system is delivered by VetcoGray, an ABB Company. Production at the gas field will be remotely controlled from the Bellanaboy Bridge terminal. There are five production wells at the Corrib field drilled by Transocean Sedco 711 semi- submersible drilling rig. When in operation, each well is planned to have a so-called \\"christmas tree\\" structure above it that contains all control and monitoring equipment. Flexible individual flowlines will run from each well to a production manifold which will feed the gas into the main pipeline. There is no production platform installed in the field. ===Pipeline=== The pipeline from the Corrib field to the landfall at Glengad is planned to be approximately 90 km in length. The pipeline has a diameter of and it will operate at pressures of . Work on the offshore section occurred in summer 2009 and involved over 7,000 lengths of pipe being welded together on board the Solitaire pipelaying vessel. The onshore pipeline is still in the proposal phase but is expected to be some in length and run from landfall to the drying plant. ===Processing plant=== Gas will be processed at the processing plant inland near Bellanaboy Bridge. The purpose of the plant is to dry the gas and remove impurities. The plant has a capacity of 10 million standard cubic metres of purified gas per day. Processed gas will be fed to the Bord G√°is gas grid. The piping for the Onshore Processing Plant is manufactured by Phoenix Pipes Limited in Slane, Co. Meath. ==Controversy== Garda√≠ guard the Bellanaboy terminal site from occupation by protesters Some opponents of the scheme cite concerns about the health, safety and environmental impact of the onshore aspects of the project. Others are concerned with alleged irregularities and precedents surrounding the project. Many groups, most notably the Rossport Five and Shell to Sea campaigns, oppose the current plans for the project, which they regard as dangerous despite assurances from Shell. http://www.vimeo.com/8668733 A contrary position is taken by the group Pro Gas Mayo. A film about the project, The Pipe was released on 8 July 2010 at the Galway Film Festival.The Pipe thepipethefilm.com ===Safety and environmental concerns=== Pipeline route The upstream high pressure gas pipeline that will connect the wells to the inland processing site is planned to run through the area of Rossport, close to local residences. A report by Dr. Richard Kupriewicz concluded that \\"the terrain makes escape routes for the clustered population essentially impossible in the event of a [pipeline] rupture\\". Discharges from drying process Broadhaven Bay is the proposed area to discharge waste from the refining process ===Planning problems=== Planning permission was initially refused by the board of An Bord Plean√°la (the Irish planning authority). Senior planning inspector Kevin Moore‚Äôs report stated in part: \\"[I]t is my submission that the proposed development of a large gas processing terminal at this rural, scenic, and unserviced area on a bogland hill some 8 kilometres inland from the Mayo coastland landfall location, with all its site development works difficulties, public safety concerns, adverse visual, ecological, and traffic impacts, and a range of other significant environmental impacts, defies any rational understanding of the term ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù.\\" In November 2009, An Bord Plean√°la ordered Shell to redesign the pipeline and move its route away from homes saying it posed an \\"unacceptable risk\\". ==Tax== Claims of a tax yield of some ‚Ç¨1.7 billion over the life of the field have been made by the Irish government based on data about the field's size and 2008 gas prices. Up to 2007, the Irish Petroleum Licensing Terms imposed a flat 25% income tax on gas production revenues. In August 2007, the top rate of tax on the most profitable fields was increased to 40%. The new licensing terms called for changes to the tax imposed based upon fields ' profit ratios (equal to the rate of profit less 25% divided by the accumulated level of capital investment). Where this ratio is greater than 4.5, an additional 15% tax was imposed, where it is between 3.0 and 4.5 an additional 10% was imposed and where the profit ratio is between 1.5 and 3.0, and additional 5% tax was added. Less profitable fields were not affected. ==Employment== The construction of the pipeline and plant was expected by Shell's economic consultants, Goodbody Economic Consultants, to create 800 temporary jobs and boost the local Mayo economy by approximately ‚Ç¨181 million. The plant was expected by Shell to employ approximately 55 workers when operational. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== * Trailer for 'The Pipe' released 8 July 2010 - Galway Film Festival * 'Pipe Down' film - winner - Waterford Film Festival 2010 *Project Website *Corrib Gas Pipeline *Project Overview and History *Centre For Public Inquiry's review of events surrounding the Corrib gas project *Technical details of proposed pipeline from Accufacts Inc. *Mayo Gas Info *Advantica's review of onshore pipeline *Bitter dispute over gas pipeline -- BBC news article on controversy Category:Corrib gas controversy Category:Geography of County Mayo Category:Natural gas fields in Ireland Category:Politics of County Mayo Category:Royal Dutch Shell oil and gas fields ","title":"Corrib gas project"},{"id":"2232603","text":" USS Cascade (AD-16), the only ship of its class, was a destroyer tender in the United States Navy. Originally designed as a passenger-freighter, the Cascade was launched on 6 June 1942 by Western Pipe and Steel Company in San Francisco, California. The ship was sponsored by Mrs. Charles W. Crosse, wife of Rear Admiral Charles W. Crosse, USN. It was turned over to the Matson Navigation Company of San Francisco, California, for outfitting in October 1942. The Cascade was commissioned on 12 March 1943, Captain S. B. Ogden in command. ==Service history1943‚Äì1944=== Cascade cleared San Francisco on 12 June 1943 for Pearl Harbor, where she began her war time duty of tending destroyers. As the war moved westward, Cascade followed, bringing her support close to the action areas. From November 1943, she was stationed successively at Kwajalein, Eniwetok, and Ulithi, while the ships she served ranged the Pacific, escorting convoys, screening carrier task forces, supporting invasions, and carrying out many other tasks with typical destroyer versatility. Cascade was part of Service Squadron 10. In June 1945, Cascade sailed to Okinawa, where she endured the suicide raids and typhoon weather. She left Okinawan waters in September to serve in Wakayama, Japan and later at Tokyo, Japan, supporting the occupation until March 1946, when she sailed for the East Coast. Cascade was decommissioned and placed in service in reserve at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 12 February 1947. In the autumn of 1943 Admiral Nimitz ordered the creation of two service squadrons. These two squadrons would provide mobile service to the fleet as it moved across the Pacific ‚Äî with one service as fleet base while the second remained to the rear. As the fleet captured new sites the rear squadron would move to the front and act as fleet base. Service Squadron 4 was commissioned on 1 November 1943. The squadron was made up of 24 vessels and would be based in Funafuti Atoll. The USS Cascade, Captain Samuel Ogden, was the flagship for the squadron and Captain Ogden was also chief staff officer for the Squadron. The repair ships and and 21 other ships comprised the squadron. On 21 November 1943 the Cascade arrived at Funafuti where she remained until February 1944. During the stay at Funafuti the Cascade serviced numerous fleet vessels ‚Äî including 10 destroyers and eight destroyer escorts. During this period Captain Worrall Reed Carter (USNA 1908), was organizing the second service squadron. Service Squadron 10 was commissioned on 15 January 1944 at Pearl Harbor. After the capture of Kwajalein in February 1944 the Cascade moved from Funafuti to Kwajalein. On 17 March 1944 Squadron 4 was absorbed into Squadron 10. Captain Herbert Meyer Scull (USNA 1919,) was reassigned as Chief of Staff for Rear Admiral Hoover, Commander Forward Area, Central Pacific. Captain Samuel Ogden in the Cascade became representative \\"A\\" of Commander Service Squadron 10 in command of Kwajalein and Roi. The Cascade remained at Kwajalein until May 1944 when she moved to Eniwetok. On 5 June Commodore Carter joined SERVRON 10 at Eniwetok. His flagship was the . The following ships were also present in July 1944: destroyer tenders Cascade, , and ; repair ship ; repair ship landing craft ; floating dry-docks ARD-13, ARD-15; mobile floating dry-dock AFD-15; and floating workshop YR-30. During July 1944 there were a large number of vessels present at Eniwetok. The daily average of ships present during the first half of July was 488; during the second half of July the daily average number of ships at Eniwetok was 283. By the end of July Commodore Carter flew to Pearl Harbor to participate in planning the move of Servron 10 facilities from Eniwetok to Ulithi. ===Ulithi=== On 4 October 1944 Service Squadron 10 began leaving Eniwetok for Ulithi. On 8 October 1944 Commodore Worrall R. Carter's flagship the Prairie, the merchant ammunition ship Plymouth Victory and the Cascade, Captain Herbert Kenneth Gates (USNA 1924), sailed for Ulithi. The Markab initially remained at Eniwetok, leaving for Ulithi on 18 October 1944 and arriving on 22 October. Service Squadron 10's conversion of the lagoon at Ulithi to a major naval resupply and staging area was one of the most remarkable feats of the war. On 20 November 1944 the Ulithi harbor was attacked by Japanese kaiten human torpedoes launched from two nearby submarines. The destroyer rammed one in the early morning hours. At 5:47 the fleet oiler , at anchor in the harbor, was struck and sunk. Destroyers began dropping depth charges throughout the anchorage. At 6:25 the cruiser reported that a torpedo had passed under its bow. The destroyer escorts , , and performed an anti-submarine attack in response to the torpedo attack and reported that an enemy submarine was sunk. Another enemy submarine was sunk by an air attack some 15 miles east of Ulithi. There were two explosions on the reef which indicated the presence of additional kaiten. After the war Japanese naval officers said that two tender submarines each carrying four manned torpedoes had been sent to attack the fleet at Ulithi. Three of the suicide torpedoes were unable to launch due to mechanical problems and another ran aground on the reef. Two did make it into the lagoon, one of which sank the Mississinewa. Following operations at Leyte, Task Force 38 arrived at Ulithi on 24 December. Damaged ships from the force had preceded the main fleet by a few days. The repair ship had begun work on the and ; the Hector was repairing the ; the destroyer was tied up to the Prairie for repairs; the Cascade had the alongside; the was repairing the . On 4 March 1945 the destroyers and collided while conducting night battle drills while en route to Ulithi as part of Task Group 58.1. Ringgold's bow was sheared off to frame 22 and she was extensively damaged to frame 26 port and 38 starboard. Yarnall's bow was bent to the right and upward; her bow broke off and sank during towing. Upon arrival at Ulithi the Ringgold went alongside the Cascade for installation of a temporary bow. In early April the Ringgold departed for Pearl Harbor for permanent repairs and the Yarnall left for Mare Island Navy Yard. On 13 March 1945 there were 647 ships at anchor at Ulithi and with the arrival of amphibious forces staging at Ulithi for the invasion of Okinawa the number of ships at anchor peaked at 722. During the preparations for the Okinawa invasion the service load on Squadron 10 was extremely heavy. On 8 March 1944 the Commander Service Squadron 10 created the Mobile Fleet Motion Picture Sub- Exchange No. 1. The Prairie operated the north exchange and the Cascade operated a branch exchange to service ships in the southern anchorage of Ulithi. The program issued 100 35-mm films and 652 16-mm films per day during December 1944. ===Court of Inquiry=== In December 1944 a court of inquiry was held in the wardroom of the Cascade, at Ulithi, regarding the loss of three ships and over 800 men from the US Third Fleet during a typhoon. The Third Fleet was under the command of William F. (Bull) Halsey, Jr. during the typhoon in mid-December 1944. Admiral Chester A. Nimitz, CINCPAC, was in attendance at the court. Forty-three-year-old Captain Herbert K. Gates, of the Cascade, was the Judge Advocate for the court. Gates was an expert in mechanical and marine engineering. ===Mediterranean, 1951‚Äì1974=== Recommissioned on 5 April 1951, Cascade was based in Newport, Rhode Island, as tender for the many destroyers home-ported there. From Newport she cruised to the Caribbean and the Mediterranean to support the destroyers deployed there. During this time Cascade served as flagship, and carried the flag of Commander, Service Force, 6th Fleet, and the flag of Commander, Destroyer Flotilla 6. She also served as flagship for Commander, Destroyer Force, Atlantic. She served in this role as flagship and tender up through 1963. From 1970 to 1974, the Cascade was forward deployed to the Mediterranean, homeported in Naples Italy. When was in the port of Naples Cascade was used even like a set for a scene of Italian Movie Polvere di stelle in 1973 with Alberto Sordi, Monica Vitti and John Phillip Law. ===Decommissioning and sale=== The Cascade was decommissioned on 22 November 1974 and struck from the Naval Register on 23 November 1974. She was subsequently sold for scrap to Luria Brother of Brooklyn, New York, and dismantled at the Gulmar Yard in Brownsville, Texas starting September 1975. The anchor, along with mooring cleats at the front entrance of the school, ended up at Danville High School in Danville, KY. The anchor has become a symbol of stability and security to all Danville Admirals. It keeps school spirit from drifting and stands as a constant reminder of Admiral tradition. The anchor has been on loan from the Navy to DHS since it was placed. ==Awards== Cascade received one battle star for World War II service. ==Commanding officers== * Captain Samuel Burr Ogden commissioning - May 1944 * Captain Herbert Kenneth Gates May 1944 - 24 December 1945 * Captain Louis T.

February 18, 1901 in Warsaw - 1944 in Majdanek) was a Polish Scoutmaster (harcmistrz), Polish Army officer and member of the Polish resistance during the Second World War. ==Biography== Skorupka was born to a modest civil-servant family. After completing primary school, he attended the Chrzanowski Gymnasium, where on 2 July 1914 he joined the secret Tadeusz Reytan Scout Chapter (also known as 2 WDH); soon he went on his first scout camp. In the summer of 1915, the town of Warsaw was evacuated. Skorupka and his family left to Russia, to the town of Kli≈Ñce, near Homel. There he joined a Scouting unit secretly organised by Polish evacuees. Between 1916 and 1917, he took part in two Scout camps. In 1918, Kazimierz returned to Poland alone. He then studied at the Konarski Technical School, where he joined 10 WDH and achieved the rank of \\"Scout\\" (wywiadowca). In August 1920, Skorupka was mobilised. In December of that year, he founded the 1st Kamionkowska Scouting Chapter in Groch√≥w, which was joined by a platoon from 32 WDH, under the command of Janek Makowski. On 6 May 1921, the group was assigned the number \\"22\\" (which is the traditional number of the first Scouting Chapter in Groch√≥w, founded in 1915 by Stefan Miko≈Çajewski), as well as the patron Wladislaus the Short. Skorupka remained with 22 WDH for the remainder of his life. In 1938 he was awarded the \\"Silver Cross of Merit\\" (Srebrny Krzy≈º Zas≈Çugi), for social work carried out under the Scouts. When the war broke out in 1939, he organised the Scouts from Praga (a quarter of Warsaw) for service on the \\"Scout War Medical Services\\" (Pogotowie Wojenne Harcerzy), also directing the \\"Scout Communication Services\\" (harcerska s≈Çu≈ºba ≈ÇƒÖczno≈õci). For his part in the defence of Warsaw, he was awarded the \\"Cross of Bravery\\" (Krzy≈º Walecznych). From the start of the occupation, Skorupka was the \\"spiritual leader\\", so to say, of the \\"Cospiratory Scouts\\" (konspiracyjne harcerstwo), the Szare Szeregi (Grey Ranks) from Praga. He proceeded to adopt his prewar nickname - Dziad (\\"Old man\\") - as his codename. Skorupka then became completely absorbed with the resistance work, and he became the communications liaison to the commander of the \\"Home Army‚Äôs\\" Praga division. His ordinary job as a tram driver helped to cover his organisational work. When asked by Stanis≈Çaw \\"Orsza\\" Broniewski (successor of Naczelnik Szarych Szereg√≥w) about how many Scouts there were in Praga, Skorupka replied that there were 3,000. When asked on what basis he arrived at that figure, he replied: \\"All I have to do is whistle and 3,000 boys will assemble themselves on the corner of Targowa and Zamoyskiego St. That is how many were in the Praga Chapter on 1 September 1939, nothing has changed here!\\". In reality, the actual number was far smaller. On 17 August 1942, Skorupka was arrested by the Gestapo, having managed to inform those closest to him that the Nazis knew about his conspiratory activities. He nonetheless resisted the Gestapo‚Äôs interrogation, and did not reveal the names of his co-conspirators. In early 1943, Skorupa was taken to a concentration camp in Majdanek. One of the last traces he left were documents confirming his arrival at the camp - which are currently found in the concentration camp's museum - on a list of prisoners kept by the camp‚Äôs resistance section. On this list, he is noted under number 273: \\"Kazimierz Skorupka, born 18 February 1908, son of Adam and Elenor\\". The second trace of the last days of Kazimierz Skorupka are the testimonies of former prisoners who describe someone whose profile fits that of Skorupka. He was classified as a political prisoner and was often taken for interrogation. He would be taken in the mornings and return in the evenings, having been beaten, his health degrading progressively. One evening, he did not return to the prisoners‚Äô barracks. In August, 1944 Kazimierz Skorupka posthumously received a second \\"Cross of Bravery\\" (Krzy≈º Walecznych), being promoted to \\"Second Lieutenant\\". ==References== Category:1901 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Polish Army officers Category:Polish resistance members of World War II Category:Polish Scouts and Guides Category:People who died in Majdanek concentration camp Category:Military personnel who died in Nazi concentration camps Category:Polish military personnel killed in World War II ","title":"Kazimierz Skorupka"},{"id":"2232610","text":"Curtis Lovell II in chains, being locked in a box filled with water by assistant A predicament escape is any form of magic trick or escapology stunt in which the performer is trapped in an apparently dangerous situation and is required to escape from it. Classic examples include the Table of Death, Houdini's Chinese Water Torture Cell, Princess Tenko's escape from an exploding boat and the Upside Down Suspended Straitjacket escape, in which a performer is suspended high in the air from a burning rope. While many such feats are pure and simple escape acts performed for real, the predicament escape is also employed as a set-up or theme for certain illusions. These can end either with the performer emerging from the escape prop or appearing magically at another point in the performance space. Examples include a trick in which Melinda Saxe escaped from a tank filled with snakes during the 1998 television special The World's Most Dangerous Magic and a performance in the sequel show the following year in which the magician Margo was shackled in a coffin filled with rats and escaped to re-appear from behind the audience. When performed by a female artist, these types of stunts sometimes involve aspects of the damsel in distress archetype, although with the damsel rescuing herself rather than waiting for a hero to come to her aid. == \\"Escape gone wrong\\" == One sub-variant, sometimes known as \\"escape gone wrong\\" tricks, are presented initially as escape acts but then appear to go wrong, giving the audience the impression the performer must have been killed or badly injured. The artist uses illusion techniques to re-appear unharmed. The Table of Death is sometimes classified in this way. Another example is a stunt performed by Paul Daniels in which he was placed in a crate in the path of a race car, later emerging as the driver of the car after it had smashed through the crate. The Drill of Death illusion can also be presented as an \\"escape gone wrong\\". Another variant on the \\"escape gone wrong\\" illusion ends without the performer re-appearing. Such a trick was performed by Paul Daniels on the halloween edition of his BBC television show in 1987. He was chained up in an iron maiden type device where a set of spikes were set to close on him after a timer ran out. The broadcast showed the spikes closing on him before he had appeared and then the titles rolled. It was only revealed later that he was alright and the intended effect of the trick had been to shock viewers. == Cabinet escape == The cabinet escape is the classic escapology trick, where the magician is trapped in a cabinet and required to escape from it. Often, the magician can be bound in handcuffs, rope and sacks before being placed in the cabinet. A cabinet escape involves the audience seeing the person come out of the cabinet unassisted. == References == Category:Escapology Category:Magic tricks ","title":"Predicament escape"},{"id":"2232611","text":"The Southern African Catholic Bishops' Conference (SACBC) is an episcopal conference consisting of all the bishops of the Roman Catholic Church in South Africa, Botswana, and Swaziland, and their equivalents under canon law (apostolic vicars, apostolic administrators, etc.).

Lin Li started gymnastics when she entered elementary school in 1993. By 2002, Lin Li was selected for the National Team. Since joining the national team, Lin has competed at many prestigious championships such as the 2003 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, 2004 Olympics and 2004 World Cup Final. Lin Li is the 2003 National Champion on the uneven bars as well as a two time national bronze medalist on floor exercise. ==Life after and during the Olympics== Lin Li was chosen for the 2004 Olympics because the coaches felt certain that Lin could bring home an individual medal on the uneven bars. After the preliminary rounds Lin was second on the uneven bars. She outscored both Li Ya and Fan Ye by earning a 9.7. Lin also earned the highest score on the uneven bars during the Team Finals. Unfortunately, Lin felt a lot of pressure in medaling on the uneven bars after the Chinese WAG and MAG teams failed to medal during the team competition. With the added pressure on top of the usual nerves, Lin watered down her routine and failed to medal during the uneven bars final. After the Olympics, Lin was not chosen for any Grand Prix events, but competed at the 2004 World Cup Final on the uneven bars and finished 6th. After a disappointing year in 2004, Lin also failed to win any medals at the 2005 Chinese National Championships. Many critics felt that Lin Li's career was over. Some even went as far as saying she would never compete internationally again. Lin Li proved her critics wrong and was last seen competing at the 2005 Australia VS China Dual Meet. She finished 5th in the all around and 1st on the uneven bars. Unfortunately, she fractured her hand during warm-ups on the uneven bars at the dual meet. She continued to train on the other three events. In October, she helped the Guizhou provincial team to a sixth-place finish at the Tenth National Games, competing watered-down routines on the vault, uneven bars, and balance beam. Shortly after the Games, she returned to her home province and retired. In the fall of 2006, she entered the Beijing University of Physical Education. ==External links== * *Lin Li's photos at GymBox Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:Chinese female artistic gymnasts Category:Gymnasts at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Gymnasts from Guizhou Category:Olympic gymnasts of China ","title":"Lin Li (gymnast)"},{"id":"2232689","text":"The detachable thumb (unknown originator) is a close-up illusion. ==Effect== The performer appears to remove the end of his own thumb; moving it back and forth along his hand or lifting it up. ==Method== There is no particular secret to this illusion: the performer simply holds out one hand sideways with the palm out and the tip of the thumb folded down behind the hand.

Formed in Stockholm by childhood friends Adam Olenius (vocals), Ted Malmros (bass), and Carl von Arbin (guitars), Shout Out Louds found an international audience during the early 2000s with their peppy Swedish pop. The lineup began taking shape in 2001, with drummer Eric Edman and keyboardist Bebban Stenborg climbing aboard shortly thereafter. Shout Out Louds wasted little time writing songs, the first three of which formed the basis of their first demo tape. The music caught the ear of Filip Wil√©n, owner of Sweden's Bud Fox Recordings, and he quickly signed the group to his label. Shout Out Louds then spent the majority of 2002 writing more songs, and December found them recording their debut EP, 100¬∞, which was released in 2003. The group's high-energy, ultra- melodic sound was in place from the very beginning. The band toured Sweden and Scandinavia in support of 100¬∞, whose release was followed by two singles, \\"Hurry Up Let's Go\\" and \\"Shut Your Eyes.\\" In October 2003, the group released its first album, Howl Howl Gaff Gaff, to great acclaim in Sweden. The band spent the following year touring, releasing additional material (\\"Please Please Please,\\" \\"Very Loud/Wish I Was Dead,\\" and the Oh, Sweetheart EP), and inking an American deal with Capitol Records. The U.S. version of Howl Howl Gaff Gaff was released in May 2005, featuring songs from the Swedish release plus some early singles and EP tracks. A tour of the U.S. with indie darlings the Dears helped boost the band's profile, as did airplay on The O.C. Despite such growing success, the band's 2007 album \\"Our Ill Wills\\" produced by Bj√∂rn Yttling was a somber, melancholy affair, replete with icy synths and Cure- inspired vocals. Another round of tour dates kept the bandmates busy until mid-2008, at which point they decided to take a half-year hiatus. March 2009 found the musicians reconvening in Stockholm to write new material, and by August the band had decamped to Seattle to begin recording with producer Phil Ek. Their third album, Work, arrived in early 2010. After coming home from a tour to support the album, the band members felt that a change in the way they worked was in order. Hoping to recapture the more relaxed spirit of earlier recordings, they spent time outside the studio composing the songs, with each band member responsible for coming up with their own parts. When they came back together, the band produced their next record themselves (with help from Johannes Berglund) in a small Stockholm studio. Optica was released by Merge in early 2013. The next few years saw a handful of solo releases from both Olenius and from Stenborg's Astropol project. Regrouping in Stockholm, the Shout Out Louds returned with 2017's more guitar-oriented Ease My Mind. ==Band members== * Adam Olenius - vocals, guitar * Ted Malmros - bass, percussion, backing vocals * Carl von Arbin - guitar, backing vocals * Eric Edman - drums * Bebban Stenborg - occasional lead vocals, keyboards, accordion, glockenspiel, moog, backing vocals ==DiscographyStudio albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !

It was released in 1994 for PCs operating DOS, with subsequent Macintosh and Microsoft Windows releases in 1995 and 1996. It was one of the first games to bring the side-scrolling platformer style‚Äîcommon on gaming consoles‚Äîto a PC audience. On November 30, 2017 the game was re-released on GOG.com along with Jazz Jackrabbit 2, with support for Windows, macOS, and Linux. ==Plot== The game is set in a fantasy world based on Aesop's \\"The Tortoise and the Hare\\", in which the enmity between tortoises and hares continues even after three thousand years. An evil mastermind tortoise named Devan Shell begins conquering planets, suppressing any native confrontation. One of such planets, Carrotus, is home to a peaceful hare kingdom that, once confronted by Shell, is able to provide enough resistance to fend him off. Enraged by his loss, Devan decides to kidnap Carrotus princess Eva Earlong and hide her on a distant airbase of unknown location to weaken the hares. In response, the king chooses to send Carrotus' hero Jazz Jackrabbit, who carries a blue LFG-2000 gun, to various planets conquered by Devan that might contain clues to the location of Eva's imprisonment. As Jazz travels through different worlds, he gains new weapons and meets new enemies in his pursuit to rescue the princess and save Carrotus from Devan Shell and his army of Turtle Terrorists. Jazz is depicted as a bright green jackrabbit with a red bandana, bracers and a blue \\"blaster\\" gun. ==Gameplay== In-game screenshot showing Jazz shooting at an enemy on Diamondus level, while profiting from temporary invincibility depicted by a field of yellow stars The game is divided into six episodes. Each episode has three planets (worlds), with every planet itself consisting of two levels (some planets have an additional secret level). The final level of every episode features a boss that the player must deal with in order to complete the level. Episodes are tied by a single storyline usually progressing after each episode is finished. Gameplay mechanics in Jazz are very similar to Zool's, with the exception of not being able to destroy the enemies by simply jumping at them (which was not added until the second game). Jazz will run faster and jump higher the longer he runs, avoiding chasms that might lead to harmful objects. Unlike other platform games, however, there are no abysses and every level bifurcates into subsections that might lead to valuable items (such as weapon pick-ups, score items, etc.) while the direction of general progression is hinted at with occasional arrows. Jazz has a life bar that changes in colour based on how much health Jazz has remaining. Jazz can withstand a limited number of hits (5 on Easy mode, 4 on Medium mode, 3 on Hard or Turbo mode) from harmful objects before losing a life; one hit's worth of health can be restored by picking up a carrot. Lives can also be accumulated to the maximum number of ten. When killed, Jazz starts from the level beginning or at any checkpoint sign that had been reached and shot before. Items that the player can pick up usually resemble food, computer hardware components or other familiar shapes, and give 100 score points each. There are also several beneficial pick-ups in the game: a \\"force shield\\" that protects Jazz from one or four hits, a sidekick in form of a bird that shoots enemies, a hoverboard that allows flight, rapid fire/super jump bonuses, a temporary \\"speed-up\\" and invincibility, as well as extra lives. Weapons also vary in numbers and consistency and include (besides the initial blaster) bouncing launcher grenades, flame bullets, bi-missile projectiles and TNT sets. Large sets of ammunition can only be collected by being shot from their enclosure. The first game features a timer that starts a number of minutes at the beginning of each level (9 minutes 59 seconds on Easy mode, 8 minutes on Medium, 6 minutes on Hard, and 4 minutes on Turbo) and counts down to zero; on Hard and Turbo, another countdown appears at the top of the screen when there is less than a minute left, and if time expires, Jazz loses a life. If Jazz reaches and shoots the finish sign before time runs out, the player is then provided with additional score points awarded for the remaining time and a perfect score if he picks up all items and/or deals with all enemies. If Jazz finishes the area with a big red diamond, he gets to enter the bonus stage. In these stages, animation switches to a pseudo-3D (third-person shooter) of Jazz as he runs on a speedway with the purpose of gathering as many blue diamonds as requested before time runs out, while obstacles try to stop him or slow him down. If the task is accomplished successfully, the player is provided with an extra life. Jazz in his lizard form Aside from bonuses, Jazz also features secret levels that can be accessed in specific areas of other levels once in every episode. Secret level signs feature the question mark instead of Devan's head portrait that must be shot. The current level is then considered completed and the secret level embarks. Levels themselves consist of an enormous \\"grant\\" area with numerous weapons and items to pick up. One level, however, features a mini-boss, while the player assumes control of Jazz in his sidekick bird form. Secret levels also feature a count-up upon completion that provides the player with extra score points. ==Development== Jazz Jackrabbit was coded by Arjan Brussee and designed by Cliff Bleszinski for Epic MegaGames. It was greatly inspired by the Amiga game Zool and the ongoing success of video game classics (such as Sonic the Hedgehog and Mega Man) defining the platform game genre in the 1990s market, and was initially considered to be a pastiche of Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog in the computer world. The game did not manage to reach the popularity of Sonic, but did acquire a sizable audience due to its fast-paced gameplay and advanced graphics. The game's audio was implemented using an interactive music system called \\"Cybersound Music System\\". On November 28, 1994, a CD-ROM version was released under the title \\"Jazz Jackrabbit CD\\", containing all six original episodes, as well as 3 additional ones known as \\"The Lost Episodes\\" listed as episodes A, B, and C. In episode C, there is a secret level with Jazz in the form of a lizard. A shareware Christmas edition was released on December 15, 1994, with a special 3-level holiday-themed episode, titled \\"Holiday Hare\\". Subsequent pressings of the CD-ROM edition added Holiday Hare as episode X, bringing the total episode count to 10. Furthermore, on November 17, 1995, another shareware Christmas edition was released with a different holiday episode, titled \\"Holiday Hare '95\\", with 2 new holiday-themed worlds. ==Legacy== A sequel named Jazz Jackrabbit 2 was released in 1998, as well as a reboot on Game Boy Advance in 2002. The commercial success of the game kickstarted the career of its co-creator, Cliff Bleszinski, who would later be a key force behind Epic Games' Unreal and Gears of War. The engine of the pseudo-3D stages was reused for the racing game 2 Fast 4 You, an advertorial game for BiFi that was released in 1996 for DOS. ==ReferencesCategory:1994 video games Category:Epic Games games Category:DOS games Category:Jazz Jackrabbit Category:Run and gun games Category:Video games developed in the Netherlands Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Single-player video games Category:Side-scrolling platform games Category:Christmas video games ","title":"Jazz Jackrabbit (1994 video game)"},{"id":"2232700","text":"Elizabeth Billington (1765 or 1768, in London25 August 1818, in Venice) was a British opera singer. ==Life== Frederika Weichsell, mother of Mrs. Elizabeth Billington She was probably born about 1768 in Litchfield Street, Soho, London. She was the daughter of Carl Weichsel, a native of Freiberg, in Saxony, principal oboist at the King's Theatre. Her mother, Frederika, n√©e Weirman,Grove an English vocalist of some distinction, was a pupil of Johann Christian Bach, and sang at Vauxhall with success between 1765 and 1775. Elizabeth Weichsel received her earliest musical instruction, in company with her brother Charles (who afterwards was known as a violinist) from her father, under whom she studied the pianoforte with such assiduity that on 10 March 1774 she played at a concert at the Haymarket for her mother's benefit. In addition to her father's instruction she studied under Johann Samuel Schroeter, and before she was twelve years old published two sets of pianoforte sonatas. She now began to turn her attention to the cultivation of her voice, and at the early age of fourteen appeared at a public concert in Oxford. On 13 October 1783 she was married under her mother's maiden name, Wierman, at Lambeth Church to James Billington, a double-bass player in the Drury Lane orchestra, from whom she had had lessons in singing. Immediately after their marriage the Billingtons went to Dublin, where she made her first appearance on the stage in the part of Eurydice. After singing at Waterford and other towns in Ireland she returned to London in 1786, and was offered an engagement at Covent Garden for three nights only, but she insisted on being engaged for twelve nights, at a salary of ¬£12 a week. On these terms she was announced to appear on 14 Feb. 1786, but the renown she had already won in Dublin had preceded her, and 'by command of their majesties' she appeared on the 13th as Rosetta in Thomas Arne's Love in a Village. At the end of the twelve nights she was engaged for the rest of the season at a salary of ¬£1,000. A contemporary account of her at this period says that her voice was of great sweetness, compass, and power, and that she possessed 'a great deal of genuine beauty and very unaffected and charming manners;' but the secret of her great success was the unremitting zeal with which she studied her art. Her brother-in-law, Thomas Billington, says that she had originally 'a very indifferent voice and manner,' which she completely changed by the industry with which, throughout her public career, she pursued her studies. At the end of her first season she went to Paris, and had lessons from the Antonio Sacchini, whose last pupil she was, and at different periods of her career she also studied with Morelli, Ferdinando Paer, and Friedrich Heinrich Himmel. She returned to London for the season of 1786‚Äì7, and continued to sing there, at Covent Garden, the Concerts of Ancient Music, the so-called Oratorios, and the Handel Commemorations, until the end of 1793. William Shield wrote his operas of 'Marian' and 'The Prophet' for her, and in 1789 she appeared as Yarico in Dr. Arnold's long-popular compilation, 'Inkle and Yarico.' Others of her favourite parts were Mandane (in 'Artaxerxes'), and the heroines in 'Polly,' the 'Duenna,' the 'Castle of Andalusia,' 'Corali,' 'Clara,' the 'Flitch of Bacon'. Mrs. Billington was not happy in her marriage, and even before she had appeared on the London stage rumour had been busy with her fair fame. In 1792 there appeared an anonymous publication, which professed to contain her private correspondence with her mother. This work was of so disgraceful and scurrilous a description that Mrs. Billington was forced to take legal proceedings against the publishers. An answer to the 'Memoirs' appeared in due course ; but it seems probable that the scandal induced Mrs. Billington to abandon her profession and retire to the Continent. Accompanied by her brother and her husband, she left England early in 1794, and travelled by way of Germany to Italy. At Naples she was induced by Sir William Hamilton, the English ambassador, to sing in private before the royal family. This led to her singing at the San Carlo, where she appeared in a new opera, 'Inez di Castro,' written expressly for her by Francesco Bianchi, on 30 May 1794. Her singing created an extraordinary impression, but her triumph was cut short by the sudden death of her husband, which took place the day after her first appearance, as he was preparing to accompany his wife to the theatre, after dining with the Bishop of Winchester. She stayed at Naples sixteen months, and then sang at Florence, Leghorn, Milan, Venice, and Trieste. In 1797, when singing at Venice, she was prostrated with a severe illness for six weeks. On her recovery the opera house was illuminated for three nights. James Hopwood At Milan she was received with much favour by the Jos√©phine de Beauharnais, and here she met a young Frenchman, M. Felissent, to whom she was married in 1799. After her second marriage she went to live at St. Artien, an estate she had bought between Venice and Treviso; but her life was rendered so insupportable by the ill-treatment she received from her husband that in 1801 she left him and returned to England. Felissent, who, it was said, had been publicly flogged as an impostor at Milan, followed her to London, but he was arrested and expelled the country as an alien. Mrs. Billington's return to London caused a great stir in the musical world, and the managers both of Covent Garden (Harris) and Drury Lane (Richard Brinsley Sheridan) were eager to secure her services. After some negotiation it was arranged that she should appear alternately at both houses, the terms she was to receive being 3,000 guineas for the season, together with a benefit guaranteed to amount to ¬£500, and ¬£500 to her brother for leading the orchestra on the nights she appeared. Her reappearance took place at Covent Garden on 3 Oct. 1801, in Thomas Arne's Artaxerxes, in which she sang the part of Mandane, Incledon singing that of Arbaces. During 1801 she made from ¬£10,000 to ¬£15,000, and at one time her fortune is said to have amounted to ¬£65,000. In 1802 Mrs. Billington appeared in Italian opera at the King's Theatre, on the occasion of the farewell of Banti, when both these great artists sang in Sebastiano Nasolini's 'Merope.' A similar performance took place on 3 June of the same year, when she was induced to sing a duet with Mara, at the farewell concert of her great rival. From this time until her retirement in 1811 she continued to sing in Italian opera. Winter wrote his 'Calypso' (1803) expressly for her, and in 1806 she distinguished herself by producing, for her benefit, La Clemenza di Tito, the first opera by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart performed in this country. During 1809-10 she suffered much from ill-health, and at length she retired from the profession, her last appearance being announced at her brother's benefit concert on 3 May 1811. She appeared, however, once more at Whitehall Chapel in 1814, at a concert in aid of the sufferers by the German war. After her retirement she lived in princely style at a villa at Fulham. In 1817 she was reconciled to her husband, and went with him to live near Venice, where she died on 25 August 1818. Her child by her first husband had died in infancy ; but it was believed that an adopted child, whom she had placed in a convent at Brussels, was her own daughter. ==Critical reception== Elizabeth Billington, after Sir Joshua Reynolds Contemporary opinions as to the merits of Mrs. Billington as a singer differ to a singular degree. It was always her misfortune to be forced into a position of rivalry with some other great artist, and thus partisanship often guided the judgments of her critics. As to the perfect finish of her singing all are agreed. The Earl of Mount Edgcombe says that her voice was sweet and flexible, her execution neat and precise, her embellishments in good taste and judicious, but that she lacked feeling, and was no actress. Miss Seward writes of her : 'She has too much sense to gambol like Mara in the sacred songs;' but George III, who was no mean judge‚Äîby suggesting in a written memorandum, that Lord Carmarthen 'if he can get her to sing pathetick songs, and not to over-grace them, will be doing an essential service to the court'‚Äîseems to imply that she had the great fault of the singers of that day, viz. the excessive and indiscriminate use of vocal embellishments. She was all through her life a finished pianist. Salomon used to say that 'she sang with her fingers,' and quite late in life she played a duet in public with J. B. Cramer. In person Mrs. Billington was very handsome, though inclined to stoutness. Her portrait was painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds as Saint Cecilia, and has been engraved by James Ward, Pastorini, and Cardon. The exhibition of old masters at Burlington House in 1885 contained a small portrait by Reynolds, said to be of Mrs. Billington in her youth, a statement which is probably inaccurate. Two miniatures of her were painted, one by Daniel, and there are engravings of her by T. Burke after De Koster, as Mandane by Heath after Stothard, by Bartolozzi after Cosway, by Dunkarton after Downman, and by Assen. A portrait of Clara in the 'Duenna,' painted and engraved by J. R. Smith in 1797, probably represents Mrs. Billington. Haydn said of her, that Sir Joshua Reynolds should rather have painted the angels listening to Mrs Billington singing, than have depicted, as he did, Mrs Billington listening to the angels. ==References== Attribution: * * Endnotes: **Gent, Mag. lxiv. 671, lxxxviii. 69 ; **Georgian Era (1832), iv. 291 ; **Egerton MSS. 2169, ff. 57, 66; **Earl of Mount Edgcumbe's Musical Reminiscences (2nd ed. 1827), ¬ß vi. ; **Busby's Concert Room Anecdotes, i. 151, 212, 217, ii. 4; **Eaton's Musical Criticism (1872), 172 ; **Seward's Letters (1811), i. 153 ; **Harmonicon for 1830, 93 ; **Public Characters (1802-3), 394 ; **H.

The incident happened at about 6.50 am. The eight other injured workers who were working on top of the structure, were sent to the nearby Raffles Hospital before rescuers arrived. Seven of the injured were from Bangladesh while the eighth was from China. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) ordered all construction work to stop, while the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) revoked the construction permit for the site while investigations were underway. MOM said that based on preliminary information gathered, workers were pouring concrete, also known as the casting process, into the formwork when the structure supporting the formwork collapsed. The formwork, located between the new and old sections of the station, was part of the structure being built to form the underground linkway, which is about three to four metres deep. The area affected is localised, measuring about five metres by 10 metres and the entire station is about 7,500 square metres.

An alternative system is the dry sump, whereby oil is pumped from a shallow sump into an external reservoir.Wet sump and dry sump compared - https://www.knowyourparts.com/technical-resources/engine/oil-system- differences/#:~:text=Dry%20Oil%20Systems%20Wet%20sump%20systems%20store%20the,is%20used%20to%20pump%20oil%20from%20the%20motor. Piston engines are lubricated by oil which is pumped into various bearings, and thereafter allowed to drain to the base of the engine under gravity. In most production cars and motorcycles, which use a wet sump system, the oil is collected in a 3 to 10 l volume pan at the base of the engine, known as the sump or oil pan, where it is pumped back up to the bearings by the oil pump, internal to the engine. A wet sump offers the advantage of a simple design, using a single pump and no external reservoir. Since the sump is internal, there is no need for hoses or tubes connecting the engine to an external sump which may leak. An internal oil pump is generally more difficult to replace, but that is dependent on the engine design. A wet sump design can be problematic in a racing car, as the large g-force pulled by drivers going around corners causes the oil in the pan to slosh, gravitating away from the oil pick-up, briefly starving the system of oil and damaging the engine. However, on a motorcycle this difficulty does not arise, as a bike leans into corners and the oil is not displaced sideways. Nevertheless, racing motorcycles usually benefit from dry sump lubrication, as the shallow sump allows the engine to be mounted lower in the frame; and a remote oil tank can enables improved lubricant cooling. On some dry sump motorcycles, such as the Yamaha TRX850 and the Yamaha TDM, the oil tank is integral to the engine, sitting atop the gearbox. Early stationary engines employed a small scoop on the extremity of the crankshaft or connecting rod to assist with the lubrication of the cylinder walls by means of a splashing action. == Two- stroke and four-stroke engines == Small two-stroke engines, such as in motorcycles and lawnmowers, have total loss lubrication. Such engines use crankcase compression to feed the fuel/air mixture through the crankcase. This precludes the use of both wet sump and dry sump systems, as excess oil here would contaminate the mixture, leading to excess oil being burned in the engine and so excessive hydrocarbon emissions. These engines consume a fuel/air/oil mixe, the oil contained in a pre-mixed petroil fuel, or separately injected by a pump into the engine cylinders and bearings. Four- stroke engines large (non-petrol) two-stroke engines used in locomotives and ships may have either wet or dry sumps. Large two-stroke engines do not use crankcase compression; instead they use a separate blower or supercharger, either a mechanical blower such as a Roots supercharger or a turbocharger. ==Types of Wet Sump== * The Splash System * The Splash and Pressure System * The full Pressure Feed System ==References== Category:Engine lubrication systems ","title":"Wet sump"},{"id":"2232733","text":"James Shane Byrne (born 18 July 1971) is a former Irish rugby union hooker.

It is rectangular in form (approximately 6 meters by 10), with six niches. Today, it lies approximately 12 meters beneath the Stephansplatz. ==History== The history of the chapel is not entirely clear. The architecture can be dated to the early 13th century. At this time, Frederick the Warlike (1230-1246), the last Duke of the House of Babenberg, was the ruler of Vienna. It has been hypothesized that the Duke, who would have liked to have established Vienna as an episcopal see, had the crypt built for St. Coloman of Stockerau, who was to be the patron of the new diocese. However, the chronicles do not mention the chapel, which has given rise to the speculation that it is the remnant of a failed project. In the year 1307, a burial chapel of the Viennese family Chrannest is mentioned. The chapel was said to have multiple altars, one of which was dedicated to St. Vergilius of Salzburg. In the Middle Ages, the Stephansdom was encircled by a large cemetery. A single small chapel, dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene (the Magdalenskapelle or Magdalene Chapel), existed for consecrations and requiem masses. The Virgilius Chapel lay directly underneath this chapel, and a vertical shaft connected the two buildings. In 1782, the cemetery around the Stephansdom was closed. The Magdalene Chapel was destroyed by fire in 1781 and was not rebuilt (presumably as, without a cemetery, there was no need for a funeral chapel). The Virgilius Chapel was filled with rubble and faded into obscurity. In 1973 the chapel was rediscovered during construction of the Vienna U-Bahn. Today there is a mosaic on the Stephansplatz showing the outlines of the Virgilius Chapel. The chapel itself has survived with hardly any damage and provides the visitor with an excellent glance into the world of the Middle Ages. ==Location== The Virgilius Chapel may be entered directly from the Stephansplatz U-Bahn Station. It is possible to look into the chapel from above. A collection of historical ceramics has been installed at the entrance to the chapel itself. == External links == * The Virgilkapelle at the spiritual travel guide, \\"Stationen\\" (in German).

The school was founded in 1968 by professors and assistant-professors from the Catholic University of Leuven. These professors and assistant-professors wanted to use innovative teaching practices that were not commonly used at the time. These practices included using case studies and management games. At that time many professors at top universities lectured without a profound business experience. Since the implementation of the Bachelor and Master classification of academic titles in Europe, the small business school had to associate with a traditional university. In 2007 VLEKHO merged with other Brussels-based Higher Education Institutions to become Hogeschool-Universiteit Brussel, the only other university in the KU Leuven Association. ==History of VlekhoThe Department of Business Economics=== The Department of Business Economics dates from 1968, when the Flemish School of Higher Education in Economics (Vlekho) was founded in a combined effort on the part of academics, politicians and businessmen to establish a high-quality training programme in business economics in the heart of Brussels. Vlekho's principal objective was clear from the very outset: it wanted to provide business economists with a solid academic formation and a training that would enable them to successfully hold positions of responsibility in business, government service and the social-profit sector. Upon graduation students are granted the diploma of 'Licentiate in Business Economics' (Post-Bologna process, Master in Business Economics), a degree equivalent to the traditional four-year university degree in economics. Vlekho's study programme in business economics differs from the traditional university programme, however, by its outspoken business-oriented character and its hands-on approach to education, which besides the communication of knowledge strongly emphasizes the development of business attitudes. Each year some seven hundred students are enrolled in the programme. Internationally, the Department of Business Economics is an active participant in the European Commission's Socrates Programme. To visiting students it offers a programme in International Business in English, a combination of courses and a three-months' internship in an international company in Brussels. In addition, bilateral co-operation agreements have been made with various universities outside the EU. ===The Department of Applied Linguistics=== In 1983 the Dutch-language section of the Department of Translation and Interpreting of the Institut libre Marie Haps, the oldest and most prestigious school of translation and interpreting in Belgium, was transferred to Vlekho where it became the Department of Applied Linguistics. Each year some seven hundred students are enrolled in this programme. The foreign language courses in the Department are taught in the foreign language, the other degree courses are conducted in Dutch. Here, too, students can participate in a large variety of exchange programmes. ===The Centre for Graduate Studies=== Soon after Vlekho was founded, the need was felt to offer further studies in addition to the four-year degree of 'Licentiate'. The Centre for Graduate Studies offers a programme in basic business economics for young graduates without a formal training in economics. Experienced business people, in turn, are offered an opportunity to deepen their knowledge of company management in advanced courses (Dutch and English). Each year more than six hundred students are enrolled in the courses organized by the Centre. ==External links== * Vlekho website Category:Colleges in Belgium Category:Universities and colleges in Brussels Category:Educational institutions established in 1968 Category:Universities and colleges formed by merger in Belgium ","title":"Vlekho"},{"id":"2232753","text":"Parading on donkey Parading on a donkey is a traditional psychological punishment, consisting in a public humiliation. ==Scope== * In rural areas of India, it is intended to humiliate those guilty of minor crimes, and usually meted out by village elders or the local panchayat system of justice.

It was the band's last for Casablanca Records, the only label for which Kiss had recorded up to that point. The album was dedicated to the memory of Casablanca founder and early Kiss supporter Neil Bogart,Kiss ‚Äì Creatures of the Night back album cover. Casablanca Records. Retrieved April 8, 2012. who had died of cancer during the recording sessions. It is also the band's last album recorded with Ace Frehley credited as an official member and their first album with Vinnie Vincent as the initially-uncredited lead guitarist (Vincent would later be credited but not featured on the cover of the 1985 reissue of the album). It was also Kiss' last album to feature the band with their trademark makeup until the 1998 release, Psycho Circus. ==Background== The album represented a conscious effort by Kiss to return to the hard rock style that had helped them achieve commercial success with Destroyer and Love Gun. Their pop-oriented albums Dynasty and Unmasked had started a decline in popularity that reached rock bottom with 1981's Music from \\"The Elder\\". By 1982, Kiss knew it needed to deliver on their earlier 1980‚Äì81 promise of a heavy record. The first key ingredient was songwriter/guitarist Vinnie Vincent, who was soon to replace Ace Frehley as the band's new lead guitarist after being introduced to the band by album co- writer Adam Mitchell. Though Frehley did not play on the album, his face was still featured on the album cover for contractual and commercial reasons. Frehley had been pushing the band to do a heavy rock record since Dynasty, and by the time of Creatures of the Night he was fully disillusioned with the band, and that combined with alcoholism and a prescription medicine dependency (begun after a car wreck) led to his leaving the band during the recording sessions. On the tour, Vincent was introduced with his Egyptian Ankh make-up, designed in a hurry by Paul Stanley. In 1985, Kiss re-released the album in their non-make-up state with a cover featuring Gene Simmons, Stanley, Eric Carr and then-current guitarist Bruce Kulick (even though Kulick did not play on the album). Vinnie Vincent had long since departed the band (being twice fired) by 1985. By 1982, Kiss's popularity in the US had plummeted due to changing music tastes and their near abandonment of hard rock. 1979's Dynasty, while commercially successful, alienated many fans with the disco-flavored track \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\". 1980's Unmasked fell further into pop music‚Äîand was Kiss's first album not to achieve platinum status since 1975's Dressed to Kill. The band did not even tour the US for Unmasked, and it was also soon faced with its first lineup change: founding member Peter Criss, who had not participated in any of the Unmasked recording sessions, officially left Kiss in 1980. He was replaced by Eric Carr. Fan hopes were raised in late 1980 when Kiss announced that they were going to record their heaviest record yet. Instead, the band released Music from \\"The Elder\\" in late 1981, a concept album originally intended to complement a film called The Elder that was ultimately never filmed. The album was storyline-based and had ballads, a short orchestral piece, and different lyrical themes. The album failed to achieve gold status, and having cancelled their US Unmasked Tour just a short time before, the band then called off the planned tour for Music from \\"The Elder\\". Frehley soon left the band. Kiss's label situation had changed as well. Casablanca Records founder Neil Bogart had sold the label to its distributor PolyGram, and went on to briefly form The Boardwalk Recording Company before being diagnosed with and later succumbing to cancer. Using a clause in their Casablanca contract that gave the band an option to leave the label if Bogart did, Kiss became free agents and signed a multimillion-dollar deal with Mercury Records. Mercury, a label also owned by PolyGram, reverted the band to their \\"old\\" label, though in name only. ==Recording== When recording sessions for Creatures of the Night began in July 1982, Kiss was essentially a trio. Frehley still made appearances with the band but had nearly ended his musical involvement with Kiss. Frehley looked completely out of sorts in promotional appearances for the album; in cases where the band was lip syncing to recorded tracks, he did not know the material. It was only after the album was released and a short promotional tour of Europe was completed that Frehley officially left Kiss. The lead guitar replacement for Frehley for the Creatures of the Night Tour/10th Anniversary Tour in the US was Vinnie Vincent, who adopted the Ankh make-up. Musically, the progressive rock of Music From \\"The Elder\\" and the pop of Dynasty and Unmasked were completely absent from Creatures of the Night, making it the heaviest album the group had made at that point.MusicMight Kiss biography . Retrieved April 8, 2012. \\"I Still Love You\\", the only ballad on Creatures of the Night, was still heavier and darker than any ballad Kiss had released in earlier years. Also contributing to the heavy sound was Carr's drumming style, which was more similar to John Bonham's drumming than to Criss' jazz-influenced style.Rubin, Jon KISS Rocks' Exclusive 1989 Interview with Eric Carr. kissrocks.com. Retrieved April 8, 2012. Some of the earliest pressings of the album mistakenly contained one full side of John Cougar's American Fool. Both Kiss and Cougar were under the umbrella of Mercury Records at the time. Creatures of the Night is the first Kiss album to have all lead vocal duties handled by either Simmons or Stanley exclusively. All previous studio releases by the group contained at least one song with lead vocals by another band member. The band released a video for \\"I Love It Loud\\", which received moderate airplay on MTV. In it was a stage setup that featured Carr's drum kit as a giant metallic tank with an exploding turret. Flames and explosions were also in abundance, as Kiss attempted to produce a video that reflected the music on Creatures of the Night. Frehley did appear in the video as the rhythm guitarist, with Stanley shown playing the seven-note solo. Though Kiss had used \\"ghost players\\" on previous albums, most notably Bob Kulick (Alive II and Killers) and Dick Wagner (Destroyer), Vinnie Vincent handled most of the lead guitar as a session player and co-writer before being added as the full-time replacement for Frehley, though as an employee and not a full member (like Carr). Blues guitarist Robben Ford, a friend of the album's producer Michael James Jackson, contributed two solos in what he described as one of his weirdest gigs. Mr. Mister guitarist Steve Farris (who was considered as a replacement for Frehley but was thought to not have \\"the right look\\") provided the solo and lead fills to the title track. Co-writer Adam Mitchell also contributed guitar work to the title track. Though often given credit for playing the solos on \\"Keep Me Comin\\" and \\"Danger\\", Bob Kulick admitted in a 2011 interview that none of the studio work he did on Creatures of the Night made it to the album,; this confirmed the same from an earlier Mitchell interview. Jimmy Haslip (former member of Blackjack) declared in 2008 that he was invited by James Jackson to record 5 songs (Simmons allegedly refused to play his bass parts due to the end of his relationship with Diana Ross), but Haslip only confirmed that he recorded \\"Danger\\". Ace Frehley's Origins, Vol. 1 album (2016) included a cover of ‚ÄúRock and Roll Hell‚Äù. ==Cover== Three official variations on the album artwork exist: the 1982 original issue, the 1985 reissue (featuring Bruce Kulick, who was not a member of the band for Creatures of the Night, and the rest of the band without make-up), and the 1997 remastered version (same photo as the original, but with minor variations in the logo and lettering). On the 1985 non-make-up release, the song \\"Creatures of the Night\\" is remixed, and \\"Saint and Sinner\\" and \\"Killer\\" are interchanged from side to side with each other. The bootlegged Vinnie Vincent cover has not been released on CD, but an extra rare Vincent cover has been called \\"Hiding from Tomorrow\\". There is also a bootlegged LP which shows up on eBay from time to time and claims to be a Brazilian promo version with Vincent in make-up airbrushed over Frehley. ==Reception== Despite positive reviews, the album did not return the band to the commercial success they had held five years previous, and despite charting higher than The Elder (#45 compared to The Elder's #75), Creatures of the Night would not attain gold status until 1994. The album would receive critical recognition with both Kerrang! and Guitar World magazines placing the album at #5 on their lists of best hard rock albums in 1982.Guitar World Readers Poll of the Top 10 Guitar Albums of 1983.

Simmons and Stanley, who have generally been dismissive of the band's post-1977 albums, considered Creatures to be one of their stronger efforts. Creatures of the Night was certified gold by the RIAA on May 9, 1994. It was certified gold in Brazil in 1983 for sales of 100,000 copies. ==Live performances== The supporting album tour began shortly after Christmas and spanned the first five months of 1983, with the band's itinerary focused almost entirely on North America, with three concerts being played in Brazil, in an attempt to rebuild their diminished US fanbase. However, the Creatures Tour proved to be a bigger failure than the last North American tour in 1979. Kiss played to numerous half-empty arenas on the tour, including venues that the band had sold out or at least played to near-full capacity four years earlier on the Dynasty Tour and shows canceled due to insufficient ticket sales. Despite this, the favourable fan perception of the album has ensured that \\"War Machine\\", \\"I Love It Loud\\", and \\"Creatures of the Night\\" remain Kiss concert staples to this day.

The German word Aue (variant Au) means \\"river island, wetland, floodplain, riparian woodland\\", i.e. a cultivated landscape in a riparian zone. The words Aue and Au occur in a large number of German place names‚Äîincluding Donau, the German word for the Danube River‚Äîand refer to forests, meadows, and wetlands in river and stream lowlands and floodplains. The Danube-Auen National Park protects a large area of lowland forests, meadows, wetlands, and other riparian habitat along the Danube just downstream of Vienna. The Park was designated an IUCN category II national park and spans the areas of Vienna (Lobau), Gro√ü-Enzersdorf, Orth an der Donau, Eckartsau, Engelhartstetten, Hainburg, Bad Deutsch-Altenburg, Petronell-Carnuntum, Regelsbrunn, Haslau-Maria Ellend, Fischamend and Schwechat. The Park near Lobau and Gro√ü-Enzersdorf, with Vienna International Airport on the left ==Creation of the National Park== Until the 19th century the Danube was an untamed river. In the 19th century, extensive engineering began to alter the natural balance of the river landscape dramatically. Many side-channels were dammed so that they now carry water from the Danube only at flood stages. Ever more intrusive engineering interventions were accompanied by decades of heavy forestry use in many parts of lowland forests. In the 1950s, development began of a nearly unbroken chain of hydroelectric power plants and associated dams on the Austrian section of the Danube River. In 1984, the planned construction of the Hainburg hydroelectric power plant, just downstream from Vienna, threatened the destruction one of two remaining free-flowing sections of the Danube in Austria and its riparian forests (the other remaining free-flowing section in Austria is upstream, near Wachau). An outcry by environmental and nature protection groups caused nationwide protests against the project. The operator of the power plant project disregarded the protests and began work to clear the area. Protests stepped up, eventually leading to the occupation of the Hainburg wetlands by thousands of people from all ages and professions (the so-called \\"Hainburg Movement\\"). After police tried several times to clear protestors from the area, in December 1984 the Federal Government declared a pause for reflection. In January 1985 the Austrian Supreme Court forbad further deforestation. In March 1985, the so-called Konrad Lorenz- Volksbegehren (petition), signed by 353,906 people, demanded the prohibition of large power plants such as Hainburg and the establishment of a national park in the area of Hainburg. On 1 July 1986, the Administrative Court released a decision cancelling the water rights of the planned power plant. Extensive scientific studies were then made of the area, with surprising discoveries. More species of fish were observed than was known at the time the planning of the power plant. The most important result of these studies was that the Danube lowlands area (Donau-Auen) in and east of Vienna was determined to be worthy of becoming a national park. It was also determined that creating a power plant in the area would not be compatible with national park status for the region. On October 27, 1996, a State Treaty between the Republic of Austria and the federal states of Vienna and Lower Austria was signed. With that treaty, Donau-Auen National Park was officially opened. ==Flora and fauna== In the National Park area there are more than 700 species of higher plants, more than 30 mammals, 100 species of breeding birds, 8 reptiles, 13 amphibian species, and around 50 species of fish. Among the most characteristic inhabitants of the wetlands of the National Park are the Danube crested newt, European pond turtle, European mudminnow, white-tailed eagle, Eurasian kingfisher, and Eurasian beaver. With the variety of insects living on both land and water, and other invertebrates, the total number of species in Donau-Auen National Park is estimated to be at least 5,000. == The River == Monument with high water marks near Stopfenreuth ‚Äì highest: August 15th, 2002 The main channel of the Danube was separated from its side channels by the flood control measures that were constructed around the year 1900. The outcome was a higher current velocity in the main channel, with a resulting deepening of the river bed, while in the side channels--which no longer had current flowing through them--sand and loam deposits were no longer removed by the current. In a natural riparian ecosystem woody plants and deadwood have a strong impact on the natural flow dynamics, by stabilizing riverbanks, by reducing erosion, and by creating areas of reducing or increased flow rates, and thus affecting in which areas sediments are deposited or removed. Large tree trunks and accumulations of smaller flotsam cause the water to stagnate and the speed of the current to drop, leading to increased sedimentation. To counteract the effects of the flood control measures, beginning in 2002 individual side channels were tied in with the main channel again--at least at high water times--via Gew√§sservernetzungen (\\"water crossings\\"), which lower or remove the levees protecting those channels. In a 2006 pilot project created with the support of the LIFE+ Program of the European Union and the Austrian riverways agency via donau, about three kilometers of the complete flood works were removed across the river from Hainburg, so that the river once again could spread into the floodplain areas. In a similar project near Witzelsdorf, about one kilometer of the levees were removed. After the completion of the pilot projects in Hainburg and Witzelsdorf, future plans for this river engineering project are for removal of 50% of the levees and flood control works between Vienna and the eastern border of Austria. Aside from a revitalization of the Au (riparian zone), the project promises to mediate the effects of floods on the river and to stabilize the riverbed to the benefit of both river ecology and navigation.Andrea Katschthaler: (Titel), Der Standard, Print, 28.

The original French language song was \\"La goualante du pauvre Jean\\" (\\"The Ballad of Poor John\\"), with music by Marguerite Monnot and words by Ren√© Rouzaud. Edith Piaf had one of her biggest hits with the original French version. The song was adapted by American songwriter Jack Lawrence in 1954, and he wrote English lyrics, which are considerably different from the French. The English-language title arises in part from a misinterpretation of the French title, as \\"pauvre Jean\\" was taken for the same-sounding \\"pauvres gens,\\" which translates as \\"poor people.\\" Lawrence's lyrics, which pronounce Paris in the French style, as \\"PaREE,\\" are seldom heard. Most of the popular recordings of the song in the English-speaking world have been instrumentals. ==Les Baxter version== A recording of the tune by Les Baxter's orchestra (Capitol Records catalog number 3336, with the flip side \\"Theme from 'Helen of Troy'\\") was a number-one hit on the Billboard chart in the US in 1956: for four weeks on the Best Sellers in Stores chart, for six weeks on the Most Played by Jockeys and Hot 100 charts, and for three weeks on the Most Played on Jukeboxes chart. This recording was also released in Australia by Capitol under catalog number CP-1044. This version of the song was also the last song to reach number one before Elvis Presley's \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" topped the chart. Baxter's version featured strings, brass, a wordless chorus, tinkling percussion, finger snapping, and a group of whistlers. ==Winifred Atwell version== In the same year, the piano version by Winifred Atwell (Decca Records catalog number F10681) was number one in the UK Singles Chart for three weeks. In Australia, it was released as Decca Catalogue number Y 6783. ==Other versions== *Cover versions by Lawrence Welk, Russ Morgan (Decca Records catalog number 29835, with the flip side \\"Annabelle\\") and Chet Atkins appeared in the US Top 100. *Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney recorded a version containing the seldom-heard Lawrence lyrics for their 1965 album That Travelin' Two-Beat. *Dean Martin recorded the song with the Lawrence lyrics for his 1962 album French Style. *Billy May also recorded a Latin-styled version that appears in the Ultra-Lounge CD Volume 10: A Bachelor in Paris, that was edited together with Les Baxter's version. *In 1991, Episode 6 of Series 2 of Vic Reeves Big Night Out featured a version of the song with completely new lyrics detailing The Man With The Stick's holiday. *A 1955 version of Eddie Cochran was released in 1997 on the album Rockin' It Country Style. *Reginald Dixon released a version of the song as part of a medley with the songs \\"Willie Can\\" and \\"The Happy Whistler\\" on his 2009 compilation album Reginald Dixon at the Organ. * Lenny Dee recorded an instrumental version in his 1965 album \\"The Lenny Dee Tour\\" (Decca DL 74654). ==References== Category:Number-one singles in the United States Category:Billboard Top 100 number-one singles Category:Number-one singles in Australia Category:1954 songs Category:1956 singles Category:√âdith Piaf songs Category:Songs with lyrics by Jack Lawrence Category:Songs about Paris Category:Eddie Cochran songs Category:Capitol Records singles ","title":"The Poor People of Paris"},{"id":"2232801","text":"Hunter Bradley may refer to: *Hunter Bradley (American football) (born 1994), American football player *Hunter Bradley (Power Rangers Ninja Storm), a fictional character on American television series Power Rangers Ninja Storm ","title":"Hunter Bradley"},{"id":"2232804","text":"Wang Tiantian (; born February 14, 1986 in Tianjin, China) Wang's first major competition was at the 2003 Asian Championship. She won the vault finals as well a silver medal on floor exercise. Her success at Asian Championship gave her the chance to compete at the 2003 World Championships where she placed 4th with her team. In 2004 Wang became China's National All Around Champion and Triple Silver Medalist during Event Finals (vault, uneven bars and floor). She competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics and the 2004 World Cup Final. In the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens she qualified for the Vault finals and the Individual All-Around. She had a weak showing in these Olympics. In the team final she fell on floor exercise (underrotating her triple twist in her final pass and putting her hands down) and scored an 8.637. She fell on her beam dismount in the Individual AA competition and scored an 8.725 (she ended up 13th that night). She then fell on her first Vault in the event finals and averaged a 9.081 (ranking 7th). She did not win any medals in either the Olympics or the World Cup. Before the World Cup Finals, Wang had some success at the 2004 Trophee Massilia Cup, where she won five medals (2 gold, 1 silver, 2 bronze). In 2005, she won bronze medals on vault at the 2005 National Championships and at the 2005 Cottbus Cup. In October, 2005, Wang Tiantian competed at the National Games, but a nagging foot injury hampered her performance. The injury kept her out of the East Asia Games several weeks later and eventually required surgery at the end of 2005. As of January 2006, she was still recovering from the injury but had rejoined the National Team in Beijing. ==External links== * Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:Chinese female artistic gymnasts Category:Gymnasts at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Gymnasts from Tianjin Category:Universiade medalists in gymnastics Category:Universiade gold medalists for China Category:Olympic gymnasts of China ","title":"Wang Tiantian"},{"id":"2232808","text":"Brighter Death Now is the artist name under which Roger Karmanik (b. 1965 as Roger Karlsson), the founder of the Swedish record label Cold Meat Industry, releases death industrial, power electronics and dark ambient music. Whereas early Brighter Death Now recordings tended to be largely instrumental and atmospherically oriented, present-day releases often feature screamed vocals, distorted beyond comprehension. Throughout its history, Karmanik has kept his music's thematic elements focused on such topics as child molestation, sadism, and psychosis. The Great Death trilogy and May All Be Dead have become rare collectors items, and are sought after by many Brighter Death Now fans. Roger Karmanik has been active under other names such as Lille Roger (Swedish for Little Roger) and Bomb The Daynursery. In 2009, Karmanik remixed the short films of Jason LaRay Keener as projection for live shows. watch Karmanik closed down Cold Meat Industries around the beginning of 2014 as he expressed that he was suffering mentally and physically from the stress of running the label. By the end of 2014, Karmanik had fully immersed himself within the shroud of Brighter Death Now and announced the creation of his new label Familjegraven whose sole purpose is to release his own projects, including rarities, reissues, and new recordings. ==DiscographyAs Brighter Death Now=== {  !Year !Title !Format !Notes - 1989 Temp Tations Cassette release, limited to 50 copies.  - 1989 Pain in Progress 1989 (Unclean Production/Cold Meat Industry) URD 08 90 12 33-01/CMI-03 LP.

Dmitry was the second son of Alexander Nevsky. When his elder brother Vasily died young, Dmitry remained the chief heir to his illustrious father. As early as 1259, he was left by Alexander in charge of Novgorod. Upon Alexander's death in 1264, however, the Novgorodians expelled Dmitry to his native Pereslavl-Zalessky, citing his youth as a pretext. Four years later, when Dmitry had turned 18, he was welcomed back to Novgorod and ‚Äî together with his future son-in-law, Daumantas of Pskov ‚Äî led a local militia against Livonian Knights in the Battle of Rakvere. During the following decade, he struggled for control of Novgorod against his uncles, Yaroslav III and Vasily of Kostroma. In 1276, when his elders died, he finally ascended the coveted thrones of Vladimir and Novgorod. Two years later, he founded a great fortress of Koporye, which he intended to rule himself. The Novgorodians revolted, forcing Dmitry to leave Koporye and Novgorod altogether. While Dmitry was preoccupied with pacifying Novgorod, Andrey of Gorodets (Dmitry's younger brother) went to the Golden Horde and received from the khan permission to replace Dmitry as the Grand Prince. In 1281, Andrey returned to Russia, joined his forces with princes of Rostov and Yaroslavl and, after much devastation to Dmitry's lands, seized his capital Pereslavl. Dmitry fled to Koporye but, failing to win support of Novgorodians, had to retreat further northward, probably to Scandinavia. Two years later, Dmitry returned to Russia, only to find his lands ravaged by the Mongols and his brother Andrey. Thereupon he went to the Black Sea and met Nogai Khan, who was the greatest enemy of the Golden Horde at that time. Wishing to increase his authority in Russia, Nogai vowed to support Dmitry in his struggle for the grand ducal throne. On hearing about this, Andrey renounced his claims to Vladimir and Novgorod and returned to Gorodets. In 1285 Andrey again brought Mongol hordes to Russia, but these were expelled by Dmitry and his allies. Finally, in 1293 Andrey managed to unite the Mongols and Russian princes in opposition to Dmitry. Reluctant to renew fratricidal hostilities, Dmitry took monastic vows in 1293 and died the next year. He was buried in the Saviour Cathedral of Pereslavl-Zalessky. ==See also== * Rulers of Russia family tree ==External links== * Biography Category:1250 births Category:1294 deaths Category:Grand Princes of Vladimir Category:Eastern Orthodox monarchs Category:Rurik dynasty Category:Yurievichi family Category:13th-century princes in Kievan Rus' ","title":"Dmitry of Pereslavl"},{"id":"2232815","text":"The Peace and Progress Party was a British political party founded by Vanessa and Corin Redgrave to campaign for human rights. Combining the Redgraves, formerly leading figures in the Workers' Revolutionary Party and the Marxist Party, with others from the media and legal fields, the party campaigned for the rights of refugees and political dissidents. The party was launched in November 2004 and called for the withdrawal of British troops from Iraq, the return of British detainees from Guantanamo Bay and the cancellation of Third World debt. The party urged support from those in other parties, including the Conservatives, who upheld human rights. The party received the support of journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was later murdered, and of Azmat Begg, father of Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg, who stood for the party at the 2005 general election in Birmingham Hodge Hill. The party had suggested that Moazzem Begg and another detainee, Richard Belmar, would stand as absentee candidates. Babar Ahmad, wanted by the US authorities on terrorism charges, stood in Brent North. Peace and Progress made a negligible impact at the 2005 general election, losing their deposit in each of the three seats they stood in. Ahmad received 685 votes (1.9%), Amzat Begg received 329 votes (1.2%), and Sylvia Dunn received 22 votes (0.1%) in Folkestone and Hythe. According to the Electoral Commission the party's leader was Chris Cooper, Sue Conlan the nominating officer, and Edmund Quinn the treasurer. The party registered in 2003 and deregistered in 2015.

After their break-up, frontman Tim Rutili went on to form Califone, for which many of Red Red Meat's former members, including producer Brian Deck, often record and perform. Tim Hurley went on to form Sin Ropas. ==History== In 1984, Tim Rutili moved from the suburb of Addison, IL to Chicago in order to attend film school, where he met bassist Glynis Johnson. Together with Ben Massarella, their first band, Friends of Betty, attracted a reasonable following. The 1988 studio album Blind Faith II included drummer John Rowan. It was not much of a success. With new recruit Glenn Girard they renamed the band Red Red Meat. The band's name possibly came from Ben's Truck washing business which cleaned meat carrying trucks on their way out of Chicago. Regarding the band name, Tim Rutili said in an interview: \\"I think we just thought it sounded good.\\" Red Red Meat released their first single, \\"Hot Nikkety Trunk Monkey\\" b/w \\"Snowball\\" in 1991. They were recorded with Brad Wood at Idful Studios in Chicago. Engineer Brian Deck, who recorded the drums for the session, was asked to become a full-time member behind the kit, after the departure of Ben Massarella, who left for a job as a studio musician. It was during the recordings at Idful Studios with Brad Wood that Sub Pop director Jonathan Poneman decided to sign the band making them the first Chicago band on the label. During the summer of 1992, Red Red Meat toured with fellow Chicago group The Smashing Pumpkins. Glynis Johnson left the band after ending a romance between her and Rutili after the tour. Johnson would later contract A.I.D.S. and pass away due to complications that fall. The Smashing Pumpkins wrote a song \\"Glynis\\" as a tribute, which was released on \\"No Alternative\\" compilation. Sub Pop released Red Red Meat's second album in early 1994, Jimmywine Majestic. It was a step away from the grunge and general label characteristics of Sub Pop but was generally well received. Massarella returned, instead of replacing Brian Deck on drums, began employing his \\"batterie\\" techniques. In 1995 Red Red Meat returned with \\"Bunny Gets Paid\\", which, according to Sub Pop, \\"is easily one of the high points of the entire Sub Pop catalog.\\" In 1997 Red Red Meat released their final album, \\"There's a Star Above the Manger Tonight\\". Red Red Meat has since ended their contract with Sub Pop. They appeared in Scott Petersen's film Out of the Loop, which documents the Chicago indie rock scene. RRM's own Perishable label released Loftus in 1999. a collaboration with New York trio, Rex. Red Red Meat has since disbanded and each member has moved on to other projects. Tim Rutili along with several other Red Red Meat alumni founded Califone, a project which all Red Red Meat members have participated in at one point or another. Brian Deck currently is a music producer based in Chicago. ==Reunion== Though the band has never gone through an official break up, there have been several reunions throughout the years. In 2008 they returned for two shows, at the Hideout in Chicago and at the Sub Pop 25th Anniversary party. Talks of a possible album were thrown about, though nothing has developed and all Red Red Meat members have returned to their full-time positions. Red Red Meat played three shows in March 2009: two in Chicago followed by an appearance at the Sub Pop showcase at SXSW in Austin, TX. On March 24, 2009, Sub Pop released a deluxe edition of 1995's Bunny Gets Paid, which had been out of print for some years. It featured a 7-track 2nd disc with a previously unreleased song, \\"St. Anthony's Jawbone\\". ==Discography== *Red Red Meat (Perishable Records, 1992) *Jimmywine Majestic (Sub Pop Records, 1994) *Bunny Gets Paid (Sub Pop Records, 1995) *There's a Star Above the Manger Tonight (Sub Pop Records, 1997) ==References * Pastry Sharp - Official website contains lyrics, song downloads, and discussion * [ Bio at Allmusic] * OUT OF THE LOOP - Documentary on Chicago music scene inc.

() is a fjord in the Sunnm√∏re region of M√∏re og Romsdal county, Norway. It is located entirely in the Stranda Municipality. It is a -long branch off the Sunnylvsfjorden, which is a branch off the Storfjorden (Great Fjord). The small village of Geiranger is located at the end of the fjord where the Geirangelva river empties into it. ==The fjord== The Geiranger Fjord, a UNESCO World Heritage Site The fjord is one of Norway's most visited tourist sites. In 2005, it was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, jointly with the N√¶r√∏yfjorden. This status was challenged by the disputed plans to build power lines across the fjord. A car ferry, which doubles as a sightseeing trip, is operated by Fjord1 Nordvestlandske. It runs lengthwise along the fjord between the small towns of Geiranger and Hellesylt. The fjord is scheduled to require zero-emissions ships in 2026. Along the fjord's sides there lie a number of now-abandoned farms. Some restoration has been made by the Storfjordens venner association. The most commonly visited among these are Skagefl√•, Knivsfl√•, and Blomberg. Skagefl√• may also be reached on foot from Geiranger, while the others require a boat excursion. The fjord is also host to several impressive waterfalls such as Seven Sisters Falls. Magdalene Thoresen, Henrik Ibsen's mother-in-law, said of the area: > This fjord is surrounded by some of the steepest mountains on the entire > west coast. It is very narrow and has no habitable shore area, for the > precipitous heights rise in sheer and rugged strata almost straight out of > the water. Foaming waterfalls plunge into the fjord from jagged peaks. There > are, however, a few mountain farms here, and of these one or two have such > hazardous access, by paths that wind around steep precipices, and by bridges > that are fixed to the mountain with iron bolts and rings, that they bear > witness in a most striking way to the remarkable powers of invention which > the challenges of nature have developed in man.History about Bringe- > Ragnhild. ==Waterfalls== Seven Sisters (De syv s√∏strene) and the Suitor (Friaren) waterfalls. The two most notable waterfalls in the Geiranger Fjord are Seven Sisters Falls and the Suitor (Nynorsk Friaren). Both falls face one another across the fjord, and the Suitor is said to be trying to woo the sisters opposite. The Bridal Veil is another waterfall in the fjord, so named because it falls delicately over one rocky edge, and when seen backlit by the sun it has the appearance of a thin veil over the rocks. ==Rock slides== The Geiranger Fjord is under constant threat from the mountain √Ökerneset which is about to erode into the fjord. A collapse would produce a tsunami, hitting several nearby towns including Geiranger and Hellesylt in about ten minutes. == In popular culture == *The 2015 movie The Wave (B√∏lgen) is based on the premise of a rock slide from the mountain √Ökerneset inundating the town of Geiranger. *Frozen used the landscapes of the Geirangerfjord and N√¶r√∏yfjord as basis for the landscapes of Arendelle. == Gallery == GeirangerFjordNorwayFjord.jpgA historical photograph of the fjord with Seven Sisters Falls Fiordo de Geiranger, Noruega, 2019-09-07, DD 109-116 PAN.jpgGeiranger fjord from the water (panorama) Geirangerfjord sieben Schwestern.jpgSeven Sisters Falls making its way to the Geiranger Fjord 2011-08-04 22.48.42 Geiranger fjord from climb parking lot (panorama 5x).pngGeiranger fjord from climb parking lot (panorama) 2011-08-05 13.58.46 Geiranger fjord from Dalsnibba (zoom out).jpgGeiranger fjord from Dalsnibba (zoom out) 2011-08-05 13.44.10 Geiranger fjord from Dalsnibba.jpgGeiranger fjord from Dalsnibba (zoom in) Fiordo de Geiranger, Noruega, 2019-09-07, DD 30-34 PAN.jpgThe sight-seeing boat making a trip through the fjord Fiordo de Geiranger, Noruega, 2019-09-07, DD 35.jpgView from the water ==ReferencesGeiranger Tourist-Info * Destination Geirangerfjord - √Ölesund & Sunnm√∏re * Geirangerfjord - the official travel guide to Norway * Travel information Category:Stranda Category:Fjords of M√∏re og Romsdal Category:World Heritage Sites in Norway ","title":"Geirangerfjord"},{"id":"2232841","text":"George Welsh (August 26, 1933 ‚Äì January 2, 2019) was an American college football player and coach. He served as head football coach of the Navy Midshipmen football team of the United States Naval Academy from 1973 to 1981, and the Virginia Cavaliers football team of the University of Virginia from 1982 to 2000. Welsh retired as the winningest coach in ACC history. Although that record was later surpassed by Bobby Bowden of Florida State, Welsh remains far and away the most successful coach in UVA history (his 134 wins are more than double those of runner-up Al Groh). He was named ACC Coach of the Year four times (1983, 1984, 1991 and 1995) and National Coach of the Year once (1991). Upon Welsh's retirement after the 2000 season, his 189 career victories ranked him 24th in Division I-A history. Welsh was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 2004. ==Early life and career== Welsh was born in Coaldale, Pennsylvania. He played for the Navy Midshipmen from 1952 to 1955, and was a first-team All-American at quarterback in 1955. After graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1956, he served as an assistant coach under Rip Engle and Joe Paterno at Penn State from 1963 to 1972. ==Head coach at Navy== Welsh began his head coaching career at the U.S. Naval Academy in 1973. He inherited a Navy Midshipmen football program that had only had one winning season since the end of the Roger Staubach era. He led the Midshipmen to three bowl game appearances and their first nine-win season in 16 years. In nine seasons, Welsh compiled a record of 55‚Äì46‚Äì1. He left as Navy's all-time winningest coach, though he has since been passed by Ken Niumatalolo. ==Head coach at UVA== In 1982, Welsh left Navy to become the head coach of the Virginia Cavaliers, who had just finished a 1-10 season. He walked into a situation even worse than the one he had inherited at Navy. Prior to his arrival, Virginia had only two winning seasons in the previous 29 years and had never been to a post-season bowl game. The Cavaliers had also only one winning record in Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) play, had only finished higher than fourth twice, and had only won 33 conference games in 29 years of ACC play. Welsh turned around the program quickly. In his third season he led the Cavaliers to their first-ever bowl appearance, a victory in the 1984 Peach Bowl. In 1987, Virginia started a streak of 13 straight seasons with seven or more wins. This stretch included shared ACC titles in 1989 and 1995‚Äìto date, the only ACC titles in school history‚Äìand 11 additional bowl appearances. His teams also compiled four nine-win seasons, including a school-record 10 wins in 1989.

The Society of Dilettanti: archaeology and identity in the British enlightenment. New Haven: Published for the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art by Yale University Press, 2009. by a group of people who had been on the Grand Tour. Records of the earliest meeting of the society were written somewhat informally on loose pieces of paper. The first entry in the first minute book of the society is dated 5 April 1736. In 1743, Horace Walpole condemned its affectations and described it as \\"... a club, for which the nominal qualification is having been in Italy, and the real one, being drunk: the two chiefs are Lord Middlesex and Sir Francis Dashwood, who were seldom sober the whole time they were in Italy.\\"Horace Walpole, quoted in Jeremy Black, The British and the Grand Tour (1985), p120 The group, initially led by Francis Dashwood, contained several dukes and was later joined by Joshua Reynolds, David Garrick, Uvedale Price, and Richard Payne Knight, among others. It was closely associated with Brooks's, one of London's most exclusive gentlemen's clubs. The society quickly became wealthy, through a system in which members made contributions to various funds to support building schemes and archaeological expeditions. The first artist associated with the group was George Knapton. The Society of Dilettanti aimed to correct and purify the public taste of the country; from the 1740s, it began to support Italian opera. A few years before Sir Joshua Reynolds became a member, the group worked towards the objective of forming a public academy, and from the 1750s, it was the prime mover in establishing the Royal Academy. In 1775, the club had accumulated enough money towards a scholarship fund for the purpose of supporting a student's travel to Rome and Greece, or for archaeological expeditions such as that of Richard Chandler, William Pars, and Nicholas Revett, the results of which they published in Ionian Antiquities, a major influence on neo-Classicism in Britain. Among the publications published at the expense of the society was, The bronzes of Siris (London, 1836), by Danish archaeologist Peter Oluf Bronsted.The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol.III, London, 1847, Charles Knight, p.847 ==Membership== The society has 60 members, elected by secret ballot. An induction ceremony is held at Brooks's, an exclusive London gentleman's club. It makes annual donations to the British Schools in Rome and Athens, and a separate fund set up in 1984 provides financial assistance for visits to classical sites and museums. ===Notable members=== Society of Dilettanti.

He was the royal treasurer of ≈ûahin Giray, the last Crimean Khan, and therefore is called in Karaite literature ha-Neeman (\\"the Trusted\\")‚Äîan appellation bestowed also upon his father Samuel, who died in 1770, and who probably held the same office under former khans. When ≈ûahin Giray fled for his life from his rebellious subjects, and sought succor from his protectress Catherine II in St. Petersburg, Benjamin Aga followed him, hoping to collect the large sums of money that he had advanced to the fugitive. Following the last partition of Poland in 1795, after Crimea had been under Russian rule for over a decade, Vilnius, Lutsk and Trakai came under Russian Rule. Benjamin Aga, Solomon ben Nahamu Bobowitz, and the astronomer Isaac of Kalea, the son-in-law of Jacob Aga, who was the elder brother of Benjamin, went to St. Petersburg as a delegation from the Crimean Karaites, to petition the empress to release their sect from the double rate of taxation which all the Jews then had to pay. Through the intervention of Count Nikolay Zubov, the delegation obtained from the empress the exemption from the \\"Jewish\\" taxes, some land grants, and other privileges which had not been asked for. This established an important precedent for exempting the Karaites from subsequent anti-Jewish legislation. The extraordinary success of the mission served to arouse great enthusiasm among the Karaites, and Aga and his fellow delegates were received with great honor on their return. A large monolith, fashioned out of marble, with fitting inscription, was erected in the court of the kenesa at Eupatoria, to commemorate an event so important in the history of the Karaites of Russia. ==Bibliography== *Isaac of Kalea, Or ha-Lebanah, Zhytomir, 1882. ==References== * Category:Crimean Karaites Category:History of Crimea Category:1824 deaths Category:Year of birth missing ","title":"Benjamin Aga"},{"id":"2232859","text":"Joel Wapnick (born 1946) is a Scrabble player from Montreal, Quebec, Canada, best known for winning the 1999 World Scrabble Championship (WSC).

It is the traditional language of the Panyjima people. The name has also been spelled Bandjima, Banjima, Banyjima, Paanjima, Pandjima, Panjima, Panjtjima, and Panytyima. Like most indigenous Australian languages, Panyjima is endangered. Younger generations have English as a first language and make little distinction between Panyjima and its closely related neighbouring languages. There's a formal language register known as padupadu. ==Classification== Panyjima is classified as a member of the Ngayarta branch of the Pama‚ÄìNyungan languages. Under Carl Georg von Brandenstein's 1967 classification, Martuthunira was classed as an Inland Ngayarda language, but the separation of the Ngayarda languages into Coastal and Inland groups is no longer considered valid. ==PhonologyConsonants=== {  !rowspan=2 !colspan=2 Peripheral !colspan=2 Laminal !colspan=2 Apical - !

Prior to its 1983 release, the band members appeared on MTV without their trademark makeup. It was the first public appearance without make-up by the band, and their first for Mercury Records, where they had been signed following their departure from Casablanca Records. ==Album information== Lick It Up built upon the harder sound Kiss had displayed on 1982's Creatures of the Night. It was certified gold on December 22, 1983, the first Kiss album to achieve certification since 1980's Unmasked. This is partially attributable to the increased publicity the band received after their unmasking. As soon as the Creatures of the Night Tour/10th Anniversary Tour wrapped up in June, the band immediately went back into the studio to begin work on their next album, which was recorded over the next two months. \\"Lick It Up\\" and \\"All Hell's Breakin' Loose\\" were released as singles from the album. They were accompanied by a pair of similarly themed, tongue-in-cheek videos featuring the band (along with many scantily clad women) in desolate, post-apocalyptic settings. For the first time, Vinnie Vincent appeared on the cover art for the album, whereas Ace Frehley had appeared on the Creatures of the Night cover, despite having already left the band and not being involved in the recording of the album. Vincent was not legally a member of the band. Due partly to disputes over what his role in the band and his pay would be (some reports indicated that he had asked for, and was flatly denied, a percentage of the band's gross profits), Vincent never signed any contract making his employment official. These disputes, along with a growing attitude by him that he was solely responsible for the resurgence of Kiss, would lead to him leaving the band (or being fired, depending on the source) after the European leg of the Lick It Up tour. With the band unable to secure a replacement guitarist on such short notice, Vincent was enticed to return for the American leg of the tour; however, his refusal to sign his contract continued to be a sore point. A major rift developed between him and the rest of the band over his guitar solos. What were supposed to be 5‚Äì8 minute solos, timed to finish on a cue so that Paul Stanley could introduce the next song, suddenly extended in some instances, leaving the rest of the band impatiently waiting on stage for Vincent to finish. At an LA Forum show in January 1984, Vincent continued playing despite Stanley's cueing him to finish the solo. The two nearly came to blows in the dressing room afterward, with Stanley accusing Vincent of showing him up, and Vincent accusing the other three members of ruining his solo and trying to hold him back as a performer. They were separated by Eric Carr and Gene Simmons and a couple of roadies who tried to keep the peace. At a March show in Quebec, Canada, as the band prepared to close out their set, Vincent broke into an impromptu solo, leaving the other band members standing onstage with nothing to do. Vincent left (or was fired for a second time, depending on the source) shortly after. This time, the break was permanent. ‚ÄúYoung and Wasted‚Äù was occasionally performed with Eric Carr on lead vocals depending on the live show. Usually Stanley would introduce Carr after a brief drum solo, and lead into the segment with either Simmons or Carr performing lead vocals. \\"All Hell's Breakin' Loose\\" is one of three songs in the history of the band in which all four (current at the time) members share songwriting credit, the others being \\"Love Theme from Kiss\\" from their debut album and \\"Back to the Stone Age\\" from Monster. In an interview for KISSology 2, Stanley made the statement that, \\"People were now listening with their eyes rather than their ears, mainly because Creatures of the Night was arguably a better album than Lick It Up. He also made the statement that, \\"The only reason why I think people bought Lick It Up more than Creatures of the Night was because we had no make-up on. That was the only reason.\\" While Vincent contributed lead guitar to six songs on Creatures of the Night as a session player, by the time Lick it Up was released and for all the public knew, he was officially the guitarist in Kiss and played all the lead guitar on the album. The opening track (co-written by Vincent) features a solo from Rick Derringer. ==Reception and legacy== Lick It Up was certified platinum on December 19, 1990. It was placed at #10 on Guitar World's Readers Poll of the Top-10 Guitar Albums of 1983.Guitar World Readers Poll of the Top 10 Guitar Albums of 1983. Retrieved August 24, 2011. Kerrang! listed Lick It Up #3 on its list of the best hard rock albums in 1983. The album marked a turnaround in the band's flagging fortunes during the previous several years and successfully introduced them to a new generation of fans, as well as marking the beginning of the \\"unmasked\\" era that would last for the next decade. Stanley has stated in some interviews that he felt that the album sold well mainly due to the hype surrounding the band's unmasking. The Lick It Up World Tour began in October, one month after the album's release, and focused on Europe during the autumn, with the US leg taking place from December to March. The American leg of the tour has been seen as commercially disappointing by writer Kurt Gooch, who has believed that Kiss alienated many longtime fans by eschewing the iconic makeup.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2AjfjCpVpg The title track \\"Lick It Up\\" remains a staple of the ensemble's live performances, having been played over 1,300 times as of August 2015; however, the rest of the album is rarely played live. ==Track listingPersonnel== Kiss *Paul Stanley ‚Äì rhythm guitar, lead vocals *Gene Simmons ‚Äì bass guitar, lead vocals *Vinnie Vincent ‚Äì lead guitar, backing vocals, additional vocals on \\"Lick It Up\\" and \\"And on the 8th Day\\" *Eric Carr ‚Äì drums, percussion, backing vocals Additional musician *Rick Derringer ‚Äì lead guitar on \\"Exciter\\" ==Charts== Album { border=\\"1\\" !scope=\\"col\\"Chart (1983) !scope=\\"col\\"Peak position - Australian Albums Chart align=\\"center\\"36 - Austrian Albums ChartKISS - Lick It Up - swisscharts.com align=\\"center\\"13 - Canadian Albums Chart align=\\"center\\"46 - Dutch Albums Chart align=\\"center\\"14 - align=\\"left\\"Finnish Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"7 - French Albums Chart align=\\"center\\"17 - German Albums Chart align=\\"center\\"18 - Icelandic Albums Chart align=\\"center\\"5 - Japanese Albums Chart align=\\"center\\"15 - Norwegian Albums Chart align=\\"center\\"7 - align=\\"left\\"Spanish Albums Chart align=\\"center\\"24 - Swedish Albums Chart align=\\"center\\"3 - Swiss Albums Chart align=\\"center\\"10 - UK Albums ChartKISS  full Official Chart History  Official Charts Company align=\\"center\\"7 -  US Billboard Albums align=\\"center\\"24 } Singles {  - !Single !Chart (1983) !Peak position - rowspan=\\"5\\"\\"Lick It Up\\" US Billboard Hot 100  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"66 - Canada Pop Singles  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"32 - France Pop Singles  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"58 - Switzerland Pop Singles  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"24 - UK Pop Singles  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"31 } ==CertificationsReferences== Category:Kiss (band) albums Category:1983 albums Category:Albums produced by Gene Simmons Category:Albums produced by Paul Stanley Category:Casablanca Records albums Category:Mercury Records albums ","title":"Lick It Up"},{"id":"2232888","text":"Carl Wilhelm Erich Zimmer (Sondershausen, September 29, 1873 ‚Äì H√ºll bei Wolnzach, November 8, 1950) was a [German zoologist specialising in crustaceans, especially the order Cumacea.

Accessed 29 March 2007. ==History== Heron Mill, Hollinwood Historically part of Lancashire, Hollinwood in pre-industrial times was a moor or common on the borders of Chadderton and Oldham. The rights to the land were disputed by the townships with Chadderton claiming 8 acres, but a 1713 court settlement stipulated that Hollinwood Moor should be within Oldham.https://archive.org/details/localnotesandgl00unkngoog Local Notes and Gleanings, 1888 Retrieved 30 March 2016 The mid to late 18th century saw Hollinwood develop into a village. Mid 19th century gazetteers described Hollinwood as 'an extensive village in the townships of Chadderton and Oldham'. In 1880 there were further exchanges of land in the Hollinwood area between Oldham Borough and Chadderton township. James Butterworth (1826) described it as being of 66.5 Cheshire acres (approx. 140 statute acres). It was enclosed by the Oldham Enclosure Acts (42 and 43 George III; May 1802). Hollinwood's mills such as the Heron, Fox, Asia, Wharf, Richmond and Park were later built on what had been the Hollinwood Common. The Chapel Road playing fields is one of the few open spaces remaining in the district. The pitches occupy the site of a former reservoir serving a now-defunct stretch of the Hollinwood Branch Canal. The Roxy Cinema was demolished in 2007. Long existing as an industrial district, Hollinwood is today home to the Northern Counties Housing Association,Northern Counties Housing Association Limited , housingcorp.gov.uk, accessed 28 March 2007. and Mirror Colour Print Ltd; the printing division of the Trinity Mirror group, which prints and distributes thirty-six major newspapers, and employs five hundred staff.Oldham's Economic Profile ‚Äì Printing & Publishing , oldham.gov.uk. Accessed 19 March 2007. From the late 19th century, the area was largely occupied by workers in Oldham's cotton mills and miners at the large collieries at Oak and Bower, and several smaller ones. Much of Hollinwood's more recent growth was due to the Ferranti factory which produced power transformers in its heyday. Later the factory produced container lifting trucks as the building had the height to do so. The transformer works building, built after the war on the old Bower site, is now used as a newspaper printing plant. A neighbouring, much older, Ferranti factory produced electricity meters. The meter factory was sold to Siemens in the 1980s and became known as FML; Siemens later closed the FML factory. Hollinwood was struck by an F1/T2 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.http://www.eswd.eu/cgi-bin/eswd.cgi The tornado later moved over Oldham town centre, causing further damage. Until its closure in 2005 Hollinwood was home to the popular Roxy Cinema. The Roxy opened on 20 December 1937 screening the film 'Fire Over England'. Seating was provided in stalls and circle levels for 1,406 and there was a cinema cafe. In 1978 the cinema was split into two screens, then in 1981 it became a three screen cinema. Further sub-division occurred to create six screens which seated:470, 130, 260, 260 320 and 96. In 1998 a seventh screen was added. In 2002 the Roxy received a ¬£100,000 upgrade. After closure the Roxy was subsequently demolished in February 2007.http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/13439 Retrieved 30 April 2019 Several other cinemas existed in the Hollinwood area during the early to mid 20th century period including the La Scala and The Queens. ==Governance== This milestone, part of the Smut Inn public house, indicates the distance between Oldham and Manchester Town Hall. The Bowling Green Inn, Hollinwood The now closed Smut Inn, Top of Hollinwood Hollinwood was once a chapelry of the ecclesiastical parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham, in the Hundred of Salford. The Parish Church, St. Margret of Antioch is still under the patronage of the Rector of Prestwich, though this position is currently suspended. Until local government re-organisation in 1974, part of Hollinwood lay within the Chadderton Urban District in the administrative county of Lancashire. This area is now divided between the Hollinwood and South Chadderton ward districts. As part of the town of Oldham, Hollinwood forms part of the wider Metropolitan Borough of Oldham. Politically, the Hollinwood ward is currently represented by the Labour Party with three councillors. The boundaries of the Hollinwood ward were changed in 2003 following a Boundary Commission review. The part of Hollinwood lying west of the M60 motorway now lies in Failsworth East ward while part of Oldham St Paul's ward was transferred to Hollinwood. The ward currently comprises the rest of Hollinwood and the adjoining localities of Hollins, Garden Suburb and Limeside (also known as Limehurst Village). Hollinwood is part of the parliamentary constituency of Oldham West and Royton. ==Geography== Hollinwood is included in the 5% most economically deprived wards in the United Kingdom.The Ritchie Report ; Oldhamir.org.uk, 11 December 2001, accessed 18 September 2006. The Hollinwood Branch Canal used to pass through the district. The last vestiges of the canal in Hollinwood were destroyed by the works for the M60 motorway. Those parts of the branch canal which still exist are not in Hollinwood. Hollinwood was changed substantially by the M60 motorway (completed in 2000) which passes to the south of Manchester. ==Religion St Margaret of Antioch (Church of England) === Prior to 1760, the villagers of Hollinwood would have to travel to Oldham St Mary's for services. The emergence of a village at Hollinwood during the mid 18th century necessitated the building of a church there. The new church dedicated to St. Margaret of Antioch (Church of England) was completed by 1768 and was consecrated by the Bishop of Chester on 8 July 1769. The builder was Edmund Whitehead, and an account of his work was recorded on his gravestone in the churchyard. It is said that the cost of building was only ¬£500 and that a grant towards this was received from Queen Anne's Bounty. The church was smaller than the present building and when built had no tower, the current church building dating from 1877. A tower was added in 1904. The church is a grade II listed building. Recent years has seen further restoration. Grants from English Heritage, the Heritage Lottery Fund, National Churches Trust and others have allowed the church to complete two major restoration projects to date: phase one ‚Äì restoration of the tower, and phase two ‚Äì the replacement and restoration of the roofs of the north aisle, nave, transept, chancel and sacristy.http://www.magsnchads.org.uk/retrieved 28 August 2015 Further funding for urgent roof restoration work was secured in 2017, saving the church from closure.http://www.theoldhamtimes.co.uk/news/15773079.Grade_II_listed_church_saved_from_closure_after_welcome_cash_injection/?ref=mr&lp;=3 Oldham Times.

The Hollinwood Congregational Church (earlier in its history known as The Memorial Church or Chapel) was situated on the corner where Pump Street intersected with Manchester Road. The church building faced onto Manchester Road with the Sunday School building behind it taking the length of Pump Street. In view of plans for the motorway and declining numbers the church building was sold and the church united with Beulah Baptist Church where the members continue to meet and worship. The building, which had become a warehouse, has since been demolished. It was well known because of the prominence of its clock tower.http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/LAN/Hollinwood/TheMemorialChurch.shtml St James (Free Church of England). It was founded in 1870.

The Adventures of NYC's Billionaire Playboy. New York Post. When Parker was seven, his father taught him how to program on an Atari 800. Parker's father, who put his family before his entrepreneurial dreams, told Parker \\"if you are going to take risks, take them early before you have a family.\\" As a teenager, Parker's hobbies were hacking and programming. One night, while hacking into the network of a Fortune 500 company, Parker was unable to log out after his father confiscated his computer keyboard. Because his IP address was exposed, F.B.I. agents tracked down the 16-year-old. Since Parker was under 18, he was sentenced to community service. ==Education== Parker attended Oakton High School in Fairfax County, Virginia for two years before transferring to Chantilly High School in 1996 for his junior and senior years. While there, Parker wrote a letter to the school administration and persuaded them to count the time he spent coding in the computer lab as a foreign language class. As a result, towards the end of Parker's senior year at Chantilly, he was mostly writing code and starting companies. He graduated in 1998. While still in high school, he interned for Mark Pincus (the CEO of Zynga) at Pincus's Washington D.C. startup FreeLoader.Tsotsis, Alexia. Mark Pincus Used To Be Sean Parker's Boss. TechCrunch.

At Facebook's f8 conference that year, Parker announced a partnership between Facebook and Spotify, which allowed users to share their Spotify playlists on their Facebook profiles. ===Brigade Media=== In April 2014, Parker announced his backing of a new initiative called Brigade, an online platform for civic engagement to \\"combat a lack of political engagement and interest in all levels of government across America\\". Parker serves as the Executive Chairman of Brigade. The initial round of funding was $9.3 million from Parker, with additional sums from other investors. In 2014, Brigade acquired Causes, an online platform for social impact and political activism. Causes had in 2013 acquired Votizen, a political advocacy startup. Parker and The Founders Fund were a part of Votizen's $1.5 million funding round in 2010, and Parker served on the board of directors. He has stated, \\"Politics for me is the most obvious area [to be disrupted by the Web].\\" ==Philanthropy== Since 2005, Parker has been an active donor to cancer research, global public health and civic engagement. In 2012, he pledged a $5 million grant to Stand Up to Cancer and the Cancer Research Institute to create the Immunotherapy Dream Team, uniting laboratory and clinical efforts that will lead to the immunological treatment, control and prevention of cancer. In December 2014, Parker pledged $24 million to create the Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy Research at Stanford. In 2015, he made a $4.5 million grant to support the Malaria Elimination Initiative at the University of California San Francisco's Global Health Group, and a $10 million grant to create the Sean N. Parker Autoimmune Research Laboratory at UCSF. Parker is an active supporter of groups including Code for America, Stand up to Cancer, the Cancer Research Institute, Malaria No More, the Clinton Foundation, ONE, and the \\"charity: water\\" campaign.Arrington, Michael.

It takes an interdisciplinary approach to large-scale challenges, combining insight, capital, science and technology, organization building and public policy. ===Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy=== Parker donated $250 million to create the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, in April 2016. The funds initially went to over 300 scientists at 40 laboratories, in 6 institutions. Starting in 2016, the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy scientists funded a clinical trial to test the next wave of cancer-fighting T-cells engineered using the CRISPR gene-editing technology. The trial was the first in the United States to test CRISPR-modified cells in humans. The trial is led by the University of Pennsylvania and is also conducted at University of California, San Francisco and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. In November 2017, Science published a study from Parker Institute researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center showing that melanoma patients who have specific types of bacteria and greater microbial diversity in their gut microbiome responded better to an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor versus those with less diversity. Based on this work, the Parker Institute is collaborating with MD Anderson and industry partner Seres Therapeutics to launch a microbiome-cancer immunotherapy clinical trial for advanced melanoma patients. ===Board Memberships=== Parker also serves on the boards of the following non- profits * Obama FoundationObama Foundation Announces Addition of Sean Parker to the Board of Directors Obama.org * Global CitizenBoard of Directors: Sean Parker Globalcitizen.org * Parker Institute for Cancer ImmunotherapyBoard for Parker Institute ParkerICI.org * Parker FoundationFoundation website * Museum of Contemporary Art, Los AngelesNew Director Expands MOCA‚Äôs Board With Four Global Members NYTimes.com ===Awards=== In February 2015, Parker was ranked number 5 on the Chronicle of Philanthropy's 2014 Philanthropy 50 list. In August 2018, Parker was nominated as a Wired Magazine \\"Icon\\" along with Alex Marson for his research in DNA programming and genome editing in the fight against cancer. He's also been named one of Town and Country's Top 50 Philanthropists and was named in Time Magazine's Healthcare 50 for his work in connecting cancer research. In 2016, he was given the \\"Pontifical Key Philanthropy Award\\" by Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi at the Vatican for his cancer work. == Political donations and activism == Parker has made substantial donations to both sides of U.S. party politics; his allegedly \\"non-partisan\\" approach favors contributions to \\"elected officials who have shown themselves willing to work across the aisle\\". He favored Democrats as well as progressive causes such as campaign finance reform and gun control; he has spoken out in favor of higher taxes, particularly for the \\"wealthy and super wealthy,\\" and in favor of higher capital gains taxes. Parker has also supported middle-of-the-road Republican candidates and super PACs, favoring \\"economically moderate\\" conservatives and candidates with a demonstrated interest in compromise and deal-making. In Washington, he has met with Republican lawmakers about ways of encouraging economic investment in struggling areas of the country. He has also supported cannabis law reform and in 2010, following the example of donations by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz (totaling $70,000) donated $100,000 to the 2010 California Proposition 19 campaign to legalize marijuana in that state and $400,000 to the Democratic Party backed 2016 California Proposition 63 campaign to require background checks for all ammunition purchases. Parker will donate $250 million to launch a new institute aimed at developing more effective cancer treatments by fostering collaboration among leading researchers in the field. For the 2016 presidential election, Parker created a social ballot guide for voters to help each other pledge to vote. Parker was also a driving force behind the Opportunity Zones provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 which are designed to incentivize investments in struggling American communities.Tankersley, Jim (January 29, 2018). \\"Tucked Into the Tax Bill, a Plan to Help Distressed America\\".

The couple has a daughter, Winter Victoria Parker, born on January 6, 2013,\\"Sean Parker, Facebook Billionaire, Welcomes Baby Girl With Fiancee Alexandra Lenas\\", Us Weekly, January 7, 2013. and a son, Zephyr Emerson Parker, born on December 1, 2014. === Big Sur wedding=== On June 1, 2013, Parker married Alexandra Lenas in Big Sur, California, in a wedding at which every guest was given a Lord of the Rings‚Äìstyle costume. The wedding purportedly cost $10 million to stage, though Parker describes this estimate as \\"WAY off base\\". The wedding was the subject of an article in The Atlantic alleging environmental damage to the redwood forest to which Parker responded in detail, highlighting his cooperation with the Save the Redwoods League throughout. A required permit was not obtained. In addition, the venue from which he hired the space was not permitted to close it to the public. A California Coastal Commission spokesperson said \\"Mr Parker, in essence, leased an ongoing Coastal Act violation when he leased the campground\\". As part of his settlement with the Commission, Parker gave $2.5 million and created a beach-mapping app.Alexander, Kurtis (October 17, 2014) \\"Sean Parker's Big Sur punishment ‚Äî create an app.\\" San Francisco Chronicle.

She was a proponent of political freedom for women, and believed in the ideology of self-improvement through education, something she called \\"levelling up.\\" This made her hugely popular with the working class public in both England and America. == Childhood == Eliza Cook was the youngest of the eleven children of a brazier (a brass- worker) living in London Road, Southwark, where she was born. When she was about nine years old her father retired from business, and the family went to live at a small farm in St. Leonard's Forest, near Horsham. Her mother encouraged Eliza's fondness for imaginative literature, and despite attending the local Sunday school the child was almost entirely self-educated. At Sunday School she was encouraged by the music master's son to produce her first volume of poetry. She began to write verses before she was fifteen, contributing to the Weekly Dispatch and New Monthly, and published her first poetry collection two years later; indeed, some of her most popular poems, such as \\"I'm afloat\\" and the \\"Star of Glengarry,\\" were composed in her girlhood. ==Career == Her first volume, Lays of a Wild Harp, appeared in 1835, when she was only seventeen. Encouraged by its favourable reception, she began to send verses anonymously to the Weekly Dispatch, the Metropolitan Magazine, the New Monthly Magazine, and The Literary Gazette; William Jerdan sang her praises in the last of these. After a time she confined herself to the radical Weekly Dispatch, where her first contribution had appeared under the signature 'C.' on 27 Nov 1836, and she became a staple of its pages for the next ten years. Its editor was William Johnson Fox and its owner was James Harmer, a London alderman.http://www.harmer.org/Alderman_James_Harmer.pdf harmer.org She lived for a time at Harmer's residence, Ingress Abbey, in Greenhithe, Kent,http://www.garyvaughanpostcards.co.uk/ingress_abbey_20.html?frm_data1=32&frm;_data1_type=large The Gary Vaughan Collection and wrote certain of her works there.http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-172722-ingress-abbey- swanscombe-and-greenhithe- British Listed Buildings Her poem The Old Armchair (1838) made hers a household name for a generation, both in England and the United States. In that year, she published Melaia and other Poems. Her work for the Dispatch and New Monthly was pirated by George Julian Harney, the Chartist, for the Northern Star. Familiar with the London Chartist movement in its various sects, she followed many of the older radicals in disagreeing with the O'Brienites and O'Connorites in their disregard for the repeal of the Corn Laws. She also preferred the older Radicals' path of Friendly Societies and self-education. From 1849 to 1854 she wrote, edited, and published Eliza Cook's Journal, a weekly periodical she described as one of \\"utility and amusement.\\" The periodical was described as having \\"variety, piquancy, benevolent aim, and hardly had a superior\\" in comparison to other periodicals of the time. Although some found solace in Cook's work, the periodical was short lived due to lack of appreciation among the majority. After a noble struggle to keep the periodical afloat and through health issues the periodical ultimately fell. Cook went on to publish Jottings from my Journal (1860), where a lot of Eliza Cook's Journal's contents reappeared. This publication was one of the few times Cook wrote in prose. It included many essays and sketches that were written in a clear and simple manner, usually conveying a moral lesson for the reader. Some of the essays are \\"mild satires on the social failings of her contemporaries,\\" and exhibit good sense and even some humor. She also published, New Echoes and Other Poems (1864), which showed more limited power when compared to her previous work and therefore did not find as much success as her previous efforts. Despite a lack of interest in her later works, Eliza Cook still had become a staple of anthologies throughout the century. ==Views== At the time Cook was a Chartist, one of \\"a body of 19th century English political reformers advocating better social and industrial conditions for the working classes.\\" The goal of Chartist poetry is to create a sense of camaraderie for the people within a vast community who found themselves oppressed and suffering. In her poem \\"A Song for the Workers,\\" Cook emphasizes the importance of shorter working hours. Within this poem she goes on to compare the treatment of laborers to that of the slaves in America. In another poem, \\"Our Father,\\" Cook speaks out against child labor at the time and once again compares child labor to slavery. She also implies how children working such vigorous jobs turn their brains \\"dull and torpid,\\" engaged in hard tasks that do not allow them to be children. Along with these views Cook was a proponent of political and sexual freedom for women, and believed in the ideology of self-improvement through education, something she called \\"levelling up.\\" This made her a great favourite with the working-class public. Not much is known about Cook's view on sexuality; however, through speculation researchers would infer that Eliza Cook and some of her readers were lesbian women. Her peers described her as having short \\"boyish\\" hair, a \\"mannish appearance,\\" and mentioned that she wore lapelled jackets which showed off her shirt front and ruffles, described as \\"a very masculine style, which was considered strange at the time.\\" ==Later life== She was a close friend and lover of the American actress Charlotte Cushman.http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi- bin/paperspast?a=d&d;=NZH18801015.2.31 Recollections of Eliza CookLesbian Histories and Cultures: An Encyclopedia, Volume 1, p 217 Cook and Cushman sometimes wore matching dresses, a practice to symbolize their friendship and \\"difference from heterosexual women.\\" On June 18, 1863 Eliza Cook received a Civil List pension of ¬£100 a year. Afterwards she published only a few poems in the Weekly Dispatch, and quickly became what was described as a \\"confirmed invalid.\\" Despite her loss in popularity, she still collected royalties from her publishers almost up to the end of her life. In the 1870 census she is recorded as living at Beech House, 23 Thornton Hill, Wimbledon, Surrey, along with a maid, Mary A. Bowles, her sister Mary Fyall, nephew Alfred Pyall, his wife Harriet, and their daughters Mary and Jane.\\"Eliza Cook.\\" Census Returns of England and Wales, 1871.

Located at the base of a bird's trachea, it produces sounds without the vocal folds of mammals. The sound is produced by vibrations of some or all of the membrana tympaniformis (the walls of the syrinx) and the pessulus, caused by air flowing through the syrinx. This sets up a self- oscillating system that modulates the airflow creating the sound. The muscles modulate the sound shape by changing the tension of the membranes and the bronchial openings. The syrinx enables some species of birds (such as parrots, crows, and mynas) to mimic human speech. Unlike the larynx in mammals, the syrinx is located where the trachea forks into the lungs. Thus, lateralization is possible, with muscles on the left and right branch modulating vibrations independently so that some songbirds can produce more than one sound at a time. Some species of birds, such as New World vultures, lack a syrinx and communicate through throaty hisses. Birds do have a larynx, but unlike in mammals, it does not vocalize. The position of the syrinx, structure and musculature varies widely across bird groups. In some groups the syrinx covers the lower end of the trachea and the upper parts of the bronchi in which case the syrinx is said to be tracheobronchial, the most frequent form and the one found in all songbirds. The syrinx may be restricted to the bronchi as in some non-passerines, notably the owls, cuckoos and nightjars. The syrinx may also be restricted to the trachea and this is found in a very small number of bird groups that are sometimes known as tracheophonae, a subset of the suboscine passeriformes that include Furnariidae (ovenbirds), Dendrocolaptidae (woodcreepers), Formicariidae (ground antbirds), Thamnophilidae (typical antbirds), Rhinocryptidae (tapaculos), and Conopophagidae (gnateaters). The trachea are covered in partly ossified rings known as tracheal rings. Tracheal rings tend to be complete, while the bronchial rings are C shaped and the unossified part has smooth muscles running along them. The trachea are usual circular or oval in cross section in most birds but are flattened in ibises. The trachea is simple and tubular in ducks. The last few tracheal rings and the first few bronchial rings may fuse to form what is called the tympanic box. At the base of the trachea and at the joint of the bronchi a median dorsoventral structure, the pessulus, may be developed to varying extents. The pessulus is bony in passerines and provides attachment to membranes, anteriorly to the semilunar membranes. The membrane that forms part of the first three bronchial rings is responsible for vibrating and producing the sound in most passerines. These membranes may also be attached to the pessulus. In some species like the hill-myna, Gracula religiosa, there is wide gap between the second and third bronchial semirings where large muscles are attached, allowing the inner diameter to be varied widely. Other muscles are also involved in syringeal control, these can be intrinsic or extrinsic depending on whether they are within the syrinx or attached externally. The extrinsic muscles include the sternotrachealis from the sternum.

The name derives from Portuguese d√≥bra, meaning \\"doubloon.\\" ==CoinsFirst dobra=== In 1977, coins were introduced for 50 c√™ntimos, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 dobras. Except for the brass 50 c√™ntimos and 1 dobra, these coins were struck in cupro-nickel, as was the 50 dobras introduced in 1990. These coins depicted a combination of food produce and local flora and fauna. These coins, although seldom seen in circulation today due to chronic inflation have never been demonetized and can still be used as tender. In 1997, a new coin series with larger denominations was introduced consisting of 100, 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 dobras. Of these, the 100 and 250 dobras are round, the larger of the three are equilaterally curved heptagonal. These coins were all struck in nickel-plated steel and depict wildlife-related themes. All circulating coins bear the country's coat of arms on the obverse, with the text \\"Aumentemos a Produ√ß√£o\\" and the valuation on the reverse. ===Second dobra=== With the redenomination of the dobra in 2018, coins were introduced in denominations of 10, 20, and 50 c√™ntimos and 1 and 2 dobras. ==BanknotesFirst dobra=== On 30 September 1977, notes were introduced for 50, 100, 500 and 1000 dobras by the Banco Nacional de S√£o Tom√© e Pr√≠ncipe. In 1996, 5000, 10,000, 20,000 and 50,000 dobras notes were introduced, with the lowest denomination notes from the previous series being replaced by coins in 1997. A new issue was released in 2006 with upgraded security features. In December 2008, the 100,000 dobras note was introduced as continuous inflation deemed the new denomination necessary. The note has been very well received and accepted by the general public. All notes bear the portrait of Rei Amador on the obverse, however, on the 100,000 dobras note is the printed portrait of Francisco Jos√© Tenreiro. ===Second dobra=== Banknotes of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 dobras were issued in 2018 with the redenomination of the dobra.

Until its cancellation in November 2013, his program The War Room with Quinn and Rose was aired on 12 stations across the U.S. and was also heard on XM Satellite Radio Channel 244 from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday. ==Disc jockey and novelty host== Before beginning his political morning show, Quinn spent a number of years at KQV in the 1960s and 1970s, where he befriended his eventual political mentor Rush Limbaugh. Limbaugh worked at KQV and at WIXZ in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, as a disc jockey under the name Jeff Christie. Quinn is best remembered in the Pittsburgh area as the vociferous nighttime host on KQV radio in the 1960s, during the station's peak as a Top 40 power. Quinn was hired from WING/Dayton in 1967 and had an immediate impact on the market. In 1968, he jumped at an opportunity to take a job at WIBG Radio 99 in Philadelphia, but was back at KQV in less than a year. He stayed until 1972, then spent time in New York City at WPIX-FM.Jeff Roteman's KQV Page He then moved to Buffalo, New York, where in the late 1970s he became known to listeners throughout the northeast on WWKB (WKBW at the time), a 50,000-watt station that took requests from as far away as Norway.Rock Radio Scrapbook Quinn's final hour included a trivia game called \\"Stump The Audience\\", where the answers had been kept \\"in a sealed envelope on Funk and Wagnalls' doorstep since noon today\\". In an emotional farewell as he returned to Pittsburgh, Quinn said, \\"May I get lockjaw if I ever forget how much I appreciate the people who listen.\\" A Pittsburgh station, 13Q or WKTQ, lured him back in 1977 to capture the adults who had grown up listening to him on KQV. During his tenure at 13Q, Quinn issued a parody 45 rpm record of the then Top 40 hit \\"Undercover Angel\\" entitled \\"Undercover Pothole\\"; the parody lamented the atrocious condition of Pittsburgh roads during that period. In 1979 Quinn moved to the midday slot at WTAE radio, an adult contemporary station in Pittsburgh, under the aegis of General Manager Ted Atkins (\\"Captain Showbiz\\"). In 1983, he became half of \\"The Quinn and Banana Show\\" alongside Don Jefferson on B-94 FM, which ran in Pittsburgh until 1992. Their format was bathroom humor. After a course of conduct wherein they implied that News Director Liz Randolph was promiscuous, she sued the station and Quinn and Banana for defamation and sexual harassment. On Valentine's Day 1990, Randolph won on all counts, and a jury awarded her $694,000. Three years later, his FM morning show was canceled. Quinn largely credits this lawsuit with \\"opening his eyes\\" and inducing his conversion to political conservatism. ==Talk show host== After Quinn's program was canceled on B-94, he moved in 1993 to WRRK, where he gradually adopted his conservative political talk format. The program started in music format with Quinn as D.J., as Quinn in the Morning. But increasingly during breaks in music and during news reading he would editorialize. With the positive response he got from callers, and with increased ratings vs. the dominant a.m. radio The DVE Morning Show on WDVE(with Scott Paulson and Jim Krenn), the format eventually became entirely talk, focusing on conservative views of current events, and remained the only talk show on an otherwise music radio format. The program eventually moved to WPGB radio in 2004 when that station adopted an all talk format that included conservative nationally syndicated shows like The Rush Limbaugh Show. Given the nature of his politics, the show was always locally controversial based on political affiliation. By 2008, Quinn's inflammatory language had earned him notoriety; for example, the Bill Moyers Journal on PBS noted he referred to the National Organization for Women as the \\"National Organization for Whores\\", which was often reported out of its full context, since Quinn would continue \\"...they're whores for liberal politics in general, and they were whores for Bill Clinton in particular.\\"https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/09122008/transcript1.html The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that as of November 18, 2013, Quinn and his radio partner, Rose Somma Tennent, had been removed from the WPGB lineup. Quinn is a proponent of a constitutional government that adheres to the guiding principles of the nation's founders. He champions a smaller federal government and free markets. He regularly equates modern Left Liberalism with Marxism. He commonly refers to \\"Quinn's Laws\\", a collection of statements that sum up his world view, such as \\"Liberalism always generates the exact opposite of its stated intent\\" (e.g., the War on Poverty has led to even greater poverty).Quick Start Guide to the Quinn and Rose Show He also has many personal views he is fond of voicing, such as \\"liberty is the solution to the human condition\\". The show, broadcast with co-host Rose Somma Tennent (aka \\"Radio Rose\\"), aired live weekdays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. EST on certain affiliates and on XM Satellite Radio Channel 244; others replay the first hour after 9.

The term was taken up by Russian literary scholar M.M. Bakhtin who used it as a central element in his theory of meaning in language and literature. The term itself comes from the Russian , which in turn is derived from the Greek ' ('time') and ' ('space'); it thus can be literally translated as \\"time-space.\\" Bakhtin developed the term in his 1937 essay \\"Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel\\" (). Here Bakhtin showed how different literary genres operated with different configurations of time and space, which gave each genre its particular narrative character. For example, the chronotopic frame of the epic differed from that of the hero adventure or the comedy. == Definition == In the philosophy of language and philology, Bakhtin scholars Caryl Emerson and Michael Holquist state that the chronotope is \\"a unit of analysis for studying language according to the ratio and characteristics of the temporal and spatial categories represented in that language\\". Specific chronotopes are said to correspond to particular genres, or relatively stable ways of speaking, which themselves represent particular worldviews or ideologies. To this extent, a chronotope is both a cognitive concept and a narrative feature of language. In \\"Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel,\\" Bakhtin defines the chronotope thus: == Examples == The concept of the chronotope has been most widely used in literary studies. The scholar Timo M√ºller for example argued that analysis of chronotopes highlights the environmental dimension of literary texts because it draws attention to the concrete physical spaces in which stories take place. M√ºller discusses the chronotope of the road, which for Bakhtin was a meeting place but in recent literature no longer brings people together in this way because automobiles have changed the way we perceive the time and space of the road. Car drivers want to minimize the time they spend on the road. They are rarely interested in the road as a physical space, the natural environment around the road, or the environmental implications of their driving. This contrasts with earlier literary examples such as Robert Frost's poem \\"The Road Not Taken\\" or John Steinbeck's novel The Grapes of Wrath, where the road is described as part of the natural environment and the travelers are interested in that environment.; Linguistic anthropologist Keith Basso invoked \\"chronotopes\\" in discussing Western [Apache] stories linked with places. In the 1980s when Basso was writing, geographic features reminded the Western Apache of \\"the moral teachings of their history\\" by recalling to mind events that occurred there in important moral narratives. By merely mentioning \\"it happened at [the place called] 'men stand above here and there,'\\" storyteller Nick Thompson could remind locals of the dangers of joining \\"with outsiders against members of their own community.\\" Geographic features in the Western Apache landscape are chronotopes, Basso says, in precisely the way Bakhtin defines the term when he says they are \\"points in the geography of a community where time and space intersect and fuse. Time takes on flesh and becomes visible for human contemplation; likewise, space becomes charged and responsive to the movements of time and history and the enduring character of a people. ...Chronotopes thus stand as monuments to the community itself, as symbols of it, as forces operating to shape its members' images of themselves\\" (qtd. in Basso 1984: 44‚Äì45). Anthropologist of syncretism Safet Had≈æiMuhamedoviƒá built upon Bakhtin‚Äôs term in his ethnography of the Field of Gacko in the southeastern Bosnian highlands. In Waiting for Elijah: Time and Encounter in a Bosnian Landscape, he argued that people and landscapes may sometimes be trapped between timespaces and thus \\"schizochronotopic\\" (from the Greek œÉœáŒØŒ∂ŒµŒπŒΩ (skhizein): \\"to split\\"). He described two overarching chronotopes as \\"collective timespace themes\\", both of which relied on certain kinds of past and laid claims to the Field‚Äôs future. One was told through proximities, the other through distances between religious communities. For Had≈æiMuhamedoviƒá, schizochronotopia is a rift occurring within the same body/landscape, through which the past and the present of place have rendered each other unbidden. The chronotope has also been adopted for the analysis of classroom events and conversations, for example by Raymond Brown and Peter Renshaw in order to view \\"student participation in the classroom as a dynamic process constituted through the interaction of past experience, ongoing involvement, and yet-to- be-accomplished goals\\" (2006: 247‚Äì259). Kumpulainen, Mikkola, and Jaatinen (2013) examined the space‚Äìtime configurations of students‚Äô technology-mediated creative learning practices over a year-long school musical project in a Finnish elementary school. The findings of their study suggest that \\"blended practices appeared to break away from traditional learning practices, allowing students to navigate in different time zones, spaces, and places with diverse tools situated in their formal and informal lives\\" (2013: 53). == Notes  References == * Bakhtin, M.

It was formed out of territories the Habsburgs conquered from the Ottoman Empire and included southern parts of Slavonia and Syrmia; today the area it covered is mostly in eastern Croatia, with its easternmost parts in northern Serbia (mostly in Vojvodina region). ==Divisions== The Slavonian Military Frontier was divided between three regiments: Regiment N¬∞VII, based at Vinkovci; Regiment N¬∞VIII, based at Nova Gradi≈°ka and Regiment N¬∞IX, based at Petrovaradin. Other important towns in the area included Sremski Karlovci, Stara Pazova, Zemun, and Sremska Mitrovica. ==History== During the history, name Slavonian Military Frontier referred to different territories. It was first located in what is now Central Croatia and was known as the Vara≈ædin generalat. It was created from territories that had been part of medieval Banovina of Slavonia. Shortly after its creation in the 16th century, original Slavonian Military Frontier bordered the Ottoman Empire to the east, the Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia (part of the Habsburg Monarchy) to the west, the Croatian Military Frontier to the south-west, and the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary, also part of the Habsburg Empire, to the north. After the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699), Habsburg Monarchy expanded its territory towards east and new sections of the Military Frontier were founded along the Sava, Danube, Tisa and Mure≈ü rivers. New parts of the frontier were divided into two generalats: the first one included territory from Gradi≈°ka to river Tisa and the second one included territories along the Tisa and Mure≈ü rivers. Until the middle of the 18th century, the entire Slavonia region was under military administration. In 1745, northern parts of Slavonia were placed under civil administration and were organized into the newly formed Habsburg crownland known as the Kingdom of Slavonia. The southern parts of Slavonia that remained under military administration were organized into Slavonian Military Frontier, while former original Slavonian Military Frontier was organized as Vara≈ædin section of the Croatian Military Frontier. In the second half of the 18th century, the Slavonian Military Frontier bordered the Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia and the Croatian Military Frontier to the west, the Habsburg Kingdom of Slavonia and the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary to the north, the Banat Military Frontier to the east and the Ottoman province of Bosnia and Sanjak of Smederevo to the south. In 1783 it was placed under the unified control of the Croatian General Command () headquartered in Zagreb.Gunther Erich Rothenberg: The Military Border in Croatia, 1740‚Äì1881: a study of an imperial institution, University of Chicago Press, 1966, p. 63 The only changes of this province's borders and neighborhood before its integration into Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia in 1881 were in 1848‚Äì1849 when autonomous Serbian Vojvodina included eastern parts of Slavonian Military Frontier and between 1849 and 1860, during the existence of Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, a separate Habsburg crownland which became a north-eastern neighbor of Slavonian Military Frontier. After the creation of the Principality of Serbia in 1815, this was their southeastern neighbor. ==Population and demographics1776=== In 1776, the rural population of the Slavonian military frontier was 177,212. The number of Roman Catholic men was 43,635, while number of Orthodox men was 33,970. The number of inhabitants of cities was 11,353, and that giving a total of 188,565 inhabitants. In Brod and Gradi≈°ka regiments Catholics outnumbered the minority Orthodox, and in Petrovaradin regiment the Orthodox were more numerous. ===1820=== In 1820, population of Slavonian Military Frontier included 117,933 Catholics and 117,274 Orthodox Christians.Dr Tomislav Bogavac, Nestajanje Srba, Ni≈°, 1994, page 196. ===1870=== In 1870, Slavonian military frontier had, according to official census, 246,901 inhabitants.

Cleary, a librarian, wrote the first Henry Huggins book in 1950, in response to the boys in her library searching for books \\"about boys like us.\\" Cleary later launched a new series about one of the supporting characters, Ramona Quimby. The Ramona series ultimately surpassed the Henry Huggins series in popularity. Henry appeared only rarely in the Ramona series, as a supporting character. He was portrayed by Hutch Dano in the movie Ramona and Beezus. == Characters in Henry Huggins series == *Henry Huggins: Henry is a red-headed 11 year old, but starts out as an 8 year old. *Ribsy: Ribsy is Henry's dog; the dog was named \\"Ribsy\\" because when Henry found him, he was so thin, his ribs were showing. *Nosy: Nosy is Henry's cat. The cat was named \\"Nosy\\" because he was pecking his wet nose at Henry's dad when there were four kittens. * Beezus Quimby: Beezus, whose real name is Beatrice, is one of the children in Henry's neighborhood. In Henry's opinion, she's \\"pretty sensible for a girl\\". Beezus acquired her nickname because her younger sister, Ramona, was unable to say \\"Beatrice\\" when she was learning to talk. Everyone in the neighborhood, including Beezus and her family, adopted Ramona's pronunciation. * Ramona Quimby: Ramona is Beezus's younger sister. She wants to do everything her sister and Henry do, but because she is so young, the older children perceive her as a pest. In her preschool days, her favorite TV show was the Sheriff Bud show, a fictionalization of Howdy Doody. *Robert: Henry's best friend. Surname is unknown. *Scooter McCarthy: An older boy with a paper route; Henry is often irritated by Scooter's upperclassman attitudes. *Byron \\"Murph\\" Murphy: An older boy who is a genius, and friends with Henry. Murph moves to Henry's neighborhood in Henry and the Paper Route. *Mary Jane: A girl who lives down the street who is friends with Beezus. Surname is unknown. Henry does not really like her because she is too prissy. *The Grumbies: The Huggins' neighbors. Henry gets along with Mr. Grumbie but dislikes Mrs. Grumbie because she does not like Ribsy, which is \\"the same thing as not liking Henry\\". ==See alsoReferences== * Category:Beverly Cleary characters Category:Characters in American novels of the 20th century Category:Child characters in literature Category:Literary characters introduced in 1950 Henry Huggins Category:Fiction set in the 1950s ","title":"Henry Huggins"},{"id":"2232997","text":"Brahmachari may refer to: * Brahmachari, a male who practices brahmacharya, a type of living as per Hindu Vedic Scriptures, feminine Brahmacharini * Brahmachari, a prominent surname / title among the Bengali people of West Bengal, Assam and Bangladesh. *Dhirendra Brahmachari (1924‚Äì1994), Indian Yogi *Shuddhaanandaa Brahmachari (born 1949), motivational speaker from Kolkata, India *Brahmachari (1938 film), a 1938 Marathi film starring Meenakshi Shirodkar, Master Vinayak *Brahmachari (1968 Hindi film), a 1968 film starring Shammi Kapoor, Rajshree and Pran *Brahmachari (1968 Telugu film), a 1968 film starring Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Jayalalitha *Brahmachari (1972 film), a 1972 Malayalam language film *Brahmachari (1992 film), a 1992 Tamil language film *Brahmachari (2019 film), a 2019 Kannada language film == See also == * Mr. Brahmachari, a 2003 Indian film Category:Sanskrit words and phrases ","title":"Brahmachari"},{"id":"2233003","text":"Jazz Jackrabbit is a platform game developed by Game Titan.

Zoom The Polonaise in A‚ô≠ major, Op. 53 (, Heroic Polonaise; ) for solo piano, was written by Fr√©d√©ric Chopin in 1842. This composition is one of Chopin's most admired compositions and has long been a favorite of the romantic piano repertoire. The piece requires exceptional piano skills and great virtuosity to be interpreted at a high degree of proficiency. It is also very physically demanding, and according to his student Adolphe Gutmann, Chopin played it more gently than most performers. The polonaise was dedicated to Auguste L√©o, a German banker and friend of Chopin. == Origin of the Sobriquet 'Heroic' == George Sand, Chopin's longtime lover and companion, responded vigorously to the Revolutions of 1848 as did many intellectuals of the day. When the 1848 Revolution began in France, women had fewer rights than men and Sand believed these were necessary for progress. Around this time, Sand started her own newspaper which was published in a workers' co-operative. This allowed her to publish more political essays, expressing her strongly felt convictions. In one of these, for example, she wrote, \\"I cannot believe in any republic that starts a revolution by killing its own proletariat.\\" On hearing Chopin's Polonaise, Sand was left with a deep symbolic impression which she communicated to Chopin in their private correspondence. In one of their letters, she wrote passionately, \\"\\" (\\"The inspiration! The force! The vigour! There is no doubt that such a spirit must be present in the French Revolution. From now on this polonaise should be a symbol, a heroic symbol\\"). In spite of Chopin's reluctance to bestow descriptive names on his music, music scholars and concert pianists have nevertheless associated the grand architecture of the music with this sobriquet, \\"Heroic.\\" == Technical aspects == 1843 publication The polonaise features many difficult technical aspects, including: *Fast ascending chromatic perfect fourths *Rapid, difficult octave scaling *Trills with the weaker fingers *Quick scales *Fast arpeggios *Broken chords *Chords with wide fingering *Use of a wide range of the piano keyboard == Structure == The tempo of the piece is Alla polacca e maestoso (\\"like a polonaise and majestic\\"). The form may be viewed as intermediate between ternary (A-B-A) and rondo (A-B-A-C-A), since the first interlude is much shorter than the second (16 vs. 74 bars). The main theme is preceded by an introduction of about thirty seconds in length. The piece features a grand introduction with fast ascending chromatic notes in both hands, setting the mood of the piece; also, it shows the heroic side of Chopin's art. The first theme is a dance-like theme in the tonic key of A major. It is the familiar part of the piece and has the left hand moving in pounding octaves. The theme is repeated up an octave with short trills that fill some of the auditory gaps in the theme. The first interlude presents a series of chord progressions that lead into a recount of the traditional polonaise melody, with the polonaise rhythm employed in the left-hand accompaniment. The main theme then repeats once more. The second, main interlude (or trio section) opens with six loud arpeggio chords before switching to a very soft bass ostinato of descending octaves first in the key of E major and then in E major (written as D major). A march-like melody follows the descending octaves and this occurs twice, and then a long lyrical interlude firstly with harmonic chord progressions and frequent modulations. This ends in a descending passage before the main theme is replayed. The theme is played louder and more dramatically and ends in a coda including material derived from the main theme. A typical performance of the polonaise lasts seven minutes. The piece is written in a time marking but includes many implicit deviations from it. ==In popular culture== *The 1937 British film Moonlight Sonata opens with a concert performance of the Polonaise by Ignacy Jan Paderewski. *The 1945 film A Song to Remember, a fictionalization of Chopin's life, features the Polonaise. *The 1945 song \\"Till the End of Time\\" by Buddy Kaye and Bud Mossman is based on the Polonaise's main section. *In the first episode of The Addams Family (1964 TV series), Lurch plays the main theme on the harpsichord. *The song \\"Oliver Cromwell\\" by Monty Python is sung to the first (A‚ô≠) section of the Heroic Polonaise. *The 1971 song \\"Hyacinth House\\" by The Doors musically quotes the main theme during Ray Manzarek's organ solo. *In the 1996 movie adaptation of H.

Horace calls him king of the Dacians.John T. White, D.D. Oxon, The first (-fourth) book of the Odes of Horace with a vocabulary and some accounts of Horatian metres, London, 1875, page 70. Suetonius calls him king of the Getae. He is mentioned also by Florus, who wrote that Cotiso and his armies used to attack towards south when the Danube froze. Several scholars believe he is identical to Coson, a Dacian king whose name appears on many gold staters found in Transylvania. ==Background== After the death of Burebista, the Dacian kingdom fell apart amid turnoil and civil strife. Cotiso appears to have emerged as the dominant figure in Dacia at this time, but nothing is known about his background. The new king found himself courted by the two Roman antagonists, Octavian and Mark Antony. Cotiso was in a strong position to dictate terms of any alliance to either of the conflicting parties. Octavian/Augustus worried about the frontier and possible alliance between Mark Antony and the Dacians, and plotted an expedition around 35 BC. Despite several small conflicts, no serious campaigns were mounted. Cotiso chose to ally himself with Antony. According to Alban Dewes Winspear and Lenore Kramp Geweke he \\"proposed that the war should be fought in Macedonia rather than Epirus. Had his proposal been accepted, the subjection of Antonius might have been less easily accomplished.\\"Alban Dewes Winspear, Lenore Kramp Geweke, Augustus and the Reconstruction of Roman Government and Society, University of Wisconsin Press, 1935 p.252. ==Proposed marriage== According to Appian, Antony is responsible for the statement that Augustus sought to secure the goodwill of Cotiso, king of the Getae (Dacians) by giving him his daughter, and he himself marrying a daughter of Cotiso.Translations and reprints from the original sources of history, Univ. of Pennsylvania Press, 1898 , University of Pennsylvania. Dept. of History According to Suetonius, Cotiso refused the alliance and joined the party of Antony.Monumentum ancyranum: the deeds of Augustus, Volume 5, Issue 2, Augustus (Emperor of Rome) The Department of History of the University of Pennsylvania, 1898, page 73 Suetonius (LXIII, Life of Augustus) says Mark Antony wrote that Augustus betrothed his daughter Julia to marry Cotiso (M. Antonius scribit primum eum Antonio filio suo despondisse Iuliam, dein Cotisoni Getarum regi) to create an alliance between the two men. This failed when Cotiso betrayed Augustus. Julia ended up marrying her cousin Marcus Claudius Marcellus. According to Dio, the story about the proposed marriages is hardly credible and may have been invented by Mark Antony as propaganda to offset his own alliance with Cleopatra. ==Conflicts and death== After Augustus's victory in the civil wars, the Romans punished the Dacian ruler, who was apparently defeated in battle around 25 BC.William Miller, The Balkans: Roumania, Bulgaria, Servia, and Montenegro, Putnam, 1972, p.5 In an ode dedicated to his protector, Horace advises him not to worry about Rome's safety, because Cotiso's army has been crushed.Karina Williamson, The Works of Horace, Translated into Verse, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1996, p.402. In his account of his achievements as emperor, the Res Gestae, Augustus claimed that the Dacians had been subdued. This was not entirely true, because Dacian troops frequently crossed the Danube to ravage parts of Pannonia and Moesia.Matthew Bunson (1995): A dictionary of the Roman Empire, page 124, Oxford University Press He may have survived until the campaign of Marcus Vinicius in the Dacian area c.9 BC. Vinicius was the first Roman commander to cross the Danube and invade Dacia itself. Ioana A. Oltean argues that Cotiso probably died at some point during this campaign. He may have been killed in the war.Ioana A. Oltean, Dacia: Landscape, Colonization and Romanization, Routledge, 7 Aug 2007, p49. According to Jordanes Cotiso was succeeded by Comosicus, about whom nothing is known beyond the name. ==Cotiso and Coson== The golden coin minted with the legend ŒöŒüŒ£Œ©Œù. In the 16th century a large number of gold coins were discovered in hoards in Romania. They were patterned after Roman coins, with a depiction of a Roman consul accompanied by lictors apparently copied from coins issued by Marcus Junius Brutus. The coins bore the name \\"Coson\\" or \\"Koson\\" written in Greek lettering. Theodor Mommsen argued that Koson was probably a Dacian ally of Brutus, since the imagery was taken from Brutus's coins. Recent scholars have argued that he is very likely to be identical to Cotiso, since \\"Cotiso[n]\\" is an easy transcription error for Coson. Horace always spells the name with an \\"n\\" at the end.The Numismatist: An Illustrated Monthly Magazine for Those Interested in Coins, Medals, and Paper Money, Volume 25, 1912, p.333 Ioana A. Oltean, however, argues that Coson and Cotiso are different people, suggesting that Cotiso was Coson's successor. ==Notes== Category:Dacian kings Category:1st-century BC rulers in Europe Category:Dacian names ","title":"Cotiso"},{"id":"2233016","text":"James J. Andrews (c. 1829 - June 7, 1862) was a Kentucky civilian who worked for the Union Army during the early years of the American Civil War. He led a daring raid behind enemy lines on the Western and Atlantic Railroad, known as the Great Locomotive Chase. Andrews and seven fellow raiders were caught at the end of the chase and executed by the Confederates on the charge of spying.Russell S. Bonds. Stealing the General: The Great Locomotive Chase and the First Medal of Honor, Westholme Publishing, 2006. ==Biography== Grave of James J. Andrews and Ohio's monument to the Andrews Raiders at Chattanooga National Cemetery Andrews was born in Holiday's Cove, Virginia (now Weirton, West Virginia). He moved to Kentucky, where he found employment as a house painter and singing coach. During the Civil War, he was engaged in buying contraband merchandise (including quinine) and smuggling it between the military lines. While serving as a secret agent and scout in Nashville, Tennessee, for Major General Don Carlos Buell in the spring of 1862, he devised a plan to take eight men to steal a train in Atlanta, Georgia, and drive it north. They would disrupt Confederate communications in western Tennessee and burn the long railroad bridge over the Tennessee River at Bridgeport. The mission failed when the required engineer failed to show up at the designated meeting place. Georgia Historical Marker for Andrews in Atlanta, Georgia In April, Andrews proposed a new scheme to Major General Ormsby M. Mitchel to seize a locomotive in northern Georgia and drive it to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he would rendezvous with Mitchel's attacking Union Army. On April 12, 1862, Andrews, another civilian, William \\"Bill\\" Campbell, and 22 volunteers from three Ohio infantry regiments garbed in civilian clothes, stole a locomotive known as The General at Big Shanty, near Kennesaw, Georgia. They headed north, destroying tracks and telegraph wires along the way in an effort to discourage pursuers and render the railroad useless for supplying the Confederate troops in Tennessee. William Allen Fuller, the conductor of the stolen train pursued the train hijackers on foot, by handcar, and in a variety of other locomotives, most notably the \\"Texas\\", in which he gave chase for in reverse. After an chase, the General lost power just north of Ringgold, Georgia, and Andrews and his raiders scattered. He was captured soon afterwards and identified as the leader. He was court-martialed in Chattanooga and sentenced to hang in one week as a spy. Andrews escaped from Swims Jail on June 1, but was quickly recaptured the next day. On June 7, he was taken to Atlanta ahead of the advancing Union army by train over the same tracks that he had used during the raid. Andrews was ineptly hanged at about 5:00 that afternoon (the scaffold was so low that his feet touched the ground and he most likely died of strangulation as opposed to the internal decapitation that causes death in a proper hanging), near the present day intersection of 3rd and Juniper Streets, NE. Andrews' body was temporarily buried at the site of execution. His remains were removed to the Chattanooga National Cemetery on October 16, 1887, and a gravestone and monument to the raid was erected near the Ohio Memorial (Section H, Grave No. 12,982). ==Legacy== He was engaged to Elizabeth Layton of Flemingsburg, Kentucky at the time of his execution. After learning of her fianc√©'s death, Layton became distraught and apparently never recovered and died two years later, her family believed of a \\"broken heart\\". The first recipients of the Medal of Honor were made to military survivors of the raid. As a civilian, Andrews was ineligible for the Medal of Honor that was presented to most of the raiders. Walt Disney made a movie of Andrews' exploits in 1956 called The Great Locomotive Chase starring Fess \\"Davy Crockett\\" Parker as Andrews. Buster Keaton's 1927 feature- length comedy masterpiece The General was also loosely based on the incident. ==ReferencesSee also== *List of Andrews Raiders ==External links== * Railfanning.org: The Andrews Raid * James J.

Murtaza's own faction of his father's Pakistan People's Party‚ÄìShaheed Bhutto, remains active in politics. ==BiographyEarly life and education=== Born into the Bhutto family in Karachi on 18 September 1954, to Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Nusrat Bhutto, he received his early education at St. Mary's Academy. He was born in a Satti Rajput Bhutto family, and has three siblings: Benazir, Shahnawaz and Sanam. He later passed his 'O' levels from the Karachi Grammar School in 1971. In 1972, Murtaza went off to Harvard University where he took his bachelor's degree. For a period of time, he was the roommate of Texas gubernatorial candidate and former mayor of Houston, Bill White. In 1976, Bhutto graduated with his thesis entitled \\"Modicum of Harmony\\". His thesis dealt with the spread of nuclear weapons in general, and the implications of India's nuclear weapons on Pakistan in particular. Murtaza went on to attend Christ Church Oxford, his father's alma mater, for a three-year Master of Letters (MLitt) degree course. Bhutto submitted his master thesis, containing a vast argumentative work on Nuclear strategic studies, where he advocated for Pakistan's right to develop its nuclear deterrence programme to counter Indian nuclear programme. While in Europe studying for his PhD studies, his sister, Benazir Bhutto, had notified Murtaza Bhutto about the coup d'√©tat led by General Zia-ul-Haq. Murtaza, along with his siblings, returned to Pakistan immediately. However, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto advised his children to leave the country in the shortest time possible. Murtaza was on the verge of rushing home when he received a message from his father asking him to remain abroad where he could mobilise an international campaign for his release. Murtaza had been in Pakistan until Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's government was overthrown on 5 July 1977. Along with other family members, Murtaza had returned to Al-Murtaza, Larkana, and at the time was busy helping in the preparations for the elections scheduled for October 1977. But on 16 September 1977 when Ali Bhutto was arrested at Al- Murtaza, he asked his son to leave the country. After Ali Bhutto was sentenced, Murtaza joined hands with his brother, Shahnawaz Bhutto, to initiate a campaign to muster international support to revoke the death penalty looming over his father's head. Leaders from Syria, Libya, and the PLO were particularly supportive. Mercy appeals were sent by several heads of state to General Zia-ul-Haq; however, all these appeals were disregarded and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was executed. Murtaza and Shahnawaz both cut short their respective courses of study and decided to devote themselves to avenge their father's death. Eventually they resorted to taking up arms, their main target being Zia-ul-Haq. This marked the beginning of a new and more controversial era in Murtaza's life. ==Al-Zulfiqar== Like his elder sister, Benazir, Murtaza Bhutto was a novice to active politics until 1978 when his father, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, was sentenced to death by the Lahore High Court. In the span of 15 years, however, Murtaza managed to gain considerable notoriety for a brand of politics that has moved in a direction that was diametrically opposed to Benazir's. Al-Zulfiqar was a leftist insurgency and militant organisation of Pakistan. It was formed in the late seventies by the sons of former Pakistani Prime Minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was also the Chairman of Pakistan's biggest political party, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). Al-Zulfiqar was formed to avenge the execution of Ali Bhutto by the right-wing military regime of General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1976. Zia had deposed the populist Bhutto regime in a military coup in July 1977. Bhutto was hanged by the Zia regime after a closed military trial. Ali Bhutto's two sons, Murtaza and Shahnawaz went into exile in Afghanistan which was at that time controlled by communist revolutionary government of Babrak Karmal. There the two sons formed Al- Zulfiqar along with hundreds of Pakistan Peoples Party militants who had escaped Zia's persecution. The Al-Zulfiqar Organization (AZO) was born at this point, and disgruntled elements among the younger members of the PPP, disappointed in the party's leadership, flocked to Murtaza's side. The AZO, however, went on to earn the title of terrorist organisation due to its various terrorist activities throughout the country, a label which dogged Murtaza till he died. For his part, Murtaza always denied the charge that he espoused the politics of terrorism. ==1981 PIA hijacked== Al-Zulfiqar hijacked a Pakistan International Airlines flight after and diverted it to Kabul in March 1981. From Kabul the journey went on to Damascus, Syria. The hijacking went on for thirteen days, during which Murtaza shot Major Tariq Rahim for being an Army officer. Rahim was executed following Murtaza's conferring with Afghan Intelligence (KHAD) chief Mohammad Najibullah. The Zia government had to accept the demands of the hijackers, releasing dozens of prisoners languishing in Pakistani jails and flying them to Tripoli. === Prosecution of the hijack === In 2003 the case against Murtaza Bhutto and his brother was concluded quietly absolving them from blame relating to the PIA Hijacking, according to Fatima Bhutto's Book ‚Äì Songs of Blood and Sword. In the book, she indicates that the actual leader of the hijacking was Salamullah Tipu. Tipu had attempted to join the AZO in Kabul, but was rejected as the AZO supposedly never accepted those that came to them (in what was to be a futile effort to prevent infiltration). Murtaza Bhutto was supposedly only to hear about the hijacking when Tipu called him in Afghanistan from the hijacked aircraft. Contrary to this, Raja Anwar in his book The Terrorist Prince paints a negative picture of Murtaza Bhutto. He writes that the idea to hijack a plane came from Murtaza Bhutto himself, who was 'obsessed' about the tactic after the Palestinians resorted to it in the seventies and eighties. Anwar tells of an excited Murtaza who, while he had early advised Tipu on taking the aircraft to Damascus or Tripoli went into pragmatic overdrive once the plane landed in Kabul due to a shortage of fuel. Anwar, after detailed conversations with Salamullah Tipu, which he recounts in his book tells of the role Najibullah played along with Murtaza in directing the hijack from the Kabul airport control tower. Raja says that while the hijackers had arrived into Kabul with only revolvers, they were soon furnished with semi-automatic weapons after Murtaza's successive meetings with Tipu under the 'belly of the PIA aircraft'. The most compelling account from 'The Terrorist Prince' tell of the treatment meted out to Major Tariq Rahim, who was ADC to Murtaza's father Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. Raja Anwar recounts the successive pleas (in the form of notes written on torn pieces of newspaper) Tariq Rahim made to Murtaza and Shahnawaz (Murtaza's younger brother) on account of his association with Zulfiqar Bhutto. These pleas according to one of the hijackers were delivered to Murtaza Bhutto, who not only discarded them, but instead instructed Salamullah Tipu to execute Tariq Rahim. The books tells of countless stories of many activists who became fodder for Murtaza Bhutto in his quest to seek revenge for his father's judicial murder at the hands of General Zia-ul-Haq. ==Rife with Asif Ali Zardari== After returning to Pakistan from exile , Bhutto offered his sister, Benazir Bhutto, the chance to revive the manifesto of PPP which his father championed. However, he was not happy with the ways of Benazir's husband Asif Ali Zardari and wanted him removed from influence in the PPP. When Benazir decided to side with her husband, Murtaza became a strong critic of the PPP government and the ongoing corruption. It is widely believed in Pakistan that this incident drove Zardari to rage and he used police machinery to assassinate Murtaza Bhutto. Benazir became highly unpopular after this incident and her limo was stoned by PPP workers when she tried to visit Murtaza's funeral ceremonies. After Benazir's government was dismissed in 1996, Zardari was detained for having a part in Murtaza's assassination. However, no charges were ever proven due to lack of evidence. ==Personal life== Bhutto fell in love with a Dari girl named, Fauzia Fasihuddin Bhutto, in Afghanistan. He married Fauzaia in 1980, and his brother Shahnawaz married her sister Rehana Fasihuddin. They had a daughter Fatima Bhutto. However, he marriage ended on divorce and Bhutto along with his daughter moved to Syria, where he married the Lebanese dancer Ghinwa Bhutto in 1989. Bhutto, with his wife Ghinwa and daughter Fatima, later moved to Karachi in 1990, where the couple's son Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Jr was born. ==Death== Just before his death, Bhutto, 42, had verbally attacked the government. \\"There would be trouble if the Police tries to arrest me without a warrant,\\" he had declared. Bhutto was sought by the police on the charge of inciting attacks on two CIA centres the previous Tuesday where it was thought that his party activist Ali Sunara was detained. On Thursday, 20 September 1996 at 6:35 p.m., Bhutto, along with six other party activists, was killed in an encounter with police near his residence. Among the dead was Aashiq Jatoi, the acting provincial chief of the Pakistan Peoples Party (Shaheed Bhutto Group). Jatoi was a brother in-law of Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, the former Prime Minister of Pakistan. The injured list included six activists of Murtaza Bhutto's party and three policemen, including Superintendent of Police of Saddar area of Karachi and two other station house officers (SHOs). ===Official explanation=== A Sindh government handout issued late the night of Bhutto's death said that Bhutto's vehicle was allowed to proceed to his residence by SHO Clifton after it was stopped. Bhutto's gunmen, sitting on the land cruiser vehicle, resorted to indiscriminate firing injuring Area Superintendent of Police (ASP) Saddar, SHO Clifton and a person in a nearby taxi. Other gunmen sitting in Bhutto's vehicle also started firing straight at the police. The police, under the command of ASP Drakshan and ASP Saddar, returned fire in self-defence, and after an encounter of 20 to 25 minutes, took control of the situation. The police claimed that they reached the Bhutto's residence at number 70 Clifton, at 8:30 p.m., to arrest him. The policemen alleged that security guards, belonging to Bhutto and stationed at his house, opened fire, injuring several policemen. Return fire by the police party caused fatal injuries to Bhutto and his supporters. Police said Bhutto's followers, who were in three cars returning from a party, fired first when asked to stop. Police returned fire, killing six people, all members of Murtaza Bhutto's faction. This was confirmed by the Deputy Inspector General of police Shoaib Suddle. Suddle further said that the police had insisted on checking the vehicles because of tightened security after two bomb blasts in Karachi on Wednesday, 18 September 1996, in which one person was killed and at least four others were wounded. The party activists who were wounded were identified as Dr. Mazhar Memon, Siraj Hyder, Ismail, Ayaz, Asghar and Bachhal. The policemen who were shot were ASP Saddar Shahid Hayat, SHO Clifton Haq Nawaz Sayyal, and SHO Napier Junaid. Two injured policemen remained unidentified. The injured were moved to the Aga Khan Hospital and Civil Hospital. Those who were killed with Bhutto were identified as Ashiq Jatoi, Rehman Brohi, Sajjad Hyder, Abdul Sattar Rajpur, Yar Mohammed Baloch and Wajahat Jokhio. The bodies reached JPMC Hospital at about 3:30 a.m. The police arrested 12 supporters of Bhutto and seized about a dozen AK-47 rifles from their possession. Some policemen who had stopped Bhutto's vehicle later claimed that they did not know whose car they had stopped. They said that they would not have opened fire on the motorcade had they known that it was Bhutto's. Others said that they had fired in panic and self-defence. Senior police officials were tight-lipped about the tragedy. Sources said that after the incident the Rangers again cordoned off the area and searched the house. ===Pakistan People's Party of Shaheed Bhutto version=== Dr. Mazhar Memon, Senior Vice-President of the party's Hyderabad Division, blamed the police for opening fire on Bhutto without any provocation. \\"We were returning from a public meeting at Surjani Town, District West of Karachi, when the police and Rangers stopped near the 70 Clifton,\\" Dr. Memon stated at the JPMC Casualty Department. He said that Bhutto had exited the car to talk with the official. The policemen suddenly opened fire on Bhutto, seriously injuring him. Dr Memon said, \\"I also came out of the vehicle to help my injured leader who was on the ground and I received a bullet in my leg.\\" Dr Memon added that when Bhutto's guards saw him on the ground in a pool of blood, they rushed out and opened fire on the police. The policemen ignored Bhutto and continued firing. Memon added that when the firing died down, the Rangers who were on the spot jumped from their vehicles. Some eyewitnesses said that Bhutto, after getting out of his car, challenged the policemen to shoot him. A man was seen struggling for his life after being hit by police fire in front of the DIG police residence. The firing continued for half an hour, causing great panic in the area. Soon after the incident, when newsmen rushed to the hospital, they were beaten by highly emotionally charged policemen. The personnel of the law enforcement agencies cocked their guns and confiscated the cameras of photographers. One of the police officers ordered his force to open fire at journalists should they ignore his orders and advance. ==Aftermath== Sources said that when Murtaza Bhutto arrived at the Mideast hospital in an official car, blood was oozing from his mouth. He tried to take off the oxygen mask but the doctors kept replacing it. Bhutto then collapsed and lost consciousness. At this time Bhutto's wife Ghinva and daughter Fatimah, both of them crying, reached the hospital. They were ordered out of the ICU, where the only official present was the Deputy Commissioner South, Arif Elahi. Soon the specialist doctors from Jinnah Hospital reached the Mideast Hospital. No anaesthetist was available at the hospital, which normally does not treat medico-legal cases. Murtaza was shot in his collarbone, chest, leg and abdomen. His body refused to accept a blood transfusion while he was being operated upon. Doctors revived his heart once when it stopped but failed to do so the second time. Murtaza Bhutto died at 11:45 p.m. but his death was not announced by the hospital authorities until 12:25 a.m. On Saturday, the body was taken for burial by helicopter to Larkana, Sindh. The pilot of one of the helicopters which carried the body had difficulty in lifting the chopper as a number of supporters of Bhutto from Lyari, Karachi clung to the skids in a bid to board the aircraft. While the helicopter managed to lift off, many of the visibly moved supporters fell down. One, however, clung to the helicopter. The helicopter flew up to sea side and then returned and landed at Bagh Ibn-e-Qasim where the youth clinging to the helicopter's skid fell down and the chopper flew away. Bhutto was laid to rest at the Bhutto family mausoleum in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh near Larkana, Sindh, Pakistan. ==Police trial== On 3 December 2009, a sessions court in Karachi acquitted of murder twenty policemen in the Murtaza Bhutto case pertaining to an armed attack on a police team in which two officials were wounded and a taxi driver was also killed. The same court also pardoned six workers of the Pakistan People's Party Shaheed Bhutto in the same case. During the 13 years that the trial dragged on, a number of judges were appointed to hear the murder case. The change of judges is one of the many reasons behind the delay in disposal of the present case. Other reasons include a lack of interest of the prosecution witnesses and long adjournments sought by the counsel for President Asif Ali. The acquitted included Mazhar Memon, Asghar Ali, Asif Ali Jatoi, Mehmood Bhallai, Ghulam Mustafa Chandio and Akhter Ali Mirani. The police personnel acquitted include Shoaib Suddle, Wajid Durrani, Masood Sharif, Rai Tahir and others who were prosecution witnesses in this case. ==See also== *Pakistan Peoples Party *Pakistan Peoples Party (Shaheed Bhutto) ==References *Interview with FatimaBhutto Radio France Internationale in English Category:1954 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Assassinated Pakistani politicians Murtaza Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Karachi Grammar School alumni Category:Sindhi people Category:Pakistani people of Iranian descent Category:Pakistani democracy activists Category:People murdered in Pakistan Category:Pakistan Peoples Party politicians Category:Al-Zulfiqar Category:Pakistani expatriates in Syria Category:Pakistani exiles Category:Pakistani expatriates in Afghanistan Category:Hijackers Category:Pakistani dissidents Category:People from Clifton, Karachi Category:Pakistani socialists Category:People of the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War Category:Children of national leaders Category:Pakistani people of Kurdish descent Category:Children of Prime Ministers of Pakistan Category:Children of Presidents of Pakistan Category:People shot dead by law enforcement officers in Pakistan Category:Deaths by firearm in Sindh ","title":"Murtaza Bhutto"},{"id":"2233051","text":"DerMarr Miles Johnson (born May 5, 1980) is an American professional basketball player who played eight seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

She served as a commissioned ship for 22 years and 11 months. She was laid down as AKA-116 on 3 April 1968 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., Newport News, Virginia; redesignated LKA-116 on 1 January 1969; and launched on 4 January 1969. She was sponsored by Leonor K. Sullivan, Representative from the 3d District of Missouri and commissioned on 22 November 1969 at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, CAPT John W. Klinefelter in command. USS St. Louis (LKA-116) was decommissioned on 2 November 1992 in Sasebo, Japan. From Sasebo the ship was towed to Pearl Harbor, HI, where she was kept in mothballs. ==Initial trials and training== Following commissioning, St. Louis was outfitted at Norfolk; and, on 3 February 1970, commenced trials. On 6 February, she was ready for sea and sailed for Long Beach, California, her home port. While en route, she conducted underway training for her crew, visited Fort Lauderdale, Florida, transited the Panama Canal and arrived at Long Beach on 28 February ready for two months of intensive training in battle organization and amphibious operations. St. Louis spent May and June in post-shakedown availability and the greater part of July in provisioning preparatory to her first deployment with the fleet. Late in July, she conducted her first dependents' cruise to familiarize the families of her crew members with her operations and capabilities. She got underway on 1 August with units of Amphibious Squadron 11 for Pearl Harbor. ==Vietnam== St. Louis, with the squadron, reached Pearl Harbor on 6 August, refueled, and sailed on the 8th for South Vietnam. On 16 August, she was detached to proceed to Subic Bay and finally rejoined her squadron at Da Nang on 21 August. After offloading Marines and their equipment, she then proceeded to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, returned to Long Beach to transport a World War II midget Japanese submarine to the submarine base at Pearl Harbor; and moored to deep water pier in Da Nang Harbor on 11 October. After completion of a large redeployment operation involving over 2,000 Marines and 22,000 tons of equipment in Qu·∫£ng Nam Province, St. Louis visited Hong Kong and then moved to Subic Bay in the Philippines to participate in large scale amphibious landing exercises during November and December. St. Louis completed the amphibious exercise in early January, spent 15 days in upkeep in Subic Bay, then headed north again for two months of shuttling men and cargo between Vietnam, Okinawa, and Japan. She departed from Yokosuka on 20 March 1971 and entered Long Beach on the 31st. After a month and a half stand down period in Long Beach and three more weeks of local operations and upkeep there, she returned to Vietnam, arriving in Da Nang on 24 June. She visited Hong Kong, 28 June to 3 July, then returned to Long Beach on 19 July. St. Louis remained on the west coast for the remainder of 1971 and for the first three months of 1972. During this period, she was engaged in refresher training, amphibious exercises, and upkeep. ==1970s-1980s== On 31 March 1972 St. Louis headed out of Long Beach Naval Shipyard back to the picket line off the coast of South Vietnam, participating in the defense of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province during the Easter Offensive on 24 May 1972. The St. Louis offloaded South Vietnamese Marines and US Navy SEAL squads during this assault, earning a campaign star, and later, in the 1990s, the Combat Action Ribbon. After seven months of transporting men and cargo between various bases in the western Pacific, she returned to Long Beach on Veterans Day 1972. She spent the rest of 1972 and all of 1973 on the west coast. She visited Acapulco, Mexico, in February, participated in DSRV operations in May and visited Portland, Oregon, in June for the annual Rose Festival. She finished out 1973 with availability periods, refresher training, and amphibious exercises. In mid-January 1974, St. Louis stood out of Long Beach to return to the western Pacific. As of May 1974, she was in port at Subic Bay, Philippines. 1980-1981 she sailed a West Pac Cruise leaving San Diego, to pick up Marines from MSSG-31. She sailed to several countries Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Africa, Freemantle, Australia, Okinawa, South Korea. She had a beautiful stop at Diego Garcia & was in the Persian Gulf when the hostages of our American Embassy in Tehran were released. A Battle E was awarded to the ship, and the Navy Expeditionary Medal was awarded to Sailors, and the Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal was awarded to Marines. Captain D.R. \\"The Snake\\" Morris, (later RADM) was the Commanding Officer of the ship, and Major Bailey was the Commanding Officer of the embarked Marines. I was a member of the crew (USMC). The St. Louis returned to her home port of 32nd Street Naval Station San Diego, California. In 1983 she changed home port to Sasebo, Japan where she performed troop transfers between Okinawa and Korea and amphibious ready group deployments until she was decommissioned in 1992. ==Early 1990s and fate== St. Louis would spend most of 1990 in repair and upkeep period. In May 1991, the St. Louis would participate in Operation Sea Angel in Chittagong Bangladesh after a powerful tropical cyclone struck the Chittagong district of southeastern Bangladesh killing at least 138,000 people and leaving as many as 10 million homeless. On 13 May 1991, Seventh Fleet ordered the USS St. Louis under the command of Capt. John W. Peterson, to proceed from Subic Bay in the Philippines to Naha, Okinawa Japan. At Naha, the St. Louis would load 28 reverse osmosis water purification units ( ROWPUs) each weighing more than 5 tons for use in the relief effort. The amphibious cargo ship St. Louis departed Okinawa on 19 May and arrived 10 days later on 29 May, off the coast of Chittagong, Bangladesh. After this, the St. Louis was released from their duties of a successful operation. Early on the 8th the St. Louis weighed anchor and steamed for Phuket, Thailand, where her crew was granted their first liberty in weeks. The St. Louis arrived in Phuket, Thailand on 11 June and would depart on 15 June. As the St. Louis left Phuket her tasking again was changed. On orders from the Seventh Fleet, the St. Louis was to make the best possible speed to Subic Bay in the Philippines. There the St. Louis would provide humanitarian assistance to the naval base and nearby Cubi Point Naval Air Station during Operation Fiery Vigil after the volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo, followed by several days of torrential rains and severe earthquakes. St. Louis was involved in exercises off Pohang, Korea and Okinawa, Japan in 1991 and 1992. In May 1992, the St. Louis would make her final voyage to liberty ports Penang, Malaysia, Singapore, the St. Louis crossed the equator on 19 May 1992 at latitude 00.00 and longitude 106.01 East after departing Singapore. The St. Louis would make its way to Pattaya, Thailand and finally Hong Kong before departing one last time for Sasebo, Japan where the St. Louis was stationed. St. Louis was decommissioned and put in reserve on 2 November 1992. As of 30 July 2001 she was berthed at the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility, Middle Loch, in Pearl Harbor. St. Louis was finally sunk as a target for Valiant Shield 2018 on 21 September 2018. ==Awards== St. Louis earned two battle stars for service in the Vietnam War. St. Louis earned two Battle E Awards during pacific theatre operations in 1981 and 1982. ==References *Naval Historical Center: USS St. Louis VI *NavSource Online: AKA / LKA-116 St. Louis * * fas.org: LKA-113 Charleston class *USS St. Louis Commemorative Site *Military.com: USS St. Louis *51 Years of AKAs *(http://www.marines.mil/Portals/59/Publications/ANGELS%20FROM%20THE%20SEA%20-%20RELIEF%20OPERATIONS%20IN%20BANGLADESH%201991%20PCN%2019000316400_2.pdf referring to: Angels from the sea:Relief Operations in Bangladesh, 1991 *(http://www.hullnumber.com/AKA-116 Category:Charleston-class amphibious cargo ships Category:Cold War amphibious warfare vessels of the United States Category:Vietnam War amphibious warfare vessels of the United States Category:Ships built in Newport News, Virginia Category:1969 ships Category:Ships sunk as targets ","title":"USS St. Louis (LKA-116)"},{"id":"2233071","text":"William Aitcheson Haswell (5 August 1854 ‚Äì 24 January 1925) was a Scottish- Australian zoologist specialising in crustaceans, winner of the 1915 Clarke Medal. __NOTOC__ ==Early life== Haswell was born at Gayfield House, Edinburgh, son of James Haswell, banker, and his wife Margaret, n√©e Cranston. Haswell studied at the Edinburgh Institution and the University of Edinburgh (M.A., 1877; BSc, 1878; D.Sc., 1887) where he won seven medals, and at the conclusion of his course gained the Bell-Baxter scholarship as the most distinguished natural science student of his year. Amongst his teachers were Thomas Henry Huxley, Archibald Geikie and Charles Wyville Thomson. He qualified for the MA and BSc degrees in 1878, and immediately afterwards, for reasons of health, went on a voyage to Australia. ==Career== Haswell arrived in Sydney in late 1878 and soon began work in a small marine zoological laboratory at Watson's Bay. There he researched the collections from the Chevert expedition to New Guinea, and on the marine fauna of Port Jackson and the adjacent coast. Haswell was elected a member of the Linnean Society of New South Wales in April 1879, when he had already contributed five papers to the Proceedings. He accepted a post as curator at the Queensland Museum in Brisbane, but moved back to Sydney after one year in the position. In 1881 he collected specimens along the tropical coast of Queensland as a guest on HMS Alert. In 1881 Sir William Macleay arranged for him to give a course of public lectures on zoology. At the University of Sydney, he was appointed professor of biology in 1889. Haswell was acting-curator of the Australian museum for part of 1882, and compiled a Catalogue of the Australian Stalk- and Sessile-eyed Crustacea which was published in that year. In the same year he was appointed demonstrator, and later, lecturer, in the subjects of zoology, comparative anatomy, and histology at the university of Sydney. He was much interested in the fauna of the New South Wales coast, and especially in the Crustacea, Annelida and Bryozoa, but also did other work covering a wide field. When the Challis professorship of biology was founded in 1889, Haswell was given the position and held it until its division in 1913. In 1893 he published in the Macleay Memorial Volume \\"A Monograph of the Temnocephaleae\\", a group which retained his interest for the remainder of his life. He collaborated with Charles Hedley and Sir Joseph Verco in investigating the continental shelf. In January 1898 appeared Haswell's best known publication A Text Book of Zoology (London) written in conjunction with Thomas Jeffery Parker of the University of Otago, New Zealand. Despite being over 1400 pages, the book was described by the authors as being \\"strictly adapted to the needs of the beginner\\". On account of Parker's death the second edition of this standard textbook, which appeared in 1910, was prepared by Haswell, as was also the edition which came out in January 1922. A fourth edition was released in 1928 and it remained a standard in Australian zoology courses for decades. He also published a Manual of Zoology in 1899 which was reprinted in 1908. In 1913 a chair of botany was created at the university of Sydney and Haswell became professor of zoology. ==Late life and legacy== Haswell resigned his office at the end of 1917 and was appointed professor emeritus. He continued doing research work until shortly before his death from heart disease at Sydney on 24 January 1925. In 1894 Haswell had married Josephine Gordon, daughter of W. G. Rich, who survived him with a daughter. Haswell was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, London, in 1897. In 1915 the Royal Society of New South Wales awarded him the Clarke Medal. In addition to the works already mentioned Haswell contributed a large number of papers to scientific journals. No fewer than 74 of these were published in the Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. He was a member of the council of this society from 1881 until his death, and was its president for the years 1891‚Äì2 and 1892‚Äì3. He was also a trustee of the Australian museum for 33 years. Haswell was shy and unassuming, with a quiet sense of humour and much appreciation of a good story. On vacation he was fond of fly-fishing and golf, but generally he was an unceasing worker, collecting himself the materials for his researches, and making his own drawings. The Text-Book of Zoology in which he had so large a share was an excellent piece of work, clearly written and concise, a remarkable piece of scholarship which in its own way could hardly have been excelled. Many generations of students in Great Britain, America and Australia, laid the foundations of their knowledge of zoology on this book. Haswell was himself a good and sound teacher, and at the time of his death, in four out of the six universities of Australia, the chair of zoology or biology was held by one of his former students. == Bibliography == Among the written publications of William Aitcheson Haswell are: * Online copy of Haswell 1882 in Internet Archive * ( in 2 volumes).Copies of Parker and Haswell 1897, vol1 and vol2 in Internet Archive. 3rd ed., 1921: in BHL. 7th ed. 1972, . * Online copy of Parker and Haswell 1899 in IA.Review of Parker & Haswell 1899 in The Zoologist, alt=wikisource logo 4th series, vol 4, issue 705 (March, 1900), 149/150. == References  Sources == *Patricia Morison, 'Haswell, William Aitcheson (1854‚Äì1925)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 9, MUP, 1983, pp 226‚Äì227.

It was one of three spacecraft, along with the mother/daughter pair of ISEE-1 and ISEE-2, built for the International Sun-Earth Explorer (ISEE) program, a joint effort by NASA and ESRO/ESA to study the interaction between the Earth's magnetic field and the solar wind. ISEE-3 was the first spacecraft to be placed in a halo orbit at the Earth-Sun Lagrangian point. Renamed ICE, it became the first spacecraft to visit a comet, passing through the plasma tail of comet Giacobini-Zinner within about of the nucleus on September 11, 1985. NASA suspended routine contact with ISEE-3 in 1997, and made brief status checks in 1999 and 2008. On May 29, 2014, two-way communication with the spacecraft was reestablished by the ISEE-3 Reboot Project, an unofficial group with support from the Skycorp company. On July 2, 2014, they fired the thrusters for the first time since 1987. However, later firings of the thrusters failed, apparently due to a lack of nitrogen pressurant in the fuel tanks. The project team initiated an alternative plan to use the spacecraft to \\"collect scientific data and send it back to Earth\\", but on September 16, 2014, contact with the probe was lost. ==Original mission: International Sun/Earth Explorer 3 (ISEE-3)== International Sun/Earth Explorer's orbits ICE mission Top-down view of the orbit of ICE relative to the inner Solar System in and after 2009. ISEE-3 carries no cameras; instead, its instruments measure energetic particles, waves, plasmas, and fields. ISEE-3 originally operated in a halo orbit about the Sun-Earth Lagrangian point, 235 Earth radii above the surface (about 1.5 million km, or 924,000 miles). It was the first artificial object placed at a so-called \\"libration point\\", entering orbit there on November 20, 1978, proving that such a suspension between gravitational fields was possible. It rotates at 19.76 rpm about an axis perpendicular to the ecliptic, to keep it oriented for its experiments, to generate solar power and to communicate with Earth. The purposes of the mission were: * to investigate solar-terrestrial relationships at the outermost boundaries of the Earth's magnetosphere; * to examine in detail the structure of the solar wind near the Earth and the shock wave that forms the interface between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere; * to investigate motions of and mechanisms operating in the plasma sheets; and, * to continue the investigation of cosmic rays and solar flare emissions in the interplanetary region near 1 AU. ==Second mission: International Cometary Explorer== After completing its original mission, ISEE-3 was re-tasked to study the interaction between the solar wind and a cometary atmosphere. On June 10, 1982, the spacecraft performed a maneuver which removed it from its halo orbit around the point and placed it in a transfer orbit. This involved a series of passages between Earth and the Sun- Earth Lagrangian point, through the Earth's magnetotail. Fifteen propulsive maneuvers and five lunar gravity assists resulted in the spacecraft being ejected from the Earth-Moon system and into a heliocentric orbit. Its last and closest pass over the Moon, on December 22, 1983, was only above the lunar surface; following this pass, the spacecraft was re-designated as the International Cometary Explorer (ICE). ===Giacobini-Zinner encounter=== Its new orbit put it ahead of the Earth on a trajectory to intercept comet Giacobini-Zinner. On September 11, 1985, the craft passed through the comet's plasma tail. ICE did a flyby of the comet nucleus at a distance of of the nucleus on September 11, 1985. ===Halley encounter=== ICE transited between the Sun and Comet Halley in late March 1986, when other spacecraft were near the comet on their early-March comet rendezvous missions. (This \\"Halley Armada\\" included Giotto, Vega 1 and 2, Suisei and Sakigake.) ICE flew through the tail; its minimum distance to the comet nucleus was . For comparison, Earth's minimum distance to Comet Halley in 1910 was . ===Heliospheric mission=== An update to the ICE mission was approved by NASA in 1991. It defines a heliospheric mission for ICE consisting of investigations of coronal mass ejections in coordination with ground-based observations, continued cosmic ray studies, and the Ulysses probe. By May 1995, ICE was being operated under a low duty cycle, with some data-analysis support from the Ulysses project. ===End of mission=== On May 5, 1997, NASA ended the ICE mission, leaving only a carrier signal operating. The ISEE-3/ICE downlink bit rate was nominally 2048 bits per second during the early part of the mission, and 1024 bit/s during the Giacobini-Zinner comet encounter. The bit rate then successively dropped to 512 bit/s (on December 9, 1985), 256 bit/s (on January 5, 1987), 128 bit/s (on January 24, 1989) and finally to 64 bit/s (on December 27, 1991). Though still in space, NASA donated the craft to the Smithsonian Museum. By January 1990, ICE was in a 355-day heliocentric orbit with an aphelion of 1.03 AU, a perihelion of 0.93 AU and an inclination of 0.1 degree. ===Further contact=== In 1999, NASA made brief contact with ICE to verify its carrier signal. On September 18, 2008, NASA, with the help of KinetX, located ICE using the NASA Deep Space Network after discovering that it had not been powered off after the 1999 contact. A status check revealed that 12 of its 13 experiments were still functioning, and it still had enough propellant for of Œîv. It was determined to be possible to reactivate the spacecraft in 2014, when it again made a close approach to Earth, and scientists discussed reusing the probe to observe more comets in 2017 or 2018. ==Reboot effort== Sometime after NASA's interest in the ICE waned, others realized that the spacecraft might be steered to pass close to another comet. A team of engineers, programmers, and scientists began to study the feasibility and challenges involved. In April 2014, its members formally announced their intentions to \\"recapture\\" the spacecraft for use, calling the effort the ISEE-3 Reboot Project. A team webpage said, \\"We intend to contact the ISEE-3 (International Sun-Earth Explorer) spacecraft, command it to fire its engine and enter an orbit near Earth, and then resume its original mission... If we are successful we intend to facilitate the sharing and interpretation of all of the new data ISEE-3 sends back via crowd sourcing.\\" On May 15, the project reached its crowdfunding goal of US$125,000 on RocketHub, which was expected to cover the costs of writing the software to communicate with the probe, searching through the NASA archives for the information needed to control the spacecraft, and buying time on the dish antennas. The project then set a \\"stretch goal\\" of $150,000, which it also met with a final total of $159,502 raised. The project members were working on deadline: if they got the spacecraft to change its orbit by late May or early June 2014, or in early July by using more fuel, it could use the Moon's gravity to get back into a useful halo orbit. ===Replacing lost hardware=== Earlier in 2014, officials with the Goddard Space Flight Center said the Deep Space Network equipment necessary to transmit signals to the spacecraft had been decommissioned in 1999, and was too expensive to replace. However, project members were able to find documentation for the original equipment and were able to simulate the complex modulator/demodulator electronics using modern software-defined radio (SDR) techniques and open-source programs from the GNU Radio project. They obtained the needed hardware, an off-the-shelf SDR transceiver and power amplifier, and installed it on the 305-meter Arecibo dish antenna on May 19, 2014. Once they gained control of the spacecraft, the capture team planned to shift the primary ground station to the 21-meter dish located at Kentucky's Morehead State University Space Science Center. The 20-meter dish antenna in Bochum Observatory, Germany, would be a support station. Although NASA was not funding the project, it made advisors available and gave approval to try to establish contact. On May 21, 2014, NASA announced that it had signed a Non- Reimbursable Space Act Agreement with the ISEE-3 Reboot Project. \\"This is the first time NASA has worked such an agreement for use of a spacecraft the agency is no longer using or ever planned to use again,\\" officials said. ===Contact reestablished=== On May 29, 2014, the reboot team successfully commanded the probe to switch into Engineering Mode to begin to broadcast telemetry. On June 26, project members using the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex DSS-24 antenna achieved synchronous communication and obtained the four ranging points needed to refine the spacecraft's orbital parameters. The project team received approval from NASA to continue operations through at least July 16, and made plans to attempt the orbital maneuver in early July. On July 2, the reboot project fired the thrusters for the first time since 1987. They spun up the spacecraft to its nominal roll rate, in preparation for the upcoming trajectory correction maneuver in mid- July. On July 8, a longer sequence of thrusters firings failed, apparently due to loss of the nitrogen gas needed to pressurize the fuel tanks. On July 24, the ISEE-3 Reboot Team announced that all attempts to change orbit using the ISEE-3 propulsion system had failed. Instead, the team said, the ISEE-3 Interplanetary Citizen Science Mission would gather data as the spacecraft flies by the Moon on August 10 and enters a heliocentric orbit similar to Earth's. The team began shutting down propulsion components to maximize the electrical power available for the science experiments. On July 30, the team announced that it still planned to acquire data from as much of ISEE-3's 300-day orbit as possible. With five of the 13 instruments on the spacecraft still working, the science possibilities included listening for gamma-ray bursts, where observations from additional locations in the Solar System can be valuable. The team was also recruiting additional receiving sites around the globe to improve diurnal coverage, in order to upload additional commands while the spacecraft is close to Earth and later to receive data. On August 10 at 18:16 UTC, the spacecraft passed about from the surface of the Moon. It will continue in its heliocentric orbit, and will return to the vicinity of Earth in 2031. ===Contact lost=== On September 25, 2014, the Reboot team announced that contact with the probe was lost on September 16. It is unknown whether contact can be reestablished because the probe's exact orbit is uncertain. The spacecraft's post-lunar flyby orbit takes it further from the Sun, causing electrical power available from its solar arrays to drop, and its battery failed in 1981. Reduced power could have caused the craft to enter a safe mode, from which it may be impossible to awaken without the precise orbital location information needed to point transmissions at the craft. ==Spacecraft design== The ISEE-3 (later ICE), undergoing testing and evaluation. The ICE spacecraft is a barrel-like cylindrical shape covered by solar panels. Four long antennas protrude equidistant around the circumference of the spacecraft, spanning . It has a dry mass of and can generate nominal power of 173 watts. ===Payload=== ICE carries 13 scientific instruments to measure plasmas, energetic particles, waves, and fields. , five were known to be functional. It does not carry a camera or imaging system. Its detectors measure high energy particles such as X- and gamma-rays, solar wind, plasma and cosmic particles. A data handling system gathers the scientific and engineering data from all systems in the spacecraft and formats them into a serial stream for transmission. The transmitter output power is five watts. ===Scientific payload and experiments=== * Solar Wind Plasma Experiment, failed after February 26, 1980 * Vector Helium Magnetometer * Low Energy Cosmic Ray Experiment, designed to measure solar, interplanetary, and magnetospheric energetic ions * Medium Energy Cosmic Ray Experiment, 1-500 MeV/n, Z = 1-28; Electrons: 2-10 MeV * High Energy Cosmic Ray Experiment, H to Ni, 20-500 MeV/n *Plasma Wave Instrument * Low Energy Proton Experiment, also known as the Energetic Particle Anisotropy Spectrometer (EPAS), designed to study low-energy solar proton acceleration and propagation processes in interplanetary space * Cosmic Ray Electrons and Nuclei * X-Rays and Electrons Instrument, to provide continuous coverage of solar-flare X rays and transient cosmic gamma-ray bursts * Radio Mapping Experiment, 30 kHz - 2 MHz, to map the trajectories of type III solar bursts * Plasma Composition Experiment * Heavy Isotope Spectrometer Telescope * Ground Based Solar Studies Experiment ==Publications== * * * ==References * ISEE-3/ICE profile by NASA HEASARC * ISEE-3/ICE profile by NASA Solar System Exploration * ISEE-3 Reboot Project homepage at SpaceCollege.com * A Spacecraft for All, an interactive site created in cooperation with Google to support the ISEE-3 Reboot Project Category:1978 in spaceflight Category:Derelict space probes Category:Artificial satellites orbiting the Sun Category:Missions to comets Category:NASA space probes Category:Spacecraft launched in 1978 Category:Explorers Program Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Spacecraft using halo orbits ","title":"International Cometary Explorer"},{"id":"2233081","text":"Thambirajah Tharmadurai (born 22 April 1948), better known as T. T. Durai, is a Singaporean who formerly served as the chief executive officer (CEO) of the non-profit health organisation National Kidney Foundation Singapore (NKF). The central figure in the 2005 National Kidney Foundation Singapore scandal, he was ultimately convicted for deceiving the NKF into paying S$20,000 to his interior designer friend, and sentenced to a three-month jail term. ==Lawsuit over The Straits Times article== Durai and the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) sued Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) and its senior correspondent Susan Long over an article published in The Straits Times on April 19, 2004. Four days after the article appeared, the NKF served a writ on the newspaper. The NKF objected to the first six paragraphs of the article, which carried an account from a plumber who worked on the attached bathroom of Durai's private office suite. The plumber said he \\"lost it\\" when he had to install, among other things, \\"a glass panelled shower, a pricey German toilet bowl and a gold-plated tap\\". The article said the taps were \\"scaled down\\" after Durai's outburst. When contacted regarding the plumber's story, the NKF responded that it was \\"difficult for us to give an answer to enlighten your readers\\" since the newspaper had not said who the man was. Durai had the gold tap replaced with a steel one the week after the article was published. The NKF claimed that the paragraphs implied it had misused funds collected from the public and splurged them on its CEO's office; that it mismanaged public donations; that it had \\"scaled down\\" the installations only because the plumber protested; and that it avoided providing details on the alleged incident. The Straits Times argued that the alleged incident was true, and therefore justified publishing, and that the entire article was not defamatory but a fair comment on the lack of transparency and controversy surrounding the NKF. Two days into the trial, which had been scheduled to last ten days, the NKF withdrew the defamation suits against SPH and the journalist. ===NKF's reserves=== The court was told that the NKF's reserves stood at S$262 million as of July 2003. SPH's lawyer, Davinder Singh, said during the trial that the NKF had been telling Singaporeans that its reserves would not last more than three years, according to statements made by its officials. He argued that if the NKF stopped all fundraising activities and concentrated on treating kidney patients, it would still have enough money to see through its operations for 30 years, based on its expenses scheduled for 2003. In June 2005, the NKF had told The Straits Times that it needed about S$2,600 per month to support each of its 2,000 patients, a total of S$62.4 million per year. The charity cited those figures to bolster its argument that its reserves were not excessive. Based on its expenditure of more than S$60 million a year for dialysis, the reserves would last three years. However, on 12 July 2005, during the trial, the court was shown how the NKF in fact spent far less on dialysis than the public had been led to believe. According to its 2003 audited financial statement, the NKF spent S$31.6 million that year on dialysis and transplantation. Of that amount, S$22.9 million came from dialysis fees it collected from patients and a further S$1.5 million came from other related income. This meant that the NKF was out-of-pocket by only S$7.2 million. Durai initially disagreed with Singh, saying that no-one could be sure patients would continue to pay their share for the treatments. However, he finally agreed that the NKF's assertion that the reserves would last only three years was 'not accurate'. Singh noted that even if the NKF had to foot the entire dialysis bill of $31.6 million a year, its current reserves of S$262 million would last more than eight years. ===Number of patients the NKF served=== Singh argued that the NKF had overstated its patient numbers, and this would have given the impression to the public that more funds were needed to run its operations. In May 2004, Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan informed Parliament that the NKF had treated 1,414 patients in 1999 and 1,512 patients in 2003. A letter written to The Straits Times in April 2004 by Gerard Chuah, the chairman of its Children's Medical Fund board, had claimed that the NKF had 3,000 patients. Singh pointed out the number had been overstated by about 1,000. Durai said he realised there was a mistake only after the letter had been published, but had not corrected it. During cross-examination, Durai admitted that an overestimate had been made and not corrected. When asked why he had done nothing to correct it, Durai said, \\"It was an oversight. I did not think it was of material importance. The donor gives us money because of the brand of the NKF and I did not think it was so important at that point of time to correct this error.\\" Singh suggested that the number had been inflated to create a false impression of need. In fact, according to Khaw's statement in Parliament, the NKF's \\"share\\" of kidney patients in Singapore had dropped, from 54% in 1999 to 44% in 2003. ===Durai's salary=== Durai was paid a monthly salary of S$25,000 in 2002 and received 10 months' performance bonuses (S$250,000) for that year, making a total of S$550,000 for 2002. He was paid a monthly salary of S$25,000 and received 12 months performance bonuses (S$300,000), amounting a total of S$600,000 in both 2003 and 2004. He was paid a total of nearly S$1.8 million in three years from 2002 to 2004. These figures were closely guarded secrets until the trial. There were many occasions when he declined a pay rise but was paid the offered increase in salary, backdated to the time he was offered the pay rise, the following year. Singh said that Durai had tried to give the impression in his affidavit that he was being thoughtful when he agreed to come on board as CEO in 1992 for just $12,000 a month even though he had been offered $20,000. The truth, Singh said, was that Durai had agreed to the lower pay in exchange for freedom to earn extra income outside the NKF. Durai testified that his earnings were up to the board of directors to decide, admitting that he was unethical but arguing that he was not to blame for accepting them. ===First class air travel=== NKF volunteer Archie Ong and aero-modelling instructor Piragasam Singaravelu, who claimed that they had seen Durai travelling in first class on airlines while making NKF business trips, were taken to court separately in 1998. Both apologised and paid damages and costs to the NKF after realising they were effectively fighting a losing battle against the unlimited monetary resources of the NKF. The NKF, including chairman Richard Yong, had maintained that senior executives flew business class for long-haul flights. Durai told the court on 11 July 2005 that he did flew first class. For the past two years, he had been entitled to a fare equal to Singapore Airlines business class rate ‚Äì the equivalent of first class on other airlines. Previously, he had paid the difference on his own. ===Cars=== It was revealed during the trial that the NKF had a fleet of eight cars with company drivers and Durai was one of six officers who could make use of them at any time. The office cars were also used to transport VIPs and guests of the charity. In his affidavit, Durai said that the office fleet was used by officers who had to visit NKF facilities to attend to the needs of the centres and patients. Durai also had his own Mercedes-Benz 200 for his personal and family use, and his wife also drove it. However, the NKF paid the car's road tax and picked up the bills for maintenance and repair. Singh questioned Durai on the cars. Durai said that, as CEO, he was entitled to use any of the cars any time he wanted. He also admitted that he had used the office cars for personal use. ===Durai's undeclared directorships outside the NKF=== While Durai worked full-time as CEO of the NKF, he was also a director of a number of other companies. He was paid sums of up to S$25,000 a year by them, over and above his NKF remuneration package. He never told the NKF board about some of these, and did not list these directorships in his curriculum vitae (CV). It was also revealed that Durai had a business relationship with Matilda Chua, a one-time employee of the NKF, who left to start her own company. Not only did he invest in her business, but the NKF also gave her telemarketing contracts, and she eventually became a member of the NKF board as well. When Singh produced Durai's CV and asked if it were complete, Durai answered, 'Not exactly.' He disclosed that he had once worked for a company known as Bonyad Marketing Industries, which he described as an Iranian charity, for S$7,000 a month. A December 1995 article in The American Spectator describes Bonyad Marketing Industries as a \\"special arms trading company\\" that had \\"in addition to spare parts for Iran's U.S.-built F-4 and F-5 fighters ... been purchasing large quantities of Hewlett Packard and Sun SparcServer computers for use in Iran.\\" Durai said that he was Bonyad's representative in Singapore from 1990 to 1992, but decided to give that up when he became NKF's CEO. Durai admitted that in 2000 he had invested in Chua's company, Global Net Relations, but did not disclose to the NKF board that he was a director of the company. Singh then probed him on the director's fees he had collected while he was working full-time as the NKF's CEO. Durai said he was paid S$25,000 a year each as a director of Amcol Holdings between 1990 and 1996 and an Australian company, Overseas & General, \\"for a couple of years\\". He also received \\"some nominal sum\\" as a director of MediaCorp TV Channel 12. Singh told him, \\"The position is this: While you were expected to be and paid as a full-time CEO, you were earning fees outside NKF which were not disclosed to the NKF or to the public.\\" Durai replied, \\"That's correct. The NKF board gave me the liberty to do so.\\" Singh continued, \\"Mr Durai, your CV is yet another illustration of the lack of transparency with which you operate. You do not come clean on what you do, you do not tell the board what you do, how much you earn. You do not tell the board about your commercial relationship with a person who has a contract with the NKF. Is that transparency?\\" Durai said, \\"They were not very consequential, in my opinion.\\" He said it was not necessary for him to disclose to the board and added that the directorships were \\"just appearances\\". ==Subsequent fallout and public backlash== Just after the trial, when Tan Choo Leng, patron of the NKF and wife of former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, was interviewed, she commented that \\"$600,000 per year is peanuts compared to the reserves the NKF has.\\" This then sparked the \\"Peanut Controversy\\", in which the public was irked by this comment. The public then called for her to apologise for this statement, which Goh Chok Tong did on behalf of his wife. In the days following the trial, around 30,000 donors terminated their monthly contributions to the NKF. An online petition was set up, calling for Durai to step down, which, as of writing, has 43,589 signatures on it. The morning after the trial, the wall outside the NKF headquarters in Kim Keat Road was vandalised by an unknown person, most probably angered by the lack of transparency in NKF. Spraypainted all over the wall were the words 'liar'. On one wall, the words \\"liar\\" (È™óÂ≠ê) and \\"god of liars\\" (Â§ßÈ™ó‰ªô) were spraypainted in Chinese characters along with the Malay words \\"Hang Turi\\", the misspelling referring to Durai. The NKF signboard was also vandalised with the words \\"liar\\" spray painted in both English and Chinese. The graffiti was quickly painted over and the affected areas of the signboard was quickly covered up. These acts were severely condemned and police investigations were carried out. On 14 July 2005, Durai and the NKF Board met with Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan to discuss the future and was told that 'business as usual' would not do. That evening, the NKF called a press conference, during which Durai and the entire NKF Board announced their resignations. An interim board was appointed by the government to keep the organisation going and begin the task of restoring public confidence. Gerard Ee was appointed as interim chairman to oversee the restructuring of the NKF, and Goh Chee Leok took over the post as interim CEO. ==KPMG investigation into NKF== The international accountancy firm KPMG investigated the business activities of NKF and issued a report on 16 December 2005, including the following conclusions:KMPG report, accessible from Channel News Asia Channel News Asia website *In 1995, Durai's pay was increased from S$12,000 to S$18,000. The promotion was backdated six months, so he received another S$36,000. On top of that, Durai received a S$30,000 bonus \\"top-up\\" based on the revised salary. *In 1997, Durai was offered a salary of S$30,000 a month but he chose to accept only S$25,000, a S$7,000 increase over his previous wage. The increment was backdated 11 months, amounting to an extra S$77,000. *From September 1997 to October 2003, his overtime pay amounted to S$187,000. *From May 1995 to November 2003, he encashed his leave entitlement brought in another S$350,000. *In 2004, Durai chalked up an average bill of S$32,952 per month on his corporate credit card. *In 2004, S$70,000 was spent on a \\"study trip\\" to Las Vegas for six of NKF's staff, including Durai, to get fresh ideas on doing charity shows. *In 2004, S$430,000 on movie and concert tickets were given free to \\"nurture\\" donors. *Staff received pay increments as often as four times a year. Former director Matilda Chua's salary rose from S$1,300 to S$12,500 over nine years. *Staff were given exit payments of up to 10 months' salary. *Durai used NKF funds to pay bills relating to his wife's Mercedes, including paying for petrol and repairing the car. *In 2004, the NKF made a surplus of S$993,677 from drug sales. Although the NKF claimed it helped its patients save over S$3.5 million in treatment costs, it had charged its patients a premium for certain discounted drugs, instead of passing the savings on to them. ==Private life== It was reported that Durai spent much of his time reading at home and spending time with his wife, two sons and daughter. Before the KPMG report was out, his daughter wrote a passionate letter to the news media, pleading for the public to restore honour to her father. Durai had refrained from reading newspapers and watching television after the controversy. Durai said that he was prepared for the worst, referring to any legal charges that would be laid on him. In an affidavit submitted to the High Court on September 7, 2007, Durai revealed that has secured a high paying job. He had accepted the position of CEO of a new subsidiary company under Singapore-based real estate management firm Property Facility Services (PFS) ‚Äì a job that would pay him S$25,000 a month. Durai would be based full-time in Abu Dhabi after he had finished serving his sentence. ==Charges and bail== Durai was formally accused of having submitted false invoices between 2003 and 2004 to the NKF to make claims for various consultancy services which were never rendered. One invoice was for S$20,000 and the other, S$5,000. Durai was said to have misled the charity by using the false invoices \\"knowingly . . . with intent to deceive (the NKF)\\". Anyone who uses a false or erroneous document, which to his knowledge is intended to mislead, is guilty of an offence under Section 6(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Durai was released on bail of S$100,000, which was posted by his wife. On June 11, 2007, Durai was found guilty of misleading the charitable organisation with a falsified invoice of S$20,000 which was allegedly for interior design consultancy work done by David Tan, the director of the design firm. The invoice, dated December 29, 2003, was meant for work done for various dialysis centres. For this, Durai was sentenced to three months' imprisonment on June 21. He could have been jailed for up to five years and fined S$100,000. In 2007, Charles Letts, a former Jardine Mattheson & Co director, saved Durai from bankruptcy with a gift of S$1 million. Letts died in 2013. On May 30, 2008, Durai lost the appeal as the presiding judge, Tay Yong Kwang, said that Durai \\"was in a position of trust and authority at the NKF and the return of the money only came about after investigations into the invoices were underway.\\" The judge added that the \\"money in question belonged to a charity whose funds come from well meaning trusting donors\\". Durai's sentence was maintained. However, the judge allowed Durai to defer his sentence to June 10, 2008 because his elderly mother went for a cataract surgery on June 3. A second charge, concerning the S$5,000 invoice, was considered on June 27, 2007. The money was allegedly paid to a company called Decision One International, in September 2003, for finding suitable candidates for a senior management position in the organisation. However, investigations reveal that no such service was rendered to NKF. The charge was later dropped. Durai was released from Queenstown Remand Prison on 11 August 2008. ==Dengue fever== On July 16, 2007, Durai was admitted to National University Hospital after contracting dengue fever.

It received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song for \\"Make Up Your Mind\\", which was written and performed by Randy Newman. The film depicts a hectic 24 hours in a newspaper editor's professional and personal life. The main story of the day is the murder of a couple of visiting businessmen. The reporters discover evidence suggesting a police cover-up of evidence of the suspects' innocence, and rush to scoop the story in the midst of professional, private and financial chaos. ==Plot== The film takes place during a 24-hour period. Henry Hackett is the workaholic metro editor of the New York Sun, a fictionalThe real New York Sun merged with another paper in 1950, but the film version shares the same masthead. Since the film's release, a new incarnation of the Sun has appeared, also using the masthead. New York City tabloid, who loves his job but the long hours and low pay are leading to discontent. He is at risk of the same fate as his editor-in-chief, Bernie White, who put his work first at the expense of his family. Bernie reveals to Henry that he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer, and tries to track down his estranged daughter Deanne in an attempt to reconcile before his time is up. The paper's owner Graham Keighley faces dire financial straits, so he has managing editor Alicia Clark, Henry's nemesis, impose unpopular cutbacks, as she schemes to get a raise in her salary. Alicia is also having an affair with Sun reporter Carl. Henry's wife Martha, a Sun reporter on leave and about to give birth, is fed up because Henry seems to have less and less time for her, and she dislikes Alicia. She urges him to seriously consider an offer to leave the Sun and become an assistant managing editor at the New York Sentinel (based on The New York Times), which would mean more money and respectability for shorter hours, but may also be too boring for his tastes. A hot story is circulating the city, involving the murder of two white businessmen in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Two African-American teenagers are arrested for the crime, which both Henry and Sun columnist Michael McDougal believe to be false charges when they overhear the NYPD discuss the arrest on the Sun office's police scanner. Henry becomes obsessed with the case, getting others from the Sun staff to investigate along with him. He blows his job offer at the Sentinel after he steals information about the case from the editor's notes while being interviewed for the job, reporting it during a Sun staff meeting. Martha discovers through her friend in the Justice Department that the businessmen were bankers who stole a large sum of money from their largest investor, a trucking company with ties to the Mafia. Henry begins to believe that it was a setup and the Brooklyn boys were likely just caught in the midst of it. Henry leaves a dinner with Martha and his parents to go to the police station with McDougal to confirm that the boys were not responsible before they print the story. They corner McDougal's police contact Richie, who, through repeated interrogation and the promise of anonymity, admits that the kids are indeed innocent and just happened to be walking by the scene of the crime when they were caught. Henry and McDougal race back to the Sun office to discover that Alicia has approved the paper's original front-page headline and story stating that the teens were guilty. This results in a physical fight between Henry and Alicia after he tries to stop the presses printing the papers with the wrong information. McDougal is threatened by an angry city official named Sandusky, whom McDougal's column had been tormenting for the past several weeks. Their drunken confrontation in a bar leads to gunfire, which gets Alicia shot in the leg through the wall. Martha is rushed to the hospital for an emergency caesarean section due to uterine hemorrhaging. Alicia is brought to the same hospital and has a change of heart. She calls the Sun office, has the print room stop the run, and the headline is corrected to Henry's suggestion, \\"They Didn't Do It\\", with McDougal's story, just in time for the following morning's circulation. The movie ends with Martha giving birth to a healthy baby boy, and a morning news radio report states that because of the Suns exclusive story, the Brooklyn teens were released from jail with no charges pressed. ==CastProduction== Screenwriter Stephen Koepp, a senior editor at Time magazine, collaborated on the screenplay with his brother David and together they initially came up with \\"A Day in the Life of a Paper\\" as their premise. David said, \\"We wanted a regular day, though this is far from regular.\\" They also wanted to ‚Äúlook at the financial pressures of a paper to get on the street and still tell the truth.‚Äù After writing the character of a pregnant reporter married to the metro editor (that Marisa Tomei ended up playing in the film), both of the Koepps' wives became pregnant. Around this time, Universal Pictures greenlighted the project. For his next project after Far and Away, Ron Howard was looking to do something on the newspaper industry. Steven Spielberg recommended that he get in touch with David Koepp. Howard intended to pitch an idea to the writer, who instead wanted to talk about how much he loved the script for Parenthood. The filmmaker remembers, ‚ÄúI found that pretty flattering, of course, so I asked about the subject of his work-in-progress. The answer was music to my ears: 24 hours at a tabloid newspaper.\\" Howard read their script and remembers, ‚ÄúI liked the fact that it dealt with the behind-the-scenes of headlines. But I also connected with the characters trying to cope during this 24-hour period, desperately trying to find this balance in their personal lives, past and present.‚Äù To prepare for the film, Howard made several visits to the New York Post and Daily News (which would provide the inspiration for the fictional newspaper in the film). He remembers, ‚ÄúYou'd hear stuff from columnists and reporters about some jerk they'd worked with ... I heard about the scorned female reporter who wound up throwing hot coffee in some guy's crotch when she found out he was fooling around with someone else.\\" It was these kinds of stories that inspired Howard to change the gender of the managing editor that Glenn Close would later play. Howard felt the Koepps' script featured a newsroom that was too male-dominated. The writers agreed and changed the character's name from Alan to Alicia but kept the dialogue the same. According to David Koepp, \\"Anything else would be trying to figure out, 'How would a woman in power behave?' And it shouldn't be about that. It should be about how a person in power behaves, and since that behavior is judged one way when it's a man, why should it be judged differently if it's a woman?\\" Howard met with some of the top newspapermen in New York, including former Post editor Pete Hamill and columnists Jimmy Breslin and Mike McAlary (who inspired Randy Quaid's character in the movie). They told the filmmaker how some reporters bypass traffic jams by putting emergency police lights on their cars (a trick used in the movie). Hamill and McAlary also can be seen in cameos. Howard wanted to examine the nature of tabloid journalism. \\"I kept asking, 'Are you embarrassed to be working at the New York Post? Would you rather be working at The Washington Post or The New York Times?' They kept saying they loved the environment, the style of journalism.‚Äù The model for Keaton's character was the Daily News metro editor Richie Esposito. Howard said, ‚ÄúHe was well-dressed but rumpled, mid-to-late 30s, overworked, very articulate and fast-talking. And very, very smart. When I saw him, I thought, that's Henry Hackett. As written.\\" The director also was intrigued by the unsavory aspect of these papers. \\"They were interested in celebrities who were under investigation or had humiliated themselves in some way. I could see they would gleefully glom onto a story that would be very humiliating for someone. They didn't care about that. If they believed their source, they would go with it happily.‚Äù In addition to being influenced by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur‚Äôs famous stage play The Front Page, Howard studied old newspaper movies from the 1930s and 1940s. Howard said, ‚ÄúEvery studio made them, and then they kind of vanished. One of the reasons I thought it would make a good movie today is that it feels fresh and different.‚Äù One of Howard's goals was to cram in as much information about a 24-hour day in the newspaper business as humanly possible. He said, ‚ÄúI'm gonna get as many little details right as possible: a guy having to rewrite a story and it bugs the hell out of him, another guy talking to a reporter on the phone and saying, 'Well, it's not Watergate for God's sake.' Little, tiny ‚Äì you can't even call them subplots ‚Äì that most people on the first screening won't even notice, probably. It's just sort of newsroom background.‚Äô‚Äù ==ReceptionBox office=== The Paper was given a limited release in five theaters on March 18, 1994 where it grossed $175,507 on its opening weekend. It later expanded its release to 1,092 theaters where it made $7 million over that weekend. The film went on to gross $38.8 million in North America and $9.6 million in the rest of the world for a total of $48.4 million worldwide. ===Critical response=== The Paper received positive reviews from critics and holds an 88% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 34 reviews with the consensus stating: \\"Fast and frenetic, The Paper captures the energy of the newsroom thanks to its cast and director on first-rate form.\\" Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F. In his review for the Boston Globe, Jay Carr wrote, \\"It takes a certain panache to incorporate the ever-present threat of your own extinction into the giddy tradition of the newspaper comedy, but The Paper pulls it off. There's no point pretending that I'm objective about this one. I know it's not Citizen Kane, but it pushes my buttons\\". Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, ‚ÄúIn the end, The Paper offers splashy entertainment that's a lot like a daily newspaper itself ‚Äì hot news cools fast.‚Äù Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \\"B\\" rating and Owen Gleiberman praised Michael Keaton's performance: \\"Keaton is at his most urgent and winning here. His fast-break, neurotic style ‚Äì owlish stare, motor mouth ‚Äì is perfect for the role of a compulsive news junkie who lives for the rush of his job\\", but felt that the film was \\"hampered by its warmed-over plot, which seems designed to teach Henry and the audience lessons\\". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin was critical of the film. \\"Each principal has a problem that is conveniently addressed during this one-day interlude, thanks to a screenplay (by David Koepp and Stephen Koepp) that feels like the work of a committee. The film's general drift is to start these people off at fever pitch and then let them gradually unveil life's inner meaning as the tale trudges toward resolution.\\" Rita Kempley, in her review for The Washington Post, wrote, \\"Ron Howard still thinks women belong in the nursery instead of the newsroom. Screenwriters David Koepp of Jurassic Park and his brother Stephen (of Time magazine) are witty and on target in terms of character, but their message in terms of male and female relations is a prehistoric one.\\" In an interview, New York journalist and author Robert Caro praised The Paper, calling it \\"a great newspaper movie.\\" == Year-end lists == * 10th ‚Äì Christopher Sheid, The Munster Times * Top 10 (listed alphabetically, not ranked) ‚Äì Mike Mayo, The Roanoke Times * Honorable mention ‚Äì Bob Carlton, The Birmingham News ==References* * Category:1994 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Randy Newman Category:Films produced by Brian Grazer Category:Films directed by Ron Howard Category:1994 comedy-drama films Category:Films about journalists Category:Films about newspaper publishing Category:Films set in New York City Category:Imagine Entertainment films Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Films with screenplays by David Koepp Category:American comedy-drama films ","title":"The Paper (film)"},{"id":"2233096","text":"Gilchrist Olympio (born 26 December 1936) is a Togolese politician who was a long-time opponent of the regime of Gnassingbe Eyadema and was President of the Union of Forces for Change (UFC), Togo's main opposition party from the 1990s til 2013.Profile at UFC website .

On 5 May 1992, his convoy was attacked in an ambush in Soudou, in the north of Togo; 12 people were killed, and Olympio himself was seriously injured, spending a year recovering in hospitals in France and the United Kingdom. Following the attack, Olympio lived in exile in Paris.Nick Tattersall, \\"Exiled opposition chief to run for president\\", Reuters (IOL), 3 March 2005. An investigation by the International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH) found that Eyad√©ma's son Ernest Gnassingb√© was in charge of the commandos who perpetrated the attack. Prior to the August 1993 presidential election, Olympio rejected the choice of Edem Kodjo as the sole candidate of the Collective of Democratic Opposition (COD II), and on 23 July 1993, was designated as the UFC's presidential candidate.\\"D√âMOCRATISATION √Ä LA TOGOLAISE\\" (\\"CHRONOLOGIE\\"), T√®t√® T√©t√©, 1998 (diastode.org) .

Olympio claimed to have won the 1998 election, however, and demanded that the election be held over again; he also wanted the March 1999 parliamentary election, which was boycotted by the opposition, to be held over again. He initially refused to attend the Inter-Togolese Dialogue held in Lom√© in mid-1999 due to security concerns, but on 26 July 1999 he arrived in Lom√© from Ghana to participate. Although the dialogue involved many political parties, Olympio demanded exclusive and direct talks between the UFC and Eyad√©ma's party, the Rally of the Togolese People (RPT), regarding the 1998 election. This did not happen, and other opposition parties complained that they would be marginalized by such talks between the UFC and the RPT. Olympio consequently returned to Ghana after spending only hours in Togo.\\"Togo: Olympio leaves talks prematurely\\", IRIN, 27 July 1999. Under the terms of a 2002 constitutional amendment, all presidential candidates were required to have lived in Togo for at least one year prior to the election. This created a legal barrier to Olympio's candidacy in subsequent elections, since he had been living outside of Togo since 1992. In 2003, Olympio was deemed ineligible to run in the June 2003 presidential election by the electoral commission on the grounds that he did not have a certificate of residency and a recent receipt of tax payments. On 26 April 2003, Olympio returned to Togo, saying that he did not have any taxable income in Togo. Olympio appealed the electoral commission's decision to the Constitutional Court, but it ruled against him on 6 May.\\"TOGO: Constitutional Court upholds Olympio's rejection\\", IRIN, 7 May 2003. Emmanuel Bob-Akitani, the First Vice-President of the UFC, ran in place of Olympio; Eyad√©ma won the election. After Eyad√©ma died in office in February 2005, Olympio said on 3 March 2005 that he had been chosen as the UFC candidate for the early presidential election that would be held as a result of Eyad√©ma's death. He was nevertheless barred from running, and Bob-Akitani again ran unsuccessfully as the UFC candidate in the April 2005 election.

Olympio was re-elected as National President of the UFC on 19 July 2008; he was also unanimously chosen as the party's candidate for the 2010 presidential election. Olympio said on this occasion that he accepted the \\"responsibility to lead the Togolese people to victory\\", and he denounced the RPT regime, saying that it had brought Togo to ruin through four decades of mismanagement and repression.\\"L‚ÄôUFC a d√©sign√© son candidat pour la pr√©sidentielle\\", Republicoftogo.com, 20 July 2008 . He ultimately withdrew his candidacy, citing health reasons,Les Togolais √©lisent leur pr√©sident, Lib√©ration, 3 March 2010 and was replaced by Jean-Pierre Fabre as the UFC candidate. == 2010 accord with the ruling party== In 2010, in the aftermath of the presidential election, while the FRAC leaders and activists demonstrated for several weeks to claim victory for Jean-Pierre Fabre, Gilchrist Olympio signed a political agreement for participation in a government of national recovery in a spirit of power sharing with the ruling party. This agreement, which granted seven ministerial portfolios to the UFC, caused an outcry among UFC activists, who considered it treachery. This unilateral decision taken without consultation with the national office of the party caused a severe crisis in the party. After an unsuccessful attempt by Fabre and allies to eject Olympio from UFC, the National Alliance for Change (ANC) led by Jean-Pierre Fabre and his companions was created in October 2010. ==End of political Prestige == In the aftermath of 2013 legislative election, Fabre's ANC emerged as the main opposition party when its coalition (Sauvons le Togo) won 19 seats in the National Assembly. Olympio's UFC lost the electorate and won just three seats. Olympio remains President of the UFC but his standing in Togo's politics has become ambiguous, as he endorsed neither candidate in the 2015 presidential election. ==References *Profile of Olympio Category:1936 births Category:Living people Category:Togolese economists Category:Togolese people of Ghanaian descent Category:Togolese democracy activists Category:Union of Forces for Change politicians Category:Children of national leaders ","title":"Gilchrist Olympio"},{"id":"2233098","text":"Route of the 2005 Tour de France The 2005 Tour de France was the 92nd edition of Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours.

Nearly everything that could fail, failed. First he slipped and fell at a rotonde after 4 km. This caused his specially calibrated bike to ride suboptimally. He demanded a new hind wheel, but instead got a whole new bike. Not happy with this bike, he had to wait for the mechanic to fix his personal bike. This caused him to panic, lose his self-confidence and his ability to cut curves. On a technical downhill part he saltoed into a ditch. In total, he changed his bike two times and his wheels two times. *Santiago Botero: Missed a curve. { Stage 20 result {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rider ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Time -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  ~~1~~  ~~~~Yellow jersey  ~~~~ style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  ~~~~-  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 23\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  3    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 17\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  4    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 33\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  5    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 1' 54\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  6    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 2' 02\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  7    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 2' 06\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  8    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 2' 26\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  9  Illes Balears  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 2' 51\\" -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  10  Illes Balears  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 3' 06\\" }  General classification after stage 20 {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rider ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Time -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  ~~1~~  ~~~~Yellow jersey  ~~~~ style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  ~~~~-  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2    style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  + 4' 40\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  3    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 6' 21\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  4  Illes Balears  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 9' 59\\" -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  5    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 11' 25\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  6    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 11' 27\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  7    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 11' 33\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  8    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 11' 55\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  9    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 12' 44\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 16' 04\\" } } ==Stage 21 == 23 July 2005 ‚Äî Corbeil-Essonnes to Paris Champs-√âlys√©es, { Stage 21 result {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rider ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Time -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  3    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  4    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  5    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  6  Liberty Seguros-W√ºrth  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  7    style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  8    style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  9    style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  s.t. -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10    style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  s.t. }  General classification after stage 21 {  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rider ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Time -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  ~~1~~  ~~~~Yellow jersey  ~~~~ style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  ~~~~-  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 4' 40\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  3    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 6' 21\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  4  Illes Balears  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 9' 59\\" -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  5    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 11' 01\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  6    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 11' 21\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  7    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 11' 33\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  8    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 11' 55\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  9    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 12' 44\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10    style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  + 16' 04\\" } } ==References== Tour De France, Stage 12 To Stage 21, 2005 Category:Tour de France stages ","title":"2005 Tour de France, Stage 12 to Stage 21"},{"id":"2233103","text":"Germaine Maurice Lindsay (23 September 1985 - 7 July 2005), also known as Abdullah Shaheed Jamal, was one of the four suicide bombers who detonated bombs on three trains on the London Underground and a bus in central London during the 7 July 2005 London bombings, killing 56 people (including themselves), and injuring more than 700. Lindsay detonated the bomb that killed himself and 26 other people on a train travelling on the Piccadilly line between King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square tube stations. ==Biography== Lindsay (second from left) alongside Mohammad Sidique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer captured on CCTV at Luton railway station at 7:21 a.m., 7 July.Image of bombers' deadly journey, BBC News, 17 July 2005, accessed 3 December 2006. Lindsay was born in Jamaica; after moving to Britain at age five, he lived in Dalton, West Yorkshire, where he attended Rawthorpe Junior School and Rawthorpe High School.Sapsted, David and Duncan Gardham. \\"Lost years of the 'nice boy' who killed 25\\". Daily Telegraph, 16 July 2005. He subsequently moved to Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. Lindsay had converted to Islam shortly after his mother, Maryam McCleod Ismaiyl, converted to the faith in 2001 and encouraged him to do the same. He worked part-time as a carpet fitter and supplemented his income by selling covers for mobile phones at a local market. Lindsay married a woman from Kinnitty, County Offaly, Ireland, in a traditional Islamic religious ceremony, which had no legal recognition in the UK. He divorced her eight days later in order to marry Samantha Lewthwaite. Lewthwaite, a native of County Down, Northern Ireland, had converted to Islam at the age of 15 after moving to Aylesbury. Lewthwaite lived with him and gave birth to their second child two months after his death. Abdullah el-Faisal, a controversial imam convicted of attempting to incite sectarian murders in 2003, later claimed to have been close to Lindsay. ===Wife=== Lindsay's wife, Samantha Lewthwaite, denied his involvement until authorities produced forensic evidence to confirm his identity.\\"NewMuslim at 15, a bombing suspect at 19\\" International Herald Tribune 18 July 2005. She later said she abhorred the attacks and that her husband's mind had been poisoned by \\"radicals\\".\\"Widow of bomber 'abhors' attack\\" BBC News, 23 September 2005 By 2015, she herself had been accused of causing the deaths of more than 400 people. Now dubbed the 'White Widow', Lewthwaite is an alleged member of the Somalia-based radical Islamic militant group Al-Shabaab. ==Involvement in London bombings== Lindsay detonated his bomb, killing 26 people, on a train travelling between King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square stations. A raid by Scotland Yard found no explosives at Lindsay's flat. Lindsay is believed to have hired one of the cars left at Luton railway station on 7 July before the bombers made their rail journey to London. Abdul Dayan, the imam of the Jamia Ghausia mosque in Aylesbury, said that Lindsay did not attend, and did not mix with the largely Pakistani Muslim community. ==House arson== On 22 July 2005, police and fire services were called to Lindsay's home in Aylesbury after neighbours reported a strong smell of petrol coming from it. It was suspected to be a retaliatory arson attack on the empty property.\\"Attempted arson at bomber's house\\", BBC News. 22 July 2005. Later it was revealed in the local press that Lindsay's wife and son were living under \\"police protection\\" and would not be returning home. In December 2005, two 17-year-olds were convicted at Aylesbury Crown Court of arson in circumstances where they were reckless as to whether the life of another person would be endangered and each sentenced to 18 months youth detention with a training order. ==See also== *List of notable converts to Islam ==References *\\"Blue Watch relive the bomb hell inside carriage 346A\\" by Mark Townsend, The Observer, 9 October 2005 *Profile of Germaine Lindsay *Profile of Radical Jamaican-born Cleric Sheikh Abdullah al-Faisal al-Jamaikee published by the Jamestown Foundation in Washington, DC *\\" Fourth bomber's name disclosed\\" (Accessed 15 July 2005) BBC News *\\"Market town may hold clues to fourth suspect\\" (Accessed 15 July 2005) Financial Times *Russell Square explosion Category:1985 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Converts to Sunni Islam Category:Islam in the United Kingdom Category:Islamic terrorism in England Category:Jamaican emigrants to the United Kingdom Category:Jamaican Islamists Category:British Islamists Category:People from Aylesbury Category:People from Huddersfield Category:Perpetrators of the July 2005 London bombings Category:Jamaican criminals Category:Jamaican murderers Category:21st-century Jamaican criminals Category:Suicide bombers ","title":"Germaine Lindsay"},{"id":"2233108","text":"Everybody Hates Chris is an American period sitcom television series that is based around the troubled experiences of comedian Chris Rock as a teenager.

It was also one of the first uses of edge-rails for a wagonway. (This should not be confused with the Charnwood Forest Railway.) ==Origin== The now derelict and dried up Charnwood Forest Canal south of Osgathorpe. The remains of Junction House alongside the Charnwood Forest Canal, at the junction with the Barrow Hill branch south of Osgathorpe, in 2009. This is the last remaining building of the Charnwood Forest Canal. The now derelict Charnwood Forest Canal alongside the entrance to Longcliffe Golf Club in Nanpantan. Until the end of the eighteenth century the City of Leicester had received its supplies of coal by packhorse from the Charnwood Forest coal mines around Swannington. However, in 1778, the Loughborough Canal opened up the River Soar from the Trent to Loughborough, and the opening of the Erewash Canal the following year allowed a ready supply of coal from the Nottinghamshire coalfields into Leicestershire at reduced prices.Owen, C. (1984) The Leicestershire and South Derbyshire Coalfield 1200-1900 Ashbourne: Moorland Publishing Co. Ltd. In 1785, proposals to extend the Loughborough Canal south from Loughborough to Leicester were opposed by the influential Leicestershire coalmasters, even when a canal linking the mining area to the canal at Loughborough was also proposed. Gradually, however, they warmed to the idea and even came to consider a canal of their own linked to either Loughborough or the proposed Ashby Canal. By 1790 serious opposition to a branch canal from Loughborough to the coal field, known as the \\"Forest Line\\", had been won over and the following year the Leicester Navigation Company obtained an act of parliament to extend the Soar Navigation from Loughborough to Leicester, and to build the Forest Line. The considerable height difference between Nanpantan and Loughborough would have required a number of locks, for which there was not enough water, so the canal terminated at Nanpantan where goods had to be transhipped onto a horse-drawn wagonway which connected to Loughborough wharf. The tramway was engineered by William Jessop who used an iron edge-rail railway, in contrast to his partner Benjamin Outram, who, for other such lines, preferred the traditional iron \\"L\\" shaped flange-rail plateway. Wagonways also linked the other terminus of the Forest Line at Thringstone to the coal mines and to the limestone quarries at Barrow Hill and Cloud Hill. Considerable difficulties were encountered in constructing both the Soar Navigation and the Forest Line, and it was not until 1794 that they were both opened. ==History== Use of the Forest Line was limited until the Blackbrook Reservoir feeder was finished. During the floods of 1799 this collapsed, destroying some earthworks and an aqueduct, and the canal went out of use for two years. Even after some repairs were carried out, further damage occurred and what little trade there had been did not return. Stevenson suggests \\"the problems ... stemmed partially from the hybrid nature of its construction.\\" That is, it was part canal, part wagonway.Stevenson.P.S. (Ed), (1989) The Midland Counties Railway, Railway and Canal Historical Society However, note that Griffin has suggested that technical, financial and legal problems at the coal mines served by the canal caused the amount of coal to be carried to be reduced to uneconomic levels.Giffin.C.P., (1978) Transport Change and the Development of the Leicestershire Coalfield in the Canal Age: A Reinterpretation, Journal of Transport History, 4 In 1808 the company sought to abandon the Forest Line but were advised that this would require a costly act of parliament, so they turned this down, and the unused canal became derelict. In 1830 the Leicester and Swannington Railway was authorised, which greatly affected the transport situation in the area. The canal company was dismayed to receive a formal request by the Earl of Stamford that the Forest Line be put into good order to carry limestone. A proposal was drawn up to convert the canal to a wagonway or railway throughout and a bill was presented to parliament but was opposed and was not passed. The company tried to sell off the land of the canal piecemeal but this was deemed to be illegal without an act of parliament. In the end a landowner who wanted to buy some of the land agreed to pay for a private bill and the Forest Line was officially abandoned in 1846.Franks, D.L., (1975) The Ashby and Nuneaton Joint Railway together with The Charnwood Forest Railway Sheffield: Turntable Publications ==After the canal's closure== It was not until 1832 that the opening of the Leicester and Swannington Railway allowed the Leicestershire miners to regain a competitive advantage. The Nottinghamshire coal miners responded to this by proposing a railway line extending from the Mansfield and Pinxton Railway, which had been opened in 1819. This eventually led to the building of Midland Counties Railway, which became a founding partner in the Midland Railway. Subsequently the Charnwood Forest Railway (opened in 1883 and closed in 1963) took over part of the route of the Forest Line between Grace Dieu and Shepshed, including the aqueduct over the Blackbrook.Williams, B.C.J., (1994) An Exploration of the Leicester Navigation (celebrating 1794 - 1994) Sileby: published by the Leicester Navigation 200 Group Remains of the canal can still be seen in places, particularly: *South of Osgathorpe, a section of the former towpath remains a public footpath from Snarrows Road, Osgathorpe alongside a good section of canal including a length of the junction, past the remains of the canal junction house ; *Embankments and pond south of Grace Dieu Priory. *The aqueduct over an accommodation track near the Blackbrook (subsequently modified and widened by the Charnwood Forest Railway) ; *A section of canal between the aqueduct and Tickow lane *A section of former towpath in Shepshed between Charnwood Road and Leicester Road; *The former towpath, now a public footpath from the back gardens of houses on Nanpantan Road, Nanpantan , over Snells Nook Lane, and across Longcliffe Golf Club . ==See also== *Canals of the United Kingdom *History of the British canal system ==ReferencesSwannington Heritage Trust * Route Map Category:Canals in England Category:Canals in Leicestershire Category:History of Leicestershire Category:Canals opened in 1794 Category:1794 establishments in England ","title":"Charnwood Forest Canal"},{"id":"2233118","text":"Joseph Parker. Carlo Pellegrini, 1884. Joseph Parker (9 April 1830 ‚Äì 28 November 1902) was an English Congregational minister. ==Life== Born in Hexham, Northumberland, Parker was the son of Teasdale Parker, a stonemason, and Elizabeth (n√©e Dodd). He managed to pick up a fair education, which afterwards he constantly supplemented. In the revolutionary years from 1845 to 1850 young Parker as a local preacher and temperance orator gained a reputation for vigorous utterance. He was influenced by Thomas Cooper, the Chartist, and Edward Miall, the Liberationist, and was much associated with Joseph Cowen, afterwards MP for Newcastle upon Tyne. At the time, he was wooing a local girl ‚Äì Ann Nesbitt, daughter of William Nesbitt, a farmer of Horsley‚Äìon‚ÄìTyne. He referred to her as \\"Annie, the soul I loved, the girl that saved me, and made me a man\\". Horsley was about ten miles from Hexham, and he became acquainted with the Nesbitts through his preaching there, and Mr Nesbitt, a trustee and deacon of Horsley Congregational Church was especially interested in the young preacher, who, on Sunday nights, brought them the news of the town and slept in a \\"snug little chamber\\" in the old farmhouse. Ann and Joseph were married on 15 November 1851 in Horsley Congregational Church, though Joseph was only twenty-one years old, and they had twelve years' happy married life ‚Äì consisting of six months in Horsley, a year or two in London, five years in Banbury, and five in Manchester ‚Äì until Ann died in 1863. However, when Horsley Congregational Church was rebuilt, Dr. Parker presented a beautiful stained glass window, bearing the following inscription: \\"In ever loving memory of Ann Nesbitt, for twelve years the devoted wife of Joseph Parker, Minister of the City Temple, London, this window is reverently and gratefully erected by the man whose life she did so much to mould\\". The pulpit of grained oak was given at the same time and was inscribed: \\"In grateful memory of William Nesbitt of Horsley Hills, to whom the Church herein assembling is deeply indebted for long-continued and invaluable service, this pulpit is affectionately erected by his son-in-law Joseph Parker.\\" Both the stained glass window and the pulpit can still be viewed at Horsley Congregational Church. The site is now managed by The Hearth Centre (Horsley) Ltd locally known as The Hearth ‚Äì see www.thehearth.co.uk . Regular church services are still held in the church. In the spring of 1852 he wrote to Dr John Campbell, minister of Whitefield Tabernacle, Moorfields, London, for advice as to entering the Congregational ministry, and after a short probation he became Campbell's assistant. He also attended lectures in logic and philosophy at University College London. From 1853 to 1858 he was pastor at Banbury. His next charge was at Cavendish Street, Manchester, where he rapidly made himself felt as a power in English Nonconformity. While here he published a volume of lectures entitled Church Questions, and, anonymously, Ecce Deus (1868), a work provoked by Seeley's Ecce Homo. The University of Chicago conferred on him the degree of D.D. In 1869, he returned to London as minister of the Poultry church, founded by Thomas Goodwin. Almost at once he began the scheme which resulted in the erection of the great City Temple in Holborn Viaduct. It cost ¬£70,000, and was opened on 19 May 1874. From this centre his influence spread far and wide. His stimulating and original sermons, delivered with a ready command of vigorous English, made him one of the best known personalities of his time. Dr. Parker exchanged a number of friendly letters with Spurgeon, and was invited to speak on Spurgeon's fiftieth birthday. One of Spurgeon's biographers, A. Cunningham Burley, makes an extended comparison between Spurgeon and Dr. Parker; Burley wrote, \\"The wonderful thing is that these two men [Spurgeon and Parker], so strangely compounded, drew closer together as time went on. They learned (surely in the school of Christ) to praise each other's genius and to rejoice in each other's success.\\" Dr Parker was twice chairman of the London Congregational Board and twice of the Congregational Union of England and Wales. In 1887 he visited the United States, where he delivered a eulogy on Henry Ward Beecher, with whom he had been on very intimate terms. On 22 December 1864, Parker married Emma Jane, daughter of Andrew Common JP, banker, of Sunderland. Her death, on 26 January 1899, was a blow from which he never fully recovered. She was buried at the West Hampstead Cemetery. Parker was commemorated by the Parker Memorial Congregational Church, which opened in November 1907 in Crowborough, East Sussex. The red-brick church, which cost ¬£2,000, is now called the United Church and is used by the town's United Reformed and Methodist communities. On his death (in London) he was succeeded as minister of the City Temple by Reginald John Campbell. ==Preaching== Parker's preaching differed widely from his contemporaries like Spurgeon and Alexander Maclaren. He did not follow outlines or list his points, but spoke extemporaneously, inspired by his view of the spirit and attitude behind his Scripture text. He expressed himself frankly, with conviction and passion. His transcriber commented that he was at his best when he strayed furthest from his loose outlines. He did not often delve into detailed textual or critical debates. His preaching was neither systematic theology nor expository commentary, but sound more like his personal meditations. Writers of the time describe his delivery as energetic, theatrical and impressive, attracting at various times famous people and politicians such as William Gladstone.Robert Henry. The Golden Age of Preaching: Men Who Moved the Masses. 2005. ==Influence== Joseph Parker's chief legacy is not his theology but his gift for oratory. Charles Spurgeon praised his originality, writing, \\"Dr. Parker's track is his own and the jewels he lets fall in his progress are from his own casket.\\" Alexander Whyte commented on Joseph Parker: \\"He is by far the ablest man now standing in the English- speaking pulpit. He stands in the pulpit of Thomas Goodwin, the Atlas of Independency. And Dr. Parker is a true and worthy successor to this great Apostolic Puritan.\\"Adamson, William. The Life of Joseph Parker. London, 1894. p. 132. Among his biographers, Margaret Bywater called him \\"the most outstanding preacher of his time,\\"Bywater. Joseph Parker. Independent Press, 1961. and Angus Watson wrote that \\"no one had ever spoken like him.\\"Angus Watson. Great Christians. ed. R. S. Forman. London, 1934. Another writer and pastor, Ian Maclaren, offered the following tribute: \\"Dr. Parker occupies a lonely place among the preachers of our day. His position among preachers is the same as that of a poet among ordinary men of letters.\\"Adamson. p. 133-134. ==Writings== Parker was pre-eminently a preacher, and his published works are chiefly sermons and expositions. Among them are: * Hidden Springs (1864) * Ecce Deus: Essays on the Life and Doctrine of Jesus Christ (1868) * City Temple Sermons (1869‚Äì1870) * Ecce Homo: The Paraclete (1874) * The Inner Life of Christ (1881) * Apostolic Life (1884) * The People's Bible, in 25 vol.

Its main objectives are to provide a unified fare system, requiring only a single ticket for journeys with transfers between different operating companies, and to facilitate and speed up travel by harmonising the individual companies' schedules. At its inception in 1965, HVV was the first organisation of this kind worldwide. In 2010 HVV provides rail, bus and ferry transportation for an area of 8,616 square kilometres with approximately 3.6 million inhabitants in the states of Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony. HVV has approximately 1.95 million customers on an average working day.HVV Figures 2006, pdf (Retrieved on May 18, 2008 from the HVV website) HVV acts is the overall coordinating body for transport in the conurbation, with representation by the Hamburger Hochbahn (Hamburg elevated railway); Deutsche Bahn (DB, German Federal Railways); AKN railway company (Altona-Kaltenkirchen- Neum√ºnster Railway); HADAG Seetouristik und F√§hrdienst AG (HADAG sea-tourism and ferry service plc); VHH (Verkehrsbetriebe Hamburg-Holstein / Hamburg Holstein Transport Ltd), and KVG Stade (Kraftverkehrgesellschaft Stade, GmbH / Motor Traffic Company, LLC). With an average of 50,000 commuters per day the Metrobus 5 bus line is the busiest in Europe. In the city centre, stops are served without a specific schedule every two or three minutes and since December 2005, extra long double-articulated buses have been used. ==History== HVV was founded on November 29, 1965, with the four initial partners the Hamburger Hochbahn AG (HHA), the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB), the HADAG Seetouristik und F√§hrdienst AG and Verkehrsbetriebe Hamburg-Holstein (VHH). The first results that the new organization delivered came on January 1, 1967, with a unified fare structure, pooling of receipts and coordinated systemwide timetables across all modes of transport. ==Organisation== The public transport authorities (PTAs) are also the tendering organizations and owners of the limited liability company Hamburger Verkehrsverbund (GmbH). The Free and Hanseatic city of Hamburg (85.5%), the State of Schleswig-Holstein (3%), the State of Lower Saxony (2%) and the Districts Herzogtum Lauenburg, Pinneberg, Segeberg, Stormarn, Harburg, L√ºneburg and Stade (9.5%) are these PTAs. ===Services=== Railway lines in the HVV network Rail transport In 2006 the HVV organised 27 rapid transit rail lines with a length of 881 km, with the following operators: * AKN Eisenbahn (AKN) website * S-Bahn Hamburg GmbH , part of Deutsche Bahn group, operating the Hamburg S-Bahn * DB Regio AG (Region Niedersachsen/Bremen), part of Deutsche Bahn group * DB Regionalbahn Schleswig-Holstein GmbH (RBSH) * Eisenbahnen und Verkehrsbetriebe Elbe-Weser, operating rail and bus services * Hamburger Hochbahn, operating the U-Bahn and many bus services in Hamburg * metronom Eisenbahngesellschaft * NBE nordbahn Eisenbahngesellschaft mbH & Co.

It was typically deployed in the anti-tank units of armoured and motor rifle regiments to protect flanks against counter-attacks during rapid advances. In 1970, it was replaced in production by the T-12A or MT-12 \\"Rapira\\", which features a new smoothbore gun, the 100 mm 2A29 gun, as well as a redesigned carriage and gun shield to protect the crew from machine gun fire and shell splinters. Thanks to the redesigned carriage, which has a bigger wheel base, the MT-12 can be towed by the MT-LB, at speeds up to 60 km/h on road or 25 km/h cross-country. The 2A29R \\"Ruta\\" or MT-12R is a version with a RLPK-1 radar for engaging targets in a poor visibility environment (smoke/fog). From 1981, the gun could fire laser beam-riding guided missiles 9M117 Kastet (weapon system 9K116) and carried the new designator 2A29K \\"Kastet\\" or MT-12K. The weapon was planned to be superseded by the 2A45 Sprut-B 125 mm smooth bore anti-tank gun. Modern western tanks' frontal armour protection is in excess of what can be penetrated by a 100 mm gun from anything but point-blank range ‚Äì even using the most modern APFSDS round. For a tank that can manoeuvre to take advantage of the enemy's weaknesses this is less of a problem ‚Äì but for a weapon that is primarily defensive, this is a serious problem. Today, the T-12 is applied mostly in the role of ordinary artillery, using FRAG-HE shells. In 2017, the Algerian military displayed a locally developed variant mounted on a Mercedes- Benz Zetros truck. It includes four stabilization legs to absorb firing impacts. ==Description== The gun requires a crew of six: commander, driver of the towing vehicle, gun layer, loader, and two ammunition crewmen. When the MT-LB is used as the transporter, 20 rounds are typically carried (10 APFSDS, 4 HE-Frag, 6 HEAT). Since the weapon is a smoothbore, all the ammunition is finned for accuracy during flight. The standard equipment consists of the panoramic PG-1M sight for indirect fire, and an OP4M-40U telescope for direct fire. The APN-5-40 or APN-6-40 are used for direct fire by night. The gun can be fitted with the LO-7 ski gear for travel across snow or swampy ground. == Ammunition == Note: penetration numbers for RHA at 90 degrees. === APFSDS === BM-2 APFSDS projectile. ;3BM-2 APFSDS-T Tungsten * Round weight: * Projectile weight: * Muzzle velocity: * Maximum range: * Penetration: **230 mm at 500 m (9 in at 550 yd) **180 mm at 2,000 m (7 in at 2,200 yd) **140 mm at 3,000 m (5.5 in at 3,300 yd) ;3BM23/3UBM10 APFSDS * Round weight: * Projectile weight: * Muzzle velocity: * Maximum range: * Penetration: 225 mm at 1000 m (8.8 in at 1100 yd) === HEAT === ;3BK16M/3UBK8 * Round weight: * Projectile weight: * Muzzle velocity: * Maximum range: * Penetration: === HE-FRAG === ;3OF12/3OF35 * Round weight: * Projectile weight: * Muzzle velocity: * Maximum range (indirect): === Guided projectile === ;9K117 Kastet 3UBK10/3UBK10M Beam riding laser guided projectile. * Round weight: * Projectile weight: * Average speed: * Range: * Penetration: ==Operators== Map of T-12 operators in blue with former operators in red Armenian Army T-12 in Yerevan *: 10 * *: 200; 126 operational in 2016. * *: 100 *: 50 *: 16 *: 106; 16 operational in 2009. *: 68 *: 18 *: 36 *: 2,526; mostly in reserve. *: 72 *: 500 *: 36 ===Former operators=== *: 267 *: 100 *: 100 * People's Republic of Kampuchea: 15 *: 25 *: 25 *: 72 * *: 350 == Variants Romania=== * A407 - This artillery system was designed by Arsenal-Resita and is very similar to the MT-12.

Secreted proteins and extracellular parts of membrane proteins that pass through the Golgi apparatus may be sulfated. Sulfation was first discovered by Bettelheim in bovine fibrinopeptide B in 1954Tyrosine-O-sulfate in a peptide from fibrinogen. F. R. Bettelheim, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1954, 76 (10), pp 2838‚Äì2839, and later found to be present in animals and plants but not in prokaryotes or in yeast. ==Function== Sulfation plays a role in strengthening protein-protein interactions. Types of human proteins known to undergo tyrosine sulfation include adhesion molecules, G-protein-coupled receptors, coagulation factors, serine protease inhibitors, extracellular matrix proteins, and hormones. Tyrosine O-sulfate is a stable molecule and is excreted in urine in animals. No enzymatic mechanism of tyrosine sulfate desulfation is known to exist. By knock-out of TPST genes in mice, it may be observed that tyrosine sulfation has effects on the growth of the mice, such as body weight, fecundity, and postnatal viability. ==Mechanism== Sulfation is catalyzed by tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST) in the Golgi apparatus. The reaction catalyzed by TPST is a transfer of sulfate from the universal sulfate donor 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to the side-chain hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue. Sulfation sites are tyrosine residues exposed on the surface of the protein typically surrounded by acidic residues; a detailed description of the characteristics of the sulfation site is available from PROSITE (PROSITE pattern: PS00003) and predicted by an on-line tool named the SulfinatorMonigatti F., Gasteiger E., Bairoch A., Jung E., The Sulfinator: predicting tyrosine sulfation sites in protein sequences, Bioinformatics 18:769-770(2002). . Two types of tyrosylprotein sulftotransferases (TPST-1 and TPST2) have been identified. ==Regulation== There is very limited evidence that the TPST genes are subject to transcriptional regulation and tyrosine O-sulfate is very stable and cannot be easily degraded by mammalian sulfatases. Tyrosine O-sulfation is an irreversible process in vivo. == Clinical Significance == It has been shown that the sulfation of Tyr1680 in Factor VIII is essential for effective binding to vWF. Thus, when this is mutated, patients may suffer mild haemophiliac symptoms due to increased turnover. ==Antibody for detection of tyrosine-sulfated epitopes== In 2006, an article was published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry describing the production and characterization of an antibody called PSG2. This antibody shows exquisite sensitivity and specificity for epitopes containing sulfotyrosine independent of the sequence context. ==References== * * Category:Post-translational modification ","title":"Tyrosine sulfation"},{"id":"2233140","text":"Future Force Warrior was a United States military advanced technology demonstration project that was part of the Future Combat Systems project. The FFW project sought to create a lightweight, fully integrated infantryman combat system. It was one technology demonstration project in a series of network-centric, next-generation infantry combat projects the U.S. military have developed over the past decade, such as the Soldier Integrated Protective Ensemble technology demonstration program, Land Warrior, and Transformation of the United States Army. The Future Force Warrior concept envisioned the radical use of technologies such as nanotechnology, powered exoskeletons, and magnetorheological fluid-based body armor to provide the infantry with significantly higher force multiplier than the opposing force. However, the stated concept was not U.S. Army doctrine, and was not intended to answer every situation that Army After Next (the Army's buzzword for future fighting forces) would face; rather, the concept was meant to serve as an end goal to strive to reach or to compromise with current technologies and to stir imagination and dialogue on how these technologies and concepts could help soldiers in the near future. The first phase of the project involved a development of the technologies to help reduce the soldier's fighting load and power requirements and improving the soldier's protection, lethality, and environmental and situational awareness, with planned deployment in 2010, to serve the Army's short-term needs. The Army's plan was to introduce the subsystems in \\"spirals\\" every two years, instead of one large rollout every ten years. The U.S. military hoped to develop a fully realized end product sometime in 2032, incorporating research from U.C. Berkeley's BLEEX exoskeleton project and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies into a final design. This was one of the most important parts. The Army Combat Shirt was developed from this program. == Basic Features == U.S. Army Rangers of 3rd Battalion 75th Ranger Regiment from the Future Combat Systems, Evaluation Brigade Combat Team, at a live demonstration February 1, 2007 at Fort Bliss, Texas. === Nett Warrior === Nett Warrior - named after Col. Robert B. Nett - replaced Land Warrior. Future Force Warrior was a futuristic research project with real deliverables folded into the Nett Warrior program. Situational awareness including the Rifleman Radio on every soldier, helmet-mounted display (similar to a HUD), location and Physiological Status Monitoring were the basic building blocks being implemented in increment 1. === Headgear Subsystem === The Headgear Subsystem was the situational awareness hub of the system. It was intended to include integrated tactical processing by providing maps, routes, and data with a 180¬∞ emissive visor display, high bandwidth wireless communications, microelectronic/optics combat sensor suite that provides 360¬∞ situational awareness, and integrated small arms protection. === Combat Uniform Subsystem === Described as \\"Survivability Central\\", was intended to contain a trio of layers, \\"the Protective Outer Layer, the Power Centric Layer, and the Life Critical Layer.\\" === Warfighter Physiological Status Monitor Subsystem === WPSM was intended to be an on-board physiological and medical sensor suite that would collect and monitor information regarding vital signs such as body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, hydration and stress levels, sleep status, body positioning and workload capacity of the warrior. If necessary, the WPSM can notify medics and commanders if the soldier has been wounded or has become fatigued. === Microclimate Cooling System === The Microclimate Cooling System, built into the Life Critical Layer, would have been a network of narrow tubing to provide heating or cooling to the soldier, up to 100 watts. === Power Subsystem === The Power Subsystem, built into the Power Centric Layer, would be fed by the Duration Central, a 2 to 20 watt Micro Turbine fueled by a liquid hydrocarbon fuel pack. According to the concept, ten ounces of fuel would power the soldier's integrated electronics ensemble for up to 6 days. Polymeric nanofiber battery patches embedded in the headgear and weapon provide back-up power for three hours. Listed under the Power Vision in the Advanced Technology Demonstrator, the current specifications ask for 24-hour autonomous individual operation and 72-hour continuous autonomous team operations, with a high density, low weight/volume, self-generating/re- generating, reliable, safe power source. == Air Warrior == Air Warrior was the U.S. Army‚Äôs next-generation aircrew ensemble, with the final product intended to provide life support, ballistic protection, and nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) protection in mission-configurable modules, and was under development with interoperability in mind. The system consists of components integrated to maximize safe aircraft operation and sustain aircrews throughout the flight environment. === Block 1 === Block 1 of the Air Warrior system provided an initial system capability including the development, procurement, and fielding of a micro climate cooling system, an integrated survival gear and ballistic protection system, improved over-water protective equipment, and a light-weight chemical and biological protection ensemble. === Block 2 === The ongoing Block 2 technology insertion program provided an Electronic Data Manager and an Aircrew Wireless Intercom System. === Block 3 === General Dynamics C4 Systems was the Block 3 Systems Integrator. The Block 3 system was focused on increasing force effectiveness by improving situational awareness and survivability with features similar to those of the Headgear Subsystem. The Air Warrior Block 3 system was intended to be compatible with multiple helicopter types, including the CH-47 Chinook, OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, AH-64 Apache and UH-60 Blackhawk. Additional Block 3 capabilities were being defined through the requirements analysis and roadmap phase. ==Land Warrior  See also == *Cognitive Technology Threat Warning System, a DARPA project aimed at integrating AI research, and sensory data to create a portable warning-alert system. *Future Soldier 2030 Initiative * MultiCam, the camouflage pattern and clothing used in many FFW examples. * Micropower *Soldier 2025 == References  External links == *Future Force Warrior, defense-update.com *The Future Force Warrior initiative overview at the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Center *Future Force Warrior System, armedforces-int.com *FFW Project Horizon Updates, rangermade.us *HowStuffWorks Article on the Future Warrior Program Category:Proposed weapons of the United States Category:One-piece suits Category:Future soldier programs Category:United States Army projects ","title":"Future Force Warrior"},{"id":"2233142","text":"Phoebe Snow (born Phoebe Ann Laub; July 17, 1950 ‚Äì April 26, 2011) was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist, known for her hit 1975 songs \\"Poetry Man\\" and \\"Harpo's Blues\\" and her credited guest vocals backing Paul Simon on \\"Gone at Last\\".

In the railroad's print ads, a young woman dressed all in white emphasized the cleanliness of Lackawanna passenger trains. (Its locomotives burned anthracite coal, which created less soot than bituminous coal.) == Career == It was at The Bitter End club in 1972 that Denny Cordell, co-owner (with Leon Russell) of Shelter Records, was so taken by the singer that he signed her to the label and produced her first recording. She released an eponymous album, Phoebe Snow, in 1974.

Snow ended up signed to Columbia Records. Her second album, Second Childhood, appeared in 1976, produced by Phil Ramone. It was jazzier and more introspective, and was an RIAA Certified Gold Album for Snow, with the Gold Album awarded on July 9, 1976. She moved to a more rock-oriented sound for It Looks Like Snow, released later in 1976 with David Rubinson producing. 1977 saw Never Letting Go, again with Ramone, while 1978's Against the Grain was helmed by Barry Beckett. After that, Snow parted ways with Columbia; she would later say that the stress of her parental obligations degraded her ability to make music effectively.

It was founded in 1977 by Chris Hornung. The company pioneered the sourcing of bicycles from the Far East for distribution in the U.S., developing relationships with suppliers primarily in Taiwan and China. The company now owns several well known bicycle brands as well as diversifying into bicycle accessories and other types of children's play equipment. Pacific Cycle sells more bicycles than any other company in North America and is one of the most prolific bicycle suppliers in the world. In 2006, Chris Hornung left Pacific Cycle leaving President Jeff Frehner in control. Alice Tillett has been the President of Pacific Cycle since 2008. The company headquarters is located in Madison, Wisconsin, with a corporate branch office in Olney, Illinois (the former home of Roadmaster). They also operate distribution centers in Olney, IL, Vacaville, California and Rancho Cucamonga, California (formerly of PTI). ==History== In 1998, Chris Hornung reached an agreement with Wind Point Partners giving the private equity investment firm a controlling interest in Pacific Cycle. In December 2000, with new resources from the Wind Point Partners deal, Pacific Cycle acquired the bicycle division of Brunswick Corporation for $60 million, obtaining control of the Mongoose and Roadmaster brands. This also gave Pacific Cycle access to Wal-Mart, who was the second largest retailer of bikes and to whom Brunswick was the largest supplier. Mongoose had maintained a strong reputation for quality and performance, particularly among younger, BMX enthusiasts. Pacific Cycle brought Mongoose into the mass-merchant channel at Wal-Mart. In 2001, Pacific Cycle outbid Huffy Corp. in bankruptcy court for the purchase of the Schwinn/GT Corporation, obtaining control of the Schwinn and GT brands for $86 million. In 2002, Schwinn was introduced to the mass-merchant channel at Wal-Mart, Target and Toys \\"R\\" Us. On March 17, 2003, Pacific Cycle acquired InStep L.L.C. for an undisclosed price. InStep is a marketer and distributor of jogging strollers and bicycle trailers. Pacific financed the purchase through company earnings and the price was not disclosed. In 2004, Pacific Cycle was acquired by Dorel Industries from Wind Point Partners for $310 million, acquiring Wind Point's 43 percent stake. Under Dorel's Recreational/Leisure product segment, the Pacific Cycle division (PCG internally) deals with the mass merchant and sporting goods channels while the Cycling Sports Group (CSG) division deals specifically with the Independent Bicycle Dealers (IBD) channel. U.S. distribution channels include mass-market retailers such as Wal- Mart, Target, Kmart, Sears and Toys \\"R\\" Us as well as sporting goods chains such as Dick's Sporting Goods, Academy Sports and Dunham's Sports. Canadian distributors include Canadian Tire. In 2005, Pacific Cycle started importing electric scooters and marketing them under the Schwinn Motor Scooters name. Sales ceased in approximately 2011. In June 2008, Pacific Cycle acquired the assets of PTI Sports LLC (Protective Technologies International), a leading U.S. designer, manufacturer and distributor of bicycle parts, helmets and other accessories, for $28 million. In July 2009, Pacific Cycle acquired the assets of Iron Horse Bicycles and obtained control of the brand. ==Brands== * Caloi * Cannondale * Charge Bikes * DYNO * GT Bicycles * GURU Cycling * InSTEP * Iron Horse Bicycles * Kid Trax * Mongoose * Murray * Pacific * Playsafe * Powerlite * Roadmaster * Schwinn * SUGOI ==References * Category:Companies based in Madison, Wisconsin Category:Cycle manufacturers of the United States Category:American companies established in 1977 Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1977 Category:2004 mergers and acquisitions Category:1998 mergers and acquisitions ","title":"Pacific Cycle"},{"id":"2233158","text":"Piotrk√≥w may refer to the following places in Poland: *Piotrk√≥w Voivodeship, a former administrative division in Poland (1975-1998) *Piotrk√≥w County, an administrative division in Poland *Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski, a city in Piotrk√≥w County (and formerly in Piotrk√≥w Voivodeship), Poland *Piotrk√≥w Kujawski, a city in Gmina Piotrk√≥w Kujawski in Radziej√≥w County, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship *Piotrk√≥w Pierwszy, a village in Gmina Jab≈Çonna in Lublin County, Lublin Voivodeship *Piotrk√≥w Drugi, a village in Gmina Jab≈Çonna *Piotrk√≥w- Kolonia, a village in Gmina Jab≈Çonna ","title":"Piotrk√≥w"},{"id":"2233161","text":"is a Japanese architect who teaches at Keio University SFC.

It belongs to the Walker River Paiute Tribe, a federally recognized tribe of Northern Paiute people. The tribe represents two Northern Paiute bands, the larger Aga'id√∂kad√∂ (Agai Ticutta) (\\"Cutthroat trout Eaters\\") and the smaller Pakwid√∂kad√∂ (Pugwi Ticutta) (\\"Chub carp Eaters\\"). The reservation is located along the Walker River between Yerington and Walker Lake (in Northern Paiute: Hagi).Northern Paiute Language Project At the current lake level, the reservation has only a small frontage on Walker Lake. The bulk of the reservation (72.68%) is in Mineral County; with portions in Lyon County (14.37%) and Churchill County (12.95%). The reservation's land area is 529.970 square miles (1,372.616 km¬≤). In the 2000 census, it had a resident population of 853 persons, and 746 persons in 2010. Schurz is the only town on the reservation. Wovoka, creator of the Ghost Dance important in the 19th century, is buried in Schurz. Weber Reservoir, an impoundment of the Walker River, is located upstream of Schurz and provides irrigation water for farms on the reservation. Given the environmental conditions, most of the reservation is used for cattle range. The Walker River Paiute joined together with the Pyramid Lake Paiute tribe (two Northern Paiute bands: Kuyuid√∂kad√∂ (Cui Yui Ticutta): \\"Cui-ui-Fish-Eaters\\", and Tasiget tuviwarai: \\"Those who live amidst the mountains\\") in a 2016 civil rights suit in federal court against the state to secure polling places on their reservations. Otherwise members had to travel excessive miles to reach a polling place. Early voting for the 2016 elections at Walker River reservation started October 22, and during the first two days, turnout nearly equaled the total of all voters in the 2012 presidential election.Stephanie Woodard, \\"Paiutes Triumph in Court‚ÄîEarly Voting ‚ÄòIn Full Swing‚Äô on Two Reservations\\", Indian Country Today, 27 October 2016; accessed 27 October 2016 ==Political activism== Native Americans in Nevada have become more politically active in presidential and other elections, as have those in other states. As part of that, they have been seeking more equitable access to polling places and treatment by county and state officials. Led by chairman Vinton Hawley of the Pyramid Lake Paiute, the Walker River Paiute joined in a successful civil rights suit in federal court against the state government to gain polling places on their homelands in 2016. They have had a discriminatory burden in the past by having to travel excessive distances to vote in elections. Walker River voters were enthusiastic after the victory, with early voting in the first two days on the reservation equal to the total votes cast by members of the tribe in the 2012 presidential election. Hawley is chairman of the Inter- Tribal Council of Nevada. Many of their members have similar difficulties with access to polling places. On behalf of the Council, Hawley has \\"urged Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske to direct counties to open [homeland] polling places for nine more tribes, including some where ballot boxes are 200-plus miles away, round trip.\\" He also urged the Secretary of State for Nevada to improve conditions at local county polling places for urban Indians, who testified in the suit to being made uncomfortable at most offices. ==Notes== *Walker River Reservation, Nevada United States Census Bureau ==References * Official Website of the Walker River Paiute Tribe Category:Paiute Category:American Indian reservations in Nevada Category:Federally recognized tribes in the United States Category:Native American tribes in Nevada Category:Populated places in Churchill County, Nevada Category:Populated places in Lyon County, Nevada Category:Populated places in Mineral County, Nevada ","title":"Walker River Indian Reservation"},{"id":"2233182","text":"Yu So-chow (; 9 July 1930 ‚Äì 12 May 2017) was a Chinese actress. She was born in Beijing to a Peking opera family. She is the daughter of late Master Yu Jim Yuen who ran the China Drama Academy, a Peking Opera School in Hong Kong, and teacher of many well-known actors. She started her acting career in 1948 and made over 240 films in the wuxia, kung fu, action, detective and Cantonese opera genres. Her films were successful at the box-office and she was one of the most popular superstars of the 1960 in Asia and Hong Kong. ==Career== Yu learned Peking Opera at the age of eight and made her stage debut at the age of nine. She specialized in playing female warrior roles in which she could skillfully demonstrate her footwork by continuously juggling and kicking back twelve red-tasselled tuo shou (ËÑ´Êâã) spears, as seen in one of her famous stage Peking operas, The White Snake (ÁôΩËõáÂÇ≥), and in the 1951 film Amazon on the Sea (Êµ∑‰∏äÂ•≥Èú∏Áéã). Her first movie was made in 1948. She was one of the three actresses in the 1950s who really knew martial arts. Off the screen, she was virtually a heroine: at the age of sixteen, she alone successfully fought off a group of gangsters with only a silky belt on the streets of Shanghai. Her early wuxia pictures from 1948-57 were in both Mandarin and Cantonese dialogue, with stories intended to increase cooperation of the Northern Style and Southern Style of martial arts, as seen in The heroine of deadly darts (Â•≥‰ø†ÈüøÂ∞æËøΩÈ≠ÇÈè¢) in 1956. These remarkable wuxia films were mostly based on kung fu novels, e.g. Burning of the Red Lotus Monastery Pt 1 & Pt 2 (ÁÅ´ÁáíÁ¥ÖËìÆÂØ∫) in 1950, The Golden Hairpin Pt 1 & Pt 3 (Á¢ßË°ÄÈáëÈáµ) in 1963, Buddha‚Äôs Palm (Â¶Ç‰æÜÁ•ûÊéå), a four-part film, in 1964 and The Burning of Pingyang City (ÁÅ´ÁáíÂπ≥ÈôΩÂüé) in 1965. Her performances in Cantonese opera were quite different; she brought in a mixture of Peking Opera, in which she performed a lot of footwork, as in Suet Ting Shan and Fan Lai Hua - Meeting on the Weedy River (ËòÜËä±Ê≤≥ÊúÉÊØç) in 1961, Giving birth on the bridge ‚Äì the White serpent (Êñ∑Ê©ãÁî¢Â≠ê) in 1962 and How Zhong Wuyan Conquered the West (ÈçæÁÑ°Ëâ∑ÊéõÂ∏•ÂæÅË•ø) in 1962. She also played a male lead as seen in movies Execution of Lui Po at Pak Moon Lau (ÁôΩÈñÄÊ®ìÊñ¨ÂëÇÂ∏É) in 1961, Two hunters in a pursuit (ÊñáÊ≠¶ÁãÄÂÖÉÁà≠ÂΩ©È≥≥) in 1962 and The beauties (Èô£Èô£Áæé‰∫∫Â®Å) in 1964. Apart from action films, she did a few rare contemporary and melodrama films, for example Midsummer night‚Äôs romance (Â§èÂ§ú‰πãÊàÄ) in 1953, Bachelors beware (Ê∫´ÊüîÈÑâ) in 1960 and Two mouthy ladies from the north and south (ÂçóÂåóÈêµÂíÄÈõû) in 1965. Her golden age of filming was between 1963 and 1966, when she made at least thirty movies in a year. Her surprise roles in The big revenge part 1 and 2 (ÁÅïÊ±üÊ≤≥ÁïîË°ÄÊµ∑‰ªá) (1963) and Heaven, Hell and Crystal Palace (Â§©Â†ÇÂú∞ÁçÑÊ∞¥Êô∂ÂÆÆ) (1965) did not destroy her popularity nor upset her fans; instead they won the hearts of the audience. Her last major movie was filmed in Taiwan (Decree of the fire dragon (Ë°ÄÁÅ´Èæç‰ª§) in 1968) and she made a guest appearance in Secret agent no.1 (Á•ûÊé¢‰∏ÄËôü) in 1970. In 2004, Yu was one of the celebrities honoured on the Avenue of Stars, Hong Kong. To date, Yu still holds the record among actresses of making more than 170 wuxia movies. ==Personal life== Yu ended her acting career after she married, in 1966, Mak Bing-wing (; 1915‚Äì1984), a Chinese actor active in Cantonese opera. Mak Bing- wing began his acting career in the 1930s. He left Hong Kong in 1941 for a tour of the United States, returning in 1947 after the Pacific War had ended. While in the United States, Mak appeared in numerous Grandview Film Company productions. Yu So-chow was his second wife. They had three children and later moved to the United States, where she died of pneumonia on 12 May 2017 in San Francisco, California, aged 86. ==Selected filmography== *The revenge of the great swordsman Assassin Zhang Wenxiang (Â§ß‰ø†Âæ©‰ªáË®ò) (1949) *The five heroes'deadly spears (‰∫îËôéÊñ∑È≠ÇÊßç) (1951) *A story of three lovers, pt 1 & 2 (ÂïºÁ¨ëÂßªÁ∑£‰∏ä‰∏ãÈõÜ) (1952) *A heroine from Mount Emei(Â≥®ÂµãÂ•≥‰ø† ) (1952) *The dragon-phoenix swordsmen(ÈæçÈ≥≥ÈõôÂäç‰ø†) (1957) *The strange hero conquered the dragon(ÊÄ™‰ø†Ëµ§Â±†Èæç) (1960) *Conqueress(ÁÑ°ÊïµÊ•äÂÆ∂Â∞á) (1961) *The secret book, part one (‰ªôÈ∂¥Á•ûÈáù‰∏ä‰∏ã‰∏âÈõÜ) (1961) *The village militia, pt 1 & 2 (È≠îÈè°Á•ûÁè†‰∏ä‰∏ãÈõÜ) (1962) *The blonde hair monster(ÈªÉÊØõÊÄ™‰∫∫) (1962) *The birth of the Monkey King(È¶¨È®ÆÁ≤æÂá∫‰∏ñ) (1962) *The Road to the west(Âîê‰∏âËóèÂèñË•øÁ∂ì) (1962) *Ingentious swords, pt 1 & 2 (ÁôΩÈ™®Èô∞ÈôΩÂäç‰∏ä‰∏ãÈõÜ) (1962) *Burning of the Red Lotus Monastery pt 1 & 2 (ÁÅ´ÁáíÁ¥ÖËìÆÂØ∫‰∏ä‰∏ãÈõÜ) (1963) *Valiant Pan An (Ê≠¶ÊΩòÂÆâ) (1963) *The iron wild goose pt 1 & 2(ÈêµÈõÅÈúúÁøé‰∏ä‰∏ãÈõÜ) (1963) *The tiger in hunting(Ëá•ËôéËóèÈæç) (1963) *Pat cham lau lan sai pat wan (‰∏çÊñ¨Ê®ìËò≠Ë™ì‰∏çÈÇÑ) (1963) *Spring blossoms(Ëä±ÈñãÂØåË≤¥Èå¶ÂüéÊò•) (1964) *The Flying Fox(Ëê¨ËÆäÈ£õÁãê) (1964) *The invincible kid Fang Shiyu(ÁÑ°ÊïµÁ•ûÁ´•Êñπ‰∏ñÁéâ) (1965) *The all-powerful flute pt 1 & 2(Á∞´ËÅ≤ÈúáÊ≠¶Êûó‰∏ä‰∏ãÈõÜ) (1965) *Hero of midland(‰∏≠ÂéüÂ•á‰ø†) (1966) *Fire dragon and the mythical pearl(ÁÅ´ÈæçÁ•ûÁè†) (1966) *Heroic days of the Great Ming Dynasty (Êñ∑ËáÇÁ•ûÈæçÂäç) (1966) *The avengers' tale pt 1 & 2 (ÈêµË°ÄÊÅ©‰ªáÈåÑ‰∏ä‰∏ãÈõÜ) (1966) ==References *Official website *Iconic Heroines in Cantonese Opera Films *Yu So Chau at Hong Kong Cinemagic * * as Suqiu Yu * as So-Chow Yu Category:1930 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Hong Kong film actresses Category:Peking opera actresses Category:Singers from Beijing Category:Chinese film actresses Category:Actresses from Beijing Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Infectious disease deaths in California Category:Actresses from San Francisco Category:American people of Northern Han Chinese descent ","title":"Yu So-chow"},{"id":"2233216","text":"Rami Jaffee (born March 11, 1969) is an American musician who is the keyboardist for Foo Fighters. He has worked with many artists including The Wallflowers, Pete Yorn, Soul Asylum, Stone Sour, Joseph Arthur and Coheed and Cambria. == Early life == Jaffee was born on March 11, 1969, in Los Angeles. When he was 13, he purchased a keyboard and was soon playing with local bands. After graduating from Fairfax High School, he continued to play in various bands, and he took session work in recording studios. ==Career== Around 1989, Jakob Dylan and his friend Tobi Miller formed a group called the Apples, playing various clubs in the L.A. area. While waiting in line at Canter's deli after 2:00 am, Jaffee heard the Apples wanted an organist/pianist, and he was told that Dylan and Miller were then in the Kibitz Room bar attached to Canter's. They met; Dylan and Miller played Jaffee some demo tapes in their car stereo, and Jaffee immediately joined the group. A few weeks later, they changed their name to the Wallflowers and signed with Virgin Records. In 1992, they released their first album, The Wallflowers. The Wallflowers toured throughout the U.S. and Canada in 1992 and early 1993. They served as the opening act for Cracker, the Spin Doctors and 10,000 Maniacs, and they started headlining their own shows. Virgin appeared to lose interest in the Wallflowers because of poor album sales. The band's two familiar label representatives left the label, after which the record company tried to use the Dylan name as a selling point, against the band's directive. In mid-1993, the label released the band from their contract. Other labels were not interested in signing the band, and Jaffee filled his time by playing gigs with El Vez as well as taking more session work. He kept his interest in the Wallflowers, saying later, \\"I believe in these songs, and I'm here for the duration because no one is writing songs like these anymore, songs that have room for a Hammond organ and me.\\" The Wallflowers signed to Interscope Records in 1994. While working with T Bone Burnett, who was producing the band's next album, Jaffee was frequently called in as a session musician for producers Paul Fox, Matt Hyde and Rick Neigher. Because of this, in 1996 he was credited on albums by Rickie Lee Jones, the Hookers, Leah Andreone and Chalk FarM. At the same time, the Wallflowers released their second album, Bringing Down the Horse, which went quadruple Platinum. The band toured in support of the album, but in 1997, Jaffee and his wife had a daughter, and he left the tour to be with his family for two months. That same year, he performed session work with Everclear, Grant Lee Buffalo, Richie Sambora, Macy Gray, Jeremy Toback, Joe Henry, Melissa Etheridge, Ramsay Midwood and Garth Brooks. The Wallflowers received a Grammy nomination in 1998 for \\"Heroes\\" which appeared in the film Godzilla. In late 2000, the band released Breach. The band headlined their own tour for a year but also opened for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, the Who and John Mellencamp. Following this, the Wallflowers released Red Letter Days, touring again during 2002‚Äì2003. With a new drummer, the band released Rebel, Sweetheart, their fifth album, on May 24, 2005. The Wallflowers toured to promote the album, but Jaffee disagreed with the band, and he abandoned the tour with three dates remaining. In 2005, Jaffee began collaborating with Foo Fighters. He was made an official member in 2017. Jaffee led the house band on The Fran Drescher Show and, as of 2010, co-owned a recording studio called Fonogenic Studios in the San Fernando Valley. In 2012 and 2013, Jaffee was a member of the Sound City Players, a supergroup formed by Dave Grohl that, in addition to appearing in Grohl's 2013 documentary, Sound City, played a limited number of tour dates in 2013. The Sound City Players consisted of a rotating number of artists including Grohl, Jaffee, Stevie Nicks, Alain Johannes, Paul McCartney, Rick Springfield, Josh Homme, Trent Reznor, Krist Novoselic and more. In 2012, Jaffee returned to the Wallflowers, who were coming off a long hiatus. They released the album Glad All Over in 2012 and toured in support of it that year and also in 2013. Jaffee then left the band again. ==Personal life== He dated Daryl Hannah in 2012. == Discography (excerpt) == {  ! Year ! Group ! Title ! Label !

It works in conjunction with a screen-based telephone (\\"screenphone\\") or other compatible customer-premises equipment (CPE) to provide the user with softkey access to telephone company or internal PBX custom calling features. It is an analog service because it uses analog frequency-shift keying (FSK) technology to interact with an LCD screen via short, low-baud rate, downloads to refresh and re-program softkeys in real- time. The technology introduced in the United States and rolled out to Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) from Bellcore in April 1995, (very soon after the introduction of CLASS-based services through electronic switching system (ESS)), was marketed by the RBOCs who implemented it, as a way to streamline all available custom calling options through the use of a screen-based telephone; giving Residential and Small Business telephone subscribers PBX-like functionality at home or in small office/home office (SOHO) locations at a significantly lower cost. The service debuted before the onslaught of Personal Communications Service (PCS) and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)-based telephony technologies became available and was originally slated to also work in conjunction with other types of services such as Enhanced Directory Assistance, telephone banking, movie theatre ticket sales, and other services that could interact with an LCD-screen. Some of those services did become available later, though, not at the dramatic increase the US-based telephone companies had hoped. Canadian telephone companies such as Telus and Bell Canada, however, had much better luck implementing more ADSI-based services with other industries such as banking, and were still marketing the service actively as of 2005. The service is marketed at telephone customers who subscribe to the majority of Custom Local Area Signaling Services (CLASS)-based services offered by their local telephone company (such as caller ID, Call Return, etc.) by the customization of a telephone capable of providing one-touch access to these features. This greatly increases customer usability by alleviating the need to memorize dialing codes such as *69. Additionally, a few RBOCs introduced new features such as Call Waiting Deluxe and Message Waiting Indicator to work exclusively with ADSI telephones. The former being perhaps the most involved example of ADSI capabilities and the latter being an example of Visual FSK; another new technology available through CLASS. The RBOCs who offer this service also restructured their billing of these services into value-based \\"packages\\" to stimulate customer interest. ==Compatible equipment== U S West Communications, the first local RBOC to offer this service, marketed it as \\"Home Receptionist\\" service. Home Receptionist service included a Nortel Powertouch (or Vista) 350 screen-based telephone and \\"line-provisioning\\" service to make it work. This service is still offered by Qwest Communications (the successor to US West), BellSouth and SBC Communications; though the service has different marketing names. Nortel discontinued the x5x telephone line and introduced a more streamlined version called the 39x-line and then later the 48x-line in 1998. CIDCo and Cybiotronics later introduced their own lines of screenphones after the original Nortel Patent expired. Nortel sold off its CPE line to Aastra Technologies in 1999 and Aastra continues to market these telephones through various channels. P100 Screenphone (Swedish version) Philips Austria manufactured a Screen Phone model called the P100. It was sold throughout the US and several European countries. ==External links== *ADSI Technical Information by Telcordia *Aastra Telecom * ETSI ADSI Data link message and parameter codings Category:Telephony signals ","title":"Analog Display Services Interface"},{"id":"2233223","text":"Accelerando is a 2005 science fiction novel consisting of a series of interconnected short stories written by British author Charles Stross. As well as normal hardback and paperback editions, it was released as a free e-book under the CC BY-NC-ND license. Accelerando won the Locus Award in 2006, and was nominated for several other awards in 2005 and 2006, including the Hugo, Campbell, Clarke, and British Science Fiction Association Awards. ==Title== In Italian, accelerando means \\"speeding up\\" and is used as a tempo marking in musical notation. In Stross' novel, it refers to the accelerating rate at which humanity in general, and/or the novel's characters, head towards the technological singularity. ==Plot introduction== The book is a collection of nine short stories telling the tale of three generations of a family before, during, and after a technological singularity. It was originally written as a series of novelettes and novellas, all published in Asimov's Science Fiction magazine in the period 2001 to 2004. According to Stross, the initial inspiration for the stories was his experience working as a programmer for a high-growth company during the dot-com boom of the 1990s.Charles Stross, On beginnings ..., Charlie's Diary, 10 June 2005. The first three stories follow the character of agalmic \\"venture altruist\\" Manfred Macx, starting in the early 21st century; the second three stories follow his daughter Amber; and the final three focus largely on Amber's son Sirhan in the completely transformed world at the end of the century. ==Plot concepts== Stross describes humanity's situation at the start of Accelerando as dire: > In the background of what looks like a Panglossian techno-optimist novel, > horrible things are happening. Most of humanity is wiped out, then > arbitrarily resurrected in mutilated form by the Vile Offspring.

As events progress in Accelerando, the planets of the solar system are dismantled over time to form a Matrioshka brain, a vast solar-powered computational device inhabited by minds inconceivably more advanced and complex than naturally evolved intelligences such as human beings. This proves to be a normal stage in the life-cycle of an inhabited solar system; the galaxies are revealed to be filled with such Matrioshka brains. Intelligent consciousnesses outside of Matrioshka brains may communicate via wormhole networks. The notion that the universe is dominated by a communications network of superintelligences bears comparison with Olaf Stapledon's 1937 science-fiction novel Star Maker, although Stapledon's advanced civilisations are said to communicate psychically rather than informatically. ==Characters== *Manfred Macx: Venture altruist, protagonist of the early stories. *Aineko: Manfred's robotic, increasingly intelligent cat. *The Lobsters: Sentient nervous-system state vectors originating from Panulirus interruptus, the California spiny lobster. *Bob Franklin: Billionaire investor; originator of the Franklin Collective, a \\"borganism\\" composed of multiple bodies sharing the same mind. *Annette Dimarcos: Arianespace employee; Manfred's second wife. *Pamela: Manfred's partner, later first wife. *Gianni Vittoria: Former Italian Minister for Economic Affairs, sometime Minister for Transhuman Affairs, economic theoretician. *Amber Macx: Manfred and Pamela's daughter. *Dr. Sadeq Khurasani: Muslim imam, engineer, Field Circus crewman. *The Wunch: Predatory alien virtual constructs embedded in the wormhole router orbiting Hyundai. *The Slug: Sentient alien corporation/economy/419 scam from the router. *Sirhan al-Khurasani: Son of Amber and Sadeq's physical versions. *Vile Offspring: Derogatory term for the posthuman \\"weakly godlike intelligences\\" that inhabit the inner solar system by the novel's end. ==Plot summary and breakdown by story== In the following table, the chapter number (#), chapter name & original magazine date of publication, and a brief synopsis are given. The nine stories are grouped into three parts. { style=\\"margin:auto;\\"  - !# !Chapter/Date of original publication !Part 1 : Slow Takeoff ‚Äì Synopsis - 1 \\"Lobsters\\" June 2001 In early-21st-century Amsterdam, Manfred receives a call on a courier-delivered phone from entities claiming to be a net-based AI working for KGB .ru, seeking his help on how to defect. Eventually, he discovers the callers are actually uploaded brain-scans of the California spiny lobster looking to escape from humanity's interference. Driven by his commitment to agalmic economics, he manages to team them up with entrepreneur Bob Franklin, who is looking for an AI to crew his nascent spacefaring project‚Äîthe building of a self-replicating factory complex from cometary material. A legal precedent is established that will help define the rights of future AIs and uploaded minds. Later, Manfred's predatory fianc√©e Pamela forces him to impregnate and marry her in an attempt to control him. - 2 \\"Troubadour\\" October 2001 Three years later, Manfred is in the throes of an acrimonious divorce, and has a daughter from his marriage to Pamela, frozen as a newly fertilised embryo. He meets Annette again, and begins a relationship with her. Three schemes‚Äîa workable state centralised planning apparatus that can interface with external market systems, a way to upload the entirety of the 20th century's out-of-copyright film and music to the net, and a plan to thwart his grasping wife and her lawyers‚Äîcome together perfectly. Amber, Manfred's daughter, has been defrosted and born, and is being brought up by Pamela. - 3 \\"Tourist\\" February 2002 In Edinburgh, five years later, Manfred is mugged and his memories (stored in cyberware) are stolen, forcing him to rediscover who he is and what he's doing in Edinburgh. Meanwhile, the Lobsters are thriving in colonies situated at the L5 point, and on a comet in the asteroid belt; they, along with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the ESA, have picked up encrypted signals from outside the solar system. Bob Franklin, now dead, is personality- reconstructed in the Franklin Collective. Manfred, his memories recovered, moves to further expand the rights of non-human intelligences. Aineko begins its own study‚Äîand decoding‚Äîof the alien signals. - !# !Chapter !Part 2 : Point of Inflection ‚Äì Synopsis - 4 \\"Halo\\" June 2002 A decade later, Amber Macx ‚Äînow in her early teens‚Äî finally breaks free from her domineering mother by utilising a complex plot, thought up by Manfred and Annette, in which she enslaves herself via a Yemeni shell corporation and later enlists aboard a Franklin Collective-owned, youth-crewed spacecraft, mining materials from Amalthea, Jupiter's third moon. Pamela petitions the imam Sadeq to issue an Islamic legal judgment against Amber, which she thwarts by setting up her own empire on a small, privately owned asteroid, thus making herself sovereign. In the meantime, the alien signals have been decoded, and a physical journey to a mentioned \\"router\\" is planned. - 5 \\"Router\\" September 2002 The alien router, orbiting a 3-light-year-distant brown dwarf star named Hyundai +4904/-56, is visited by the spacecraft Field Circus, a Coke-can-sized mass of computronium propelled by a Jupiter-based laser and a lightsail. Amber and 62 others have uploaded themselves to become the virtualised crew. They are contacted by a group of aliens called \\"The Wunch\\", who occupy virtual bodies based on Lobster patterns \\"borrowed\\" from Manfred's original transmissions. The Wunch turn out to be thieving, third-rate \\"barbarians\\" who, after a struggle, are thwarted. Amber and a few others make the decision to travel deep into the router's wormhole network. - 6 \\"Nightfall\\" April 2003 The router explorers find themselves trapped by yet more malign aliens in a variety of virtual spaces, but are eventually set free by Aineko's machinations. They discover that they are being hosted in a Matrioshka brain, the builders of which seem to have disappeared (or been destroyed by their own creations), leaving an anarchy ruled by sentient, viral corporations and scavengers who attempt to use newcomers as currency. The crew finally escape by offering passage to a \\"rogue alien corporation\\" (a \\"pyramid scheme crossed with a 419 scam\\"), virtualised as a giant slug, who opens a powered route out. Thereafter, the crew begins the journey back home. - !# !Chapter !Part 3 : Singularity ‚Äì Synopsis - 7 \\"Curator\\" December 2003 Back in Earth's solar system, the crew find that \\"home\\" is now Saturn, on a floating habitat in the planet's upper atmosphere, where they meet Sirhan, son of the physical Amber and Sadeq, who both stayed (and died) at home. The crew upload their virtual states into new bodies, and find that they are all now bankrupt, unable to compete with the new Economics 2.0 model practised by the posthuman intelligences of the inner system. Manfred, Pamela, and Annette are present in various forms. Bailiffs‚Äîsentient enforcement constructs‚Äîarrive to \\"repossess\\" Amber and Aineko, but a scheme is hatched whereby the Slug is introduced to Economics 2.0, which keeps both constructs very busy. - 8 \\"Elector\\" September 2004 In the increasingly populated Saturnian floating cities, Amber, Annette, Gianni and Manfred begin a political campaign to finance a scheme to escape the predations of the \\"Vile Offspring\\" by journeying once more to the router network, with Amber as the leader of the \\"Accelerationista\\" party. She loses the election (to the stay-at-home \\"conservationista\\" faction), but once more the Lobsters step in to help, by offering passage to uploads on their large ships if the humans agree to act as explorers and mappers. - 9 \\"Survivor\\" October 2004 In the centuries following the singularity, the router has, once again, been reached. Learning from it, the refugees have created their own network, enabling them to explore vast distances. Habitats built around Hyundai are home to copies that wish to stay put, including child-clones. Aineko returns to make Manfred an offer that, if he accepts it, will result in Aineko leaving them alone forever. } ==Allusions/references to contemporary science== The novel contains numerous allusions to real-world scientific concepts and individuals, including: * The lobster stomatogastric ganglion (STG) * Rubberized concrete * The Fermi paradox: Stross offers a solution to the paradox, claiming that the apparent lack of intelligent life in the universe is an illusion created by a shortage of bandwidth (see information theory). * The Menger sponge * The Austrian roboticist and futurist Hans Moravec, who is mentioned numerous times * Quantum state vectors * The nanoassembly conformational problem * Langford Fractals, or basilisks * Ken Thompson's compiler hack * Penrose tiling * A Dyson sphere and its variants * Aerogel ==Awards and nominations== Accelerando won the 2006 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, and the 2010 Estonian SF Award for Best Translated Novel of 2009.I get mail, from Stross's blog, posted 2 November 2010.

The main purpose of the newspaper was to oppose the Vietnam war.About this newspaper: Independent Eye, Chronicling America, Library of Congress, retrieved August 30, 2010. The first four monthly issues were mimeographed pamphlets, and in June 1968 it became a broadsheet.\\"The Alternative Press Used to Be Considered Dangerous\\" by Lew Moores. CityBeat, April 7, 2004. Retrieved August 30, 2010. HQ moved to Cincinnati in January 1969. First a monthly, later a biweekly, eventually a monthly (following an arson fire on Labor Day, 1970), it carried News of the war and of the war resistance movement. There were also some stories about the people and events of Cincinnati, Ohio and the surrounding area. During the heyday of the Eye, as its devotees called it, leadership duties were shared by Alex Varrone, Jennifer Varrone, Monty Sher and Ellen Bierhorst Sher. Alex was founding editor and business manager; Monty helped with initial community organizing support. Ellen managed the make up and lay out team out of the Sher's home in Clifton, the Lloydhouse. Frankie Gerson, later the founder of Cincinnati's Free Store, was the star newspaper peddler, selling more copies than anyone else on the streets Downtown. The paper featured cartoon art by Ted Richards. The staff split and several members formed the Queen City Express, a newspaper that focused on younger readers. The schism in the staff had to do with the issue of violence in the peace movement. One faction, led by Ted Richards, advocated that the paper call for \\"off the pigs\\" ‚Äì in other words vilification of all law enforcement personnel. Horrified by this position, the Shers withdrew from participation in about 1971. The paper then moved to an apartment on Vine Street just south of McMillan. After the Shers and, later, the Varrones had withdrawn, Michael Wood (brother of Northside Community leaders Maureen and Peggy Wood) took over leadership in the 70's. Regular publication halted in 1974‚Äì1975. The Independent Eye began publication once again in 2005. Ellen Bierhorst Sher donated a complete archive of the early years to the public library sometime in the 1990s. A retrospective exhibition of the Independent Eye was held at the main branch of the Public Library of Cincinnati in November, 2019. A filmed panel discussion featured local artist Mark Neeley (who researched and curated the project), Ellen Bierhorst, Monty Sher, and Jim Tarbell. Around a dozen original Eye staff members and artists attended the event, including photographer Melvin Grier. Additionally, Neeley and the Public Library digitized the entire archive of Eye papers via their website's digital library. An Eye tribute publication titled Optic: a Visual Tribute to the Independent Eye was subsequently published, featuring 14 local artists paying tribute the original newspaper. Made possible by the Haile Foundation, copies of Optic were distributed at a variety of local business and museums. https://www.citybeat.com/arts- culture/culture/article/21094548/the-independent-eye-a-look-back-at- cincinnatis-1960s70s-underground-counterculture-newspaper ==References== Category:Newspapers published in Ohio Category:Underground culture Category:Greene County, Ohio Category:Buildings and structures in the United States destroyed by arson Category:Arson in Ohio ","title":"Independent Eye"},{"id":"2233246","text":"The Westerdijk Institute, or Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute, is part of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. The institute was renamed on 10 February 2017, after Johanna Westerdijk, the first female professor in the Netherlands and director of the institute from 1907 to 1958. The former name of the institute was CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre or Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (Central Bureau of Fungal Cultures in English). Despite the name change the collection maintained by the institute remains the CBS collections and the use of CBS numbers for the strains continues. The Institute is located in a science park in de Uithof, a suburb of Utrecht. Before it had been located between offices at the university in Delft and in Baarn. CBS was established in 1904 as a collection of living fungi and algae at the Eleventh International Botanical Congress in Vienna. Since 2002 has been director of CBS as the successor of Dirk van der Mei. Since its inception the Institute has built one of the world's largest collections of fungi, yeasts and bacteria. The collection serves as an International standard for microbiologists, ecologists and geneticists. The institute is roughly divided into two parts: Collection Management and Research. Researchers carry out investigations in taxonomy (biology) and evolutionary biology of fungi, ecological and genomic issues are often involved. The institute also acts as a centre of expertise for questions related to fungi, yeasts and bacteria from scientists, business, government and the public. The institute also organises courses in general mycology, medical mycology, mycology relating to food and to the built environment. The CBS collection has been recognised as a repository of proprietary molds, yeasts and bacteria. The Institute carries out identifications of microorganisms for third parties and advises on problems caused by fungi and yeasts. Presently there are 6 research groups:Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute * Evolutionary Phytopathology (Pedro Crous) * Applied and Industrial Mycology (Jos Houbraken) * Medical Mycology (Sybren de Hoog) * Yeast and Basidiomycete Research (Teun Boekhout) * Fungal Physiology (Ronald de Vries) * Bioinformatics (Vincent Robert) The Westerdijk Institute is responsible for the mycological journal Studies in Mycology.:nl:Studies in Mycology Studies in Mycology (nl) In collaboration with the National Herbarium of the Netherlands the mycological journal Persoonia is produced.

It was originally claimed that the book was written by a Tibetan monk named Lobsang Rampa. On investigation the author was found to be one Cyril Henry Hoskin (1910‚Äì1981), the son of a British plumber, who claimed that his body was occupied by the spirit of a Tibetan monk named Tuesday Lobsang Rampa. The book is considered a hoax.Yapp, Nick. (1993). Hoaxers and Their Victims. Robson. pp. 140-166. Dodin, Thierry. (1996). Imagining Tibet: Perceptions, Projections, and Fantasies. Wisdom Publications. pp. 196-200. ==Plot== The story of The Third Eye begins in Tibet during the reign of the 13th Dalai Lama. Tuesday Lobsang Rampa, the son of a Lhasa aristocrat, takes up theological studies and is soon recognised for his prodigious abilities. As he enters adolescence, the young Rampa undertakes increasingly challenging feats until he is recognised as a crucial asset to the future of an independent Tibet. Tibet's Lamas had foretold a future in which China would attempt to reassert its authority, and Rampa is operated upon to help him preserve his country. A third eye is drilled into his forehead, allowing him to see human auras and to determine people's hidden motivations. With his third eye, Rampa can serve as an aide in the Dalai Lama's court and spy on visitors to the court as they are being received. The visitors upon whom Rampa spies include the scholar Sir Charles Alfred Bell, deemed by Rampa as naive but benevolent. In contrast, Rampa and others are certain that Chinese visitors are nefarious and are soon to attempt to bring conquest and destruction to Tibet. Tibet must then prepare for an invasion. During the story, Rampa meets yetis, and at the end of the book he encounters a mummified body that was him in an earlier incarnation. He also takes part in an initiation ceremony in which he learns that during its early history the planet Earth was struck by another planet, causing Tibet to become the mountain kingdom that it is today. The popularity of the book led to two sequels, The Doctor from Lhasa and The Rampa Story, and Lobsang Rampa wrote twenty books in all. ==Controversy== Although it is claimed by the author to be an authentic autobiography of Rampa's education as a monk born in Tibet, the book's emphasis on the occult made scholars doubtful about its origins. The book includes a description of a surgical operation similar to trepanation in which a third eye is drilled into the forehead of Rampa, allegedly in order to enhance his psychic powers. After the book became a bestseller, selling 500,000 copies in its first two years, Heinrich Harrer, explorer and Tibetologist, hired the private detective Clifford Burgess to investigate the background of the author.Tibballs, Geoff. (2006). The World's Greatest Hoaxes. Barnes & Noble. pp. 27-29. \\"A number of Tibetan scholars, including explorer Heinrich Harrer who had personally tutored the Dalai Lama, remained convinced that the book was pure fiction, containing, as it did, certain statements inconsistent with Buddhist beliefs. So they hired private detective Clifford Burgess to delve into the background of Tuesday Lobsang Rampa. What Burgess came up with was Cyril Hoskins, a man who had never been anywhere near Tibet, had no real knowledge of the country's language or indeed of Buddhism and had certainly never had a hole drilled in his forehead. Any expertise had been gleaned from reading books in London libraries.\\" In February 1958 the results of the investigation were published in the Daily Mail. The author of the book turned out to be a man named Cyril Henry Hoskin, who came from Plympton in Devon and was the son of a plumber. Hoskin had never been to Tibet and spoke no Tibetan. When interviewed by the British press, Hoskin (who had legally changed his name to Carl Kuon So in 1948) admitted that he had written the book. He claimed in his 1960 book The Rampa Story that his body had been taken over by the Tibetan monk's spirit after falling out of an apple tree in the garden of his home. Hoskin always maintained that his books were true stories and denied any suggestions of a hoax. ==Responses== Although detractors regard the book as a myth of Cyril Hoskin's own creation, The Third Eye and its sequels remain the most popular publications claiming to represent life in Tibet. The dismissal of the book as a fabrication by scholars did not undermine its popularity, despite the lack of records of Rampa ever having lived and its depiction of events that are not found in the standard literature describing life in a Tibetan monastery. Writing in The Observer in May 2020, David Bramwell noted, \\"History should not judge Rampa, who died in 1981, too harshly. Many leading Tibetologists admit that he set them on their paths, and the Dalai Lama has acknowledged Rampa‚Äôs role in drawing attention to the plight of his country.\\" Gordon Stein in Encyclopedia of Hoaxes (1993) has written: == References == * Lopez, Donald S., Jr. Prisoners of Shangri-LA : Tibetan Buddhism and the West,' , discusses the influence of The Third Eye' on the Western interest in Buddhism. * Boese, Alex. \\"The Third Eye\\".

The XP-72 was designed around the Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major 28-cylinder air-cooled radial engine with a supercharger mounted behind the pilot and driven by an extension shaft from the engine. The armament consisted of six 50 caliber wing-mounted machine guns and underwing racks for two 1,000 lb bombs. ==Design and development== The XP-72 development paralleled that of another Republic design, the XP-69 that was to be powered by an experimental 42-cylinder Wright R-2160 liquid-cooled inline radial engine mounted in the nose of the aircraft and driving contra-rotating propellers. The XP-69 was intended for high altitude operations and featured a pressurized cockpit and armament of two 37 mm cannon and four 50 caliber machine guns. As the XP-72 displayed greater promise than the XP-69, the XP-69 was cancelled on 11 May 1943 and an order for two XP-72 prototypes was placed on 18 June 1943. ==Operational history== The XP-72 flew for the first time on 2 February 1944, equipped with a four- bladed propeller. The second prototype was completed on 26 June 1944 and was equipped with an Aero-Products contra-rotating propeller. As the XP-72 displayed exceptional performance during flight tests, an order for 100 production aircraft was awarded. The order included an alternate armament configuration of four 37 mm cannon. By this time, World War II had progressed to where the need was for long-range escort fighters and not high-speed interceptors. Furthermore, the advent of the new turbojet-powered interceptors showed greater promise for the interceptor role. Thus, the production order for the P-72 was cancelled. ==Specifications (XP-72)See alsoReferencesNotes=Citations=Bibliography=== * Bodie, Warren. \\"The Whine of the Jug\\".
