Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60 (1992), is a United States Supreme Court Case in which the Court decided, in a unanimous vote, that monetary relief is available under Title IX of the Federal Education Amendments of 1972.  Case Background  The case arose when Christine Franklin, a sophomore at a high school in Georgia‚Äôs Gwinnett County Public School District claimed to be sexually abused by Andrew Hill, her teacher and a coach at the school. She also claimed that he had assaulted other students in her high school. The school district administrators became aware of the situation but decided not to take action and even encouraged Franklin to not proceed in pressing charges. However, Franklin persisted and the Gwinnett County Public Schools District eventually began to investigate the situation. Once investigations began, Andrew Hill resigned from his position at the school and the school board stopped its investigations. In result, Franklin decided to sue the Gwinnett School Board for violating the sexual harassment clause of Title IX for the goal of obtaining monetary relief and legal remedy. While Title IX is most commonly associated with requiring equality among male and female sports, a major component of it describes how schools must deal with sexual harassment complaints. Title IX claims that, ‚Äúdiscrimination on the basis of sex can include sexual harassment or sexual violence, such as rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, and sexual coercion.‚Äù When a student goes to a school with a sexual harassment complaint, title IX requires the school to respond ‚Äúpromptly and efficiently‚Äù and take ‚Äúimmediate action‚Äù. Franklin believed the school board did not follow these guidelines so she decided to sue in the attempt of getting money in return. Because the school board was on Hill‚Äôs side, they appealed and argued that one can not get monetary relief from Title IX. In a unanimous, 9-0 decision, the court ruled Franklin could get money because any and all types of relief, in appropriation, are available, in order to fix a violation of a federal right. After the ruling of the Supreme Court, the money was settled in an out-of- court settlement, of which the results were never disclosed.  Court of Appeals  Franklin‚Äôs argument and the reason she pressed charges was that she believed the Gwinnett school board violated the rights established in Title IX, and she should thus be compensated for damages. The counter argument came from Hill and the entire Gwinnett school board. Their reasoning was that Title IX did not authorize monetary awards for damages which the district court and United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit confirmed. Eventually, the case made its way to the Supreme Court on December 11, 1991. 79 days later, on February 26, 1992, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of Franklin where she was rewarded monetary benefits.  Decision  A previous case Cannon v. University of Chicago (1979), established that Title IX was enforceable through an implied right of action, so the question became whether or not monetary awards were available for damages in a private action brought to enforce Title IX. The court‚Äôs decision, written by Justice Byron R. White, stated that monetary relief was available under Title IX because it is presumed that violating a federal right calls for the use of appropriate relief as a remedy. The court also found that the harassment against Franklin was an example of discrimination based on sex. Since the court judged that because the sexual harassment against Franklin was a clear violation of Title IX, had the court not provided remedies for Franklin, Title IX would then be a law that would not award any remedies. While the judges voted unanimously in favor of Franklin, three justices held a concurring opinion written by judge Antonin Scalia. Scalia believed that there should be limitations on the use of remedies because the causes of action were implied. The justices held this opinion under the belief that the application of remedies to expand private rights could lead to problems. Yet, despite this, they still voted in favor of Franklin.  Significance  While this case confirmed that someone could receive monetary relief from Title IX, the reasoning behind the decision has a much wider application. They reasoned that since Title IX was a civil rights issue that all types of relief were available. Thus, they reaffirmed that all types of civil rights cases will allow and be open to all types of relief.

She completed her clinical qualifications at the University of Oxford and eventually specialised in internal medicine Queen's University Belfast. She has since worked in Zambia, Sheffield and Liverpool. In 1993 she was awarded the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine Blacklock medal. In 1997 she was appointed a Wellcome Trust Clinical Fellow and Lecturer. She moved to Malawi in 1997, where she lived until 2005 and was part of the Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Trust.  Research  In 2008 Gordon was made an NHS Higher Education Funding Council for England Clinical Fellow at the University of Liverpool. Her early work was the first to show how Salmonella becomes a lethal disease for HIV-positive people. She was promoted to Reader in 2012 and Professor in 2015. In 2015 she returned to Malawi where she leads the Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Trust Salmonella and Enterics Group. Gordon's research focuses on the development of vaccinations to protect against invasive bloodstream diseases caused by two groups of Salmonellae; typhoid fever and Invasive Non-Typhoidal Salmonellosis (iNTS). Gordon is committed to identifying novel vaccinations that can protect children in Africa from bacterial disease. iNTS is a rare bacterial disease that is caused by extraintestinal infection of certain serotypes of Salmonella. iNTS kills around 80,000 people each year. It is more likely to occur in patients with HIV infection or malaria and the majority of people who suffer from iNTS are in Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2011 Gordon was awarded the British Society of Gastroenterology Sir Francis Avery Jones Research Medal and in 2012 the Shire Awards for Gastrointestinal Excellence prize for Excellence in Gastroenterology. She became Director of the World Gastroenterology Organisation Blantyre Training Center in 2016. In 2018 Gordon led Africa's launch of the new typhoid conjugate vaccine, and successfully vaccinated 24,000 children in Malawi in the first six months. The first child, Golden Kondowe, received the first vaccination in Ndirande, Blantyre. The Typhoid Vaccine Acceleration Consortium (TyVAC) study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and was the result of twenty years of research of Salmonella in Malawi. The vaccine, which contains weakened strains of Salmonella, is expected to protect against typhoid and other infections. She works with local scientists, health workers and the Malawi Ministry of Health. The vaccine was shown to protect 81% of children from becoming infected with typhoid fever. Gordon and the University of Liverpool Centre for Global Vaccine Research were awarded a multi-million pound research grant to establish the Horizon 2020 Vacci-iNTS consortium. The consortium looks to develop new vaccines and research the financial and social impact of iNTS on communities in Africa impacted by the disease.

Cook as President. The primary mission of this organization was the national union of colored women. In 1896, the Colored Women's League and the Federation of Afro-American Women merged to form the National Association of Colored Women (NACW), with Mary Church Terrell as the first president.  History  In June 1892, a group of several prominent black women in Washington D.C. met together to discuss creating a club devoted to improving the conditions of black children, women and the urban poor. Some of these women were Anna Julia Cooper, Helen Appo Cook, Mary Church Terrell, Ida Bell Wells-Barnett, Charlotte Forten Grimk√©, Mary Jane Patterson, and Evelyn Shaw. Helen Appo Cook was elected the first president. The Colored Women's League was a coalition of 113 organizations, and the goal of national unity was at the forefront of the club's objectives. In a letter written in 1894 to The Women's Era, the first national newspaper published by and for African American women, Cook reported a few accomplishments of the league. These included: hosting a series of public lectures for girls at local high schools and Howard University, raising $1,935 towards a home for the league, creating classes for German, English Literature, and hygiene, and establishing a sewing school and mending bureau with 88 students and ten teachers. Mary Church Terrell also provided updates about the CWL's efforts to this newspaper. According to historian Fannie Barrier Williams, this organization had the largest membership of any African American women's club in the country.  Mergers  Although the primary goal of the CWL was national unity for colored women, this goal was not reached until July 21, 1896 when the National Association of Colored Women was formed as a result of the merging of the Colored Women's League and the Federation of Afro-American Women. The merging of the two organizations was publicly debated in the black community. Many newspapers, including the Leavenworth Herald, published opinions about the merge in their newspapers. The Colored Women's League initially declined to join the National Federation of Afro-American Women because President Cook did not have the authority to commit the league. However, Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin's appeal to protect the reputation of black women influenced the political agenda of the CWL. Ruffin's appeal was composed in response to an editorial published by a Southern white journalist, in which the author ridiculed the moral character of black women. To combat the widespread influence of negative stereotypes of black women, Margaret Murray Washington, the president of the National Federation of Afro-American Women and Helen A. Cook began making plans to discuss consolidating their two organizations. After the merger of the Colored Women's League and the National Federation of Afro-American Women, Mary Church Terrell was named the first president of the newly formed National Association of Colored Women.  Rivalries  Both organizations, the Colored Women's League and the Federation of Afro-American Women, had similar objectives in mind: advancing the conditions for black women, children, and underprivileged. However, prior to merging, these organizations did not always see eye-to-eye. The biggest factor contributing to this rivalry was the debate about which organization was the first to be officially recognized as a national organization. Mary Church Terrell, the first president of the NACW, explains that \\"although the CWL was the first to suggest there should be a national organization,\\" the first organization of black women to actually assemble nationally was the National Federation of Afro-American Women. After the creation of the NACW, the contest for leadership of the national organization created another short rivalry. Each organization was represented by seven delegates in the election process, so ties of 7-7 made the voting process difficult. Eventually, at the age of thirty-three and pregnant, Mary Church Terrell of the Colored Women's League was named the first president of the NACW. Criticism Many members of the league, especially those in leadership positions, had high social standings. In fact, some even called members of the league \\"female aristocrats of color\\". Therefore, the league faced several critiques. Some argued that the ideology of racial uplift was classist. Nevertheless, the success of the CWL inspired other black women became aware of the possibility of creating a united front for themselves and created their own clubs.  National League of Colored Women  On July 21, 1896, the Colored Women‚Äôs League merged with the National Federation of Afro-American Women to form the National League of Colored Women.

The not-for-profit goal of FIREWALL is to investigate online censorship and foster public dialogue about Internet freedom.  Controversy  FIREWALL received backlash from the Chinese Government during one of the public roundtables on February 19th, 2016, ‚ÄúNetworked Feminism in China,‚Äù about how feminists in China use the internet to build online networks and movements. On the eve prior to the event, one of the speakers, a visiting Chinese scholar and law fellow researching female reproductive rights, received threats from Chinese authorities overseas about their scheduled presentation. Ultimately, they did not participate, and an empty chair was left in their place, a nod to the empty chair of Liu Xiaobo during his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony on December 10, 2010.  Reception  The Washington Post covered how FIREWALL Internet Caf√©, a project about Internet censorship, was itself censored by Chinese authorities, while ArtFCity described how the Chinese Government might have sent citizens as agents to observe the Networked Feminism in China event in an act of cultural espionage. The China Digital Times covered FIREWALL in an article about how China‚Äôs overseas critics are under pressure from the Central Government, and Hyperallergic described how this pressure resulted in an act of self- censorship. Editorial Commentary The Daily Voice (South Korean Live Radio) expressed surprise at how attitudes that determine the Great Firewall goes beyond China‚Äôs borders.

The Old Ones are the most powerful forces ever to have existed in the various Palladium game settings, and their power dwarfs that of 'ordinary' Alien Intelligences, beings which are in general far more powerful than the gods themselves. The Old Ones' creator, Kevin Siembieda, named them so as an homage to the fictional characters of the same name by H. P. Lovecraft. Despite their origins in Palladium Fantasy‚Äîthe first and oldest of Palladium Books' Game Settings‚Äîthey are hated and feared throughout the different dimensions of the Palladium Megaverse by those beings who remember them, even those beings who have great power and are evil themselves. \\"Society\\" and achievements The Old Ones' physical and mental natures were such that to pass the time (and to feed themselves), they each seized upon a specific aspect of pain and suffering to study, psychically feeding on the emotions and suffering that would follow. For example, Ya-blik was the symbol of pestilence, betrayal, and pain, and would spread pestilence and foment those dark emotions where they did not already exist. Netosa was another of the Old Ones; its \\"portfolio\\" was that of darkness and death, and it kept sentient beings in never-ending, unreasoning fear of same to drink up the emotions that such terror generated. And Xy, greatest amongst their number, was the Great Old One of Power Incarnate, and fed upon the chaos and suffering brought by the other Old Ones as they conquered planets, galaxies, and entire dimensions in his name. These creatures, whose origins are unknown (and who may have, in fact, always existed), were the first beings to discover the megaversal energy source known as Potential Psychic Energy (PPE), and develop the \\"science\\" of magic to manipulate it. They are responsible for the creation of such magic 'schools' such as Diabolism (the use of symbols to create temporary, semi-permanent, and permanent magical effects such as spell wards), Invocations (spells performed by words and gestures on the part of a mage or shaman), Rituals (advanced and more powerful magics involving a protracted series of actions and/or sacrifices on the part of one or more mages and/or shamans), Shifting (the summoning of creatures from other locales, worlds, or dimensions for the purpose of doing the summoner's bidding), and were the creators of the first Rune Artifacts (specially designed, indestructible weapons and artifacts created by the mystical merging of a weapon with the life forces of sentient beings). Rebellion At the end of a titanic battle some 50,000 years ago in the Palladium Dimension (and an undefined, but likely even greater longer period of time in the past relative to the other Game Settings, due to the differing ages and origins of the respective universes that make up the Palladium Megaverse), the Old Ones were finally defeated by the combined efforts of hundreds of races consisting of billions of sentient beings across the Megaverse; one of the most critical factors in the defeat of the Old Ones was a powerful magic spell by a \\"former\\" Old One himself (who was by that time amnesiac, a primary member of the Forces of Light, and entirely unaware of his own origins and true nature). The aftermath of that battle saw many of those species rendered extinct. Unfortunately for the Megaverse, however, the Old Ones could not be destroyed: it was feared that the destruction of entities that powerful would cause a chain reaction (roughly analogous to a nuclear one, but mystical in nature) and an \\"explosion\\" that would destroy all universes. Instead, they were put into an eternal mystic slumber and hidden away between dimensions beyond the reach of all but the most powerful gods and (good) Alien Intelligences. Constant vigilance and effort is required to keep these beings asleep, and various members of the Great Powers of the Palladium Megaverse cooperate with one another to ensure that they never again awaken. The leader of the Old Ones is/was a Great Old One once called Xy who, through a series of circumstances and betrayal, forgot his own past and now believes himself to be Thoth, the ancient Egyptian god of Wisdom. It was he, as Thoth, who helped to fashion the super-spell that would finally force the Old Ones into mystic slumber. Powers and abilities The Old Ones possess the standard range of powers common to nearly all Alien Intelligences, only on a scale orders of magnitude more powerful than the \\"average\\" Alien Intelligence. These beings are each said to have millions of points of Mega Damage Capacity Rifts (role-playing game)#Damage and firepower, powerful enough to inflict many thousands of Mega Damage points per attack, and are believed to be capable of destroying entire dimensions unaided. The Old Ones are mystically confined and kept asleep in an intradimensional void inaccessible to all in the Megaverse except a very tiny handful of ultra-powerful beings, and are effectively indestructible). Potential threats to the entire Palladium Megaverse such as Nxla, the Four Horsemen, the Lord of the Deep, Tikilik, and the Dweller Below, were considered \\"minor\\" threats relative to the Old Ones despite their own vast powers, and were therefore spared the fate of eternal slumber placed on the Old Ones by the Forces of Light. Nxla's status is questionable, however, as some believe him to be an Old One who tricked his way out of punishment, and others believe this to be lies spread by Nxla to create fear. The Old Ones were sufficiently powerful enough to keep legions of lesser Alien Intelligences, Gods, and even dragons -usually solitary, vastly powerful creatures in their own right that call no one master -as servants and slaves. Xy has been given stats twice (Rifts World Book 4: Africa and Palladium Fantasy: Dragons and Gods) however this is only at a fraction of his former power as Thoth. Xy's stats at full power have never been printed by Palladium. The other 7 Greatest Old Ones originally had their stats printed on the final (210th) page of Old Ones 1st Edition. These stats were removed in the 2nd Edition version of the book, and the GOOs were not included in Dragons and Gods, so their abilities (much like the beings in the Ultimax Deathstone) have not been increased to 2nd Edition levels like the rest of the first edition Gods, Dragon Gods, Demon Lords and Devil Lords. Lessers Some other beings are referred to as being possible \\"lesser\\" (rather than \\"greater\\") Old Ones, including Vampire Intelligences (in Rifts World Book 1: Vampire Kingdoms and Nightbane World Book 4: Shadows of Light), Nxla (in Rifts World Book 12; Psyscape), and Slyth (in Old Ones 2nd Edition).

Background and history  According to the World Bank, Brazil is labeled as an upper middle income country with a current GDP of $1.869 Trillion as of the year of 2018. Brazil is the largest country in the LAC region (8.52 million square kilometers), with a GNI per capita of US$14,810 and with a population of 207 million (2016). A favorable external environment, credit-fueled consumption, an expanding labor force and an expansion of social programs contributed to fast economic and social progress between 2001 and 2015. During 2012‚Äì2015, Brazil was one of the largest borrowers of the World Bank Group, with a total of US$17.5 billion invested during these four years. After 2015, with the onset of the economic crisis and given limited fiscal space for new investments, IBRD lending has declined to around US$500 million per year and the program has shifted instead on building the knowledge foundations for supporting an adjustment in Brazil's growth model and in the World Bank's engagement to support it. IFC has continued to invest around US$1.5 billion per year, although with a shifting profile of clients. Brazil has had a slow growth in the last two years with a small 1.1% growth in GDP in 2017 and 1.3% growth in 2018. This small recovery has slowed down the economy significantly and caused much loss in consumer trust, and outside investment. Brazil became a member of the World Bank on January 14, 1946, with its first project starting in the late 1940s. The majority of projects that are funded or assisted by the World Bank involve public infrastructure or land management. Land Management projects usually involve direct correlation with the agriculture, sanitation, and urban planning departments. The very first project that the world bank assisted on in Brazil was started on January 7, 1949. The project was called Power and Telephone Project. The Power and Telephone Project has the joint objectives of developing hydroelectric power generation and telephone services, including long-distance services, in the highly industrialized and populated areas of Brazil. This project services light and hydroelectric management to provide sustainable lighting and energy in more rural and impoverished areas. Throughout the rest of the 20th century, the majority of projects have been over sustainability of infrastructure in poor and rural areas. Most projects have been oriented towards clean water, sustainable energy and efficient land restoration and use. As climate change, deforestation and other more recent alarming world events have taken place over the past 50 years, more and more projects are oriented towards conservation and renewable energy efforts.  World Bank involvement and focal areas  Fiscal consolidation and government effectiveness for sustainable, inclusive and efficient service delivery = Public finance = The Brazilian economy has seen much halt and stop due to the deterioration in the structure of public finance. In order to support the strengthening of the fiscal management at all levels of government, it is important to sustain the structure of the institutional and legal systems that control the public finance sector. The World Bank will assist the government in improving the fiscal sustainability and fairness of the social security system. And it will work with federal and sub national governments to increase effectiveness of services delivery in education and in health. Underlying all the World Bank's objectives is the aim to ensure that the ongoing fiscal adjustment is of high quality and does not fall disproportionately on the poor and bottom 40%, whilst laying the necessary foundation for a sustainable recovery. The Bank will work with the federal government to achieve implementation of the expenditure rule as a means to achieve fiscal adjustment and restore fiscal sustainability at the federal level, through a reduction in federal government primary expenditures in real terms. To achieve this indicator the Bank will support the federal government to rationalize public expenditures and to strengthen fiscal management, including through the programmatic Brazil Expenditure Review and Strengthening Governance in Infrastructure, and will also support the government to restore the financial sustainability of the social security system. = Safety net programs = The social safety net programs existent in Brazil lack much governmental funding and support thus increasing the vulnerability of those that depend on it for care packages and housing. Many of the people on the list to receive these program benefits are large family households who don't have enough jobs to support the whole family, and a large portion of them are single mother households. The bank aims to support funding for these programs such as the Bolsa Familia that helps provide care package food and housing for people in need. That allocation of resources to these programs help them become more agile and efficient in effectively covering the most people in need and provide them the basic resources to live well and safe conditioned lives for them and their families. The Bolsa Familia program has served over 13.7 Million families since it was created in 2003. It serves people in extreme poverty giving them housing, educational, job and health service opportunities. The World Bank has aided much investment in programs like these to help sustain equality in Brazil and help remove thousands of families out of impoverished conditions. = Education = To lower the high rate of drop outs in the public education in secondary school, the World Bank wants to provide support in the development of the educational department in Brazil's ministry of education to facilitate the growth in opportunities for children in low income areas. Their investment will continue to support selected sub national governments in the introduction of new methods of public sector management to improve education outcomes which are expected to improve average learning scores for math and Portuguese. = Health = The Bank will work to improve the effectiveness of health services delivery through ongoing interventions at the sub national level which will contribute to reduce premature mortality rate from the main Non-Transmissible Chronic Diseases in selected states and will contribute to improve system efficiency by reducing the percentage of hospitalization for ambulatory care sensitive conditions in selected states. In parallel, the World Bank will support the private provision of private healthcare services such as hospitals and private clinics to complement services provided by the SUS (the Brazilian publicly funded health care system), also targeting low- and middle-income populations Private sector investment and production growth = Employment opportunities and business investment = Achieving the World Bank goals requires sustaining high rates of investment to create well-remunerated and sustainable employment. This has proved to be the principle mechanism for poverty reduction and shared prosperity in Brazil. Accelerating growth and jobs creation in Brazil is both critical in itself and highly complementary to the needed fiscal adjustment. Restoring the sustainability of public finances is a prerequisite for improved confidence and increased investment in Brazil. At the same time, accelerating growth would facilitate the return to fiscal sustainability by boosting revenue collection. The World Bank will provide financial investment and technical assistance to the federal government to support the implementation of a wide- ranging program of reforms to improve the business environment and to sub national governments as part of ongoing operations. It will commence new infrastructure bonds with an objective to raise significant private sector financing for infrastructure projects. Inclusive and sustainable development = Land use= The World Bank has an integrated approach to building resilience of communities, ecosystems and production systems, which recognizes issues of sustainability and social inclusion as closely related. Brazil many different sets of challenges for an inclusive and sustainable development. The World Bank works to support the government in fostering more equitable economic growth, social inclusion, and efficient use of resources, focusing on interventions related to land tenure and territorial development (at national, regional and city level), management of natural resources and biodiversity, climate change mitigation and adaptation, deforestation, land degradation, and water scarcity issues. The World Bank also supports management of natural resources in a sustainable way, combining conservation with the promotion of local and regional economic development, as well as to work with the federal and state governments to sustain the low carbon emissions trajectory in agriculture and land use to which Brazil has committed to by supporting farm holdings in the adoption of landscape management and/or sustainable agricultural practices. Amazon deforestation is the most pressing issue for climate change. 9,762 km^2 were cut down between 2018‚Äì2019. 80% of deforestation in Brazil is caused by the cattle and meat industry. The most pressing issue in our current decade is the emerging problem of climate change, deforestation and preservation of the natural ambient and fauna. In Brazil, the World Bank works effectively with the preservation of the Amazon Rain forest and the sustainable cohabitation of those that use its vegetation and land. The land already used for farming and agricultural practice is also an area invested on for development, sustainability, and expansion prevention into already protected areas. = Water and sanitation= To improve access, management and efficiency of water and sanitation services in cities, the World Bank invest in the physical and institutional infrastructure to attain greater resilience to the increased variability of water supply while also focusing on pricing policies to ensure that water charges reflect provision costs. The support from the World Bank will be embedded in the broader context of water resource management and protection of scarce water resources. The bank's engagement in the water sector will continue, including at the water basin level, focused on improved water resource management, inter-stakeholder coordination, utility governance, regulation and critical investments. There are several sanitary problems with the water supply in poor areas in Brazil, especially with the conditions to which still water sources that sit above buildings are primary places where mosquito that carry the Dengue Fever or other deadly diseases reproduce. The investment from the world bank also focuses on maintaining sanitary conditions of water supply for urban and suburban areas with emphasis on reducing the liability of still water and mosquito infestation. With current events of diseases carried by mosquitoes such as the Zika Virus caused much panic over Latin America and contagion prevention. Ongoing and active projects  As of December, 2019, Brazil has had a total of 540 projects performed by the world bank. Of those 540, 44 are currently active as of December, 2019. The vast majority of the active projects are water resource sustainability projects and land management and development projects in urban, suburban and rural areas. Rural development is a sector that the World Bank deeply invests upon, with intentions to sustain economic growth and competitiveness for small farm owners and promote sustainability of land use and up to date irrigation systems. Brazil accounts for a large percentage of world exports in agricultural products, minerals and oil. Because of Brazil's abundant amount of fertile land and unquantifiable amount of natural resources, Brazil is one of the biggest world exporters of products such as meat. The 31.7% of Brazil's economy or revenue functions off of the agricultural industry. Although Brazil is a country that runs off the agricultural industry, that does not impede from the monopolization of the market and concentration of profit from a few privatized companies. The biggest agri-producers and exporters in Brazil are JBS S.A., Ambev and BRF. All three companies dominate the market and inhibit smaller farmers and industries to thrive locally or within the country. This causes a hardship for many small family farmers that do not have the resources to produce exorbitant amounts of produce with as much exporting power as the bigger and more dominant companies. The state of Santa Catarina received a $90 million loan from the World Bank to invest in increasing the competitiveness of family farming. Resources will be redirected to small producers from a farmers' organization. Through the project, households will have access to capital, technical assistance and incentives for technological innovation, increased productivity and quality, diversification and access. The project further strengthen the provision of public services needed to increase production and make it sustainable. To this end, some infrastructure investments are also made, such as the rehabilitation of 800 miles of roads in rural areas. In addition, there is also an incentive to improve public administration in support of rural competitiveness. This project with the state of Santa Catarina is an example of the type of work the World Bank does in rural areas with sustainable land use, rural farm production and competitiveness and development. Reusable energy and technological infrastructural work for the agricultural department is something that benefits job opportunities and facilitates a boost in the industry, inevitably creating economic growth and regional development. The Amazon is one of the world's largest sources of oxygen and intake of greenhouse gases in the world. It is the single most naturally diverse part of the planet and at the expense of agriculture and deforestation, thousands of acres are chopped down every year. Despite many NGOs pushing for policy change, conservation and federal funding for the preservation of the rain forest, the agriculture and mining industry constantly chops down the rain forest for resources such as wood or for land used for agriculture. The largest industries in agriculture that mostly contribute to the resistance to conservation are the cattle industry and products such as soy. The world bank has assisted Brazil in the funding of many projects lead by governmental and non governmental agencies to help spread the conservation efforts. The World Bank released a project in December 2017 called the Amazon Sustainable Landscape Project. This project is active and is set to last until December 2024. The purpose of this project is to facilitate the funding for preservation efforts of the rain forest, and to cultivate a sustainable infrastructure to cohabitate with the native vegetation and allow for its restoration and cultivation. This project wants to expand and protect over 60 million Hectares of preserved forest area, especially those bordering agricultural areas and cities. The World Bank invested $60,330,000 for this project. Rehabilitation and restoration of the forest is the second part most heavily invested on. The third part most invested on is on financing resources for the forestry and public landscape sectors to maintain the stability and efforts of the project.  Achievements and successes There was much progress done and aided by the World Bank that helped Brazil reach its development outcomes. From providing the health department millions of dollars to help sustain quality health services for low income neighborhood to providing resources for secondary schools across the country and helping kids all over Brazil have access to teachers, books and supplies required for providing a basic quality education, the World Bank has helped millions of Brazilians achieve a better quality of life and provided support for the local and federal government to enact their role and aiding this very complicated development. The World Bank has also investment millions of dollars in preserving the environment and contributing towards the funding for the infrastructural development for efficient and safe use of land without harming people and their access to food and resources. Brazil being one of the largest users of the World Bank, there is a strong economic reliance on the institution and its aid in providing Brazil, with its dense population and infrastructural obstacles, the necessary help to maintain its development as economic disparity, poverty, and lack of opportunity continue to grow.  Challenges The lack in growth of productivity, government funding for public services and programs, and the structural development in the departments of social services leads to a big difficulty in achieving and optimizing the effectiveness of the programs lead by the World Bank. Although these challenges are prominent and the lack of regulations and enforcement occur, the World Bank works hand in hand with the government to try to reduce the ripple of corruption and the offset challenges of deterioration of the societal infrastructure and services. Fiscal imbalance is the biggest issue in Brazil and causes a disproportionate amount of disparity of opportunity for the population especially the bottom 40%. With that, the World Bank tries to enforce its influence on policy, private investment, and reduction of corporate monopoly and gains.

Leo Nickerson was a cub scout leader who had died during a scout outing at Wabamun Lake on July 14, 1961. Nickerson drowned during an attempt to save five boys who had become caught in the lake during a sudden storm. He saved two of the boys, but he and the three others perished during his attempt to save the remainder. = Parent Teacher Association = Leo Nickerson was the first and for some time only school in St. Albert to have a PTA, or Parent Teacher Association. The group was formed in 1967, and replaced the Home and School Association, an organization of parents from various schools in St. Albert that was formed in 1964. When the Home and School association dissolved, it divided its funds among its schools. Leo Nickerson used its funds to buy gym equipment. The new PTA held meet the teacher nights, science fairs, various demonstrations and campaigns, and purchased supplies for use in the school. = Corporal punishment controversy = Joseph Garber, the school's first principal, and his wife Thelma, a teacher at the school, resigned from their positions amid controversy in 1969. The resignations were a result of allegations of mistreatment by some teachers toward the students. In late March, a group of parents met at a board meeting to express their concerns over the excessive use and types of corporal punishment used in the school. Examples of punishment provided by the group included hair and ear pulling, as well as arm twisting. It was also said that there had been reports of swearing and derogatory comments made by the teachers toward the students. The parents suggested that Garber's replacement come from outside of the staff at Leo Nickerson, and that the new administrator be instated immediately so that he could become familiar with the school and adequately prepare for the next school year. It was suggested that his \\"opinions regarding staff carry considerable weight.\\" Of the matter, Garber said that \\"there has to be unity of purpose, and I don't think we had it,\\" adding that \\"some things have to be cleared up, not only in our school, but in the whole district.\\" The district responded the following week in two letters to St. Albert's newspaper The Gazette that Garber's assessment was unfair to \\"the excellent educators in our district,\\" and that the statement came as a complete surprise. The letter followed by saying the board had been concerned about the climate at the school for some time, and that it would accept Garber's resignation. The district's board of trustees launched an investigation into the matter following the resignations. The production of a remedial report was assigned to Muriel Martin, supervisor of elementary education, and future namesake of Muriel Martin Elementary School. Citing privacy concerns, the board decided that the report would not be made public, as it contained comments about some staff members. Some of the suggestions in the report were that activities periods be discontinued in favour of Language Arts, that there be a minor reshuffling of teacher roles, and that a school philosophy be developed. Lowell Throndson took over Garber's position shortly after. Dr. J. W. Chalmers, the disctrict's superintendent, resigned in March the same year. It was expected that the system would have forty empty teaching positions by the end of that school term.  1970s  = Report cards = In 1970 parents were polled on the replacement of report cards with parent-teacher interviews. Such a replacement had already been put to trial at Vital Grandin, a school in the public school system. Results of the poll were overwhelmingly against the change, with 151 parents being against, 10 for, and 8 undecided. Other options the poll asked about were whether interviews should accompany report cards, if interviews should only be held if requested by either the parents or teachers, if report cards should use the \\"H, A, B, C, D\\" system, if the present system of parent teacher interviews and frequency of report cards was satisfactory, and if report cards should consist of teacher comments only but no grades at all. A teacher committee was created to enact some of the suggestions made during polling. = House system = In 1974 Nickerson's principal Frank Carnahan instituted a house system similar to that used in the UK. Students were split among four houses named for astrological signs: Aquarius (blue), Gemini (yellow), Scorpio (green), and Taurus (red). The house system allowed for both assistance among students within the same house, as well as friendly competition between the houses. Students could earn points for their houses in various ways, such as through participation in a jogging trip. School assemblies also began to be held every Monday.  1980s  = French Immersion = The school became a dual-track school with the introduction of the French Immersion program in the mid 1980s. At its outset, it served children in Kindergarten to Grade 4. = Renovations = Leo Nickerson school underwent major renovations in 1986. The renovations cost $1 million, and included the building of a new gym. A statue of Leo Nickerson was unveiled at the ribbon cutting ceremony; the ribbon was cut by his widow Sylvia, who had attended the school's opening in 1964. The following year a new playground and landscaping project was completed. The project was organized by a committee of students, parents, and teachers, who raised $77,000 to complete it.  1990s  = Logos christian program = The Logos program was introduced to the school in 1998, making Leo Nickerson a triple-track school. The Logos program was offered to both French and English students, and offered its teachings in a Christian based context. The introduction of the program saw the school's enrolment numbers rise substantially over the following years. Multiple schools in the district hosted the program until it was consolidated under one school at Joseph M. Demko school when it opened in the fall of 2019.  2010s  = 50th anniversary = The school celebrated its 50th anniversary on June 14th, 2014 and the event was marked by the painting of a mural and the laying of a memorial plaque, which was placed with the cornerstone that was laid by Sylvia Nickerson when the school first opened. The event was attended by Nickerson and her daughters. A time capsule was also placed inside a bench in the school's lobby.

Public R&D; include academic fundamental research, applied research and R&D; grants and contracts to private sectors, where later two are known as 'R&D; subsidy'. Public R&D; could be understood as a funder or a performer of an R&D; activity. According to National Science Foundation in U.S., in 2015, R&D; expenditures performed by federal governments, local governments, colleges and non-profit organizations are 54, 0.6, 64, and 20 billions of dollars, respectively.

R&D; expenditures funded by industries are 333 billion dollars. In terms of R&D; funders, public R&D; to private R&D; ratio is about 0.5. Economic impacts Economists have made significant strides to understand the dynamics of public R&D;, along with its cascading effects. Productivity Scholars generally propose that public R&D; enhances industrial productivity (e.g., Levy and Terleckyj, 1983; Nadiri and Mamuneas, 1994).However, the improvement of productivity could result in R&D; spill-over of public sectors, researcher movements and co-operation between public and private sectors. R&D; investment of private sectors Economists are particularly concerned about whether public R&D; stimulates or crowds out the private sector R&D.; It is generally known as a 'policy success', if the public R&D; (especially the government R&D; subsidy) could stimulate the R&D; investment of private sectors. So far, there is no conclusive viewpoint in the literature (e.g., Toole, 2007 ;Cohen, Coval, and Malloy, 2011; Azoulay, Zivin, Li, and Sampat, 2018). Stock returns Public R&D; is also positively related to stock returns of industrial firms (Chen, Chen, Liang, and Wang, 2020). Although they show that abnormal returns based on public R&D; ratio generate about 0.9% abnormal returns per month, and suggest that the positive relation could be interpreted by increased cash flow risks.

NPR host Lulu Garcia-Navarro said that the \\"new Pentagon Papers describe explicit and sustained efforts by the US government to deliberately mislead the public.‚Äù  Initial reporting in The Washington Post  The initial article derived from these papers, titled \\"At War With the Truth,\\" was published by The Washington Post reporter Craig Whitlock on December 9, 2019.

The group has gained millions of views and streams through their music on YouTube and streaming platforms. The gang is noteworthy for its rivalry with UK drill group and gang Moscow17. The rivalry began around 2017 and has resulted in various diss tracks between the two groups, as well as physical violence.  History  The group is notable for its rivalry with UK drill group and gang Moscow17 (based in Elmington Estate and Brandon Estate, Camberwell). These rivalries are expressed in the form of drill diss tracks, such as \\"Zone 2 Step\\" in response to Moscow17's \\"Moscow March\\", and physical violence. One member of Moscow17, Ryhiem Ainsworth Barton (also known as GB), was allegedly stabbed by a Zone 2 member. Although he survived the attack, he was later shot and killed in May 2018. In August 2018, a fight occurred in a children's playground in Elmington Estate, Camberwell. The fight involved around 30 teenagers, some armed with knives. A 15-year old was 'disemboweled' during the event after being stabbed with a long-bladed knife, causing 'massive internal-bleeding'. The boy who was stabbed was alleged to be a member of Moscow17, and the fight was allegedly between Moscow17 members and Zone 2 members. In 2018, two members of Moscow17, Sidique Kamara (also known as Incognito or SK) and Kevin Aka-Kadjo were cleared of the murder of Abdirahman Mohamed, a brother to a Zone 2 member. In December 2019, Zone 2 released a song titled \\"No Censor!\\". The song gained notoriety and became infamous on social media due to the uncensored nature of the song, with various claims of murders committed by the group as well as dead rivals being named outright and mocked throughout the song. Drill artists typically allude to people they are dissing as opposed to naming them outright. The song was taken off of YouTube in less than 24 hours of its release, but has since been reuploaded.

Background  Bueso was born in Guatemala. She was diagnosed with Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome, or MPS VI, when she was one and a half. In 2003, when she was seven years old, she and her family moved to the Bay Area so that Bueso could participate in a clinical research trial for a treatment for Morquio A syndrome at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital. That treatment successfully obtained FDA approval, and Bueso continued to participate in follow-up studies. In 2018, she graduated from California State University East Bay, where she had majored in sociology and had been involved in disability advocacy.  Threat to deferred action status  Because of deferred action, Bueso and her family were allowed to stay in the United States so that she could continue getting lifesaving treatment at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital. When the Trump administration rescinded that program in August 2019, Bueso and her family were told they had 33 days to leave the country and return to Guatemala, even though the treatment Bueso requires is not available there. UCSF Benioff staff held a rally in support of Bueso, and Congressman Mark DeSaulnier introduced a private bill that would give Bueso and her family immigrant visas. Bueso testified about her situation at a House Committee on Oversight and Reform hearing. After public outcry, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services reversed the decision and said they would continue to review deferred action requests on a case-by-case basis. In December 2019, immigration officials granted Bueso deferred action for two more years.

The production of food was weakened by an El Ni√±o induced drought, as well as Cyclone Idai affecting 3 sectors that accounted for 30% of Zimbabwe's agricultural production. As a result, the World Bank estimates that one out of every ten rural households are going without food for an entire day. Since 2018, the production of minerals, in Zimbabwe, have decreased by 27%, and agriculture has decreased by approximately 50%. Other issues such as shortages in foreign currency, fuel, and electricity have contributed to the country's economic failure. Graph of the inflation rate of Zimbabwe's bond currencies for 2018 to 2019. Inflation is also a large issue for Zimbabwe, reaching 230% in July of 2019 from 5.4% for September of 2018. Food prices have risen 319% and non-food inflation has reached 194%, since 2018. Current World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund involvement is done in hope that the government can adjust their fiscal practices in order to alleviate the cost its citizens are paying. However, the World Bank fears that political and social pressure will exacerbate Zimbabwe's macroeconomic instability.  World Bank involvement  Between 1980 and 2000, the World Bank Group has totaled up to $1.6 billion is assistance to Zimbabwe. Due to non-payment of arrears, lending was suspended after 2000, but the World Bank has remained involved using non-lending instruments and trust funds. Zimbabwe's debt to the World Bank currently values at $1.5 billion, and $1.3 billion of that is debt in arrears. The front of the paper Zimbabwe dollar, which circulated from 1980 and 1982. The World Bank has created several trust funds for Zimbabwe including: The Zimbabwe Reconstruction Fund (ZIMREF), the Zimbabwe Analytical Multi-Donor Trust Fund, the Multi-Donor Health Results Innovation Trust Fund-Global Financing Facility (HIRTF-GFF), the State and Peace-Building Fund, the Global Environmental Facility Trust Fund, and Cooperation in International Water In addition to these trust funds, the IDA allocated $72 million for a crisis project in response to Cyclone Idai. The Global Financing Facility also supports results-based financing, in rural and urban areas, to improve the health sector as well as maternal and child health in Zimbabwe.  Current projects  Indigenous Shona people of Great Zimbabwe. The result of the suspension of international lending to Zimbabwe is the creation of trust funds by the World Bank. This is done to maintain support for the vast economic and social difficulties the country faces. The international lending picture, since 2015, updated by the World Bank Group in 2019, shows that Zimbabwe had received $0 in 2015, $53 million in 2016, $2 million in 2017, $5 million in 2018, and has received $3 million in 2019. The current projects being conducted in Zimbabwe, began in 2015-2016, and were mainly done through the Zimbabwe Reconstruction Fund (ZIMREF). These projects include: # A technical assistance program ($1.3 million) supports the program- based budgeting across all central government ministries. The TA also supports the Education and Health sectors. # A capital budgets TA ($4.3 million) supports the improvement of state-owned enterprise management, public investment planning and management, and the review of the transport sector supporting aviation and road tolling reforms. # Poverty monitoring and evaluation technical assistance ($1.9 million) capacity building with the Poverty Income Consumption and Expenditure Survey. # Public Procurement Modernization Project ($2 million) supports the alignment of public legislation and constitutional law. # Public Financial Management Enhancement Project ($10 million) to improve financial reporting, internal controls, and fiscal transparency. # National Water Project ($10 million) to improve access and quality of water and sanitation services in seven small town growth centers; improve water resources planning. # Financial Sector and Investment Policy TA ($3.2 million) to improve the business climate for the private sector, especially for micro enterprises, SMEs, and the agricultural sector. # A Climate Change TA ($1.5 million) to strengthen the capacity of the government to integrate climate change into investment planning in forestry, agriculture, and the water sector.  Improvements  Several improvements have been recorded by the World Bank, as a result of trust fund efforts. As of June 2019, 800,000 women have received professional health care, and 817,000 and a total of 911,677 children have completed their immunizations due to the projects in the health sector. Regular quality and care assessments take place, and they are averaging a score of 85% when they were previously seeing results in the 75% range. There has also been a 12% increase in successful births and postnatal carehttps://www.worldbank.org/en/country/zimbabwe/overview#3. The World Banks effort in implementing fiscal practice workshops for government ministries, has extended from 3 ministries to 22 ministries and all local authorities necessary. Though the Water Project, water availability and quality has improved in Zimunya, Lupane, and Guruve. Once everything is complete, the World Bank estimates that 17,000 people will have benefitted. Other areas of improvement would include: The education component (awaiting the finalization of the Teaching Professions Bill), the corporate sector (enhancing corporate transparency and accountability), poverty monitoring (updated and refined the Poverty Income Consumption and Expenditure Survey; creating data systems that can process micro-data), and the Procurement Project (Modernization of procurement laws and the development of government procurement strategies). The Procurement Project was set in motion on June 3rd, 2019, and reporting has been enhanced, as well as improved coverage of internal audit in Central Government with 87% of the audit work plan completed.

This page covers birth defects and injuries related to the craniofacial region, the mechanisms behind the regeneration, the medical application of these processes, and the scientific research conducted on this specific regeneration. This regeneration is not to be confused with tooth regeneration. Craniofacial regrowth is broadly related to the mechanisms of general bone healing.  Function  Craniofacial regeneration is necessary following injury to the facial tissue. This can occur during surgery, where doctors fracture the face of a patient in order to correct craniofacial abnormalities such as cleft lip, Apert syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, Oligodontia, Cherubism, Crouzon syndrome, Pfeiffer Syndrome, Craniosynostosis, or Goldenhar Syndrome. Other applications include corrections to birth defects (such as hypertelorism), maxillofacial surgery, craniosynostosis, rare craniofacial clefts, or removal of tumors. This regeneration can also be necessary following trauma to the face, most often due to automotive accidents. Craniofacial defects are most common congenitally (present at birth), with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 700 live births (270,000 children per year). Common corrective procedures include intracranial surgeries (making room for brain growth through skull expansion), Cleft palate surgeries (repairing a gap in the roof of the mouth), and Cleft lip surgeries (closing a gap in the lips). Most patients who suffer from craniofacial abnormalities have a normal life expectancy, but symptoms are often present throughout the patient's life. Common symptoms and features of a craniofacial defect include abnormal cranial morphology, difficulty in cranio-related functions such as breathing, hearing, swallowing, or speech, or facial paralysis.  Research and historical context  In the 1970s, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were discovered by A.J. Friedenstein. Mesenchymal stem cell research has yielded the most promising results for craniofacial regeneration, as MSCs can be found in many types of postnatal tissues, including orofacial tissues. Alginate hydrogel, which contains nerve growth factor, has been used to deliver stem cells to tissues during regeneration.  Stem cells  While there is a lack of craniofacial-specific clinical trials regarding stem cell therapies, there has been great effort in identifying craniofacial-specific stem cell populations, precursor cells that can give rise to many specific structures of the skull. Such stem cells include bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSC), adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMCs), muscle satellite cells (MuSCs), periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs), and stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous (SHED teeth). The following section will outline the two most promising stem cell populations in craniofacial bone regeneration. = Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSC) = BMMSCs have been reported to repair craniofacial defects. In 1994, it was demonstrated that when BMMSCs were grown in culture with dexamethasone, ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, and inorganic phosphate, they differentiated into functional osteoblast-like cells. However, when challenged in vivo, it was reported that only ‚Äúa little over half‚Äù of the mice with the differentiated BMMSCs showed potential to develop bone structure. Developments in BMMSCs application to bone repair have nonetheless been proven successful in many animal models including canines, mice, and sheep. = Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMCs) = AMCs have also showed promise in craniofacial bone regeneration. In 2014, George K. S√°ndor performed a small size clinical trial (n = 13) on patients with craniomaxillofacial defects where AMCs were transplanted with scaffolds of either bioactive glass or Œ≤-tricalcium phosphate in an attempt to reconstruct the defect. Œ≤-tricalcium phosphate scaffolds are characterized by their porous three-dimensional synthetic scaffold structures that stimulate growth, migration, and differentiation in human cells leading to bone reparation. This study saw 10 out of the 13 patients successfully integrate the AMCs and scaffolds. In 2017, the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) awarded $24 million to two centers focused on craniofacial disease and injury research.  Mechanism & Important Factors  Following facial tissue injury, craniofacial regeneration occurs in a sequence of steps. The process of regeneration is initiated by an inflammatory response to injury, followed by angiogenesis, leading to mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation. Additional related steps include the healing process and nerve regeneration, which is briefly covered.  Inflammation  During inflammation, there is a disturbance of connective tissue (collagen) for release necessary healing proteins. Inflammation is a normal indication of injury and activates macrophages, which recruit lymphocytes to the site of injury. These lymphocytes secrete cytokines. Cytokines are proteins that are assist in mediating the immune response to inflammation. The presence of cytokines stimulates angiogenesis and MSCs differentiation into osteoblasts, which eventually constitute new bone. Chronic inflammation, which mimics aging, has been shown to negatively affect bone regeneration. The exact reasoning behind the limit on inflammation needed for bone regeneration is not completely understood in the context of immune responses.  Angiogenesis and VEGF  Angiogenesis occurs after inflammation and it is the formation of blood vessels from previously existing ones. This process takes place in the form of fast outgrowth and organization of blood vessels. Angiogenesis occurs in organ regeneration, tissue healing, and neoplasia processes. It has been shown that angiogenesis is highly dependent upon extracellular and inflammatory signals such as cytokines, proteases, and growth factors. Integrins, a type of transmembrane receptor protein, have been shown to be important for angiogenesis. When they are inhibited, specifically integrin Œ±5Œ≤1, angiogenesis does not occur. Targeting integrin Œ±vŒ≤5 was shown to have a negative effect on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-dependent angiogenesis. This was not shown directly in conjunction with craniofacial regeneration. Angiogenesis allows for oxygen, nutrients, inflammatory cells, cartilage, and bone progenitor (precursors) to reach the site of regeneration. Animal models that enhanced angiogenesis also showed enhanced regenerative abilities. Angiogenesis is also temporally significant for bone regeneration. It has been shown that osteoblasts that originate from vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling play a crucial role for the development of new bone during regeneration. VEGF is also a key regulator of angiogenesis. VEGF has two known roles in bone regeneration: promotion of endothelial cell proliferation and migration, and the activation of osteogenesis. Despite this knowledge, the mechanism by which VEGF controls bone homeostasis is poorly understood. In addition, VEGF is necessary for a specific bone regeneration pathway called intramembranous ossification, where mesenchymal tissue is directed towards bone formation. This involves the direct differentiation of bone progenitors to osteoblasts (contrary to a cartilage intermediate in endochondral ossification). Many primary literature papers have demonstrated that a loss-of-function experiment against VEGF in the osteoblast precursors significantly reduces ossification in craniofacial bone structures, highlighting the essential role of VEGF in craniofacial regeneration.  Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs)  Osteogenic tissue is fibrous tissue that can become bone tissue (marrow, endosteum, nutrient artery, and periosteum). Bone regeneration takes place during fracture healing and bone remodeling that takes place throughout life. Bone healing also tends to occur without scar formation and with full functional capacities being restored. Growth factors, such as bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), are important in inducing the differentiation of MSCs during bone regeneration. Bone regeneration in adults appears to mimic bone development during embryogenesis, except for the requirement of inflammation to initiate the regenerative process. Another difference between bone development and regeneration is the decreased number of osteoprogenitor cells during regeneration. During embryogenesis, MSCs aggregate and condense, creating cartilage. Some of these cells differentiate, creating membranous ossification (bone tissue formation) while some committed osteoprogenitor cells from the periosteum (type of osteogenic tissue) and undifferentiated multipotent MSC from the bone marrow lead to callus formation, which aids in fracture healing. Undifferentiated MSCs are limited in adults, but these cells along with committed osteoprogenitor cells are both involved in callus formation. Along with MSCs and osteoprogenitors, mechanobiology also influences bone regeneration. Simply put, compression can enhance bone apposition. This is known as Wolff's law, which essentially states that bone remodeling occurs to counter and adapt to loads placed upon it. Mature osteoblasts are differentiated precursor cells found in the bone marrow. MSCs are typically found in the bone marrow stroma. MSC differentiation is induced by a cocktail of morphogens and other factors. Human MSCs have been shown to differentiate with a cocktail of dexamethasone, isobutyl methyl xanthine, insulin and rosiglitazone (a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Œ≥2 (PPAR-Œ≥2) agonist) in vitro. Scientific understanding of bone regeneration in vitro is limited. Thus, in vivo assays have been explored. One such assay is the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù assay, created by A.J. Friedenstein. His test utilizes diffusion chambers (open system) in which he implanted MSCs into immunodeficient mice. When this was done, he observed that MSCs formed bone and bone marrow. His test has also been used to demonstrate self-renewal and maintenance of ‚Äústemness‚Äù in serial implantations.  Healing Process  One week following injury there are two ossification fronts lying at the end of each bony fragment. In between these two fragments is an intermediate zone consisting largely of fibroblasts and poorly differentiated osteoblasts. Fibroblasts proliferate in this area, arising from marrow cells with fibroblastic potential. From the 1st to the 3rd week following injury, regenerated bone begins to fill in the gap between the two bony fragments. The first osteons begin to appear within the depths of the growth zone and there are numerous hypertrophied vessels. The medullary canal appears by means of osteoclastic resorption.  Nerve Regeneration  Following facial injury it is also critical to restore nerve function to avoid facial paralysis. Often, patients who received surgery following injury or tumor resection suffer extensive nerve damage. This is a serious problem given the importance of facial expressions and speech for communicating in human society. For many who endure such nerve damage, they recover after 12 months; however, others may never fully recover. While there is not currently much modern medicine can do for these patients, the cutting edge of care is now nerve grafting. These grafts are taken from the masseter muscle, which controls mouth movement, or the hypoglossal nerve which controls the tongue. To avoid denervation caused by lack of stimulus, surgery should be done as soon as possible; however, it is often difficult to determine if a patient will recover naturally or whether nerve grafting is required. Generally this distinction can be made by 6 months post injury and grafting occurs soon after. Nerve grafting works through lessening the degenerative effects of denervation and by accelerating the regeneration of motor neurons. This works through providing nerve signaling distal to the site of injury, helping the regenerating nerve to find the correct path. More than half of patients (57%) of patients who receive nerve grafts showed signs of nerve function within 6 months of receiving a graft.  Experimental Models  Current approaches to craniofacial research are spearheaded by a branch of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, named the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR). With regards to regenerative medicine, the NIDCR invested $52 million in ‚Äúbasic, translational, and clinical‚Äù regenerative research in 2017. These experiments include but are not limited to: Picture credit to the Potter Lab at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. The left plane depicts a wildtype (normal) mouse embryo, and the right plane is a genetically edited mouse that lacks the gene Sp8. Normal development proceeded in the wildtype, but the Sp8 mutant lacked facial structure yet presented a tongue and a mandible. * Microengineering blood vessels: enhancing current engineering of nutrient-rich blood vessels to promote transplanted tissues and bone precursor cells (cells that will give rise to bone structure). Proper engineering of these circulating blood vessels would alleviate pressure on newly implanted cells or craniofacial structures. * Designing stronger cartilage: challenging cartilage cells in vitro (in the laboratory) with harsh conditions to mimic the environment of a craniofacial defect. It is vital that laboratory-generated cartilage be comparable in strength to natural cartilage. * Isolating bone stem cells: purifying stem cells from a collection of human fat tissue that can generate bone in vivo (animal models). Researchers are also implementing many genetic tools to further understand craniofacial regeneration. Developmental biologists have been reported to use laser capture microdissection and fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) to create an array of genes involved in craniofacial development. Identification of specific genes necessary in craniofacial development can lead to striking transgenic experiments. These types of procedures involve genetically editing organisms to understand the function of their genes. For example, using Cre-recombinase, an enzyme which makes specific cuts in the genome, researchers were able to knockout the expression of Sp8, a gene hypothesized to be essential for face development. In the resulting mouse model, it was observed that facial development was significantly impaired, yet a tongue and a mandible were present (see image). Transgenic animal models is just one way in which researchers are attempting to understand craniofacial abnormalities.  Causes of craniofacial injury   Physical injury  X-ray of a human face following a fracture to the zygomatic arch These injuries happen predominantly in young males, often as a result of traffic accidents which result in 22% of all craniofacial trauma. Craniofacial injuries can result in death due to brain damage and airway blockage. Following serious injury resulting in airway blockage, the standard of care is to intubate, which involves inserting a flexible tube into the trachea to maintain airflow, followed by immediate surgical intervention (41% of injuries). Mechanical ventilation (65% of injuries), blood transfusion (28% of injuries) and tracheostomy (22% of injuries) are also common following trauma. Head injuries often coincide with craniofacial trauma, extradural hematoma (bleeding in between the skull and the dura mater), and subdural hematomas (bleeding between the dura mater and the brain). Injury to the skull included fractures of frontal bone (20.15% of injuries), sphenoid bone (11.63% of injuries), orbital roof (13.18% of injuries), and fracture of cribriform and ethmoid bone complex (13.18%) with associated cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea. The usual surgery used to treat severe craniofacial injury occurs in three stages. Craniotomy is performed immediately, followed by orbitofacial repair 7‚Äì10 days later and finally cranioplasty after 6‚Äì12 months.  Genetic disorders  Treacher Collins syndrome, cherubism and Stickler syndrome are all examples of rare genetic conditions that cause facial deformities. These diseases manifest symptoms in the head, face, mouth, or neck region, and they influence both appearance and function. These disabilities can lead to sleep apnea, poor oral health, and speech impediments. = Treacher Collins syndrome = Same patient as above. Follow up image 6 months post reconstructive surgery. Titanium screws and plates were inserted to help hold bones in place. Treacher Collins syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant condition. Symptoms usually include downward-slanting palpebral fissures and hypoplasia of the zygomatic arches. Patients can also suffer from hypoplasia of the mandible, cleft palate, lower eyelid coloboma, microtia, atresia of the ear canal, and hearing loss. Treatments can include reconstructive surgeries of the eye, ear and zygomatic arch, orthodontics and hearing aids. = Cherubism = Cherubism is a rare autosomal dominant condition caused by mutations in the SH3BP2 gene. Patients afflicted have symmetrical enlargement of the jaws, caused by the replacement of bone with fibrous tissue. In the most severe cases, the orbital floor is affected, which results in upward- looking eyes. In some cases, patients are afflicted with missing and displaced teeth. Treatments include tooth removal and transplantation and removal of intra-bony soft tissue. = Stickler syndrome = Stickler syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder estimated to affect approximately 1/7500 newborns. Symptoms include retrognathia, maxillary hypoplasia, cleft palate, hearing impairment, musculoskeletal anomalies and cardiac defects. Treatment generally includes supportive care for musculoskeletal deformities, recognition and treatment of early hearing loss, and reconstructive surgery.  Surgery  Facial surgery is often voluntary to make features more aesthetically pleasing. Rhinoplasty is exceedingly common, with 220,000 procedures occurring each year. They are used for improving the outward appearance of the nose and for improving nasal airway flow. The first step is an incision into the columella, the skin connecting the nostrils. Surgeons can then remove cartilage and bone to correct a dorsal hump, wide tip, or crooked nose. They are also able to correct deviated septums, which are a common airway blockage. Once this is completed, the incisions are closed and splits are placed to maintain stability during the healing process. Aesthetic surgery is also common following tumor resections, where plastic surgeons correct soft tissue or bone misalignments that occurred due to the removal of a tumor. These procedures can involve bone grafts from the pelvis or ribs to replace removed bone and implantation of titanium plates and screws to hold pieces of bone together.

It is an affiliate of the Buddhist Churches of America. History Pre-establishment Walnut Grove, known to Issei Japanese as \\"Kawashimo,\\" was settled by Japanese immigrants in the early 20th century. By the end of World War I, many families were established. The growth of successive generations prompted the need for religious service within the community. Around 1923, Dharma talks (Ê≥ïË©±‰ºö h≈çwakai) became a regular practice that were held within Japanese homes. Ministers from the Buddhist Church of Sacramento traveled 25 miles to conduct these services. On other occasions, such as funerals, the community would travel to Sacramento. In 1924, a Buddhist Sunday School was formed by Tome Yoshida with about fifteen students. The tables and benches used can still be found in her house today. Establishment The church was established in 1926 and the church building completed a year later in 1927. It was recognized as a branch of the Buddhist Church of Sacramento. On February 1, 1931, it broke off from the larger church and became independent with 130 members. On January 29, 1935, the temple hosted visiting Renshi Shojo Ohtani, who led the confirmation of nearly 100 members. On the same year of the temple's establishment, a medical health club (ÁôΩËèä‰ºö,shiragikukai) was started by a group of ten teenage girls. In June 1930, a group of younger children assisted in the establishment of the Young Girls Buddhist Association (YGBA, Â∞ëÂ•≥‰ºö, sh≈çjokai), serving as the equivalent of the local Young Men‚Äôs Buddhist Association (YMBA) that was established two years earlier. The Buddhist Women's Association (Â©¶‰∫∫‰ºö, funjinkai) was officially organized on January 8, 1932.In May 1938, the YMBA and YWBA merged to form the Young Buddhist Association (YBA). World War II and aftermath The evacuation of Japanese Americans during World War II led to the temple's closure. Japanese from the area were sent to Merced and Turlock Assembly Centers and then to the Amache, Colorado and Gila, Arizona Relocation Centers. Immediately after the war on July 27, 1945, Shigeo Kato and his family returned to Walnut Grove; who with Tomio Matsuoka, Rev. Takeo Agatsuma (Methodist Church minister), and Ralph Sugimoto; prepared to receive other Japanese. The church building functioned as a hostel at this time. Returnees from the Isleton area found their temple looted and damaged. The building was sold and finds donated to the Walnut Grove Buddhist Temples and New York Buddhist Academy. Isleton residents ultimately became part of the congregation at Walnut Grove. On December 16, 1945, the reverend Takuyu Shirakawa returned and the church sponsored a combined Memorial Service and H≈çonk≈ç (Â†±ÊÅ©Ë¨õ) for members who had passed away during the war. The Buddhist Women's Association and the YBA were also reactivated at this time.

Benson is a visual effects producer born in 1958. She studied visual effects at the University of Arizona. She is best known for her work in Creature, Aliens, Spy Hard and Street Fighter. In 1987 she became the first woman to win an Oscar for special effects work in recognition for her work on the 1986 film Aliens. The film also won a BAFTA for special effects and a Saturn Award.  Filmography  Her first work came on Slapstick of Another Kind (1982) where she worked as a production secretary. Benson‚Äôs next project came in 1984 as an associate visual producer on the film City Limits. She next worked Creature, which was released in 1985. Meanwhile, she was also hard at work on Aliens, the sequel to the 1979 hit, Alien. Upon its release in 1986, Aliens not only garnered attention for its stellar acting performances and directing, but also for the groundbreaking special effects used in the film. For her work on the film, Mrs. Benson was awarded an academy award in 1987. She followed up Aliens, with work on Street Fighter (1994) and Spy Hard (1996), before retiring from the industry in 1997.  L.A. Effects Group  For most of her career, Benson worked for the L.A. effects group. The L.A. effects group was founded in 1983 by a group of prominent visual effect specialists working in Hollywood. Many of Benson's more prominent credits come from her time at the L.A. effects group. She joined the group between 1983 and 1984, working on the groups first film Creature, tied on as a visual effects producer. Following the release of Creature, the group was hired to handle the special effects to the 1986 film Aliens. She worked as a visual effects producer alongside Robert Skotak, Stan Winston, and John Richardson.  Aliens  Benson is best known for her work in the 1986 film Aliens. Reviews of its use of puppets and props refer to it as the most advanced and detail oriented as the reviewers had ever seen in their cinematic careers, resulting in excellent reviews for the film overall. Critics also praise its use of figurines and miniatures to make scenes appear much larger on screen by using rear projection, mirrors, beam splitters, and camera splits. This advanced special effects work was seen as creative and novel for the time period. The special effects team also produced alien suits that were more flexible and more life-like compared to the ones used in the previous film. Mannequins were used when human actors were not an option; and these mannequins were able to be bent into positions not achievable by an actor. It was also possible for them to be blown up to simulate a gunshot wound to an extraterrestrial being. In 1986 when the film was released, these effects were viewed as the most advanced special effects to date.

Biography  Edward Roche was born in County Cork, Ireland on 10 April 1754 to Lawrence Roche and Mary Manning. He left Ireland at age 14 and arrived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where he reportedly became an apprentice with a local merchant. On April 1, 1782, he married Eliza Brinckle in Red Lion Hundred, Delaware; the couple would go on to have nine children. Following his apprenticeship, Roche launched his own business in New Castle, Delaware at the age of 21. Shortly afterwards, the Revolutionary War broke out. Roche, inspired by the writings of the Founding Fathers and other early Americans calling for independence, joined the local militia. Records show that he became the Paymaster of the Delaware Regiment on April 5, 1777 under Colonel David Hall. His regiment joined General George Washington and the Continental Army in New Jersey shortly afterwards. The Delaware men were reported to have fought at the battles of Brandywine, Germantown, and Monmouth, as well as served during the encampment at Valley Forge. However, Roche makes no mention of these battles or encampment in his pension application, nor does he appear on the digitized muster roll from Valley Forge. On September 10, 1778, he was recommissioned as Paymaster and Lieutenant in the Delaware Regiment.Delaware Regiment, 1777-1780, Revolutionary War Rolls, 1775-1783, War Department Collection of Revolutionary War Records, Record Group 93; National Archives, Washington. D.C. Roche remained in his roles with the regiment as they began their march to join the Southern Campaign on April 16, 1780. During the Battle of Camden on August 16, 1780, he became one of 47 prisoners of war from his regiment taken by the British forces. Several accounts reported: ‚ÄúIn this battle the regiment of Delaware was nearly annihilated.‚Äù Roche was held until paroled at the end of the war. It was said in an obituary that his experience ‚Äúwas on that account, treated with so much severity as to impair his constitution for the rest of his life.‚Äù left Upon his return to Delaware after the War, Roche started over in business, met and married his wife, and started a family. On July 4, 1783, he met with Continental Army Surgeon James Tilton, Maj. James Patten, Capt. William McKennan, and Lt. Stephen McWilliam in Wilmington to establish the Delaware State Society of the Cincinnati. He was elected as the group's first Treasurer and would also serve as Secretary. In February 1800, Roche was selected by the society to deliver an oration on the death of George Washington at Second Presbyterian Church in Wilmington. The society continued to meet on July 4 in Wilmington until it formally disbanded in 1802. His membership certificate signed by George Washington is currently in the collection of the Tennessee Historical Society, a donation likely made by his descendants who relocated to Nashville in the 1800s. In 1791, Roche was appointed as a delegate to Delaware's Constitutional Convention. He was then elected to serve in the first legislative session under the new state constitution in 1792 as a member of the state House of Representatives after a failed bid for the United States Congress. In 1798, Roche was elected to the State Senate. He is also credited with helping to organize the water department for Wilmington. Following his short state political career, Roche was appointed as a Notary on April 18, 1800, a position he held for approximately 20 years. Around this time, he was also commissioned as a Justice of Peace, another position he held for many years until around the time of his death. During this period, he served as First Lieutenant of the Veterans Corps of Delaware before it was disbanded in 1802. However, the idea was revisited upon new threats from Great Britain in the War of 1812. During that time, Roche served as Second Lieutenant in the Veteran Home-Guard for defense of Wilmington, Delaware. On May 20, 1815, he was appointed by Governor Daniel Rodney as Escheator of New Castle County. In 1818, Eliza Roche died, and Edward went to live with two of his adult daughters who would help him raise the daughters of his deceased son. Roche applied for his pension for time served as an officer in the Revolutionary War at this time, and he was awarded $20 per month.The Pension Roll of 1835, Vol¬∑ II, United States Senate However, on July 10, 1820, Roche received word that his pension was revoked. He appealed the decision based on small overall value of items owned and lack of assurance in future income from appointments as a Notary and Justice of the Peace. The pension was not renewed. On April 6, 1821, Edward Roche died. He was buried in the Old Swedes Churchyard at Wilmington.

The pathogen was initially discovered to be coincidentally associated with symptoms of pecan fungal leaf scorch in 1998 and has subsequently been found to be endemic in the southeastern United States, as well as Arizona, California, and New Mexico. Host and symptoms Research has so far been identified in 30 cultivars of pecan that are susceptible to pecan bacterial leaf scorch. Some varieties appear to be more highly susceptible to infection than others and no resistant varieties have yet been identified. Symptoms of pecan bacterial leaf scorch become apparent in late spring, with browning and necrosis of terminal leaflets. These symptoms can be confined to the leaves on one side of a shoot and may be present on all or some of the leaflets. As summer progresses, symptomatic leaflets eventually abscise, leaving behind the rachis, which too eventually falls from the plant. Symptoms can be confined to single or multiple branches, but over multiple years will spread throughout the plant. While the symptoms do not kill the trees, the weakened health leads to reduced yields over time. There are other causes of similar symptoms, such as pecan scorch mites and drought stress, thus a laboratory analysis is recommended when diagnosing the disease. Disease cycle Owing to the common cultivation practice of grafting, Xylella fastidiosa often spreads into new orchards through the grafting of infected scion material on clean rootstocks or through infected rootstocks. Additionally, the disease is known to be vectored by certain insects. Thus far, three leafhoppers and two spittlebugs have been shown capable of transmitting the bacteria to pecan, with glassy-winged sharpshooters and adult pecan spittlebugs believed to be the primary vectors responsible for its spread. Management The primary management strategy for disease mitigation is to ensure that new orchards are planted with non- infected plants, in order to reduce the initial inoculum that can be spread by insect vectors. This can be facilitated by closely examining nursery trees the summer before transplanting, to confirm that they are asymptomatic for the disease. Additionally, a hot water treatment of the scion material just prior to grafting, has been demonstrated to eliminate the pathogen with a 97% success rate. Given the delayed nature of symptom development, this practice is recommended to reduce the odds of inadvertent graft transmission of the bacteria. In the event of symptom development in an orchard, infected trees can have limbs and branches pruned to eliminate the disease. It is recommended that this practice be carried out as soon as possible, cutting several feet behind the symptomatic areas. This technique is only recommended for the initial infections in an orchard, on trees displaying terminal symptoms (i.e. far from the trunk), and is not guaranteed to eliminate the pathogen. A better method is to remove the tree entirely from the orchard. Another management technique is to reduce the number of insect vector carrying the disease. Known insect vectors can be monitored through yellow sticky cards or traps, and when populations are sufficiently high, insecticide sprays can be commenced to reduce the chance of disease spread. Additionally, pecan orchards can be deliberately planted away from habitat favored by the glassy-winged sharpshooter, e.g. citrus, peach, and grape orchards, to reduce populations of the disease vectors.

Southern California Black Walnut History The first walnut orchard to be planted in California was in 1856, by Ozro W. Childs, in what is now the center of Los Angeles. William Wolfskill, who is considered the founder of the first commercial orange orchards in California, also planted hard-shell English walnuts in the Los Angeles Area. Other early walnut growers of both hard- and soft-shell varieties include Russell Heath, Frank E. Kellogg and William Huston Nash, and W. E. Stuart. Joseph Sexton (1842-1917), founder of the first soft-shell walnut orchard in California. His nuts helped start the walnut industry in Southern California.In the winter of 1869, Joseph Sexton planted the first known commercial walnut orchard in Goleta, California, after purchasing a bag of English walnuts in San Francisco that he was told were from Chile or China, no one knows for certain. This orchard contained 1000 trees, of which 250 were part of Sexton's personal orchard. Around the same time in 1870, Felix Gillet, a nurseryman in Nevada City, California, was importing scion wood and nursery stock from France. Gillet is credited with introduction of Franquette and Mayette cultivars to California, as well as other French cultivars. Gillet established his orchard in Northern California in 1871. He grafted and budded the French cultivars for commercial use and used a selection program for his seed to cultivate new varieties of walnuts suited for California. Many of the varieties of the walnuts grown in California were introduced by Gillet and Sexton; out of 35 varieties, the 7 varieties they introduced from seedlings and selections make up 82 percent of total walnut acreage. Felix Gillett (1835-1908), was the founder of the Barren Hill Nursery, in Nevada City, California. From 1879 to 1885, Luther Burbank conducted the first walnut breeding experiments, observing that walnut species easily fertilized with each other. He observed that the hybrid walnut trees were more vigorous that either parent trees. Burbank gave name Royal to hybrids between eastern American black walnuts (J. nigra) and northern California black walnuts (J. hindsii). He also named hybrids between north California black walnuts and English walnuts (J. regia) \\"Paradox\\". Growers eventually accepted that the Paradox hybrids had superior attributes being more vigorous and disease resistant to crown and root rot. A modern-day variety of walnuts grown California is the Serr walnut, developed by UC Davis professors Eugene F. Serr and Harold I. Forde. From 1945-1968, their extensive walnut-breeding program created seedlings which exhibited desirable traits such early production, moderate tree vigor, pest and disease tolerance, and high nut quality. From 1,734 controlled cross walnut seedlings, Serr and Forde selected 10 new English walnut varieties for release in 1968. The Serr variety (named after Serr's death in 1968) now occupies 23,667 acres, or 12 percent, of California walnut acreage. Other varieties selected were Tehama, Gustine, Chico, and Vina. Forde continued making specific crosses and progeny evaluations until retiring in 1978. His persistence resulted in the release of four more Serr-Forde selections: Chandler, Howard, Sunland, and Tulare. The Chandler variety, a late-leafing, lateral-bearing walnut is very popular with California walnut growers. It represented 75 percent of nursery stock delivered in 1993. With the expansion of the walnut industry, growers soon experienced problems in marketing their crop. The rapid increase in acres planted to walnut and lack of organization resulted in prices fluctuations and buyers unfairly competing with one another for commissions. In 1933, the Walnut Marketing Board was formed under the Agricultural Adjustment Act, to oversee quality control and marketing of the walnut in California. To this day the Walnut Marketing board is responsible for implementing the federal marketing order for California walnuts. To emphasize its role in managing the walnut market, the Walnut Control Board changed its name in 1962 to the Walnut Marketing Board. To further promote the export of walnuts, the California Walnut Commission was created in 1987 the governor of California. The commission differs from the Walnut Marketing Board, which by a federal order is responsible for standards, statistics, crop estimates, research, and domestic marketing. Economic Impact In 2018, California produced 676,000 tons of walnuts, up from 2017 where 630,000 tons were produced. Walnut production was the seventh most valuable agricultural commodity in California in 2017, valuing at $1.59 billion in cash receipts. California also leads the nation in walnut production, producing 100 percent of all walnuts grown in the United States. As a result of the trade war between the United States and China, farmers in California received about $76.3 million in federal subsidy payments from USDA, where some of the subsidies were received by walnut farmers. Over the past ten years, as production has increased, total acreage used in the production of walnuts has increased along with it; in a USDA report, walnut-bearing acreage in California grew 53 percent from 218,000 acres in 2007, to 335,000 acres. Yield per acre also increased, from 1.50 tons per acre in 2007 to 1.87 tons per acre in 2017, an increase of about 25 percent. Exports In 2017, an estimated $1.37 billion of walnuts was exported from California to foreign countries. It was California's fifth most valuable agricultural export after wine, pistachios, dairy products and almonds. The largest importers of California walnuts were the European Union, Japan, Turkey, and South Korea; the European Union imported the most walnut, with 36% of all walnuts exported. Recently, several countries have changed their tariff policy on walnuts from California. In 2018, exports to India, the 8th largest importer of California walnuts, declined after as a result of weakness in the Indian rupee, and after a 100% import tariff was levied on the crop, up from 30.9%. Before the tariff, India imported 10,468 tons of walnuts. In September 2019, a trade deal was reached between the United States and Japan, reducing and eliminating tariffs on key agricultural goods. The deal announced a reduction of tariffs on U.S. wine, tomato paste and beef, while completely eliminating tariffs on almonds and walnuts. Walnuts have been significantly affected by trade disputes, facing high tariffs in China and Turkey, losing an estimated $700 million as a result. Cost of Production In order to produce walnuts in California, multiple factors must be taken into account in order for orchards to be success. One study by the University of California, Davis, sets out specific guidelines on and the costs associated with establishing an orchard and producing walnuts. For instance, as a result of new legislature passed by the State of California, companies with more than 25 employees are to pay their laborers $11 per hour starting in 2018, and increase hourly wages each year buy $1 until the minimum wage is $15 per hour. This, along with lower thresholds for overtime pay, has increased the cost of labor used on farms. Machine operating costs also determine the cost of production, where diesel gasoline is subject to a 13 percent state sales tax, as well as regular gasoline, which is subject to a 10.17 percent tax. Property taxes are calculated differently in each county, and so, are 1 percent of the average value of the property. This ends up being $325 per acre per year after 5 years. Property insurance is also needed to run an orchard according to guidelines. The cost of property insurance is calculated as 0.846 percent of the average value of the orchard's assets over their useful life. Liability insurance, which ensures that an orchard is able to pay a legal obligation for liability damages, is estimated to be $810 for the entire orchard. Crop insurance is necessary, as well; available to walnut growers, this insures against unavoidable loss of production, damage or poor quality resulting from adverse weather condition.

History  In return for the installation of nuclear testing center in Mururoa in French Polynesia, the General de Gaulle promised to provide free Polynesian television. In 1963, the implementation of television transmitters was launched and RTF headquarters on Dumont D'Urville Street in Papeete was enlarged in 1964 to accommodate the new ORTF television studios. Since October 3, 1965, the first ORTF T√©l√© Tahiti images have been broadcast from the small studio of 45 m2 of the station and can be received from around Papeete to the part of Moorea in front of Tahiti. The channel then broadcasts three hours a day programs from metropolitan France six months late and national newsletters from the previous week. A few years later, with the introduction of new relay transmitters, a local newscast is broadcast every day of the week. Following the break-up of the ORTF in 1974, the French overseas television stations were integrated into the new French national program company France Regions 3 (FR3), the new French channel of the regions, within France of the FR3 DOM-TOM delegation. The channel became FR3-Tahiti on January 6, 1975 and, like each regional metropolitan station, produced and broadcast a regional newscast, but was also responsible for ensuring territorial continuity in the audiovisual field by broadcasting programs from metropolitan television channels. It was finally able to be received by microwave in the Leeward Islands. The transition to color took place in the course of the year 1977, at the same time as the first satellite link with Paris. The December 31, 1982, the channel took the name of RFO Tahiti following the creation of the national company of programs RFO (French Overseas Radio-Television) by transfer of the activities of FR3 for Overseas. Its missions remain unchanged, but the new structure has its own budget that should allow it to move from the role of broadcaster to that of program producer. During the following sixteen years, RFO Tahiti gradually acquired quality technical equipment to produce and broadcast more and more regional programs. Advertising on the television channel was permitted on February 1, 1984. In March 1988, the channel was broadcast by satellite to reach all French Polynesia, and in May, a second radio channel called RFO 2, was launched while the first television channel was renamed RFO 1. On December 26, 1994, RFO 1 saw its monopoly crumble and faced competition from Canal+ Polynesia, which was setting up in French Polynesia, followed on February 14, 1995 by the bouquet of private and pay programs T√©l√©fenua, and then by the French Polynesia government chain Tahiti Nui TV on June 29, 2000. RFO changed premises and moved to its new headquarters to PƒÅmata'i, Fa'a'ƒÅ in June 1997. On February 1, 1999, RFO 1 became T√©l√© Polynesie, following the transformation of RFO into France Overseas Network. At the end of 2000, by decision of the trusteeship, RFO lost the broadcasting rights of TF1 sports broadcasters, in favor of Tahiti Nui TV. While it was possible for all Polynesians to receive TV channels New Caledonia, TV Wallis and Futuna, Tempo Caledonia and France O thanks to the satellite Intelsat 701 and RFO since 2003, T√©l√© Polynesia and France T√©l√©visions decided to encrypt T√©l√© Nouvelle Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna TV on the territory of French Polynesia from June 1, 2010. The Audiovisual Reform Law No. 2004-669 of July 9, 2004 integrated the program company R√©seau France Outre-mer into the public broadcaster France T√©l√©visions, which depends on T√©l√© Polynesia. Its president, R√©my Pflimlin , announced on October 12, 2010 the change of name of the Network France Overseas in Network Overseas 1 rd to adapt to the launch of DTT in Overseas. All television channels on the network changed their name on November 30, 2010 at the start of TNT and Tele Polynesia became Polyn√©sie Premi√®re. The name change refers to the leading position of this channel on its broadcasting territory and its first place on the remote control and its numbering in coherence with the other antennas of the group France Televisions. In 2018, the definite article \\"la\\" was added to the Overseas 1√®re channel names, so Polyn√©sie 1√®re became Polyn√©sie la 1√®re.http://www.fxgpariscaraibe.com/2017/09/les-chaines-1ere-changent-de-nom- l-an-prochain.html Programming Until the start of TNT overseas, the metropolitan television channels were not broadcast in French Polynesia. T√©l√© Polynesia thus broadcast a program consisting of three hours per day of own productions in French and Tahitian giving priority to proximity, programs from other RFO stations (information, magazines RFO Paris), but reruns or recovery live from the programs of the France T√©l√©visions group (news, magazines, sports, fiction, games, movies, entertainment and youth programs), Arte and independent producers. Since 30 November 2010 and the arrival of metropolitan public channels, Polyn√©sie 1√®re had to increase its own productions, with 25% of local programs and more, giving priority to proximity and addressing economic and social problems of the territory (emissions special events, political debates, recording of shows, football matches, midnight mass, Telethon). The channel is now free to choose its own programs and, thanks to the increased budget it enjoys, it has the necessary means to produce, co- produce and buy. The possibility of taking back certain programs from France T√©l√©visions channels is still possible and the major sports events, in particular football, rugby, tennis, cycling are now all broadcast live from Paris.

The pageant is inspired by Miss Universe's slogan \\"Confidently Beautiful,\\" and henceforth adopted the theme \\"Confident, beautiful, and empowered Filipinas.\\" History Until 2011, the Philippine representatives to the Miss Universe pageant were known by the title Binibining Pilipinas - Universe. The title Miss Universe Philippines was first given to Janine Tugonon during the Binibining Pilipinas 2012 coronation night, and since then the title has been continuously given to the competition's annual winners. In 2019, the Miss Universe franchise in the Philippines, previously held by Binibining Pilipinas, was granted to a new organizing body headed by national director Shamcey Supsup-Lee, which paved the way for the creation of the new Miss Universe Philippines Organization. The new organization is tasked to hold a separate standalone pageant in the selection of the future Miss Universe Philippines titleholders from 2020 onwards. Prior to Miss Universe Philippines, the title was awarded by the Binibining Pilipinas Charities, Inc. through the Binibining Pilipinas pageant from 1964 to 2019.

Artifacts classified as Mosul are some of the most intricately designed and revered pieces of the Middle Ages.  Background  Mosul Ewer The school of metalwork in Mosul is believed to have been founded in the early 13th century under Zengid patronage. During this time, the Zengid region was operating as a vassal under the Ayyubid Sultanate. Control over Mosul as a city central to trade between China, the Mediterranean, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia was contested between the Zengids and the Ayyubid sultan, Saladin, throughout the early acquisitions of the Ayyubid Sultanate in Syria and Iraq after the decline of Fatimid rule. However, the Zengids remained in Mosul and were allowed some degree of authority under the Sultanate. Around 1256, the Mongol occupation of Iraq began, and the region became a part of the Ilkhanate. Of the artifacts agreed to be \\"nabish al- Mawsili\\" (of Mosul), approximately 80% were produced after the commencement of Mongol rule in Mosul. However, it is unclear as to whether or not all of these artifacts were produced within Mosul and later exported as esteemed gifts, or created elsewhere by Mosulian artisans who relocated but maintained the \\"al- Mawsili\\" signature.  Design  The process of creating these luxuriously inlaid objects is somewhat complicated and has multiple stages. First, designs are formed on the surface of the metal (usually copper or brass) by relief, piercing, engraving, or chasing. Color is then added to the crevices of the surface by encrustation, overlay or, most commonly, inlay of precious metals. These metal inlays could be sheets or wires hammered into place. The area around the inlaid design was often roughened or covered with some sort of black material. Each craftsman in the industry had their own personal specialization. This specialization could be in a particular metal, technique, object, or step in the process. There are two reasons the casting step of the process usually took place in an urban workshop. The first is simply because most patrons were located in these urban areas. The second is because it would be too difficult to move all of the heavy equipment necessary for casting from one rural location to the next. Inlayers and precious metalworkers were able to travel with ease and were not confined to the workshops as casters were. There were three main inlay innovations that are believed to have originated in Mosul in the thirteenth century- gold inlays, black inlay, and background scrolls inlaid with silver. Close-up of intricate designs on Ewer The designs themselves are quite varied in subject matter. Some of the popular motifs include: astrology, hunting, enthronements, battles, court life, and genre scenes. Genre scenes, images of everyday life are particularly prominent. Among the original design traditions there is evidence that can trace them to East Asia through the designs within textiles. Mosul was a great textile industry during the same period that they were producing these inlaid objects and they happened to specialize in reproductions of Chinese silks. It is speculated that many of the traditional metalwork designs were heavily influenced or even direct copies of these silk reproductions. Historically, many scholars have argued that the Mongol sack of Mosul led to the demise of the luxury metalworking industry, however modern scholarship and an abundance of evidence disproves this. For example, it is known that Mosul metalworkers received an imperial commission by Il-Khan Abu Sa'id in the last years of the Ilkanate. Not only did Mosul continue to produce elaborate inlaid objects after the Mongol sack, they also altered their traditional stylistic choices to coalesce with Mongol taste. There was a new emphasis on minuscule style, the figures represented reflect the Ilkanhid fashion of the period, and they started to put more emphasis on pattern over figuration.  Scholarship  The scholarship surrounding Mosul Metalwork has been ongoing for a very long time, since it became the first Islamic objects d'art studied in Europe, due to its early arrival on the continent. The diverse opinions on what constitutes as Mosul Metalwork arise due to the style's dispersion across lands and through the component of signatures which identify creators as \\"al Mawsili\\", meaning \\"of Mosul\\". Within the section of metalwork with signatures, twenty-seven out of the thirty-five state themselves as \\"al- Mawsili\\". Out of those, eight state their provenance through the name of the people for which they were created along with statements declaring their engendering within Mosul. Some notable scholars that have helped shape the basis of this study include: Joseph Toussaint Reinaud, Henri Lavoix, Gaston Migeon, Max Van Berchem, Mehmed Aga-Oglu, David Storm Rice. In the early years of Mosul Metalwork, around 1828, Joseph Toussaint Reinaud, published a collection that included the first item to clearly state its creation in Mosul, the 'Blacas ewer', an artifact consistently scrutinized by scholars when exploring Mosul style. Then in the 1860s the credibility of Mosul was being questioned by scholars, it was during that century that Henry Lavoix declared that Damascus, Aleppo, Mosul, and Egypt all created inlaid metalwork, but specifically singled out Mosul as a source for a unique style unseen throughout the medium. A critical point in the scholarship came in the beginning of the 20th, through Gaston Migeon, whose claims over the precedency of Mosul caused objection and an urgency for reliability. Migeon also wrote the first comprehensive article introducing the inlaid Islamic metalwork. In the following years, the fluctuation of precedence of Mosul and the lack of it continued, leading up to David Storm Rice, who released the first series of articles exploring the complexities of multiple objects, a process similar to that of Max Van Brehmen and Mehmed Aga- Oglu, two scholars that impacted the relevance and viability of Mosul Metalwork, some of which included the Blacas Ewer, Louvre basin and the Munich Tray. Present day, Mosul Metalwork is still elusive, and lacks a sustaining amount of scholarship, but scholars continue to construct a field that utilizes substantiated evidence through designs, inscription, and other items engendered specifically in Mosul around the 13th century. An example of this is represented in an article written by Ruba Kana' An who utilizes its iconography and description to construct the argument stating the Freer Ewer as one of many metalworks constructed in Mosul.

It is one of a number of churches named after Thomas Becket following his martyrdom after having previously been dedicated to the Virgin Mary. It is a Grade I listed building. The church has 12th-century origins and was substantially remodelled in the 14th, 15th, 18th and 19th centuries.  History  The church is adjacent to a ruined Roman villa. There was evidence of St Aldhelm working in the area and there was an Anglo-Saxon church constructed in the area with a Norman church later being erected to replace it. There it was given the parish name of Ditchridge. Following the Norman Conquest of England, King William I of England gave the land and church to William De Ow. It was rebuilt in 1158 using stone from the nearby Hazelbury quarry. It was originally dedicated to the Virgin Mary but following the martyrdom of the Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Becket, a small chapel dedicated to him was constructed nearby in 1190. As Box was on the route to the shrine of Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral, Kent for pilgrims, by the end of the 13th century, it was rededicated to Thomas Becket. The chapel was renamed Hazelbury Chapel following the church's re-dedication. In the 15th century, the tower was heightened with a bell installed and restoration took place in 1713. In 1831, due to the church being too small to meet demand the Victorians expanded the church. In 1896 Harold Brakspear carried out a renovation of the church. The high pews were removed and lowered along with the floor. The plaster on the wall was removed to reveal hidden memorials and 14th century encaustic tiles in the chancel which were also restored. The restoration cost ¬£3,500 (¬£ in ). The Hazelbury Chapel was restored in 1926. In 1960, English Heritage granted the Church of St Thomas √† Becket grade I listed status. Churchyard Grave markers in the churchyard date to the seventeenth century. There are numerous mounds in which bodies were buried one atop the other; in keeping with medieval custom, these double burials were always situated on the south side of a church \\"as no-one wanted the shadow of the Church to fall on his grave\\". According to legend, a pyramidical tombstone in the churchyard was contrived to prevent the deceased's wife from dancing on his grave. Burials in the churchyard slowed to a trickle after the opening of the Box cemetery in 1858.

Ricquier has been a member of the French Academy of Sciences since 2002, and a professor of biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Paris Descartes since 2003.  Biography  Ricquier is a university professor and hospital practitioner at facult√©ÃÅ of medicine at the University of Paris-Descartes, and at the Necker-Enfants malades Hospital, since 2003. He directed the \\"Centre de recherche sur l'endocrinologie mol√©culaire et le d√©veloppement\\" of the CNRS in Meudon from 1997 to 2002, then the CNRS unit \\"Biologie des Transporteurs mitochondriaux et m√©tabolisme\\" from 2002 to 2008 at facult√©ÃÅ de m√©decine Necker Paris Descartes and at the Institut de recherches Necker-Enfants Malades. He was Head of the Metabolic Biochemistry Department at Necker Enfants Malades Hospital and at AP-HP from 2003 to 2014. He was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences on 19 November 2002.  Works  Ricquier specializes in the physiology and biochemistry of mitochondria, adipose tissue and thermogenic mechanisms. He is an expert on brown adipose tissue. His work has contribu√©ÃÅ to identify a family of proteins involved in mitochondrial respiration, ATP yield, heat production and mitochondrial control of the level of cellular oxygenated free radicals. Ricquier described in 1976 a mitochondrial membrane protein specific for brown adipocytes, later named UCP (uncoupling protein) and identified by David Nicholls as the protein responsible for heat energy dissipation. Having isolated antibodies specific to this protein, he demonstrated brown adipocytes in neonates and adult patients and demonstrated that the sympathetic nervous system controls the development of brown adipose tissue and the synthesis of DCS in animals and humans. With Fr√©deric Bouillaud, in 1984 and in collaboration with Jean Weissenbach at the Pasteur Institute, he isolated and sequenced the complementary DNA of the UCP and the UCP gene from rodents and humans. He then analyzed the mechanisms of control of the tissue-specific transcription of the UCP gene. In addition, he studied the functional organization of this membrane protein. Ricquier identified and characterized in 1997 a second UCP protein called UCP2, the brown adipocyte UCP being renamed UCP1. He also identified a new cerebral mitochondrial transporter, BMCP, an avian UCP and a renal mitochondrial transporter KMCPAnne Haguenauer, Serge Raimbault, Sandrine and contributed to the identification of the first plant UCP protein. He was able to obtain mice without the UCP2 gene, demonstrating the essential role of this gene in innate immunity and the limitation of free radical levels, particularly in macrophages in collaboration with Denis Richard at Laval University. This function of UCP2 has been confirmed by the demonstration of a protective role of UCP2 against atherosclerosis. Ricquier has demonstrated that mutations in the UCP2 protein induce congenital hyperinsulinism in children at birth. He also described a protective role for UCP2 against autoimmune diabetes. Applications of the work include metabolic diseases (obesity, diabetes), nutrition, degenerative diseases and autoimmune diseases involving oxygenated free radicals in atherosclerosis and neurodegeneration.

Some sources give his year of death as 1840 or 1873.  Biography  He was the son of Franciscus Donatus Witdoeck (1766-1834), a painter and professor of architecture at the Royal Academy, who gave him his first lessons. Later, he studied with Ferdinand de Braekeleer and Mathieu-Ignace Van Br√©e. One of his ancestors, Hans Witdoeck, was a student of Peter Paul Rubens. In 1824, he accompanied Colonel on a scientific expedition sponsored by King William I of the Netherlands. They visited Algeria, Greece, Egypt and India; returning in 1827 through Italy. He brought back numerous sketches of architecture and antiquities, notably from the island of Rhodes. They were published by Colonel Rottiers in 1830. After that, he taught architecture, painting and design at the Jesuit college in Brugelette, in the province of Hainaut. This was followed by an appointment as the City Architect of Turnhout, where he also founded and directed a design academy. He married Marie-Antoinette van Haesendonck and they had twelve children; several of whom became painters, but of no particular note. His daughter, Marie-Th√©r√®se, married Colonel , a colonial administrator. He was especially interested in religious and historical subjects.

Before the Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies, he was the flag officer in command of the important naval base at Soerabaja. Biography Early career Pieter Koenraad was born in Dirksland, Netherlands, son of Johannes Adrianus Koenraad, head teacher, and Alida Elizabeth de Graaff. Koenraad started his training as a naval officer at the Royal Institute for the Navy in Den Helder in 1908. On 23 August 1911 he was appointed officer. He served first in the Dutch West Indies and then alternately between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies, both on shore and on board ships. In the East, he became successively commander of a torpedo boat hunter, then commander of the Oedjong Naval Barracks near Soerabaja, and finally commander of a division of torpedo boat hunters.http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1880-2000/lemmata/bwn1/koenraad Personal life From 1923 to 1930, Koenraad was married to Catharina Cornelia van Trooijen. The marriage ended in 1930, soon after the birth of their daughter. That same year, Koenraad married Gertrud Maria Eugelink, with whom he had two daughters, one of which would die young.http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1880-2000/lemmata/bwn1/koenraad World War II At the outbreak of the war with Japan, he was the Commander of an important naval base in Soerabaja. He realised the invasion of Java was just a matter of time, and started to prepare the evacuation of naval personnel to Ceylon or Australia. When the time came, there was more or less a plan ready for execution. Koenraad and his staff embarked on the submarine K-XII, which made it to Australia safely in March 1942,Michael Sturma (2015). Fremantle's Submarines: How Allied Submariners and Western Australians Helped Win the War in the Pacific. Naval Institute Press. p.14. and from there he left for England. Upon returning to Australia Koenraad replaced Rear-Admiral (Acting) F.W. Coster as Flag Officer in charge of all Dutch naval forces in the area. with headquarters in Melbourne, from 1 May 1943 to 1 October 1945; until November 1943 he was also Deputy Commander of Dutch East Indies Armed Forces. After having been temporarily promoted to Rear Admiral, this appointment became effective on 1 November 1943. From 6 October 1945 to 21 January 1946, Koenraad continued his task as the Acting Commander of the Navy in the Dutch East Indies, with its headquarters in Batavia. On 1 May 1946, he retired, being at the same time promoted to the honorary rank of Vice- admiral.http://www.netherlandsnavy.nl/Men_koenraad.htmTom Womack (2015). The Allied Defense of the Malay Barrier, 1941-1942. McFarland & Co Inc. p.76. Although Koenraad was not a particularly powerful military figure, in March 1942, during the evacuation of the navy from the Dutch East Indies, he acted independently and responsively, so that he and his naval staff were able to evade capture by the Japanese. In Australia his task was mostly administrative; the operational command over the Dutch naval units present being overseen by the Americans. The lack of communication with the Commander of the Dutch East Indies Armed Forces, Vice-admiral Helfrich in Colombo (Ceylon) did not facilitate his task. However Koenraad did not lack personal courage; more than once he participated in flights from Australia to the occupied Dutch East Indies.http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1880-2000/lemmata/bwn1/koenraad Post-war He died on 22 February 1968, at the age of 65, in Las Palmas, Canary Islands.http://www.netherlandsnavy.nl/Men_koenraad.htm Honors and awards * Order of the Netherlands Lion * Order of Orange-Nassau * Resistance Memorial Cross * Service Cross for naval officers, for 30 years of service * Mobilization Cross 1914‚Äì1918 * Officer in the Order of Nichan-Iftikhar of Tunis  References  Category:Royal Netherlands Navy personnel of World War II Category:1890 births Category:1968 deaths Category:People from Goeree- Overflakkee ","title":"Pieter Koenraad"},{"id":"62548563","text":"The new Hangzhou Great Mosque (Chinese: Êù≠Â∑û Ê∏ÖÁúüÂØ∫) is an Islamic-style mosque located in Hangzhou:., in Zhejiang Province.

It was formed following the collapse of the Rinne Cabinet and officially took office on 10 December 2019. The cabinet consists of a coalition formed by the Social Democratic Party, the Centre Party, the Green League, the Left Alliance, and the Swedish People's Party.  Ministers  Andersson, Kulmuni, Marin, Henriksson and Ohisalo The full cabinet on 10 December 2019 as Rinne resigns There are a total of 19 ministers in Marin's cabinet: seven ministers from the Social Democratic Party, five from the Centre Party, three from the Green League, and two each from the Left Alliance and Swedish People's Party. The composition mostly resembles that of the preceding Rinne Cabinet, although the former prime minister, Antti Rinne, does not have a position in the new government. The leader of the Centre Party, Katri Kulmuni, exchanged her Rinne-era portfolio as the Minister of Economic Affairs for the combined position of the Minister of Finance and the Minister deputising for the Prime Minister, switching places with Mika Lintil√§. The latter portfolio carries significant veto power over government finances, and its holder is effectively the government's second-in-command. This transfer solidified Kulmuni's position as the leader of the Centre Party ‚Äì a position which she had assumed only three months before the formation of Marin's government. Sirpa Paatero, the Social Democratic minister previously responsible for local government and ownership steering, was readmitted into the government despite her resignation from the Rinne Cabinet just days before. Ownership steering responsibilities were given to Tytti Tuppurainen, the Minister of European Affairs. SDP's Tuula Haatainen, the only new minister in Marin's government, took over as the Minister of Employment from Timo Harakka, and Harakka was given Sanna Marin's former portfolio of the Minister of Transport and Communications. All other portfolios were unchanged. The portfolio assignments as of September 2020 were: } Controversies Gender balance When the Marin Cabinet was formed, professor Anne Holli, a political scientist at the University of Helsinki, pointed out that the cabinet was deviating from the principle of gender equality, specifically the Finnish convention of each gender being represented by at least 40% of ministers: with 12 of the 19 ministers women, men accounted for only 37%. Prime Minister Marin responded to the criticism by explaining that with five parties in the coalition, and each party responsible for their own ministerial nominations, it was not always possible to coordinate things to the extent of ensuring gender balance. Repatriation of Al-Hawl refugees On 11 December 2019, all opposition parties filed a motion leading to a vote of no-confidence over repatriation of Finnish women and children from the Syrian Al-Hawl refugee camp. The motion followed criticism over the evasive statements on the issue by the government and the accusations that the Minister of Foreign Affairs Pekka Haavisto had supplied inaccurate information to the Parliament. Haavisto had rejected assertions that detailed plans existed to bring Finnish citizens home, while Finnish national broadcasting company Yle broke news about official documents stating otherwise. Haavisto was also accused of pushing through a plan to bring the children back to Finland without their mothers' consent by sidelining a top ministry official in the process. On 14 December 2019, Iltalehti released results of a survey in which 53% of people deemed Haavisto's actions wrong, while 32% saw them correct and 16% were unsure. On 18 December 2019, the parliament voted 110‚Äì79 in favor of Haavisto's confidence. On the following day, 10 MPs filed a notion to the Constitutional Law Committee to request an inspection into the actions of Haavisto. On 19 February 2020, the Constitutional Law Committee announced that it was requesting the Prosecutor General to start a preliminary investigation into Haavisto's actions. Minister of Finance Katri Kulmuni was further criticized over an Instagram poll, in which she asked whether to evacuate \\"children only\\" or \\"children and mothers\\" from the camp. After the post was panned by the public and representatives of human rights organizations, Kulmuni deleted the poll and apologized.

The rural representatives are responsible for electing the executive committees of their respective rural committees in which to elect the members of the Heung Yee Kuk. Background The Rural community in the New Territories has all the time had its own village representative elections. The previous electoral systems for a village or a group of villages came up around the end of World War II, in which they were conducted privately on a clan basis. All the candidates and electors were the indigenous inhabitants, ie person who could establish their patrilineal descent from a resident of a village that was in existence before the 1898 Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory. In 1994, the Heung Yee Kuk drew up a set of \\"Model Rules\\" for the elections of some 700 villages, which were held every four years. The appointment of the elected village representatives had to be approved by the Secretary for Home Affairs. The \\"Model rules\\" system prevailed until 1999 when two non-indigenous inhabitants, Chan Wah of Po Toi O in Sai Kung and Tse Kwan-sang of Shek Wu Tong in Yuen Long challenged the validity of the electoral arrangements in their villages by judicial review proceedings. Chan was denied the right to vote even though he married an indigenous inhabitants while Tse was denied the right to stand. The cases were eventually heard by the Court of Final Appeal in December 2000, which ruled that the electoral arrangements were inconsistent with the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance while those in Po Toi O were also inconsistent with the Sex Discrimination Ordinance. In view of the rulings, there were calls on the government to bring village representative elections under a statutory framework. In 2003, the government enacted the Village Representative Election Ordinance (Cap. 576), which was later renamed as Rural Representative Election Ordinance in 2014. In the proposal, the election would be held in a electoral system of two types of village representatives which represent both the indigenous and non-indigenous inhabitants. The Village Representative Election Ordinance (Cap. 576) was later renamed as Rural Representative Election Ordinance in 2014, which created a new type of kaifong representative which only were introduced in Cheung Chau and Peng Chau Rural Committee of the Islands District, for the electing non-village representatives to reflect views on local affairs on behalf of Cheung Chau and Peng Chau residents. Composition There are three different types of rural representatives. Under the village representatives, there are indigenous inhabitant representatives and resident representatives. Indigenous inhabitants are returned by the elector of indigenous inhabitants which have the exclusive power to deal with all affairs relating to traditional rights and interests of the indigenous villages, while resident representatives are to reflect view on behalf of the non-indigenous residents.

Hailing from Dublin, California, Damonte is one of the few domestic mid laners to have recently competed in North America's LCS, alongside other players like Goldenglue and Pobelter. He is particularly known for his mastery of the champion Qiyana.  Career   Echo Fox (2016‚Äì2018)  Damonte began playing League of Legends competitively in January 2015, competing in amateur leagues under the names \\"Mini\\" and \\"Mini Me\\". In February 2016 he joined his first major professional team, Echo Fox, as a substitute player. From July 2016 to June 2017, he played as the mid laner for Delta Fox, Echo Fox's academy team competing in the Challenger Series. Damonte made his LCS debut in May 2017, after he was promoted to a starting position in Echo Fox's main roster. However, he was moved back to the academy roster in December 2017, before once again being promoted to the main roster in July 2018 following a brief suspension for poor behaviour in online ranked matches.  Clutch Gaming (2019)  In November 2018 it was announced that Clutch Gaming had signed Damonte to a two-year contract to complete its starting roster for the 2019 spring split. Initially seeing disappointing results with a ninth- place finish in the 2019 LCS Spring regular season, Damonte and his teammates made a comeback in the summer split after replacing Piglet with Cody Sun in the bot lane. The team first secured a spot in the summer playoffs after defeating the Golden Guardians in a determining match, then they defeated TSM in the quarterfinals, before losing to Team Liquid in the semifinals. Due to being reverse swept by CLG in the third-place decider match, Clutch Gaming was forced to begin in the first round of the regional qualifier for the 2019 World Championship. After defeating FlyQuest, CLG and TSM in the first, second and third rounds respectively, Damonte qualified for his first World Championship, alongside his teammates. At the 2019 World Championship, Clutch Gaming began in the play-in stage as North America's third seed, only qualifying for the main event after defeating Turkish team Royal Youth in the second round of the play-in stage. Because of group draw rules for the main event, Clutch Gaming was forced into Group C, which was nicknamed the \\"group of death\\" due to it having three regional superteams: South Korea's SK Telecom T1, China's Royal Never Give Up, and Europe's Fnatic. Clutch Gaming finished last in their group and were eliminated without picking up a single win in the main event. In the off-season Clutch Gaming was merged with Dignitas and Damonte was transferred to Dignitas' new League of Legends roster. However, in November 2019 Damonte announced that Dignitas had decided not to exercise the second year option stipulated under his original contract with Clutch Gaming (which Dignitas had acquired), and that he had been released from the team.  Dignitas Academy (2020)  Dignitas announced on December 16, 2019 that it had signed Damonte to its academy team for the 2020 spring split. Dignitas Academy had a strong start to the spring split, maintaining first place throughout the first half of the regular season. However, the team was overtaken by Cloud9 Academy in the second half and finished second, earning them a bye to the semifinals where they lost to Evil Geniuses Academy.  Golden Guardians (2020)  On May 5, 2020, Damonte left Dignitas Academy to join Golden Guardians.  Personal life  Damonte grew up in Dublin, California and attended Dublin High School. In April 2020 he partnered with professional baseball player Hunter Pence as part of Verizon's \\"Pay It Forward Live\\" campaign to raise money for small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pair played a friendly match together on April 14.

The following is a list of characters introduced in 2020, by order of first appearance. All characters were introduced by executive producer, Bryan Kirkwood. January saw the introduction of Tony Hutchinson's (Nick Pickard) sister Verity (Eva O'Hara) and P.C. George Kiss (Callum Kerr). March saw the arrival of Mitchell Deveraux (Imran Adams), Toby Faroe (Bobby Gordon) and Celeste Faroe's (Andrea Ali) father, Felix Westwood (Richard Blackwood). Kyle Kelly's parents, Mark (Christopher Quinten) and Carole (Diana Weston) first appeared in May, while Sylver McQueen's (David Tag) secret daughter, Cher Winters (Bethannie Hare) and Jordan Price's (Connor Calland) drugs boss, Victor Brothers (Benjamin O'Mahoney) made their debuts in June. July saw the arrival of Cormac Ranger (James Gaddas) and Ripley Lennox (Ki Griffin). Additionally, multiple other characters appear throughout the year. Verity Hutchinson Verity Hutchinson, played by Eva O'Hara, made her first appearance on 6 January 2020, as part of Hollyoaks Later. The character was announced on 20 September 2019, but casting wasn't revealed until 10 December 2019. Verity is the sister of the soap's longest-running character Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard) and the daughter of Edward Hutchinson (Joe McGann). Verity is Edward's favourite child and arrives in the village to launch her own law firm. Describing the character, Eva said that she \\"can hold her own in any situation and really doesn't take no for an answer\\", adding: \\"She has a fascinating balance of ruthlessness and compassion, making her one to watch... I've found myself feeling jealous of her fearlessness at times.\\" Speaking about her casting, she said: \\"I have been totally bowled over by the wonderful team at Hollyoaks. I have fallen in love with the warmth and passion of everyone involved, and feel utterly blessed to be involved in such a creative environment.\\" George Kiss George Kiss, played by Callum Kerr, made his first appearance on 30 January 2020. The character and casting was announced on 20 January 2020. George is involved in a County lines drug trafficking storyline, and made his first appearance after Nancy Osborne (Jessica Fox) is stabbed at Hollyoaks High. Speaking about being part of the show, Kerr said: \\"I feel very honoured to be joining the cast of Hollyoaks during such a thrilling time for the show. My first couple of months have been brilliant and the cast and crew are very friendly and welcoming. My grandfather was a policeman like my character, so he'll be delighted to see me in the uniform. I'll be part of the team investigating the County Lines storyline, which will hopefully help raise awareness of a relevant topic and shed light on a serious issue.\\" Speaking further about the character's personality, Kerr said: \\"He'd be willing to risk his life, as long as the papers wrote about him afterwards and called him a 'hero cop'! I think he'd do anything. George is going to put himself in some dangerous situations when he should probably wait for back-up. But I think he loves the action and he is so passionate that he rushes in without thinking. George is very exciting as a new character. He's passionate and he loves his job. He loves being the saviour and being in the limelight. George loves the action of being a policeman, more so than the paperwork and the logistics. You'll see that he's quite flirty, he's very friendly with everyone and he has got a really exciting storyline.\\" He continued, saying: \\"My first scenes come when Nancy has just been stabbed in the playground after an altercation and the police are called. George is the first officer on the scene, but the paramedics are already there. He has to try to understand what's going on very quickly. George takes control of the situation immediately. It's a really nice way to be introduced, showing him as someone who's trustworthy and who can take control of a dangerous situation. I think there'll be a lot of those, over the course of the next year. So far my scenes have been with the teachers at the school. I have shared scenes with Nancy, Sally, John Paul, and then a few of the worried parents as well. I've also been with DS Cohen a few times. She's my boss and she's very good at her job, so George is keen to impress! You'll see that George is a police officer for the right reasons and his heart is in it. He wants to make sure this village, and the kids in it, are safe from the dangers that come from drug dealing and drug trafficking.\\"\\" Felix Westwood Felix Westwood, played by Richard Blackwood, made his first appearance on 30 March 2020. The character was announced on 24 January 2020, while speculation about Blackwood being cast on the show started on 23 January 2020 after he was spotted on set. Felix is a past love interest of Martine Deveraux (K√©ll√© Bryan), and is the father of Mitchell Deveraux (Imran Adams), Toby Faroe (Bobby Gordon) and Celeste Faroe (Andrea Ali). On 3 February 2020 co-star Jamie Lomas who plays Warren Fox announced the character Felix is a face from Warren's past. On his casting, Blackwood said: \\"I feel amazed and honoured to join the cast of Hollyoaks. After finishing at EastEnders, I did a few plays and a TV show for America. Now, I feel ready with what I've learnt in my hiatus to be a part of this show. I plan to take my acting to the next level and this character will help tremendously with that growth!\\" Blackwood's casting was also praised by Adams, who said: \\"He's such a charming, personable, hardworking guy and I feel like, because of those attributes, he will be a perfect fit in the Deveraux clan who are loved by so many Hollyoaks fans. It's great to see such an iconic show have such diversity, and I know that Hollyoaks will continue to be the leader with that topic and I'm grateful to have him on board.\\" Adams later added that Felix would be a bit of a bad boy, saying: \\"He is going to be a bad boy. But I think he's going to be one of the bad boys who goes down in the Hollyoaks history books. He will definitely shake things up and I can't wait to work with him, to be honest.\\" Appearing on Good Morning Britain before his character's debut, Blackwood explained his character's past, saying that Felix is quite a \\"dark character.\\" He added: \\"You'll find through the story there's things that have happened that conditioned him to be the way that he is. He's a bit desensitised from emotion in that sense. When he interacts with people, you can see that. You've got to play the truth of why they became that way. What Hollyoaks has done, which I think is beautiful, is they've gone into the history of why he has become that way.\\" Felix first arrives in the village after he receives a call from Celeste who pretends to be her long-lost mother, Felix's ex-girlfriend, Martine. He arrives in the village in a BMW and flirts with Grace Black (Tamara Wall) and Diane Hutchinson (Alex Fletcher) after splashing Grace and ruining her expensive hells. He offers Sienna Blake (Anna Passey) help as she is struggling to get out a taxt, but she refuses. He arrives at the Deverauxes' front door where his son, Mitchell, and his boyfriend Scott Drinkwell (Ross Adams) are having an argument with his other son Toby, Celeste, Martine, their grandfather Walter Deveraux (Trevor A. Toussaint) and their cousin Lisa Loveday (Rachel Adedeji). Mark Kelly Mark Kelly, played by Christopher Quinten, made his first appearance on 14 April 2020. The character and casting was announced on 11 February 2020. Mark is the father of established character Kyle Kelly (Adam Rickitt), and the husband of fellow newcomer, Carole Kelly (Diana Weston). On Coronation Street, Quinten had played the role of Brian Tilsley, the father of Rickitt's then character, Nick Tilsley, although the pair never met during the others run on the soap. In a statement about the characters, Rickitt said: \\"This is one of the more surreal experiences of my career. After 23 years, I finally get to meet my first onscreen dad, which is truly bizarre. It's an honour to have such well- established actors like Chris and Diana come in to play my parents and I've really enjoyed the scenes we've filmed so far. Plus at least having parents in the show means Kyle has an excuse to regress into adolescence, which comes quite easily to him.\\" Speaking about joining the show, Quinten said: \\"I've thoroughly enjoyed the scenes I've filmed so far at Hollyoaks, I already love the show and all of the cast, crew and production staff are fantastic and so friendly. Working with Adam after first playing 'his' dad more than thirty years ago is a dream come true, it's a brilliant piece of soap nostalgia, which I hope everyone enjoys.\\" Carole Kelly Carole Kelly, played by Diana Weston, made her first appearance on 14 April 2020. The character and casting was announced on 11 February 2020. Carole is the mother of established character Kyle Kelly (Rickitt), and the wife of fellow newcomer Mark Kelly (Quinten). Cher Winters Cher Winters, played by Bethannie Hare, made her first appearance on 1 June 2020. The character and casting was announced on 12 April 2020. Cher is the daughter of established character Sylver McQueen (David Tag), although before her arrival, he is unaware of her existence. Cher is an aspiring hairdresser and beautician who is set to inject some \\"fun and energy into the village.\\" Cher is described as the \\"life and soul of the party\\" with \\"strong family values and is ready to learn more about her father\\" as all she currently knows about him is that he's a convicted murderer. On joining the show, Hare said: \\"Everyone's been so nice. It is like a little family. I was nervous coming in, and everyone has just put me at ease. I‚Äôm absolutely loving it. I feel like I am learning so much from other cast members every day as well.\\" She added that her character was \\"very sassy! She definitely has an attitude, but she's also caring and she‚Äôs so big on family, just like the McQueens. She'll always be there for someone. I‚Äôm so excited to join the McQueen family.\\" Cher arrives to the village, searching for her father, Sylver, and watches him, Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe) and Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas) from afar. She attends Sylver and Mercedes' vow renewal ceremony, assuming Warren is Sylver, where she privately tells him that she's his daughter. Warren informs her that he was in prison when she was conceived, insisting he is not her father. When Goldie McQueen (Chelsee Healey) offers her a place to stay, she privately approaches Sylver, asking for ¬£3,000 and then she will leave. Sylver agrees to get her the money, but she declines it as she wants to have the opportunity to get to know him better. Cher's mother, Kelly Winters (Jenny Wickham), arrives and informs her that she and her other children are moving to Greece without Cher. Romeo Quinn (Owen Warner) becomes smitten with Cher and tries to ask her out on a date, but she rejects him. When he gives Cher his number, she rejects him again and returns it to him. When a doll is delivered to the McQueen family threatening to reveal the family's secrets, Cher discovers that Sylver murdered Breda McQueen (Moya Brady). In return, she reveals that she accidentally murdered her half-sister Liza, due to being jealous of how much attention Kelly gave to her. Victor Brothers Victor Brothers, played by Benjamin O'Mahoney, made his first appearance on 16 June 2020. The character and casting was announced on 7 April 2020. Victor is the boss of drugdealer Jordan Price (Connor Calland), and is said to be the man behind the County Line drug operation. Calland teased that Victor's arrival will mean that Jordan is \\"not the nastiest person in the village anymore.\\" Victor has been described as enigmatic and \\"complex\\" with O'Mahoney saying of his character: \\"Victor is (arguably) a sociopath, who is willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants ‚Äì comfortable with manipulating and exploiting vulnerable children to build himself the empire he thinks he deserves. I would argue that Victor sees himself as an efficient businessman working within a violent industry, but there is also another side to him that is addicted to the power and loves to see the fear in people's eyes.\\" Cormac Ranger Cormac Ranger, played by James Gaddas, made his first appearance on 7 July 2020. Cormac is the former carer of Warren Fox (Lomas) and Felix Westwood (Blackwood) who worked in a children's home. The character was mentioned prior to his arrival, with Warren talking about his troubled childhood in care, stating that Cormac was kind to him and that he taught Warren how to box. Cormac is introduced as part of an historic abuse storyline when Felix claims that Cormac abused him during his stay in the children's home because of his race. It was stated that \\"Cormac is set to kick start one of Hollyoaks biggest storylines of the year.\\" Ripley Lennox Ripley Lennox, played by Ki Griffin, made their first appearance on 20 July 2020. Ripley is a stall-owner at the Cunningham's Grand Bazaar, and in their first appearance they attempt to help Yasmine Maalik (Haiesha Mistry) out of Tom Cunningham (Ellis Hollins) buying her a jumper she doesn't like by lying about the price. However, Tom still buys the item at the inflated price. No announcement was made of Ripley's casting, but it was announced on 9 August of that year, that they were part of the regular cast. Alongside Tom and Yasmine, Ripley will strike up friendships with Peri Lomax (Ruby O'Donnell) and Romeo Quinn (Owen Warner). Summer Ranger Summer Ranger, played by Rhiannon Clements will make her first appearance in November 2020. The character and casting was announced on 19 October 2020. Summer is the daughter of Cormac Ranger (Gaddas), and arrives in the village after he falls into a coma on account of being assaulted by Warren Fox (Lomas). After arriving in the village, Summer will set up a baking business in the Grande Bazaar. A Hollyoaks spokesperson said that Summer was \\"angelic on the outside, but a mischievous minx on the inside.\\" They added that Summer was also \\"a bright, effortlessly cool tomboy, but when she wants something, she's capable of going to extreme lengths to get it,\\" and teased that she'd be a \\"frenemy\\" to Sienna in both her life and love. On her casting and character, Rhiannon said: \\"I was absolutely buzzing and really grateful in our current climate to get the opportunity to join the Hollyoaks family. Summer is fun, sarcastic and I love the zest she brings. She's all sweetness and light but she also has a nasty bite, which is going to be brilliant to play. Once Summer sets her mind on something, be it an idea, a plan or a person, she will do everything she can to make things go her way. Also, I'm incredibly jealous of her wardrobe!\\" Other characters { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"font- size:95%\\" + List of other 2020 characters ! scope=\\"col\\"  Character ! scope=\\"col\\"  Episode(s) ! scope=\\"col\\"  Original broadcast date(s) ! scope=\\"col\\"  Actor ! scope=\\"col\\"  Details - ! scope=\\"row\\"   5336    A doctor at the Winter Ball that Edward Hutchinson (Joe McGann) flirts with in order to make Diane Hutchinson (Alex Fletcher) jealous. - ! scope=\\"row\\"   5339, 5365  , (2 episodes)   A therapist who talks to Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard), Sylver McQueen (David Tag) and Jack Osborne (Jimmy McKenna) following the death of Breda McQueen (Moya Brady).

The club has a prominent place in Greater St. Louis music history. It is best known for being the club where teenaged Tina Turner met her future husband, bandleader Ike Turner. The building was destroyed by fire in 2010.  History  In 1954, Ike Turner moved his band, the Kings of Rhythm, from Clarksdale to East St. Louis. There he met a man named Booker Merritt who owned a brick building on Broadway. Turner and his band gut renovated the building and created the Manhattan Club where they would practice and perform. The Manhattan Club was initially a predominately African-American club. Turner also played at the white clubs in St. Louis such as the Club Imperial, and soon gained a large following from white teenagers. Turner's competition in the St. Louis club scene was musician Chuck Berry who once brought bluesman Muddy Waters to watch Turner perform. Other musicians who performed at the Manhattan Club include Little Milton, Oliver Sain, and Albert King. Tina Turner (then called Ann Bullock) recalled that she \\"almost went into a trance\\" when she first saw Ike Turner perform at the Manhattan Club. One night in 1957, she was given the microphone by his drummer Eugene Washington during an intermission and she sang the B.B. King blues ballad, \\"You Know I Love You.\\" Impressed by her voice, Turner added her as a featured vocalist with his Kings of Rhythm; they later formed the duo Ike & Tina Turner. East St. Louis poet laureate Eugene Redmond recalled that in the 1950s Tina Turner was a \\"teeny- bopper and a groupie.\\" She used to hang around the Manhattan while Turner was practicing. Turner's band was very popular and he had a strong following of female admirers. Redmond gave him the nickname \\"Ike Turner, the Woman Burner\\" because he was \\"known to run through women.\\" Tina Turner later wrote a song titled \\"Club Manhattan,\\" on the Ike & Tina Turner album Nutbush City Limits, as homage to the Manhattan Club. In 1967, Albert King was performing at the Manhattan Club when promoter Bill Graham offered him $1,600 to play three nights at the Fillmore West in San Francisco. The club had various names changes over the years, but was last known as the Four Aces. In later years, it housed a liquor store in the front and a bar in the back. The other half of the building was a club. The Disco Riders, a 32-member motorcycle club, owned and operated the club, and on Saturday nights hosted dance parties. The building was vacant when it was destroyed by a fire in 2010.

Morello is the head of the Fundamental Quantum Technologies Laboratory at UNSW.  Education  Morello completed his undergraduate degree in electrical engineering at the Politecnico di Torino in Italy in 1998. His research career began at the Grenoble High Magnetic Field Laboratory where he investigated the magnetic phase diagram of high T_c superconductors. He obtained his PhD in experimental physics from the Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratory in Leiden in 2004, during which he explored the quantum dynamics of molecular nanomagnets at low temperatures. Morello spent two years at the University of British Columbia before joining UNSW Sydney in 2006.  Research  Morello's research is primarily focused on designing and building the basic components of a quantum computer using the spins of single atoms in silicon. His team were the first in the world to demonstrate the coherent control and readout of the electron and nuclear spin of an individual phosphorus atom in silicon, and for many years they held the record for the longest quantum memory time for a single qubit in the solid state (35.6 seconds). Morello's research also focuses on using highly coherent spin systems to study the foundations of quantum mechanics.  Outreach  Outside of his research Morello is actively engaged in science outreach and education. He has produced a series of YouTube videos 'The Quantum Around You' and 'Quantum Computing Concepts' to bring the fundamental concepts of quantum physics to a wider audience. Morello also starred in a series of videos produced by YouTuber Derek Muller on his channel Veritasium, explaining the fundamental concepts of quantum computing, with the highest viewed video in this series being watched over 3.4 million times.

He is a researcher in neurobiology.  Biography  Antoine Triller has a medical background at the university hospital centre of La Piti√© Salpetri√®re (1978). In Jean Scherrer's laboratory, he turned to neurophysiology and initiated research work on inhibitory synapses with Henri Korn, a specialist in the field. In 1979, he was recruited as a research associate at Inserm. In 1985, he obtained his PhD in science. In 1995, he joined the Biology Department of the √âcole normale sup√©rieure where he was in charge of a team. He then created his research unit entitled \\"Cell Biology of the Synapse\\" in 1998. In 2010, he created the Institut de Biologie de l'√âcole normale sup√©rieure, of which he is the director. This institute is the result of the grouping of all biology within the department. Since 2011, he has also been Director of the MemoLife Laboratory of Excellence, whose biology, physics and mathematics teams address memory processes, from genes to neural networks and the mechanisms of evolution. Antoine Triller is the winner of several prizes, including the Inserm prize for \\"Physiology and Physiopathology\\" in 2004 and the Lamonica Prize of the French Academy of sciences in 2010. He was elected a member of the French Academy of sciences in 2011. He has been President of the Union rationaliste de France since 2019.  Scientific work  It was by working on the Mauthner cell (en), a model used in the 1980s to study the quantum release mechanisms of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system, that Antoine Triller began to focus on the intimate mechanisms of synapses and the molecules that compose them. It works on the development of technological approaches in partnership with physicists. They make it possible to characterize certain structural parameters of quantum release.H. Korn, A. Triller, A. Mallet, D. S. Faber, \\"Fluctuating Responses at a Central Synapse - N of Binomial Fit Predicts Number of Stained Presynaptic Boutons\\" Science 213 (4510), 1981, 898-901 As early as 1985, he was able to visualize the glycine receptor in the synapses of the central nervous system by electron microscopy and show that neurotransmitter receptors are concentrated in front of the synaptic vesicle release zones.A. Triller, F. Cluzeaud, F. Pfeiffer, H. Betz, H. Korn \\"Distribution of glycine receptors at central synapses: an immunoelectron microscopy study\\" J Cell Biol, 101 (2), 1985, 683-688 This work has been used as a model to locate most channels and receptors, such as glutamate receptors. Antoine Triller demonstrated the possibility of a co- transmission involving two conventional transmitters, glycine and GABA. By creating his laboratory at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure de la rue d'Ulm in 1995, he reoriented his activities towards the study of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control the recruitment and trafficking of receptors in the synapse. Antoine Triller studied GABA and glycine receptors in particular.J. Meier, C. Vannier, A. Serge, A. Triller, D. Choquet, ¬´ ¬ª Nat Neurosci, 4 (3), 2001, 253-260J. Kirsch, I. Wolters, A. Triller, H. Betz, 366 (6457), 1993, 745-748 He showed that the nature of the pre-synaptic neurotransmitter determined the type of receptor accumulating in the post synaptic density. In addition, using electron microscopy, he was able to demonstrate the presence of messenger RNAs encoding the glycine receptor in dendrites. In 2003, in partnership with physicists, he developed the use of \\"quantum dots\\" for cellular neurobiology. This technological advance makes it possible to move from static imaging of molecules to a very high resolution dynamic approach. It is the subject of a founding article in ScienceM. Dahan, S.

The building is listed as Grade II, Number: 1079376. Outside the building is Romanesque. The old medieval church was demolished in 1720 and a new church opened in 1740, design by James Horne. The current church was designed by the architect S.S.Teulon, who enlarged and redecorated the earlier Georgian church, between 1865-1873, giving it the appearance of a Greek Byzantine basilica. The new building was consecrated in 1866 by Bishop Tait, the Bishop of London, who praised Teulon's alterations at St. Mary's, Ealing, as \\"the transformation of a Georgian monstrosity into the semblance of a Byzantine Basilica\\". A vestry was added in 1887, the organ enlarged in 1927, further redecoration in the 1950s and 'The Polygon' created in 1978. Further restoration was completed in 2003. The church contains a good collection of Victorian stained glass windows that were commissioned by Thomas Boddington, who lived at Gunnersbury Lodge, in 1864-74. Old wall tablets and a medieval brass to Richard and Kateryn Amondesham (c.1490) were retained from the old church. The marble and Caen stone reredos was adorned with Salviati mosaics. There is a memorial to John Horne Tooke (d 1812) by Louis Frederick Roslyn and a modern brass to Walrond Jackson, Bishop of Antigua, who died in Ealing in 1895.

A total of seven people were killed in the attack, and two others were injured.https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3003119-utok-v-ostrave-ma-sedmou- obet-tezce-zranena-zena-zemrela The illegally armed perpetrator, 42-year-old Ctirad Vit√°sek, left the scene before the arrival of police and committed suicide as police closed in on him later during the day. Vit√°sek had three previous criminal convictions, including one for a violent crime, and a previous hospitalization in a psychiatric ward.  Attack  Vit√°sek entered the hospital in the early morning and wandered through its hallways. He briefly stopped at the cardiology waiting room and then at the gastroenterology waiting room, both of which were almost empty. He then entered the traumatology waiting room on the third floor of the hospital building at around 7:15 a.m. There were about thirty people in the room, all of them either partially immobile (on a wheelchair or with a limb in splint) or accompanying a partially immobile family member. Vit√°sek first crossed through the waiting room towards the doctor's office, however the doors there were still locked. He rattled the locked doors, but his apparent attempt to open them failed. He then stood quietly with an illegal CZ 75B pistol in one hand in a low position by his leg. He raised the pistol to his own head for a few seconds, but did not pull the trigger. Several witnesses expressed regret that there had not been anyone legally armed inside to stop Vit√°sek at that moment. After this, Vit√°sek opened fire on the people inside. After firing three shots, his weapon jammed. According to an eyewitness, it was clear that Vit√°sek was not practiced in using a gun. It took him about five seconds to clear the malfunction. He was visibly shaking and loudly gritting his teeth. After clearing the malfunction, Vit√°sek continued to shoot people in the room, aiming at victims' heads and necks, killing six adults. Two of the victims were off-duty prison guards, one with a leg in a splint and the other accompanying his minor daughter. A third victim in the waiting room also had law enforcement training, having left the prison service ten years prior. At the time of the attack, all three were unarmed. Three other people sustained injuries, one of them dying several days later. When first responders arrived, Vit√°sek had already escaped the scene.  Police response  Police received the first emergency call at 7:19 a.m. and the first police unit reached the location of the incident five minutes later. By the time they arrived Vit√°sek had already left the hospital. All Czech policemen are armed with pistols and a typical patrol car includes two policemen who usually have at least one select-fire rifle (HK MP5, MP7 or G36) in the trunk, as well as bullet proof vests. Aside from these general purpose patrols Czech police also have a system of special \\"first order\\" patrol cars, whose two policemen have heavy body armor, a select-fire rifle each, and extensive active killer training. The first order patrol cars are positioned so as to reach any similar incident within ten minutes anywhere in the country and thus overcome the delay needed for the arrival of a complete tactical team. Vit√°sek drove away from the hospital in a grey Renault Laguna, at some point taking down its registration plates, possibly to avoid detection by automatic traffic cameras. Three hours later, Vit√°sek arrived at his parents' house in Jile≈°ovice, from the hospital. There he confessed to the crime and told his mother that he was going to kill himself. His mother called the police and informed them about her son being the perpetrator, his whereabouts and a description of his car. By this time the police had arrested eight men in the hospital, its vicinity and elsewhere in Ostrava who fit the initial general description of Vit√°sek, which later turned out to be completely wrong. Vit√°sek's car was found by a helicopter shortly after his mother's call in Dƒõhylov. As ground units closed in, he self-inflicted a gunshot wound to his head. Although he was initially conscious and communicated with first responders, he succumbed to his injury after 30 minutes of resuscitation attempts. Possible motive Vit√°sek's family and friends had observed his mental state gradually deteriorating over a long period of time. According to them his mental state significantly worsened about three months before the attack. Vit√°sek became obsessed with a belief that he suffered from a fatal illness, possibly pancreatic cancer. However, numerous hospital visits and detailed examinations ruled this possibility out. Vit√°sek was seeking further medical examinations while on sick leave from work about a month before the attack. During one medical examination, Vit√°sek's partner told the doctor to issue a request for psychiatric evaluation, claiming that he had become \\"impossible to live with\\". She stated that Vit√°sek was convinced that he would die imminently, often breaking down and crying. Although a psychiatric evaluation was arranged, Vit√°sek did not go through with it. Instead, he sought further examination for cancer. Vit√°sek had spent some time in a psychiatric ward two years before the attack following hospitalisation for tetany, which is often accompanied by depression. Origin of murder weapon Vit√°sek had three previous criminal convictions, including one for a violent crime. He had also been hospitalized in a psychiatric ward. Both of these factors rendered him ineligible to legally possess a firearm in the Czech Republic. Vit√°sek used a CZ 75 pistol that was made about 30 years before as a non-functional cut-away replica for purposes of education and training. This free-to-buy cutaway was later illegally modified to full functionality. Police experts had not encountered a similar conversion of a cut-away before and noted that it was done in a very sophisticated way. Nevertheless, the firearm jammed at least once during the attack.

Schoolfield of Yale University, with Scandinavian Studies and The American-Scandinavian Review, as part of the \\"literatures of the North\\". It was part of an expansion in Nordic studies in Russia and the Soviet republics that saw departments of Nordic studies established in many universities and institutions in the Soviet region after the Second World War. Its philosophy was to emphasise long-term historical processes and periods of peace over warfare, arguing that peaceful coexistence among nations and peoples was the most natural order of things. In a review of the first two volumes in 1959, Russian historian I. P. Shaskol'skii welcomed the journal, saying in –í–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å—ã –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ (Questions of History) that it brought a Marxist- Leninist approach to the history of the Scandinavian countries to which Soviet historical scholarship had previously paid little attention, leaving many fundamental questions open, such as establishing when the feudal system in Scandinavia transitioned to the capitalist system and when a class society emerged. The emphasis on peaceful periods was needed as Soviet scholarship had formerly focused mainly on Russian wars with the Swedes, thus neglecting the internal economic and social development of the Scandinavian countries. In Shaskol'skii's opinion, the Marxist-Leninist approach enabled breakthroughs in solving problems that had defeated bourgeois historians, such as the ownership of peasant lands in Norway. He also noted the extensive use made by authors of archival material, in Russia and outside, that had not previously been examined by Soviet scholars, and the frequency with which contributors addressed questions of historiography and interpretation.\\"–°–ö–ê–ù–î–ò–ù–ê–í–°–ö–ò–ô –°–ë–û–†–ù–ò–ö\\", –í–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å—ã –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏, No. 12 (December 1959), pp. 159-166. Scandinavian specialist Ernst Ekman of the University of California wrote that Swedish historians had been more interested in relations with Germany than with Russia and that therefore it had fallen to Russian historians to highlight relations with Sweden, particularly in respect of Russian support for Sweden during the Thirty Years' War, saying in reference to Skandinavskii sbornik that \\"the whole existence of a special journal for Soviet specialists on Scandinavia is an indication of their interest in this\\". In 1965, after the Soviet regime eased censorship as part of a process of de-Stalinization, the name of railway engineer Yury Lomonosov appeared in Skandinavskii sbornik and other publications considered to have a specialist audience, after years of his existence being suppressed. In 1970, Finnish historian Erkki Kuujo reviewed the output of the journal from 1956 to volume 24 in 1979 in two articles for the Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr Geschichte Osteuropas (Yearbooks for the History of Eastern Europe) in which he noted that despite the publication's claims for international collaboration, the majority of the authors were from the Soviet Union, the choice of flags for the cover revealing which countries were counted among the Nordic ones. Like Shaskol'skii, Kuujo noted authors referencing archives throughout the Soviet Union, for instance in Tartu and Riga, not just in Moscow.\\"Skandinavskij sbornik.

Heinz E. Ellersieck of the California Institute of Technology wrote in 1974 that the historians of Skandinavskii sbornik developed the idea of the \\"friendly frontier\\" as part of their mission to \\"develop and strengthen 'the friendly connections between the peoples of the Soviet Union and their nearest neighbors in the northwest' \\", a process that began with the publication of an article by Boris Porshnev about Russian friendship with Sweden during the Thirty Years' War. Later articles backtracked somewhat to restate Russia's legitimate claims for western expansion. Apart from history, the journal also covered economics, law, philosophy and the wider humanities, such as linguistics and the runic alphabets and inscriptions of Scandinavia such as the runic wand from Staraja Ladoga in north-west Russian,\\"Ob otkrytii v Staroi Ladoge runiƒçeskoj nadpisi na dereve v 1950 godu.\\" by V.

It is equivalent to a broad circumscription of the genus Lycopodium in other classifications. Like all lycophytes, members of the Lycopodioideae reproduce by spores. Description The sporophytes of Lycopodioideae species are relatively short herbaceous plants. They have stems with pseudomonopodial branching in which unequal binary branching produces the appearance of a main stem with secondary side branches. The main stems are indeterminate and of various forms, including rhizomatous, creeping, trailing and climbing. They usually form roots at intervals along their length. The branches are usually determinate (i.e. of limited growth and extension). Sporangia are borne at the bases or in the axils of special spore-bearing leaves (sporophylls), which are notably different from the normal leaves, and are usually grouped into compact terminal structures (strobili). The strobili may be either upright or drooping. Taxonomy The family Lycopodiaceae was first established in 1802. Although other genera now placed within the family (in particular Huperzia, published in 1801) had been described, until the mid-1900s, Lycopodium was often the only genus recognized. Work by Josef Holub and Benjamin √òllgaard in the 1980s established three clear divisions within the family. This has since been supported by molecular phylogenetic studies. Several different ways of representing this situation taxonomically have been used, and are still in use , including three subfamilies with multiple genera, and three genera with multiple subgeneric divisions. Three subfamilies, including Lycopodioideae, were first suggested by Warren Wagner, Jr. and Joseph Beitel in 1992, but were not validly published under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature as it was then. The names were validated by Benjamin √òllgaard in 2015. The entire subfamily Lycopodioideae in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I) corresponds to the single genus Lycopodium in other classifications. Phylogeny Within the family Lycopodiaceae, there is support for three subgroups. In 2016, Field et al. proposed that the primary division is between Lycopodielloideae plus Lycopodioideae (which comprised their Lycopodioideae) and Huperzioideae (subfamilies sensu PPG I). Field et al. (2016) included 22 species of Lycopodioideae in their analysis, which suggested the relationships among the genera shown in the following cladogram, where the number of species included in the study is shown in parentheses: Genera In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I) the Lycopodioideae has the following genera: *Austrolycopodium Holub *Dendrolycopodium A.Haines *Diphasiastrum Holub *Diphasium C.Presl ex Rothm. *Lycopodiastrum Holub ex R.D.Dixit *Lycopodium L. *Pseudodiphasium Holub *Pseudolycopodium Holub *Spinulum A.Haines All of these genera are submerged into a single genus Lycopodium sensu lato in other systems of classification.

History An international Ananda Marga group singing a Kirtan on the occasion of Shrii Shrii Anandamurti's liberation. Italy, 1978. The organisation uses asanas alongside mudras, pranayama, and other practices of Patanjali's ashtanga yoga. A pioneer of modern yoga as exercise in Italy was Vanda Scaravelli (1908-1999), author of the \\"classic\\" 1991 book Awakening the spine. Another pioneer, Carlo Patrian (1930-2008), began studying yoga in 1950 and founded the yoga institute that still bears his name in Milan in 1965. In the 21st century, yoga is growing steadily in Italy, and the International Day of Yoga (21 June) is celebrated across the country each summer. By 2017 there were some 830 recognised yoga schools in the country. The 2018 Coop report (compiled by Nielsen in 2017) stated that 11% of the women of Italy and 3% of the men practiced yoga or Pilates; 32% of those consulted said they intended to practice in future. Among the forms of yoga in Italy are hybrids such as aerial yoga and Acroyoga. Italy is a popular destination for yoga tourism, with yoga retreats and holidays taught in various languages. Regulation By 2019, yoga teacher training was still not regulated in Italy despite the country's 3 million yoga practitioners, resulting, according to Bianca Carati writing in La Stampa, in excessively \\"accelerated\\" courses, some taking as little as 2 months to deliver 150 hours of training at a cost between ‚Ç¨1500 and ‚Ç¨3000. Carati reported that the Associazione Italiana Iyengar yoga considered this inadequate; it required at least 3 years of training. It, along with the Associazione Italiana Insegnanti Yoga and the Associazione Yoga Satyananda, has created a set of proposed standards for yoga teacher training in Italy, requiring at least 500 hours of training over a period of at least four years, and to have taught for at least four years.

However, the first two printed versions of the play exhibit differences in the relevant passage. Thus textual criticism can lead to a variety of interpretations: {  - ! Variorum !! Quarto (1622) !!

Premise  The series follows six potential guide dogs named Paco, Pacino, Raffi, Amara, Tulane, and Tartan and how they are nurtured, trained, loved, and shepherded along the way forward potentially changing a blind human companion‚Äôs life and working as their guide dog. Episodes  Production  In August 2019, Kidscreen reported that Disney+ commissioned a six part series Pick of the Litter inspired by 2018 film of the same name attaching the film's writer-directors Dana Nachman and Don Hardy along with Mary Celenza, Josh Braun and Dan Braun as executive producers with ABC Studios producing the series. Shortly after the trailer for the film released, Disney put out an idea to adapt the film into a series and the negotiations began for making the series. When the idea about this series is pitched to Chris Beginner, CEO of Guide dogs for Blind he accepted as it would make more people aware about their organisation. Instead of doing again the same thing what they did with the feature, the directing duo decided focus on the period of the transition from getting the puppies from puppy raiser homes to twelve weeks of training they undergo for becoming a guide dog by focusing on specific litter. As the production doesn't want to disturb the training process, they used smaller camera on a gimbal that then goes into a monopod that can be flipped upside down. Another challenge they had faced is if the puppy raisers will be willing to open their homes for the documentary.https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/pick- of-the-litter-disney-plus-docuseries-film-continuation-don-hardy-guide-dogs- for-the-blind-1203445359/  Release  The first episode premiered on Disney+ on December 20, 2019 with the following episodes debuting weekly on Fridays.

He played college basketball with the Miami Dade Sharks and the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors. Cross was selected in the 1987 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers but never played in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He instead played professionally in the American Continental Basketball Association (CBA) and in France, Spain and Turkey. Cross is the most recent player from the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors to be selected in an NBA draft. College career Cross emerged as a promising prospect while playing at South Plantation High School in Plantation, Florida, and received multiple scholarship offers from NCAA Division I colleges. However, he was not initially academically eligible and instead played his first two seasons of college basketball with the Miami Dade Sharks. During his sophomore season, he was selected to the All-State Team and named by Basketball Weekly as being among the top junior college transfer candidates. In 1986, Cross was offered a scholarship by the University of Hawaii at Manoa, who had first attempted to recruit him during his high school career. He was required to spend the 1986‚Äì87 season at Leeward Community College while not playing basketball to become academically eligible for Hawaii. Cross financially supported himself while taking classes by working full-time as a courier for a legal firm. Cross made his debut for the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors during the 1987‚Äì88 season, and averaged 15.7 points per game. During his senior season in 1988‚Äì89, Cross led Hawaii to its first postseason bid since 1974 while averaging 18.6 points per game. Cross was subsequently selected to the All-WAC First Team, while he was named as Hawaii's most outstanding player during both of his seasons with the team. He gained further attention from NBA teams following a promising showing at an All-Star Game in Japan and earned invites to multiple NBA tryout camps. Professional career Cross was selected in the 1989 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers as the 44th overall pick. He was waived by the 76ers on October 19, 1989. Cross spent the 1990 season in the Continental Basketball Association, splitting his season between the Grand Rapids Hoops and the Yakima Sun Kings. At the end of the 1990 CBA season, Cross joined the Orlando Magic for training camp but did not make the team's final roster. He spent part of the 1990‚Äì91 season playing in Spain with the Grupo IFA Granollers, replacing Tom Sheehey. After a stint in France playing for Le Mans Sarthe during the 1991‚Äì92 season, Cross returned to the United States in 1992 to play for the Palm Beach Stingrays of the United States Basketball League (USBL) and the Columbus Horizon of the CBA. Following the conclusion of the CBA season, he joined the Washington Bullets for training camp but missed time with the team due to an illness in his family. In June 1993 he played for the Winnipeg Thunder of the Canadian National Basketball League after having been part of the Montreal Dragons roster. He spent three consecutive seasons playing in Turkey from 1993 to 1996. Personal life Cross' first child, a daughter, was born while he was attending Miami Dade. He married the child's mother, Gwenell, in 1986. His second child, a son, was born during his first season at Hawaii.

He learned that young Midshipman Philip Spencer (1823-1842) was plotting a mutiny that would kill all the officers and most of the trainees and become a very fast, well-armed pirate ship. This happened in the middle of the Atlantic and no help was nearby. He had Spencer arrested and all the officers agreed that to save the ship they had to immediately execute Spencer and his two co-conspirators. The three were executed without a court martial and the ship returned safely to New York. However Spencer's father was the powerful United States Secretary of War John C. Spencer who tried to destroy Mackenzie. An inquiry and a court martial both cleared Mackenzie. There was enormous public attention, most of it unfavorable to Mackenzie. It was the last mutiny in the United States Navy.Samuel Eliot Morison, \\"Old Bruin\\": Commodore Matthew C. Perry, 1794-1858 (1967) pp 144-62. Recently the plotters have been compared to modern-day school shooters.Buckner Melton, A Hanging Offense: The Strange Affair of the Warship Somers (2007) p 261. This Lithograph, published circa 1843, shows the mutineers hanging under the US flag. Plotting On 25 November 1842, during the passage to the West Africa and back Midshipman Philip Spencer, the son of Secretary of War John C. Spencer, tried to enlist purser's steward J.W. Wales in a planned mutiny by approximately 20 of Somers crew. They intended to use the fast well-armed brig for piracy in the Caribbean. Seaman Elisha Small was involved in the conversation, and Wales was threatened with death if he revealed Spencer's plan. Captain Alexander Slidell Mackenzie Discovery On 26 November, Wales notified Captain Mackenzie of the plan through his chain of command via purser H.M. Heiskill and first lieutenant Guert Gansevoort. Captain Mackenzie was not inclined to take the matter seriously, but instructed Lt. Gansevoort to watch Spencer and the crew for evidence of confirmation. Lt. Gansevoort learned from other members of the crew that Spencer had been observed in secret nightly conferences with seaman Small and Boatswain's Mate Samuel Cromwell. Captain Mackenzie confronted Spencer with Wales' allegation that evening. Spencer replied that he told Wales the story as a joke. Spencer was arrested and put in irons on the quarterdeck. Papers written in English using Greek letters were discovered in a search of Spencer's locker and translated by Midshipman Henry Rodgers. Spencer's secret note :\\"CERTAIN: P. Spencer, E. Andrews, D.

He was fascinated by pirates and buccaneers and may have used the pirates model for a sailors' \\"fraternity\\". He was insufficiently trained and foolishly unaware of the captain's authority. A mast failed and damaged some sail rigging on 27 November. The timing and circumstances were regarded as suspicious; and Cromwell, the largest man on the crew, was questioned about his alleged meetings with Spencer. Cromwell said: \\"It was not me, sir ‚Äì it was Small.\\" Small was questioned and admitted meeting with Spencer. Both Cromwell and Small joined Spencer in irons on the quarterdeck. On 28 November wardroom steward Henry Waltham was flogged for having stolen brandy for Spencer; and, after the flogging, Captain Mackenzie informed the crew of a plot by Spencer to have them murdered. Waltham was flogged again on 29 November for suggesting theft of three bottles of wine to one of the apprentices. Sailmaker's mate Charles A. Wilson was detected attempting to obtain a weapon on that afternoon, and Landsman McKinley and Apprentice Green missed muster when their watch was called at midnight.Baldwin, 1955. The officers respond Four more men were put in irons on the morning of 30 November: Wilson, McKinley, Green, and Cromwell's friend, Alexander McKie. Captain Mackenzie then addressed a letter to his four wardroom officers (First Lieutenant Gansevoort,Lt. Gansevoort was a cousin of Herman Melville whose famous novella Billy Budd was not closely based on the Somers mutiny. Passed Assistant Surgeon L.W. Leecock, Purser Heiskill, and Acting Master M.C. Perry) and three oldest midshipmen (Henry Rodgers, Egbert Thompson, and Charles W. Hayes), asking their opinion as to the best course of action. The seven convened in the wardroom to interview members of the crew. Samuel Eliot Morison, \\"Old Bruin\\": Commodore Matthew C. Perry, 1794-1858 (1967) pp 144-62. On 1 December, the officers reported that they had \\"come to a cool, decided, and unanimous opinion\\" that Spencer, Cromwell, and Small were \\"guilty of a full and determined intention to commit a mutiny;\\" and they recommended that the three be put to death, despite Spencer's claim that the accused conspirators \\"had been pretending piracy\\". The plotters were hanged that day and buried at sea. Some have noted that the captain could have waited since there were only thirteen days to home port. In response, the captain noted the fatigue of his officers, the smallness of the vessel and the inadequacies of the confinement. Aftermath Somers reached St. Thomas on 5 December and returned to New York on 14 December. She remained there during a naval court of inquiry which investigated the alleged mutiny and subsequent executions. The court exonerated Mackenzie, as did a subsequent court-martial, held at his request to avoid a trial in civil court. Nevertheless, the general populace remained skeptical. Morison, 1967.

He is an associate professor at the Department of Biochemistry at the National University of Singapore and founding director of the National Supercomputing Center (NSCC) Singapore since 1999. As the inventor and founder of multilingual internationalized domain names (IDN) and a pioneer of the Internet, he was inducted into the Internet Society of 2012 along with the founding fathers of the Internet in the first Internet Hall of Fame. He is well known in Singapore and the region for his work on propagating and developing the Internet.http://newshub.nus.edu.sg/news/1012/PDF/WEB- st-19dec-p32.pdf  Life and Work  Tan studied Biochemistry at the University of Cambridge from 1982 to 1985, after which he received the Master of Science in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology on University College London and did followed it up with a PhD in molecular biology on vaccines at University of Edinburgh in 1990. He returned to Singapore in 1990 to develop TechNet, Singapore's first network for a nationwide research community. In 1994, he and his Chinese language team wrote a program that matches the code for each character and then merged the images into one larger image, and extended this concept to the Tamil language. Tan was responsible for several key internet milestones, including the first Gopher Server, the Singapore InfoWeb and the forerunner of the Present National Web Homepage. Under his leadership, the Internet Research and Development Unit (IRDU), developed the first regional Java website and the first functional multilingual domain name system (iDNS). In addition to his NUS position, Tan is also chair of the agency for the Computational Resource Center for Science, Technology and Research, which is equipping Singapore with supercomputing capabilities for the twenty-first century. With this in mind, he is now pioneering the use of new technologies for online computer communication. TCP / IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol), the communication protocol that the Internet largely uses today, can be improved upon for certain purposes. Some of its addressing computations is redundant for grid computing purposes. A newer communication technology called InfiniBand transmits data with much shorter delay times, less (possible) information loss and higher efficiency than TCP / IP. However, it is currently only used for short-range communication between supercomputers. In November 2014, his team, along with Australian, Japanese and US universities, as well as industry partners Obsidian Strategics and Tata Communications, demonstrated the first high-speed InfiniBand. connection between three continents on a platform called InfiniCortex. In conventional grid computing, distributed processors perform tasks that are parallel but more or less independent. Instead, InfiniCortex offers simultaneous supercomputing, in which intermediate results can be quickly transferred between processors that are located across the globe. In this way, the participating centers can perform challenging tasks such as, intensive computer-aided fluid dynamics or analysis of genomic data - by efficiently sharing computing resources.  Awards  For his work, he received national and international recognition: the Singapore Youth Award for Excellence (1994), the Vaccine Research Trust Annual Award (1989), the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (JCCI) Education Award (1997 ), the ASEAN Achievement Award (1997) from the ASEAN Business Forum, the Life Insurance Association (LIA) Award for community work, the 7th Innovation Award of the Indian Cultural Festival (1998), the Achievement Award (1998), the gold medal of the World Congress for Medical Informatics MEDINFO'92 and he is a member of the International Who's Who of Professionals (1999) and a member of the exclusive World Technology Network (2001) as one of 450 leading scientists and entrepreneurs worldwide. He has been featured in the SINGAPORE TAMILS 200 a book which was released in honour of those who contributed to the Indian community development.

In the five years following 2014, investment in FreightTech companies grew from $118 million to $3 billion per year.  Disruption of traditional logistics and supply chain management  The shipping and logistics industry has long been viewed as conservative and slow- to-change, in part due to complex relationships within global shipping and transportation networks, difficult documentation and customs requirements, lack of transparency among involved parties, and obstacles to adapting quickly to sudden economic changes. Recent developments in freight technology are working to modernize and simplify freight transport. According to a report from the U.S. Department of Transportation, intelligent freight technologies have multifaceted benefits in shipping and logistics. These include increased operational flexibility and efficiency due to better planning and schedule adherence, better utilization of people and equipment, reduction of non- productive waiting times, shorter processing times, and increased shipper confidence. Transactional application programming interfaces (API) and distributed ledger technology are expanding in the shipping and logistics sector to reduce extensive paperwork, monitor conditions and location of freight and goods in transport and make this information available to involved parties, and increase transparency across the supply chain.  Truck freight  The first steps to digitization in trucking came in the form of digital freight exchanges such as Teleroute and TIMOCOM. Greater efficiency in trucking is being achieved through intelligent freight technology such as automated interfaces that can help truckers and regulatory bodies reduce stops at weigh stations and time spent at border checkpoints. This improves schedule adherence, reduces administrative burdens, and increases fuel efficiency by minimizing time spent idling. Mobile tracking programs can also reduce theft and loss of cargo by recording instances where trailer doors are opened outside of approved areas (geo-fences) and alerting authorities. Growing automation of quoting and booking of truckload shipments and increased automation of matching trucks with appropriate loads in a timely manner is also working to maximize efficiency for shippers and consumers. Due to the relatively short life cycle of three to four years for commercial trucks, implementation of new interfaces and freight technologies has progressed more quickly in trucking than in other sectors. Compared with other modes of transport such as aviation and rail, however, driverless technologies for road transport have lagged behind due to road environments being more complex than separated spaces for rail and air transport.  Air freight  Freight technology in air cargo is already critically important in cold chain management for sensitive goods such as agricultural products, vaccines, and medications. Monitoring in the form of data loggers can record temperature, light, humidity, and GPS location to show whether goods have been improperly cooled, handled, or tampered with. It is estimated that billions of dollars in revenue are lost by cargo companies annually due to dispute resolution for shipment delays and lost and damaged goods. The world‚Äôs first blockchain-based system for streamlining air cargo costing, billing, and reconciliation was announced at the 2019 IATA World Cargo Symposium.  Rail freight  The Freight Technology Group, responsible for identifying relevant technologies for the freight sector in the UK, has identified three key technical innovations already in use in rail freight. These include timetable advisory systems which allow drivers to track train progress against timetables via software hosted on tablets, freight collaborative decision-making systems which offer real-time information on arrivals of freight services, and mobile consisting applications which reduce the amount of information sent manually to relevant parties and authorities by collecting information and transmitting it directly. However, advancements in rail freight technology have progressed more slowly than in other sectors due to the decades-long life cycles of locomotives and railcars and the lack of power supply in freight cars. A $10 billion upgrade to the North American rail system was mandated by Congress to include automated safety overrides after a 2008 commuter train accident, laying the groundwork for autonomous rails in the United States. In 2019, mining group Rio Tinto launched the world‚Äôs first autonomous heavy-haul freight railway trains in Western Australia to deliver ore from mines to ports.  Sea freight  The growing number of smart ports around the world are increasing capacity and efficiency for shippers, ports, and freight forwarding partners, such as trucking carriers. Reductions in labour and machinery costs can be seen at ports thanks to improvements in automated and semi-automated cranes, which reduce the need for yard transfer vehicles. In 2018, shipping conglomerate Maersk partnered with IBM to create TradeLens, a platform for sharing and streamlining shipping information across shipping partners, businesses, and different authorities. By 2019, the platform covered nearly half of the world‚Äôs shipments of cargo containers.  Intermodal freight  Freight that is shipped using multiple modes of transport is called intermodal freight. Freight technology plays a pivotal role in intermodal freight transport by streamlining communication, documentation, and dispute resolution across various industry players as cargo changes hands. Freight technology offers a way to increase transparency across industry players at each step of the supply chain. Smart contracts, for example, can use information collected by data loggers, such as temperature data on cold chain shipments, to resolve or dispute a contract depending on whether the agreed upon terms of shipping have been followed.

British Columbia Federation of Labour had met already three days prior to the event and had prepared several resolutions to propose. British Columbia Federation of Labour was viewed as having the most radical beliefs of any of the attending groups of delegates. The resolutions proposed by the British Columbia Federation of Labour were for a working schedule with a six hour work day, the end of allied interference in Russia, the severing off connections with international unions outside of Canada, the end of the political imprisonment of Canadian citizens, and the acknowledgement of the current impediment of labor movements under the capitalist economic system. If these demands were not met by the Canadian government by June 1, 1919, the newly formed One Big Union (Canada) would call for a general strike.Logan, H. A. \\"Rise and Decline of the One Big Union in Canada.\\" Journal of Political Economy 36, no. 2 (1928): 250. The resolutions were concluded with a greeting of solidarity towards the Russian Bolsheviks and the German Spartacus League. These resolution were met with opposition among the other delegates of the conference. More moderate delegates of the conference proposed the idea of polling all registered Canadian trade unionists on the decision of the creation of the One Big Union (Canada) as well as the formal leaving of Trades and Labour Congress of Canada and American Federation of Labor.

The project was launched in December 2017 and is funded by the \\"mFund\\" of the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure already in the second funding stage, thanks to the successful completion of the FeGiS feasibility study in 2018.  Project approach  The idea of FeGiS is to compare danger points in road traffic reported by road users from all over Germany via crowdsourcing (on the platform gefahrenstellen.de) with other data sources such as official accident data and kinematic data (vehicle motion data from cars and smartphones). The combination and analysis of these data sets are intended to identify hazard points at an early stage and to weight them using a \\"hazard score\\". On the one hand, this information about danger spots is to be incorporated into intelligent applications for road users. Such applications can emit warning messages in good time and indicate safer routes for roads, cycle paths and footpaths. On the other hand, these continuously updated data sets are to be compiled on a web platform and made available to participants in road safety work such as local authorities, police, science, engineering firms for traffic planning, navigation providers and car manufacturers for road safety and prevention work throughout Germany. In order for data to be updated regularly, uniform data formats and automated interfaces for the various data sources as well as guidelines for data protection are to be defined. FeGiS thus wants to create a new database for up-to-date information about danger spots. Hence, the research project can make an important contribution to more safety on the roads in Germany.  Background  While it was possible to achieve a continuous reduction in the number of road fatalities in Germany by 2010, the number of all accidents and injuries has risen again over the last decade. Causes for this development can be found, for example, in increased traffic volume, stress in everyday life, or distractions while driving. Therefore, dangerous situations are often not correctly assessed or they are recognised too late. Early recognition of danger points can prevent accidents by warning road users in good time or by eliminating the danger through appropriate measures.  Successes to date  The feasibility study of the project was also sponsored by the \\"mFund\\" of the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure. During this first funding stage, the crowdsourcing platform \\"gefahrenstellen.de\\" developed by the ‚ÄúInitiative for Safer Roads‚Äù in cooperation with the Institute for Road Engineering at RWTH Aachen University (ISAC), was successfully tested between 2017 and 2018. The focus was on the cities of Bonn and Aachen. Thanks to the extensive reporting in newspapers, online portals, and on radio and TV, a total of 1,500 danger reports with around 3,500 supporters were generated for the two cities over a period of approximately 6 months. A subsequent research analysis by RWTH Aachen University confirmed the high validity of the hazard reports. In addition to the identification of already known accident black spots, road users also reported danger spots that had not yet become conspicuous due to accidents, but showed a high risk potential during site inspections. This form of crowdsourcing was thus confirmed as a method for the early detection of danger points, so that it was decided to continue the project with an extended project approach.  The project consortium  Since the launch of the FeGiS feasibility study in 2017 the consortium coordinator ‚ÄúInitiative for Safer Roads‚Äù collaborates with the Institute of Highway Engineering at the RWTH Aachen University (ISAC). For the further development of the project to the advanced version FeGiS+, the project consortium has been extended to also include the following additional partners: German Police University - Department of Traffic Science & Traffic Psychology, PTV Planung Transport Verkehr AG and DTV-Verkehrsconsult GmbH.  Development of FeGiS+  During the second funding stage between 2019-2022 the FeGiS concept is further developed towards the model presented above (see project approach). The focus during this development phase lies on analysing the correlation between the different data streams and on aggregating the information in order to extract ‚Äúsmart data‚Äù as a result. Such data will be tailored and adapted to the needs of the different user groups. The extensive experience and knowledge of the partners of FeGiS+ will be instrumental in the further development of the project. Furthermore, the intention of FeGiS+ is to generate a new database for up-to-date information about danger spots and thus, the FeGiS+ approach could also serve as blueprint for other countries. In this line, the development plan of the research project also includes a test of the applicability of the FeGiS+ approach in neighbouring European countries. Also the European Commission pursues the ‚Äúvision zero‚Äù (zero road fatalities) and hence, outlines the proactive identification of danger points in road traffic as one of its priorities in the EU Road Safety Policy Framework 2021-2030.

At that time, the Market Square attracted merchants from various, often very distant, European countries. The largest fair took place around 24 June, on St. John's Day, and the subject of trade was then mainly grain and wool. After the collapse of the trade in these articles, the fairs fell into decline, especially at the beginning of the 18th century. It was reopened in 1780 by the Good Order Commission. The 19th century caused that the fairs also gained a social function and became the time of meetings of the Wielkopolska landowners (they were called St John's Day contracts). Numerous balls were held at that time, theatres and dancers arrived. The tradition was revived in 1975 on the initiative of President Andrzej Wituski (inspired by the appearance of Grand-Place in Brussels) and temporarily connected with the organization of the Pozna≈Ñ International Fair. At that time, state trade prevailed and one could buy scarce goods, which were absent from the shelves of shops on ordinary days. Nowadays, the fair is an arena for trade in handicrafts, regional food and antiques. It is accompanied by numerous festivals and cultural performances, mainly musical. It is one of the magnets that attracts tourists.

The crash site was located on 12 December 2019 after a three-day search, and no survivors were found. Aircraft The aircraft was built in 1978 for the United States Air Force with tail number 77-0324 and serial number 382-4776, but was delivered to the United States Marine Corps as a KC-130R tanker for aerial refueling operations and assigned BuNo 160628. It operated in Cherry Point, North Carolina (VMGR-252) and in Iwakuni, Japan (VMGR-152). The aircraft was placed in storage at AMARG from 2009 until 2014. After being purchased by the Chilean Air Force for US$7 million, it was refurbished at Hill AFB, Utah, to C-130H standards and delivered in 2015 under the new tail number 990. Accident The aircraft departed Punta Arenas, Patagonia, Chile, at 19:55 UTC (16:55 local time) bound for King George Island, Antarctica. The flight was intended to provide supplies to a base in Chilean Antarctic Territory and to bring personnel to inspect a floating fuel supply line and other equipment at the base. The Chilean Air Force flies from Punta Arenas to King George Island monthly. Radio contact with the plane was lost at 21:13 UTC. Search Argentina sea search A search was conducted by aircraft from the Chilean Air Force, Argentina, Brazil, United Kingdom, United States and Uruguay. Also, two Chilean Navy frigates searched the area where the aircraft was last observed by radar. They were aided by a team of satellite imagery analysts from the Israeli Defense Forces' Unit 9900. The search effort was hampered by rough seas and poor visibility. Crash site One day into the search, debris from an aircraft was found floating in the sea from the last known position of the missing aircraft. Debris and personal items were recovered by Brazilian Navy polar research ship Almirante Maximiano. The crash site was located off the coast of South America on 12 December, from the C-130's last known position. The aircraft fuselage and main components were identified along with human remains. Chilean Air Force chief Arturo Merino confirmed that everyone on board was killed.  Passengers and crew  The aircraft had 38 people on board, 21 passengers and 17 crew. Fifteen passengers were Chilean Air Force servicemen, three were Chilean soldiers, two were civilians employed by the Inproser engineering and construction firm, and one was a student at University of Magallanes. The crew was composed entirely of Chilean air force personnel.  Investigation  An accident investigation is being conducted by the Chilean Air Force. , the cause of the crash is unknown, due in part to an insufficient quantity of recovered components. The aircraft experienced a complete break-up, either in- flight, or after crashing into the sea.

General history History by government ministry History of conflict (Early to mid-2010s) Syrian Civil War The Syrian Civil War is an ongoing multi-sided civil war in Syria fought between the Ba'athist Syrian Arab Republic led by Syrian President Bashar al- Assad, along with domestic and foreign allies, and various domestic and foreign forces opposing both the Syrian government and each other in varying combinations. The war is currently the second deadliest of the 21st century. The unrest in Syria, part of a wider wave of the 2011 Arab Spring protests, grew out of discontent with the Syrian government and escalated to an armed conflict after protests calling for Assad's removal were violently suppressed. The war, which began on 15 March 2011 with major unrest in Damascus and Aleppo, is being fought by several factions: the Syrian Armed Forces and its international allies, a loose alliance of mostly Sunni opposition rebel groups (including the Free Syrian Army), Salafi jihadist groups (including al-Nusra Front), the mixed Kurdish-Arab Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), with a number of countries in the region and beyond being either directly involved or providing support to one or another faction (Iran, Russia, Turkey, the United States, as well as others). Iran, Russia, and Hezbollah support the Syrian Arab Republic and the Syrian Armed Forces militarily, with Russia conducting airstrikes and other military operations since September 2015. The U.S.-led international coalition, established in 2014 with the declared purpose of countering ISIL, has conducted airstrikes primarily against ISIL as well as some against government and pro-government targets. They have also deployed special forces and artillery units to engage ISIL on the ground. Since 2015, the U.S. has supported the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria and its armed wing, the SDF, materially, financially, and logistically. Turkey has been directly involved in operations against the Syrian government since August 2016, not only participating in airstrikes against ISIL alongside the U.S.-led coalition, but also actively supporting the Syrian opposition and occupying large swaths of northwestern Syria while engaging in significant ground combat with ISIL, the SDF, and the Syrian government. Between 2011 and 2017, fighting from the Syrian Civil War spilled over into Lebanon as opponents and supporters of the Syrian government traveled to Lebanon to fight and attack each other on Lebanese soil, with ISIL and Al-Nusra also engaging the Lebanese Army. Furthermore, while officially neutral, Israel has conducted airstrikes against Hezbollah and Iranian forces, whose presence in southwestern Syria it views as a threat. International organizations have criticized virtually all sides involved, including the Ba'athist Syrian government, ISIL, opposition rebel groups, Russia, and the U.S.-led coalition of severe human rights violations and massacres. The conflict has caused a major refugee crisis. Over the course of the war, a number of peace initiatives have been launched, including the March 2017 Geneva peace talks on Syria led by the United Nations, but fighting continues. History of conflict (Late 2010s to present) Turkish offensive, 2019 The 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria, code-named by Turkey as Operation Peace Spring (), is a cross-border military operation conducted by the Turkish Armed Forces (TAF) and the Syrian National Army (SNA) against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and later the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) in northeastern Syria. On 6 October 2019, the Trump administration ordered American troops to withdraw from northeastern Syria, where the United States had been supporting its Kurdish allies. The military operation began on 9 October 2019 when the Turkish Air Force launched airstrikes on border towns. The conflict resulted in the displacement of over 300,000 people and has caused the death of more than 70 civilians in Syria and 20 civilians in Turkey. Human rights violations have also been reported. Amnesty International stated that it had gathered evidence of war crimes and other violations committed by Turkish and Turkey-backed Syrian forces who are said to \\"have displayed a shameful disregard for civilian life, carrying out serious violations and war crimes, including summary killings and unlawful attacks that have killed and injured civilians\\". According to the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, the operation is intended to expel the SDF‚Äîviewed as a terrorist organization by Turkey due to its ties with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), but considered an ally against ISIL by the United States and its allies‚Äîfrom the border region as well as to create a 30 km-deep (20 mi) \\"safe zone\\" in Northern Syria where some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees in Turkey would resettle. As the proposed settlement zone is heavily Kurdish demographically, this intention has been criticized as an attempt to force drastic demographic change, a criticism denied by Turkey by saying that it only intended to \\"correct\\" the demographics that Turkish officials stated were changed by the SDF. The Turkish operation received mixed responses by the international community. Including condemnations as well as support for the operation for the settlement of refugees in Northern Syria. While originally acknowledging Turkey's \\"right to defend itself\\", on 15 October, Russia hardened its position against the operation and deployed troops. Ten European nations and Canada imposed an arms embargo on Turkey, while the U.S. imposed sanctions on Turkish ministries and senior government officials in response to the offensive in Syria. Likewise, Trump's sudden pullout of US forces in Syria was also criticized by journalists as a \\"serious betrayal to the Kurds\\" as well as a \\"catastrophic blow to US credibility as an ally and Washington's standing on the world stage\\", one journalist stating that \\"this is one of the worst US foreign policy disasters since the Iraq War\\". On November 19, the Defense Department inspector general released a report finding that the American withdrawal and subsequent Turkish incursion allowed ISIL to \\"reconstitute capabilities and resources within Syria and strengthen its ability to plan attacks abroad\\". The Syrian government initially criticized the Kurdish forces for the Turkish offensive, for their separatism and not reconciling with the government, while at the same time also condemning the foreign invasion in Syrian territory. However, a few days later, the SDF reached an agreement with the Syrian government, in which it would allow the Syrian Army to enter the SDF-held towns of Manbij and Koban√Æ in an attempt to defend the towns from the Turkish offensive. Shortly thereafter, Syrian state broadcaster SANA announced that Syrian Army troops had started to deploy to the country's north. Turkey and the SNA launched an offensive to capture Manbij on the same day. On 17 October 2019, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence announced that the U.S. and Turkey agreed on a deal in which Turkey will agree to a ceasefire in Syria for 5 days in return for a complete withdrawal by the SDF from a safe zone south of the Syria-Turkey border. On 22 October 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan reached a deal to extend the ceasefire by 150 additional hours for SDF to move 30 kilometers away from the border area as well as from Tal Rifaat and Manbij. The terms of the deal also included joint Russian‚ÄìTurkish patrols 10 kilometers into Syria from the border except in the city of Qamishli. The new ceasefire started at 12pm local time on 23 October. Changes to conflict due to Turkish incursion of October 2019  Changes in the local areas  In October 2019, in response to the Turkish offensive, Russia arranged for negotiations between the Syrian government in Damascus and the Kurdish-led forces. Mazloum Abdi, the Syrian Kurdish commander-in-chief, announced that they are ready to partner with Vladimir Putin (Russia) and Bashar al-Assad (Syria), stating that \\"We know that we would have to make painful compromises with Moscow and Bashar al-Assad if we go down the road of working with them. But if we have to choose between compromises and the genocide of our people, we will surely choose life for our people.\\" The details of the agreement is unknown, but there are reports that suggest that the SDF will be incorporated into the Syrian Armed Forces and that northeastern Syria will come under direct rule of the Syrian government in Damascus. According to Syrian Kurdish officials, the deal allows Syrian government forces to take over security in some border areas, but their own administration would maintain control of local institutions. The prospects for Kurdish autonomy in the region is severely diminished, because the Kurds were exposed to the Turkish-led offensive by the US withdrawal and the Russia- backed Syrian government forces under Assad‚Äîwhose commonality is enmity towards Turkey and Sunni rebel militias‚Äîregained their foothold in northeast Syria after the Kurds had to seek their help. In regards to the United States and the situation, Mazloum Abdi stated that \\"We are disappointed and frustrated by the current crisis. Our people are under attack, and their safety is our paramount concern. Two questions remain: How can we best protect our people? And is the United States still our ally?\\" A deep sense of betrayal by their once American allies has come to be felt among the Syrian Kurdish populace. As announced by Russia's Ministry of Defense on 15 October, Russian forces have started to patrol the region along the line of contact between Turkish and Syrian forces, indicating that Russia is filling the security vacuum from the sudden US withdrawal. Video footage shows Russian soldiers and journalists touring a base that the US left behind. Alexander Lavrentiev, Russia's special envoy on Syria, warned that the Turkish offensive into Syria is unacceptable and stated that Russia is seeking to prevent conflict between Turkish and Syrian troops. In response to a speech by Assad, the Syrian Democratic Council said it was ready to have positive discussions with the Assad government. They said their focus would shift to stopping the Turkish invasion. Syrian Democratic Council : We are ready to start negotiating with Damascus, 02-11-2019, Lawk Ghafuri, rudaw.net. International reactions to Turkish incursion of October 2019 Several US lawmakers have criticized the abandonment of their Kurdish allies, remarking that it undermines US credibility as an ally while benefiting Russia, Iran, and the Syrian regime of Assad. Meanwhile, several commentators in Moscow have stated that the situation is not in the immediate Russian interests, as the Turkish intervention in Syria clashes with Russia's backing of the Syrian government in the region, but it may provide opportunities for Russia as mediator as the US withdraws from Syria. Commentators have remarked that, since the US withdrawal, Russia has cemented its status as the key power broker in the Middle East. Due to the situation in Syria, there are signs of a schism between Turkey and other NATO members, in which NATO is seen as effectively \\"powerless\\" to manage the situation and the Turkish government is aware that NATO does not hold much leverage. Furthermore, US President Trump, as well as US military and diplomatic officials, has cited the NATO membership of Turkey as a key reason that the United States can not be involved in the conflict between the Turkish and Syrian Kurdish forces. Meanwhile, due to Turkey's strategic position between Europe and the Middle East, the NATO alliance members are in a situation where they have limited themselves to relatively muted criticism. The U.S. is reviewing the potential withdrawal of its nuclear weapons from Incirlik airbase under NATO's nuclear sharing as a result of the Turkish offensive per NYT. Republican senator Lindsay Graham and Democratic representative Eric Swalwell have called for possibly suspending Turkey's membership in NATO. Agreement to Northern Buffer Zone Russia and Turkey made an agreement via the Sochi Agreement of 2019 to set up a Second Northern Syria Buffer Zone. Syrian President Assad expressed full support for the deal, as various terms of the agreement also applied to the Syrian government. Turkey and Russia agree on deal over buffer zone in northern Syria. Erdoƒüan hails agreement with Putin in which Kurdish fighters will be moved from border area. guardian.com. The agreement reportedly included the following terms:The Sochi Agreement And Its Implications OCTOBER 25, 2019. * A buffer zone would be established in Northern Syria. The zone would be around ' deep, stretching from Euphrates River to Tall Abyad and from Ras al-Ayn to the Iraq-Syria border, but excluding the town of Qamishli, the Kurds' de facto capital. * The buffer zone would be controlled jointly by the Syrian Army and Russian Military Police. * All YPG forces, which constitute the majority of the SDF, must withdraw from the buffer zone entirely, along with their weapons, within 150 hours from the announcement of the deal. Their withdrawal would be overseen by Russian Military Police and the Syrian Border Guards, which would enter the zone at noon on 23 October. * The YPG would also withdraw from the cities of Manbij and Tell Rifaat. * Following the YPG withdrawal, joint Russian-Turkish ground patrols would be held in the buffer zone area, but only within ' from the border and not including Qamishli. * Turkey would retain sole control of the areas it had captured during its offensive between the towns of Tell Abyad and Ras al-Ayn. * The Syrian Government would construct and man 15 border posts on the Turkish-Syrian border. * The parties would launch a joint effort to resettle Syrian refugees in a \\"safe and voluntary manner\\". * The parties would agree to \\"preserve the political unity and territorial integrity of Syria\\" as well as protect the \\"national security of Turkey\\". * The parties would agree to reaffirm the importance of the Adana Agreement.

It was released in 2010. Background Susan Graham According to Heggie, Passing By is about life's transience, the chances that either bring people together or keep them apart and the dismay of losing a person whom one had never expected to be without. At the Statue of Venus, dedicated to Karen Kriendler Nelson, was commissioned by Opera Colorado for the grand opening of the Ellie Caulkins Opera House in Denver, Colorado on 10 September 2005. Originally intended for Ren√©e Fleming, it was premiered by Kristin Clayton. This scena is about a woman on a blind date waiting to meet a man in a museum. Beginning in a nervous hope that she may be about to discover her soul mate, she gradually becomes angrier and angrier as it dawns on her that he might have seen her from a distance and decided to stand her up. \\"A lucky child\\" is the aria that she sings when she is on the verge of leaving in a huff.https://www.jakeheggie.com/works/https://www.sfcv.org/reviews/passing- by-jake-heggie-enters-the-heart Some Times of Day was commissioned through Stanford University for the mezzo-soprano Zheng Cao and the Harmida Piano Trio, comprising violinist Dawn Harms, cellist Emil Miland and pianist Laura Dahl. It was premiered by them in the Temple Emanu-El in San Francisco on 31 January 2005. The aim of the cycle is to present the experience of a single day as a metaphor for an entire life. \\"Minuet\\" is about morning, \\"when we wake to see an idealized version of ourselves, young, dancing, magical\\". \\"Simple\\" is about noon, and about how the bliss of being enveloped by beauty in the summer of one's days can be clouded by presentiments of death. \\"The best time of the day\\" is about evening, and about how the aged look back on their lives' harvest of \\"love, peace, beauty and bounty\\". Isabel Bayrakdarian (courtesy of the Armenian Embassy) Facing Forward/Looking Back was commissioned by Welz Kaufman and the Ravinia Festival in honour of the Steans Institute for Young Artists. It was premiered by soprano Mich√®le Bogdanowicz, mezzo-soprano Tamara Mumford and pianist Vlad Iftinca in the John B. Harza Building's Bennett Gordon Hall on 8 August 2007. The album presents four of the cycle's five songs, omitting \\"Hummingbird - for Tess\\", a setting of a poem by Raymond Carver. The first three are settings of autobiographical poems written by friends of Heggie's specially for his use. \\"Motherwit\\" is about a daughter wishing that she could summon her dead mother back to life and build a better relationship with her than she had been able to do in her youth. \\"Grounded\\" is about what can happen when a daughter is obliged to assume the responsibility of caring for a mother suffering dementia. \\"Mother in the mirror\\" is about seeing the face of one's dead mother in one's own reflection. \\"Facing forward\\", with a text by Heggie himself, was written by the composer when he was nineteen and studyng in Paris. It is about how, having lost his father to suicide at the age of ten, Heggie coped with his personal problems by imagining the conversations with his father that he was unable to have in reality. Joyce DiDonato at the Wigmore Hall Here and Gone was also commissioned by Welz Kaufman and the Ravinia Festival for the Steans Institute. It was premiered at the Institute by tenor Nicholas Phan and baritone Andrew Garland on 6 August 2005. When Heggie was studying music at the University of California at Los Angeles, Johana Harris (1912-1995), the elderly Canadian pianist who taught, mentored and married him, introduced him to the poetry of A. E. Housman and Vachel Lindsay. In later life Heggie conceived the idea of shaping a selection of their verse into a narrative that would reflect both their personal histories and his own. The cycle's baritone, a traveller, goes back to the place where he grew up in the hope of reconciling with his friend (a tenor) who had declared a homosexual love for him that he had spurned. On returning to his home, he discovers that his friend has died, that the backdrop of his youth has been transformed and that he has become a stranger there. Part of the cycle was adapted from songs that Heggie wrote at UCLA in 1987, and some from work that he did at Edenfred, an artistic residency and community centre, now closed, that the Terry family instituted in 2004 in Madison, Wisconsin.https://www.wisconsinacademy.org/magazine/farewell-edenfred Jake Heggie To Say Before Going to Sleep was composed by Heggie in his student days. He described it as \\"a response to the longing and fragility expressed in one stanza from Rilke's beloved poem\\". Songs and Sonnets to Ophelia was mostly composed for soprano Peggy Kriha-Dye, and was premiered by her in the James Schwabacher recital series in the Old First Church, San Francisco on 9 May 2009. The first song in the cycle came to Heggie in a flash of inspiration in 1993 when Johana Harris chanced to say \\"The hills are green, my dear one\\". Sixteen years later, it occurred to him that the song might be a good prelude to a larger work about Ophelia, \\"an extraordinary young woman - pushed, pulled and used in a world dominated by men - seeking connection and agonizing over love\\". He felt that a real-life, twentieth-century Ophelia might well have felt a kinship with Edna St. Vincent Millay, and that the three unrelated Millay poems that he selected for his cycle were apt for telling Ophelia's story. Final Monologue from Master Class was commissioned for mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato by Rusty Rolland in memory of James Schwabacher and to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the Merola Opera Program. It was premiered by DiDonato at the gala that Merola mounted in honour of Schwabacher on 10 September 2005. Master Class is a play about the Greek American operatic soprano Maria Callas: the monologue is a scena in which Callas ponders music and her career after a student has accused her of being rash, callous and selfish. Recording The album was recorded on 21-24 June 2007 and 12-13 January 2008 at Skywalker Sound, Nicasio, California.Heggie, Jake: Passing By - Songs by Jake Heggie, with Isabel Bayrakdarian, Zheng Cao, Joyce DiDonato, Susan Graham, Paul Groves, Keith Phares, Frederica von Stade, Dawn Harms (violin), CarlaMaria Rodrigues (viola), Emil Miland (cello) and Jake Heggie (piano), Avie Records CD, AV-2198, 2010 Cover art The cover of the album was designed by its art director, Alan Trugman, and features a photograph by Jay Elliott of jayelliottphoto.com. Critical reception A. E. Housman, photographed by E. A. Hopp√© in 1910 Edward Seckerson reviewed the album in the 2010 Awards Issue of Gramophone. Opera, he wrote, needed composers like Jake Heggie. His theatre pieces Dead Man Walking and Moby-Dick were both popular in the United States, and this was not something that anyone should wonder at. He had an innate grasp of the music latent in language, and he knew how to carry forward \\"the emotional memory of a moment, a connection, a feeling\\" through \\"that still much maligned enchantress\\", melody. Heggie and composers like him reminded us that just as songs were about drama, music-drama was about songs.Seckerson, Edward: Gramophone, Awards Issue 2010, p. 107 The songs in Passing By sang with a passion. Like a Broadway tunesmith, Heggie knew how to \\"hook\\" listeners \\"in an isolated phrase or a long line\\", but he also had an intuitive understanding of how to craft a song's total architecture. In the duets of Facing Forward/Looking Back, for example, Heggie explored the relationships of mothers and their children \\"through the harmonic tensions and equivocations of two-part counterpoint where consonance is always a whisker away from dissonance or in one instance - the Armistead Maupin setting 'Mother in the mirror' - downright abrasiveness\\". The extraordinary interplay of the vocal lines in \\"Facing forward\\" - superbly interpreted by Joyce DiDonato and Frederica von Stade - was painful in its emotional truth-telling, something that it was easier to understand when one learned that the text of the piece, written by the composer himself, reflected the ten-year-old Heggie's loss of his father to suicide. Eloquently performed by Paul Groves and Keith Phares, Here and Gone drew on poems by Vachel Lindsay and A. E. Housman on the theme of \\"love unrequited only to be acknowledged when it is too late\\". There was not a syllable in these verses for which Heggie did not find the right note. The Brittenesque \\"Factory window song\\" was amazingly acid, and the resignation of \\"The half-moon westers low\\" was enough to break one's heart. Raymond Carver Rilke's \\"To sing before going to sleep\\" received a \\"glorious and solitary\\" setting that Joyce DiDonato sang exquisitely. DiDonato was effective, too, in the album's closing item, a setting of the monologue at the end of Master Class, Terrence McNally's drama about the opera diva Maria Callas. An opera singer herself, DiDonato knew how to convey Heggie's profound insight into \\"the poignant subtext of this 'confessional'. The isolation and unforgiving 'hollowness' of the line 'Besides, it's all there in the recordings' says more about Callas's losses - her one true love and career - than the entire play.\\" Jason Victor Serinus reviewed the album for San Francisco Classical Voice on 16 November 2010. Until recently, he wrote, some people had regarded Heggie as likeable but superficial and mediocre. His opera Dead Man Walking had improved his reputation, and his follow-up, Moby-Dick, had proved that he was no one- hit wonder. In his new CD of exquisitely crafted art songs, he had produced an album which would probably be enjoyed by devotees of Franz Schubert and Robert Schumann, such was the \\"beauty and care\\" with which it addressed \\"love and loss\\". Terrence McNally His standing in America's musical life was evidenced by the extraordinary roster of singers listed on his album's cover. His instrumentalists might not be quite as famous, but their playing was just as accomplished as the vocalism of their starrier colleagues. \\"A lovely child\\", the first track on the disc, was typical of the mood of the collection as a whole. The work from which it was excerpted was a hilarious comedy, but the aria was something different from what surrounded it: an \\"introspective gem\\" that essayed a simple meditation on how we experience love in infancy. Susan Graham's performance of it was \\"so natural and relaxed [and] so deeply felt\\" that it went \\"straight to the heart\\". In Some Times of Day, Zheng Cao, Dawn Harms, Emil Miland and Heggie himself were all \\"at their virtuosic best\\". Especially noteworthy were Harms's \\"teasing\\" violin in \\"The minuet\\" and a \\"wonderful\\" tune that Heggie had dreamt up for \\"The best time of the day\\". The duets of Facing Forward/Looking Back were so wonderful that one could talk about them for days. \\"Mother in the mirror\\" was as side-splittingly funny as \\"Facing forward\\" was lovely - to not enjoy this setting of Heggie's own words would be impossible, particularly when it was performed by Frederica von Stade and Joyce DiDonato. Von Stade's mezzo-soprano blended with DiDonato's perfectly, just as it did with Susan Graham's. In Here and Gone, Heggie had a baritone, Keith Phares, who could make a laundry list sound appealing. But the text of the cycle was anything but lightweight. Heggie was one of the few composers brave enough to tell a story about a man trying to reestablish a friendship from which he had recoiled because of a fear of homosexuality. Songs and Sonnets of Ophelia exemplified Heggie's philosophy that love, irrespective of the shape that it took, was the most important thing in the world. Isabel Bayrakdarian sang the cycle with \\"the touch of youth\\" and, in \\"Spring\\", with \\"one of the softest pianissimos [that Serinus had] ever heard on disc\\". Armistead Maupin (left) and his husband, Christopher Turner The last track on the album, a setting of the monologue that concluded Terrence McNally's play about Maria Callas, was allocated to Joyce DiDonato. She \\"[transcended] the temptation to wallow in maudlin self-pity, bringing far more beauty to the scene than [Serinus expected] Callas would have done in real life\\". The speech that McNally had written for Callas entreated her student to sing \\"properly and honestly\\". Heggie and his colleagues had obeyed that injunction and done much more beside. Their album was \\"a very special recording\\". David Patrick Stearns reviewed the album in the Philadelphia Inquirer. He wondered \\"what on Earth [was] going on\\", he wrote, when he found himself listening to \\"a wacky tango characterizing a woman arguing with her dead mother - with mom answering back\\". Some people might wonder whether this item qualified as a song at all, but Susan Graham and Frederica von Stade manifestly enjoyed singing it and made for a happy partnership. The duet exemplified the wide spectrum of literature from which Heggie had chosen his texts, with Terrence McNally's play Master Class adding some prose to the album's poetry. The CD's second cycle of duets, Here and Gone, composed for a tenor, a baritone and a piano quartet, was engagingly reminiscent of Ralph Vaughan Williams's On Wenlock Edge.https://www.startribune.com/classical- music-reviews-passing-by-songs-by-jake-heggie-arvo-part/104534584/ Heggie's music could be accused of being old-fashioned, and he was perhaps too self- effacing in his piano accompaniments. But his cast of vocal luminaries performed as well as anyone could wish.

Rogal ≈õwiƒôtomarci≈Ñski, St. Martin's croissants By EC regulation No 1070/2008 of 30 October 2008, the name rogal ≈õwiƒôtomarci≈Ñski was entered in the register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications in the European Union. History This tradition dates back to pagan times, when during the autumn feast the gods were offered sacrifices of oxen or, as a substitute, of dough rolled up in oxen horns. The Latin Church has taken over this custom and linked it to the figure of St Martin. The shape of the dough was interpreted as a reference to the horseshoe that the holy horse was to lose. In Pozna≈Ñ, the tradition of baking 'rogal ≈õwiƒôtomarci≈Ñski' on 11 November certainly existed in 1860, when the oldest known advertisement for the 'rogal ≈õwiƒôtomarci≈Ñski' was published in Dziennik Pozna≈Ñski. However, there is a popular legend that the tradition in its present form was born in November 1891. As St. Martin's Day was approaching, the parish priest of St. Martin's parish, Fr Jan Lewicki, appealed to the faithful to do something for the poor, following the example of the patron saint. The confectioner J√≥zef Melzer, who was present at the mass and worked in a nearby confectionery, persuaded his boss to revive the old tradition. The wealthier Pozna≈Ñ residents bought a delicacy and the poor received it for free. The custom of baking in 1901 was taken over by the Association of Confectioners. After the First World War, Franciszek RƒÖczy≈Ñski returned to the tradition of giving gifts to the poor, and after the Second World War, Zygmunt Wasi≈Ñski saved the croissant from oblivion. Ingredients The filling must consist of white poppy seeds, vanilla, crushed dates or figs, raisins and cream. Rogal ≈õwiƒôtomarci≈Ñski is coated with a sugar icing and sprinkled with ground nuts.

He is a research director at the CNRS and works at the Institut de biologie physico- chimique (IBPC) in Paris. He is a member of the French Academy of sciences. His grandparents, Eug√®ne and Elisabeth Wollman, researchers at the Pasteur Institute, were the pioneers of discoveries on phage and lysogeny (Andr√© Lwoff's later work earned him the Nobel Prize in 1965). Their work was brutally interrupted in December 1943 following their arrest by the French police and their murder in Auschwitz (a prize from the Academy of Sciences is dedicated to them). His father Elijah Wollman, also a researcher at the Pasteur Institute, of which he was deputy director for many years, was one of the pioneers of bacterial genetics and brought to light the genetic nature of prophecy and the sexuality of bacteria. This last work was done in collaboration with Fran√ßois Jacob, who was awarded the Nobel Prize, also in 1965.  Biography  After studying physico-chemistry at university, he received a scholarship from the D√©l√©gation G√©n√©rale √† la Recherche Scientifique et Technique (DGRST) in 1975 to study biological membranes. In 1977 he completed his PhD at the University of Paris VII (now Paris Diderot), followed in 1982 by a State Thesis (Habilitation) at the same University. He spent his entire career at the CNRS, where he was appointed Director of Exceptional Class Research in 2005 after having joined in 1980 as a research associate. He does all his scientific research at the IBPC in Paris, a research establishment founded in 1927 where he joined Pierre Joliot's laboratory in 1975. From 1998 to 2018, he will head this laboratory, which has become a joint CNRS-Universit√©-Pierre et Marie Curie research unit, under the title \\"Physiologie Membranaire et Mol√©culaire du Chloroplaste\\" (UMR7141). At the same time, in 2007, he was appointed Director of the Institute of Physical and Chemical Biology, a position he held until 2018. In 2012, he also became Director of the \\"Labex DYNAMO\\" Laboratory of Excellence, which brings together biologists and chemists working at the IBPC at the Coll√®ge de France and the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure on different aspects of biogenesis, the function and evolution of energy-transmitting membranes. Very committed to the defence of public research, whose cultural, educational and economic dimensions seem essential to the country's influence, he presided over the Plant Biology section of the National Committee for Scientific Research from 2000 to 2004, then sat on the High Council for Research and Technology from 2005 to 2014 and on the CNRS Scientific Council from 2014 to 2018. In 2004, he actively participated in the \\"Save Research\\" movement and became a member of the board of the Initiative and Proposal Committee (CIP), led by Etienne-Emile Baulieu and Edouard Brezin (President and Vice-President of the French Academy of sciences), which organizes the Etats G√©n√©raux de la Recherche in Grenoble.  Scientific work  Francis-Andr√© Wollman's scientific work has been devoted to the biogenesis, regulation and evolution of oxygen photosynthesis. Using the power of the genetic approach in a microalgae, Chlamydomonas reinhartdii, he combined biophysical, biochemical and structural biology approaches to establish an exhaustive mapping of the composition of photosynthesis proteins and their supramolecular organization within photosynthetic membranes.Wollman F.A., Mina√Ø L. & Nechushta√Ø R., ¬´ The biogenesis and assembly of photosynthetic proteins in thylakoid membranes ¬ª, Biochim.

Life Oudart was born in Mechelin, and was brought to England by Sir Henry Wotton for his household. He was created M.A. at Oxford on 13 August 1636, and was incorporated at Cambridge in 1639. He went on to study medicine and was created M.B. at Oxford on 31 January 1642. In 1640 Oudart was at The Hague as secretary to Sir William Boswell, the English ambassador; in 1641 he became assistant secretary to Sir Edward Nicholas, Secretary of State. Sir Edward left England in 1646, but Oudart remained, sending Sir Edward letters with secret messages that used lemon juice as invisible ink. In August 1647 Oudart was acting as amanuensis to Charles I; he attended the king in the conferences with the parliamentary commissioners at Newport, Isle of Wight, and wrote the king's despatch to his son Charles. Around 1651, Oudart became secretary to Princess Mary of Orange, a post he held until her death in 1661. Nicholas declared (about 1655) that Oudart's preferments had made him conceited. Returning to England, Oudart was admitted gentleman of the privy chamber on 18 November 1662; on 13 July 1666 he became Latin secretary to Charles II in succession to Sir Richard Fanshawe, and held the position to the end of his life. He made frequent journeys to the Netherlands. In February 1666 a warrant was ordered for the payment to Sir George Downing and his secretary Oudart of their expenses during their imprisonment in Holland, which had occurred when they were caught up in tit-for-tat of the Second Anglo-Dutch War. Oudart was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1667, and knew John Evelyn and Samuel Pepys. He died in Little Dean's Yard, Westminster, and was buried in the west cloister of Westminster Abbey on 21 December 1681. His will, dated 5 March 1671‚Äì2, was proved on 13 July 1682 by his widow. Works Francis Peck printed in his Desiderata Curiosa Oudart's eye-witness account of the Treaty of Newport negotiations of 1648 between King and Parliament. A copy of Eikon Basilike, in the handwriting of Oudart, was used by the printer Richard Royston. Family Oudart married in 1655 Eva, daughter of John Fran√ßois Tortarolis, a wealthy gentlewoman of Leyden whom Oudart married about 1655. Of three daughters of the marriage, Barbara married at the Temple Church, London in 1677 William Foster; Amelia Isabella married in 1689 Bartholomew Van Sittert; and Dorothy is not known to have married.

She has been heavily awarded and recognized for her work in archives and libraries across the country in speeches and presentations and has written extensively on women's history, local history and the archival profession.\\"Marchand Marie Finnegan (1931-).\\" Biography and Genealogy Master Index. Ed. Jeffrey Muhr. Detroit: Gale, 2016. Biography and Genealogy Master Index. Gale.  Career  She began working at the University Archives at the University at Buffalo in 1967. She was instrumental in developing the Archives, gathering documents from attics, closets, and other storage spaces. She actively pursued many of the collections that make up the Archives today, including the records of women's history at Buffalo and Western New York. Her work and research in women's and local history and archival organization has helped the University Archives immensely and even led to several papers and presentations. In 1979, she was awarded the Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Librarianship. During her long career in archives, she also served as a member of the Board of Managers of the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society. Finnegan also served as Director of the Buffalo Community Studies Group. She was appointed to the New York State Historical Records Advisory Board by Governor Cuomo and served there from 1976-1985. Since 1968, Finnegan has been a member of the Society of American Archivists, making connections that encouraged her to become an active archivist and even co-founding MARAC and LOAC. She has served on many committees and task forces and has been heavily involved in the Committee on Status of Women in the Archival Profession and the Committee of College and University Archives. In 1975, she was elected as a Fellow, the Society's highest honor and from 1980-1984, she served on the National Archives Advisory Council as a representative of the SAA.

It also allows players to create and share their own custom adventure settings. The game's first version was made available on Colab in May 2019, and its second version (initially called AI Dungeon 2) was released online and for iOS & Android in December 2019. The AI model was then upgraded in July 2020.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot from the second version of AI Dungeon (also known as AI Dungeon 2). AI Dungeon is a text adventure game; however, unlike traditional text adventure games, which use pre-written content, AI Dungeon uses artificial intelligence to generate effectively limitless open-ended storylines. When first beginning the game, players are greeted by the following opening: > \\"You're about to enter a world of endless possibilities, where you can do > absolutely anything you can imagine.... Will you proceed?\\" Players are then prompted to choose a setting for their adventure (e.g. fantasy, mystery, apocalyptic, cyberpunk, zombies), followed by other options relevant to the setting (such as character class for fantasy settings). After beginning an adventure, there are three main interaction methods that can be chosen for each of the player's pieces of text input: * Do: Must be followed by a verb, allowing the player to perform an action. * Say: Must be followed by dialog sentences, allowing players to communicate with other characters. * Story: Can be followed by sentences describing something that happens to progress the story, or that players want the AI to know for future events. The game's artificial intelligence allows it to adapt and respond to almost any action entered by the player. Providing blank input can also be used to prompt the AI to generate further content.  User-generated content  In addition to the pre-configured settings available in AI Dungeon, players also have the ability to create entirely custom \\"adventures\\" from scratch, simply by describing the setting in text format. The AI will then generate a setting, based on the user's input. Custom adventures that players create can also be published for others to play through in their own way. The game provides an interface for browsing published adventures, along with the ability to leave comments and upvote/like each one.  Multiplayer  AI Dungeon also features a multiplayer mode, whereby different players each have a dedicated character, and can take turns interacting with the AI within the same game session. This supports both online play across multiple devices or local \\"pass-n-play\\" style using a shared device. Unlike the single-player game, in which actions and stories use second person narration (\\"you...\\"), multiplayer game stories are presented using third-person narration. Each game's host player is given additional permissions (likened to that of a Dungeons & Dragons Dungeon Master) whereby they can supervise the AI and make modifications to its output.  Worlds  AI Dungeon also provides players with the ability to set their adventures within specific 'Worlds', which give context to the broader environment in which the adventure takes place. This feature was first released with two different worlds available for selection: * \\"Xaxas is a world of peace and prosperity. It is a land in which all races live together in harmony.\\" * \\"Kedar is a world of dragons, demons, and monsters.\\"  Premium features  The game also features additional functionality for players who pay for a monthly premium subscription, such as: * Access to the advanced Dragon AI model. *Text-to-speech functionality to provide audio narration. * Custom scripts when creating adventures. * The ability to configure advanced settings, such as the length and randomness level of responses.  Artbreeder content  AI Dungeon also provides the ability for players to select a premade avatar for themselves which were generated by Artbreeder, an artificial intelligence website which uses generative adversarial network (GAN) technology to combine and synthesize images.  Development   AI Dungeon Classic (Early GPT-2)  Screenshot from the first version of AI Dungeon (also known as AI Dungeon Classic). The first version of AI Dungeon (sometimes referred to as AI Dungeon Classic) was designed and created by Nick Walton of Brigham Young's 'Perception, Control, and Cognition' deep learning laboratory in March 2019, during a hackathon. Before this, Walton had been working as an intern for several companies working in the field of autonomous vehicles. This creation used an early version of the GPT-2 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 2) natural-language- generating neural network, created by OpenAI, allowing it to generate its own original adventure narratives. During his first interactions with GPT-2, Walton was partly inspired by the tabletop game Dungeons & Dragons (D&D;), which he had played for the first time with his family a few months earlier: > ‚ÄúI realized that there were no games available that gave you the same > freedom to do anything that I found in [Dungeons & Dragons] ... You can be > so creative compared to other games.\\" This led him to the question: > \\"What if you could make an AI dungeon master?\\" However, despite this focus on player freedom, unlike later versions of AI Dungeon, the original did not allow players to specify any action they wanted. Instead, it generated them a finite list of possible actions to choose from. This first version of the game was released to the public in May 2019. It was released within Google Colab (an online Google tool for data scientists and AI researchers, which allows for free execution of code on Google-hosted machines); however, it required the downloading of the full model for each player (a size of 5 gigabytes at the time). Within days of the initial release, this mandatory download resulted in bandwidth charges of over $20,000, forcing the temporary shut-down of the game until a peer-to-peer alternative solution was established. This initial version is not to be confused with another GPT-2-based adventure game, GPT Adventure, created by Northwestern University neuroscience postgraduate student Nathan Whitmore, trained using 1970s text-based games (such as Zork), and released (also on Google Colab) several months after the public release of AI Dungeon. Reflecting later, in July 2020, on the first version of AI Dungeon, its creator, Walton, stated that: > \\"The first version of AI Dungeon was entertaining in its own wacky way, but > it could almost never form a cohesive story ... it was nothing like what > it‚Äôs become today.\\"  AI Dungeon 2 (Full GPT-2)  In November 2019, a new, 'full' version of GPT-2 was released by OpenAI. This new model included support for 1.5 billion parameters (which determine the accuracy with which a machine learning model can perform a task), compared with the 126 million parameter version used in the earliest stages of AI Dungeon's development. The game was recreated by Walton, leveraging this new version of the model, and temporarily rebranded as AI Dungeon 2. AI Dungeon 2's AI was given more focused training compared to its predecessor, using genre-specific text. This training material included approximately 30 megabytes of content web-scraped from chooseyourstory.com (an online community website of content inspired by interactive gamebooks, written by contributors of multiple skill levels, using logic of differing complexity) and multiple D&D; rulebooks & adventures. Initially, the new version was released as open source; however, in December 2019, it became closed source and was relaunched by Walton's startup development team, Latitude (with Walton taking on the role of CTO). This relaunch included both a new web-based interface on December 5 and mobile apps for iOS & Android (built by app developer Braydon Batungbacal) on December 17. Other members of this team included Thorsten Kreutz for the game's long-term strategy, and the creator's brother, Alan Walton, for hosting infrastructure. At this time, Nick Walton also established a Patreon campaign to support the game's further growth (such as addition of multiplayer and voice support, along with longer-term plans to include music and image content) and turn the game into a commercial endeavor, which Walton felt was necessary in order to cover the costs of delivering a high-quality version of the game. AI Dungeon was one of the only commercial applications to be based upon GPT-2. Following its first announcement in December 2019, a multiplayer mode was added to the game in April 2020. Hosting a game in this play mode was originally restricted to premium subscribers (although any players could join a hosted game); however, it was made a free feature in July 2020.  Dragon model release (GPT-3)  In July 2020, the developers introduced a premium-exclusive version of the AI model, named Dragon, which uses OpenAI's new API for leveraging the GPT-3 model without maintaining a local copy (released on June 11, 2020). GPT-3 was trained with 570 gigabytes of text content (approximately one trillion words, with a $12 million development cost) and can support 175 billion parameters, compared to the 40GB of training content and 1.5 billion parameters of GPT-2. This upgrade allowed AI Dungeon to maintain a much more coherent story than previously possible. The free model was also upgraded to GPT-3, albeit a less advanced version, and was named Griffin. Speaking shortly after this release, on the differences between GPT-2 and GPT-3, Walton stated: > \\"[GPT-3 is] one of the most powerful AI models in the world ... It's just > much more coherent in terms of understanding who the characters are, what > they‚Äôre saying, what‚Äôs going on in the story and just being able to write an > interesting and believable story.\\" In the latter half of 2020, the 'Worlds' feature was added to AI Dungeon, providing an overarching world in which players' adventures can take place.  Reception  Approximately two thousand people played the original version of the game within the first month of its May 2019 release. By contrast, within a week of its December 2019 relaunch, the game reached over 100,000 players and over 500,000 play-throughs, and reached 1.5 million players by June 2020. As of December 2019, the game's corresponding Patreon campaign was raising approximately $15,000 per month.  GPT-2 edition reviews  In his January 2020 review of the GPT-2-powered version of AI Dungeon (known at the time as AI Dungeon 2), Craig Grannell of Stuff Magazine named it 'App of the Week' and awarded it 4 out of 5 stars. Grannell praised the game's flexibility and its custom story feature, but criticised the abrupt shifts in content that were common in the GPT-2 edition of the game: > [AI Dungeon is] an endless world of dreamlike storytelling, and a > fascinating glimpse into the future of AI. Campbell Bird of 148Apps also awarded this edition of the game 4 out of 5 stars in his review, also praising its creativity whilst criticising the lack of memory for previous content: > AI Dungeon is like doing improv with a partner who is equal parts > enthusiastic and drunk ... [It] is a game that‚Äôs charming, occasionally > frustrating, but mostly just impressive in its raw creativity and spirit. Jon Mundy of TapSmart awarded it a 3 out of 5 star rating, similarly praising its variety and the \\"magical\\" custom adventure option, but described its adventure narratives as \\"often too passive and vague\\" and lacking in resolution.  Creating non-game content  In addition to those who used AI Dungeon for its primary purpose as a game, other users experimented with using its language generation interface to create other forms of content that would not be found in traditional games (primarily via the custom adventure option). Although the game was primarily trained using text adventures, training content for the GPT models themselves included large amounts of web content (including the entirety of the English-language Wikipedia), thereby allowing the game to adapt to areas outside of this core focus. Examples of AI Dungeon being used in this way include it: * Co-writing an article discussing GPT-3 itself. * Responding to philosophical essays written on GPT-3. * Having a discussion with a psychologist. * Fabricating an interview discussion on ethics. * Participating in its own therapy session. * Allowing interaction with fictional versions of celebrities. * Posting content to a fictional version of Instagram.

Named after Alan Turing, the game itself is advertised as Turing complete, and can (abstractly) duplicate the processes of any computer whatsoever if the game field were sufficiently large. It is also PSPACE complete by the circuit value problem, and in its method of operation has implications for nanotechnology. Although it resembles a pachinko machine in its aesthetic use of gravity-fed metal balls, it is primarily a teaching device in the fundamentals of logic-computer programming, and as such is an example of gamification. The framing device in the included comic book features an astronaut who must solve fifty increasingly difficult logic problems which illustrate the fundamentals of computer programming. The impetus of the puzzle itself was the frustration of the programmer and chemistry professor Paul Boswell (along with his wife, Alyssa Boswell, a DIY maker), then at the University of Minnesota, at the lack of computing prowess of other scientists which was necessary for their own projects; he was already well known for programming complex games for Texas Instruments computers. They were also inspired by the Digi-Comp II, a precursor from the late 1960s.  Construction  A turning tumble machine has the following parts: * Ball drops.The standard version uses two ramps which stores a given number of balls. A switch at the bottom of the board triggers the release of the initial ball (typically blue), from the top left of the panel. The second ramp, on the right, contains red balls. * Ramps and crossovers. The green ramp allows the balls to run down it one way and release it in only that direction, whereas the orange crossover lets balls traverse it to either side both ways, i.e. from right to left and _vice versa_. * Interceptors. This black piece stops a ball. * Bits. This is a one-bit storage: it changes direction when a ball rolls through, such that the next ball goes to the other side. * Gear and gear bits. Gear bits are exactly like regular bits, but they can be connected to gears. The gears allow for linking state changes, thus integrally adding extra (abstract) power.  Reception  Critically it has received high praise for its concept and execution, albeit with some caveats (the recommended age being 8+). The computing game has won the Parents' Choice Gold Award, and won in the category Best Toys of the Year 2018 under the aegis American Specialty Toy Retailing Association. It is also STEMI approved.

She is considered a leading indigenous filmmaker.  Biography  She graduated with a master's degree in sociology and later pursued a career in documentary filmmaking. O'Bomsawin has co-written on the docu-series Skindigenous and has written and directed La ligne rouge in 2014, Kirano in 2015, Quiet Killing (Ce silence qui tue) in 2017, Du Teweikan √† l‚Äô√©lectro in 2017 and Call Me Human (Je m'appelle humain) in 2020.  Film career   Skindigenous  Skindigenous aired in Canada in 2018. The docu-series conveys that tattoos are an ancient art and not relegated to one continent or one set group of people. The producers travel around the world to seek out and learn how ancient tribal heritage is carried into today as part of a tattoo culture. Each episode covers a particular part of the world and the people practicing this unique art.  La ligne rouge, The Red Line  The Red Line is Kim O'Bomsawin's first film. The film explores hockey as a practice in Quebec's aboriginal communities. The documentary has a specific focus on Amy-L√©a, Mikisew and Fr√©d√©rik, who like many young Canadians give everything to hockey. The title pertains to the internal conflict these players face while making heart- wrenching choices between cultural practices and the sport. The film also sheds light on how sports prevent delinquency which persist in low-income First Nation communities.  Kirano, Rays  Kirano is a web documentary that follows the story of 10 aboriginal personalities, most notably rapper Samian, politician Alexis Wawanoloath and snowboard athlete Caroline Calv√©. All 10 of the featured people are asked to answer: How to define yourself as indigenous in 2015. O'Bomsawin creatively divides this film into 10 video clips that are available online.  Ce silence qui tue, Quiet Killing  Quiet Killing is O'Bomsawin's most notable film, for its firsthand accounts of the many missing and murdered indigenous women in Canada. Through this film, O'Bomsawin humanizes a social injustice that is largely unaddressed.  Du Teweikan √† l‚Äô√©lectro, From Teweikan to Electro  Most recently, O'Bomsawin created a project called From Teweikan to Electro, which celebrates the value of unifying through the sound of vibrations. In the film project she features singer-songwriters Pakesso Mukash (Cri / Abenaki), Shauit (Innu) and Moe Clark (M√©tis) whom obatina foothold in the fold elector and reggae music communities and strive to create connections between generations, the living and the dead, territories, conquered and rebellious. O'Bomsawin commits this project to tracing the history of First Nation music.  Political activism  Besides her consistent dedication to amplifying the voices of First Nation people in her documentary films, Kim O'Bomsawin extends her activism to ensure that indigenous people are represented and respected in the world of art. She spoke on the importance of representation in her critique of playwright Robert Lepage's Kanata. The play aimed to cover the history of the relationship between white and indigenous people in Canada, but it was cancelled in July 2017 after more than 30 members of the Canadian Indigenous community, including Kim O'Bomsawin, wrote an open letter to Montreal's Le Devoir newspaper denouncing Lepage for not including indigenous performers in the show. In an interview she says, \\"I thought, 'Maybe with the experience I have, I can talk some sense into (Lepage), to make him see what it represents on a human scale ‚Äî the pain of people.' Is it really necessary (to exclude indigenous actors), in the name of art? Sure you have the right, but is it really necessary?\\" Recently O'Bomsawin commented on the blackface scandal of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, stating how it was shocking to see the Canadian leader in blackface.

It is thought to date from the time of the Danelaw in 9th- century England and is a shire oak, a tree that was used as a meeting point for local assemblies. The wapentake (Danish local assembly) in this area was known as the Skyrack wapentake after the tree. The Shire Oak was felled by winds in 1941 and a plaque now marks the place that it once stood.  History  The Skyrack wapentake is formed of the divisions marked 7 and 9 on this map of the West Riding of Yorkshire Headingley has its origins in a Danish settlement established in the late 9th century, that formed part of the Danelaw. The settlement formed part of the Skyrack Wapentake (an administrative division similar to the Anglo-Saxon hundred) and it is believed that the wapentake assembly met at the Shire Oak. Meetings at shire oaks were common across England at this time. The Skyrack Wapentake is thought to have taken its name from the association with the tree (which would have been referred to as the scƒ´r ƒÅc in the language of the time), as most wapentakes were named after their meeting place. The Skyrack Wapentake would have met regularly to resolve legal disputes, make decisions and to muster for war. Local legend dates the tree even earlier, to the time of the ancient British druids, who were said to have revered the tree. As Headingley grew the oak was incorporated into Otley Road and Saint Michael's Church was constructed to the south of it. Two pubs opposite the church, the Skyrack and the Original Oak were both named after the tree. A drawing of the tree was made circa 1700, at which time it was described as ancient and Edward Parsons, writing in 1834, described it as already 1,000 years old. However, by the late 19th century the Shire Oak had decayed to little more than a stump and it fell during a gale on 26 May 1941. The remains of the tree were removed, but part was sculpted by the \\"Mouseman\\" Robert Thompson into the likeness of the Madonna and child,http://www.leodis.net/display.aspx?id=2004225_3025454 which is now displayed in St Michael's Church.

Life Born in Munich, he studied not only under his father Johann Schraudolph but also under Hermann Ansch√ºtz and Johann Georg Hiltensperger. He was a student assistant to the painters of Speyer Cathedral and initially specialised in religious paintings before switching to genre painting in 1866.

History The Prodigal Son (far left) in Barnard's studio outside Paris, 1908 Love and Labor: The Unbroken Law (installed 1911). Barnard was awarded the most important commission of his career in 1902, the sculpture groups for the Pennsylvania State Capitol. He left his teaching position at the Art Students League of New York in spring 1903, and moved to Paris.\\"George Grey Barnard (1863‚Äì1938),\\" in Lauretta Dimmick and Donna J. Hassler. American Sculpture in the Metropolitan Museum of Art: A catalogue of works by artists born before 1865. Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1999. pp. 421‚Äì27. Barnard and his assistants toiled for nearly eight years on the twenty-seven figures in the sculpture groups. One of the first sculptures completed was The Prodigal Son--in 1904, while his assistants were modeling the twice-life-size version of it in clay, Barnard was pointing and carving the reduced-size version in marble. The completed groups in plaster were shipped to New York City in 1909, to be carved in marble by Furio Piccirilli. The marble groups were completed in early 1910,\\"American Types in Symbolic Art,\\" The Literary Digest, (11 June 1910), p. 1179. and shipped back to France to make their debut at the Salon des Artistes Francais, at the end of April.\\"French Enthusiasm over Barnard's Sculpture,\\" The Craftsman, vol. 19, no. 2 (November 1910), pp. 212-214. Gustav Stickley's magazine The Craftsman printed nearly two pages of rave reviews, translated from French, that Barnard received for the Pennsylvania State Capitol sculpture groups. Pennsylvania State Capitol The Prodigal Son and the other fifteen marble sculpture groups were shipped back to the United States, and installed by the Piccirilli Brothers on either side of the main entrance to the Pennsylvania State Capitol, April-May 1911. Some Pennsylvania legislators and local religious leaders objected to the nudity of Barnard's sculptures.Robert Swift, \\"The Price of Prudity in 1911,\\" The Political Express, September 25, 2011. He responded: > There has been some criticism, because these 30 figures I have executed are > nude. Only in the nude could I have given adequate expression to these > figures. Drapery would have spoiled the effect. Only through delineation of > the nude human form can great emotions be shown. You cannot drape a symbolic > figure in an overcoat and expect it to be anything but a marble dummy. > It is curious that this criticism should come from men, while women approve > of the work as is. Women have better artistic sense than men. They are > inspired by the human form, but men are not similarly inspired. They think > the nude suggestive. I understand that the Pennsylvania state authorities > are going to drape them. I shall make no protest, but I am sorry.\\"Defends > Nude in Statuary,\\" The Alexandria Gazette, April 25, 1911, p. 1. Initially, plaster of Paris short trousers were applied to the male figures, but the results proved unsatisfactory. Two tents were erected on Friday, May 12, one around each sculpture group, to mask that day's removal of the plaster trousers. On Sunday, the canvas walls of the tents were cut down by art-lovers who wished to view the sculptures before plaster loincloths were applied on Monday--\\"the great majority of the crowd being women,\\" according to The Chicago Tribune.\\"Women in Fight to See Nude Art,\\" The Chicago Tribune, May 15, 1911, p. 2. Instead of short trousers or loincloths, the Piccirilli Brothers carved marble sheaths to cover the genitals of the male figures, for which they charged $118.50. Speed Art Museum The other twice-life-size Prodigal Son was also carved in marble by Florio Piccirilli, and is dated 1909.John F. Martin, \\"The Story of the Prodigal Son,\\" J. B. Speed Art Museum Bulletin, vol. 31, no. 1 (September 1976), pp. 14-24. This remained in Barnard's possession for a decade, until he sold it in 1919. It was donated to the J. B. Speed Art Museum in 1939. Carnegie Museum of Art The Carnegie Museum of Art's Prodigal Son was carved in France by Barnard, and is marked \\"Moret-sur-Loing / 1906.\\" He later wrote that it was \\"one of my most carefully finished marbles,\\" and that \\"the delicate surfaces proper to a small figure ‚Ä¶ are not necessary to the larger works.\\" Diana Strazdes, primary author of the museum's 1992 catalogue of paintings and sculpture, contrasted Auguste Rodin's Prodigal Son with Barnard's: Photograph from Barnard's 1908 one-man exhibition, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston > While Rodin chose to show the son alone, overcome with despair and yearning > for forgiveness, Barnard selected the moment of reconciliation from the > biblical story and replaced Rodin's darker, more psychologically complex > tone with a mood of hope and promise. Here, the father bends protectively > over the son. The embrace of their arms makes a complete circle; the two > bodies intertwine as one, successfully symbolizing the idea of forgiveness > and humility in the face of love. Exhibition history A plaster of The Prodigal Son was shown in Barnard's one-man exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, November-December 1908.\\"An American Sculptor,\\" The Outlook, New York, November 28, 1908, pp. 655-656. The twice-life-size marble (for the Pennsylvania State Capitol) was exhibited at the Salon des Artistes Francais, Paris, April-May 1910. Barnard exhibited his twice-life-size marble (now at the Speed Art Museum) at the 1913 Armory Show in New York City, along with four sculpture groups from his Urn of Life.Milton Brown, \\"Armory Show 1913 Complete List,\\" from New York Historical Society.

Family  Robertson's parents were the actors William Ross (died 1781) and his wife Elizabeth, later Mrs John Brown (died 1823).Wright, p. 134Highfill, p. 110 Her younger sister Anna Ross married the actor-manager John Brunton (1741‚Äì1819). Anna and John's eldest daughter was the actress Elizabeth Yates, and John's sister Louisa Brunton, another actress, married Major-General William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven. Her half-brothers John Mills Brown, Henry Brown and half-sister Mary Clarke ( Brown) were also actors who had appeared with her on the Lincoln Circuit.Playbills in Wisbech & Fenland Museum She married Thomas Shaftoe Robertson, actor and manager, on 8 September 1793. They had at least three children, Richard Shaftoe (b. 1794), Thomas Shaftoe (b. 1795) and John (b. 1796).England, Lincolnshire, Parish Registers, 1538‚Äì1990Wright, p. 109 A nephew was William Shaftoe Robertson, whose most famous children were the playwright T. W. Robertson and the actress Dame Madge Kendal.  Acting career  Robertson performed at the Theatre Royal, Norwich, in the 1770s, 1780s and 1790s, often with her sister and other family members. At a benefit performance on 2 May 1791 in Norwich, she appeared as Euphrasia in The Grecian Daughter. Her future husband Thomas Shaftoe Robertson and \\"Jemmy\\" Miller ran the Lincoln Circuit of theatres until 2 May 1796, when Miller sold out to Tom, who entered into partnership with Robert Henry Franklin. The theatre venues in the Circuit varied over time, but at some point included theatres in Lincoln, Boston, Grantham, Peterborough, Newark, Oundle, Spalding, Huntingdon, Wisbech, and other nearby towns.Pemberton, p. 20 Audience behaviour could be unruly, and on occasion her husband had to take steps to protect Fanny and other actors, as recounted in this newspaper report: Robertson's long career as actor and manager enabled her to work with several generations of actors, including child actor William Henry West Betty, who performed in the Georgian theatre in Wisbech in 1808. Over 30 years later Fanny Robertson brought his son, Henry Betty, to perform at her Spalding theatre in October 1839. In April 1810 she appeared with John Quick at Wisbech as Julia in The Way to Married, as Roasalind in As You Like It, and as Letitia Hardy in The Belle's Stratagem, finally as the widow Belmour in The Way to Keep Him.The handbills are in the Wisbech & Fenland Museum collection. In November 1813 she performed as Donna Violante opposite Charles Kemble as Don Felix in The Wonder! A Woman Keeps a Secret! at the Theatre, Newark. She performed opposite Edmund Kean as Portia and Shylock in The Merchant of Venice in Lincoln in 1824, where he also played the title characters in Richard III, Othello and Hamlet. He returned to appear in The Merchant of Venice in Boston and Wisbech in April 1831. She performed as Ophelia opposite William Macready in Hamlet in September 1828 in Lincoln and again in June 1836 in Wisbech and Peterborough to open a five week season. Another West End actor brought by Robertson to perform at Wisbech and other Lincoln Circuit venues was Henry Compton. A critic wrote that his performance as Touchstone in As You Like It and as Mawwarm in Isaac Bickerstaff's The Hypocrite \\"was capital, he kept the audience in one tumult of laughter from beginning to end\\". When her husband was put in Lincoln Castle Gaol for debt in 1817, supporters aided them by putting on amateur productions and purchasing the theatrical travelling property sold by auction, and appointing him their manager.Handbill in the collection at Wisbech & Fenland Museum. Some landlords even reduced the rents of their theatres, according to a handbill promoting Speed the Plough and Chip of the Old Block, to be performed on 7 April 1817 at the theatre in Wisbech.Handbill in the collection at Wisbech & Fenland Museum. Theatre management and later years Fanny inherited the Lincoln Circuit, when widowed in 1831, and announced that her nephew William Roberson would conduct the acting management and that his wife Margaretta would make her first appearance as a singer in Lincoln on 28 September. This also coincided with the installation of gas lighting in the theatre. Fanny shortened her company's seasons at the Lincoln Circuit theatres and added short stops for fairs and race weeks; she also wrote and produced the plays The Nun (1833) at Lincoln in November 1833, and Louis XIII (1836) in December 1836.Wright, p. 207 The corn merchant James Hill (father of Octavia Hill and Miranda Hill) bought the Georgian theatre in Wisbech and adjoining land in 1835 and started to invest money in the theatre and in further developing the site.\\"Octavia Hill\\", The Wisbech Society and Preservation Trust. Retrieved 6 July 2020 On 27 June 1840 James Hill and Thomas Hill went bankrupt and their estates were sold by auction, including the Wisbech theatre, which Fanny Robertson was then leasing. The changing tastes of patrons may be evident from an advert in the Stamford Mercury: \\"Mrs T. Robertson had just entered upon the occupancy of Stamford Theatre and announced her intention to commence a season starting on 5th October 1841 (the next race day). She also announced a series of grand MUSICAL and INSTRUMENTAL CONCERTS by artists from the Gloucester Festival, to be held in Boston on 19th September and Lincoln on 21st and for race week. Theatrical performances in Peterborough for the Fair nights and to return for 2nd, 4th and 9th due to their commitment to Stamford Race week (5th to 8th October) and a five week season.\\" After the Guy Fawkes Night performance of King John and Mary, the Maid of the Inn at Stamford, the vocalists Elizabeth Inverarity, her husband Charles Martyn, his sister, Mr Frazer and Mr Stretton toured Peterborough, Wisbech, Boston and Lincoln with musical concerts in November 1841. At the Wisbech theatre the attendance was very bad, as was the weather. The Wisbech theatre had been \\"lately fitted up and decorated at great expense, for the purpose of public assemblies and concerts\\" when it was offered for sale by auction at the White Hart Inn on 2 May 1843. Robertson continued as a tenant In April 1843, The Theatre wrote: \\"On Monday evening our theatrical friends took leave of us. Mrs. Robertson had her farewell benefit, having resigned the management to her nephew, Mr. W. Robertson. She appeared in the character of Lady Eleanor Irwin, in Elizabeth Inchbald's comedy Everyone has his Fault after which she delivered a very neat and appropriate address. There was a full house, but we are sorry to say the season has been productive of very few even tolerable houses.\\" Robertson retired to Wisbech that year, and her nephew William Robertson became the manager of the family's theatres and theatre company. On 6 November 1843 the Wisbech theatre was again put up for auction \\"in an excellent condition\\". Fanny Robertson made an agreement to sell Huntingdon theatre to James Balfour in 1845.Agreement letter, dated 24 January 1845, in Huntingdonshire Archives KHAC0/24/71 In July 1846 the Robertson theatre company performed a play Mind how you Wed! written by Dr Whitsed, a local GP and later mayor. In May 1847 Mr Davenport, manager of several Norfolk theatres, took a season at the Wisbech theatre and held a benefit night for Robertson. By 1848 the Robertson theatre company was reported to have been entirely broken up. Robertson, aged 80, was in a state of such poverty that Huntingdon and other towns on the Circuit opened subscription lists to remedy the situation. A concert at the Wisbech theatre by the Wisbech Harmonic Society and Mr. T. Macklin of King's College Chapel to raise funds for an annuity for Robertson was arranged in May 1848. This was apparently successful, as the 1851 census records that she was then \\"an annuitant living on her own in Norfolk Street West, Wisbech.\\" 1851 Census, England and Wales Robertson died in 1855 in Wisbech, attended by her friend Dr. Whitsted.  Legacy  William Hilton, a son of the portrait painter William Hilton Snr of Lincoln, one of the company's scenery painters, was encouraged by Robertson to pursue a career as an artist; he rose to become a Royal Academician and, in gratitude for her assistance, later painted Fanny Robertson in the role of Beatrice. In 1866 the painting was in the Wisbech Working Men's Institute. William Hilton Snr was credited on theatre handbills for creating scenery for the Robertsons from 1818 to the 1820s.Handbill for The Carib Chief, 5 May 1820, collection of Wisbech & Fenland Museum The Wisbech & Fenland Museum has a collection of over two hundred theatre posters, handbills and other items from the Georgian theatre in Wisbech. A small collection is also held by the Angles Theatre. The Wisbech theatre reopened in the 1970s as the Angles Theatre. Its bar was named Macready's but was later changed to \\"The Lincoln Circuit\\", to commemorate the theatre circuit run by Robertson and her family.

It was opened in June 1899.  History  The hotel was designed by the Cornish architect, John Sansom, who was part of a practice in Liskeard. He was responsible for designing a number of works in Cornwall, mostly around Liskeard but also the Victoria in Newquay, the Porthminster Hotel, St. Ives, and various schools and churches. Construction of the hotel, by Lang and Sons of Liskeard, started in 1897 and was completed on 22 July 1897, three years before the Headland Hotel, built by rival architect Sylvanus Trevail. The Hotel Victoria owners included a number of council members who placed difficulties in the way of Trevail so that the Victoria would be completed first. This enabled them to promote their investment as the largest hotel in Newquay. The hotel officially opened on 1 June 1899. Afterwards the Headland would be promoted as the largest in the West of England. A feature of the Victoria was the lift that could connect every floor to the bathing beaches below, claimed to be the only one in England.

She is known for tackling taboo subjects and raising controversial questions in her plays. Early life Khoury was born in Trieste, Italy in 1976 from a Lebanese father and a Syrian mother from Assyrian ancestry. Khoury grew up in an era defined by Lebanon‚Äôs civil war. In 1997 Khoury graduated from the Lebanese American University (LAU), with a B.A. degree in Communication Arts. After working as an actress and assistant director in few television shows and plays as well as hosting two radio shows, Khoury moved to the United States, where she pursued her graduate studies and earned her M.F.A in Theatre Directing from the University of Arkansas (UOA) in 2002. Career Since Khoury moved back to Beirut in 2003, she has taught, given workshops and master classes in Acting, Script Writing and Directing for theatre, Film and Television in various institutions in Beirut, mainly LAU, ALBA, AUST and The Lebanese University. Khoury‚Äôs main work and passion is in theatre. She chooses to work on controversial topics that reflect the society‚Äôs mal functions as she sees it, daring to question inherited beliefs and norms with wit and style. Khoury‚Äôs influence is felt throughout Lebanese contemporary theatre through her adoption of ground breaking view points, and management of talents as Gabriel Yammine, Roula Hmade, Talal El Jourdi, Diamand Bou Aboud, Patricia Namour, Elie Mitri, Nada Abou Farhat, Tarek Tamim and the renowned Ziad Al Rahbani. In 2004 Khoury started working on her first play, Haki Niswan; which premiered in the spring of 2006. It was inspired by Eve Ensler‚Äôs Vagina Monologues and was a pioneer play that tackled taboo subjects in the Lebanese society and the Arab World, mainly those of women's issues and sexual freedom. Haki Niswan took the Lebanese theatrical scene by storm and played for two years (from 2006 till 2008) to full house audiences. Khoury‚Äôs fame rose instantly, as the play had raving reviews from local, national, and international media. In 2009, Khoury wrote, directed and produced Sar Lazem Nihki, a human comedy about relationships between men and women. Majnoun Yehki, was the third major play that Khoury directed and produced; it premiered in 2013. Based on Tom Stoppard‚Äôs EGBDF, it was a musical black comedy which ironically questioned the oppression of regimes and the humanity of individuals. The play featured Ziad Al Rahbani, whom Khoury brought back to the theatre 20 years after his last play. In 2016 Khoury put Issam Mahfouz‚Äôs controversial play Limatha... on stage. Khoury chose to stage this social political tragi-comedy to shed light on the situation of acceptance and numbness of the Lebanese society. In 2018, Khoury wrote, (with the help of writers Fouad Yammine and Rami El Tawil), directed and produced Haki Rjel an Avant-garde Black Comedy, which is a sequel to her hit play Haki Niswan. The play delved into the hidden world of men and related for the first time in Lebanon and the Mena region stories of oppressed men, in a society that is well trenched in masculinity and where women are oppressed and face discrimination on multiple levels. In television, Khoury presented two entertainment shows: El Layle Layltak On LBCI and Men El Ekhir on MTV Lebanon. She also worked as a producer for El Layle Layltak, as well as Hiya wa Houwa and The Investor with MBC in Dubai. Lina was one of the Acting coaches in Arab Casting on Abu Dhabi TV and MTV Lebanon. She also directed and produced corporate videos and video clips in her early days. In film, Khoury was one of the producers for the film Taxi El Balad. She also participates as a jury member in theatre festivals and short film competitions. Independently, Khoury works on various projects as a writer, artistic consultant, acting coach, and drama translator.

He was previously executive director of the Kentucky Baptist Convention (2011-2018) and president of the Kentucky Baptist Convention (2005-2006). Born in LaFollette, Tennessee, Chitwood graduated from Cumberland College (now the University of the Cumberlands) in Williamsburg, Kentucky, in 1992 and began pastoring his first church a year later. He later continued his studies at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, earning two graduate degrees. He joined the seminary's faculty in 2002 and was also chosen as a trustee of the Southern Baptist Convention's International Mission Board that year. He was chairman of the board from 2008 until his departure in 2010. In 2005, Chitwood was elected to a one-year term as president of the Kentucky Baptist Convention (KBC). He was seen as the more theologically conservative of the two candidates for the office. At the expiration of his term, he continued his work as pastor of First Baptist Church in Mount Washington, Kentucky, and with the International Mission Board. In 2011, he was chosen as executive director of the KBC. He oversaw a reorganization of the convention that was credited with reversing a decade-long slide in baptisms and membership. He was an advocate for Sunrise Children's Services, a foster care and adoption agency operated by the KBC. Under Chitwood, Sunrise tripled the number of children it served, and Chitwood and his wife became foster parents for a young girl in Sunrise's care, eventually adopting her. On November 15, 2018, Chitwood accepted the position of President of the International Mission Board (IMB). He was immediately confronted with a report of past unreported or mishandled sexual abuse cases within the IMB, and promised to implement the recommendations of an independent law firm charged with investigating the reports. Throughout his ministry, Chitwood has opposed the employment of homosexual people by Baptist churches and organizations, expansion of gambling in Kentucky, and the expansion of sales of alcoholic beverages. Early life and ministry Paul Chitwood was born in LaFollette, Tennessee in 1970, one of three sons of Thomas Chitwood. His parents divorced when he was two years old, and his father, who maintained custody of Chitwood and his brothers, moved to Jellico, Tennessee. After being invited by the deacons of First Baptist Church in Jellico, the family become regular attenders. Chitwood's father, younger brother Dana, and Chitwood himself became professing Christians and were baptized into the church. Despite a fear of public speaking, Chitwood became a minister and preached his first sermon on a Wednesday night at his home church after the pastor had resigned. A car accident he was involved in as a teenager strengthened his resolve to pursue ministry. In 1992, Chitwood earned a Bachelor of Science degree in religion with a minor in biblical language at Cumberland College (now the University of the Cumberlands) in Williamsburg, Kentucky. He later attended the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, where he earned the Master of Divinity in 1995 and a doctorate degree in 2001. Chitwood became pastor of South Fork Baptist Church in Owenton, Kentucky, in 1993. In 1995, he left South Fork and became pastor of First Baptist Church in Owenton, serving until 1999. That year, he became pastor of First Baptist Church in Somerset, Kentucky. In 2003, he left to pastor First Baptist Church in Mount Washington, Kentucky, a congregation of approximately 2,000 people. While pastoring in Mount Washington, he opposed a local option ordinance to allow the sale of alcoholic beverages on Sundays. Chitwood married his high school girlfriend, Michelle Elaine Herron, in 1993. The couple has two biological children: a son, Daniel, and a daughter, Anna. They have a daughter, Cai, who they adopted from an orphanage in China, and a daughter, Lilly, who they adopted in 2018 after serving as her foster parents for three years through Sunrise Children's Services, a ministry of the Kentucky Baptist Convention. Work with the Southern Baptist Convention In 2002, Chitwood joined the faculty of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. That same year, he became a trustee of the International Mission Board, and he was chosen president of the Kentucky state pastors' conference. In 2008, he was chosen by his fellow trustees as chair of the IMB board of trustees. Chitwood left the IMB board of trustees in 2010. President of the Kentucky Baptist Convention Chitwood was elected to a one-year term as first vice- president of the Kentucky Baptist Convention in 2004. The following year, he was a candidate to succeed outgoing president Herschel York as president. The conservative York had been elected the previous year in a close vote of 686 to 627 over Rusty Ellison, who was seen as a moderate candidate. Chitwood was seen as the conservative candidate against another moderate, Robert DeFoor. DeFoor published a letter decrying the rise of fundamentalism within the KBC and saying that Chitwood was the choice of the fundamentalists; he later clarified that he did not know Chitwood personally very well, and was not accusing him of being a fundamentalist. Chitwood called DeFoor's comments \\"divisive\\". Chitwood won the election by a vote of 974 to 601. During Chitwood's term as president, the University of the Cumberlands - a KBC- affiliated university and Chitwood's alma mater - was criticized for expelling a student who posted on MySpace that he was homosexual, in violation of the school's code of conduct, which stated: \\"any student who engages in or promotes sexual behavior not consistent with Christian principles (including sex outside marriage and homosexuality) may be suspended or asked to withdraw.\\" Critics asked then-Governor Ernie Fletcher to use his line-item veto power to remove an $11 million state budget allocation for a new pharmacy school at the University of the Cumberlands because of the expulsion, but Fletcher, an ordained Baptist minister, declined. Chitwood supported the expulsion and Fletcher's decision not to veto the allocated funding. Executive Director of the Kentucky Baptist Convention In 2010, then- president of the Kentucky Baptist Convention Don Mathis asked Chitwood to consider becoming a candidate for executive director of the KBC, replacing retiring executive director Bill Mackey. Chitwood declined, but agreed to serve on the 15-member search committee. After the committee reached an impasse in the search process, the committee chair asked Chitwood to reconsider. Chitwood agreed and resigned from the search committee. On May 12, the committee recommended Chitwood for the position, and on June 2, he was elected by a vote of 88-7. He officially took office July 1, 2011. In May 2012, Chitwood announced a major reorganization of the KBC, focusing more resources on starting new churches, strengthening existing churches, and reaching individuals who did not attend church. In 2015, KBC churches reported an increase in church membership and number of baptisms, reversing a decade- long trend of decline. In 2016, the KBC announced that member churches had contributed $22.3 million to the Southern Baptist Convention through the Cooperative Program, more than any other year in the organization's history. During his time as executive director, Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear proposed legalizing casino gambling in the state as a means of raising revenue for the state treasury. Chitwood opposed this effort, recording an ad broadcast on Christian radio stations and distributing a video to Southern Baptist churches in Kentucky urging them to resist the governor's proposal. In 2014, controversy arose in the Kentucky Baptist Convention when Bill Smithwick, CEO of the KBC-operated Sunrise Children's Services, proposed dropping the restriction on the employment of homosexual people by Sunrise. Although Sunrise's board ultimately rejected the proposal and Smithwick resigned as CEO, many Southern Baptist churches in the state withheld their usual donations to the ministry out of fear that the proposal would succeed. Following Smithwick's resignation, Chitwood announced a fundraising campaign intended to raise $5 million to make up for the shortfall produced by the withheld offerings. Chitwood and his wife, Michelle, led a campaign called \\"Be the One\\", urging Kentucky Baptists to become more involved in helping care for abused and neglected children. During his tenure as KBC executive director, Sunrise Children's Services expanded to serve 1,300 children, triple the number served at the beginning of his tenure. In 2015, Chitwood was the chairman of the Southern Baptist Convention's Committee on Nominations. During Chitwood's term, Campbellsville University severed its covenant agreements with the KBC in order to gain more autonomy over its affairs. In 2017, Chitwood decried the Campbellsville's decision, along with a similar previous decision by Georgetown College: \\"Making off with untold millions of mission dollars invested in the institutions over the generations, these schools have not only broken their promises, they have betrayed their mission.\\" In 2018, Chitwood's alma mater, the University of the Cumberlands, also asked to dissolve its covenant agreement with the KBC. In 2017, Chitwood opined that the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, an organization to which some Southern Baptist churches also belong, would be taking a step in the wrong direction if it were to soften its stance on hiring LGBT people. The KBC formed a committee to monitor the CBF's policies at its meeting in November 2017, and CBF lifted its ban on employing homosexual people in February 2018. At the KBC annual meeting in November 2018, the convention expelled \\"more than a dozen\\" churches who continued to support CBF after the ban was lifted. In a subsequent interview, Chitwood said \\"the convention could not support groups that 'embrace alternative lifestyles' and adopt policies that 'redefine what is right and wrong' when it comes to Baptist beliefs that homosexuality is a sin.\\" President of the International Mission Board On November 6, 2018, he announced his candidacy for president of the International Mission Board, a position vacated by the resignation of David Platt in September 2018. He was endorsed by Al Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary; Kevin Ezell, president of the North American Mission Board; and Sandra Wisdom- Martin, executive director of the Woman's Missionary Union. On November 15, he was elected by a unanimous vote of the IMB's board of trustees and took office immediately. At the 2019 meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention, a report was presented by the law firm of Gray Plant Mooty regarding allegations of sexual abuse within the Southern Baptist Convention generally and the IMB generally. The report, commissioned in 2018 before Chitwood's election as IMB president, found \\"a number of significant concerns with IMB's handling of past cases\\" and contained several recommendations for policy changes aimed at preventing a recurrence of such incidents. On the day the report was released, Chitwood published a statement on the IMB web site apologizing for the past incidents and promising to adopt the policy recommendations contained in the report.

Hersent-Penquer, sometimes known as L√©ocadie Sala√ºn-Penquer or Mme Auguste Sala√ºn-Penquer, was born on 14 February 1817 into an established Breton family living at Ch√¢teau de Kerouartz near Lannilis in northwest France, where today a street is named after her. Her father was the doctor Jacques Hersent and her maternal grandfather was said to be General Marc-Antoine Coban (1763-1813), who died before she was born.  Early years  In 1842, she married the second-lieutenant Victor Burle but seven years later, in 1849, she became a widow at the age of 32. She married again on 15 September 1851, this time to the doctor Auguste Sala√ºn- Penquer (1809-1882) and became known as L√©ocadie Hersent-Penquer. They settled in his hometown of Brest and had two children, Yves and Marie, but only their daughter lived to adulthood. She died in 1933.  Literary life  On many occasions, especially during winter months, Hersent-Penquer visited many Parisian literary salons. There she met, among others, the writers Jos√©-Maria de Heredia, Victor Hugo, Alphonse de Lamartine and Charles Leconte de Lisle, all of whom would have a significant influence on her literary work. Hugo actively supported and encouraged her writing efforts. Leconte de Lisle introduced her to the other poets belonging to the Parnassians movement, and soon she and her husband became part of vibrant literary circles in Paris. Of her first novel, Chants du Foyer, one reviewer, Alphose S√©ch√©, said, \\"One finds there, expressed with feeling and harmony, the thoughts of the girl, the young woman and the young mother. Beside a great spiritualistic faith, there is, in this book, a profound feeling of nature\\" According to S√©ch√©, her second novel, Poetic Revelations, was directly influenced by Victor Hugo. Although S√©ch√© found its tone to be more serious, he said it contained more emphasis on ideas, and less on feelings. When comparing it to her first book, he concluded: \\"the language is more flexible and more visual and the inspiration harmonious and brilliant.\\" Back in her hometown of Brest, she followed the traditions she learned in the Paris salons, organizing literary soirees at her home. There she also read from her latest works, as she had in Paris. Together with her husband Auguste (who served as mayor of Brest from 1871 to 1881), they founded an art museum (Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts of Brest) in 1875 and arranged funding for it from the municipality. She and her second husband were both named honorary members of the Brest Academic Society, which declared Hersent-Penquer the \\"Muse of Brest.\\"  Later years  Bartholdi. After her husband Auguste died of pneumonia in 1882, Hersent-Penquer gave a commission to the prolific sculptor Fr√©d√©ric-Auguste Bartholdi (famous for his Statue of Liberty in New York) for a monument dedicated to her husband and where she could be interred as well. The completed granite tomb was erected in St. Martin Cemetery in Brest. Following her husband's death, she retired from social life and devoted her time to her children and grandchildren. Hersent- Penquer died seven weeks before her 72nd birthday on 19 December 1889 in Brest. Her eulogy was given by the president of the Brest Academic Society, who lauded her many literary accomplishments and wide influence and caller her \\"a poet in the most noble sense of the word.\\"  Selected works  Hersent- Penquer's first poem, one about loneliness, was written at the age of 16. Many of her poems and plays were published under the names L√©ocadie Hersent-Penquer or L√©ocadie Sala√ºn-Penquer although some work, such as her epic poem (370 pages in length) V√©ll√©da (\\"which glorifies Brittany and the Christian idea\\") and Le Paradis retrouv√©, and others, list the author as ‚ÄúMme Auguste Penquer.‚Äù  Narratives and poems  *Les chants du foyer. 1862 *Les r√©v√©lations po√©tiques. 1864 *√Ä propos des arbres du Luxembourg. 1866 *V√©ll√©da. 1868 *Le Paradis retrouv√©. 1869 *La payse. 1888 *Mes nuits. 1891 (published posthumously)  Plays  *Marcelline. 1870 *Syndoryx.

He was Bishop of Cabinda from 2005 to 2014, where his lack of identification with the province and its separatist movement initially made his appointment controversial and he was only installed after sixteen months. Family background Vieira Dias belongs to an illustrious Angolan family with strong links to the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). He is the cousin once removed of General H√©lder Vieira Dias, known as ‚ÄúKopelipa,‚Äù a member of the inner circle of former Angolese President Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos. He is also the great-nephew of the musician and political activist Carlos Aniceto Vieira Dias, known as \\"Liceu\\", who was a founder of the band Ngola Ritmos as well as of the MPLA, and the cousin once removed of musician Ruy Alberto Vieira Dias Mingas, who wrote the music for \\"Angola Avante\\", Angola's national anthem. Formation and early career Vieira Dias studied in the Capuchin minor seminary in Luanda and in the major seminary of Cristo Rei in Huambo. He earned a licentiate in theology at the Pontifical Urban University, a doctorate in theology from the Pontifical Lateran University and a licenciate in philosophy from the Pontifical Gregorian University. He studied journalism in Luanda and at the Catholic University of Paris. He also has a diploma in juridical- administrative practices from the Congregation for the Clergy in Rome. He was ordained a priest on 30 October 1983. Following his ordination, Dias worked as a parish vicar and as pastor to various local religious communities; rector of the minor and major seminaries of Luanda; vice-rector of the Catholic University of Angola; a lecturer in philosophy, fundamental theology, African history, African philosophy, contemporary philosophy, and theological ethics. He served on several diocesan committees and was a member of the Jacques Maritain International Association for development studies. He served on the Supervisory Board of the Association of Portuguese Language Universities and was a member of the Boston-based Angola Educational Assistance Fund and of the Scientific Society of the Catholic University of Portugal. Pope John Paul II appointed Vieira Dias titular bishop of Fiumepiscense and auxiliary bishop of Luanda on 25 October 2003 and he was consecrated a bishop on 11 January 2004. Bishop of Cabinda On 11 February 2005, Vieira Dias was appointed Bishop of Cabinda by John Paul II. His personal ties to Cabinda were limited to a period as a parish minister early in his career. Because he was not from Cabinda and because of his family links to the regime of Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos, Vieira Dias‚Äôs appointment was controversial and was met with massive protests by Cabindan Catholics. His predecessor, Paulino Fernandes Madeca, was known to be sympathetic to the Cabindan separatist cause. The Episcopal Conference of Angola and S√£o Tom√© (CEAST) decried the opposition of Cabindan Catholics to Vieira Dias's nomination and warned against the politicization of the Church in Cabinda. In Vieira Dias's absence, Eugenio Dal Corso, then the bishop of Saur√≠mo, was sent to Cabinda in July to become apostolic administrator of the diocese. On 18 July, he was beaten while preparing to celebrate mass at the church of the Immaculate Conception and had to be taken to the hospital. Dal Corso responded by shutting the parish and suspending its pastor, Fr. Jorge Casimiro Congo. After local priests, including Cabinda's vicar general Fr. Raul Tati, protested against this move by writing to the Vatican with a request for Dal Corso's resignation, Dal Corso dismissed Tati from his position. Many Cabindan clergy went on strike in solidarity with the suspended priests and refused to celebrate mass. While CEAST stated that it held the priests ‚Äúcompletely‚Äù responsible for not celebrating mass, Fr. Congo responded that no dialogue had been held with the Cabindan clergy and people. Meanwhile, the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda stated that it held CEAST responsible for the confrontation and implied that the bishops' conference was being manipulated by the Angolan government. Papal nuncio Giovanni Angelo Becciu emphasized that Vieira Dias's nomination was a matter of papal prerogative and would not be revoked. He came to Cabinda in order to meet with Dal Corso, and while he held a ‚Äúfraternal‚Äù meeting with Cabindan priests, his meeting with laypeople was \\"hostile\\" and his car was stoned by a crowd. At the beginning of December 2005, an accord for the resumption of the celebration of masses was reached. By the end of March 2006, CEAST declared that the religious life of the Cabinda diocese was back to normal. Vieira Dias's installation took place on 10 June 2006. While bishop of Cabinda, Vieira Dias served as coordinator for Benedict XVI's 2009 visit to Angola. Pope Francis named him a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture on 29 March 2014. Archbishop of Luanda On 8 December 2014, Pope Francis appointed Vieira Dias archbishop of Luanda. Local observers disputed the significance of his personal ties to the government. He was installed on 24 January 2015. On 9 November 2015, he was elected president of CEAST. He continued as Apostolic Administrator of Cabinda from the time of his assignment to Luanda until the installation of his successor in Cabinda, Belmiro Cuica Chissengueti, on 7 October 2018. The Angola government was reportedly upset that in October 2019 Pope Francis did not make the Angola native Vieira Dias a cardinal, choosing instead the Italian-born Eugenio dal Corso, bishop emeritus of the Angolan dioceses of Saur√≠mo and Benguela.

Vilhelmines Lyst is seen in the bottom right corner Meinungsgade takes its name from captain Conrad Robertus Meinung (1805-1873) who owned a country house named Vilhelmines Lyst at the site. In circa 1859, he constructed the road and started to sell the land off in lots. As something new, Meinung constructed workers' housing with cavity walls. The method received an award on the Exposition Universelle in Paris. The institution for intellectually disabled deaf mutes Rudolph Koefod var had already constructed a factory at the site in 1857. H. Rudolph Koefoed & Co. was later merged with another machine factory under the name Koefod & Hauberg. Another industrial enterprise, Smith & Mtgind, later FLSmidth, was founded in 1872 founded in a former stable between Meinungsgade and M√∏llegade. It was after a few months replaced by a machine factory. Koefod & Hauberg relocated to Tagensvej after being merged with Marstrand, Helweg & Co. under the name Titan A/S in 1897.

Five people were killed at the store, including the two assailants and three civilians whom they attacked. Additionally, the assailants wounded one civilian and two police officers. A Jersey City Police Department detective was shot and killed by the assailants at a nearby cemetery just before the grocery store attack. New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal stated that evidence indicated the attacks were acts of hate and domestic terrorism fueled both by anti-Semitism and anti-law enforcement beliefs.  Shootings  On December 10, 2019, a police detective, who was meeting an informant, came across the assailants at the Bayview Cemetery in Jersey City, New Jersey in what was described as a chance encounter. It is believed that he approached the suspects, who were in a stolen U-Haul van that was linked to a murder the previous weekend of 34-year-old Jersey City resident Michael Rumberger in nearby Bayonne, New Jersey. The assailants shot and killed the officer. His body was discovered by a bystander and reported at 12:38 p.m. The suspects then fled in the stolen van and drove about one mile to a kosher grocery store, the JC Kosher Supermarket in the Greenville section of Jersey City, and opened fire upon exiting the vehicle. At approximately 12:21 p.m., while wearing tactical gear they entered the store and fatally shot an owner, a worker, and a customer. Two other customers were able to escape. In the ensuing shootout, the assailants exchanged gunfire with the police for over an hour until they were shot and killed. A BearCat armored personnel carrier rammed through the storefront, ending the siege. The van was later found to contain a live pipe bomb that had the capacity to kill or injure people up to 500 yards away. Multiple law enforcement agencies responded to the scene: the Jersey City Police Department; the Hudson County Sheriff's Office; the New Jersey State Police; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department; the New York City Police Department and departments from other neighboring municipalities; and sheriffs from three counties Misaskim worked with authorities to provide emergency services for the care of the dead Orthodox Jewish victims.  Victims  Detective Joseph Seals was 39 years old and had been a police officer since 2006. Three civilians were also killed: 33-year-old female store owner Mindy Ferencz, 49-year-old male employee Douglas Miguel Rodriguez, and 24-year-old male rabbinical student customer Moshe Deutsch. Two officers, one male and one female, were wounded in the shootout and were released from the hospital the same day. A wounded man escaped out the back door of the store. He was treated at Jersey City Medical Center, and released on the same day.  Assailants  On December 11, the shooters, both of whom were killed by police during the siege, were identified as David Nathaniel Anderson (age 47) and his girlfriend Francine Graham (age 50). Both were African-American. Anderson and Graham were suspects in the murder of Uber driver Michael Rumberger in Bayonne the weekend prior to the attack. Rumberger's blood was found on a bible that belonged to the assailants, and his DNA was on their clothes and one weapon. Anderson and Graham had Googled the meaning of the surname \\"Rumberger\\". Anderson and Graham were also suspects in an incident a week before the Jersey City shooting, when on December 3 two shots were fired at a vehicle driven by a person clearly identifiable as being Jewish, on U.S. Route 1/9 near Newark and Elizabeth, New Jersey. The vehicle's rear window was shot out. Graham‚Äôs phone was in the area at the time of the shooting, and the ballistics matched a gun linked to the two assailants, it was later determined. Anderson had made posts on social media that were anti-police and anti-Semitic. His language was linked to that used by the Black Hebrew Israelite movement, which has no connection to mainstream Judaism, the extremist fringe of which includes numerous hate groups listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Anderson and Graham bought a number of weapons, and trained to use them in Ohio. Before they engaged in the Jersey City attack, they researched another possible attack on a Jewish community center in Bayonne.  Motive  Mayor of Jersey City Steven Fulop, referring to the market, tweeted that the shooters \\"targeted the location they attacked\\". He later referred to the attack as a hate crime. Mayor of New York Bill de Blasio called the attack a ‚Äúpremeditated violent antisemitic hate crime‚Äù and an ‚Äúact of terror.‚Äù New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal stated that evidence indicated acts of hate and domestic terrorism fuelled both by anti-Semitism and anti-law enforcement beliefs. Media reported that a handwritten note, which authorities call \\"manifesto-style', found inside the van said ‚ÄúI do this because my creator makes me do this and I hate who he hates.‚Äù  Aftermath  The Jersey City Medical Center, 12 Jersey City Public Schools in the vicinity as well as that of Sacred Heart Church, located across the street, were on lock-down during the incident. That school was taken over by law-enforcement agencies and used during the incident. Between 50-60 children were held in the yeshiva of Khal Adas Greenville next to the market. Public transportation on NJ Transit buses and the Hudson Bergen Light Rail in the area were suspended. The New Jersey Turnpike Newark Bay Extension was temporarily closed. President Donald Trump was briefed about the incident at the White House. He gave his condolences to the victims and their families via a tweet. Governor of New Jersey Phil Murphy expressed his condolences, his thoughts and prayers for police, residents, and school children, and praise for the slain detective in a series of tweets. Cory Booker, junior United States Senator from New Jersey, and Mayor Fulop also expressed their condolences. On December 12, 2019, US Representative Rashida Tlaib released a tweet on her personal account blaming the attack on white supremacy, which was later deleted. Mayor Fulop said a trustee of the Jersey City Board of Education, Joan Terrell-Paige, should resign due to a Facebook message she posted after the shooting, in which she said black residents were \\"threatened, intimidated and harassed\\" by \\"brutes of the jewish community\\" (sic). She made reference to accusations of rabbis selling body parts. Terrell-Paige, who is African American, further asked whether the public is \\"brave enough\\" to listen to the perpetrators' message. Governor Murphy concurred in asking Terrell- Paige to resign; she said she is unrepentant. The Anti-Defamation League asked Terrell-Paige to resign citing her \\"lack of remorse\\". Her Facebook post is characterized by some as being antisemitic although one person called Terrell- Paige the \\"Rosa Parks of this era\\". Fulop said that analysis of the assailants' computers showed that they likely intended to do more harm, that the yeshiva was the probable target of the attack, and that they \\"moved more quickly\\" with their plans because of their encounter with Detective Seals. In January 2020 Jared Maples, director of the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, said it was investigating possible funding sources for the attack, but with many lone wolf attacks they \\"do not need large amounts of funding to conduct their operations, making it difficult to detect and prevent attacks. The most common tactics in domestic extremist attacks include easily obtainable weapons, such as knives, small arms, and vehicles.\\" The market was re-opened by its owner at a nearby location in March 2020.

It was released in 2011 for iOS devices, on March 17, 2012 for Android devices, and on September 4, 2013 for Microsoft Windows and Windows Phone.  Gameplay  Six-Guns is a wild-west styled open-world, action adventure mobile game. The player may roam about on foot or by horse and complete missions as a man named Buck Crosshaw across two game maps, Arizona (with deserts and mesas) and Oregon (containing forests and mountains). An in-game store and currency system allow for upgradable clothing items, weapons, and horses, with optional microtransactions available for additional or premium credits. As missions are completed, the player is rewarded with coins and experience points, unlocking access to higher tier items from the store. The main storyline and campaign follows Crosshaw's discoveries of the happenings and fate of his lost wife, while a multiplayer mode allows for online team deathmatches and capture-the- flag. The Windows 8 version had support for touch controls, keyboard and mouse, and a gaming controller. The game could also cloud save to a linked account, such as Game Center on iOS or Xbox Live on Windows 8. Plot You play as Buck Crosshaw, a cowboy who has been considered an outlaw and therefore he faked his own death. He seemingly had killed his own wife due to suspecting her being a witch (he's being proven right later in the storyline). As Buck you have to fight outlaws, witches, vampires, zombies and participate in horse races and shooting at jama-jamas. There is also a sidequest storyline, and particular quests either in one state only or in both: the quests take place in Arizona and Oregon as well as multiplayer locations.  Reception  Six-Guns received mixed reviews. Many critics praised the graphics and audio of the game, but felt that the controls were poor on touchscreen devices.

It is a memoir where Gottlieb portrays a difficult time in her professional and personal life. The dual nature of the book enables Gottlieb to show her world as both a therapist and someone receiving therapy. Gottlieb explores five patients, including herself, and their different scenarios and viewpoints on life.  Synopsis  Lori Gottlieb, psychotherapist, was in a long time relationship when suddenly it all came crashing down. Her boyfriend decides to break up with her because he can not live with a kid. This was a surprise to Gottlieb as the couple were deciding to get married and her boyfriend knew she had a child. During this time in her life, Gottlieb depicts common human emotions and struggles as anyone who is encountering hardships. Despite being an expert and trained therapist herself, Gottlieb was encouraged by her friends to see a therapist due to her negative state of mind. She realizes that her grief can be addressed with a therapist and so she begins to see one named Wendell. In her first few sessions, Lori sits with her grief and cries. Once she has moved on from this stage, Wendell states that he thinks she is suffering with something more complicated than losing a boyfriend. This takes Gottlieb by surprise and confusion as she only came for a couple of sessions. As the sessions continue, Lori takes us back to the beginning of her career. Lori is a writer in Los Angeles and works on a medical drama which sparked her interest in medical school. In order to fulfill her desire to help others and continue story telling, she decides to become a therapist. As the book progresses, Gottlieb talks about her four patients. John is a successful producer who is around the age of forty. He has two kids and is married. He believes that everyone around him is an idiot and that they are the problem. He doesn't sleep a lot and is also having issues with his wife. At the beginning of the sessions, he is not likable and insults his therapist. Gottlieb tries to find a way to connect and see the underlying issue. She later finds out that he lost his son and experienced trauma that impacts his behavior and emotions. A young woman named Julie is a newly wed and goes on her honeymoon. When she returns, she thinks she is pregnant as she feels something in her breast. But this was cancer which she was able to treat. Six months later, Julie goes to her sign off scan hoping that all is well and she can get pregnant now. However, she developed a rare form of cancer that is untreatable. The book shows how Julie struggles with her situation and with society's thoughts. Rita is a woman who is turning seventy and is very depressed. At a young age, Rita dropped out of college and married someone. After a couple of years, the husband had a drinking problem and became abusive to the children. Rita made significant mistakes as a parent and her adult children would not talk to her. She was not able to obtain her career of choice, had failed marriages, and was alone and isolated. Rita explains that joy is unanticipated pain and not pleasure for her. She seeks forgiveness from her children. She also tells Gottlieb that she does not want to live anymore if life doesn't get better. Charlotte is a woman in her twenties and is successful with her job. She drinks too much and ends up with the wrong man every time she hooks up, including someone in the waiting room. She gave up the hope of having a good childhood to have a better adulthood.  Characters  * Lori Gottlieb is a therapist and a patient * John is a self absorbed Hollywood producer * Julie is a newlywed around the age of thirty, diagnosed with a terminal illness * Rita is a senior citizen who wants to end her life on her birthday * Charlotte is a twenty-year-old woman struggling with damaging relationships and alcoholism * Wendell is Lori Gottlieb's psychotherapist  Reception  The book was on The New York Times best- seller list for Hardcover Nonfiction. A review in The New York Times praised the book's effective storytelling, which turns its anecdotes into \\"a kind of ensemble soap opera.\\" The reviewer also said of the writing style that \\"Gottlieb can be judgmental and obsessive, but she‚Äôs authentic, even raw, about herself and her patients.\\" It received a starred review in Kirkus, and was also reviewed by Publishers Weekly, USA Today, Time, New Statesman, and Slate.  Adaptation  ABC Studios is developing a television series based on the book with Eva Longoria.

Iraq provided $1663.89 million SDR, Special Drawing Rights, to the IMF, which is 0.35% of total SDR paid to the IMF. It also has 18,103 votes, which is 0.36% of the total votes distributed to the member countries of the IMF. The current Board of Governor of Iraq is Ali Muhsin Ismail with an alternative Board of Governor, Khaled Salah Alddin Mohammed Murad. Iraq is the part of the constituency with other countries such as Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Maldives, Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Republic of Yemen. This constituency has 127,164 votes, 2.53% of total votes in the IMF. Since first joined, Iraq faced 4 official arrangements from the IMF: first arrangement on December 23, 2005 and the latest arrangement on July 7, 2016.  History  As one of the original members of IMF, Iraq joined the IMF on December 27, 1945. According to Article II, Section I of the IMF agreements, the original members of the IMF are those countries that contributed at ‚Äúthe United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference‚Äù that was held in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, from July 1 to 22nd. The chairman of Iraq at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference was Ibrahim Kamal. Map of Iraq  Arrangements  There was a total of 4 arrangements Iraq faced from the IMF.  First arrangement  First Arrangement was on December 23, 2005. It was for 15 months cycle originally, with the expiration date of March 2007. However, the Iraqi government requested to extend the expiration date, and the first arrangement actually expired on December 18, 2007. The IMF and Iraq agreed with the amount of $475,360 SDR, which is 40% of the total quota of the Iraqi government. However, Iraq has drawn $0 from that arrangement amount agreed with the IMF. The reason why Iraq faced the arrangement from the IMF was to gain an economic background for the Iraq government's new economic development program for next year, 2006. Iraq's economic program for 2006 comprises putting emphasis on administrations, distributing resources correctly regarding the issues of oil products, and accelerating prices of oil products. The IMF and the Iraqi government decided to improve economic growth to 10% and to reduce the inflation rate to 15%.  Latest arrangement  The latest arrangement was on July 7, 2016 with a 3-year cycle. Its expiration date was July 6, 2019 with the agreed amount of 3,831,000 SDR. Iraq government has drawn 1,494,200 SDR from the agreed amount and has an outstanding amount of 1,437,325 SDR. The Iraqi government tried to settle the economy which as affected by the global decline of oil prices and the ISIS crisis. Most of those arrangements were to stabilize exchange rates and remove restrictions on exchange rates. In addition, to hinder money laundering, terrorism, and illegal economic actions. The latest arrangement faced multiple problems including military actions against ISIS and aids regarding the confliction with ISIS.

He was the brother of a Pietist writer and mystic Eva Margareta Fr√∂lich (1650-1692) and a colonel Hans Frederik Fr√∂lich (1637-1715).  Biography  Born in 1637 in the family of the Swedish Army officer colonel Hans Christoffer Fr√∂lich (1602-1658)Hans Christoffer Fr√∂lich and his wife Elizabeth, born in von Plessen. Fr√∂lich became Lieutenant-Major of the Swedish Army and Commander in Bohus Fortress in 1676. In 1678 he became Lieutenant-Colonel. In the summer of 1678 Bohus fortress was besieged by Ulrik Frederik Gyldenl√∏ve and an army of 7,000 German and 9,000 Norwegian soldiers. Bohus Fortress had a Swedish crew of 900 men, led by Colonel Friedrich B√∂rstell and Lieutenant Colonel Carl Gustav Fr√∂lich. The fortress was fired for two months with quantities of cannonballs, bombs, rock bumps, glowing bullets, grenades and mines. The attackers also used catapult to throw in bags with latrine for the purpose of spreading disease. The Swedish crew, however, managed the siege, but more than half the crew did. After the siege, Fr√∂lich became colonel and commander in Marstrand. He became a naturalized Swedish nobleman. In 1693 he became Major- General at V√§sternorrland County, J√§mtland and H√§rjedalen.

From April 18, 1702, he also served as Governor-General of Vidzeme, Sweden, and during the invasion of Russian troops in 1704, he was promoted to infantry general and commander of the Riga garrison. On January 17, 1706 he was dismissed as Governor General before the siege of Riga (1709-1710) due to an unsuccessful attempt of monetary reform. He left Vidzeme and returned to Sweden, where he died in 1714.

Kousri is a co-founder of the #EnaZeda (Tunisian #MeToo) movement and a co-ordinator of the Tunisian Association of Democratic Women. She is a campaigner for LGBT rights and her photographic project documenting the lives of same-sex couples went viral in 2017.  Biography  Kousri has a Tunisian degree which licences her to practice law and she studied for a masters in Sweden, with a dissertation that focused on digital technology and social change. She says her political activism is a product of her family's struggles against former the authoritarian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. Kousri began activism against sexual harassment in Tunisian society while a law student, reporting cases to the police despite their dismissive attitude.Anna Antonakis, Renegotiating Gender and the State in Tunisia between 2011 and 2014: Power, Positionality, and the Public Sphere, Politik Und Gesellschaft Des Nahen Ostens (Wiesbaden: Springer, 2019), p. 200 . Her political journalism has commented on a variety of subjects including: support for presidential candidate Hamma Hammami, the arrest of blogger , the assassination of Shaimaa al-Sabbagh who was leader of the Popular Socialist Alliance in Egypt, democracy in Tunisia, on human rights activist , on unionist Houcine Abassi, as well as other topics. Kousri has also spoken out against sexual violence against Yezidi women by members of Islamic State. She has added a voice of criticism to the work of Tunisian politician Monia Ibrahim who opposed a law that would expand women's rights in the country. As a law student, Kousri spoke out against the Islamist government and how Tunisia's politics needed to move to the left.  #EnaZeda  In 2019, Kousri became one of the co-founders of the Tunisian #MeToo movement. Called #EnaZeda () in Tunisia, Kousri said that it \\"is simply the culmination of a struggle that has been going on for years\\". As of November 2019, the movement's Facebook group had over 21,600 members; it is a place where protest is organised and also provides a safe space for testimony from survivors. Kousri described the success of the movement as owing a debt to the way that women in Egypt had spoken out for their own civil rights. She also credits the power of #EnaZeda in gathering momentum quickly - previous campaigns about harassment on public transport by feminist organisations did not capture the imagination of women in Tunisia in the same way. Kousri has discussed how she observed that after the uprisings of December 2010, sexual violence against women increased and became more violent. The movement reveals the scale of the problem and shows that silencing victims does not solve problems of sexual aggression in societies.  Tunisian Association of Democratic Women  Kousri is a co-coordinator with the Association Tunisienne des Femmes D√©mocrates (Tunisian Association of Democratic Women, ATFD), a feminist campaign organisation.Anna Antonakis, Renegotiating Gender and the State in Tunisia between 2011 and 2014: Power, Positionality, and the Public Sphere, Politik Und Gesellschaft Des Nahen Ostens (Wiesbaden: Springer, 2019), p. 210; . Within the ATFD, Kousri's portfolio is on the Commission on Sexual & Reproductive Rights. She was a joint signatory with the Coalition for Sexual and Bodily Rights in Muslim Societies (CSBR) in an open letter to Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan condemning the murder and torture of Hande Kader. In 2017, she spoke out on behalf of the organisation against the law that bans marriage between Muslim women and non-Muslims in Tunisia. In 2019, she led a campaign encouraging the state to re-engage with women's reproductive health as a concern - with cuts in funding, women's access to contraception had declined.  LGBTQI* Rights  Kousri is an active advocate for LGBT rights in Tunisia, where homosexuality is illegal. In 2014 she spoke out against the increase in violence against LGBT communities in Egypt. She condemned the actions of journalist Mona Iraqi, who published the identities of 26 men arrested at a Cairo hammam on charges of \\"indecency\\". In 2015 Kousri posted a series of images of same-sex couples on social media, which went viral. The project \\"Sexuality Is Not Taboo\\" was aimed at making visible LGBT communities from Tunisia.Haithem Haouel, \\"[https://fr.allafrica.com/stories/201510051044.html Shams pour la d√©p√©nalisation des droits des homosexuels organise son premier meeting public\\", La Presse (4 October 2015). She said of the project: > My photo project aims to use the internet to provoke people to reflect on > sexual rights. We carried out the revolution, and we refuse to go on being > harassed, punished, or pushed around for what we do in the bedroom. By > publishing photos of same-sex couples kissing in public spaces, I hope to > push forward the debate about gay rights in Tunisia that has been gaining > momentum since the start of the revolution. In the same year, she was arrested in what was reported by the Tunisian Le Temps as an unlawful arrest of a kind characteristic of police harassment of women.Salma Bouraoui, \\"Comment garantir la s√©curit√© sans tomber dans les abus ?\\", Le Temps (8 january 2015). Kousri was one of the speakers at the WorldPrideSummit in 2017 in Madrid. She led a discussion about LGBTQIA+ in Africa with Kasha Nabagesera from Uganda, South African Yahia Zaidi, Alimi Bisi Ademola from Nigeria and Mich√®le Ndoki from Cameroon. In 2017, Kousri was fired by the fundraising department of SOS Children's Villages, as a direct result of her activism. The reason given for the dismissal was that Kousri's work on countering discrimination to LGBT communities could also \\"be damaging\\" to children.

It is reputed to have been the site for impromptu-parliaments held by kings John and Edward I. In the 19th century the tree was propped-up by William Bentinck, 4th Duke of Portland. In recent years the Parliament Oak was threatened by fly-tipping and competing vegetation but was subject to conservation work in 2008. The tree was shortlisted for the 2017 Woodland Trust Tree of the Year award.  History  The tree stood around from King John's Palace at Clipstone. King John stayed at the palace from around the time of his 1199 accession for hunting in Clipstone Park, part of Sherwood Forest. Clipstone was one of the oldest parks in England, being enclosed for hunting since before the 1066 Norman Conquest. The Parliament Oak is thought to date from around this time, being of comparable age to the Major Oak, which has been estimated to be 800‚Äì1000 years old. It is said that John hastily assembled a parliament at the tree in 1212 upon being informed, whilst hunting, that revolts against his rule had broken out in Wales and Northern England. He is thought to have decreed that 28 Welsh boys held as hostages at Nottingham Castle were to be put to death as a consequence. Other English kings of this time, including Edward I, also stayed at Clipstone for the hunting. Edward is also said to have assembled a parliament at the tree on Michaelmas (29 September) 1290, whilst travelling to Scotland. It is thought this story is more likely to be true than the legend of John's parliament; it was not uncommon for parliaments to be held outdoors in this period, particularly when discussing matters such as the royal forests. The tree was drawn in 1790, at which point it measured in circumference at a height of . By 1843 it stood on the Ollerton high road, at a point from Ollerton and on the fringe of what remained of Sherwood Forest. It measured in circumference at a height of from the ground and had a large hollow within it that could accommodate six men. The Parliament Oak was owned at this time by William Bentinck, 4th Duke of Portland who feared it was in danger of dying. He ordered a support framework erected to reinforce the tree against gales. He also planted an acorn within the hollow trunk to grow a replacement.  Recent developments  The tree stands at the edge of Clipstone Forest, in an access off the A6075 and is looked after by The Sherwood Forest Trust. Its proximity to the road has placed it at risk of damage and it has previously been threatened by fly-tipping and overgrowth of nearby vegetation. A fence constructed to protect the tree was destroyed and in 2007 The Independent newspaper described the situation as \\"one of the biggest failings of our heritage protection laws\\". A ¬£35,000 project led by The Sherwood Forest Trust and Nottinghamshire County Council was carried out in summer 2008 to restore the area, plant of new hedgerow, construct two car parking spaces and install an information plaque. The Parliament Oak has been described as relatively unknown when compared with the Major Oak but was shortlisted for the 2017 Woodland Trust Tree of the Year award. A pub named after the oak stood in Mansfield Woodhouse until 2011.

He is the chairman and CEO of Germany holding company Extra Holding, which controls Extra Energy. He is also the owner of Alon Blue Square, and briefly served as chairman of IDB Group. Personal life Ben- Moshe was born in Beersheba as Mordechai Moshiashvili, to Ya'akov and Atri, olim from Kulashi, Georgia. When he was a baby, the family moved to Lod. Moshiashvili went to Hameiri Elementary in the city, and subsequently to Nehalim Yeshiva next to Petah Tikva, where he studied under Rabbi Menachem Hirsch. His father is a bank manager for Bank Mizrahi-Tefahot in Ramla. He also has a sister named Tzipora Elisha. After graduating from the Yeshiva, Moshiashvili Hebraized his name to Ben-Moshe. He served in the Israel Defense Forces in non-combat roles, and took lessons in computer programming. He later enrolled in Bar Ilan University, but dropped out after two years to focus on business. Ben-Moshe lives in Modi'in. He is married to Maya Mudargashvili, and has four children. Business career In the late 1990s Ben-Moshe founded the billing software company Cyber Gate, where he was one of the software developers. It became successful due to its business model of charging customers based on the latter's revenue, instead of a fixed price. He then emigrated to Germany, where he joined Aldi and sold Internet services through the chain. He partnered with the German subsidiary of Spanish company Telef√≥nica, and went on to purchase Internet infrastructure. This business was done in the shadow of the dot-com bust, which left a lot of Internet infrastructure unused‚Äîwhich Ben-Moshe was able to buy at heavily reduced prices. Ben-Moshe returned to Israel in 2002. He continued to do business in Germany and Europe through Extra Holding, a holding company that manages his business on the continent. It deals mainly in telecommunication, insurance and energy. In 2008, Ben-Moshe created a fund to engage in renewable energy projects in Israel, together with Yashka Barnim. Barnim left the partnership in 2011. Ben-Moshe also owns a minimarket chain, Kolel Store, and other small and medium businesses in Israel. IDB Group purchase On December 17, 2013, Ben-Moshe and his partner Eduardo Elsztain took over IDB Group, a major Israeli holding company, from Nochi Dankner. Ben-Moshe placed an ILS 600 million guarantee for the deal to go through, and committed to investing over ILS 1 billion more in the company. Prior to the purchase, Ben-Moshe had been virtually unknown in the Israeli business community. At least two legal opinions pertaining to the court deliberations over the IDB sale said that they could not be sure that Ben-Moshe was indeed the sole owner of Extra Holding, casting doubt on his ability to enter as a partner in IDB. However, the court accepted Ben-Moshe's statement that he was the sole owner. According to Ben-Moshe, the expressed doubts were bits of deliberate misinformation coming from Nochi Dankner and his advisors. In May 2015, Elsztain injected additional cash into the ailing IDB, removing Ben-Moshe as co-chairman of the board. The two each wanted to take full control of the group, and following arbitration proceedings, Elsztain bought out Ben-Moshe's shares in the company. Ben-Moshe lost approximately ILS 500 million with IDB. Further business in Israel In 2016, Ben-Moshe purchased yet another holding company, Alon Blue Square, again as part of a debt settlement. In 2017 he decided to buy yet another troubled company, Africa Israel Investments, but after 18 months of negotiations he was beaten out by a partnership of real estate companies Mega Or and Big Shopping Centers.

Klemm, 589 U.S. ___ (2019), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States involving the statute of limitations under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act of 1977. The Court ruled that the statute of limitations begins one year after the alleged FDPCA violation took place, not one year after the violation was discovered by the plaintiff.. This ruling affirmed a decision by the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. It is noteworthy for being the first signed opinion released from the 2019 term. It is also noteworthy for resolving a circuit split regarding a major consumer protection law.  Background   Legal concepts  = The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act = In 1977, Congress enacted the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDPCA), a landmark consumer protection law which established federal legal protections against abusive or unfair debt collection practices. It enacted regulations on the way debt collectors could conduct business, including requirements for serving notice of collection lawsuits to debtors. The FDPCA is enforced by a variety of federal agencies, primarily the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FDPCA also establishes a private right of action; this allows private individuals who are harmed by unlawful debt collection practices to file lawsuits against the debt collector on their own. = Tolling = In law, tolling is a legal doctrine that allows for the delay or pausing of a statute of limitations. (That is, the statute of limitations can be 'tolled' (paused) for a period of time, granting one party additional time to file a lawsuit). Even if a statute doesn't explicitly contain a provision for tolling, courts can sometimes toll a statute of limitations under the principle of equity, generally when the plaintiff -- through no fault of their own -- was denied their ability to file suit in a timely manner.  Case history  The plaintiff, Rotkiske, accrued approximately $1,200 in credit card debt between 2003 and 2005. After he failed to pay the debt, his bank turned to a professional debt-collection firm called Klemm & Associates. Klemm first attempted to sue Rotkiske in Philadelphia Municipal Court in March 2008. However, it served the notification of the lawsuit to an old address, where a stranger at that address accepted the notification. When Klemm learned that they had the wrong address, they dropped the suit. In 2009, Klemm filed suit for the second time, sending the notification of the lawsuit the same address as in 2008 where, again, a stranger accepted the notification. When Rotkiske failed to appear, the Philadelphia Municipal Court entered a default judgment against him. In September 2014, Rotkiske discovered the default judgment on his record when he was denied a mortgage because of it. In June 2015, Rotkiske filed a federal lawsuit under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act in the federal court.  In lower courts  Rotkiske's federal lawsuit was first heard by the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Rotkiske argued that Klemm had violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act when it filed its second lawsuit against him in 2009, after the state-law statute of limitations had expired. He argued that Klemm should not have even attempted to contact him when it knew it did not have the legal ability to collect. Klemm responded by filing a motion to dismiss, arguing that the FDPCA provides a 1-year statute of limitations for private suits, which had long expired by 2015. Rotkiske acknowledged that he had filed his lawsuit extremely late. However, in his filing he argued that the doctrine of equitable tolling meant that the statute of limitations should not have begun until 2014 (when he discovered the default judgment while applying for his mortgage). He argued that the doctrine of equitable tolling applied to his case because Klemm committed fraud by deliberately sending the notification of the 2009 lawsuit to an address that they knew was incorrect, thus depriving him of the ability to appear in court. This practice, colloquially known as sewer service (in reference to the act of \\"serving\\" court papers to someone by dumping them in a sewer), is prohibited by law. He also argued in the alternative that the statute of limitations would not begin until he discovered the default judgment on his record. In March 2016 Eastern District court sided with Klemm, dismissing Rotkiske's lawsuit over the statute of limitations issue. The judge ruled that the statute of limitations continues to run even if the plaintiff did not know about the FDPCA violation. They also rejected his argument regarding equitable tolling, ruling that, even if Klemm had deliberately sent the notification to the wrong house, Rotkiske had not been misled by their conduct Rotkiske appealed to the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, which in a unanimous en banc ruling authored by Judge Thomas Hardiman, upheld the Eastern District court's ruling against him in May 2018. The precedent established by the 3rd Circuit contradicted rulings from the 4th Circuit and the 9th Circuit, each of which had previously held that the statute of limitations begins to toll from the date the violation was discovered, not when it occurred. Rotkiske appealed again, this time to the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court granted his application for a writ of certiorari, agreeing to hear the case, on February 25, 2019. Before the Supreme Court, Rotkiske was represented by Scott Gant of the prominent firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP. Shay Dvoretzky from Jones Day argued the case on behalf of Klemm.  Supreme Court opinion  On December 10, 2019, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the one-year filing deadline for FDCPA lawsuits runs from the date when the alleged violation occurs.  Majority opinion  In the 8‚Äì1 majority opinion, authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Court applied a textualist reading of the FDCPA and found that the plain language of the law was unambigous: an FDPCA action \\"may be brought [...] within one year from the date on which the violation occurs\\", with no mention of \\"discovery rule\\" extending the deadline to file to one year after the violation was discovered by the plaintiff. The majority opinion rejected Rotkiske's wish to incorporate a discovery rule into the FDPCA, describing such an expansive application of the discovery rule as a \\"bad wine of recent vintage\\". The opinion noted that Congress could have chosen to include a discovery rule in the law but deliberately chose not to, making it inappropriate for the Supreme Court to add that to the law. It also noted that, though Rotkiske had made an argument based on equitable tolling and fraud in the District Court, he chose not to raise that argument in his appeal, thus preventing the Supreme Court from addressing it.  Concurrence  In her concurrence, Justice Sonia Sotomayor agreed with the majority opinion's interpretation of the FDPCA and its ruling against Rotkiske. She wrote separately to challenge the majority's assertion that the discovery rule was a \\"bad wine of recent vintage\\", noting that the Supreme Court had long recognized this exception to the statutes of limitation for suits based on fraud or concealment, including Holmberg v. Armbrecht (1946), Exploration Co. v. United States (1918), and Bailey v. Glover (1875).  Dissent  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed an opinion dissenting in part and dissenting from the judgment. She agreed with the majority's interpretation of the FDPCA statute of limitations, but asserted that the fraudulent actions alleged in the complaint should warrant the application of the discovery rule, starting the statute of limitations on the date that he learned of the default judgment (in 2014). She considers this fraud-based discovery rule distinct from the generic discovery rule rejected by the majority, and would apply it even in cases where the generic discovery rule does not apply. Ginsburg's opinion also challenges the claim that Rotkiske failed to preserve the fraud argument in his appeals.  Effect  This ruling upheld the 3rd Circuit's ruling against Rotkiske, and resolved a circuit split between the 3rd Circuit and the 4th and 9th Circuit Courts of Appeal.

He is the author of a collection of poetry, Sacred Vows (1998), and a memoir, Crossing Three Wildernesses (2005). He is a devout Buddhist.  Life  Born in 1936 in rural Svey Rieng Province, Cambodia, French Indochina, Oeur spent his youth farming rice and herding water buffalo. He received French colonial schooling in Phnom Penh. He later moved to the U.S., where he earned a B.A. in industrial arts at California State University, Los Angeles, and an M.F.A. from the Iowa Writers‚Äô Workshop, where he was recruited as a student in poetry by Dr. Mary Gray, director of The Asia Foundation. After his education in the United States, Oeur returned to Cambodia, where he managed a cannery in Phnom Penh, worked in light industry, became a captain in the politician-general Lon Nol‚Äôs army, and served on the Cambodian delegation to the United Nations before the Khmer Rouge took over. Oeur currently resides in McKinley, Texas, where he translates the poetry of Walt Whitman into Khmer.  The Khmer Rouge Era  Oeur returned to Cambodia from the United States in 1968. In subsequent years, he witnessed the Pol Pot takeover and the rule of the Khmer Rouge, from 1975 to 1979. In 1975, Oeur and his family members were forced, along with millions of other residents of Phnom Penh, out of the city by the Khmer Rouge. In successive years, Oeur and his family were held in a series of six concentration camps. During this time, Oeur feigned illiteracy and destroyed his own literary manuscripts. In 1976, while captive, his wife gave birth to twin children who were murdered by state actors. He writes about this traumatic event in ‚ÄúThe Loss of my Twins,‚Äù translated by Ken McCullough for MƒÄNOA: A Pacific Journal of International Writing.  Poetics, themes, and influence  Oeur writes at length about his lived experience of the Cambodian genocide. Grounded in this historical and experiential context, his poems explore what it means to have one‚Äôs identity effaced, or to efface one‚Äôs own identity to avoid being killed. He also engages with a spirit of collective anguish left in the aftermath of the rule of the Khmer Rouge, projecting hope in light of the horror and violence he and other Cambodians were subjected to. In Sacred Vows, Oeur writes in traditional Cambodian forms and ‚Äú[uses] myths, stories, and history as ironic counterpoint‚Äù to the social and political situations of 1998 Cambodia. Yet Oeur, despite writing in traditional forms, has also offered a critical lens on the innovation and future of Cambodian form poetry: ‚ÄúI know these traditional forms and can write in them, which I sometimes do, but I also feel that in many ways our traditions are what allowed us to become victims‚Äîwe took things for granted, we had become hidebound and ossified,‚Äù he said in a 2001 interview with The Cambodia Daily regarding his writing on the Khmer Rouge era. ‚ÄúAnd, anyway, most of what happened to people during Pol Pot cannot be expressed in the old forms; hence, there must be more open forms to capture and preserve these things.‚Äù Of his poems, Oeur has said they offer ‚Äúphilosophical responses in a dialogue with the tradition. I do not wish to reject that tradition or negate the tradition, just breathe life into it.‚Äù He believes his role, as a poet, is to be a ‚Äúconduit of the truth,‚Äù and says that poets are ‚Äúthe conscience of the nation.‚Äù Oeur has cited Walt Whitman‚Äôs Leaves of Grass and T.S. Eliot‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Wasteland‚Äù as influences for his own work. Oeur‚Äôs memoir, Crossing Three Wildernesses, details his life story, recounting the horrors of genocide, and calling for peace and democracy. In the book, Oeur discusses ‚Äúthree wildernesses‚Äù that Cambodians encountered‚Äîand suffered through‚Äîduring the Khmer Rouge regime: death by execution, death by disease, and death by starvation. It is the first memoir from a pre-Khmer Rouge government official. Oeur has worked closely with American poet Ken McCullough, whom he met in the Iowa Writers Workshop while the two were classmates. McCullough is the translator of Oeur‚Äôs two books, Sacred Vows and Crossing Three Wildernesses. McCullough is also the author of the lyrics for a chamber opera -- ‚ÄúThe Krasang Tree‚Äù‚Äîa performance based on Oeur‚Äôs poetry and experiences. In 1998, Oeur was invited to give a poetry reading at the Minneapolis Center for Victims of Torture. After reading his poem ‚ÄúLoss of My Twins,‚Äù Oeur was approached by a female doctor from the University of Minnesota, who told him, ‚Äú[...] I thought only medicine can heal the sick. But now I know poetry can also heal the sick people, in a way that heals the emotions, the psychological trauma.‚Äù  References  Category:1936 births Category:Living people Category:Cambodian poets Category:California State University, Los Angeles alumni Category:Cambodian expatriates in the United States ","title":"U Sam Oeur"},{"id":"62554180","text":"Preben Bang Henriksen (born 11 February 1954 in N√∏rresundby) is a Danish barrister and member of Parliament of Venstre, the Liberal Party, since 15 September 2011.

It is small, compact and generally stockily built. It was established in the 1980s by fusion of the various miniature goat populations of the United Kingdom into a single breed. These were of two principal types: a stocky achondroplastic type derived from the West African Dwarf group of breeds of West Africa; and a small but well- proportioned type derived from the Southern Sudan goat.  History  From the nineteenth century small goats from Africa were brought to the United Kingdom to be exhibited in zoos. Some of these came into the hands of private breeders, who kept and bred them as companion animals. Among these there were two principal types: a broad, short-legged, compact and solid achondroplastic type, often blue roan in colour, derived from the West African Dwarf group of breeds of West Africa; and a small but well-proportioned type derived from the Southern Sudan goat. Regardless of their actual origins, the former was known as the \\"Cameroon\\" and the latter as the \\"Nigerian\\". In 1982 the varying types were merged into a single breed. A breed society ‚Äì the Pygmy Goat Club ‚Äì was formed, and a herd-book started. The breed society is not among those approved by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to operate a herd- book. In 2018 a population of 2316 head was reported to the DAD-IS breed database of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. In 2019 the conservation status of the Pygmy was listed there as \\"at risk\\"; it was not on the goat watchlist of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust.

Dana attributes the description to Charles Pickering, who was a naturalist on the expedition.  Description  Anthopleura artemisia As the name burrowing anemone suggests, the column of this animal is usually buried to a greater or lesser extent. In some individuals, the column may be completely buried, and only the oral disk and tentacles are visible. The buried portion of the column is pink or white, while the part above the substrate, if any, is green or brown. Including the buried portion, the column may reach in height. It may be up to in diameter. The upper third of the column is covered in longitudinal rows of rounded wart-like tubercules. They are sparse on the middle third, and usually absent on the lower third of the column. The tentacles are slim and tapering. They are about half the width of the oral disk in length. They and the oral disk vary in color between individuals and can be green, brown, black, pink or orange. The tentacles are often banded in white. There are rarely more than five rows of tentacles circling the oral disk. They have special fighting tentacles, acrorhagi, to attack other anemones in too close proximity. When not inflated for an attack, these are inconspicuous. They appear as a single row of round, white bumps, underneath the outer row of tentacles. Burrowing anemones are often solitary on the open coast, and are found living closer together in estuaries.  Distribution  The burrowing anemone prefers sandy, shelly, muddy, or cobbled bottoms which are loose enough for the animal to bury itself. It must have something solid, such as a rock, at the bottom of the loose layer to anchor its column. This species has been documented inhabiting holes bored by clams. It is a shallow water anemone, living in the intertidal zone down to a depth of . It prefers sheltered bays to open ocean beaches. It has been found attached to pilings and floats. These animals can be found from Alaska to southern California, including Puget Sound. The type specimen referenced in the species description came from Discovery Bay, Washington.  Life history  Burrowing anemones are gonochoric, which is to say that individuals are either male or female. Sexual reproduction occurs through broadcast spawning, where eggs and sperm are released into the sea to achieve fertilization. The releases of gametes appears to be coordinated, and mass spawning events have been observed at low tide. Fertilized eggs become free swimming larva. This species is also capable of asexual reproduction through longitudinal fission. In essence, an anemone will split into two pieces, and each will become a genetic copy of the other. Burrowing anemones are carnivores, eating unwary crabs that wander into their stinging tentacles. They are in turn preyed upon by the nudibranch Aeolidia papillosa, and likely other nudibranchs and small fish as well.

Taken prisoner to Samarra, he was pressured to convert to Islam but refused and died there. He was the father of Ashot I of Armenia, founder of the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia. Life Smbat was the younger son of Ashot IV Bagratuni, who by the time of his death in 826 had come to control a large part of Armenia, and was recognized by the Abbasid caliphs as presiding prince (ishkhan) of Armenia. After his death, Smbat and his older brother Bagrat divided their father's inheritance between them: Bagrat took the regions of Taron, Khoith and Sassoun, i.e. the family's domains on the Upper Euphrates, while Smbat received the ancestral lands around Bagaran and the Araxes river. In a calculated effort to keep the two brothers divided, the Abbasid government divided Ashot's authority and conferred on Smbat the title of commander-in-chief (sparapet) and ruler of Shirak, while Bagrat was named presiding prince four years after his father's death. Abbasid calculations proved correct, as the two brothers spent much time quarrelling with each other. In 841, for instance, Bagrat had the Armenian bishops depose the Catholicos of Armenia, John IV, but he was promptly re-installed in his see by Smbat with the assistance of the other princes. Nevertheless, the Armenian princes were able to use the Caliphate's preoccupation with the Khurramite rebellion of Babak Khorramdin to achieve a significant degree of autonomy during this period. Smbat, who had spent time at the caliphal court as a hostage, was more circumspect about openly challenging Arab power than his brother, but both were ultimately too weak to seriously threaten Abbasid predominance for the time being. When Khalid ibn Yazid al-Shaybani, who in his previous tenures had become enormously unpopular among both the Christian and the Arab princes of the country, was appointed as caliphal governor in 841, Smbat led the reaction against him. The rebels achieved his recall by the Caliph and his replacement with the weaker and more pliant Ali ibn Husayn, to whom the Armenians not only refused to hand over the expected taxes, but whom they promptly blockaded in his capital, Bardaa. When Caliph al-Wathiq () reappointed Khalid as governor, Smbat was again at the forefront of a revolt against him, alongside the Muslim rebel Sawada ibn Abd al-Hamid al-Jahhafi and Sahak, Prince of Syunik. The rebels were heavily defeated at the Battle of Kawakert, however. Like all prominent nakharar, he was taken captive by Bugha al-Kabir when he invaded Armenia in 853‚Äì855. Many of the nakharar converted to Islam to save their lives, but Smbat did not. He is venerated as a confessor for the faith by the Armenian Church. Smbat's son Ashot V Bagratuni succeeded his father as sparapet. In 862 Ashot also became \\"prince of princes\\", leading eventually to his establishment of the virtually independent Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia in 884.

Its' main goal is to reduce poverty worldwide. It consists of five other large international financial banks within in, each providing funding for different types of projects. Belarus joined the World Bank back in 1992 and has since then received over $2.5 billion in lending commitments since then and in the form of grant financing, it has received $31 million, with much of this funding going towards programs that include civil society partners. Currently, Belarus's active portfolio within the World Bank has a total of $933 million, with it containing a total of nine different projects, as well as two more projects that are currently still in preparation in the areas of energy efficiency and higher education. The majority of this funding has been directed towards the themes of pollution management and environmental health, climate change, and rural services and infrastructures, with the majority of the funding going directly into the central government, other agencies and extractives, and forestry sectors of the country, as well as sustainable energy. In looking to have more economic growth, improving the private sector environment within Belarus could help. Belarus Belarus has seen much economic struggle in the past and has struggled to recover from past economic collapses, especially with the collapse of the USSR socialist system making it one of the poorest countries in Europe at the time with around 50% of the population living below the poverty line. In the year 2000, people living within poverty was at a high of 60%, but was drastically cut to below 1% by 2013 as Belarus experienced much of its financial growth between the years of 2006-2011 as expenditures amongst the bottom 40% of the population actually increased during the financial crisis. Unemployment still remains a major issue today as less than 10% of those unemployed do not even receive welfare benefits. However, even with much of its economic advances, Belarus has since then remained on the decline due to weakness in exports and final consumption, as well as large public debt. Despite its efforts for economic growth, Belarus has long struggled with a relatively low Gross Domestic Product per capita and continues to even today due to low productivity growth and worsening external environment. Belarus's last record of Gross Domestic Product per capita has it at 6744.50 US dollars back in 2018 and a GNI per capita of 5,670.  Partnerships  Belarus has an investment portfolio within the World Bank with a total of 40 projects having been funded, totaling over $2.5 billion with two new projects underway, in association with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). The majority of funding has been directed towards the sectors of the central government, other agencies and extractives, and forestry, as well as sustainable energy. Belarus's current Country Partnership Framework for the fiscal years of 2018-2022 was encouraged and endorsed by the World Bank Board of Directors on April 3,2018 with its emphasis on: improving the contribution of infrastructure to climate change management, economic growth, and human development, creating opportunities to expand the private sector and promote more efficient public investment, as well as maintaining country's human capital edge. However, even with much work and projects underway to help stimulate economic growth, the World Bank projects growth in Belarus to be at best, 1.5% in 2019 and between 2020-2021 the poverty headcount is expected to remain flat, in relation to still positive, but much weaker economic growth, as well as fewer increases in real wages.  IBRD/IDA  The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA) have provided Belarus with about $1.988 billion in total commitments towards utility efficiency, sustainable energy, education, forestry, finance, and others across the total of 19 projects.  IFC  The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has provided Belarus about $285 million in the sectors of tourism, retail and property, manufacturing, financial institutions and others across a portfolio of 18 projects.  MIGA  The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has awarded Belarus a total of $243.5 million in guarantees to finance 3 projects, all being towards the financial sector in the country.  Reception  World Bank involvement in Belarus has been controversial to many as it has had positive and negative effects. World Bank involvement in Belarus recently has lowered its economic growth forecast from 1.8 to 1.5 percent in 2019, as well as its relatively un-changed forecast for 2020-2021 being at 1.3 and 1.2 percent.

It was produced by John James Heidegger at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in April 1707. Motteux‚Äôs prologue directly referenced Anne, Queen of Great Britain, under whose reign female stage protagonists were very popular. Action The opera is named after the historical queen Tomyris, mentioned by Herodotus as the killer of Cyrus the Great. However the action of the opera is based on a love triangle between entirely fictional characters; Thomyris‚Äô son prince Orontes and the Armenian king Tigranes, who are rivals for the affections of the Persian princess Cleora. Cleora, held captive by Orontes, falls in love with him although she is betrothed to Tigranes. The original 1707 version of the opera concludes when Thomyris intervenes to prevent the Scythians from sacrificing Cleora; she has received false news of Orontes‚Äôs death, while Tigranes is wounded in battle. In the 1709 version, Orontes reveals to the wounded Tigranes that Cleora, captured as a baby and brought up by Cyrus as his own daughter, is in fact Thomyris‚Äô daughter and thus his own sister. Cleora and Tigranes can then marry, securing peace between Scythia and Persia. Music The recitatives for the opera were composed by Johann Christoph Pepusch, who also adapted the 56 arias in the work from music by Francesco Gasparini, Giovanni Bononcini, Alessandro Scarlatti and Agostino Steffani. The overture and closing chaconne were by Charles Dieupart. Changing languages The original cast were Pepusch‚Äôs future wife Margherita de L'Epine, soprano (Thomyris), Francis Hughs, countertenor (Orontes), (later replaced by Valentino Urbani) Catherine Tofts (Cleora), Mr Lawrence, tenor (Tigranes), Richard Leveridge, bass, (Baldo) and Mary Lindsey, soprano (Media). With its original cast, the opera was first performed in English. Before long however Francis Hughs was replaced by the famous castrato Valentino Urbani. Urbani had premiered in London in Camilla in 1706, and he took over the role of Orontes in Thomyris. The subscribers wished to hear him singing in Italian, so he did, with the other parts in the opera still performed in English. By the time of its 1709 revival two more Italian singers had been added to the cast, and they too had their arias translated from English into Italian. The libretto for Thomyris was published in both English and Italian so that the audience could follow the action. However the English and Italian pages were not aligned, making it difficult to read across line by line. The songs from the opera were published by John Walsh and were very popular. Walsh was obliged to reduce the price of his edition in 1707 when John Cullen published a rival one, and he discounted it again in 1709 in the face of rival editions. Revivals The opera was revised by Nicola Francesco Haym and staged again on 10 April 1708. Margherita de L'Epine was moved to the male role of Tigranes, while the title role of Thomyris was undertaken by Haym‚Äôs wife, Joanna Maria Linchenham. There were cuts to the original work to shorten the opera and speed up the action. Thus for example in Act three the number of arias was reduced from twenty to twelve. Overall much of Pepusch‚Äôs work was cut. For the 1709/10 season Thomyris was revived once again. This time the main attraction was the famous and very expensive castrato Nicolini appearing as Tigranes, on 17, 21 and 24 November, 6 and 20 December 1709, and 3 January and 23 February 1710. Thomyris was so popular that it was revived several times between 1716 and 1728. Pepusch was involved in revising the work again, with these versions being sung entirely in English. For the 1718 revival he composed seven new arias. In total it had 43 performances between 1707 and 1728. However public taste was changing, eventually favouring opera sung entirely in Italian.

Biography  Snoussi was born in Tunis in 1989 and she began drawing at a very young age. She studied Fine Art at the Institut Sup√©rieur des Beaux-Arts in Tunis, then studied for an MA in Fine Art at Paris-Sorbonne. She currently lives and works in Paris. Initially Snoussi trained as an engraver, but currently works in ink and paint, creating large-scale pieces of work reminiscent of Hieronymous Bosch or Georges Bataille. She is outspoken about the bias against women and people of colour within the art world. She was invited to speak on art and feminism at the Pompidou Centre in 2019.  Exhibitions  In 2017 Snoussi's work was shown in the Art Paris contemporary fair, which showcased many artists from across Africa. She exhibited her body of work Le Livre des anomalies, which is an extensive narrative of illustrations drawn into faded exercise books. These works invited visitors to add to them and Snoussi is interested in breaking down the division in gallery space between artist and viewer. Snoussi's 2016 exhibition at the Tunisian Embsassy in London, explored the monstrous and featured large-scale illustration drawn directly to the embassy walls in red. Sexuality and the body is an important part of Snoussi's work, which is defined by its intertwining of the themes of science and mysticism. Paper is treated like abused skin through cutting, puncturing and drawing. She has exhibited her work consistently since 2013, with exhibitions, amongst others, in: Climbing through the Tide (Tunis, 2019), Galerie LaLalande (Paris, 2019), Art Brussels (2018), Somerset House (London, 2017), Platform Parallel (Tunis, 2016), Cit√© Internationale des arts (Paris, 2015), Jazz Festival (Carthage, 2014), Galerie Yahia (Tunis, 2013).  LGBTQ* Art in Tunisia  Snoussi's queer identity is also important in the expression of her work. She explores how the monstrous visions in her work relate to create queer alternatives to the authoritarian Tunisian state. In 2019 she was one of thirteen artists chosen to exhibit in Paris to mark International Day Against Homophobia. Her mix of monstrosity and queerness acts to confound Tunisian traditional values. Queerness only emerged in women's art in Tunisia in the 2010s and Snoussi is at the forefront of its development.

These include Phoma herbarum and Phoma exigua, and possibly other as yet unidentified species. Phoma infection may cause decreased yields, but Phoma wilt is not considered to be a very common or destructive disease of the hop plant.  Hosts and symptoms  Phoma herbarum and P. exigua have both been found to have wide host specificity, although the hop plant appears to be the only common host of the two. There have not been any indications found of cultivar specificity, although hop yards established for a longer time may have a higher risk of Phoma infection . Symptoms of infection typically begin with small chlorotic leaf spots and develop into greyish brown lesions that have a distinct target or concentric ring appearance . In some instances, the lesions may also be greyish white in color. Infection of the hop cones will produce brown or red discoloration covering some or all of the bracts of the hop cone . This discoloration is an indication of necrosis on the cones . The plant may also develop cankers or wilt, but this is not seen in all cases . Phoma wilt of hops may be diagnosed by its characteristic symptoms or by isolation and DNA sequencing of the pathogen against known genomes . Interestingly, P. herbarum and P. exigua have also both been considered as bioherbicide agents against some species of broadleaf weeds.  Disease cycle  Phoma wilt in hops has been found to be spread by pycnidiospores. These asexual spores are released from mature pycnidia in a matrix which may appear white or pink . Dissemination occurs largely by rain splash, wind, or misting, but spores may also be carried by bird or insect vectors from plant to plant . Infection, which typically becomes evident in late Summer, may occur by spores entering through stomata or wounds in the plant but may also enter directly through the epidermis . Spores will then bud and divide, and hyphae will branch out . The initial infection is symptom-less as the pathogen spreads. However, once the pathogen becomes necrotrophic, necrotic lesions will appear . Pycnidia formation begins with hyphae near the epidermis in lesions forming a cavity followed by the production of dark hyphal cells. The aggregation will continue to grow in size until it is mature. Spore production starts from the inner cells of the pycnidia, and stalks of spores project inward in columns from those cells . Spores are oblong and generally measure approximately 5.0 x 2.5 Œºm . There is no sexual stage for either P. herbarum or P. exigua that has been identified, but many other species of Phoma have been found with a Didymalla teleomorph. In the absence of a host, P. herbarum and P. exigua can act saprophytically survive in plant debris or decaying material .  Environment  Phoma wilt of hops generally requires rain for dissemination by rain splash, but there is some evidence that it may thrive from periods of dryness with interspersed, shorter periods of wetness . Repeatedly growing hops in the same area where Phoma wilt occurred previously increases disease incidence rate, as the pathogen is able to survive in debris and material on the ground. There is also evidence that birds and insects which frequent the hop plant may act as transient vectors of the disease .  Management  There are currently no specific management techniques described for Phoma Wilt in Hops . However, several methods have been proposed. The simplest cultural method is the removal of plant debris from hop yards which may help reduce the spread of the disease as well as initial infection in new stock . This functions by effectively removing any resting spores, pycnidia, or saprophytic pathogen. Any diseased plants or plant material should also be removed. Because the disease prefers moist condition for dissemination, it may also be helpful to ensure hop plants have adequate airflow . This likely, not an issue though due to the way hop vines are guided upward on wires. It is also important to water the hop plants from the ground as opposed to misting or sprinkler type systems which will create or prolong a moist environment where the pathogen can thrive. Because the pathogen is also able to survive in the soil, growing a non-host plant in the area for 4+ years could be used to halt future infection; however, the longevity of the hop plant rhizome may reduce the efficiency of this cultural practice. Sterile practice should also be used when pruning, transporting, or propagating stock to impede the spread of the pathogen. There are fungicides available that have an action against the Phoma species seen in hops, but none specifically registered for Phoma wilt in hops, though chemical treatments have been proposed for treatment of the disease. These include tebuconazole, trifloxystrobin, fosetyl-Al, and copper hydroxide for their action against fungi in general . Tebuconazole is a systemic fungicide which interferes with membrane functions and pathogen survival within the hop plant . The fungicide trifloxystrobin acts by interfering with some aspects of fungal pathogen respiration, resulting in inhibition of both growth and spore germination . This functionally stops the initial infection or subsequent growth. Fosetyl-Al has a less distinct mode of action, likely having fungicidal properties by stimulating defense mechanisms in the host plant itself . Fosetyl-Al may therefore help decrease the spread of the Phoma infection in hop plant tissues, but this has yet to be studied more closely. Copper hydroxide is a widely used foliar applied fungicide which denatures proteins on the plant surface and inhibits pathogen forced entry . This may not be completely effective against Phoma, as it is also able to enter through wounds and natural openings.

Biography  Hori was born to a scholarly family in Hirakawacho, in Tokyo, Japan, in 1918. In 1940, she graduated from Women's School of Fine Arts (now Joshibi University of Art and Design). She trained in Nihonga, a traditional Japanese painting style. In 1952, she won the Uemura Sh≈çen Award, given to outstanding Japanese female painters. In 1960, Hori's husband, a diplomat, died of tuberculosis. Hori decided to travel the world, leaving Japan for the first time and visiting Egypt, Europe, the United States and Mexico. Upon her return to Japan, she moved to the Kanagawa countryside and created works inspired by her travels. The natural world, including flowers and animals, was a theme of her work throughout her career. From the 1950s to the 1970s, Hori created illustrations for magazines and children's books, including a 1971 picture book adaption of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker that won an award at the Bologna Children's Book Fair. She also taught painting at Tama Art University. In 1987, she won the Kanagawa Culture Prize. Hori lived in Arezzo, in Tuscany, Italy, for five years from 1987, setting up a studio there and painting colourful images of the local setting. She continued to travel to countries around the world, including such destinations as the Amazon, Nepal, and Mexico. In 2000, she survived life-threatening aneurysm; she was inspired by this experience to paint microorganisms, as viewed under a microscope. This work appeared in a solo exhibition at Nakajima Art Gallery in Ginza, Tokyo. A ceramic piece based on one of her paintings, Utopia, was installed in the lobby of Fukushima Airport in 2014. Hori continued to paint into her final years. The Museum of Modern Art in Hayama showed a retrospective of her work from November 2017 to March 2018; the earliest piece was a self-portrait from 1930, and the most recent piece was Red-Flowering Japanese Apricot, painted in 2016 when Hori was 98 years old. Hori died on February 5, 2019, at a hospital in Hiratsuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, at age 100. The Narukawa Art Museum in Hakone, home of over 100 of her works, hosted a memorial exhibition from July to November 2019.

Education Tham was involved in work in 2000 with the lab of Barbara Baker on the tobacco mosaic virus resistance gene N in tobacco plants at University of California, Berkeley, using deletion studies to identify important amino acids in the structure of the protein to fight off the virus. Tham was awarded her BA at University of California, Berkeley and her PhD at Princeton University with Virginia Zakian. During her PhD Tham studied telomeres of yeast, showing that the localisation of the left telomere of chromosome IV at the periphery of the nuclear membrane was essential for, but not sufficient, to prevent gene expression.  Career  Tham continued to work on yeast for her next project in the lab of Angelika Amon; using strains with individual genes deleted to identify genes involved in the separation of chromosomes during meiosis. Disruption of these genes in the deletion strains led to nondisjunction. Tham also participated in identifying the protein FPR3 as a member of the recombination checkpoint program during meiosis. Tham first started working on malaria in the lab of Alan Cowman at WEHI. Here she identified the human red blood cell protein complement-receptor 1 (CR1) as the binding partner for the Plasmodium falciparum (the major human malaria) invasion protein Rh4. Her further work in the same lab found the binding sites on the CR1 peptide for Rh4, and proved that phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tails of Rh4 and other invasion proteins (sections of surface membrane proteins inside the cell) were essential for the malaria parasite to be able to penetrate red blood cells. In 2018, Tham's lab proved that the P. vivax reticulocyte-binding protein binds the human transferrin receptor 1 protein in order to invade early red blood cells (reticulocytes). The same year, following on from this work, Tham's lab published a cryo-EM structure of the two proteins complexed together. This structure showed where antibody binding sites can obstruct the interaction and prevent host cell invasion.  Awards and accolades  Tham was named a Howard Hughes Medical Institute-Wellcome Trust International Research scholar in 2017. In 2018 the WEHI institute awarded Tham the Burnet Prize for work on the binding of P. vivax parasites and red blood cells, and the University of Melbourne awarded her the David Syme Research Prize. In 2019 Tham was a member of a team of P. vivax researchers from WEHI awarded the Australian Museum Eureka Prize. The 2020 International Prize from the Biochemical Society was awarded to Tham.

It has been found in both shallow water and deep-water assemblages no older than 560 Ma placing it within the youngest Ediacaran.  Description  Annulatubus, meaning ringed tube, possesses a long tube-like structure with uniformly spaced ridges. At lengths between 178mm, and 250mm, and widths between 15mm and 50mm it is significantly larger than most other tube-like fossils of the Ediacaran. It is described as having a similar ringed tube structure to Sekwitibulus but differs in size and ridge shape. It is unknown if Annulatubus possessed a holdfast like other similar Ediacarans.  Diversity  The only known species within the genus Annulatubus flexuosus.  Discovery  Annulatubus flexuosus was discovered in the Blueflower formation from the Mackenzie Mountains of Northwest Canada. In 2008 a similar Ediacaran was discovered from the late Ediacaran Khatyspyt formation of Northern Siberia by Dmitriy V. Grazhdankin, Uwe Balthasar, Konstantin E. Nagovitsin, and Boris B. Kochnev. Carbone et al. recognized the specimen that Grazhdankin et al. described as belonging to the Annulatubus genus but not enough material exists to recognize it as A. flexuosus or a new species.  Distribution  Annulatubus has been found in the sandstone beds of the Blueflower Formation in Northwest Canada and within the mudstones of the Khatyspyt Formation of Northern Siberia.

Due to its uncertain international status, the World Bank does not currently extend any financial loans to the TRNC. However, other types of cooperation exist.  The international status as it relates to the World Bank  The world bank recognizes and works with 189 member countries which are allowed to receive funding from various branches of the World Bank such as the IBRD or the IDA. Due to its uncertain political status, TRNC as a state cannot receive financial funding from any branch of the World Bank. In its SABER report, the world bank refers to TRNC\`s governmental institutions in quotations, in which they specifically state that use of governmental names as it appears in TRNC\`s constitution does not suggest a recognition of the state itself.  World Bank involvement   2016 SABER Report  The contributions made by the World Bank to the TRNC consist of guidelines and detailed reports about the economy. The SABER (Systems Approach for Better Educational Results) report focused on three main points: \\"Strategic Framework\\", \\"System Oversight\\" and \\"Service Delivery\\". The Turkish Cypriot community scored 2.5, 2.0 and 1.9 respectively in three areas of the Work Force development framework, being rated as an \\"Emerging\\" country in terms workforce development. The main recommendations World Bank officials made in their report was improvements in the budget allocated for job-specific training schemes, setting its socio-economic goals at achievable levels and improving the technology for data collection.  Peace in Cyprus and the World Bank  An EU-funded survey was carried out in December 2018 by the World Bank. This survey aimed to gather data from both communities and put it into circulation in an effort to promote peace on the island through better informing both the Turkish Cypriot and the Greek Cypriot communities. The most striking statistic that was obtained during the survey was the 173% increase in the total number of motor vehicles passing the border from the Greek Cypriot side into the Turkish Cypriot territory. Overall, both communities displayed a more positive attitude towards a solution to the Cyprus problem.  Economic repercussions of unification for Cypriots  In an interview conducted by a Turkish Cypriot and a Greek Cypriot journalists with Dirk Reinermann, who is the manager of Southern Europe and a team of Economists at the World Bank, Reinermann made remarks about the World Bank\`s official position regarding unification on the island. Overall, Reinermann posits that a reunified Cyprus would be beneficial for both communities. However, the structural discrepancies between the EU-regulated Greek Cypriot banking and financial sectors relative to the unregulated Turkish Cypriot banking and financial sectors would make economic convergence of the two communities a challenge. Nevertheless, ‚ÄúA bigger pie to share\\" sums up Reinermann\`s stance on the economic benefits of reunification.  World Bank research on higher education Relative to its small population, the TRNC has a very large international student population. Whilst the Turkish Cypriot community had 300,000 inhabitants in 2016, the country attracted around 85,000 students. Therefore, the World Bank report has indicated the fact that higher education seems to be a high-potential avenue through which the TRNC could grow economically. Whilst 60 percent of all students are from Turkey, this provides readily available highly educated labor for both the public and private sectors. At the same time, the weaknesses of the Turkish Cypriot higher education system includes the very small number of Turkish Cypriot students and the \\"limited absorptive capacity\\" of the Economy. The most important recommendation the report makes is the regulation of the quality of education offered by the Turkish Cypriot authorities.

He employed diverse painting styles and collage to draw attention to the shortcomings of mass media.  Life  Luster Willis was born on December 25, 1913. He attended school until the eighth grade, and began full-time agricultural labor thereafter. In the spring and summer he assisted his father in maintenance of their 60-acre farm. In the winter he felled trees and made cross ties for the Illinois Central Railroad. He married Louvennia Bozman on November 10, 1934, and though they had no children of their own, they raised two younger cousins together. In 1943, he was recruited to join the American war effort during World War II. He was stationed in Europe for three years, and it was in Germany, France, and Austria where he first encountered fine art. He was discharged from the military in 1947. He returned to Egypt Hill, Mississippi and attended the Magnolia Trade School in Jackson, Mississippi for his barber's certification. Willis's father died in 1963 and Willis inherited his farm, where he lived the remainder of his life. After a sudden stroke in 1986, Willis was unable to create more art work. He died just a few years after in 1991.  Career  Willis showed an interest in and talent for art at a very young age. However, his teachers discouraged his artistic interests, disregarding them as impractical and frivolous. Nonetheless, Willis continued to draw and practice his creativity. During the Great Depression, he carved walking sticks for his neighbors in Mississippi, vowing to \\"put a cane in the hand of every elderly person in his small town.\\" His canes, featuring solo human figures at the head of the cane, were so successful that they were his main wource of income during the Depression, charging between 75 cents and five dollars each. When Willis inherited his father's farm in 1963, he had more space and freedom to create in his own way, and thus began to seriously paint and draw for the first time. Shortly thereafter, his work was discovered by William Ferris, the director of the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi.  Subject and materials  Willis's paintings are made form a variety of paper and materials. He tries to achieve subtle, three-dimensional shifts by painting on different kinds of paper with various thicknesses and collaging them together on the same canvas. Willis refers to this product as a \\"set-in\\" because the different materials are set together like puzzle pieces. Willis used primarily watercolors and acrylic paints on paper, pasteboard, cardboard, and plywood. Occasionally, to achieve more depth, he would add shoe polish or gold or silver glitter to the edges of the \\"set-in\\" pieces. As for the canes that Willis carved, his early ones were carved out of hickory wood, but he later switched to cedar for its suppleness and elasticity. Throughout his career, Willis has made approximately 300 drawings and paintings and at least that many canes. His works on paper range from 9\\" x 12\\" to 30 inches square.  Inspiration and process  Willis noted doing his best work during lonely periods, at night in the winter and early spring, in which his imaginary and material worlds could combine. He typically painted in front of his fireplace late at night, treating it as his studio space. He covered the surrounding walls with photographs of his family, friends, and community members‚Äîlooking to them for inspiration while painting. These photographs helped him focus on certain aspects of his paintings that he wanted to emphasize, such as eyes. \\"I work on the eyes a lot, too, touching them up to try to make them look more human like. Maybe sometimes I overdo it.\\" Willis's process was just as often motivated by a specific image he could picture in his mind, as it was by a stream of consciousness creativity driven by no preconceived idea. The concept of death fascinated Willis and lead to many paintings featuring characters in caskets. His first painting about death was a reflection on the murder of Emmett Till. As a black man living in the Mississippi throughout the 20th Century, Willis saw death and violence affect his community in visceral ways. He noted, \\"I think death is interesting because it's something that, sooner or later, we all will have to meet.\\" Willis paints his lived experiences and real or imagined community with vivid realism, saying \\"I draw from life to emphasize it, to speak through a picture what can't be brought into words.\\" This condensed imagery communicates ubiquitous narratives found in his community and the communities of other African American artists living in the rural American South.

Eugene Kelly was born in County Tyrone, Ireland, the son of Thomas Boye O'Kelly. At the age of twenty-four he emigrated to the United States, and became a clerk in the mercantile house of Donnelly Bros, New York. After a few years, he removed to Maysville, Kentucky, and went into business, but later on established himself in St. Louis. When the California Gold Rush began, he saw the opportunity and went to San Francisco in the latter part of 1849, opening a mercantile establishment there in partnership with Joseph A. Donohoe, Daniel T. Murphy and Adam Grant. After ten years of business, the firm dissolved, and Kelly took part in founding the Pacific Coast banking house of Donohoe, Ralston & Co., in San Francisco, and the firm of Eugene Kelly & Co., in New York. In 1894, Kelly retired and the house was dissolved. He was a factor in railroad business and banking for a third of a century. He founded the Southern Bank of the State of Georgia and contributed largely to the rebuilding of the town hall of Charleston, South Carolina, after the Civil War. He was a director in the National Park Bank, the Bank of New York, the Equitable Life Assurance Society, the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank, and the Title Guarantee and Trust Company; he was also connected with many other financial and railroad corporations. He was known as a supporter of arts, charity and education: he was one of the original life members of the National Academy of Design, for thirteen years a member of the New York City Board of Education, a patron of the American Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and a member of the New York Chamber of Commerce. In 1884, he was Elector-at-Large and chairman of the New York Electoral College. In the Roman Catholic Church, of which he was a member, he was a prominent layman, being one of the founders of the Catholic University of America, and a director until his death. He was also a trustee of Seton Hall College and a member of the committees which had oversight of the construction of St. Patrick‚Äôs Cathedral, the Washington Square Arch and the Statue of Liberty erected in New York Harbor. The first wife of Eugene Kelly died in 1848. His daughter, Eugenia, by this marriage, became the wife of James A. G. Beales of New York. In 1857, he married Margaret Hughes, niece of Archbishop John Hughes, and four sons by this marriage survived him ‚Äî Eugene, Edward, Thomas Hughes and Robert J. Kelly. He died in New York following a paralytic stroke.

Importance  The host of the fungal pathogen, Syringa vulgaris or the common lilac, is an ancient plant with significance in horticultural activities and wild roots in eastern Europe. Its Latin epithet, vulgaris, translates into ‚Äòcommon‚Äô in English, and was popularized by the pioneer taxonomist Carl von Linn√©. One of the first dutiful observations of the pathogen, E. syringae, was made in a journal of the German Botanical Society, Berichte der Deutschen Botanische Gesellschaft, where it was observed as a powdery mildew pathogen unique to lilacs referencing the physical characteristics of its ascocarp appendages. The pathogen contributes to a deathly and diseased look. Common lilac is known for its spring flowers, which can be altered due to decay of flowering stems after intense infection.  Symptoms  Powdery mildew of lilac leaves an opaque- white discoloration on the leaves of S. vulgaris. This process is predominant at the end of the season but can begin to take place during new growth. Eventually the fungal pathogen contributes to the damaging and early senescing of the infected leaves. The opaque-white discoloration is mycelial growth along the surface of the leaf. When the pathogen is sufficiently advanced, the presence of small dark dots indicates the production of cleistothecium (chasmothecium), an important structure in the protection of potential inoculum.  Treatment  There are methods to treat powdery mildew using home-made preparations including fresh milk, which contains the active anti- pathogenic compound lecithin. Lecithin is recognized by the European Union as a treatment for powdery mildews diseases and is commonly available in the soy- derived formulation ‚Äòsoy lecithin‚Äô. Other experimental treatments include using baking soda (disrupts pH), neem oil (fungicidal properties), or sulfur containing solutions. Historically, flowers of sulfur has been prepared into a dust and applied to the leaves. Synthetic compounds such as thiophanate- methyl , propiconazole , and chlorothalonil are used to treat variety of powdery mildew diseases, as well as other fungal pathogens. Many chemical treatments are known to contribute to disease resistance, and can be harmful if not used with appropriate caution. Compounds with high risk such as thiophanate-methyl can be referred to in the FRAC (Fungicide Resistance Action Committee) Code List document. To avoid health risks refer to the product's label and the appropriate Material Safety Data Sheet. Cultural controls such as selective pruning can prevent suitable environmental conditions of the pathogen by increasing air circulation. Collection and destruction of plant debris can disrupt the pathogen‚Äôs life cycle.

It is the lead single for their fourth studio album Vena, produced by Brandon Paddock, written by Masato Hayakawa and was released on 16 September 2015. It was the first song written for the album, and received critical success among critics. This song is highly regarded as the best that Coldrain has to offer and is a popular staple song at live shows among international fans. An acoustic version was released on the followup 2016 maxi-single release Vena II.  Composition  \\"Gone\\" is a post-hardcore, hard rock and alternative rock song. The track runs at 180 BPM and is in the key of E minor. It runs for four minutes and 12 seconds. The song was written by Masato Hayakawa, Brandon Paddock, and Ryo Yokochi, Paddock also handled the production of the single as well as the entirety of the album.  Lyrics  When asked about the latest single, Masato had a lot to say about the meaning and where some of the foundations came from. He revealed that the claps were implemented to help with the atmosphere and help make the song that much more memorable and is great when fans clap along with the intro at the start of every performance. He also mentioned about how personal this song was to him, as he initially didn't want to share it with the studio. However, Brandon Paddock had other ideas and thought it would be a great lead single for the record. Later on, it was admitted that he was happy that they made the correct decision to use it to promote the record. Regarding the meaning of the song, this is what the lead-vocalist, Masato David Hayakawa, had to say: > ‚Äú'Gone' is about giving someone you love everything you have and holding > onto them until it just falls apart. The feeling you get when you feel so > distant from someone despite them saying they‚Äôre there for you and they care > about you. I have a feeling a lot of people have had this kind of > experience. The anger, frustration and mixed emotions are what we put into > this song and video.‚Äù  Track listing   Promotion and release  Days leading up the release, there were teasers posted on social media to hype the debut of their latest single. A tweet which got everyone buzzing on Twitter was when Hayakawa put a post stating the world premiere for the music video was tomorrow, followed by a short clip of the intro of the song. Upon release, the song received substantial airplay on Sirius XM, Octane, BBC Radio 1 and Kerrang! leading to a lot of hype for their upcoming album. As a result, the song received a lot of critical acclaim.  Music video  The music video for \\"Gone\\" was released alongside the single on September 16, 2015, and was directed by Maxilla. The video revolves around a couple who are shown to be happy, sad and have rough patches. They eventually call it quits and then realise what they had, that spark, is now gone. Mirrors shattering are also a centre point, and helps convey the idea of reflecting on what they had which is now fading away into dust. In the end, it is revealed that she left him behind after the realisation hits that she is gone for good. Intertwined with the music, silhouettes of the band members are shown playing the song with bright studio lights of the albums logo flashing around them. As of August 2020, the song has 4.6 million views on YouTube, being Coldrain's third most viewed music video on the site.

Soule, 1870) Nelder is a giant sequoia located within the Nelder Grove of Sequoia National Forest in California. It is the largest tree in Nelder Grove, the 23rd largest giant sequoia in the world, and could be considered the 22nd largest depending on how badly Ishi Giant atrophied during the Rough Fire in 2015. Description Nelder is located northwest of a hairpin turn along \\"Graveyard of the Giants Trail\\" at the end of an unofficial branching trail. The base of the tree, much like the surrounding trees, was charred during the 2017 Railroad Fire. History On July 3, 1859, naturalist Galen Clark, Judge John W. Fitzhugh, and journalist L.A. Holmes discovered the tree while on a hunting expedition in the area. In 1875, prospector-turned-hermit John A. Nelder built a cabin near the tree, which he considered to be the largest in the world. Nelder met naturalist John Muir later that same year, but when Muir measured the tree, he determined it to be smaller than the Grizzly Giant tree of Mariposa Grove. Nelder's tree, though narrower, was later found to be taller and more voluminous than the Grizzly Giant, making it the second largest giant sequoia in the region after the Washington tree of Mariposa Grove.

Early Years Button was born in New London, Connecticuthttp://gravesideproject.ca/?p=965 to Joseph Button and Mary Ann Atwell.https://digginrootsblog.wordpress.com/2013/08/21/yorks-founding- fathers-buttonville/ He was the fourth generation of Buttons in America (the first ancestor is believed to be Matthias Button (1610-1672), who arrived in the Boston, Massachusetts Bay Colony around 1633).https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Button-37 In 1790 John Button was working as a cooper and married Elizabeth Williams (1772-1847) in Dutchess County, New York in 1795. With the end of the American Revolution and not being an active United Empire Loyalist, Button would not begin the process of migrating north to Canada until the ratification of the Jay Treaty in 1795. In 1798 he petitioned the then President of the Executive Council and Administrator of Upper Canada Peter Russell for land in Upper Canada. Not waiting for the approval of his request his family settled in at Crowland Township (in now Welland, Ontario) in the Niagara Region (with family members already residents in the township) from 1799 to 1801. Once the grant was approved in 1801 (by Peter Hunter) they settled on 200 acres (81 ha) of land along Yonge Street (somewhere north of Bloor Street as Park lots ran north‚Äìsouth direction south of Bloor) in York, Upper Canada. He later sold this grant, moved north to Markham in 1803 and obtained 200 acres (81 ha) around the area now known as Buttonville, Ontario around 1805.http://www.uelac.org/events/Major-John- Button-War-of-1812.pdf Military Career Button joined the local militia in 1808 as a Lieutenant with the North York Regiment of Militia and established his cavalry troop, Light Dragoons, in 1810.

Legacy Ngum's style of music is rooted in the ultra-traditional Senegambian music traditions that recalls the great empires, kingdoms, kings, queens and heroes of precolonial Senegambia. His lyrics are filled with goodwill messages and wisdom designed to educate his listeners of their history and culture, and the virtues of a good citizen. His Pan-African believes are evident in his songs. He was one of the most famous Baifall (fr) of his generation. He was a revolutionary Baifall and an ambassador to the Baifall sect. For decades, Ngum championed for a more united Senegambia (Senegal and Gambia)‚Äìunder one president. He believed that, a united Senegambia would make a United States of Africa possible, because Senegalese and Gambians are the same people, speak the same languages, and share the same history and culture. Geographically, the Gambia is inside Senegal, surrounded by Senegal on all three sides. Historically, the people lived in kingdoms and empires, and the creation and separation of the two states was only a result of European colonization. For decades, Ngum created his own style of fashion where he wore unmatching shoes. He used to call one of the pair \\"Senegal\\" and the other \\"Gambia\\". For many years, that became his trademark and symbolized his belief in the unification of the two States under one president and for a possible United Africa. On one of his last intervivws with the Senegalese television network TFM‚Äìrecorded some hours before his death, the topic of his unmatching shoes were brought up again by the TV anchor. Ngum told the interviewer that he would not stop wearing none-matching shoes until and unless there is one Senegambia led by one president. He said that his dream was to see Senegal and Gambia united under one president.Freedom Newspaper, Veteran Gambian Musician Musa Ngum Dies! by Pa Nderry M'Bai (October 11, 2015) (retrieved February 13, 2020) In the Senegambia region, Ngum is regarded as a musical hero.

The IMF would have a strong influence over the economy of Chile through the post-World War Two era of the 20th century, especially during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.  History of IMF - Chile relations   Overthrow of Allende and Rise of the Chicago Boys  In 1973 the democratically elected government of marxist Salvador Allende was overthrown in a coup launched by the military of Chile. General Augusto Pinochet became leader of the nation and he set the nation on a path of laissez-faire economics, hoping to gain favor with the United States. Pinochet gave control of the economy to a group of economist who became known as the \\"Chicago Boys\\" due to many of them having been trained in economics at the University of Chicago. In the immediate wake of the coup inflation had reached a record annual rate of over 500%, and amongst the first goals of the Chicago Boys was to bring this under control. The overthrow of Allende was seen as a positive development by the major world financial institutions, and the IMF quickly began talks with the new government. IMF gave increasingly large loans to the junta, providing 79 million dollars in loans in both 1975 and 76. Inflation would decrease through the 70s, and the government budget was cut as the public sector was increasingly cut.  Increased IMF Intervention  By the early 1980s Chile's economic experiment took a turnt for the worst. Inflation began to increase again and the amount of the population in poverty increased drastically, reaching over 40% of the population The shock economics of the Chicago Boys lost favor with the dictatorship, and one by one they were forced out and replaced by more moderate economists. These economists were not given the same amount of freedom to experiment, and so the influence of the IMF over the economy greatly increased. Even more free market reforms were passed, and the size of IMF loans was drastically increased. In 1985 alone over 800 million dollars was loaned out to Chile.  Modern Day  Since the return to democracy Chile has taken no loans out from the IMF, instead working to decrease its level of debt. Chilean economics are still in line with the advice given to it by the IMF in the decades prior, evident by being ranked the most business friendly country in Latin America. Within the IMF Chile currently contributes over 1,700,000 SDRs, giving it a vote share of 18,908.

This degeneration causes compressions in soft tissues and nerve root locations in the ultimate caudal area of the medulla, causing neuropathic pain in the lumbar vertebrae.  Signs and symptoms  DLSS has been found to affect dogs between the ages of 7 and 8, males ranging twice as higher than females in the research area. Medium to large-sized working breeds with high rates of activity are mostly affected by this disease, the German Shepherd breed being the most common on DLSS diagnosis. Common symptoms in dogs are physical difficulties in normal daily activities, such as: * Mild to severe pain when walking (dragged hind limbs). * Discomfort when ascending or descending stairs. * Lumbar disturbances when resting or lying down. * Unwillingness to perform exercise. * Urinal and defecation discomfort. Behavioural problems will also be presented in dogs affected by DLSS, due to the pain they suffer on their lower back. It has been researched that there is a positive correlation regarding a dog's behaviour with the amount of lumbar vertebrae that are affected by this disease, respectively showing that behavioural disturbances are more likely to appear with dogs that have 3+ affected vertebrae. Symptoms such as anxiety, sudden loss of appetite, or mild aggressiveness when performing physical activities can become clear signs of this disease.  Research  DLSS is associated with behavioural problems depending on how much the disease affects the dog; in other words, the more tissue and bone that is affected by DLSS, the more reluctant the dog will be to perform any kind of physical activity. Its most general overview and research ground for understanding this pathological disease takes place in the military, since dogs who take part in the special forces (German and Dutch Shepherd, Labrador Retriever and Belgian Malinois being the most proper breeds) are widely studied as they progress through their incredibly active life. Those affected by DLSS, generally diagnosed in their retirement period, show a wide range of decreased activity when performing certain demanding tasks that require physical stress, thus, becoming crucial exemplars for lumbar diseases. Diagnosis DLSS is commonly identified through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) due to their precision in recognising abnormalities in soft tissue and small bone structures.  Treatment  Medical treatment is necessary to correct this lumbar disease, generally varying from anti-inflammatory drugs (lacking steroids, such as: tramadol and gabapentin) to surgical correction; surgery being the most effective of course. Dorsal Laminectomy is the most common procedure for DLSS treatment, which implies the decompression or des-inflammation of soft tissues and nerve roots.‚ÜµSurgical fusion of the lumbosacral vertebrates has also been found to improve the affected vertebrae, since it reduces motion by eliminating certain nerve compressions located in the vertebral canal. Specific facetectomy (fat surgery) can also be performed in order to maintain stability in the affected joint tissue. Alternative conservative or non- surgical treatment is also a convenient option with dogs that have not fully developed Degenerative Lumbosacral Stenosis; ranging from regular walks to underwater exercises that aid the affected lumbar vertebrae decompress and tone the corresponding muscle. Statistically, physiotherapy has a success rate of 79% in all affected patients. If there is no surgical intervention, oral tramadol and alternative gabapentin have shown to decrease the neuropathological pain dogs suffer when affected by the disease.

Located in the hundreds-year-old Cha'er hutong, a Chinese courtyard, surrounded by family homes, the award-winning structure is recognized for its blend of old and new architecture. Funded by the municipal government, the building is part of an urban development program to enhance the lives of residents while preserving hutong history.  Micro Hutong Renewal  Zhang Ke of ZAO/standard architecture in Beijing designed the children's library and art centre as part of a hutong renewal project. Ke has a Master of Architecture from Harvard and is credited with bringing Ivy League design to the hutongs. The architect believes it is good for the municipality to use small-scale construction as part of urban development. Located about one kilometre from Tiananmen Square and near a major mosque, the Cha'er hutong measures 350 square metres. It was a typical Da-Za-Yuan, which means big, messy courtyard, where up to a dozen families had lived for about 400 years. The hutong contained a temple that was turned into residences in the 1950s. The municipal government's Dashilar Investment requested proposals for how to use the space, choosing a children's library. The project's construction took place between 2012 and 2014. Since the 1950s, most families living there had added on a small kitchen in the courtyard. Although most recent renovations eliminate add-on structures like these, the architects redesigned, renovated, and reused the remaining structures to create the library and art spaces, preserving this oft-neglected layer of Beijing's contemporary civil history. The builders constructed the 9 metre square library beneath the pitched roof of another building in the courtyard. It is made of plywood and concrete mixed with Chinese ink to blend with its grey urban surroundings. Steps inside the building create an elevated reading area in front of a wide window, encouraging children to climb up and read a book. Builders also transformed a former kitchen beneath a large Chinese scholar tree into a six-metre square micro art space using recycled bricks. In 2016, the Hutong Children's Library and Art Centre project received the Aga Khan Award for Architecture, one of six winners worldwide. The award jury praised the project for its modification and re-use of a historic building and its embodiment of life in traditional courtyard residences. The hutong renewal project appeared at Beijing Design Week 2014 and the Venice Architecture Biennale 2016. CNN called the architect a \\"game changer in Chinese design\\" for his various courtyard projects.  Facilities  The building contains a children's library and an elevated reading nook where children can read in front of a picture window. There is a miniature art space nearby. In one room, an artist may show children how to create paper cut art while a multifunction space is suitable for showing movies. A large, hundreds-year-old scholar tree at the site provides a place for children to play.  Social Impact  Local residents see the hutong renewal project as good for the community as the area was transformed from piles of rubbish to a place where children come to play and learn. Hutong life revived through this project and enriched community bonds. The project helped preserve historic buildings instead of leveling the area for large-scale construction, bridging the gap between modern development and tradition. Hutong renewal helps keep families in the community where they have lived possibly for hundreds of years instead of relocating to distant apartment towers, preserving their community bonds.

Botswana is part of the Kalahari desert, approximately 70% of the country is based here. It was once a part of the British protectorate, before it gained its independence in 1966 under a commonwealth. Since then, Botswana has been able to see strong development in humanitarian, social growth and economic growth. Most of their economic growth is due to their production of diamonds, which allowed it to become an upper middle-class country. It is currently home to 2.3 million people.  Relation with World Bank  The goal of the world bank is to consolidate Botswana‚Äôs progress while also looking at a range of areas and noting its problem areas. Botswana is a strong US ally and has consistently worked with the world bank to create projects. Botswana first joined the organization on July 24, 1968, which was only 2 years after it gained independence. Its first major project with the World Bank was a Roads and Water project, which was to develop the transportation system in the city of Bechuanaland. Since then, it has looked towards the world bank to fund other projects that encompass the world bank‚Äôs mantra. As of recently, Botswana has 2 major projects. One is the Integrated Transport Project, estimated to cost $186 million, and the Emergency Water Security and Efficiency Project, estimated to cost $145.5 million. Both were introduced in March 2017 and are currently being worked on. Apart from the World Bank utilizing its funding mechanisms in Botswana, it also provides analytical and advisory support. The World Bank conducted 3 projects that coincide with one another, they incorporate electricity transmission, economic diversification and strengthen public sector performance. In relation the World Bank‚Äôs private sector, being the International Finance Cooperation (IFC), they have 2 projects in the works. There is the IFC Kgalagadi Bond, which will turn the Botswana Building Society into a full service, commercial bank. The other project looks at the water sector and it aims to have advisory support for the Glen Valley Waste Water Treatment Plan.  Country Partnership Framework  Botswana currently has a Country Partnership Framework for the FY16-FY20, which is the World Bank‚Äôs way to make their, ‚Äúcountry driven model more systematic, evidence-based, selective and focused on the bank‚Äôs goals of ending extreme poverty and increasing shared prosperity.\\" The main areas for this framework is promoting private sector jobs, strengthening assets and having effective resource management.  Past development projects   The Botswana National HIV/AIDS Prevention Project  Botswana was experiencing one of the most severe HIV/AIDS epidemics of the world in the early 2000s. The Botswana government was in a state of ‚Äúemergency‚Äù and the World Bank allowed them to make the transition to a more strategic and sustainable approach. The main points of this project were to strengthen the National AIDS agency‚Äôs institutional management and coordination capacity and the second was to finance strategic and innovative HIV/AIDS related prevention. The total cost of the project was $50 million and it ended in 2015.  The Northern Botswana Human Wildlife Coexistence project  Botswana wanted a way to mitigate human and wildlife to prevent interventions in certain rural communities, especially in Northern Botswana. Through this project, the government of Botswana was able to provide job opportunities in wildlife-based tourism to benefit the conservation of wildlife. This project was introduced in 2009 and ended in 2016. The cost of the project was $20.47 million.

It is the only known African-American newspaper ever published there. The newspaper was founded in 1922 by Edward Giles Irvin (1893-1982), the youngest of the ten founding members of the Alpha Kappa Psi fraternity. Irvin had worked for newspapers in various cities before joining the military in World War I. They included the Indianapolis Freeman, Chicago Daily Bulletin, and Gary Sun. Irvin is memorialized in the name of the charitable arm of the Chicago alumni chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi and in the name of an annual Kappa Alpha Psi award. Like many early black papers, The Shining Star placed a strong emphasis on self- improvement, publishing a new word and Bible quotation every week for its readers to memorize. The local news in The Shining Star was dominated by the activities of churches and the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows, of which Irvin was a member. The Shining Star exhorted its readers to support local Anderson businesses and lift up the local community. Its coverage, however, was not limited to Anderson, as it provided a weekly column about nearby Muncie as well.

This claim, which has been contested, is significant, as the only other key exchange approach claiming to offer unconditional security is Quantum key distribution. The KLJN secure key exchange scheme was proposed in 2005 by Laszlo Kish and Granqvist. It has the advantage over quantum key distribution in that it can be performed over a metallic wire with just four resistors, two noise generators, and four voltage measuring devices--- equipment that is low-priced and can be readily manufactured. It has the disadvantage that several attacks against KLJN have been identified which must be defended against. \\"Given that the amount of effort and funding that goes into Quantum Cryptography is substantial (some even mock it as a distraction from the ultimate prize which is quantum computing), it seems to me that the fact that classic thermodynamic resources allow for similar inherent security should give one pause,\\" wrote Henning Dekant, the founder of the Quantum Computing Meetup, in April 2013. http://wavewatching.net/2013/04/01/quantum- cryptography-made-obsolete/ The Cybersecurity Curricula 2017, a joint project of the Association for Computing Machinery, the IEEE Computer Society, the Association for Information Systems, and the International Federation for Information Processing Technical Committee on Information Security Education (IFIP WG 11.8) recommends teaching the KLJN Scheme as part of teaching \\"Advanced concepts\\" in its knowledge unit on cryptography.

Manager Martin Murray was entering his first season in charge, having replaced Terry Eviston during the summer. It was Dundalk's second season in the second tier of Irish football, and their 75th consecutive season in the League of Ireland. Season summary Following the financial difficulties of the mid- and late-1990s, and relegation for the first time at the end of the 1998‚Äì99 season, the club had been taken over by the Dundalk F.C. Co-operative in March 2000, returning it to a supporter- owned, membership-based company model. The previous season there had been expectations of an immediate return to the top-flight, but a poor start left them struggling to catch the leaders and, with a play-off spot seemingly secured, the club became embroiled in a losing battle with the league's hierarchy and Kilkenny City. The row, over Kilkenny playing an improperly registered player, reached the High Court, who sided with Kilkenny thus handing them the play-off spot. Relegation in 1999 had resulted in a large turnover of players ‚Äì 31 different players making League appearances in the 1999‚Äì2000 season alone. With new ownership, and a new manager, there was more of the same. A number of local players had been retained from the previous season's squad, but another ten players were signed before and during the season, so that 21 players in total would make league starts. The previous season's disappointment, and the number of players coming and going, meant that hopes were low going into the new season. The 36-match schedule got under way on 11 August 2000, and Dundalk had a promising start, leading by the end of the month. But a slump in form saw them risk losing touch with fellow pace- setters, Athlone Town, obliging Murray to bring more players in. A victory over Athlone in November, and a five-game winning streak, kept the gap to four points as the other sides fell away. The season was nearly derailed, however, when the 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak lead to an exclusion zone being put in place around County Louth. Many public events were postponed or cancelled, and Dundalk went the whole of March without playing a match. They had beaten Shelbourne in the first round of the Leinster Senior Cup, but the crisis saw the competition ultimately abandoned for the season, and it would be 2010 before it was revived. In the second round of the FAI Cup they had been drawn against non-league Malahide United, and the game had been postponed four times as the crisis wore on. At the fifth attempt, the match was played behind closed doors at a neutral venue, and Dundalk were knocked out in the first match they had played in over five weeks. Two heavy league defeats followed as they struggled to get back up to speed, with home matches having to be played in United Park in Drogheda. But four wins in a row, including a 2‚Äì1 victory over Athlone in the first match played in Oriel Park in over two months, meant Dundalk had won the First Division title (their first), and secured promotion back to the Premier Division for 2001‚Äì02 with a game to spare.

The legend of a pair of statues or dragon head statues that are between the steps of the complex entrance to the tomb of Sunan Giri has been around for hundreds of years. The Dragon Head Statue which is better known as the Naga Giri tells of a magical battle between Sunan Giri and a powerful hermit from the slopes of Mount Semeru, Begawan Minto. The Giri Dragon statue, which is more than 600 years old, was later used as a symbol of the city of Gresik. Every gate at the entrance and exit gate of Gresik city has a statue of a pair of dragons. The symbolism of the dragon's head symbolizes a sacred animal as well as having a deep meaning, strength and morals for spiritual life in the period before Islam entered Nusantara until now.

The upper part of this river crosses the Zec de l'Anse-Saint-Jean. The lower portion of the \\"rivi√®re du Portage\\" Valley is indirectly served by Route 170 which passes on this point on the east bank of the Petit Saguenay River.

Some secondary forest roads serve the rest of the valley, especially in the zec.Open Street Map Forestry is the first economic activity in the sector; recreational tourism activities, second. The surface of the Portage River is usually frozen from the beginning of December to the end of March, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-December to mid- March.  Geography  The main hydrographic slopes near the Portage River are: * North side: Petit Saguenay River, Saguenay River; * East side: Petit Saguenay River, Saint-Athanase River, Saint-√âtienne River; * South side: Dallaire Creek, Petit Saguenay River; * West side: Saint-Jean River. The Portage River is the main tributary of the Petit Saguenay River. It takes its source from the \\"lake √† No√´l\\" (length: ; altitude: ) which is enclosed by mountain cliffs; its mouth is located to the northeast. This headwater body is located between the Mont √† l'Ours (Bear Mount) () and East Mount ), in the southern part of Zec de l'Anse-Saint-Jean. From its source, the mouth of the lake at Christmas, the course of the Portage River descends on according to the following segments: Upper part of the Portage River (segment of ) * to the North, including crossing Piat Lake (length: ; altitude: ) on its full length, to its mouth; * to the North, in particular by crossing the Huet Lake (length: ; altitude: ) on its full length, to its mouth; * northerly forming a loop to the southeast to the outlet (coming from the west) of some lakes in the area of the hamlet \\"La Grande-All√©e\\"; * northeasterly forming a northward loop, collecting the discharge (from the south) of a lake, then crossing a swamp bend of a river corresponding to a creek (coming from the east); * northerly beginning in marsh zone, relatively straight across a long series of rapids in a steep valley, up to a river bend, corresponding to the discharge (coming from southwest) of Rivi√®re Lake; * northeasterly, snaking through a steep valley to a bend in the river; Lower section of the Portage River (segment of ) * east in a steep valley, up to a river bend; * northeasterly in a concealed valley to Petite Poussi√®re Creek (from the west); * northeasterly in a steep valley, collecting the dump (coming from the west) of a lake, then forming a small hook to the north at the end of the segment, until the discharge (from the west) of a lake; * northeasterly, snaking through a valley flared towards its lower part to its mouth. The mouth of the \\"rivi√®re du Portage\\" empties onto the west bank of the Petit Saguenay River.

He is believed to have been the first bowler to use bodyline tactics. Law career Lance Gun was educated at St Peter's College, Adelaide, and the University of Adelaide, where he studied Law. He was formally admitted to the legal profession in April 1925, joining his brother's law firm of Nelligan & Gun, which later became Gun & Gun. Cricket career First match and bodyline bowling Lance Gun was a left-handed batsman. He made his first-class debut at the age of 21 for South Australia in the Sheffield Shield match against New South Wales at the Adelaide Oval in January 1925. On the first day he batted at number seven, going to the wicket when South Australia were 5 for 122, and scoring 136 not out, taking the total to 389 all out. On the second day, when New South Wales batted, Les Gwynne (also making his first-class debut) and Tommy Andrews were building a steady partnership for the third wicket against mediocre bowling when South Australia's captain Vic Richardson asked Gun to bowl. Gun set a bodyline field of seven fieldsmen on the leg side, including five behind square and one at forward short leg. Bowling right-arm fast-medium over the wicket to the right- handed batsmen, he proceeded to bowl short-pitched deliveries at the batsmen or just outside the line of leg stump. Andrews disdained to play strokes against such deliveries, but was surprised by a fuller ball from Gun that bowled him off his pads. Despite not quite knowing how to treat Gun's bowling, Gwynne reached his century, but was later dismissed by Gun, caught after skying the ball. Richardson then took Gun off, and he never bowled again in first-class cricket.David Frith, Bodyline Autopsy, ABC Books, Sydney, 2002, pp. 27‚Äì29. Later career Gun's law career took precedence over his cricket, and his playing career was sporadic and brief. He made one more century for South Australia: against Western Australia in 1925-26 he made 129, putting on 313 in less than four hours for the opening partnership with Arthur Richardson. It was a record opening partnership for South Australia. Other sports Gun played Australian rules football for North Adelaide and Glenelg. He was also a champion contract bridge player. Personal life Gun married Monica Flannagan in Adelaide in October 1928.

She is Emerita Professor in the Department of Politics and International Relations, University of Adelaide. She is an elected Fellow of the Australian Academy of Social Sciences. In 2018, Beasley was named the leading researcher in feminism and women's studies in Australia based on major journal publications in the field. Beasley was the founder and inaugural co-Director of the Fay Gale Centre from 2009 to 2013. In 2014 and 2015, she was Guest Professor, Centre for Gender Studies Karlstad University. In 1994, Beasley was awarded the Stephen Cole the Elder Prize for Teaching. One of Beasley's major intellectual contributions has been to explore possibilities for, and barriers to, dialogue across the sub-fields of gender studies: feminism, masculinity studies and sexuality studies. Beasley has brought attention to the ‚Äòpotential disjunctions‚Äô that arise as a result of the different ‚Äòtheoretical frameworks or paradigms‚Äô that shape the overall agendas of masculinity studies and feminist scholarship. Her work on the use of feminist theory in masculinities research has seen her described as ‚Äòthe most articulate critic on this point [in] arguing that men and masculinities researchers tend to set up ‚Äúawkward couplings‚Äù between structuralist and poststructuralist traditions...‚Äô Beasley is also known in the masculinity studies field through her critical yet supportive engagement with the work of Professor Emerita Raewyn Connell. In the field of feminist scholarship Beasley is known for her work on care. Beasley has shown that care is used as a resistant framework in arguments against individualization that work towards diverse political agendas ‚Äì including some that connect to feminist agendas. While recognizing these connections Beasley also warns of the ethical limits of care as the basis of a resistant politics, highlighting the ‚Äòmoral and asymmetrical relationship [that] is constructed between those needing care and those delivering care, undermining the egalitarian potential of the terminology.‚Äô Beasley has collaborated with Professor Emerita Carol Bacchi and together they have postulated the notion of 'social flesh' as a means to challenge the atomistic individualism that frequently underpins understandings of the human subject in political philosophy.

Background information   Subclass Pentastomida  There are two major groups in the subclass Pentastomida: the Cephalobaenida and Porocephalida. The genus Raillietiella belongs to the group Cephalobaenida, which is more primitive than Porocephalida.Esslinger, J. H. ‚ÄúMorphology of the Egg and Larva of Raillietiella Furcocerca (Pentastomida) from a Colombian Snake (Clelia Clelia).‚Äù The Journal of Parasitology, vol. 54, no. 2, 1968, pp. 411‚Äì416. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3276962. Pentastomids have an indirect life cycle and usually have hosts that are vertebrates. Species under this subclass generally have reptiles as their definitive host. The adult stage of pentastomids are found in the lungs. Once the eggs of the parasite are in the lungs, then they are coughed up, then swallowed back into the host and end in their feces. Divers, Stephen J., and Scott J. Stahl. Mader's Reptile and Amphibian Medicine and Surgery. Elsevier, 2019, pp.281-300.  Development of genus Raillietiella sp.  Once the eggs are fertilized, the formation of an embryo or embryogenesis lasts about 3-4 weeks. Afterwards, the fully developed larva waits for an intermediate host. Then after 4 weeks, it enters the intermediate host. After being in the host for 6-8 weeks, the larvae is now infectious and goes into the definitive host and stays there for 8-10 weeks, which then become adults. After approximately 14-18 weeks, the larvae reaches sexual maturity.Thomas, Gabriele, Stender-Seidel, Susanne, and B√∂ckeler, W. \\"Considerations about the Ontogenesis of Reighardia Sternae in Comparison with Raillietiella Sp.

Dixon had noticed that the population of Hemidactylus turcicus, a Mediterranean gecko, had been increasing quickly all over Houston, Texas. A parasitologist, named John Riley and his team from the University of Dundee, Scotland, had experimented on H. turcicus and found an abundance of a unknown species of pentastomids in the lungs.Riley, John, et al. ‚ÄúRaillietiella Teagueselfi n.

The geckos were then killed with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital and inspected for any type of parasites.  Results  The only location that resulted with geckos infested with R. teagueselfi, were from the Houston Zoological Gardens. The parasites were found in their lungs and only in adults had the parasite. They did not find any correlation with the sex of the parasite, 28.1% of them were males and 32.0% of them were females.  Transmission  Due to the intensity of infection, in this species, they seem to think that this parasite adapted to an insect intermediate host, but since they only found the parasite in this one specific site, they are still unsure on the transmission of it and its factors.  Morphology  Cephalothorax of a female with a cone- shaped mouth and hooks. Females have a genital pore on their anterior ends, as well as pointed hooks. They also have hooks on their posterior ends but they are larger and have rounded tips instead of pointed tips. During the dissection, they examined some eggs within the female, and contained larvae with hooks that were fully developed. Mature males have hooks with blunt tips on their posterior ends. Its body is wider on the upper half of its body and has an annulated abdomen. They also contain hooked copulatory spicules that aid in mating.

The symptoms of Lily Gray Mold include the appearance of water-soaked spots on leaves which appear white and increase in darkness with age, ranging from gray to brown. These spots may cover the entire leaf, complemented with a gray webbing, containing the fungal spores. The leaves will appear wilted and branches may die back. In addition to leaves, petals, stems, and buds may be infected, and this gray webbing will eventually cover the plant, feigning the appearance of gray flowers. Infected buds often rot. Lily Gray Mold disease, if not properly treated, will appear each year with increasing vigor.  Disease cycle  The disease cycle for Botrytis elliptica begins with infection of plants in spring. This may be derived from mycelium in overwintering sclerotia, which produce conidiophores to create conidia, the asexual spores of this fungus. The conidia germinate, often penetrating the young leaf tissue of the lily, although the flowers, buds, or stem may also suffer from infection. This infects cells, which collapse, disintegrate, and rot the tissue. This cycle is polycyclic. The conidiophores spread, producing more conidia to further infect new areas of the plant or spread to new plants. Additionally, B. elliptica reproduces sexually via a heterothallic mating system with two alleles: MAT1-1 and MAT1-2. All ascomycetes studied of B. elliptica contain these genes, which are orthologous to the alpha-domain protein (MAT1-1) and the HMG-domain protein (MAT1-2). These proteins act together as a master regulator the initiation of sexual fruiting body development, which begins when both proteins are expressed in a dikaryotic cell. Apothecia result from this union. These are brown in color, and darken as they mature, and they range between 7‚Äì12 mm in height, with apothecial disks from 3‚Äì4 mm diameter and 0.5-1.0 mm in thickness. The ascospores produced from the apothecia are 23 x 10 Œºm. These ascospores infect Lilium species‚Äô leaves as effectively as the conidia throughout the growing season, although mycelium are the primary inoculants of young lily shoots in the spring. These ascospores may overwinter in the dead leaf debris and infect new foliage in the spring.  Management  As Lilium species are of great horticultural interest in ornamental production, B. elliptica must be prevented and managed to continue production. Plant breeders currently work to determine Botrytis-resistant cultivars of Lilium. The rapid accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, nitrous oxide, and antioxidant activity trigger in the plant's defense response, and long-term, highly concentrated increases contribute to high resistance in these plants. Cultivars displaying high resistance are the Oriental and Oriental x Trumpet hybrid lines, whereas the susceptible cultivars included Asiatic and Trumpet cultivars. Defense responses found in Lilium species are mediated by phytohormones involved in jasmonate signaling, increasing the transcription for defense-related proteins. These proteins include receptor kinases, antioxidant enzymes, polyphenol oxidase, pathogenesis-related proteins, and proteins involved in the phenylpropanoid metabolism. Highly resistant Lilium species cultivars express genes producing these proteins more effectively than in the susceptible cultivars. In addition to breeding for Botrytis-resistant cultivars, steps can be taken to prevent the spread of this mold in the field. Because this mold requires water to spread to other plants, Botrytis can be greatly reduced with good drainage to the soil and caution to avoid overwatering. Additionally, sanitation of plants is extremely important, such as deadheading dying flowers and removing infected leaves. The ascospores on this debris could overwinter and infect the plants in the spring, so it is advised to either bury the debris in a hole at least 12‚Äù deep or, preferably, burn it. Fungicides are rarely needed and are typically used as a prevention method early in the season. Thiophanate-methyl, copper fungicides or, as a weak fungicide, neem oil, can be effectively used in home gardens, although with caution, particularly with new cultivars of Lilium species. These treatments should be applied to selected plants before treating an entire bed, and always using the recommended instructions on the product's label.

World Bank Fiscal Strategy in the Upcoming Years  The World Bank contributes Cabo Verde's growth to the increase in tourism, capital accumulation, poverty reduction, and more shared prosperity. Following these increases, Gross National Income hit $3,630 allowing Cabo Verde to escape the United Nation's list of LDC's. The strategy set in place by the World Bank following this exclusion from the LDC list was described in their fiscal year 2015-2017 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) which focused on enhancing macro-fiscal stability and improving competitiveness within private sector development. Private sector development will mainly include improvements in tourism, fisheries, technology, and agricultural sectors. Some problems that the World Bank outlined for Cabo Verde to account for are government liability and national unemployment. With the population growing and less employment opportunities, the World Bank has a firm stance on closing the significant skill gaps within the employment market and a shift to promoting increased productivity within the country. Along with these issues it has been stated that Cabo Verde needs to address reforms in the investment sector in order to increase their global competitiveness.World Bank. 2014.

The movie served as a commentary on the state of the Philippines in the 1920s. Set in a Visayan town in 1923, the movie shows the resurgence of the ‚Äúpulajanes‚Äù or the revolutionary movement after feelings of frustration of the American regime started to grow: the upper class still ruled society, poverty was still widespread, and injustice in the agrarian system remained prevalent. The film was restored by the ABS-CBN Film Archives through the facilities of Central Digital Lab in Makati City as part of the Centennial Year of the Philippine Cinema.

Release  The film was premiered on December 24, 1977 as part of the 1977 Metro Manila Film Festival.  Digital restoration  The film was restored by the ABS-CBN Film Restoration and Central Digital Lab in Makati City, Metro Manila. Reyna Films, the production company owned and operated by Armida's son Carlos Siguion-Reyna and his wife Bibeth Orteza, supplied the 35mm master negative and sound negative of the 1977 film Mga Bilanggong Birhen. The negative was scanned in 4K and digitally restored in 2K resolution. The film took 550 hours of restoration to remove damage from the negative such as mold, film grain, splice marks, instability, flicker and to reconstitute several missing frames. The restored version of the film was premiered at Cinema '76 Film Society in San Juan City, Metro Manila. The film was attended by the film's co-director Romy Suzara, lead actress Alma Moreno, and cinematographer Romy Vitug. Actress Jobelle Salvador, the daughter of Leroy Salvador; producer Bibeth Orteza, daughter-in-law of Armida Siguion-Reyna; and Tess Carvajal, the granddaughter of Monang Carvajal, also attended the film's premiere through representation of the cast and crew who were deceased or unable to attend.  Controversy  The film was left unfinished when Mario O'Hara left the production before the shooting ended. Eventually, Romy Suzara finished the remaining parts of the film. According to the memoir \\"Armida\\" by Monique Villonco, the film was a controversial piece of work because of certain love scenes, as well as the nude scene of one of the lead actresses, and six naked men pushing a bagon. Mario O‚ÄôHara had asked me, ‚ÄúMa-ilulusot mo ba ito sa BRMPT (Board of Review for Motion Pictures and Television)?‚Äù and I told him that for the festival, there will be no problem, as it was agreed upon that selected entries will not go through censorship. I knew this because I was the president of the IMPDAP that year and Fernando Poe Jr. was president of the PMPPA. Both producers‚Äô associations fought for it and Teodoro Valencia, head of the Executive Committee of the MMFF, had agreed. However, after the 10-day festival, the continued exhibition of the movie would be under the jurisdiction of the BRMPT. But I felt confident because the story was not about prurient interest.

He and his wife, Raylene Sturges, were the first Seventh-day Adventist medical missionaries to Nepal in 1957. They founded the Scheer Memorial Hospital in Banepa, which is the only Western hospital in Kavre District and serves half a million people. In 1961, the US Junior Chamber of Commerce named Sturges one of Ten Outstanding Young Americans. Sturges came from a strong tradition of medical missionary work in his family, and his goal was to minister to the needs of the sick and needy disregarding their social or economic position. It was illegal to openly speak and preach Christianity in Nepal at the time, so patients would come into contact with Sturges‚Äô religion through the hospital.  Family, Education, and Early Life  Sturges was born in Congo on October 14, 1929 to medical missionary parents. His father, Dr. J. Hubert Sturges had a medical practice for the Seventh-Day Adventist Church in Congo. He had an older brother, Dr. Hubert F. Sturges who opened a missionary practice in Ethiopia and a younger brother, Dr. Keith W. Sturges who eventually took over the Scheer Memorial Hospital. His sister, Elizabeth Taylor was also a medical missionary in Kenya. Sturges grew up in California where he and his brothers were taught manual work, such as carpentry and painting. Sturges later wrote that education was a priority in his family and that mission work was his goal from childhood. He received a B.A. degree from Pacific Union College, where he was the student body president. Later, he enrolled at Loma Linda University Medical School as a medical student.  Volleyball  Sturges played for the 1955 Loma Linda university volleyball team that went on to win second place at the national championship. It was the only organized sports program the university ever had. After beating big-name universities in the Los Angeles area and qualifying for the National Tournament, his team came within 2 points of winning the national championship against Florida State University. Sturges was named to the 1955 All-American team for the Collegiate Division.  Medical Mission   Banepa Practice  Two years after graduating from medical school, Sturges arrived in Nepal with his two children and wife, Raylene Sturges in 1957. The Seventh Day Adventist Church supported their mission, and Sturges later wrote in his autobiography that his ‚Äúmotivation to enter mission service centered chiefly in the desire to witness in a practical way to the love of Christ for all.‚Äù Sturges originally planned to open a practice in Kathmandu, but didn‚Äôt want to threaten the United Medical Mission already serving there, so he looked 16 miles east to Banepa. Back then, Banepa was a district center of nearly a 1/4 million people without regular service of a doctor. It was the hub of three trade routes converging on the Valley of Seven Cities, also known as the Kathmandu Valley. When he passed through the city, headsman and 10,000 of local tribesman staged a demonstration for Sturges to choose the city for his practice. The first clinic was opened in a run-down second-floor rented room. Problems plagued the practice, such as the shortage of medicine supply and reluctance of people to come in. Sturges hired more staff and eventually started treating up to 100 patients daily. His wife often helped out and filled in for Sturges when he wasn‚Äôt around.  Scheer Memorial Hospital  Scheer Memorial Hospital in Banepa, Nepal Through the alumni network at Loma Linda University, Sturges contacted Clifford C. Scheer, a construction consultant in New Jersey who was thinking about constructing a memorial for his recently deceased parents. Scheer donated $25,000 for the creation of the Carolyn and Charles J. Scheer Memorial Hospital of Seventh-Day Adventists. Sturges and community members built the hospital themselves over one and a half years. It was officially opened and dedicated in a ceremony on May 18, 1959, which was attended by former Prime Minister BP Koirala, the Minister of Health, and 3,000 townsmen. The hospital, originally a 20-bed facility serving 100 patients daily, has now evolved into a three-story, 150-bed facility. It has also since established the Scheer Memorial Adventists Hospital Medical Institute, College of Nursing where students can earn a B. Sc. Nursing degree and get clinical practice. Because of the abundance of patients, Sturges also opened mobile clinics in Panauti and Dapcha Chhaatrebangh on different days of the week.  Problems Encountered  Sturges treated a range of diseases, including cholera, tuberculosis, elephantiasis, malaria, typhoid, and smallpox. In addition to the lack of electricity and modern tools, Sturges faced wide-spread taboos in the village. such as how male physicians couldn‚Äôt examine women. A local pressed charges against Sturges and the hospital, insinuating that the hospital blocked a nearby holy water source, destroyed a path connecting Banepa to Chandeswori, overcharged for services, preached the Christian religion openly, and that Sturges was guilty of malpractice. The village people, however, rebuked his charges and laughed him out of court.  Legacy  In 1961, Sturges was named one of America‚Äôs Outstanding Young Men by the US Junior Chamber of Commerce. The ceremony was broadcast on national television on January 20, 1961, and Sturges appeared on the Ed Sullivan show, the Today show, and met President Richard Nixon. He was also featured in Life Magazine‚Äôs September 14, 1962 special issue of ‚Äú100 Outstanding Members of the Take-Over Generation.\\" Sturges received the American Academy of Achievement Golden Plate Award in 1965 and the Pacific Union College Honored Alumnus Award in 2016.  Personal life  Sturges had four children with Raylene Sturges. His fourth child, Cheri, was delivered in a station wagon on the way to Kathmandu in 1960. Sturges and his wife were very involved in the Seventh Day Adventist Church. Sturges contributed to their quarterly journal, writing a piece titled ‚ÄúEllen White‚Äôs Authority and the Church‚Äù in the summer 1972 issue. Upon returning to the United States, Sturges was an instructor in psychiatry at the University of Cincinnati before retiring in Portland, Oregon. During retirement, he was affiliated with the Adventist Medical Center-Portland, and Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center. Sturges died on July 12, 2019 in Portland, Oregon.

They were buried in their father's tomb, which was discovered by Howard Carter in 1922. The mummy referred to as 317a is of a girl who was born prematurely at 5‚Äì6 months gestation, and mummy 317b is that of a girl born at or near full- term. No names have been preserved for these children. These princesses represent the final generation of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Discovery and description The mummies were found in a plain wooden box in the north- eastern corner of the Treasury. The lid had been removed in antiquity by robbers. The anthropoid coffins were placed side by side, head to toe. Chips had been taken off the foot of the coffin of 317b to fit it into the box. Both mummies were contained within two nested wooden coffins: the outer coffin was covered in black resin, with gilded bands that name the deceased only as 'the Osiris'; the inner coffins were covered in gold foil. Bands of linen with mud seals of the jackal over nine bound captives sealed the outer coffins. The lid of the outer coffin was attached to the base by eight tenons. 317a Carter unwrapped this mummy in 1925. The head was covered by a gilded death mask that was much too big. The linen wrappings were secured by five transverse bands and two triple longitudinal bands over the front, back, and sides. The wrappings were in thickness, with pads over the chest, legs, and feet. During the 1932 autopsy by Douglas Derry, the mummy was found to be long. The skin was noted as being very brittle and greyish in colour but overall was found to be in good condition. Derry concluded the mummy was likely female and estimated the age to be five months gestation. No sign of an abdominal incision was found. The hands were placed on the front of the thighs. The mummy lacked eyebrows and eyelashes, presumably due to its early gestational age, but light-coloured silky hairs (lanugo) were present on the head. The eyelids were slightly open. The remains of the umbilical cord was preserved to a length of . CT-scanning was conducted as part of the Egyptian Mummy Project in July 2008. The mummy was found to be in very poor condition, which meant the sex could not be determined. A gestational age of 24.7 weeks (5-6 months) was inferred from the length of the humerus. The cranium was found to be filled with high and low density contents which may represent brain tissue or embalming material. The torso was also filled with high and low density contents which are likely embalming packs. No deformities were noted, nor could cause of death be determined. 317b This mummy lacked a mask, though its intended mask is likely the one found earlier in Tutankhamun's embalming cache, KV54. The length of the wrapped mummy was and the length of the body itself was . The manner of wrapping was very similar to the smaller mummy - two triple longitudinal bands and four transverse bands around the head, neck, abdomen, and ankles - on top of a shroud. Below the shroud were various layers of pads and bandaging on the feet, legs, abdomen, and chest to provide shape. The mummy was noted as not being as well preserved as the smaller mummy. It was found to be female and estimated to be seven months gestation. The skin was the same greyish colour and brittle condition as the younger mummy. Fine hair remained on the back of the head, and eyelashes and eyebrows were present. The eyes were wide open, containing only the shrunken eyeball. The hands were placed palm down beside the thighs. The interior of the cranium was examined through the fontanelle and found to be filled with linen which had been inserted through the right nostril. The umbilical cord was not preserved but the navel was not retracted indicating that the umbilical cord had been cut off rather than drying off naturally. An incision long was made parallel to the inguinal ligament and sealed with resin. The body cavity was stuffed with linen. The mummy was next examined in 1978 using x-rays and was found to have been damaged over the intervening years, with the skull crushed, and ribs broken. The age was estimated to be thirty five weeks gestation to full term, and she was diagnosed with Sprengel's deformity, spina bifida, and scoliosis. Serological analysis was also conducted and determined that this mummy had an O blood group. A later re-examination of the x-rays suggested that the child may have been as young as 31 weeks based on the degree of ossification. It has also been suggested that the two were twins who suffered from twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome resulting in one twin who was large for its gestational age and one who was much smaller. It has not been conclusively proven or disproven if this in fact the case but the possibility is considered remote. CT-scanning was also conducted on this mummy in July 2008 as part of the Egyptian Mummy Project. It was found to be better preserved than 317a and so could be examined more thoroughly. The mummy was confirmed to be female based on the external genitalia and the sub-pubic angle. The age at death was estimated at 36.78 weeks. The diagnosis of Sprengel's deformity was rejected. The left scapula is higher than the right but this is due to the left scapula and clavicle being entirely separated from the body and rotating upwards. Both scapulae and clavicles were of normal and comparable dimensions. The spine was found to be in poor condition and fractured postmortem with fragments missing; this gave the appearance of a deformed spine with neural tube defects but no anomalies were found. It is possible that damage caused by lack of preservation in the modern age has caused spinal damage due to spina bifida to be indistinguishable from postmortem damage. Spina bifida, along with other neural tube conditions, can be passed down genetically, and Tutankhamun had a partially cleft hard palate and a clubfoot, both of which can be related to spina bifida. The female mummy referred to as KV21A, possibly the mother of the two children (discussed in more detail below), also had clubfeet on both sides. A child with spina bifida born in Ancient Egypt might have survived to term, but could not have survived past early infancy, as lifesaving surgery was not available. This may explain this child's survival to full-term, followed by death as a newborn. Mild thoracic scoliosis was also present, but was this was determined to be postural. Evidence of subcutaneous padding was found in the legs. This was used to restore a life-like appearance but resulted in the left thigh being larger than the right. Parentage DNA analysis was conducted as part of the Tutankhamun Family Project and although only partial matches were obtained, it was enough to conclude that both mummies were the children of Tutankhamun. Only a partial DNA profile was able to be obtained from the KV21A mummy, but it suggests that she was the mother of the two children. However, the results were not statistically significant enough to be confirmed.

They are native to both North and South America where they are widespread. Crocanthemum are herbaceous perennials or subshrubs with alternate leaves. With the exception of species in California, they generally produce two types of flowers: showy, yellow chasmogamous (cross-pollinated) produced earlier in the growing season, followed by cleistogamous (self-pollinated) flowers that are smaller and lack petals. All species of Crocanthemum are fire tolerant and are found in open habitats. Although the genus was first named in 1836 to encompass New World species of Helianthemum, it generally went unrecognized by taxonomists and its species were included in a broad concept of Helianthemum throughout much of the 1800s and 1900s. However, phylogenetic studies in 2004 and 2009 indicated that the New World species of Helianthemum were more closely related to Hudsonia than Old World Helianthemum.

E. Warren House is a historic house located at 196 Montgomery Street in Newburgh, New York. It is a focal point of the Montgomery‚ÄîGrand‚ÄîLiberty Streets Historic District, one of several houses in the area built by Calvert Vaux. A historical marker for Vaux's friend and partner Andrew Jackson Downing is located outside the house.  Description and history  Back side of the house, showing the descent and enclosed veranda  Ownership  The house was built in 1854 for William Edward Warren (1817‚Äî1877), who served as deputy comptroller of New York City and treasurer of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. Warren began his career as a clerk and bookkeeper, working for David Crawford. Succeeding the Warrens, the Coldwell family owned the house, themselves equally affluent. The son of an English immigrant who arrived in New York in 1841, Thomas Coldwell began as an apprentice, learning to grind files. After pro-typing a machine for felt, Coldwell worked on tools for a new lawn mower machine company, H. N. Swift, inspiring Coldwell to create his own lawn mower design. In 1870, he and two partners, George L. Chadborn and Lewis M. Smith, formed Chadborn & Coldwell Manufacturing Co. Descendants of Coldwell maintained the house in the early 20th century. In 1953, he Hodge family purchased it for use as a funeral home. They were handed down several of Warren's belongings, including his silver-clasped Bible. In 2007, the Hodges attempted to sell the house for $1,000,000, garnering much attention from the media. In his book Villas and Cottages (1857), Vaux lists the design as No. 16, \\"A Picturesque Symmetrical House\\".  Exterior  Aware of the land plot's geography, Vaux ensured the house embraced the steep, river-facing hill that backs it. While the recessed porch and double entrance gates are placed level with Montgomery Street, the back veranda sits on brick supports. The roof features cresting, and above the recessed porch and double doors is a small balcony. Vaux had plans for the grounds, which included hillside paths through fruit trees and shrubs at his recommendation. In the present, a small garden and parking spaces occupy where he specified a yard should exist. From Water Street below, the hill can be seen as descending into overgrowth. = Bargeboards = Perhaps the house's most prominent detail is its extravagant and slightly whimsical bargeboards, which define its Gothic Revival heritage. It is because of this feature that the house is sometimes colloquially described as a gingerbread house. The bargeboard of each gable features an alternating pattern of quatrefoil piercings, with applied florals of the same design. The bottom half is curvilinear, pierced with trefoils and applied moulding. Two dormer windows on the front side have a bargeboard of fleur de leis and dot piercings with applied circles. On the sides and back of the house, four dormer windows carry the same curvilinear shape but only the fleur de leis piercings remain. Although the house was originally stuccoed, it was sandblasted to reveal plain brick. A house painter was hired by the Hodges who chose colors inspired by Frederic Church's Olana. The bargeboard shapes were painted maroon and pale orange, the tin awnings an alternating dark and light green. One of the first floor parlors  Interior  The entrance hall is 12' square, leading into four areas: the staircase, two parlors and a study. The staircase was planned to contain a small apartment behind it, but the room was used by Warren as a private office instead. Two parlors directly in front of the visitor are entered through sliding wooden doors, a panel between them with space for a picture. At the back of the first floor is a veranda, now enclosed, which Vaux intended to be used frequently during the warmer months. The upper floor was originally used as a balcony, and depicted as such in illustrations. The second floor, or chamber floor, has four bedrooms and a bathroom. Period plumbing, sinks and a bathtub are still intact. Below the first floor, the dining room and kitchen connect, with an alcove bay window in the former.

He improved a number of mughams and created new versions of them. For instance, he fused \\"Shahnaz\\" with \\"Kurdi\\" yielding \\"Kurdi-Shahnaz\\". According to Jabbar Garyaghdioglu, Haji Husu is also the creator of the \\"Gatar\\" mugham accompanied by Sadigjan. The last years of Haji Husu's life were not so successful. After returning from Arabia, he was forced to recite the call to prayer at Govhar Agha Mosque in Shusha under pressure from mullahs. Haji Husu died in 1898 in Ashgabat.

This fort was an important fort in Kolhapur district as a watch over for the trade route from Pune to coastal ports. The fort is surrounded by thick forest and hill slopes. History The Kurdugad Fort is also known as Vishramgad Fort. It was named after the goddess Krudai Devi whose temple is constructed at the base of the fort. The fort was constructed during the reign of Shivaji with the assistance of Sardar Baji Pasalkar. The Peshawas were in control of the Kurdugad Fort but it lost its importance once the British rule had begun. The fort was later brought in light by Dattoba Pasalkar, a descendant of Baji Pasalkar. How to reach The nearest town is Kolad which is 125 km from Mumbai. The base village of the fort is Jite which is 25 km from the taluka place Mangaon. The fort can also be trekked from Dhamanwal village. It takes about 2 hours to reach the fort from the base village. The route is very safe and passes through dense jungle. It takes about one and a half hours to reach the tribal Katkari village called Pethwadi. From Pethwadi it is a steep climb of half an hour to reach the entrance gate of the fort. There is no water at the fort so, the night stay on the fort can not be made. The villagers from Pethwadi and Jite make night stay and food arrangements at reasonable cost. Places to see There is one dilapidated Kurdai devi temple in the village Pethwadi. There are two pinnacles on the fort. There are two water cisterns on the fort which retain water even during dry summer season. The best time to visit the fort is from November to February.

Cy Schneider (1980‚Äì1984) In 1980, Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment Network hired Schneider to be the president of the then-new Nickelodeon network. Despite introducing popular programs such as You Can't Do That on Television to the lineup in 1981, Nickelodeon operated at a loss of $10 million dollars, and at one point had the lowest number of viewers compared to other cable channels by 1984. In 1983, Bob Pittman was made head of MTV Networks and Schneider was not comfortable with his \\"idiotic\\" approach to \\"home-based\\" television. As a result, Schneider left the network in early 1984. Geraldine Laybourne (1984-1996) In 1980, Laybourne was hired as a program manager at Nickelodeon, a year-old network, where she initiated the focus-group approach to programming. Laybourne was one of the first people to focus on television programming for kids. She spent 15 years at Nickelodeon, taking over the management of the network, and started accepting advertising for the network, in 1984. Laybourne and her team were responsible for creating and building the Nickelodeon brand, launching Nick at Nite and expanding the network by establishing it in other countries, developing theme parks and creating Nickelodeon magazine, movie, toy and publishing divisions. Under her leadership, Nickelodeon became the top-rated 24-hour cable programming service and won Emmy Awards, Peabody Awards, CableACE Awards and Parents' Choice Awards. The network had a 40% profit margin and explosive growth every year. Laybourne built Nickelodeon into the first global television network to profit from selling advertising targeted towards children. Her programming approach, which made a point of talking to children as equals, built the tiny cable network, which had only five employees in 1980, into an $8 billion business. Herb Scannell (1996-2006) In February 1996, he was named President of Nickelodeon and TV Land, succeeding Geraldine Laybourne. Under his leadership, Nickelodeon (which, under his watch, included such animated series as SpongeBob SquarePants, Danny Phantom, The Fairly OddParents, Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Angry Beavers, Catscratch, and Hey Arnold!) and TV Land became the highest rated cable networks launched within the past seven years. Nickelodeon also expanded to other areas such as live theatrical shows, magazines and feature films. He was also responsible for launching Dora the Explorer, The Brothers Garcia (which is based on Los Garcia, a show he used to watch in Puerto Rico) and Taina.Corporate Bio On June 2003, MTV Chairman Tom Freston named Scannell as president of Nickelodeon Networks and vice chairman of MTV Networks. He played a lead role in the overall management of the entire company. On January 4, 2006, Scannell resigned from his position with MTV/Nickelodeon, and was replaced by Cyma Zarghami. Cyma Zarghami (2006-2018) Zarghami joined Nickelodeon as a scheduling clerk in 1985. She moved up through the programming department and became the channel's general manager in 1996, overseeing programming, scheduling, acquisitions, marketing, and day-to-day management of the network. Zarghami was promoted to general manager and executive vice-president in 1997. In 2004, the position of president of Nickelodeon Television was created for Zarghami, where she oversaw production and development for the network, along with marketing, programming and creativity. After the resignation of Herb Scannell on January 5, 2006, Zarghami became president of the newly formed Kids & Family Group, which included Nickelodeon, Nick@Nite, Nick Jr., TeenNick, Nicktoons, TV Land, CMT, and CMT Pure Country. On June 4, 2018, Zarghami resigned as president of Nickelodeon and retired, after being with the network for 33 years. Brian Robbins (2018-present) On October 1, 2018, Brian Robbins left his position as the president of Paramount Players after Viacom tapped him to be the president of Nickelodeon, ending his 16‚Äìmonth run at the studio.

The impulse vector can be applied for both undamped and underdamped systems, and for both positive and negative impulses in a unified way. The impulse vector makes it easy to obtain impulse time and magnitude of the input shaper graphically. A vector concept for an input shaper was first introduced by W. Singhose for undamped systems with positive impulses, and an impulse vector was first introduced by C.-G. Kang to generalize Singhose idea to underdamped systems with positive and negative impulses.  Definition  Impulse functions A_i \\\\delta (t-t_i) and corresponding impulse vectors \\\\mathbf{I}_i. (a) For a positive impulse function (A_i > 0), the initial point of the impulse vector is located at the origin. (b) For a negative impulse function (A_i < 0), the terminal point of the impulse vector is located at the origin. For a vibratory second-order system \\\\omega_n^2 /(s^2 + 2 \\\\zeta \\\\omega_n + \\\\omega_n^2 ) with undamped natural frequency \\\\omega_n and damping ratio \\\\zeta, the magnitude I_i and angle \\\\theta_i of an impulse vector \\\\mathbf{I}_i corresponding to an impulse function A_i \\\\delta (t-t_i), i = 1,2,...,n is defined in a 2-dimensional polar coordinate system as ::I_i = A_i e^{\\\\zeta \\\\omega_n t_i } ::\\\\theta_i = \\\\omega_d t_i where A_i implies the magnitude of an impulse function, t_i implies the time location of the impulse function, and \\\\omega_d implies damped natural frequency \\\\omega_n \\\\sqrt{1-\\\\zeta^2}. For a positive impulse function with A_i > 0, the initial point of the impulse vector is located at the origin of the polar coordinate system, while for a negative impulse function with A_i < 0, the terminal point of the impulse vector is located at the origin. ‚ñ° In this definition, the magnitude I_i is the product of A_i and a scaling factor for damping during time interval t_i, which represents the magnitude A_i before being damped; the angle \\\\theta_i is the product of the impulse time and damped natural frequency. \\\\delta(t-t_i) represents the Dirac delta function with impulse time at t=t_i. Note that an impulse function is a purely mathematical quantity, while the impulse vector includes a physical quantity (that is, \\\\omega_n and \\\\zeta of a second-order system) as well as a mathematical impulse function. Representing more than two impulse vectors in the same polar coordinate system makes an impulse vector diagram. The impulse vector diagram is a graphical representation of an impulse sequence. Two impulse vectors and their corresponding impulse responses for a second-order system. (a) Two impulse vectors \\\\mathbf{I}_{1}, \\\\mathbf{I}_{2} with the same magnitude and 180 deg angle difference, with one pointing to the origin and the other pointing to the outside, are regarded as the same vector for vector addition and subtraction. (b) Two impulse responses corresponding to two impulse vectors are exactly same after the final impulse time t_2 Consider two impulse vectors \\\\mathbf{I}_1 and \\\\mathbf{I}_2 in the figure on the right-hand side, in which \\\\mathbf{I}_1 is an impulse vector with magnitude I_1 (>0) and angle \\\\theta_1 corresponding to a positive impulse with A_1 > 0, and \\\\mathbf{I}_2 is an impulse vector with magnitude I_2 = -I_1 and angle \\\\theta_2 = \\\\pi + \\\\theta_1 corresponding to a negative impulse with A_2 < 0. Since the two time-responses corresponding to \\\\mathbf{I}_1 and \\\\mathbf{I}_2 are exactly same after the final impulse time t_2 as shown in the figure, the two impulse vectors \\\\mathbf{I}_1 and \\\\mathbf{I}_2 can be regarded as the same vector for vector addition and subtraction. Impulse vectors satisfy the commutative and associative laws, as well as the distributive law for scalar multiplication. The magnitude of the impulse vector determines the magnitude of the impulse, and the angle of the impulse vector determines the time location of the impulse. One rotation, 2 \\\\pi angle, on an impulse vector diagram corresponds to one (damped) period of the corresponding impulse response. If it is an undamped system (\\\\zeta = 0), the magnitude and angle of the impulse vector become I_i = A_i and \\\\theta_i = \\\\omega_n t_i.  Properties   Property 1: Resultant of two impulse vectors.  Two representations \\\\mathbf{I}_{R1}, \\\\mathbf{I}_{R2} of the resultant of two impulse vectors \\\\mathbf{I}_{1}, \\\\mathbf{I}_{2} and the corresponding impulse responses. The impulse response of a second-order system corresponding to the resultant of two impulse vectors is same as the time response of the system with a two-impulse input corresponding to two impulse vectors after the final impulse time regardless of whether the system is undamped or underdamped.  Property 2: Zero resultant of impulse vectors.  Cancelling impulse vector \\\\mathbf{I}_3 causes no residual vibration after the final impulse time t_3 when the impulse sequence A_1 \\\\delta (t) + A_2 \\\\delta (t-t_2) + A_3 \\\\delta (t-t_3) is applied to an undamped or underdamped second-order system because \\\\mathbf{I}_1 + \\\\mathbf{I}_2 + \\\\mathbf{I}_3 = \\\\mathbf{0}. If the resultant of impulse vectors is zero, the time response of a second-order system for the input of the impulse sequence corresponding to the impulse vectors becomes zero also after the final impulse time regardless of whether the system is undamped or underdamped. Consider an underdamped second-order system with the transfer function 4 \\\\pi^2 / (s^2 + 0.4 \\\\pi s + 4 \\\\pi^2 ). This system has \\\\omega_n = 2 \\\\pi and \\\\zeta = 0.1. For given impulse vectors \\\\mathbf{I}_1 and \\\\mathbf{I}_2 as shown in the figure, the resultant can be represented in two ways, \\\\mathbf{I}_{R1} and \\\\mathbf{I}_{R2}, in which \\\\mathbf{I}_{R1} corresponds to a negative impulse with A_{R1} = I_{R1} / e^{\\\\zeta \\\\omega_n t_{R1}} and t_{R1} = \\\\theta_{R1} / \\\\omega_d, and \\\\mathbf{I}_{R2} corresponds to a positive impulse with A_{R2} = I_{R2} / e^{\\\\zeta \\\\omega_n t_{R2}} and t_{R2} = \\\\theta_{R2} / \\\\omega_d. The resultants \\\\mathbf{I}_{R1}, \\\\mathbf{I}_{R2} can be found as follows. ::R_x = I_1 + I_2 \\\\cos \\\\theta_2 , \\\\ \\\\ R_y = I_2 \\\\sin \\\\theta_2, ::I_{R1} = - \\\\sqrt{R_x^2 + R_y^2},\\\\ \\\\ \\\\theta_{R1} = \\\\pi + \\\\tan^{-1} (R_y / R_x) ::I_{R2} = \\\\sqrt{R_x^2 + R_y^2},\\\\ \\\\ \\\\theta_{R2} = \\\\tan^{-1} (R_y / R_x) Note that \\\\- \\\\pi /2 < \\\\tan^{-1} (a) < \\\\pi /2. The impulse responses y_{R1} and y_{R2} corresponding to \\\\mathbf{I}_{R1} and \\\\mathbf{I}_{R2} are exactly same with y_1 + y_2 after each impulse time location as shown in the figure. Now, place an impulse vector \\\\mathbf{I}_3 on the impulse vector diagram to cancel the resultant \\\\mathbf{I}_1 + \\\\mathbf{I}_2 as shown in the figure. The impulse vector \\\\mathbf{I}_3 is given by ::I_3 = \\\\sqrt{R_x^2 + R_y^2},\\\\ \\\\ \\\\theta_3 = \\\\pi + \\\\tan^{-1}(R_y /R_x ). When the impulse sequence corresponding to three impulse vectors \\\\mathbf{I}_1, \\\\mathbf{I}_2 and \\\\mathbf{I}_3 is applied to a second-order system as an input, the resulting time response causes no residual vibration after the final impulse time t_3. Of course, another canceling vector \\\\mathbf{I}^'_3 can exist, which is the impulse vector with the same magnitude as \\\\mathbf{I}_3 but with an opposite arrow direction. However, this canceling vector has a longer impulse time that can be as much as a half period compared to \\\\mathbf{I}_3.  Applications: Design of input shapers using impulse vectors  Impulse vector diagrams for (a) ZV, (b) ZVD, (c) ZVD2, and (d) ZVD3 shapers.  ZVDn shaper  Using impulse vectors, we can redesign known input shapers such as zero vibration (ZV), zero vibration and derivative (ZVD), and ZVDn shapers. The ZV shaper is composed of two impulse vectors, in which the first impulse vector is located at 0¬∞, and the second impulse vector with the same magnitude is located at 180¬∞ for \\\\mathbf{I}_1 + \\\\mathbf{I}_2 = \\\\mathbf{0}. Then from the impulse vector diagram of the ZV shaper on the right-hand side, ::\\\\theta_1 = 0, \\\\ \\\\ \\\\theta_2 = \\\\pi ::I_1 = I_2 = I. Therefore, t_1 = 0, \\\\ \\\\ t_2 = \\\\pi/ \\\\omega_d. Since A_1 + A_2 = 1 (normalization constraint) must be hold, and A_1 = I_1, \\\\ \\\\ A_2 = I_2 / e^{\\\\zeta \\\\omega_n t_2}, ::I_1 + \\\\frac {I_2}{e^{\\\\zeta \\\\omega_n t_2 }} = I + \\\\frac {I}{K} = 1, \\\\quad K=e^{\\\\zeta \\\\pi / \\\\sqrt {1-\\\\zeta^2 }} . Therefoere, I = K/(K+1). Thus, the ZV shaper A_1 \\\\delta (t) + A_2 \\\\delta (t-t_2) is given by :: \\\\begin{bmatrix} t_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_i \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0, & \\\\pi / \\\\omega_d \\\\\\\\\\\\ K/(K+1), & 1/(K+1) \\\\end{bmatrix} . The ZVD shaper is composed of three impulse vectors, in which the first impulse vector is located at 0 rad, the second vector at \\\\pi rad, and the third vector at 2 \\\\pi rad, and the magnitude ratio is I_1 : I_2 : I_3 = 1:2:1. Then \\\\mathbf{I}_1 + \\\\mathbf{I}_2 + \\\\mathbf{I}_3 = \\\\mathbf{0}. From the impulse vector diagram, ::\\\\theta_1 = 0, \\\\ \\\\ \\\\theta_2 = \\\\pi , \\\\ \\\\ \\\\theta_3 = 2 \\\\pi . Therefore, t_1 = 0, \\\\ t_2 = \\\\pi/ \\\\omega_d , \\\\ t_3 = 2 \\\\pi/ \\\\omega_d. Also from the impulse vector diagram, ::I_1 = I_3 = I, \\\\ \\\\ I_2 = 2I. Since A_1 + A_2 + A_3 = 1 must be hold, ::I_1 + \\\\frac {I_2}{e^{\\\\zeta \\\\omega_n t_3}} + \\\\frac {I_3}{e^{\\\\zeta \\\\omega_n t_3}} = I+ \\\\frac{2I}{K}+ \\\\frac{I}{K^2} = 1, \\\\ \\\\ K=e^{\\\\zeta \\\\pi / \\\\sqrt {1-\\\\zeta^2 }} . Therefore, I=K^2 /(K+1)^2. Thus, the ZVD shaper A_1 \\\\delta (t) + A_2 \\\\delta (t-t_2) + A_3 \\\\delta (t- t_3 ) is given by :: \\\\begin{bmatrix} t_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_i \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0, & \\\\pi / \\\\omega_d, & 2 \\\\pi / \\\\omega_d\\\\\\\\\\\\ K^2/(K+1)^2, & 2K/(K+1)^2, & 1/(K+1)^2 \\\\end{bmatrix} . The ZVD2 shaper is composed of four impulse vectors, in which the first impulse vector is located at 0 rad, the second vector at \\\\pi rad, the third vector at 2 \\\\pi rad, and the fourth vector at 3 \\\\pi rad, and the magnitude ratio is I_1 : I_2 : I_3 : I_4 = 1:3:3:1. Then \\\\mathbf{I}_1 + \\\\mathbf{I}_2 + \\\\mathbf{I}_3 + \\\\mathbf{I}_4 = \\\\mathbf{0}. From the impulse vector diagram, ::\\\\theta_1 = 0, \\\\ \\\\ \\\\theta_2 = \\\\pi , \\\\ \\\\ \\\\theta_3 = 2 \\\\pi , \\\\ \\\\ \\\\theta_4 = 3 \\\\pi. Therefore, t_1 = 0, \\\\ \\\\ t_2 = \\\\pi / \\\\omega_d , \\\\ \\\\ t_3 = 2 \\\\pi / \\\\omega_d , \\\\ \\\\ t_4 = 3 \\\\pi / \\\\omega_d. Also, from the impulse vector diagram, ::I_1 = I_4 = I, \\\\ \\\\ I_2 = I_3 = 3I. Since A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4 = 1 must be hold, ::I_1 + \\\\frac {I_2}{e^{\\\\zeta \\\\omega_n t_2}} + \\\\frac {I_3}{e^{\\\\zeta \\\\omega_n t_3}} + \\\\frac {I_4}{e^{\\\\zeta \\\\omega_n t_4}} = I + \\\\frac {3I}{K} + \\\\frac {3I}{K^2} + \\\\frac {I}{K^3} = 1, \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ K=e^{\\\\zeta \\\\pi / \\\\sqrt {1-\\\\zeta^2 }} . Therefore, I = K^3 / (K+1)^3. Thus, the ZVD2 shaper A_1 \\\\delta (t) + A_2 \\\\delta (t-t_2) + A_3 \\\\delta (t-t_3) + A_4 \\\\delta (t-t_4) is given by :: \\\\begin{bmatrix} t_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_i \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0, & \\\\pi / \\\\omega_d, & 2 \\\\pi / \\\\omega_d, & 3 \\\\pi / \\\\omega_d \\\\\\\\\\\\ K^3/(K+1)^3, & 3K^2/(K+1)^3, & 3K/(K+1)^3, & 1/(K+1)^3 \\\\end{bmatrix} . Similarly, the ZVD3 shaper with five impulse vectors can be obtained, in which the first vector is located at 0 rad, the second vector at \\\\pi rad, third vector at 2 \\\\pi rad, the fourth vector at 3 \\\\pi rad, and the fifth vector at 4 \\\\pi rad, and the magnitude ratio is I_1 : I_2 : I_3 : I_4 : I_5 = 1:4:6:4:1. In general, for the ZVDn shaper, i-th impulse vector is located at (i-1) \\\\pi rad, and the magnitude ratio is I_1 : I_2 : I_3 : \\\\cdots : I_{n+2} = \\\\tbinom{n+1}{0} : \\\\tbinom{n+1}{1} : \\\\tbinom{n+1}{2} : \\\\cdots : \\\\tbinom{n+1}{n+1} where \\\\tbinom{m}{k} implies a mathematical combination.  ETM shaper  Impulse vector diagram of (a) an ETM4 shaper, (b) ETM5 shaper, and (c) ETM6 shaper. Now, consider equal shaping-time and magnitudes (ETM) shapers , with the same magnitude of impulse vectors and with the same angle between impulse vectors. The ETMn shaper satisfies the conditions ::\\\\theta_1 = 0, \\\\ \\\\ \\\\theta_2 = \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi}{n-1}, \\\\cdots , \\\\theta_{n-1} = \\\\frac{(n-2)2 \\\\pi}{n-1}\\\\ \\\\ ::I_2 = I_3 = \\\\cdots = I_{n-1} = I_1 + I_n , \\\\ \\\\ I_n = mI_1 \\\\ (m>0) ::\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i = 1. Thus, the resultant of the impulse vectors of the ETMn shaper becomes always zero for all n \\\\ge 2 . One merit of the ETMn shaper is that, unlike the ZVDn or extra insensitive (EI) shapers , the shaping time is always one (damped) period of the time response even if n increases. The ETM4 shaper with four impulse vectors is obtained from the above conditions together with impulse vector definitions as :: \\\\begin{bmatrix} t_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_i \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0, & (2 \\\\pi /3) / \\\\omega_d, & (4 \\\\pi /3) / \\\\omega_d, & 2 \\\\pi / \\\\omega_d \\\\\\\\\\\\ I/(1+m), & I/K^{2/3}, & I/K^{4/3}, & mI/ [(1+m)K^2] \\\\end{bmatrix} . ::I=\\\\frac{(1+m)K^2}{K^2 + (1+m)(K^{4/3} + K^{2/3})+m} , \\\\quad K=e^{\\\\zeta \\\\pi / \\\\sqrt{1-\\\\zeta^2}}. The ETM5 shaper with five impulse vectors is obtained similarly as :: \\\\begin{bmatrix} t_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_i \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0, & ( \\\\pi /2) / \\\\omega_d, & \\\\pi / \\\\omega_d, & (3 \\\\pi /2) / \\\\omega_d , & 2 \\\\pi / \\\\omega_d\\\\\\\\\\\\ I/(1+m), & I/K^{1/2}, & I/K, & I/K^{3/2}, & mI/ [(1+m)K^2] \\\\end{bmatrix} . ::I=\\\\frac{(1+m)K^2}{K^2 + (1+m)(K^{3/2} + K + K^{1/2})+m} ,\\\\quad K=e^{\\\\zeta \\\\pi / \\\\sqrt{1-\\\\zeta^2}}. In the same way, the ETMn shaper with n \\\\ge 6 can be obtained easily. In general, ETM shapers are less sensitive to modeling errors than ZVDn shapers in a large positive error range. Note that the ZVD shaper is an ETM3 shaper with m=1.  NMe shaper  Impulse vector diagram for an NMe shaper with a negative impulse. Moreover, impulse vectors can be applied to design input shapers with negative impulses. Consider a negative equal-magnitude (NMe) shaper , in which the magnitudes of three impulse vectors are I_1 = I (>0), \\\\ I_2 = -I,\\\\ I_3 = I, and the angles are \\\\theta_1 = 0, \\\\ \\\\theta_2 = \\\\pi /3,\\\\ \\\\theta_3 = 2 \\\\pi /3. Then the resultant of three impulse vectors becomes zero, and thus the residual vibration is suppressed. Impulse time t_2, t_3 of the NMe shaper are obtained as t_2 = (\\\\pi /3)/ \\\\omega_d, \\\\ t_3 = (2 \\\\pi /3)/ \\\\omega_d, and impulse magnitudes are obtained easily by solving the simultaneous equations ::A_1 = I, A_2 = -I/e^{\\\\zeta \\\\omega_n t_2}, \\\\ \\\\ A_3 = I/e^{\\\\zeta \\\\omega_n t_3} ::A_1 + A_2 + A_3 = 1. Residual vibration suppression by input shapers. (a) Block diagram of a typical input-shaping control system, and (b) step responses of a vibratory system 4 \\\\pi^2 /(s^2 + 0.4 \\\\pi s + 4 \\\\pi^2 ) with various input shapers when there is no modeling error. The resulting NMe shaper A_1 \\\\delta (t) + A_2 \\\\delta (t-t_2) + A_3 \\\\delta (t-t_3) is :: \\\\begin{bmatrix} t_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_i \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0, & ( \\\\pi /3) / \\\\omega_d, & (2 \\\\pi /3)/ \\\\omega_d \\\\\\\\\\\\ I, & -I/K^{1/3}, & I/K^{2/3} \\\\end{bmatrix} . ::I = K/(K-K^{2/3} + K^{1/3}), \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ K=e^{\\\\zeta \\\\pi / \\\\sqrt{1- \\\\zeta^2}}. The NMe shaper has faster rise time than the ZVD shaper, but it is more sensitive to modeling error than the ZVD shaper. Note that the NMe shaper is the same with the UM shaper if the system is undamped (\\\\zeta = 0). Refer to the reference for sensitivity curves of the above input shapers, which represent the robustness to modeling errors.

This article describes the relationship between Morocco and the IMF since it joined in 1958. It also highlights some achievements and planned projects. History and current standing  Morocco joined the IMF on April 15, 1958. Morocco's Special Drawing Rights (SDR) currently stand at 542.36 million. Their quota holdings are currently worth 894 SDR million. 85.53% of those are part of the IMF's Holdings of Currency or in other words 747.13 SDR millions while the remaining 16.47% is the Reserve Tranche Position or 147.35 SDR millions. As of December 2019, Morocco and the IMF have had 20 arrangements since the country joined the organisation (IMF, 2019). Nonetheless, the only specific IMF programmes that have ever been put in place in Morocco are the annual Article IV consultations. Moreover, Morocco has no outstanding purchases and loans. Finally, it is in the same constituency as Afghanistan, Algeria, Ghana, Iran, Libya, Pakistan and Tunisia. The executive director of this group is Jafar Mojarrad.  Current and prospective goals and projects   Goals  The main goals of the IMF's engagement with Morocco are centered around increasing economic growth through improving economic governance by among other things making budget processes more transparent and strengthening fiscal institutions. More specifically, the issues that the IMF is concerned with in regards to the Moroccan economy are excessively high unemployment rates in the population, issues stemming from political conflicts in the region and risks linked to fragility of the euro in light of the strong dependency of the dirham on the euro. All an all, like its other North African counterparts, all of these targets are centered around one rationale shared by most which according to Hanieh is to shape such developing countries ‚Äúin the image of neoliberalism, rendering North Africa‚Äôs uprisings within a discourse amenable to the deepening of pro-market policies‚Äù.  Arrangements  The most recent deal between the IMF and Morocco is the Precautionary and Liquidity Line Arrangement. It was approved in December 2018 and concluded in May 13th 2019 for a time period of two years. The arrangement is worth an amount of SDR 2.15 billion. This is worth 240% of the quota currently held by Morocco. The deal works a security line on which Morocco can draw on in times of need. These types of agreements provided by the IMF are more specifically designed ‚Äúin the event of a severe balance of payment crisis caused by deterioration in the international economic situation‚Äù. The conditions of the agreement involve several reforms in various sectors including fiscal and monetary policy that authorities are obliged to implement. According to the report published by the IMF, the Moroccan government has been fairly successful at doing so. A similar agreement had previously been approved between the IMF and Morocco in August 2012 for a value of $6.2 billion.  Achievements  On the one side, economic growth has slightly weakened since 2018. This is mainly due to lower agricultural growth and slow growth in the tertiary sector. The position of Morocco on the international market has also worsened as the current account deficit has grown. On the other, economic health in many other aspects in Morocco has improved fairly well in the past few years. Macroeconomic vulnerabilities have gone down, inflation and public debt is declining while government revenues, FDI and exports in two of the main export sectors of the Moroccan economy, phosphate and automobile, have risen.

Since 1279, Mu'ege was conquered by the Yuan dynasty and became Chiefdom of Shuixi () under the Chinese tusi system. Shuixi was one of the most powerful clans in Southwestern China; Bozhou, Sizhou, Shuidong and Shuixi were called \\"Four Great Native Chiefdom in Guizhou\\" () by Chinese. In 1698, it was fully annexed into the central bureaucratic system of the Qing dynasty. Origin According to Nasu Yi legend, they are descended from Dumuwu, whose three wives bore him six sons. These six sons migrated southwest and created the Wu, Zha, Nuo, Heng, Bu, and Mo clans. During the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, the Heng, Bu, and Mo clans migrated east across the Wumeng Mountain range. The Heng clan divided into two branches. One branch, known as the Wumeng settled along the western slope of the Wumeng Mountain range, extending their control as far west as modern day Zhaotong. The other branch, known as the Chele, moved along the eastern slope of the Wumeng Mountain range and settled to the north of the Chishui River. By the Tang dynasty (618-907), the Chele occupied the area from Xuyong in Sichuan to Bijie in Guizhou. The Bu clan fragmented into four branches. The Bole branch settled in Anshun, the Wusa branch settled in Weining, the Azouchi branch settled in Zhanyi, and the Gukuge branch settled in northeast Yunnan. The Mo clan, descended from Mujiji (), split into three branches. One branch known as the Awangren, led by Wualou, settled in southwest Guizhou and formed the Ziqi Kingdom. Wuake led the second branch, the Ayuxi, to settle near Ma'an Mountain south of Huize. Wuana led the third branch to settle in Hezhang. In the 3rd century AD, Wuana's branch split into the Mangbu branch in Zhenxiong, led by Tuomangbu, and Luodian () in Luogen, led by Tuoazhe. By 300, Luodian covered over much of the Shuixi region. Its ruler, Mowang (), moved the capital to Mugebaizhage (modern Dafang), where he renamed his realm the Mu'ege kingdom. {class=\\"sortable \\" -CCCC;\\" + Nasu Yi kingdoms by the Tang dynasty - !

In 829, the Tang dynasty sought an alliance with the ruler of Mu'ege, who was then a \\"spirit master\\" named Agengawei, against the expanding realm of Nanzhao. According to Tang sources, Mu'ege possessed a formidable cavalry force which could cover great distances in short periods of time. Agengawei agreed to become a vassal of the Tang dynasty but did not present tribute or pay taxes to the Tang. In order to forge an alliance against Nanzhao, the Tang also invested other Yi branches with new titles. In 846, the Tang recognized the Awangren as leaders of the Yushi kingdom and the Bole as the leaders of the Luodian kingdom (). In 847, they recognized the Mangbu as the leaders of the Badedian kingdom. Together, these four kingdoms formed a buffer zone between the Tang and Nanzhao. By the middle of the 9th century, the Mu'ege under the rule of Nazhiduse had expanded south to around modern Guiyang. When the Tang dynasty collapsed in 907, Mu'ege expanded its control throughout central and eastern Guizhou. In 975, Emperor Taizong of Song attempted to convince Pugui () of Mu'ege to acquiesce to Song overlordship. It's not certain what Pugui's response was, but Taizong was not pleased, and soon ordered an attack on Mu'ege. Song Jingyang (Chiefdom of Shuidong) and Long Hantang were authorized to drive the Mu'ege across the Yachi River, which after a year of fighting, they succeeded in doing. In 1042, the Song dynasty allowed Mu'ege to access its neighboring prefectures. In 1044, the Song appointed Mu'ege's ruler Tekkai as regional inspector of Yaozhou. From then on the Mu'ege dynasty was known as the Luo clan and received many titles from the Song court. They participated in the trade of horses in neighboring prefectures. In 1279, Acha of Mu'ege surrendered to the Yuan dynasty, but Wusuonu of the Wumeng clan sabotaged the negotiations, and told the Mongols that Acha would never surrender. In 1282, Yuan forces occupied Mu'ege, but heavy resistance fighting and disease forced them to withdraw the following year. Acha's brother Ali was invested as pacification commissioner. Although the Mongol occupation was brief and direct administration returned to native rulers, the Yuan administration had a profound impact on Mu'ege's government over the course of the next century. When Ming dynasty officials visited the region in 1381, they found an elaborate bureaucratic structure dividing the region into 13 granaries, each governed by a hereditary official called zimo (elder administrator). These granaries were known as Mukua, Fagua, Shuizhu, Jiale, Ajia, Dedu, Longkua, Duoni, Zewo, Yizhu, Xiongsuo, Yude and Liumu. Tusi Chiefdom of Shuixi In 1372, Aicui of Mu'ege surrendered to the Ming dynasty. During the Ming conquest of Yunnan, Ma Hua () was put in charge of Guiyang, around which he built a wall using conscripted laborers from Mu'ege. Ma Hua wanted to eliminate Mu'ege altogether and tried to incite them to rebellion. He brought the regent mother She Xiang before the people of Guiyang, stripped her naked, and whipped her to near death. Instead of attacking Ma Hua, who had laid a trap, Mu'ege sent a messenger reporting his behavior to the Hongwu Emperor. An investigation was carried out which led to a rebuke to Ma Hua and She Xiang's investment as Lady of Virtue and Obedience. In 1413, the province of Guizhou was created with the Mu'ege ruler as its pacification commissioner. Thirty thousand Chinese soldiers were settled in eastern Guizhou. In the 1520s, 50,000 soldiers were settled in central Guizhou. By the 1560s, the Yi people in the region had learned Chinese agricultural techniques and were thoroughly integrated in the Chinese trade network. In 1600, the Chinese population of Guizhou reached three million. Many of them were captured by the Yi people and sold as slaves. Since 1373, each Shuixi (Mu'ege) ruler was granted the title Guizhou Xuanweishi (), as the highest aboriginal governor of Guizhou Province; each Shuidong ruler held the title Guizhou Xuanwei tongzhi (), served as the Mu'ege rulers' assistant. Initially, the official residences of Shuixi and Shuidong rulers were in Guizhou (present day Guiyang) and Shuixi rulers were not allowed to go back to their chiefdom freely. This rule was abolished by the Ming court in 1479, and since then, Shuixi rulers spent most of their life in Shuixi. The power of Shuidong rulers soon expanded rapidly and Shuixi came into prolonged conflict with Shuidong. Shuixi was also in prolonged feuds with the Chiefdom of Bozhou. Shuixi helped Ming China to suppress the Bozhou rebellion in 1600. After the rebellion was put down, Shuixi became the most powerful aboriginal strength in Guizhou Province. Friction between the Chinese and Yi people eventually led to the She-An Rebellion which lasted from 1621 to 1629. The rebellion was led by She Chongming (Â•¢Â¥áÊòé, chief of Yongning) and An Bangyan (ÂÆâÈÇ¶ÂΩ•, the regent of Mu'ege). As a puppet ruler, the young Mu'ege chief An Wei () was forced to join the rebellion. After the rebellion was put down, An Wei was pardoned by Ming court and remained in his position. In 1664, Mu'ege rebelled against Qing China but was quickly put down. The Mu'ege chief An Kun () was executed by Wu Sangui and his chiefdom was annexed by Qing China in the same year. Later, An Kun's son An Shengzu () helped Qing China to suppress the Rebellion of Wu Sangui. In 1683, An Shengzu was appointed the chief of Mu'ege by Qing court, though he had no authority in his chiefdom. An Shengzu died without heir in 1698. In the same year, his chiefdom was fully annexed into the central bureaucratic system of the Qing dynasty.

Betty Cohen (1992‚Äì2001) Cohen became president of Cartoon Network from 1992 to 2001. Under her leadership, the network became a global phenomenon with asset value of nearly $3 billion. Cohen stepped down from her post on June 18, 2001, stating \\"I was afraid I would die the queen of cartoons.\\" She was succeeded by Jim Samples. Under Cohen's watch, network brands such as Toonami, the Cartoon Cartoons, Cartoon Cartoon Fridays, and Cartoon Orbit were introduced, as well as original series such as Space Ghost Coast to Coast, What a Cartoon!, Dexter's Laboratory, Johnny Bravo, Cow and Chicken, The Powerpuff Girls, Ed, Edd n Eddy, and Courage the Cowardly Dog. Dexter's Laboratory, in particular, was one of her favorite animated shows. Jim Samples (2001‚Äì2007) 276x276px On August 22, 2001, Samples was promoted to Executive Vice President and General Manager of Cartoon Network Worldwide, replacing founder and original president Betty Cohen. Under Samples's leadership, the network included successful original series such as Samurai Jack, Codename: Kids Next Door, The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy, Star Wars: Clone Wars, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, Camp Lazlo, Ben 10, and Class of 3000. He is also credited with the rollout and launch of Adult Swim, the leading late-night network for young men in the United States, and joined forces with 20th Century Fox to put Family Guy back into production as the anchor for the Adult Swim line-up. Under Samples's leadership, Cartoon Network also somewhat controversially began airing live-action \\"cartoon-inspired\\" movies in 2005, such as The Goonies and Who Framed Roger Rabbit; this move was made in response to CN's slumping ratings due to competing live-action shows on Nickelodeon and Disney Channel. In 2006, the network produced their first live-action original movie, Re-Animated, a collaboration between live-action and animation. When asked about the project, Samples stated \\"We think when it's done the 'Cartoon Network' way, kids will enjoy seeing animation and the real world collide.\\"http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2006/03/09/cartoon- network-goes-live-with-re- animated-20773/20060309cartoon01/#zKbbZxHq3x87oAoX.99 While Cartoon Network intended to produce future shows that blend live-action with animation as well as \\"cartoony\\" live-action shows, Samples maintained \\"we're predominately an animated network and that's not changing anytime soon.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070514001546/http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6394544.html Samples resigned from his post on February 9, 2007, following a bomb scare in Boston caused by packages left around the city that were part of an outdoor marketing campaign promoting the Adult Swim series Aqua Teen Hunger Force. On May 2, Stuart Snyder was named Samples' successor. On September 14, the network's look was revamped, with bumpers and station IDs themed to The Hives song \\"Fall is Just Something That Grown-Ups Invented.\\" 2007 saw the debut of Out of Jimmy's Head, a spin-off of the movie Re-Animated, and the first live- action Cartoon Network series. 2007 also saw the debut of the series Chowder. In late 2007, The network began broadcasting programs from Canadian channels such as YTV and Teletoon, including George of the Jungle, 6teen, Storm Hawks, League of Super Evil, Chaotic, Bakugan Battle Brawlers, Stoked, and the Total Drama series. Each October from 2007 to 2009, Cartoon Network also re-ran 40 episodes of the former Fox Kids series Goosebumps.

Samples made the decision \\"in recognition of the gravity of the situation that occurred under my watch\\", and with the \\"hope that my decision allows us to put this chapter behind us and get back to our mission of delivering unrivaled original animated entertainment for consumers of all ages\\". Following Samples's resignation, Stuart Snyder was named his successor. In June 2009, Cartoon Network introduced a block of live-action reality shows called \\"CN Real\\", featuring programs such as The Othersiders, Survive This, BrainRush, Destroy Build Destroy, Dude, What Would Happen and Bobb'e Says. The network also aired some limited sports programming, including basketball recaps and Slamball games, during commercial breaks. The lineup was universally panned for being live-action shows on a channel dedicated to cartoons, competing against Nickelodeon & Disney Channel. That year, it also started airing live-action feature films from Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema.

The form of yoga practised in the Western world was influenced by Pehr Henrik Ling's system of gymnastics. Sweden is home, too, to Europe's first yoga school, the Goswami Yoga Institute in Stockholm. History Pehr Henrik Ling's gymnastics system shaped the development of modern yoga as exercise. The Swedish gymnastics pioneer Pehr Henrik Ling (1776‚Äì1839) devised a system of gymnastics which, according to yoga scholar Mark Singleton, shaped the development of modern yoga as exercise in the Western world. Yoga arrived in Sweden in 1949 when the Indian yogi Shyam Sundar Goswami (1891-1978) visited the country for the ' gymnastic competition named for Ling. Goswami founded Stockholm's Goswami Yoga Institute the same year: it was the first yoga school in Europe, and Goswami taught there for the rest of his life. His followers continue to run the institute. In 1946, the Austrian Walther Eidlitz (1892-1976), known as VƒÅmana DƒÅsa, moved to Sweden and taught Bhakti Yoga there for the rest of his life. In the early 1960s Bert Yoga Jonson (also called Bert Yogson) opened his yoga studio in Malm√∂, also teaching in Gothenburg and writing 15 books on yoga. Swami Janakananda founded the Kriya Yoga centre in Sm√•land in 1972. In 1972, Swami Janakananda founded the Kriya Yoga centre H√•√• Kursg√•rd in the southern province of Sm√•land. In 1976, Stockholm's Skandinavisk Yoga och Meditationsskola (\\"Scandinavian Yoga and Meditation School\\") was founded. It claims to be Stockholm's oldest school of yoga as exercise, and uses H√•√• Kursg√•rd as its retreat centre. H√•√• Kursg√•rd is described on another page on the same website. Rachel Br√•th√©n (1988- ), known as \\"Yoga Girl\\", is a Swedish yoga teacher whose 2015 book, also called Yoga Girl, became a New York Times best-seller and popularised the line \\"Yoga every damn day\\". One of the pioneers of Paddleboard Yoga, she lives and teaches yoga in the island of Aruba in the Caribbean Sea. Practice Interest in yoga has increased rapidly in the 21st century. Around 5% of Swedes state that they practice yoga, though few have read the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. In 2017, yoga was Sweden's 8th most popular fitness method, and was the primary fitness activity for 12% of its women and 2% of its men. From 2012 there has been an ongoing debate in Sweden about whether yoga may be taught in schools, as religious instruction is forbidden in the state schooling system. Sweden's School Inspectorate decided in 2012 that √ñstermalm School in Stockholm could teach yoga as exercise. The scholar Erik af Edholm noted that since Ling's gymnastics had influenced modern yoga, the yoga now practised in Sweden was a secularised and reimported form of gymnastics. Sweden is, according to the Wall Street Journal, an \\"excellent place\\" for yoga retreats.

It was the first entirely original album in collegiate a cappella, for which it received critical recognition.  Background  A cappella, and especially collegiate a cappella, has its roots in covers of popular music. As a cappella proliferated on college campuses across the United States in the 1990s, the genre found favor with audiences by reinterpreting familiar songs. In 2016, music professor Joshua Duchan observed that audiences are drawn to a cappella because \\"the repertory includes a lot of covers, and it's often interesting to hear how popular songs... are reconfigured for the a cappella medium.\\" The reliance on covers had its critics. In 2004, Broadway producer and a cappella critic Elie Landau wrote about Deke Sharon's long-standing concern with cover songs: In the early 2000s, Sharon described a shift toward original music as \\"the biggest possible step for collegiate a cappella.\\" In 2006, the Contemporary A Cappella Society added a new category for best original song to its recorded a cappella awards.  Critical reception  The album was recognized for its status as the first collegiate a cappella album made up entirely of original songs. Critics praised the lyrics and the broad scope of its fifteen songs. Contemporary A Cappella Society president Deke Sharon called it \\"the most important collegiate a cappella album to be released in a decade.\\" Noting that Sharon had urged collegiate groups to pursue original material, Broadway producer and a cappella critic Elie Landau said, \\"the Fleet Street Singers of Stanford have answered Deke's call with probably the most gutsy and original collegiate album I've listened to in almost 20 years of active collegiate a cappella listening.\\" Landau also praised lyrics written by Mike Solomon, saying they seemed \\"equally informed by the cadences and meter of Eminem as they do by the alliteration and internal rhyming of Sondheim.\\" Critic Joshua Diamant called the album, \\"some of the most clever and sophisticated writing you'll hear all year.\\" Former Contemporary A Cappella Society president Jonathan Minkoff described the album as, \\"Some rock, some jazz, some really funny comedy.\\" Minkoff highlighted the album's storytelling, commenting, \\"The stories are so much more interesting than the typical baby-I- miss-you-cause-you're-gone crap clogging the airwaves.\\" Writing for The Recorded A Cappella Review Board, theater producer Elie Landau characterized the album's style as \\"Always wacky and zany... somewhere between the eccentric intellectualism of The Bobs and the somewhat more boisterous, more simplistic Da Vinci's Notebook.\\" Critics took issue with the mixing and the blend of the album. Landau wrote that he \\"[wished] the group and/or Bill had featured a bit more sensitivity to dynamics.\\" Diamant wrote, \\"some seriously bad blend mars many of the tracks on Fleet Street, as though the group had spent too much rehearsal time writing songs and not enough singing.\\"  Accolades  -  2005  Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards  Best Humor Song (Professional)  \\"Teen Angst\\" on Fleet Street (2004)    Impact on the group  The release of Fleet Street marked a turning point in the group's identity. After the album's release, members spoke more often of the group's original music than of the their humor, which had previously dominated the group's identity. At the group's 25th reunion in 2007, former music director Youngmoo Kim pointed to a change: \\"There are more originals now.\\" In 2011, then-music director Joel Chapman said during an interview, \\"One of the most important things we focus on is originality.\\" In a 2018 interview, singer Connor Meany characterized the group: \\"We've definitely evolved over time, but I think we still have the same core values‚Äîwriting our own music and being funny.\\" That shift in identity was reflected in Fleet Street's recorded music, as well. After the release of Fleet Street, Fleet Street went on to produce original music at a significantly higher rate than they had done previously. While the group's previous release (2001's Fearless) contained just 2 original songs, the group's next album, Through The Roof (2011) featured 10 original tracks and the following album featured another 11 original tracks. The percentage of original songs in each of Fleet Street's albums over time.  Influence  Although Fleet Street was hailed by critics as an \\"exciting new direction for collegiate a cappella\\", as of 2019, Fleet Street's impact on original music production by other collegiate a cappella groups has not been documented. In 2007, three years after the album's release, music scholar Joshua Duchan wrote that, \\"at its core, a cappella is about originality achieved through some form of emulation.\\" Later in the same paper, he wrote, \\"in recent years, original compositions have become more common,\\" but the lone example Duchan gave was the Stanford Fleet Street Singers' Fleet Street. In 2016, he re-affirmed that audiences should enjoy collegiate a cappella for its frequent use of cover songs.  Track listing  Credits adapted from liner notes.

Life Annette Leo was born in D√ºsseldorf, the eldest of her parents' daughters. When she was four her parents, relocating against the overwhelming east-west tide of central European migration during the 1950s, took her to live in East Berlin. She later discovered that the sudden move was triggered not - at least not directly - by political conviction, but by an instruction her father had received from the Communist Party: alongside his other work, her father was working for the party. The family took a winter break in Thuringia in 1952 and simply never returned to West Germany. Annette Leo grew up in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Gerhard Leo (1923 ‚Äì 2009), her father, was a Jewish journalist originally from Berlin who had escaped Nazi Germany and spent the war years as a R√©sistance fighter in France. Her mother, born Nora Lubinski (1922 ‚Äì 2010), was the daughter of Dagobert Lubinski (1893 ‚Äì 1943), another left-wing journalist and a resistance activist: he stayed in Germany and died at Auschwitz. As she grew up in East Berlin, anti-fascism was one of the things that bound the Leo family together. That never translated into a comfortable relationship with the allegedly anti-fascist East German state, however. In 1966 Annette Leo joined the party. (East Germany had been a one- party dictatorship since shortly after 1946.) 1966 was also the year in which she passed her Abitur (school final exams), opening the way to a university- level education. More immediately, however, she undertook a two year internship with the Berliner Zeitung (newspaper). Between 1968 and 1973 Leo studied History and Romance studies at the Humboldt University, at that time in East Berlin. Her son, Maxim Leo, was born in 1970 while she was still working for her degree. On graduating, she embarked on a career in journalism. One of the publications to which she contributed between 1979 and 1981 was the political and economic weekly magazine Horizont. She had always wanted to become a journalist, but now she hated it: \\"... party hacks and burned out security service employees ... people who put on a jacket to walk down the corridor\\". In 1982 she received her doctorate from Berlin University: her dissertation concerned the \\"Spanish Workers' Commissions in the struggle against Franco\\". Between 1982 and 1986 she worked as a contributing editor with the Neue Berliner Illustrierte (weekly magazine). Then, from 1986 till 1989, she supported herself as a freelance historian and journalist. As it began to appear that time was running out for the East German one-party dictatorship, in January 1990 Annette Leo was a co-founder of Die andere, described by backers as \\"the first alternative [weekly] newspaper in the German Democratic Republic\\". After reunification, between 1991 and 1993 Leo took an academic position at the Prenzlauer Berg Museum on the south side of Berlin. Then from 1993 till 1996she worked with the Research Institute for Workers' Education (\\"Forschungsinstitut Arbeit, Bildung, Partizipation\\") at Recklinghausen. Here she worked on the oral history project \\"Politisch- gesellschaftlicher Wandel im Geschichtsbewusstsein von Arbeitnehmern in den alten und neuen Bundesl√§ndern\\" (loosely, \\"social and political change in historical awareness of workers in the old and new federal states (i.e. in former West Germany and former East Germany))\\". She worked between 2001 and 2005 with the Center for Research on Antisemitism at the so-called Technical University of Berlin. While working at the centre, in 2004 she published a biography of the linguist and folklorist Wolfgang Steinitz (1905 ‚Äì 1967). In 2006 Leo became a research associate at the Historical Institute of the University of Jena, where for some years she also held a teaching chair. The Steinitz book was not her first serious biography. In 1991 Annette Leo published \\"Briefe zwischen Kommen und Gehen\\", a biography of Dagobert Lubinski, her maternal grandfather who had been a communist journalist and a resistance fighter. Lubinski was also Jewish and was murdered at Auschwitz. In 2008 Annette Leo received the Annalise Wagner Prize for a piece of work she produced on daily life in the Ravensbr√ºck women's concentration camp at F√ºrstenberg during the Hitler years. In 2012 her biography of Erwin Strittmatter (1912 ‚Äì 1994) triggered a widespread debate on the author's historical role as one of the most popular novelists in the German Democratic Republic. Annette Leo's 2018 documentary film \\"Das Kind auf der Liste\\" (\\"The child on the list\\") presents the story of the Sinto child Willy Blum and his family. In 1944 Willy Blum, then aged 16, was taken with his 10 year old brother Rudolf from the Buchenwald concentration camp to the Auschwitz concentration camp where both boys were murdered. They were part of a batch of 200 children and young people sent on the death train from Buchenwald to Auschwitz. Originally the two hundredth on the list was to have been the three year old toddler Stefan Jerzy Zweig but at some stage someone had crossed out Zweig's name and substituted that of the Sinto child. The fates of the boy who died and that of the boy who survived were accordingly always intertwined. A heavily politicised version of the story from the perspective of Zweig (who has subsequently achieved a measure of notability on his own account as an author and cameraman) was already familiar to many German readers, cinema goers and television audiences thanks to the success of the 1958 East German novel Naked Among Wolves which has been adapted for the big screen and (at least twice) for the small screen, but until Annette Leo produced her documentary the story of the boys who died was unknown. At least one critic reacted by asking why it had taken so long for the story of the Blum boys to come into the public sphere (\\"Endlich! Warum erst jetzt?\\"). Maxim Annette Leo's son, Maxim Leo (born 30 January 1970) is a Franco-German author, screen- write and journalist who writes for the Berliner Zeitung.

The team was chosen prior to the formation of the Auckland Rugby League so in some respects were an ‚Äòunofficial‚Äô Auckland team though they were very strong nonetheless and many of the players went on to represent Auckland and New Zealand in the ensuing years. Several of the players were also strongly involved in the establishment of club sides and the growth of the game in Auckland for many years to come such as Albert Asher, Charles Dunning, William Wynyard, and Ronald MacDonald. The games The four matches were against Wellington and Taranaki with games being played in Auckland, Wellington and New Plymouth. They resulted in 3 wins and a draw. Prior to the last match of the season against Taranaki at Victoria Park the promoters of the proposed Auckland League stated clearly their intentions. They said that it was not their intention to pay players for home matches. If any profits accrued from their last match it would be ‚Äúbanked to form the nucleus of a ground fund. It will be the policy of the league to provide players with uniforms, free brake trips to grounds, and payment for loss of wages when away from Auckland on tour‚Äù. They went on to say that the tour had not been profitable. The money they had gained from Wellington‚Äôs visit in August had been lost while on tour due to travel costs and other expenditure. They hoped to ‚Äústimulate a strong local competitions next season‚Äù and had secured a ground at Epsom for play. Representative matches Match vs. Wellington Tour match v Wellington Tour match v Taranaki This match was originally supposed to be played on the recreation ground but after pressure from the rugby union it was moved to the Tukapa Cricket Field adjacent to Western Park. There were further issues with seating as the advertised seats for spectators did not arrive at the ground. Taranaki won the match by 5 points to 3 and it was suggested that Auckland had deliberately thrown the match to stir up interest in the return match. Though the closeness of the game back in Auckland would suggest this might not have been the case.

He is known for screenwriting with his late brother Mark Estrin, co-writing a novel with Joseph Telushkin, and his current work with Dennis Prager. With Prager he co-founded PragerU and serves as the executive producer of the Dennis Prager Show. Career Estrin co-founded the digital media website PragerU, short for \\"Prager University\\", with Dennis Prager and is currently the executive producer of The Dennis Prager Show. When Estrin originally conceptualized PragerU, he had planned for it to be a brick-and- mortar university, but later proposed instead that they create short educational videos online. Estrin credits a copyright lawsuit with forcing PragerU videos to stop using photographs, and Jeremy Boreing with helping to develop their current animation style. Estrin represented PragerU at President Donald Trump's \\"Social Media Summit\\" in July, 2019. He predicts that leftists will eventually create their equivalent of PragerU. Estrin was a screenwriter for several television shows including: * Boston Public (2002) * Touched by an Angel (1997-2000) * The Practice (1997-1999). He also co-wrote Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World. And with his brother Mark Estrin (1947-2005) he wrote Bare Essentials, and Warm Hearts, Cold Feet. He was also a co-producer for Bare Essentials. With Prager, David Zucker, and Susan Silverberg Grossand he wrote For Goodness Sake. He and Prager wrote a sequel, For Goodness Sake II. Estrin is a lecturer in screenwriting at the American Film Institute. He directed \\"Israel in a Time of Terror\\". Books Estrin wrote The Hollywood Professionals, Volume 6: Capra, Cukor and Brown, published in 1980, about directors Frank Capra, George Cukor, and Clarence Brown. With Joseph Telushkin, Estrin also co-wrote the novel Heaven's Witness, published in 2004. Publishers Weekly offered a mostly positive review, saying \\"Detailed backstories, plus numerous psychoanalytical and New Age tidbits, slow the plot in places, but the past-life angle sustains interest.\\" The Washington Examiner praised the book as \\"the most interesting of this year's religious mysteries.\\" Kirkus Reviews said it was \\"especially good at balancing belief and skepticism about reincarnation.\\" And the Jewish Journal called the book \\"a page-turning whodunit\\" that \\"raises some lofty questions about the nature of the afterlife and what happens to us after we die.\\" CBS optioned this book for a 2005 TV movie, paid both authors to write the script, but then stopped making such movies. Personal life Estrin married Susan Chamberlain in 1985. He is the son of Donald and Mildred Estrin, with brothers Joel and Mark, and a sister Amy. A scholar of the movies, Estrin has brought his knowledge of film to the Dennis Prager Show, where Prager calls him the \\"Living Martyr\\". Estrin is a honey aficionado. In 2002, Estrin was denied life insurance because he traveled to Israel. Because of this, he sued 14 insurance companies. This led to some insurers changing such policies, and to a bill in California to outlaw such travel restrictions on policies.

Biography and scientific work  Th√©'s father was a doctor and biologist. He spent the first years of his life in the United States. After a period in preparatory classes, he studied medicine and biological sciences in parallel, first in Lyon, then at the Necker Hospital in Paris. Received at the Paris Hospital Boarding School in 1984, he chose the medical research internship he did in Pierre Tiollais' laboratory at the Pasteur Institute. His thesis and post-doctoral work in this laboratory will enable him to make significant contributions to the understanding of retinoic acid signalling, in particular with the cloning of RARB and the identification of the first element of response to this hormone.de The, H., A.

He is a member of the French Academy of sciences.  Biography  He has been Director of the Philosophy Department at √âcole Normale Sup√©rieur (ENS) Ulm since 2002 and is now Director Emeritus. He has been a member of the French Academy of sciences since 15 March 2011. Disciple of Georges Canguilhem, agr√©g√© de philosophie (1974), Docteur √®s lettres (1982) and director of research at the CNRS, he was a student at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure de la rue d'Ulm. In 1990, he published a book on philosophy of science on the dream entitled \\"Neurophilosophy of the Dream\\". In 1994, he co-wrote with Tonia Cariffa a monograph on the painter Eska Kayser.  Scientific work  With a dual background in philosophy and life sciences, Claude Debru has devoted his work to the history and epistemology of life sciences and medicine. Student of the philosopher Georges Canguilhem, trained in the conceptual history of philosophy and science through his postgraduate thesis on the theory of space, he turned to biochemistry and wrote his State thesis on the history of protein biochemistry, in contact with biophysicochemists Jeffries Wyman, John Edsall and Ren√© Wurmser. In this work, which considers both the long historical duration and the strictly philosophical problems raised by the new biochemistry, as well as the most recent developments, he analyzed the evolution of new theoretical models of allosteric protein function from the perspective of structure-function relationships. Two books have been devoted to this new \\"molecular philosophy\\". Then, wishing to approach the more strictly experimental aspects of life sciences, and in particular the new neurosciences, he joined, as an epistemologist, the Department of Experimental Medicine of the Faculty of Medicine of Lyon headed by Michel Jouvet, to study the development of research on REM sleep and dreams, mainly from the philosophical angle of \\"psychophysiological parallelism\\", which involved all disciplines of neuroscience, and from that of functional hypotheses, making REM sleep play a functional role in the individuation of the brain. This long- term stay resulted in the publication of a book. In contact with hematologists Jean Bernard, Marcel Bessis and Jacques-Louis Binet, Claude Debru also learned about the problems of cell morphology and pathophysiology of leukaemias, and participated in several projects at the Centre d'√©cologie cellulaire de la Salp√™tri√®re. From this body of experience in the biological and medical sciences, Claude Debru drew the substance from a new book of epistemology and history in order to analyse the process of research and discovery, analysing some of Claude Bernard's work in the light of artificial intelligence, questioning the resolution of the paradoxes that have given rise to neuroendocrinology, unclassifiable leukaemias or cell death. Extending his investigation to new biotechnologies, Claude Debru reflected on their relationship to the notion of possibility and their biological justification. Returning to neuroscience, its history and its relationship to philosophy, Claude Debru has undertaken several studies on the development of neuroscience in France after the Second World War and on the temporal aspects of brain function, from William James to recent developments, establishing a long-term collaboration with Pierre Buser. This collaboration continued with Alain Berthoz on the theme of anticipation. Collaborations with the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina have resulted in several publications, on imagination and intuition in science, on the Enlightenment, on science and academia during the First World War.

This subsidiary is headed by President/CCO Gary Marsh and is responsible for operating cable Disney Channels in the United States, such as Disney Channel, Disney XD, Disney Junior, plus Radio Disney, Disney Television Animation and It's a Laugh Productions. Disney Channels Worldwide oversaw all Disney channels worldwide until the organization of the Walt Disney Direct-to- Consumer & International segment on March 14, 2018 when the unit was split into two. Alan Wagner (1983-1984) Wagner left CBS in 1982 when the Walt Disney Company approached him to become the first president of the Disney Channel. The cable channel was a novel idea at the time, being the first cable station to be entirely dedicated to programming for children and the family. Given a $100 million budget, Wagner put together a staff of programmers to create new shows for the channel in addition to drawing from Disney‚Äôs extensive collection of prior television programs and films. The channel's first broadcasting day aired on April 18, 1983. It initially started with a 16-hour-a-day service. Wagner left the Disney Channel after the station's first year of programming, after which he formed his own independent film and television production company, Boardwalk Entertainment. Anne Sweeney (1996-2004) Sweeney joined The Walt Disney Company in February 1996 as president of Disney Channel and executive vice president of Disney/ABC Cable Networks. From October 2000 to April 2004, Sweeney served as president of ABC Cable Networks Group and The Disney Channel Worldwide. Continuing with the strategy that was begun by her predecessor John F. Cooke, The Disney Channel more than quintupled its subscriber base with its mix of original series and movies and acquired programming. It is now available on basic cable in more than 87 million homes in the United States. Disney Channel executives hoped to become more \\"boy friendly\\" in 2010; especially when Good Luck Charlie premiered and when Aaron Stone and Zeke and Luther joined the main program line-up. In April 2004, she was named president of the Disney/ABC Television Group. In this role, Sweeney is responsible for Disney's entertainment and news television properties globally. These include the ABC Television Network, which encompasses ABC Entertainment, ABC Kids, ABC Daytime, ABC Sports and ABC News; ABC Studios, which is the television production division of the Disney- ABC Television Group; and Disney ABC Cable Networks Group, comprising The Disney Channel Worldwide‚Äîwhich has grown to 24 wholly owned international channels‚ÄîToon Disney, SOAPnet, ABC Family and Jetix. She oversees Walt Disney Television Animation, Buena Vista Worldwide Television and Walt Disney Television International, and has responsibility for managing Disney's equity interests in Lifetime Entertainment Services, and A&E; Television Networks. Rich Ross (2004-2009) In 1996, Ross joined Disney Channel in programming and production as a senior vice president, becoming general manager and executive vice president in 1999. In 2002 he became president of entertainment for Disney Channel, before being named president of Disney Channels Worldwide in 2004, where he oversaw the Disney Channel, Disney XD, Playhouse Disney, Disney Cinemagic, Hungama, GXT, Jetix, and Radio Disney brands. He is credited with establishing Disney's global kids' TV business as the prime entertainment source for the tween market with shows like Hannah Montana, Lizzie McGuire, Wizards of Waverly Place, The Suite Life of Zack & Cody and The Suite Life on Deck, That's So Raven and Phineas and Ferb. He launched the highly successful Disney Channel Original Movie franchise that produced the worldwide hit High School Musical series, as well as the Camp Rock and The Cheetah Girls series.

She is a three-weight world champion, having held the WBO female bantamweight title since 2017 and previously in 2013; the WBO female super flyweight title from 2014 to 2017; and the IBF female junior featherweight title in 2018. She also challenged for the WBA female light flyweight title in 2011 and the WBO female flyweight title in 2014. As of September 2020, she is ranked as the world's best active female bantamweight by The Ring and second by BoxRec, as well as the eighth best active female, pound for pound, by The Ring and ESPN, and tenth by BoxRec. She is the older sister of IBF female light flyweight champion Evelyn Nazarena Berm√∫dez.  Early life  Daniela Romina Berm√∫dez was born on 7 July 1989 in Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina. She comes from a fighting family where three of her five siblings are fellow boxers; Roxana, Gustavo and IBF light-flyweight champion, Evelyn. The family own a gym called Berm√∫dez Boxing Club in Villa Gobernador G√°lvez, Santa Fe.  Professional career  Berm√∫dez made her professional debut on 26 March 2010, scoring a four-round split decision (SD) victory over Roxana Virginia Baron at the Estadio Pedro Estremador in Bariloche, Argentina. She fought a further four times in 2010; a knockout (KO) win over Maria Terriaza in April; two consecutive majority draws (MD) against Betiana Patricia Vinas in July and October; and a four-round unanimous decision (UD) win over Graciela Ines De Luca in November. She began 2011 with a unanimous decision win over Cristina del Valle Pacheco in February, followed by a ten-round unanimous decision loss to Edith Soledad Matthysse in April and a six-round majority decision (MD) win in a rematch with Matthysse in August. A month later she made her first attempt at a world title by challenging reigning WBA light-flyweight champion Y√©sica Bopp on 24 September at the Polideportivo Posta del Retamo in Jun√≠n, Argentina. Berm√∫dez lost via unanimous decision over ten rounds, with the judges' scorecards reading 100‚Äì90, 97‚Äì94 and 96‚Äì94. Berm√∫dez ended the year with a six-round unanimous decision victory over Norma Elizabeth Diaz Caucota in November. Following a second-round technical knockout (TKO) win over Marta Soledad Juncos in January 2012, she faced Mayerlin Rivas on 31 March at Club Atl√©tico Talleres in Villa Gonernador G√°lvez, Argentina, with the vacant WBA interim bantamweight title on the line. Berm√∫dez captured the interim title by majority decision over ten rounds. One judge scored the bout a draw at 95‚Äì95, while the other two scored it 95‚Äì94 and 96‚Äì94 in favour of Berm√∫dez. Two months after winning the WBA interim bantamweight title, she moved down a weight class to fight Judith Rodriguez on 12 May at Club America in Buenos Aires, this time for the vacant WBA interim super-flyweight title. Berm√∫dez won the bout via ten-round unanimous decision, with the scorecards reading 99‚Äì91, 97‚Äì94 and 96‚Äì94. She fought another two times in 2012; a successful defence of her interim super-flyweight title via second-round technical knockout against Olga Julio in August and a unanimous decision victory over Anahi Yolanda Salles in a six-round non-title bout in December.

Biography  According to the Chinese annals, he reigned over a prosperous kingdom influenced by Shaivism, but at the same time other religions were equally well represented in his kingdom. An inscription was also attributed to his wife, Queen Kulaprabhavati, who laid the foundation of Vaishnavism in the kingdom. On the other hand, two events confirm that Buddhism was also well established. The first concerns the demand made in 484 CE for military aid to the emperor Wudi against the Kingdom of ChampƒÅ, guilty of boarding and looting the merchant ships of the country. Even if the request was rejected, the copy preserved by the Chinese archives shows a perfect knowledge of the Buddhist canon that only a thorough study can allow . The second index relates to the sending to China of two Buddhist monks, Mandrasena in 503 CE and Sanghapala in 508 CE. Jayavarman Kaundinya sent two more embassies in middle empire in 511 CE and in 514 CE, the year of his death. His eldest son, Rudravarman, born of a concubine, then murdered the legitimate heir, Gunavarman, to seize the throne and was the last ruler of Funan, that is mentioned in the Chinese annals.

He is celebrated in folklore as the first Muslim to live in the Sylhet region. Life It is said that there were around 13 Muslim families which settled in the mahalla of Tultikar with Burhanuddin being the chief of this minority group. The ancestors of these thirteen families entered the subcontinent after Muhammad bin Qasim's early 8th century conquest of Sindh and travelled to Chittagong via ship. From there, they eventually reached Sylhet for dawah and business-related purposes. The village which the thirteen families settled in still exists today in Tultikar and is known as Tero Ratan village (‡¶§‡ßá‡¶∞‡¶∞‡¶§‡¶® thirteen pearls). During the celebration of his newborn son's aqiqah, Burhanuddin decided to sacrifice a cow. Gour Govinda, the King of Sylhet, was angered for what he saw as sacrilege due to his Hindu beliefs and had the newborn, Gulzar Alam, killed as well as Burhanuddin's right hand cut off.EB, Suharwardy Yemani Sylheti, Shaikhul Mashaikh Hazrat Makhdum Ghazi Shaikh Jalaluddin Mujjarad, in Hanif, N. \\"Biographical Encyclopaedia of Sufis: Central Asia and Middle East. Vol. 2\\". Sarup & Sons, 2002. p.459 Govinda had a reputation of being intolerant of minority peoples following faiths such as Islam, Buddhism and certain sects of Hinduism. Shortly after this incident, Qazi Nuruddin of Taraf celebrated his son's marriage ceremony of his son by slaughtering a cow for them to eat and was also punished by Taraf's feudal ruler, Achak Narayan. After both men being punished, Burhanuddin and Nuruddin's brother, Helimuddin, travelled to lower Bengal where they addressed their issues with Sultan Shamsuddin Firoz Shah. A number of battles took place in order to conquer Sylhet and fight injustice, with Burhanuddin acting as guide. This expedition came to be known as the Conquest of Sylhet. The region was finally conquered with the help of a force led by Shah Jalal and his companions in 1303. Legacy A road in Sylhet is named after him as Sayed Burhanuddin Road in Burhanabad (also named after him), Kushighat, Tultikar. A school called Ghazi Burhan Uddin Primary School can also be found in the road. The road also contains him mazar (mausoleum).

It merged in 2000 with the Martigny-Ch√¢telard Railway (Chemin de fer Martigny-Ch√¢telard, MC) to form Transports de Martigny et R√©gions (TMR). The MO's line consisted of the 19 km- long line from Martigny via Sembrancher to Orsi√®res in the Val d‚ÄôEntremont and the 6 km-long branch line from Sembrancher to Le Ch√¢ble in the Val de Bagnes.  History Mixed train from the opening years The MO was granted a concession to build a standard gauge line from Martigny to Orsi√®res in 1906. The railway company was established as a result of British Aluminium's plan to build an aluminum plant in Orsi√®res. The ground-breaking ceremony was held on 23 July 1907 and operations commenced on 1 September 1910. The railway has been electrified at 8000 V 15 Hz AC since the beginning of operations. Traffic remained modest because neither the aluminium works nor the planned connection to the Aosta Valley were built. The MO was one of the first railway companies to supplement its rail activity with bus operations. The railway was later nationalised. NINA railcar in the terminus of Le Ch√¢ble. The line was converted to SBB's 15 kV AC railway electrification system on 4 March 1949. This meant that traction vehicles of the SBB could also be used on the MO. The branch line from Sembrancher to Le Ch√¢ble was opened on 5 August 1953 and served the construction of the Mauvoisin power station. The cement trains were hauled by SBB locomotives. Originally goods traffic dominated operations on the MO. Since the 1970s, growing tourism has led to increased passenger traffic. Two ABDe 4/4 railcars (6 and 8) collided front on at Martigny-Bourg on 1 September 1984. The train driver started towards Orsi√®res despite the exit signal being at danger. The driver and five passengers were killed and 24 people were injured. The two railcars were rebuilt. The destroyed Bt 31 control car was replaced by a similar vehicle from the R√©gional du Val-de- Travers (RVT). The MO merged with the Martigny-Ch√¢telard Railway to form the Transports de Martigny et R√©gions (TMR) on 1 January 2000.  Rolling stock To start operations, MO procured two BCFe 4/4 passenger railcars (1‚Äì2) and two CFe 4/4 luggage railcars (11‚Äì12) with folding seats for passenger services. All four vehicles had the same electrical equipment with repulsion motors. The railcars were completely rebuilt with the conversion of the power system in 1949. BCFe 4/4 passenger railcars (3‚Äì4) were converted from the two baggage railcars. The railcars were supplemented with ABDe 4/4 5 in 1955. A comprehensive renewal of the rolling stock took place from 1962 to 1965. The MO procured three ABDe 4/4 EAV (Eidgen√∂ssischen Amt f√ºr Verkehr‚Äî\\"Federal Office of Transport\\") railcars (6‚Äì8), three associated Bt control cars (31‚Äì33) and two standard passenger coaches (Einheitspersonenwagen).

After the war, Kosiah moved to Switzerland, where he obtained permanent residence.  Arrest  On 10 November 2014, Swiss authorities arrested Kosiah in connection with accusations that he was involved in mass killings in parts of Liberia's Lofa County from 1993 to 1995.

Biography  Kacpura is a graduate from University of Warsaw, Poland and holds a post graduate from the Polish Institute of International Affairs. She advocates for the defence of sexual and reproductive rights in Poland. She worked in the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a number of years. She is the director of the Federation for Women and Family Planning. She is also Executive Director of ASTRA (Central and Eastern European Women‚Äôs Network for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights). The ASTRA network was established in 1999 and has 28 members organisations from 17 countries. She has been active in the field of reproductive health and rights for over 20 years. Kacupura has authored many publications on sexual and reproductive health and rights in Central and Eastern Europe. As part of ASTRA, she has co-authored a report on 'Sexual and reproductive health rights and the implication of conscientious objection', at the request of the FEMM Committee.  Activism  As part of her work with Federation for Women and Family Planning, Kacpura was involved in the organising the Polish Women's Strike, known as Black Monday. 90,000 people gathered on the streets of Warsaw, which according to Urgent Action Fund alerted the international community triggering interventions by UN human rights experts, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights and 200 NGOs. Kacpura organised a campaign to raise awareness of the implications of a proposed total ban of abortion in Poland tabled by the Stop Abortion Initiative The campaign included the distribution of leaflets to women on the streets, in shops, offices and school and the mobilisation of women to engage in street debates and demonstrations against the bill. She spoke publicly calling for solidarity and support from politicians; appealed to gynaecologists to support the campaign. She explains in an interview. 'It was like I was in a trance: thousands of individual conversations; dozens of debates, demonstrations, marches; hundreds of phone calls, emails. I knew I had to find the strength to keep going. When I was tired, I opened my drawer with the signatures of hundreds of Poles under the Save Women Initiative ‚Äì a reminder that all those people trusted me and my organisation'. The Urgent Action Fund supported her work. Much of her work highlights the issues surrounding the \\"conscientious objections\\" by Polish doctors that negatively impact on women's ability to access abortion services in Poland. The Federation for Women and Family Planning monitors hospital procedures and the experience of women seeking abortions and maintains a helpline.

The purpose of the order is said to be to prevent antisemitism by making it easier to use laws prohibiting institutional discrimination against people based on race, color or national origin to punish discrimination against Jewish people, including opposition to policies undertaken by the government of Israel. CNN claimed that a White House official had indicated that the order would define Judaism as a nationality instead of a religion in the United States, though the order ultimately released did not state this. The order set off a firestorm of criticism among many Jewish and Palestinian leaders. Some American Jews praised the order, while others objected to defining Judaism as a nationality (as the order was initially indicated to do, though it ultimately did not), claiming that \\"Trump's reclassification of Judaism mirrored sentiments used by white nationalists and Nazi Germany\\" and that \\"the move appears to question whether Jews are really American\\".

As of December 2019, the network comprises 32 observatories located worldwide, including universities such as the University of South Africa, the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, and the California Polytechnic State University. The participants are searching for new potentially habitable exoplanets around non-flare G, K or M-type stars located within 100 light years. The initial list of targets consists of 10 stars that already have known transiting exoplanets outside the habitable zone. The network is monitoring 24/7 each star at a time during several months. Despite G and K-type stars are the main targets of the project, the team is initially focusing on red dwarfs because it take less time to discard the existence of potentially habitable exoplanets around these type of stars. Most of the observatories are able to detect transit depths as low as 0.1% and exoplanets with a radius of 0.7 Earth radii. To search for new exoplanets, the team is using two different methods: transit photometry and transit duration variation. Overall, the project is a new approach to the quest for exoplanets in which a large network of astronomers located in the five continents have the time to continuously observe each star individually during long periods of time in the search for dips in brightness produced by transiting exoplanets. As of December 2019, the network has already conducted observations on GJ 436 and GJ 1214, with a new campaign on GJ 3470 starting in January 2020.

Cranberry fruit rot can be categorized into field rot (rot occurring while growing and before harvest) and storage rot (occurring any time after harvest).McManus, P. Cranberry fruit rot diseases in Wisconsin. 4 (2001). The importance of field rot and fruit rot depends on how the cranberries will be processed after harvest. If cranberries are immediately processed after harvest, growers focus on preventing field rot while with fresh market cranberries, growers seek to prevent storage rot. There are 10-15 fungal pathogens known to cause cranberry fruit rot diseases, some active in only field rot, storage rot, or both. The majority of these fungal pathogens are ascomycetes, with the rest being deuteromycetes. There is no known bacterial pathogen that plays a role in CFR or any major disease on cranberry, potentially due to the low pH conditions on the cranberry fruit.  Host and symptoms  In cranberries, the fruit rot pathogens can infect before or after harvest. The symptoms of a rot are related to a general softening and deterioration of the cranberry, which occur both in the field and in storage. Each specific rot disease that make up the CFR disease complex are caused by specific pathogens (Table 1). An example is the field rot cotton ball caused by Monilinia oxycocci, common in Wisconsin, while bitter rot caused by Glomerella cingulate occurs generally in Massachusetts. However, these pathogens have been shown to not be entirely specific to their areas. These symptoms can often resemble other forms of fruit deterioration such as sunscald, hail damage, and temporal physiological breakdown. {  +Table 1. Adapted from McManus 2001. !Disease !Fungus !Field Rot !Storage Rot - bitter rot Colletotrichum acutatum Colletotrichum gloeosporioides X  - cottonball rot Monilinia oxycocci X  - early rot Phyllosticta vaccinii X  - berry speckle Phyllosticta elongata X X - blotch rot Physalospora vaccinii X X - end rot Fusicoccum putrefaciens X X - ripe rot Coleophoma empetr X X - viscid rot Phomopsis vaccinii X X - yellow rot Botrytis sp. X X - black rot Allantophomopsis lycopodina Allantophomopsis cytisporea Strasseria geniculata  X }  Disease cycles  Due to the complexity and number of fungal pathogens involved in CFR, the specific disease cycles have yet to be fully studied. Researchers believe almost every fruit rot pathogen completes a disease cycle every 1‚Äì3 years. Researchers however have hypothesized 3 potential disease cycles taken by the pathogens. These 3 disease cycles rely heavily on leaves or stems, either debris or living, mainly because all berries are harvested. * Type 1. Fungal inoculum overwinters in plant debris in the soil surface. In the spring, the fungi produce fruiting bodies and infect developing plants. The main infection occurs when flowers bloom and during the early parts of fruit development. * Type 2. Fungi persist in living leaves then infect as the plant develops fruit while leaves drop. * Type 3. Fungal inoculum overwinter in plant debris and infect during cranberry harvest. When the floodwater is released during harvest, spores are dispersed and infect through potential wounds from equipment.  Management  The management of CFR can be complicated and varies due to the number of pathogens and the temporal aspect of fruit rot. Fungicides applied during the projected times of infection and on potential areas, such as flowers and after fruit set, are effective at deterring fruit rot. Due to the number of pathogens, general fungicides such as chlorothalonil, instead of specific-targeting fungicides, are more effective. However, fungicides can reduce fruit quality and fruit set in some cases, thus their use is often limited. Harvest can also play a role in reducing the risk of pathogens. Wet harvest using floodwater, although quicker and easier, can spread pathogens, which would increase chances of storage rot. Dry harvests can cause more damage to vines and take longer, but can reduce disease spread and decrease the potential of storage rot. Depending on the final use of cranberries, each harvest type can be beneficial. Sanding, a process where sand is laid on the field to stimulate root growth from the harvested cranberries, could actually play a role in covering up inoculum with plant debris, which may decrease the chances of field and storage rot. Resistance and biological controls have proved difficult to validate due to the disease complex being composed of different fungal pathogens.

Ward (September 1, 1813 ‚Äì April 29, 1891) was an American Catholic priest and Jesuit. He taught for many years at Georgetown and at the novitiate in Frederick, Maryland, of which he twice served as rector. He then became the vice president of Georgetown and was influential in the early years of Loyola College in Maryland. From 1857 to 1860, he was the President of Saint Joseph's College. He spent his later years as socius (assistant) to the Jesuit provincial superior in New York City, and teaching.  Early life  James A. Ward was born on September 1, 1813, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. At a young age, he moved to Washington, D.C. to live with his uncle, near the Capitol building. His uncle enrolled him in Washington Seminary (later known as Gonzaga College High School) and he enrolled in Georgetown College in 1829. While there, he entered the Society of Jesus on August 6, 1832, and proceeded to the Jesuit novitiate in White Marsh, Maryland. He became the second to last surviving Jesuit educated at the novitiate in White Marsh, which had moved to Frederick, Maryland in 1834.  Teaching  In 1833, he returned to Georgetown, where he taught and remained for the rest of his scholasticate. At Georgetown, Ward was ordained a priest of the Catholic Church by Archbishop Samuel Eccleston on July 4, 1843. As a professor, he taught higher mathematics and classics. Around this time, he developed health problems that left him temporarily unable to speak and later with impaired speech, which prevented him from preaching. Ward completed his theological studies and continued teaching at Georgetown for another six years. From 1845 to 1846, he taught rhetoric, before becoming minister and prefect of schools. In 1850, while still prefect, he was appointed vice president of Georgetown. On one occasion, while the President of Georgetown College, James A. Ryder, was away from the school, a student rebellion broke out, which Ward was able to quell. In September 1850, he returned to the novitiate in Frederick, where he taught mathematics. The following year, he was put in charge of classes at the Washington Seminary. Ward played a key role in the early years of Loyola College in Maryland, which was founded in 1852. For a time, he served as its prefect of studies. In 1857, he became President of Saint Joseph's College in Philadelphia, succeeding James A. Ryder. His term ended in 1860, when he was succeeded by Felix-Joseph Barbelin. He is depicted as a gargoyle on Barbelin Hall at Saint Joseph's University.  Later years  With the start of the American Civil War, Ward made publicly known his fervent support of the Confederacy. Following the war, he returned to Georgetown in 1865 as vice president, prefect of studies, and professor of rhetoric, where he remained until 1869 when he was made rector of the novitiate in Frederick, replacing Joseph O'Callaghan, who died at sea on his return from the Jesuit general congregation in Rome. He also taught as a professor at the novitiate until 1873, when he ceased teaching to become the master of novices, while still remaining rector. For many years, Ward was also the socius (assistant) to the provincial superior, which required him to live near St. Francis Xavier College in New York City. For ten years, Ward was the prefect of studies at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts and at Loyola College in Maryland, and then again served as rector of the novitiate in Frederick from 1890 to 1891. Finally, he returned to Georgetown, where he served as spiritual father. Ward died at Georgetown University on April 29, 1891.

(Original description) The shell is narrowly elongate, convex, in shape resembling several species of the genus Engina Gray, 1839. The shell is peculiarly attenuated and contracted towards the base, the spire pointed. The color of the shell is white, banded with a single somewhat irregular yellow band, repeated a little below the middle of the body whorl. Some of the granules on this band are yellow, whilst others are white. The shell contains seven whorls, distantly reticulated with thick, obtuse, longitudinal and transverse keels. The interstices, under a lens, are minutely and closely longitudinally striated. The sculpture is very distinct and clearly marked on the last two whorls, but much confused and difficult to trace on the upper ones. Pearl-like granules are formed where the ridges cross one another, in the present shell however they are more regular in size and more rounded. There are three rows of these granules on each whorl, besides an additional smaller one and some indistinct transverse ridges close to the suture. There are ten longitudinal keels on the body whorl. The sinus is deep, but rather contracted, bent down rather abruptly. The aperture is very straight and narrow, suddenly widening a little close to the end of the siphonal canal. There are seven rather large regular granules at the inner margin of the outer lip.

The company completed 124 examples of the design between 1980 and 1985, but it is now out of production. Design The Cape Dory 33 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with a balsa-cored deck and teak wooden cockpit coamings and trim. It has a masthead sloop rig or optional cutter rig, a spooned raked stem, a raised counter transom, a keel- mounted rudder controlled by a wheel and a fixed long keel.

The mainsheet is attached to a mainsheet traveler on the bridge deck. There are five winches for the mainsail halyard, genoa halyard, jiffy reefing and the genoa sheets. The sleeping accommodation is somewhat unconventional, with a single berth mounted in the port side of bow, with a seat and bureau in that cabin. The berth may be also converted into a double. In the main cabin are settee berths, including one that converts to a double and a third quarter berth in the aft main cabin, partially under the cockpit and adjoining the navigation table. The head is forward and to the port side and includes a privacy door and shower. The galley is on the port side, at the bottom of the companionway steps and includes a three-burner, alcohol-fired stove. The cabin sole is made from teak and holly. Ventilation is provided by two opening hatches, one each above the main cabin and the bow cabin. There are also five opening bronze ports on each side of the cabin and also dorade vents.

Specialising in transmission and textual criticism, he was considered a leading expert on the work of Ovid and Lucretius. He spent the majority of his career at Cambridge University, where he was an emeritus fellow of Peterhouse until his death in 2019. He was known for his exacting but constructive criticism. When interviewing candidates for admittance to the college, he would assess them using the \\"Fufu test\\". His pet cat Fufu would be on the candidate's chair and they would be judged by the manner in which they treated it. The more kindly they treated the cat, the more likely they were to be admitted. Biography Kenney was educated at Christ's Hospital in Horsham, West Sussex. During the Second World War, he served in the Royal Corps of Signals in Britain and India. He then went on to read Classics at Trinity College, Cambridge, and was awarded a BA in 1949. After a brief spell as assistant lecturer at the University of Leeds, Kenney returned to Cambridge, first as a research fellow at Trinity College and from 1953 as a fellow of Peterhouse. In 1974, he was named the seventh Kennedy Professor of Latin, an appointment which he held until his retirement in 1982.

It was to be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It would have featured a 2,000,000 prize pool and twenty-four professional teams from around the world as with previous Majors. Twenty four teams around the world will qualify through regional qualifiers called the Road to Rio. It will be the seventh time ESL will be hosting a Major. The Major was originally scheduled to take place from May 11 to May 24, 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Valve and ESL announced that the Major tournament was postponed to November. In September 2020, Valve and ESL announced that the CS:GO major will be canceled.  Background  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Hidden Path Entertainment and Valve. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series. In competitive play, the game pits two teams against each other: the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists. Both sides are tasked with eliminating the other while also completing separate objectives. The Terrorists must either plant a bomb or kill the entire Counter-Terrorist team, while the Counter-Terrorists must either prevent the bomb from being planted by killing the entire Terrorist team or defusing the bomb. Once the bomb is planted, counter-terrorists have forty seconds to defuse the bomb; under normal circumstances, it takes ten seconds to defuse the bomb, but purchasing a defuse kit reduces the defuse time to five seconds. At the end of each round, players are rewarded based on their individual performance with in-game currency to spend on more powerful weapons in subsequent rounds. Winning rounds results in more money than losing, and completing objectives such as killing enemy players gives cash bonuses. However, the more consecutive rounds a team loses, the more money the losing team earns, with the loss bonus capping after five rounds; once that team wins a round, the loss round bonus resets to the minimum amount each player could earn after a round.  Format  There are six regional qualifiers ‚Äì North America, South America, Europe, CIS, Asia, and Oceania. Each regional qualifier received a set number of spots in the Rio Major. The number of spots corresponds with the number of teams from that region at the previous major, the Berlin Major.  Regional Major Rankings   Road to Rio  Before the Rio Major, each major had four regional qualifiers. Each regional qualifier, called \\"Minors\\", featured eight teams per region. Because of the 14-month gap between the Rio Major and the Berlin Major, Valve revised the system into the Road to Rio. Teams competing As of September 8, 2020, Team Vitality of Europe and Renegades of Oceania are the only teams to have secured a slot, assuming no further roster changes occur in those teams. { cellspacing=\\"10\\" - ; Legends * TBD * TBD * TBD * link=North America TBD * link=North America TBD * link=North America TBD * TBD * TBD - ; Challengers * TBD * TBD * TBD * TBD * TBD * link=North America TBD * link=North America TBD * TBD - ; Contenders * TBD * TBD * link=North America TBD * TBD * TBD * TBD * TBD * Renegades - }  References  Category:2020 first-person shooter tournaments Category:Counter-Strike competitions Category:Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Majors Category:ESL One Counter-Strike competitions ","title":"ESL One Rio Major 2020"},{"id":"62559050","text":"Raphitoma farolita is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Raphitomidae.MolluscaBase (2019).

It discusses the relationship between the Earth and mankind, and how it is challenged by emerging technology. Background J√ºnger wrote An der Zeitmauer as a complement to his 1932 book The Worker. It reworks and incorporates considerations from his 1951 essay √úber die Linie, reformulating the \\"line\\" of the older essay as a \\"time wall\\". The trigger behind these considerations were the potential of new technology, notably the possibility of a doomsday scenario due to nuclear warfare or developments following James Watson's and Francis Crick's 1953 publication of the structure of the DNA molecule. For J√ºnger, this placed humanity on the trajectory toward a \\"line\\" or \\"wall\\" which, if humanity were to survive beyond it, could end modernity and its conception of \\"world history\\", prompting a different conception of time and history. Summary The first chapter \\"Fremde V√∂gel\\" (\\"Strange Birds\\") discusses an emerging global change to the Earth and humanity. The second chapter \\"Messbare und Schicksalszeit\\" (\\"Measurable and Fate Time\\") draws out a distinction between a scientific and an astrological conception of time and the world. The next chapters, \\"Humane Einteilungen\\" and \\"Siderische Einteilungen\\" (\\"Humane Classifications\\" and \\"Sidereal Classifications\\"), consider mankind and its place in cosmological contexts. The fifth and final chapter, \\"Urgrund und Person\\" (\\"Primordial Foundation and Person\\"), discusses the individual and its relationship with faith and religious institutions. Arguments Aion and Gaia with four children, Roman mosaic from the third century BC The main thesis is that mankind the Earth‚ÄîGaia‚Äîare facing a turning point. J√ºnger leaves open whether mankind will be able to make a leap over the \\"time wall\\", or if it ultimately will be repelled by the Earth. J√ºnger employs a mythic view of the situation with emerging technology such as the possibility to manipulate the human genome. He argues that Gaia's true consort is not the titanic or promethean mind of scientific progress, but the mind as a cosmic power. According to J√ºnger's philosophy of technology, the overall perceived pattern of human experience, the Gestalt, is changing. The Gestalt has previously been possible for humans to relate to, but impossible to accurately name or define, thus it has been a metaphysical concept. Technology is creating a non-metaphysical Gestalt where everything is quantified. J√ºnger believes that a fruitful unification of the two perspectives is possible. Unlike in The Worker, which relies on the nihilist conceptions of Friedrich Nietzsche and the eternal return, J√ºnger here supports a \\"spiral theory of history\\". He also criticises Oswald Spengler's study of the cycles of civilisation as insufficient, as it only points out similarities without addressing the source of the similarities. Reception Hermann Hesse reviewed the book for Stuttgarter Zeitung in 1960, and recognised in its pages his own worries about the destructive dimension of technology. Hesse wrote: \\"To what extent now J√ºnger's writings and prognoses are 'correct', or what valid points can be brought against them for this or that position, does not affect me. The dispute over this will be literature and twaddle. For me it is fully enough to have taken part of this display and spent fruitful days with it.\\" Elfriede Jelinek has called it J√ºnger's \\"intellectually perhaps most profound work\\".

Clocking in at over 15 minutes in length, it is the final song on the band's fifth studio album, Fear Inoculum. The song peaked at number 6 on the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart and was cited by critics as a standout track from the album. It later won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. Background The song was first released on August 30, 2019, with the rest of the Fear Inoculum album; while some songs had been teased or played live over the course of the 13-year wait for the album's release, \\"7empest\\" had not been revealed prior. Upon release, the song charted and peaked at number 6 on the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart. The song made its live debut at the band's Sydney performance on February 18, 2020. Composition and themes \\"7empest\\" is 15 minutes and 45 seconds in length, transitioning through many different segments, time signatures, and structures. The song opens with around 80 seconds of softer, clean guitar work before moving into a heavier, distorted guitar riff. While the guitar riffs are described as reminiscent of Lateralus or √Ünima, the vocals that kick in from Maynard James Keenan are noted for sounding aggressive similar to the bands even earlier work, kicking in with the lines \\"Keep calm...keep calm...Fuck, here we go again!\\" in the opening lines. Keenan sings through two verses of vitriolic lyrics, condemning an unnamed person with lyrics of \\"acting all surprised when you're caught in a lie/ We know better, we know your nature!\\" From there, the song enters an extended instrumental interlude, with guitarist Adam Jones going through many guitar riffs and guitar solos; with publications like Metal Hammer noting that, while many bands would build entire songs around the riffs, Tool instead runs through them once or twice and then moves on to the next one. Keenan breaks up the instrumental interludes to aggressively chant the phrase \\"A tempest must be just that\\", before the song breaks back into more instrumental interlude, including some squealing \\"Jimi Hendrix-esq solos before returning to softer, clean guitar notes reminiscent of the intro are played again as an outro. Neither Keenan, the band's primary lyricist, nor the rest of the band have shed any light on the lyrical meaning of the song, though Rolling Stone theorized that it may allude to William Shakespeare's final play The Tempest. Reception The song was singled out as the best song of the Fear Inoculum album by a number of different publications, including Esquire,Loudwire, Metal Hammer, Radio.com, MetalSucks, and Alternative Press. The song was declared the number one song of 2019 from Revolver. Esquire praised the song for fitting in the best aspects of every single one of Tool's prior studio albums, and felt the song alone made it worth the 13 year wait for the album worth it. Loudwire deemed the song \\"the greatest achievement of guitarist Adam Jones' entire career.

The genre achieved mainstream popularity in the early 1980s as a result of the \\"gourmet boom\\" associated with the Japanese bubble economy. Characteristics In Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics, author Frederik L. Schodt categorizes cooking manga as type of \\"work manga\\", a loose category defined by stories about activities and professions that stress \\"perseverance in the face of impossible odds, craftsmanship, and the quest for excellence,\\" and whose protagonists are frequently \\"young men from disadvantaged backgrounds who enter a profession and become the 'best in Japan.'\\" Individual chapters of cooking manga typically focus on a specific dish, and the steps involved in preparing it. While stories still incorporate standard narrative elements such as plot and character development, significant emphasis is frequently placed on the technical aspects of cooking and eating. Cooking manga stories often feature detailed descriptions or photorealistic illustrations of the dish itself; a recipe for the dish is often also included. Cooking manga is a multi-genre category, with cooking manga stories that center romance, crime, mystery, and numerous other genres having been produced. The age and gender of a cooking manga's protagonist typically indicates its intended audience, with both men and women forming the audience for the genre; while home food preparation is stereotyped as women's work in Japan as it is in the West, professional cooking and connoisseurship tend to be considered as male activities. Cooking manga is inclusive of stories concerning a variety of world cuisines, and is not limited to stories about Japanese cuisine exclusively. History While manga has long contained references to food and cooking, cooking manga would not emerge as a discrete genre until the 1970s. Jir≈ç Gy≈´ and J≈ç Big's ' (Ajihei the Cook), serialized in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1973 to 1977, is noted as one of the first cooking manga titles. The genre achieved mainstream popularity in the early 1980s as a result of Japan's \\"gourmet boom\\", wherein economic growth associated with the Japanese bubble economy widened access to luxury goods and caused the appreciation of fine foods, fine dining, and the culinary arts to become popular interests and hobbies. During this period, Oishinbo ( The Gourmet) was first published in the manga magazine Big Comic Spirits; the 103-volume series would become the most-circulated cooking manga of all time. To date, nearly 1,000 manga series in the cooking genre have been produced.

The mechanical goats' butting display takes place every day at 12:00 on the tower of the Pozna≈Ñ City Hall. Goats legend The goats butting heads According to one version of the folk legend, when the town hall was rebuilt after the great fire in Pozna≈Ñ, the clock for the town hall tower was ordered from master Bartholomew of Gubin. The town council decided to celebrate this important event. A great feast was planned. A young cook, Pietrek, was appointed to prepare the main dish. Deer leg baked slowly and Pietrek was curious about what the clock mechanism looks like. The young cook could not wait to finish baking and decided to leave the kitchen for a while to look at the clock. However, in his absence, the leg fell into the fire and burned to the coal. The terrified boy ran to a nearby meadow where the inhabitants of the city kept their animals. From there, he kidnapped two goats and took them to the town hall kitchen. The goats, however, escaped from the boy to the cornice of the town hall tower. There, in front of the gathered townsmen, two small white goats started butting. This sight amused the voivode and the invited guests. The mayor pardoned Pietrek, and the watchmaker was ordered to make a mechanism that would activate the clock goats every day. Since then, every day the trumpeter plays the bugle call and two buzzing goats show up. The real goats did not reach the tables of city councilors and townsmen but were returned to the poor widow, their true owner.  Goats monuments  Goats sculpture Goat sculpture is located on Collegiate Square, near the main entrance to the Municipal Office, the former Jesuit College. The sculpture was designed by Robert Soboci≈Ñski in 2002. In 2019, due to renovations of the square, the goat sculpture was moved to Chopin Park. The monument, due to its easy accessibility from the ground level and the possibility to sit on the backs of animals, is a popular place for tourists and residents to take souvenir photographs. Another, modern and colorful goat installation is located on Pi≈Çsudskiego street, in Rataje.  References   External links  * Pozna≈Ñ: The Town Hall, retrieved on 2008-06-11.

Life and work  Using installation, sculpture, drawing and pedagogical interventions, Camnitzer's work focuses on questions surrounding childhood, subject formation, and socialization. Camnitzer has said that his interest in early childhood is in parted inspired by his experience with middle ear effusion as a small child, which led to significant hearing loss and language-learning difficulties in his early life. Having worked as an elementary school teacher, Camnitzer often draws on collaborative and anti- hierarchical forms of education to engage groups in explorations of experimental knowledge forms. In 2016 Camnitzer initiated the artistic research project titled, Meaning Machine, at the Royal Institute of Art in Stockholm, focusing on the performativity of children.http://3.kkh.se/en/mejan-residents/gabo-camnitzer/ The project was supervised by the educational researcher Liselott Mariette Olsson. Other projects of Camnitzer have explored the assimilationist educational practices of charter schools in New York City (The Student Body); the problematic origins of developmental psychology (in collaboration with the architect, Llu√≠s Alexandre Casanovas Blanco); and the connection between aesthetic abstraction and epistemological abstraction (Evil Shapes). Camnitzer attended the Whitney Museum's Independent Study Program and Valand Academy, Gothenburg, Sweden, where he studied with Esther Shalev-Gerz. After graduating from Valand Academy, Camnitzer worked as an assistant to the Brazilian artist, Cildo Meireles. Camnitzer is visiting assistant professor of art at Columbia University. Camnitzer sits on the editorial board of the Sweden's oldest art journal, Paletten.

As Oma 333 label head and Stockholm based concert promoter, Gavin Maycroft describes it: ‚ÄúGabo and the Wartels started in May 2007 when Gabo Camnitzer, an artist and musician came across a family playing marching band music on the side of the street in Gothenberg. The family band was made up of a girl, Georgia (b.1995), playing bass drum, her father, Jonny Wartel (b.1959), playing sax, and her cousin, Andreas (b.1984), playing snare. Gabo approached the Wartels and proposed a collaboration. The band was formed in the basement of the Valand Academy two days later and the week after that they were on stage supporting Deerhoof.‚Äù The group went on to record several EPs and an album, touring the US and Scandinavia. They released In a Very Small Boat, on the label Oma 333 in 2013. Camnitzer also founded the band Glenn and Glenn with Markus G√∂rsch of Love Is All (band), self-releasing a record in 2010, and an EP on Swedish imprint, Zeon Light in 2013.

He conducted hundreds of tests of ships and structures using the Circulating Water Channel and the Towing Basin. A particularly important project came up during World War II. Aircraft torpedoes were not exploding on impact with Enemy ships, and the Allies were losing lots of ships to German and Japanese warships and submarines. This was particularly true at the Battle of Midway in June 1942. Bowers had to assemble a team and within a week had to design a system to impact torpedoes at 24 knots into targets at various angles and begin tests. They completed the tests and determined that the switches in the circuit were opening on impact before the signal to fire the explosive was sent. A redesigned circuit was successful and deployed throughout the Navy, and had a big impact on the war effort. After the war, Bowers led a study to design a modern, wider Panama channel that would either be sea level or high lift lock design. The study was successfully completed and Bowers won the Collingwood award for this research; ‚ÄúLaboratory Renovations.‚Äù CEGE Magazine Fall 2015: 11. Print. http://www.cege.umn.edu/news- events/magazine/pdfs/CEGEmag_2015_fall.pdf however, due to political reasons, modernization did not happen for the next 50 years. Bowers then joined the Bureau of Reclamation in Denver designing and testing spillways for Bradbury, Heart Butte and other dams. Subsequently, he joined the Saint Anthony Falls Laboratory of the University of Minnesota where he worked for the next thirty years. Oo, Pauline. (n. d.) A Stroke of Serendipity.

Bowers Faculty Teaching Award. University of Minnesota. https://www.cs.umn.edu/people/faculty/awards/bowers  Research  Bowers conducted a wide variety of studies, including testing the design for Taconite Harbor in Lake Superior. He concluded that the armor layer using 20 ton rocks was adequate and the harbor was built and has survived until today. He also concluded that the 6 ton rock design used in Silver Bay harbor would not survive the 20 foot wave that the breakwater was designed for. In 1958, two years after the Taconite Harbor breakwater was completed, a storm destroyed the Silver Bay breakwater, but the Taconite Harbor breakwater survived. His most significant research involved a study of the cause of the failure of Kaptai Dam on the Karnafuli river in Bangladesh. The river originates in the Himalaya Mountains and the dam was supposed to protect against floods during the monsoon season. The dam is 136 feet high with a 745 foot wide spillway designed for a maximum flow of 640,000 cubic feet per second (cfs). Hydraulic jumps and a stilling basin were used to dissipate the energy of the water flowing down the spillway before entering the channel and impacting the channel below the dam. The spillway failed during the first monsoon season it experienced (in 1962) at a level (123,000 cfs), far below the design flow. Bowers was in charge of analyzing the cause of the failure, and they had to determine a solution before the next monsoon season. Their steady flow analysis and tests indicated the design was correct and the spillway should have survived at the flow where it failed.Bowers, Charles E.; Tsai, Frank Y.; Kuha, Roy M.. (1964). Hydraulic Studies of The Spillway of The Karnafuli Hydroelectric Project East Pakistan. St. Anthony Falls Laboratory. Retrieved from the University of Minnesota Digital Conservancy, http://hdl.handle.net/11299/114074. Prior to this time, information was not available on the magnitude of pressure fluctuations in hydraulic jumps (used to dissipate the energy in the water flowing down the spillway) and instrumentation was not available to measure the fluctuations. Bowers had just started doing measurements on pressure fluctuations in stilling basins for their other design work, and they checked the pressure fluctuations in the stilling basin. Since the stilling basin must dissipate many millions of horsepower before the flow enters the river channel, very violent eddies are generated. These result in correspondingly high pressure fluctuations. Their test data indicate that these fluctuations could easily have caused uplift of the chute slab and subsequent failure of the spillway. This resulted in modifications to how spillways are designed, and much thicker concrete is used to withstand the dynamic fluctuations in spillways. In implementing this knowledge, dams throughout the world are now safer as a result.

It was created by the Madrid City Council in 2000, growing since then into a leading center for citizen innovation. It follows a participatory approach, using collective intelligence methods (developed in living labs) and fast prototyping tools such as fab labs, to use and co-create digital commons.  History  The Medialab-prado started in 2000 as a cultural program of the Madrid City Council within the cultural center Conde Duque. In 2002, it was named \\"Medialab Madrid\\", a space focused on the research, production and dissemination of cultural works around society, science, art and digital technologies. In 2007, it was moved to the basements of the old industrial building Serrer√≠a Belga (Belgian Sawmill), and renamed \\"Medialab-Prado\\" because of its new location next to the Prado Museum and the Paseo del Prado boulevard. This industrial building was originally built in 1920s and owned by Belgian migrants, and it remained in operation until the 2000 when it was sold to the City Council. In 2010, it received an honorary award from Prix Ars Electronica. In 2013, after an extensive refurbishment effort of the Serrer√≠a building, the center started using the 4000 m2 and all the floors of the now renovated building. This refurbishment was awarded multiple awards, including the 12th Spanish Biennial of Architecture and Town Planning award, the COAM 2013 award and the Sacyr innovation award 2014. In 2014, the City Council considered renting the building to the Telef√≥nica corporation, in order to host innovation hub initiatives such as Wayra. A manifest signed by a list of renowned names (such as Javier de la Cueva or Antonio Lafuente) supporting the center was published, and eventually the building remained for the sole use of MLP. In 2016, Medialab-prado was awarded the Princess Margriet Award by the European Cultural Foundation, for \\"developing critical spaces of social participation and political experimentation through culture\\".  Methods  Edit-a-thon \\"Wiki-witches\\" to increase women representation in Wikipedia, held in Medialab-Prado Medialab- prado states to follow these methodological principles: * Community and Mediation: it holds a cultural mediation programme with the aim to interconnect users and projects. In order to facilitate it, users may form work groups that are hosted in the space. It also provides an online platform to facilitate interaction and visibility. * Prototyping: the center focuses on experimentation, and on implementing the initial phases of new ideas. To facilitate this, it makes regular open calls for participation in collaborative prototyping workshops. * Free Culture & Commons: it promotes the use of free open source tools, all online content is published under open licenses, and all work groups must open and share their outcomes and processes. * Networks: MLP belongs to collaboration networks at both the local and international level, with the aim to share and exchange practices. Locally, it holds workshops concerning different Madrid neighbourhoods, and collaborates with different public institutions. Internationally, it has collaborated in multiple EU-funded projects and with Latin American institutions through the SEGIB Citizen Innovation programme.  Activities  Media Facade of Medialab-Prado The type of activities are pretty diverse, organized in several lines of work or \\"labs\\": * DataLab, Lab on open data, such as hosting The Glass Room by Tactical Tech and Mozilla, or the data visualization workshops Visualizar. * ParticipaLab, Lab on collective intelligence for democratic participation, such as the \\"Collective Intelligence for Democracy\\" international call. * InCiLab, Lab of citizen innovation, such as the \\"Madrid Listens\\" project, to connect City Hall officials with citizens on specific projects, and other open democracy experiments. * PrototipaLab, Lab of creative prototyping, such as a collaboration with African cultural mediators, urban art interventions, or artist residencies. * CiCiLab, Lab of citizen science, including events on scientific outreach. * AVLab, Lab of audio-video experimentation, such as innovative participatory games, or projecting documentaries on the topic. In the past, it also hosted a Commons Lab coordinated by Antonio Lafuente although its activities are now included in the other labs.  International recognition  In 2010, it received an honorary award from Prix Ars Electronica. And in 2016, it was awarded the Princess Margriet Award by the European Cultural Foundation, for \\"developing critical spaces of social participation and political experimentation through culture\\". It was the first Spanish institution that receives it. MLP has hosted multiple talks of renowned names, including major academics such as Nancy Fraser, Yochai Benkler, or Langdon Winner, or politicians such as EU Commissioner Karmenu Vella. It has also been venue of international events such as Libre Graphics Meeting, the Red Bull Music Academy, the Media Facades Festival Europe, or the Madrid Design Festival. It was due to one of Medialab-Prado events that the open hardware project Arduino reached international attention. Its Spanish co- founder, David Cuartielles, presented Arduino in the center, where Ars Electronica festival director Gerfried Stoker saw it and invited him to show it at the festival. MLP has been referred by the European Cultural Foundation as \\"cultural change-makers enacting alternatives in the face of political adversities\\", and by the UNDP as example of \\"new spaces [that] are needed for citizens and communities to access [...] digital opportunities\\". Others claim they \\"enable the creation of new and highly constructive new communities of concern around difficult topics, as well as building legitimacy for bold experimental approaches\\", that they are \\"reinventing mediation patterns\\" (Phys.org), turning Madrid into \\"an international reference of the urban commons\\" (openDemocracy), the most relevant Spanish citizen lab (El Mundo), \\"emerging institutions at the intersection of art and technology\\" (TechCrunch).

Life The son of John Pomfret of Blackburn, Lancashire, he was educated at Blackburn Grammar School. He studied at Manchester University, graduating there in 1922, and the University of Oxford. He joined the Royal Navy in 1923 as a Surgeon Lieutenant on a short service commission.Surgeon Rear Admiral A. A. Pomfret CB, OBE, MB, CHB, DO, DOMS, British Medical Journal (Clinical Research Edition) Vol. 289, No. 6454 (Nov. 10, 1984), p. 1319. Published by: BMJ After leaving the navy to concentrate on his medical training, Pomfret rejoined as a Surgeon Lieutenant in August 1926. He was one of the first naval medical officers to specialise in ophthalmology and was the first to undertake major eye surgery. Pomfret became a Surgeon Lieutenant Commander in 1929, and worked at the Royal Naval Hospital, Simon's Town from 1931 to 1934. He became a Surgeon Commander in August 1934 and in 1940 he was medical officer in charge of the Royal Navy Sick Quarters on Liugong Island, Wei Hai Wei, and in that capacity received a Japanese military delegation of the Wei Hai Wei occupying forces. Pomfret subsequently withdrew from Wei Hai Wei along with the remainder of British forces following the occupation. The following year he was made an OBE in the 1941 New Year Honours and was promoted to the rank of Surgeon Captain in June 1944. He was appointed an Honorary Surgeon to the Queen in November 1953, a capacity he served in until his retirement from active service in October 1957. Pomfret retired with the rank of Surgeon Rear- Admiral, having been promoted to that rank in October 1954. He was made a Companion to the Order of the Bath in the 1957 Birthday Honours. Pomfret retired to Taunton, where he died in April 1984. Cricket Pomfret played first-class cricket for the Royal Navy, for which he is recorded playing in 1929. His three appearances in 1929 came against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the British Army and the Royal Air Force. Against the MCC he took a five wicket haul, with figures of 6 for 39 in the MCC second-innings, which contributed to a 23 runs victory for the Royal Navy, despite having been asked to follow-on from their first-innings. A right-arm fast-medium bowler, he ended his brief first-class career with 12 wickets at an average of 24.25. Family Pomfret married in 1928 Carlene Blundstone: they had a son and two daughters. Their daughter Jocelyn married Alexander Crawford Simpson Boswell in 1956. Carlene Pomfret's memoir Cabin Trunks & Far Horizons was published in 1991.

It is located along Murtala Mohammed way, besides federal medical centre in Lokoja, the colonial Nigeria administrative center and headquarters of the Royal Niger Company. The cenotaph was conceived in 1995, under the former ministry of health and social services, Kogi State during the regime of Colonel Paul Omeruo, the previous military administrator of the state. This cenotaph is a war memorial, built in memory of the British and Nigerian officers, as well as other ranks. This is specific to the pack, who lost their lives in the world wars. The war memorial, a gigantic concrete block with old artillery mounted on it, is situated in the middle of light cannons and machine guns placed on small pavements. It exhibits relics of weapons employed by the British forces against the German forces in defence of their colonies in East Africa and Cameroon. This is clearly implied by the year, 1914 Cameroon and 1918 East African wars boldly written on the remnants of the cannon on display.The displayed cannons signify disparity between the technology of the old era and present day military weaponry and warfare. The cenotaph has a measurement of 16.8 √ó 50 meters. Another spectacular feature of the cenotaph is an inscription of the names of eminent military personnel who served in the two world wars. This is found on tables laid on the side of the cenotaph. In other words, a memento of three heavy artillery guns is seen with names of exceptional soldiers engraved on a plaque and placed on the huge concrete block accommodating one of the artilleries. The attributes of this monument have made it a designated place where government functionaries and Nigerian soldiers in Kogi state mark the yearly army remembrance day every 15th of January, in honour of their dead heroes. Hence, it is usually relatively taken care of and always repainted. The cenotaph witnessed the memorial of the 2020 Armed forces remembrance day celebration on Wednesday, 15 January. The governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, flanked by top service personnel representative of retired service men and the Ohinoyi of Ebiraland, Dr. Ado Ibrahim CON, laid wreaths in honour and remembrance of the nation's fallen heroes. This respect was extended with a pledge by the governor's administration to provide maximum support to the families of all fallen servicemen in the state. This was preceded by the inspection of the Guard of Honour, signing the Hard Book, and releasing the white pigeons, by the governor, which symbolises existing national peace.

Starting as a prison cell robbery, violence between prison gangs intensified into a full-blown riot leading to the death of seven prisoners. It was the most violent prison riot in the United States within the last 25 years. As of 2020, no criminal charges have been filed in regard to the prisoner deaths.  The riot  Lee Correctional is the largest prison for males in the state of South Carolina. It was built in the 1990s as a high-security prison. The campus is split into two yards, the East and the West. The East Yard is considered less problematic and includes the character-based dorm where prisoners have less restrictions. The West Yard consists of the F-1, F-3, and F-5 housing units and is generally seen as the more dangerous of the two yards. The prison has issues with three prison gangs: the Bloods, the Gangster Disciples, and the Crips. The Bloods make-up the largest share of the prison population which has led to the Gangster Disciples and the Crips occasionally working together. The riot started in the F-3 housing unit and spread from there. The riot began after prisoner Michael Milledge was fatally stabbed during a prison cell robbery in the F-3 Housing unit near the unit's common area called \\"the Rock.\\" The assailant, Damonte Rivera, was a member of the Disciples. Rivera was confronted by a member of the Bloods and was fatally stabbed in the neck. This event led to weaponized prisoners rushing to the Rock while other prisoners fled to their prison cells. Violence escalated past the F-3 Unit and into subsequent prison wings. Some prisoners affiliated with the Gangster Disciples and the Crips sought Raymond Scott, a high-ranking Blood staying in the F-5 unit. Scott and inmate Joshua Jenkins were murdered as they attempted to flee knife-wielding inmates near the prison's gate. After the killing of Raymond Scott, violence spread to the F-1 housing unit, the closest unit to the prison's administrative building. Members of the Crips living in F-1 were targeted in retribution for the murder of Scott. The Lee Correctional Prison riot was the most violet riot in the United States within the last 25 years. In its aftermath, prison officials sent 48 prisoners to a private prison in Mississippi. But, thus far, no charges have been filed in regards to the seven inmate deaths.

Injuries occur commonly after automobile- or sports-related accidents. A blunt force is involved in 80-85% of injuries to the kidney. Major decelerations can result in major vascular injuries near the kidney's hilum. Gunshots and knife wounds commonly are the cause of penetrating injuries. Fractured ribs can result in penetrating injuries to the kidney. Injuries to the urethra occur most commonly in men after pelvic fractures or straddle-type falls. Presentation Comorbidity In 90% of bladder injuries there is a concurrent pelvic fractures. Pelvic bone fragments penetrate and perforate the bladder. Perforations can be either extraperitoneal or intraperitoneal. Intraperitoneal perforations allow for urine to enter the peritoneal cavity. Symptoms typically develop immediately if the urine is infected. Otherwise sterile urine may take days to cause symptoms.  Diagnosis   Hematuria in Patients Presenting After Trauma  Blood in the urine after abdominal trauma suggests a urinary tract injury. Renal injuries are suggested by lower rib fractures. Bladder and urethral injuries are suggested by pelvic fractures. = Foley Catheter = The urethral meatus should be examined after trauma. Blood at the urethral meatus precludes insertion of a foley catheter into the bladder. Erroneously placing a foley in this situation can result in infections of periprostatic and perivesical hematomas or conversion of a partial transection to a complete urethral transections. Blood at the urethral meatus suggests an injury to the urethra. Otherwise a foley catheter can be placed into the bladder and hematuria can be assessed for. = Abdominal Imaging = Hemodynamically-stable individuals should undergo further radiographic assessment. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) with contrast can detect retroperitoneal hematomas, renal lacerations, urinary extravasation, and renal arterial and venous injuries. A repeat scan ten minutes after the first is recommended. = Retrograde Urethrography (RUG) = The purpose of this study is to identify and characterize injuries to the urethra. The tip of a small (12F) foley catheter is placed in the urethral meatus. The catheter remains fixed after 3 mL of water are instilled into the foley catheter's balloon. Radiographic films are taken as 20 mL of water- soluble contrast material are injected This outlines the urethra from the urethral meatus to the bladder neck. If injuries exist, the location can be determined. = Retrograde Cystography = The purpose of this study is to identify bladder perforations. The bladder needs to be adequately distended with contrast medium. 300 mL or more are generally recommended. The study has two films. One film is taken when the bladder is adequately distended and filled with contrast. The next film is taken after the bladder is emptied without the assistance of a foley catheter. = Angiography = Helpful in identifying injuries to the kidney's parenchyma and vasculature.  Management   Genitourinary Trauma  = Urethral Injuries = Management depends on what part of the urethra was injured and to what extent. The two broad anatomical separations are the posterior and anterior urethra. The posterior urethra includes the prostatic and membranous urethra. The anterior urethra includes the bulbous and pendulous portion.  Posterior Urethra Injuries  The membranous urethra can be separated from the prostate's apex after blunt trauma. The urethra should not be catheterized. Initial management should be the creation of a suprapubic cystostomy for urine drainage. The bladder should be opened in the midline so to facilitate inspection of bladder lacerations. Perforations can be closed with absorbable sutures. The suprapubic cystostomy remains in place for three months. Incomplete urethral disruptions heal spontaneously and the suprapubic cystostomy can be removed after three weeks for these injuries. Before removing a cystostomy, a voiding cystourethrography should demonstrate no urine extravasation. Delayed urethral reconstruction may be performed within 3 months. This typically entails a direct excision of the now strictured area and anastomosis of the bulbous urethra to the prostate's apex. A urethral catheter and suprapubic cystostomy should be left in place. These are removed within a month.

In a Mass start event only 30 athletes are allowed to participate and the points awarded for ranks 22 to 30 differ from the system used in other events. Equal placings (ties) give an equal number of points. An athlete's total World Cup Score is the sum of all World Cup points earned in the season, minus the points from 2 events in which the athlete got their worst scores. Ties in this score are broken by comparing the tied athletes' number of victories. If this number is the same for the athletes in question, the number of second places is compared, and so on.

It is the first video game based on the cartoon of the same name, and was released in the United States and Europe, for Amiga, Atari ST and Commodore 64 (C64) computers. Another game with identical gameplay, Tom & Jerry 2, was released in Europe later in 1989. Tom & Jerry 2, also by Magic Bytes, was published for the same systems as the original game, plus the MSX, Amstrad CPC and Sinclair ZX Spectrum . Gameplay Tom & Jerry is a platform game. Playing as Jerry, a mouse, the player travels around five rooms in a house to search for cheese. The player has a time limit to consume all the cheese and must also evade Tom, a cat who wants to harm Jerry. If Tom grabs Jerry, the player loses 30 seconds of time. The player loses if the time limit runs out before all the cheese can be consumed. As in the cartoon, Jerry can use a variety of items against Tom. This includes bowling balls and vases that can be dropped on Tom's head from a shelf, and banana peels which can be laid on the floor for Tom to slip. Reaching a shelf requires the player to jump on a sofa, propelling Jerry into the air. The player can also activate a radio or television to distract Tom. To evade Tom, the player can also enter mouse holes which lead Jerry through tunnels, played as a continuously scrolling sub-game. While in the tunnels, the player must evade bombs that are thrown inside by Tom. The player can also collect cheese in the tunnels to restore lost time. The tunnels connect to each room in the house. Reception Several critics declared the game a disappointment, and Andy Smith of ACE stated that fans of the cartoon would be disappointed with the game as well. Tom & Jerry received praise for its graphics, particularly on the Amiga, while reviewers for Zzap!64 found the C64 version to be graphically superior. The Games Machine considered the C64 version to be the worst, criticizing the \\"bright garish backdrops\\" and stating that Jerry is depicted as being nearly as big as Tom. Amiga User International (AUI) was critical of the graphics and sound. Some critics stated that the Amiga version had superior music over the C64 version, although Mark Heley of CU Amiga-64 opined that the Amiga version contained a poor imitation of the Tom & Jerry theme music. The gameplay was criticized by reviewers who found it to be boring and repetitive. Gordon Hamlett of Your Amiga stated \\"there isn't actually any point to the game and I mean that quite literally. There is no scoring at all involved so you never know how well you have done.\\" AUI criticized the \\"weak game design\\". The sluggish controls were also criticized. Tom Malcom of .info wrote that trying to move Jerry \\"is like trying to swim through Jello: it can be done but it's more hard work than fun.\\" Smith described the game as being nearly unplayable. Heley described the gameplay as a bad combination of \\"very dull\\" and \\"very difficult.\\" Tom & Jerry 2 received criticism for reusing elements from the original game. Carsten Borgmeier of Amiga Joker criticized the lack of improved control, and considered the sequel to be a clone of the original.

APV was founded in 1953 as a speciality football club ‚Äì tradition holds that it was the first specialty football club to be founded in rural Finland ‚Äì but expanded to include other sports over time. The club now offers programs in football, futsal, ice hockey, and pes√§pallo and is best known for its youth and junior teams. APV‚Äôs representative ice hockey teams play in the men‚Äôs fourth-tier II-divisioona and in the women‚Äôs second-tier Naisten Mestis. The club‚Äôs representative men‚Äôs pes√§pallo team plays in the Suomensarja (Finnish League), the third-tier league below the Superpesis and Ykk√∂spesis.  History  Football spread to Alavus and the surrounding countryside from the urban centers of Vaasa and Tampere. The new sport was first practiced in Alavus at the Jokivarren School in 1908. By the 1940s the game was established in the region, where informal games were played in pastures and hayfields. Alavuden Urheilijat (Alavus Athletes) was the first club in Alavus to organize a football division under its sports department and the first official games in Alavus were played in 1947. Early on, there was interest amongst footballers to create a specialty club but the project was delayed by economic issues. However, plans to establish a club began to materialize when the municipality of Alavus gained ownership of the central sports field. The founding meeting for Alavuden Peli-Veikot was held at 1 pm on 19 April 1953 in the Kynt√§j√§n Cooperative. Armas Korpela, football chairman of the Alavuden Urheilijat at that time, was integral to the success of the founding meeting. With newspaper announcements and posters, he invited alumnus football players to attend ‚Äúin large numbers.‚Äù The meeting minutes officially recorded 22 people in attendance but contemporary accounts describe a crowd that extended down the stairs to the front door. The Football Association of Finland was represented by Anselm Anttila, in whom APV found a stalwart supporter. Alavuden Urheilijat ry donated all of their kits, balls, and equipment to the newly created club. Alavuden Peli-Veikot was granted membership to the Football Association of Finland on 18 May 1953 and the club was registered on 14 September 1953. Early on, APV supported a project to establish a skating rink in Alavus. The project was funded and supported entirely from community donations, the municipality did not provide any grants to the initial construction or maintenance. Donations of note included an initial monetary donation made by Urmas Sepp√§ with his wife and pharmacist Hannes Leinonen, some lumber donated by Mr. Hakkola of Hakkola Sawmill in Tuuri, and the efforts of Nepa Sinkkonen, who transformed an old truck engine into a water pump to spray water through an attached hose and resurface the ice. Unfortunately, operating the ice rink became unsustainable after several years and the project was ended.  Ice hockey  Ice hockey was officially included in APV‚Äôs program in 1964. Alavus Areena serves as home ice for the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs representative teams. The arena was completed in 2008 and can seat 421 spectators. The men‚Äôs representative team plays in the Keskimaan lohko (Central Division) of the II- divisoona. The team won the regional championship in the 2012‚Äì13 season and progressed to the Suomi-sarja qualifiers (karsinta), however, they did not earn promotion at that time. In December 2019, the women‚Äôs representative team gained promotion to the Alempi jatkosarja (Lower Division) of the Naisten Liiga from the Ristiinkarsinta (Cross-qualifiers) of the Naisten Mestis. The promotion marked the team‚Äôs first return to the top-tier Naisten Liiga since the 2009‚Äì10 season. APV was relegated in the Karsintasarja (Qualification series) in March of the 2019‚Äì20 Naisten Liiga season. APV‚Äôs junior program is well regarded and has produced such players as K√§rp√§t forward and Olympic medalist Saila Saari, goaltender Pekka Tuokkola, coach Tuomas Tuokkola, and defenceman Lauri Taipalus. Rally driver Jari-Matti Latvala played junior hockey at APV.

It was developed using the Unity engine and supports all PC-compatible VR headsets. It was released on Windows on December 10, 2019, sold on Steam. On February 20, 2020, it was released on the Oculus VR store with a temporarily exclusive sandbox level.  Gameplay  Boneworks revolves around having realistic guns and a complicated physics system. In the game, the player must escape and battle their way out of a virtual city, revolving around realistic physics interactions. All objects in the world can be manipulated by the player according to the object's real-life size and weight. Small objects like cups or hammers can be easily picked up one-handed while larger objects like crates or axes take more effort to be picked up. Weapons in Boneworks are very physical, with manual weapon reloading and hefty melee action to replicate how much effort the action would take in real life. Players can also pick up small enemies and throw them or bash them into a wall; enemies can be simultaneously grabbed and shot. Levels in the game have many ways of accomplishing them, such as stacking boxes together or climbing a ledge. The game encourages all ways of completing puzzles, even if it means cheating or solving them in an unintended way.  Plot  Boneworks starts in an introductory tour designed as a history of VR interaction. The player plays as Arthur Ford, the head of security for a fictional company named Monogon. The story mode of the game has the player traversing a digital city developed by Monogon, called MythOS City. MythOS City is built upon the advanced framework engine Boneworks and is sustained by the artificial intelligence operating system, MythOS. The virtual world is built upon \\"void energy\\", an unstable, yet very useful energy, recently discovered by the same company. It is Arthur's mission to reset the system clock as the city is on lockdown. Along the way, he fights rogue AI enemies and holographic soldiers. It is implied that the lockdown was caused by Arthur in a beginning cutscene by using a virus hard drive from a rival company called Gammon. Boneworks is said to have a very complicated story, and still has connections to Stress Level Zero's previous video game, Duck Season.  Development  Boneworks was shown in a tech demo in 2018, and the game reached a playable, completable state in October 2019, and was released on Steam on December 10, 2019. On February 20, 2020, it was released on the Oculus VR Store, with a temporarily exclusive level.  Reception  The game has been compared to Half-Life in its aesthetics and puzzles. The game was praised for its developers having created an \\"incredible engine for a captivating VR adventure\\", and has been called \\"one of the best VR gun-adventure games on the market\\". Physics manipulation in Boneworks has been described as entering the \\"uncanny valley\\". The game has been criticized for its bugs, where the player's limbs can become stuck in game objects, as well as the content not being paced well and a lack of a good plot. It has been described as a \\"VR physics playground\\". The game has been described as being \\"conceived as a combat showcase first and a story-driven epic second ‚Äì the Narbacular Drop to Valve's Portal.\\" On the release day of Boneworks, it reached the top of Steam's top-selling and top 100 player count lists of that day. The game was nominated for \\"Best VR/AR Game\\" at the Game Developers Choice Awards.

She graduated from Kaohsiung Municipal Kaohsiung Girls' Senior High School. She was a witness to the February 28 incident in 1947 which killed thousands in Taiwan and resulted in decades of martial law known as the White Terror. During this time, she chose to focus on the study of physics. She attended the University of Tokyo and was awarded a doctorate in physics in 1966. She returned to Taiwan in 1970 and was asked to create a physics department at Soowchow University. She married another academic, Feng Tsuan Hua, around 1972 and they left for a couple of years to work in Massachusetts in the United States at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. She became a professor of physics at the National Taiwan University. From 1981 to 1983 she was the head of the department of physics at the university. As of 2019 she is the only woman to hold this role.

This vascular disease is induced by the fungal pathogen known by its teleomorph Gibberella xylarioides (Fusarium xylarioides). In 1927 coffee wilt disease was first observed in the Central African Republic where it developed slowly and went on to cause two epidemics between the 1930s and the 1960s. Coffee wilt disease was first seen in Coffea excelsa.  Host  Hosts of coffee wilt disease include Coffea arabica (Arabica coffee), Coffea canephora (Robusta coffee), Coffea liberica (Liberian coffee), and Coffea excelsa (Excelsa coffee) Currently, the disease is limited to Eastern and Central Africa, however, studies have shown that most Coffea species are likely to be susceptible to the disease, which can potentially lead to more worldwide problems in the coffee industry. Robusta coffee tree infected by coffee wilt disease, credit The Mediae Company  Symptoms and signs  Due to the nature of coffee wilt disease, coffee plants often exhibit symptoms of disruption to vascular systems. Internal symptoms are disturbances to conduction of water in the plant. External symptoms include loss of moisture on leaves, discoloration, leaf loss, dieback of the infected region, swelling of trunks, cracks in mature trees and lastly plant death. Signs of coffee wilt disease include small blackish-brown perithecia caused by the sexual stage of the fungus, and cracks in the bark which cause an observable bluish-black stain on the wood.  Disease cycle  The fungal pathogen responsible for coffee wilt disease can exist on coffee trees as Gibberella xylarioides, the sexual or perfect stage, or as Fusarium xylarioides, the asexual or imperfect stage. Coffee wilt disease is spread by wind-born ascospores during its sexual stage or splash-borne conidia, where they land and can persist as a viable source of inoculum in the soil. Infection occurs via penetration of wounds at the base of stems, mainly by the imperfect stage Fusarium xylarioides. Once the plant is infected, the fungus blocks the xylem system, which induces host responses that inevitably result in plant death.  Importance  Coffee is a major cash crop, with over 2.5 million people directly depending on its production and trade as a livelihood. For some countries, coffee accounts for 50% of primary foreign exchange, valued around 300‚Äì400 million dollars annually. Reduced coffee production causes decline of revenue for some African countries, which can also increase food insecurity and overall regression at grassroot level. In 1945 coffee wilt disease destroyed most of Central Africa Republic's Excelsa plantations, resulting in the complete collapse of the crop. This disease causes a threat for coffee growers around the globe as the disease reduces the quantity and quality of the coffee. Not only does this disease put an economic strain on countries that use coffee as a cash crop, but it also can lead to the rise of coffee prices for consumers everywhere.  Management  Once a coffee plant is infected by coffee wilt disease, death is inevitable, making prevention the most beneficial for coffee growers. Diagnosis of coffee wilt disease can be made by observing a blue-black staining after bark scraping. Additionally, regular root inspections are an effective measure to catch the disease in the early stages. Once disease is found, destruction of the coffee plant by cutting it at the ground level and burning it stops the spread of the infection to other plants. Restriction of movement for coffee plant, coffee husks mulch and planting materials are also useful. Relocation of coffee production or replanting of resistant C. canephora germplasm, assist with combating future spread. Preventive measures for coffee wilt disease infection are to avoid wounding of trees for example when removing control weeds, fertilizing soil or by grazing of any animals. Additionally, maintaining plants‚Äô health by using inorganic fertilizer, manure or mulch to conserve moisture are some ways to decrease the risk of coffee wilt disease.

Black rot targets a variety of orchids but Cattleya orchids are especially susceptible. Pythium ultimum and Phytophthora cactorum are known to cause black rot in orchids. Pythium ultimum is a pathogen that causes damping-off and root rot on plants. Symptoms of this pathogen include stunting and chlorosis. Identifying Pythium ultimum has traditionally been done by examining oogonia, antheridia, and sporangium structure. Now, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) technology can identify the pathogen using DNA fragments. Phytophthora cactorum is a pathogen that causes root rot on many plant species. Symptoms of this pathogen include necrosis in the roots, chlorosis, and wilting. Phytophthora cactorum can be identified by examining oogonia, antheridium, oospore, and sporangia structure. Disease cycle Phytophthora cactorum P. cactorum requires free water to reproduce. Zoospores are released from sporangium and blown via wind or rain splash and use free water on the leaf to germinate. An appressorium is formed and a penetration peg penetrates the leaf surface. From there, hyphae grow throughout the leaf and infects all plant tissues. While this pathogen enters through the leaf, the disease is caused by root rot that causes symptoms of foliar blight. The mycelium gives rise to chlamydospores and oospores. Oospores produce mycelium that produce sporangia. Oospores are the survival structure of P. cactorum. Chlamydospores produce mycelium that continues to infect the plant. Pythium ultimum P. ultimum requires moist conditions to germinate. When conditions are favorable, surviving oospores in the soil produce a sporangia and zoospores which facilitate infection via germ tube. From there, mycelium will grow throughout all plant tissues. The disease is primarily a root rot that causes symptoms of foliar blight. Sporangia are produced on the mycelium and can produce zoospores for asexual reproduction or an oogonium and antheridium for sexual reproduction. Once the oogonium is fertilized, the oospore either infects via germ tube or produces sporangia and zoospores. Environmental conditions Pythium ultimum Pythium species rely on moist soils and cool conditions. Moist conditions allow the movement of zoospores which infect the plant. From here, the fungus penetrates the leaf surface and mycelial growth takes over the plant. Phytophthora cactorum Phytophthora species thrive in moist soils. When there is free water in the soil, conditions are met for sporangia to be produced. As the disease cycle mentioned, sporangia produce zoospores which are infectious. Spring and autumn also produce temperatures that are most favorable for zoospore production. Control and management Avoiding black rot in orchids is challenging. Avoiding symptomatic plants and isolating new plants from larger populations is helpful. In addition, decontaminating pots, tools, and work surfaces ensures that there are no contamination that could infect healthy plants. Potting media should also be sterilized as spores and hyphae can survive in dust or free water. Being careful not to over water, providing good drainage, air circulation, and proper potting media are helpful to prevent zoospores from having an optimal environment to move and infect. Fungicides are also used. The primary fungicide treatments to control black rot are metalaxyl, fosetyl-AI, and etridiazole that are sprayed onto the plant. Poultices such as copper sulfate and lime or cinnamon can also be useful fungicides.

Symptoms  The symptoms of Drechslera leaf spot are mostly small, dark-brown, or purplish spots on the leaves.Drechslera Leaf Spot. (n.d.). Ithaca. http://plantclinic.cornell.edu/factsheets/drechsleraleafspot.pdf The spots eventually expand and become lighter-brown or ashy in the middle (usually having dark margins around the center). Once the spots run together, girdling of the entire leaf blade occurs. Warm weather induces crown rot and eventual wilt will occur from the root destruction.Nanswa, R., Gordora, S. L., & Singh, M. (2018). International Journal of Current Microbiology and Applied Sciences, 7, 1‚Äì5.  Disease cycle  The disease cycle starts with fungi overwintering in leaf and plant clippings/debris of infected grass plants. Spores are produced and can be dispersed through wind and rain splash, machines, and many other mechanisms, although clippings and debris are the main source of the inoculum.Dicklow, B. (2016, October 26). Leaf Spot Diseases of Turf. Retrieved from https://ag.umass.edu/turf/fact-sheets/leaf-spot-diseases-of-turf. Spores germinate with free moisture on the leaf and eventually infect to form lesions (mainly in spring and autumn). The disease severity is dependent on weather, wetter and warmer weather is usually favorable to the pathogen.Smith, C. (n.d.). Pest Fact Sheet 42. New Hampshire. Dry weather in the summer reduces the ability of infection and crown rot begins. This causes a reduction in vigor and drought tolerance, eventually leading to the grass ‚Äúmelting out‚Äù (yellowing of the host) and dying.  Management  There are many ways to try and manage Drechslera leaf spot. The most favorable would be to find a resistant plant variety. Other ways include collecting fallen leaves in order to reduce inoculum from plant debris, as well as pruning to increase air circulation for the grasses (a reduction in moisture is unfavorable to the pathogen).Fungal spots, blights, and blotches. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/help-for- the-home-gardener/advice-tips-resources/pests-and-problems/diseases/fungal- spots.aspx. Another important factor to consider is when to handle the plants. They should not be handled when the foliage is wet and it is advised to avoid overhead watering.Identification and Management of Turfgrass Diseases. (2007, June). Retrieved from http://extension.missouri.edu/publications/DisplayPrinterFriendlyPub.aspx?P=IPM1029-9. Fertilizing on the basis of a soil test may also improve and maintain the vigor of the plants. Fungicides may be applied, but they should be applied before the first sign of infection and continued through the susceptible period. This may be harder and less ideal for farmers to implement.

They are a members of the Asia League Ice Hockey and play their home games at the Kushiro Ice Arena. History The East Hokkaido Cranes formed in April 2019, as a phoenix club following the demise of the Nippon Paper Cranes franchise. The Paper Cranes had previously existed for 70 years; however, their owners, Nippon Paper Industries, announced in December 2018 that the team would be put up for sale as a result of corporate streamlining and declining revenues. No buyer was found, and as a result the team folded. The East Hokkaido Ice Hockey Club LLC, led by Tanaka Shigeki, announced that they had secured ¬•125 million of founding, enabling the establishment of the new team. Asia League Ice Hockey chairman Sumio Kobayashi announced on 23 April 2019 that the new franchise would join the league, replacing the Paper Cranes, whilst retaining 15 players and playing out of the same arena. The Cranes played their first regular season game on 31 August 2019, losing 3‚Äì2 to the Nikk≈ç Ice Bucks, with forward Taiga Irikura scoring the first goal in franchise history.

She independently released an extended play and studio album before signing a record deal with indie label Reviver Records in 2018. Her first album for the label, Love, Heartbreak, & Everything in Between, was released in January 2020. Arts was nominated for the Discovery Artist Award by the Canadian Country Music Association in 2016 and has received multiple awards from the subsidiary Saskatchewan Country Music Association.  Biography  Arts was raised in her hometown of Weyburn, Saskatchewan, where she began taking lessons in piano and singing, and developed an interest in songwriting in her teenage years. By 2009, she began posting videos of her cover versions of popular songs, including one of Taylor Swift's \\"Fifteen\\" that captured the attention of a talent manager from Nashville, Tennessee. Arts briefly relocated to Nashville to pursue this opportunity, but returned to Canada to finish high school. In 2015, she relocated to Nashville to sign a publishing contract with Noble Vision Music Group and released \\"Breathe\\", a charity single in support of Cystic Fibrosis research. She was awarded the Emerging Artists Award from the Saskatchewan Country Music Association and was nominated for the Discovery Artist program from the Canadian Country Music Association, both in 2016, for her burgeoning success. That year, she released her debut, self-titled extended play through the independent label imprint 19th & Grand Records. \\"What He's Into\\" was released to Canadian country radio in January 2017 as her official debut single and reached 47 on the Canada Country airplay chart. Following the success of that record, Arts released her debut studio album, Rebel Child, on October 27, 2017, preceded by the single, \\"Cold Feet\\". The album reached number 45 on the sales component chart of the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. In 2018, Arts made an appearance on the 22nd season of popular American reality television series, The Bachelor, performing an original ballad titled, \\"Moment of Weakness\\" and in 2020 performing ‚ÄúSomebody Like That‚Äù. Exposure from the show led to increased interest in Arts's music and a record deal from indie label Reviver Records, which she signed in March 2018. A deluxe edition of Rebel Child was issued that year with new tracks including \\"Moment of Weakness\\". Her first release for Reviver, \\"I Hate This\\", was released in the summer of 2018 and charted on the Hot Country Songs in the United States. A Canadian-exclusive single, \\"Mad Crazy Love\\", became Arts's second single to reach the Canadian country airplay charts. Two further singles were released in 2019 - \\"Call You Names\\" and \\"Somebody Like That\\" - to promote her second studio album, Love, Heartbreak, & Everything in Between, which is scheduled for release January 10, 2020.

Being a municipal event, the tournament was held at either city-owned Enger Park Golf Course or Lester Park Golf Course. Like the U.S. Amateur Public Links Championship and the Minnesota State Public Links Championship, the Duluth Publinx was closed to golfers with playing privileges at a golf club not open to the general public. The first Duluth Publinx tournament was held over Labor Day weekend in September of 1927 at Enger Park Golf Course and sponsored by the Duluth Municipal Amateur Athletic Association. Enger had opened just weeks earlier on July 2nd and was at the time a nine-hole course. Against 21 other competitors, Oscar Erickson was the first winner of the tournament shooting rounds of 87 and 86 for a total score of 173 over 36 holes. Fourteen year-old Bobby Campbell finished in fifth place. By 1931, Campbell was one of the best golfers in the state winning two Minnesota state amateur titles among his many tournament wins during the 1930s before quitting the game at the start of World War II. Newspaper accounts do not reflect on the details behind the high scores shot during the tournament (Erickson was a Minnesota State Amateur Championship contender in 1930) but one can speculate that the course was probably still immature with construction having begun just a year before. Oscar Erickson would not defend his title in 1928 having joined the private Ridgeview County Club and becoming ineligible to compete. Wally Johnson became the first to capture the Duluth Public Links title three times. With his third win, Johnson was awarded permanent possession of the original loving cup trophy. Months after his 1941 Duluth Publinx victory, Johnson joined the U.S. Air Corps after Pearl Harbor and was killed in action at the age of 27 in June of 1943 in the Pacific Theater. The Duluth News-Tribune and the Duluth Herald sponsored a replacement trophy for the tournament which was retired in 1952 after Bob Braff had won the tournament for a third time. In 1958, Glenn Wicklund equaled the feat and retired that trophy by capturing his third Public Links title. The Duluth City Public Links Golf Tournament was considered for many years one of the more prestigious tournaments for Duluth-area golfers. However, by the late fifties, the tournament had seen lagging interest. In response, a major change was introduced which allowed golfers with membership at a private club to compete for the Public Links title. The immediate result was an increase in participation with Dave Vosika of Ridgeview Country Club and Leo Spooner of Northland Country Club winning titles from 1960-1962. But, with the inclusion of private course golfers, the tournament distinctiveness was lost and the title of public course champion was distorted. In 1963, North Lakes Golf Association (NLGA) officials decided to merge the Duluth City Public Links and the Duluth All-City Golf Tournament into one large event to be known as the All-City Championships. NLGA officials hoped that one big tournament open to all golfers regardless of club membership or skill would stimulate public interest and renew participant interest. The All-City Championships were never held; the NLGA never got it organized. The Duluth All-City Golf Tournament lingered on for another year. However, the Duluth City Public Links Golf Tournament was abandoned after a 36 year-run and, with its demise, ended the oldest and longest running consecutively-held golf tournament in the city of Duluth at the time.

Preparation  Barium carbide was first synthesized as an impure compound in the Soviet Union in 1986 by reducing Barium carbonate powder with metallic Magnesium in the presence of Carbon-14. It can also be prepared by heating a Barium amalgam and Carbon powder mixture in a Hydrogen current. The pure compound is prepared by reducing Barium oxide with Carbon at a high temperature.  Properties  Barium carbide reacts similarly to Calcium carbide, but it's more fusible. When exposed to extreme heat, the Barium will evaporate leaving behind crystals of Graphite. It can also absorb the Carbon in a solution at high temperatures.

Few homes in Salvador had private water facilities; entire neighborhoods relied on a single fountain. Alberto Her√°clito Ferreira Filho described the public fountains of the colonial period as \\"noisy places frequented hundreds of people, with the water-bearers, the washerwomen, and their young children.\\" Domingos Rabelo described the fountain on a report of the parish of Santo Antonio Alem do Carmo in 1829. Dom Pedro II and the Empress visited the fountain in 1859. The Companhia do Queimado, a utility company and dam created by the state of Bahia in the mid-19th century, is unrelated to the fountain. The fountain was restored in 1992 under the direction of the architect Paulo Ormindo de Azevedo. Structure The Queimado Fountain has a simple fa√ßade of white rectangular tiles with a triangular pediment. A stone pinnacle with the figure of a pelican is located above the pediment, and stone urns to the left and right. A plaque reading \\"Quemado, Camara Municipal, 1838\\" is placed at center. The fountain is accessed by stone steps and surrounded by an iron fence, both dating to the 20th century. Plaques referring to restoration of the fountain were placed on a wall to the left of the fountain. Access and condition The Queimado Fountain is accessible from the Largo do Queimado below the Church and Convent of Our Lady of Solitude. It is in poor condition and lacks security. The fountain is used as a source of water for a carwash and the site is frequented by drug users. Protected status The Queimado Fountain was listed as a historic structure by the State of Bahia via the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1984 under decree number 30.483/84.

Personal life  She was born on the Isle of Wight and went to Cowes High School and now lives in London with her fianc√© who she met on Mamma Mia. She has one sister who trained as a ballerina at the Royal Ballet School and runs her own dance school.  Theatre career  Carolyn trained at Elmhurst School of Dance and Performing Arts (formerly known as Elmhurst Ballet School). Carolyn started her career as an Actor and dancer for Reach for the Moon for LWT and a backing dancer for the MOBO Awards in 2002 for ITV before working with the late Brian Rogers on Broadway Christmas Spectacular. She joined Spirit of the Dance/Broadway in 2003 for 2 years before becoming lead vocalist on the QE2 for Belinda King Productions. In 2007 she joined the International tour of Mamma Mia. The following year she was offered the roles of 1st Cover Mabel (she had to wear a fat suit for this role), 2nd Cover Serena, Miss Bell & Swing on the UK tour of FAME. She was given her first lead understudy on the tour of High School Musical 2 as Gabriella. 2010 consisted mainly of cabarets and workshops until late in the year when she was offered her second lead understudy role as Lucy Harris in the musical Jekyll and Hyde produced by Bill Kenwright. She played opposite Marti Pellow from the 90's band Wet, Wet, Wet. In 2012 she debuted her first West End show understudying the roles of Vivienne and Serena in Legally Blonde at the Savoy Theatre. The following year she understudied Hannah Waddingham in the role of Lilli Vanessi/Katherine in Chichester Festival Theatre's 2012 revival of Kiss Me, Kate directed by Sir Trevor Nunn at The Old Vic. That led to creating the role of Rose and understudying Rebecca Thornhill in the role of Karen Holmes in From Here to Eternity at the Shaftesbury Theatre, London in 2013. In May 2014 Carolyn was to understudy Tamsin Carroll as Ellen Scott in the anticipated West End revival of Miss Saigon, produced by Cameron Mackintosh and directed by Laurence Connor. Carolyn was directed as Ellen by Claude-Michel Sch√∂nberg, Alain Boublil and Cameron Mackintosh three days before opening night when Miss Carroll became sick and couldn't perform. Miss Carroll recovered in time for opening night. In 2015 Maitland starred in her first lead as Kathy Selden in Singin‚Äô in the Rain at Kilworth House Theatre directed by Mitch Sebastian. Later that year she was to return to Miss Saigon as Ellen Scott. She went on to star as Sally Bowles in Cabaret at ACT Aberdeen and the Daughter in The Memory Show at The Drayton Theatre. Groundhog Day premiered in London in 2016 at The Old Vic in London where Carolyn created the role of Joelle and understudied the part of Rita Hanson. In January 2017 Carolyn was cast to play alternate Alice and Mad Hatter in Wonderland: A New Alice. Maitland pulled out before rehearsals due to disagreements with the producer and the production company Wonderland the Musical Ltd regarding her contract. In 2017 Carolyn took over the role as Molly in Ghost from Sarah Harding due to the subsequent pain from an injury she received on the third series of The Jump. The Carns Theatre Passion reviewer said ‚ÄúHer voice is just gorgeous and she carried all the numbers she was part of. She particularly stood out in her Act One solo ‚ÄòWith You‚Äô which bought tears to many eyes‚Äù. In October 2017 Carolyn produced her first concert Songs Chosen By You for Live at Zedel In November 2017 she starred as Marian Halcolme in The Woman in White, with a revised score, which opened at the Charing Cross Theatre in London. Lyn Gardner of The Guardian said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame that Lloyd Webber and Jones turned Collins‚Äô proto-feminist Marian into a more mundane standard-issue romantic heroine. But Carolyn Maitland sings with texture and gives the character definition.‚Äù Carolyn joined the West End revival of Annie the Musical as Grace Farrell, that began at the Piccadilly Theatre in London before showing at the Ed Mirvish Theatre in Downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Television and stage star Lesley Nicol starred as Miss Hannigan. Maitland continued playing Grace in the 2019 UK tour of Annie the Musical, opposite Anita Dobson, Lesley Joseph and Craig Revel- Horwood who all played Miss Hannigan during the tour.

She is a founding board member of the Contemporary Image Collective (CiC), an independent non-profit space for art and culture founded in Cairo in 2004. She also co-founded the independent publishing platform called Kayfa-ta in 2013. She was awarded the Jury Prize for her film Domestic Tourism II at Sharjah Biennal 9 (2009). Maamoun is a fellow of the Academy of the Arts of the World.  Life  Maha Maamoun was born in Oakland, California in 1972 and grew up in Cairo. She studied Economics and received an MA in Middle Eastern History. In 2004 Maamoun founded independent non-profit space for art and culture Contemporary Image Collective (CiC) in Cairo, becoming its founding board member. Besides her artistic practice in photography and video, she collaborates on independent publishing and curatorial projects. Maamoun was the co-curator of International Visual Arts Festival PhotoCairo3 in Cairo in 2005 and assistant curator for Meeting Points 5 in Berlin in 2007. In 2013 she curated Meeting Points 7 in Zagreb, Croatia and Video Room at Art Dubai 2013. The same year she co-founded Kayfa-ta, a non-profit Arabic publishing initiative. In 2014 she curated shows at Sharjah Art Gallery at the American University of Cairo and film program in Wiener Festwochen at K√ºnstlerhaus in Vienna. In 2018 Maamoun for the first time joined the 68th Berlin International Film Festival, Berlinale, as a part of curatorial team of ‚ÄúForum Expanded‚Äù. The same year she moderated ‚ÄòProjections‚Äô panel discussion on independent cinema and screening platforms during the 2018 March Meeting in Sharjah. Currently Maamoun co- curates the exhibition How to Maneurer: Shape-Shifting Texts and Other Publishing Tactics that takes place at Warehouse421 in Abu Dhabi till 16th February 2020.  Artistic style  Maamoun works primarily with video and photography that address the form and function of images in mainstream culture. She is interested in social conditioning and how the visual presentation of places and environments is expanded to appeal to different audiences. She claims that common visual and literary images form the cultural environment that we weave and are weaved into. Her work deals with circulation and function of images in vernacular culture, reframing these as tools for critical insights and analysis. Maamoun‚Äôs work acts as a lens through which we see familiar images in novel and insightful ways. Her recent video works consider the capacity of images to function critically in a variety of political, social and cultural contexts. Maamoun is specifically interested in urban fabric of her home city Cairo, drawing attention in her photographic works to the visual contradictions that surround her. Her generic visual representations of Cairo explore how images intersect with, and are negotiated by, personal experiences. She reflects on generic and overused national symbols and the ways in which they have been appropriated to construct personal narratives and collective histories. Since 2007 she is working on projects that take as their starting point the Pyramids of Giza as a visual and literary image.  Works  Domestic Tourism I (2005)  Domestic Tourism I is the photographic series where the genres of touristic images of Egypt provided a formal reference for actually exploring a more psychological experience of the city. These digitally manipulated images present more complicated, less-sellable and slightly uncomfortable images that comment on the Egypt consumed locally. Domestic Tourism I consists of four images: Beach, Cairo by Night, Felucca and Park. Domestic Tourism I: Beach depicts bathers at Alexandria‚Äôs famous Stanley Bridge where the density of the crowd in the water and the bathers‚Äô conservative dress indicates that the fortunes of the private-access beach have changed and the coastal city‚Äôs celebrated cosmopolitanism ceded to a resolutely lower middle class, Egyptian populace. Domestic Tourism: Cairo by Night offers a noctural view of one of the capital‚Äôs major Nile bridges where then-President Mubarak‚Äôs disembodied smile replaces the ads on many of the illuminated signboards lining the streets, recalling the former president‚Äôs irreverent popular alias: la vache qui rit (the laughing cow) and his rapacious neo-liberal economic policies. Domestic Tourism I: Felucca presents a touristic image of an eponymous sail boat plying the Nile with carnivalesque landscape of signboards celebrating then-President Mubarak in the background. Domestic Tourism I: Park depicts young couples huddled on benches in front of the state headquarters for public administration at one end of Tahrir Square, at the symbolic heart of the capital and the site, six years later, of Egypt‚Äôs 2011 revolution. The street lights with an abnormal intensity in the daytime scene and the oversaturated color of well-worn grass and strangled foliage looks unnatural in this notoriously polluted urban hub. Domestic Tourism I has been acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of New York. Domestic Tourism II (2009)  The film Domestic Tourism II, produced and commissioned by Sharjah Biennal 9, combines scenes from Egyptian films with the Pyramids as backdrop, examining narratives of recent history. NY Times called the film ‚Äúa funny, feature-length shout-out to the Great Pyramid of Giza‚Äù. To create Domestic Tourism II Maamoun looked for films that had a scene with the pyramids to see how different their cinematic representations are, and how they are implicated in the Cairo‚Äôs ongoing negotiations and active struggle over the past and present. She discovered that a lot of the scenes by the pyramids are quite politically charged and tied to distinct chapters in Egypt‚Äôs modern history. The film starts with the most recent scenes, descends back to the oldest scene, and then ascends up again to the present. Such chronology gives the film its emotional structure and rhythm as the drama engulfing the pyramids gradually rises and falls with time. The film was awarded a Biennal Jury Prize. 2026 (2010)  The video 2026 was shot a year before the revolution of 2011 imagining time-travel and upheaval, before the events in Tahrir Square began. The video disorients bridging together images and stories from the French and Egyptian time-travellers. The afterlife of 2026 in the Egyptian political context lends an additional resonance. Viewed today, the video appears to foretell real-world events by narrating a scene set on the threshold of fictional revolution. 2026 has now been acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Night Visitor: The Night of Counting the Years (2011)  The film Night Visitor: The Night of Counting the Years, compiled from mobile phone footage posted on YouTube, documents the break-in at the State Security buildings in Cairo and Damanhur in 2011. It takes us through previously impenetrable structures, from secret prisons up to lavish offices of government officials.  Dear Animal (2016)  The film was shot between Cairo and different locations in India weaves together a story by writer Haytham El-Wardany ‚ÄúLord of the Order of Existence‚Äù about a drug dealer who turns into a strange animal, and a selection of letters written by Azza Shaaban, a director-producer involved with the Egyptian revolution who now lives in India, from where she sends notes about her travel and healing process after the revolution. The films moves back and forth between cinematic story by El-Wardany, filmed in Cairo, and the scenes produced with Shaaban in India where is reads a selection of her letters, the camera moving between her and her private and public surroundings. Occupying disparate temporal and spatial registers, Dear Animal aimed to raise thoughts about our relationship to power, violence, and the unfamiliar. The film suggests power relations were so up-ended by the revolution that people even started questioning the categories that separate animals from human. Dear Animal was in The Short Film program at Art Basel film festival in 2017 and was named in highlights of the festival by CNN. It was also shown at the Sharjah Art Foundation in 2016.  Subduer (2017)  The title of the film - The Subduer - is a reference to one of the ‚Äô99 most beautiful names of Allah‚Äô in Islamic tradition. The film appeared as a result of a regular visit by Maamoun to one of the many public notary offices in Egypt when she saw state functionaries saying prayers from soiled and aging sheets of paper. Calling to our higher selves, our finer temperaments, our sense of forgiveness, and reminding us of the brevity of this material world, these prayers project a parallel world-view to the highly regulated material world of notary offices. Maamoun visited many public notary offices across Cairo to record the appearance of these prayers. The Subduer was performed live in the new version conceived for the Gr√ºner Salon‚Äôs space in Berlin.  Exhibitions and festivals  Maha Maamoun‚Äôs works have been presented in numerous worldwide institutions including Centre Pompidou, Paris; Tate Modern, London; MoMA, New York; ICP, New York; New Museum, New York; MuHKA, Antwerp; MATHAF ‚Äì Arab Museum of Modern Art, Doha; Mori Art Museum, Tokyo; Beirut Art Center, Beirut; Makan, Amman; Steirischer Herbst, Graz; Witte de With, Rotterdam; Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia; Den Frie Centre of Contemporary Art, Copenhagen and Haus der Kunst, Munich.

Early life Swami Achhootanand was born to Moti Ram and Ram Piari into Chamar caste and were followers of Kabir panth. His father and uncles, Kalu Ram and Subedar Mathura Prasad and elder brother, Subedar Bant Lal, all of them were in the British Indian Army. He studied in the town of Nasirabad and was well versed in eight languages ‚Äì Urdu, English, Hindi, Sanskrit, Persian, Marathi, Bengali, and Punjabi. He was married at a young age to Hira Bai or Durga Bai. He joined a group of sadhus and left for a pilgrimage and lived with them for 10 years. Thereafter, he came under the influence of Swami Sachitanand of Arya Samaj and joined him. After joining he changed his name to \\"Swami Hariharanand\\" and read Vedas and Satyarth Prakash. Adi Hindu Movement After a series of incidents he understood Arya Samaj's actual motive is not removal of caste but keeping Dalits only under Hindu fold. He distanced himself from the movement and started campaigning against them by his writtings and protests. He was invited to Delhi and successfully debated with Arya Samaji leader, Swami Akhilanand over scriptures. He then laid the foundation of \\"Jati Sudhar Achhoot Sabha'\\" and was conferred the title of \\"Shri 108\\" by proposal of Arya preacher, Pandit Ramchandra & Naubat Singh, the minister of Shahdara Samaj in Delhi. In 1922, he founded Adi Hindu Movement and pioneered the first social reform movement for Dalits in Hindi belt. He advocated that Dalits to be the original inhabitants of India and later, he came to be known as \\"Swami Achhootanand\\". Swami became one of the revolutionaries in Adi movements of India and stood in row with its founders ‚Äì Gopal Baba Walangkar, Bhagya Reddy Varma, B. Shayam Sunder and Mangu Ram Mugowalia. The first national Adi Hindu convention was held at Delhi in 1923 followed by Nagpur in 1924, Hyderabad in 1925, Madras in 1926, Allahabad in 1927, Bombay in 1928, Amravati in 1929 and Allahabad in 1930 with several provincial and special conventions also held at different places. Politics Swami Achhootanand welcomed King Edward VII, the Prince of Wales and even demanded proposals for Depressed Classes which was going to be submitted before Simon Commission. Later, he met Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar in Adi Hindu Conference at Bombay and then supported Simon Commission at Lucknow. He also supported Dr.B.R Ambedkar through telegram during Round Table Conference held in London. He strongly opposed the term 'Harijan' referring to untouchables which was coined by Mahatma Gandhi. Literary career To bring a new awareness among the Depressed Classes he started his own publications and used to publish his poetry under his pen name ‚ÄúHarihar‚Äù. Swamiji was one of the \\"Pioneer of Dalit Literature\\" in Hindi. In 1922, he started his first monthly paper ‚ÄúAchhut‚Äù, from Delhi but closed down in 1923 and again he started ‚ÄúPrachin Hindu‚Äù but that too closed within a year. There upon, he established, Adi Hindu Press and started publishing his journal The Adi-Hindu Journal from Kanpur between 1924‚Äì32. He was a philosopher-poet and also a playwrighter. He wrote six books in Hindi - \\"Shambuk Balidan (Drama), Achhut Pukar - Religious songs, Mayanand Balidan (biography), Pakhand Khandani, Adi-Vansh Ka Danka,\\" etc. His health worsened after the Virat Adi Hindu Conference held at Gwalior in 1932 and got passed away in 1933 at Zhabar Idgah in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh.

The release followed her extended play Super Sunset (2018), but departed from her previous style and process of songwriting. The album was primarily written by Allie X and James Alan Ghaleb, and produced by Oscar G√∂rres. It received generally positive reviews. Background and development Allie X released her extended play Super Sunset in 2018. Cape God was originally intended as a sister record to the EP, though Allie X later decided to split the project into a separate album. She contrasted her approach to writing Cape God with what she had taken for her previous releases. While she stated that her previous releases involved experimentation with \\"alter egos\\", Cape God was \\"a pretty personal, pretty intimate body of work\\". In an ask-me-anything session on Reddit, Allie X noted that \\"it was easier [for her] to make this record than any other\\" and that \\"[the process] happened very seamlessly.\\" Allie X drew inspiration for the album from the characters within Heroin: Cape Cod, USA, a 2015 documentary about the opioid epidemic in Massachusetts. She wrote songs from the point of view of one of the documentary's characters, and developed a fictionalized Cape Cod in her mind as a way to reflect on her personal experiences. She met producer Oscar G√∂rres and songwriter James Alan Ghaleb in Stockholm, shortly after writing the opening line for the album's first track \\"Fresh Laundry\\". She described her songwriting process as \\"seamless, therapeutic, and very enjoyable,\\" though she also credited G√∂rres's production for being able to complement her \\"layered kind of complex lyrics\\". Cape God was Allie X's first album to feature vocal duets. She began work with feature artists Troye Sivan and Mitski in 2018. Artwork The album cover photograph was shot in a cave in upstate New York by Brendon Burton, using natural light and a smoke bomb. Songs The album opens with \\"Fresh Laundry\\", described by Sarah Shodipe from The Line Of Best Fit as lo-fi, while Stuart Derdeyn of Vancouver Sun wrote that the song had a \\"big booming beat, spooky vocal and splashy keyboard hook\\". Allie X described \\"Devil I Know\\" as about dealing with a toxic relationship; reviews described the song as catchy and as combining melodies with moodiness, but also noted a strong resemblance to the Arctic Monkeys song \\"Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?\\". \\"Love Me Wrong\\" is a ballad featuring Australian singer Troye Sivan. Allie X gained inspiration for the song from the 2018 coming-of-age film Boy Erased, in which Sivan played a supporting role. She noted the similarities between the film's main character and her writing process for the album. The song showed two perspectives on a lovers' quarrel. Reviews widely described \\"Super Duper Party People\\" as the album's standout track, while noting its corny title. musicOMH described it as \\"a bass-led anthem\\" with lyrics about people at \\"a particularly seedy nightclub\\", DIY said the track \\"perfectly displays [Allie X]'s ability to create a refreshing take on what could otherwise be by-numbers pop\\", while Exclaim! said the track was \\"hallucinogenic\\" with references to drugs and sex. \\"Susie Save Your Love\\", a collaboration with indie rock artist Mitski, is a pop song with drums, bass and synths and included \\"depressing\\" lyrics about a woman named Susie stuck in an unwanted relationship. Paste described Allie X and Mitski's vocals as \\"almost too perfect of a match\\", but that it was a \\"solid track\\" for dancing alone. musicOMH noted that the song \\"sounds unaccountably sad yet impossible not to dance to\\". Release and promotion The album was preceded by the release of four promotional singles, the first of which, \\"Fresh Laundry\\" was released on September 27, 2019. This was followed by \\"Rings a Bell\\" on October 18, 2019, \\"Regulars\\" on November 8, 2019, and \\"Love Me Wrong\\", a collaboration with Troye Sivan, on December 6, 2019. \\"Devil I Know\\" was released as the lead single for the album on January 31, 2020. Critical reception On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 78 based on eight reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Corey van den Hoogenband of Exclaim! said the album \\"elegantly blends\\" Allie X's new and old styles, creating \\"[her] best work yet\\". He remarked that the instrumentals contained \\"a carefully crafted grit and griminess\\", noting that while she had used such an effect to create a \\"sense of impending doom\\" on all her work, the instrumentals on Cape God felt more communicative than her previous records. John Murphy of musicOMH said that the album had an \\"experimental edge\\" separating it from the work of other alternative pop singers like Marina Diamandis and Charli XCX, making it \\"one of the most delightfully weirdest albums of the year\\". Q magazine noted that while \\"Cape God might be an awful place to visit\\", \\"the tunes [on the album] are great\\". Eric Torres of Pitchfork described Cape God as \\"the strongest concept in her catalog to date\\". In a more mixed review, Martin Toussaint of DIY stated that while the album was more ambitious than Allie X's previous releases, it \\"lacked any edge she's previously shown\\" and \\"on the whole [the album] falls short\\". Toussaint criticized the album for failing to \\"push boundaries\\" in the same way as did Allie X's previous works such as CollXtion I.

The arena, slated to open in June 2022 as the replacement to the Frank Erwin Center, is being built on a former parking lot located immediately south of Mike A. Myers Soccer Stadium. The arena will seat 10,000 for most basketball games and expand to 15,000 seats for large basketball games and other events. The Moody Center should not be confused with the similarly-named Moody Theater, a much smaller live-entertainment venue located nearby in downtown Austin. History In 2018, it was announced that Oak View Group and the University of Texas had agreed to form an innovative public-private partnership, to build a new $388 million arena. The arena will replace the Frank Erwin Center as the home for the Texas Longhorns basketball programs, and will also function as a world-class events center for the city of Austin. The new arena will be named the Moody Center following the Moody Foundation's grant of $130 million to the university. Oak View Group is funding the construction, and will manage the building at its cost in exchange for the right to most of the income from non-UT events, such as concerts and shows, for at least the first 35 years after opening. UT, however, owns the land under the arena and will be the owner of the building. Under the terms of the agreement, the university will have exclusive control of the arena for 60 days each year to hold men's and women's basketball games, graduations, and other events. Oak View Group, along with partners Live Nation and C3 Presents, will have the right to hold events on the other days. Construction now underway, the groundbreaking ceremony took place just south of Mike A. Myers Soccer Stadium on December 3, 2019 with completion expected to occur in 2022.

As a non-party figure, he became the chairman of the Ukrainian National Council in Kiev, established on October 5, 1941, by the Ouns of the Melnik direction. In its structure and political orientation, the Ukrainian National Council (UN–°) reminded the Central Council of the times of the Ukrainian People's Republic. This symbolized the continuity of the state tradition. The UNC consisted of 130 delegates who represented all Ukrainian lands and was not a one-party formation. It was composed of members with different political positions, from hetmans to nationalists. The core was the presidium, which, besides Velychkivsky, included engineer Anton Baranovsky, geologist Ivan Dubina, and OUN leader Osip Boidunik. At a press conference, together with Bagaziy and Melnik they proclaimed that there was only one legal chairman of Ukraine, as well as the restoration of Ukrainian statehood, which was negatively received by the German authorities.

In 1951, Velychkivsky and his wife moved to the United States and lived with their daughter Irena Karpenko in New Jersey. there, he was involved in the active intellectual life of the SSS, studying economics and writing many reports, including \\"Agricultural Policy in Ukraine in the Aftermath of its Liberation from the Soviet Occupation\\". At the 1961 World Congress of Ukrainian Science in New York, he delivered the report \\"The Soviet Experiment with Agronomists\\". He also published a book on the destruction of agriculture by the Soviet authorities. In addition, he edited the Ukrainian Quarterly, where he published his own materials. Despite his old age, he led an active social and scientific life. In the post-war period, he sought to bring together different factions of the Ukrainian liberation movement. Although he belonged to the \\"Melnik\\" faction, he was also published in \\"Bandera\\" publications, for example, in the journal The Liberation Way, where, in 1965, his memoirs \\"The Sad Times of the German Occupation (1941‚Äì1944)\\" were published. Velychkivsky died in July 1976. Posthumous honors On February 19, 2016, the 3rd Chervonoarmeysky Lane in Zhytomyr was renamed Mykola Velichkivskyi Lane on the order of the Mayor of Zhytomyr.

History  The then-newly established Academy of Fine Arts Sarajevo was first located in the building of the Pedagogical Academy in Sarajevo. At the same time, the home of today's ALU was the first and only evangelist church constructed in the times of the Austro- Hungarian occupation of BiH. The church was built in 1899 and designed by the architect Karlo Par≈æik in a Romanesque-Byzantine style. The building was devastated in early 1992 at the start of the Bosnian War. The church was proclaimed a cultural-historical monument and is therefore included on the list of protected buildings by the Institute for the Protection of Cultural- Historical and Natural Heritage. Muhamed Karamehmedoviƒá (an art historian and the first Dean of ALU), Nada Pivac (an academic painter), Mersad Berber (an academic painter), Boro Aleksiƒá (another academic painter), Alija Kuƒçukaliƒá (an academic sculptor), and Zdenko Grgiƒá (another academic sculptor) are some of the famous professors and founders of the Academy of Fine Arts Sarajevo. , the Academy has had 2,666 enrolled students since its establishment; by May 2012, it had recorded 1,212 graduates for undergraduate study. Postgraduate studies were introduced in 1983. There are 237 Masters students (M. A. degree). The Academy houses six departments that offer a multitude of courses: # Department of Art Education # Department of Painting # Department of Sculpting # Department of Printmaking # Department of Graphic Design # Department of Product Design The Academy of Fine Arts Sarajevo introduced the Bologna educational system (4+1) in the 2006/07 school year.

Musically the work was based on Ariosti‚Äôs Amor tra nemici (1708), but most of the arias were replaced by the work of other composers, including six arias from Giovanni Bononcini‚Äòs Turno Aricino. It is generally described as the first opera in London sung entirely in Italian, by Italian singers, although there were intermezzi in English between the acts of the main opera. Action Attilio Ariosti Almahide has been brought up as a man in preparation for killing her father‚Äôs enemy Almiro; instead she has fallen in love with him. Almiro loves Celinda, who is herself loved by the king, Almanzor, but she loves the disguised Almahide. After scenes of jealousy and threats of violence, tensions are happily resolved with two marriages. Libretto The libretto was by Silvio Stampiglia and Pietro Antonio Bernardon, who adapted Dryden‚Äôs Almanzor and Almahide. In the preface Heidegger explained that he had written the entire work in Italian to avoid having the cast singing in two languages (as they had done in recent productions of Camilla and Thomyris), and that he had translated the libretto back from Italian to English to allow audience understanding. Production history Almahide was first performed at Queen‚Äôs Theatre, Haymarket on 10 January 1710. The first production was popular and had a run of fourteen nights. The cast was composed of Italian singers; three castrati - Nicolini (Almiro), Valentini (Almanzor), and Giuseppe Cassani (Gemir), as well as two women - Margherita de L'Epine (Almahide), and Isabella Girardeau (Celinda). In February 1710, Walsh, Randall and Hare published Songs in the new Opera, Call‚Äôd Almahide, including the overture and 43 arias. The production was revived the following year with four performances in April and one in May, with Margharita de l‚ÄôEpine in the title role.

The Sin Piedad show tookplace on January 1, 2020 in Arena M√©xico, Mexico City, Mexico. The 2020 Sin Piedad will be the 15th event under the Sin Piedad name and the fifth year in a row CMLL has held the show on New Year's Day. In the main event Dulce Gardenia defeated Kawato-San, forcing Kawato-San to be shaved bald afterwards per the Lucha de Apuestas stipulation for the match. On the undercard Pr√≠ncipe Diamante defeated Esp√≠ritu Negro, after which Esp√≠ritu Negro was forced to unmask and reveal his real name, Juan Manuel Gonz√°lez Olalde, in front of the Arena M√©xico crowd. In the semi-main event match La Alianza de Plata y Oro (\\"The Alliance of Silver and Gold\\"; Car√≠stico and M√≠stico) defeated La Nuev a Generaci√≥n Dinamita (\\"The New Generation Dymaites\\"; Cuatrero and Forastero) to defend their CMLL World Tag Team Championship. The show included three additional matches. Production Background The Mexican wrestling company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (Spanish for \\"World Wrestling Council\\"; CMLL) has held a number of major shows over the years using the moniker Sin Piedad (\\"No Pity\\" or \\"No Mercy\\"). CMLL has intermittently held a show billed specifically as Sin Piedad since 2000, primarily using the name for their \\"end of the year\\" show in December, although once they held a Sin Piedad show in August as well. CMLL has on occasion used a different name for the end-of-year show but Sin Piedad is the most commonly used name. All Sin Piedad shows have been held in Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \\"home\\". The 2018 Sin Piedad was the third first show to be held on New Year's Day after being held on the same day in 2016 and 2017. Starting in 2011 CMLL has been promoting a New Year's Day show with bigger, more prominent and promoted matches, although they did not specifically promote the shows under a special event name, they were simply a special version of their weekly Arena Mexico shows. Starting in 2011 CMLL added at least one high profile match to their shows, slowly building them into a special event. in 2011 the show featured the annual Reyes del Aire (\\"Kings of the Air\\") tournament, won by √Ångel de Oro. In 2012 the January 1 show saw Hombre Bala Jr. and Super Halc√≥n Jr. defeated the team known as Los Rayos Tapat√≠o in a Luchas de Apuestas, masks vs masks match in what turned out to be Los Rayos last match in CMLL. The main event of the 2012 was the finals of a tournament for the vacant CMLL World Heavyweight Championship which was El Terrible defeat Rush 17th heavyweight champion. The 2013 start of the year show was highlighted first by then CMLL World Welterweight Champion P√≥lvora successfully defending against Tit√°n and then the team of Boby Zavala and Disturbio defeated Leono and Tigre Blanco, forcing Leono and Blanco to have their hair shaved off as a result. The 2014 show, the last January 1 show without a specific title saw Super Halc√≥n Jr. win that year's La Copa Junior tournament. The 2019 Sin Piedad show was the 14th show under the Sin Piedad label. Storylines The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

It was the first accredited music school in the United States. The school opened in 1835 and closed in 1876.  Founding  Music Vale Seminary was founded by Oramel Whittlesey (1801-1876), a piano-maker and state senator. Born in Salem, Whittlesey was the son of prominent Methodist minister John Whittlesey. He married Charlotte Maconda Morgan (1805‚Äì1865) in 1826. The couple moved to Buffalo, New York, where Whittlesey and his two brothers ran a successful piano manufacturing business. The Whittleseys returned to Salem in 1833, where Oramel continued his piano business and began to teach music to pupils from Salem and neighboring towns. Whittlesey founded the Music Vale Seminary in 1835, and the school gained critical mass by 1839. History Initially called Mr. Whittlesey‚Äôs School, Music Vale Seminary grew rapidly. By the mid-1800s it had become a boarding school, teaching an average of eighty pupils per year. Graduating classes averaged twenty students. Students received instruction in harmony, notation, voice, and performance on instruments such as the piano, organ, harp, and guitar. The conservatory attracted students from as far away as Kentucky, Kansas, Nova Scotia, and the West Indies. The conservatory was authorized to confer normal degrees, or technically teacher's certificates, by the Connecticut State Board of Higher Education. The school charged $1.50 per student per day, which covered room and board, instruction, and the use of instruments for practice. Students frequently staged public performances of music and drama. Music Vale Seminary was a family business. Mrs. Whittlesey ran much of the school's finances and day-to-day operations. Whittlesey's four daughters taught at the school. The eldest daughter would go on to found the Maginnis Institute of Music in New London in 1864. The outbreak of the U.S. Civil War in 1861 reduced enrollment, as many of the school's wealthy clientele had come from the South. The school's buildings burned down in 1868, and though quickly rebuilt at a cost of $35,000-$40,000, the school faced competition from a plethora of other conservatories. After Whittlesey's death in September 1876, his daughter, Sarah Pratt, closed the school and sold the property. In March 1897, a chimney fire burned down the conservatory buildings for the second time. They were never rebuilt.  Legacy  In the early 1900s, the site of Music Vale Seminary was purchased by Bela Pratt, a sculptor and grandson of Oramel Whittlesey. Another descendent, John Morgan Bodman, bought the Music Vale barn and property in the 1960s. In 1996, the Bodman family donated much of the acreage to the Salem Land Trust. This land is now protected as a wildlife habitat, part of the Eightmile River watershed. Today, all that remains of the Music Vale Academy is a privately owned red barn, built in 1849, and a state historical marker off Route 85.

Tradeware Ceramics in the Philippines are ceramics produced in different countries and traded within the Philippines. They are often referred to as export ware and became popular due to their kaolin-type clay that was difficult to replicate. Tradeware ceramics in the Philippines range from Pre-Spanish arrival through the Post-Colonial period with the Manila Galleon. The leading scholars in this field are Carl E. Guthe, Li Jian'an, Li Min, Olov Janse, and Robert Fox. The main periods include Yuan (1271‚Äì1368), Early Ming (1368‚Äì1464), Middle Ming (1465‚Äì1522), Late Ming (1522‚Äì1644), and Transitional Period (1644‚Äì1683). The primary types of Chinese blue-and-white porcelain found in the Philippines are Jingdezhen and Zhangzhou ware. These porcelain are classified from type I-V. The case studies of burials and ritual in relation to Philippine tradeware ceramics illustrate the sociopolitical importance of these vessels.  Materials  Tradeware ceramics in the Philippines consisted of Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese porcelain. The materials discovered can be identified as 70-75% Chinese, 22-25% Thai and 5-8% Vietnamese. Tradeware ceramics are named by their place of manufacture, individually by various popular terms and the period in which they were produced. The most common ceramics found in this region are Chinese blue-and-white porcelain. The primary origin of the Chinese blue-and white porcelain are Zhangzhou and Jingdezhen.  Jingdezhen  Jingdezhen, a hub for Chinese ceramic production in Jiangxi, was a main source of high quality porcelain that dominated the international market. By the end of the fourteenth century, primary production sites in Jingdazhen shifted from bluish-white colored wares to predominantly blue-and-white porcelain. This blue-and-white porcelain was extremely valuable by the Middle Ming Period. This widespread distribution is revealed through Kraak porcelain found in European, colonial, and shipwreck archaeological contexts. Kraak ware can be classified as any thin, blue-and-white glazed porcelain with a rough base that has diverging chatter markings. The surface is embellished with dividing panels that illustrate an array of motifs such as plants, birds, insects, and humans. Kraak primarily originated from Jingdezhen production sites and was intended for the Middle Eastern and European market. Exported products proved to be more profitable than domestic products; because of this, Kraak ware is typically of higher quality than that of wares traded within local markets. Jingdezhen ceramic production applied local technological traditions that involved smaller gourd-shaped kilns. Only a small amount of wares could be fired per round and at a slower rate, which resulted in the highest quality wares with smooth glazes and translucent white color. In addition, the Jingdezhen potters implemented a multitude of measures to inhibit sand and other debris from the floor from adhering to the firing vessel.  Zhangzhou  In the sixteenth century, the seaport of Yuegang in the Zhangzhou region prospered as it took part in the expanding international maritime trade. A predominant portion of the ships leaving the Yuegang port were headed towards the Philippines on a journey that only took fifteen to twenty days. The Yuegang seaport soon shifted to the forefront of international maritime trade, and as a result, export-driven businesses that focused on silk and ceramics were multiplying all throughout Zhangzhou at an exponential rate. By the end of the sixteenth century, the Zhangzhou products still proved to be extremely valuable in an international market that was customarily overshadowed by suppliers with Jingdezhen products. European traders generally bought lesser quality Zhangzhou wares as financial capital for products and services offered by indigenous groups, whereas they typically used the refined Jingdezhen wares for their own European local markets (and the elites that live there). As a result, the study of Zhangzhou porcelain has broader implications such that it can point to interactions between colonizers and the colonized since archaeologists often find porcelain that originated from Zhangzhou in diverse archaeological contexts that range from California to South Africa. As newly discovered trade routes enabled for the expansion of international trade, the ceramic production in Zhangzhou increased in order to maximize profits. The production sites in Zhangzhou are closely associated with the mass-production of unrefined and substandard quality tradeware. This is due to the applied shortcut version of firing the wares in large step-chamber kilns which, in turn, compromised the quality in order to save time and produce a high volume of wares. These relatively lousy quality wares were intended to replicate the sophisticated quality wares produced in Jingdezhen.  Periods  The age of tradeware ceramics are divided into two main periods based on Spanish contact with the Philippines: Pre-Spanish arrival and Post-Spanish arrival. The Pre- Spanish arrival consists of the Yuan, Early Ming, and Middle Ming periods. The Post-Spanish arrival includes the Late Ming and Transitional periods. {  +Pre-Spanish Arrival Yuan 1271 - 1368 - Early Ming 1368 - 1464 - Middle Ming 1465 - 1522 } Prior to Spanish arrival and the Manila Galleon trade, tradeware ceramics were limited to high-ranking elites and chiefs. During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries of the Yuan period, porcelain was traded at large volumes. Near the end of the fourteenth century, the primary ceramic for trade shifted towards blue-and-white porcelain. {  +Post Spanish Arrival !Late Ming !1522 - 1644 - !Transitional Period !1644 - 1683 } In the Late Ming period, 69% of all tradeware ceramics discovered in burial cites and caves are Zhangzhou ware and 31% are Jingdezhen ware. The quality of Jingdezhen ware are much finer than the standard Zhangzhou ware. Jingdezhen - Ming Dynasty (1368-1644)  Classification of Blue & White Porcelain  In order to compare the quality of different types of porcelain across varying eras found at different production sites, a classification system produced by Li Min (2013) is often used. It comprises five different types and has enabled archaeologists to analyze the broad trends in porcelain utilization within the local societies.  Type I  Porcelain classified as Type I have an exterior appearance that is clear and glassy. Since the body is composed of fine-grained kaolin clay, the body has an even, polished texture and looks white translucent in color. The overall construction is of utmost refinement and emphasized high quality. There is a strong association between ceramic production centers and the level of quality of the wares. Most Type I porcelain have a high probability of originating from the production site of Jingdezhen, the epicenter of the Chinese ceramic industry in Jiangxi. Most importantly, Jingdezhen was a site that produced relatively higher quality of wares compared to that of the lackluster, poor quality Zhangzhou wares. This is due to the fact that the Jingdezhen site utilized the local technological tradition of small gourd- shaped kilns that fired a low quantity of wares per round. Also, ny the end of the fourteenth century, Jindezhen slowly transitioned from bluish-white ware to the classic white porcelain look.  Type II  Porcelain classified as Type II have a glaze that is a hazy off-white color and not as translucent in comparison to Type I wares. At first glance, Li Min (2013) has described the appearance as a hybrid of a gray colored porcelain-stoneware with a hazy glaze. Although the porcelain is constructed with somewhat subpar quality, it is still considered to be of higher refinement than those wares that were mass-produced and, thus, were of lower quality.  Type III  Porcelain classified as Type III have characteristics of deteriorating quality, such as crudely constructed and inelegant glaze. The glaze has inconsistent dismal- looking color throughout the body that has many bubbles. The material is made of light slender gray stoneware instead of the traditional kaolin clay. The majority of wares that belong to the classification types III-V have a high association to the production site at Zhangzhou. Maritime traders that wanted to profit off of the expanding global trade of the sixteenth century generated export-driven factories in Zhangzhou. These sites made massive quantities of relatively inferior quality wares that duplicated the external appearance of Jingdezhen wares; oftentimes in literature, these Zhangzhou wares are referred to as Swatow wares by archaeologists. To expedite the rate of production, an alteration of the traditional technology traditions was made, in which Zhangzhou production sites utilized large step-chamber kilns that enabled a higher volume of wares to be generated. To meet the demands of global trade, quantity was prioritized over the quality of the wares. While the European traders preferred the highest quality wares from Jingdezhen for their local European markets, they often used the unrefined wares from Zhangzhou as a method of payment for a variety of goods and services accepted from native groups of people with whom they came into contact with as they traveled across countries.  Type IV  All porcelain classified as Type IV are covered in an imperfect, patchy glaze that has consists of a few cracks. There are a higher concentration of bubbles present all throughout the surface that are larger in diameter. Type III and Type IV generally have the similar same external appearance, but the degree of substandard quality present within Type IV is more extreme. The rushed method of kiln firing results in uneven glazes that are tacky and syrupy. The material is made of a grainy clay paste that has a harsh texture and a dismal-looking gray color.  Type V  Porcelain classified as Type V were typically not traded on the market considering the fact that the unsophisticated outer appearance did not warrant any interested buyers on the market. This is because the surface of the wares are covered with pinholes and cracks that would flake when held. Before these wares were placed in the kiln to fire, the clay material was not compacted or purified, which led to the coarse texture of these dilapidated wares.  Case Studies   Calatagan  Calatagan is situated near the Batangas Province southwest of Manila. The leading scholars in this region were Olov Janse who started excavating prehispanic Calatagan burials during the 1940s and Robert Fox led his excavations from 1958 through the 1960s. Out of 1,296 burials, infants, children, juveniles, and adults were found. Furthermore, the majority of tradeware porcelain plates had solar designs or bird motifs that were placed over the pelvis in burials. For example, a Karitunan adult (KR-50) in Calatagan was buried with several grave goods in addition to a blue-and-white porcelain plate over the pelvis with chrysanthemum design. The tradeware ceramics in the grave of KR-50 had a gold ring, blade, solar motifs, and a stone charm to indicate this individual's participation in raiding and trading. In Grace Barretto-Tesoro's Where Are the Datu and Catalonan in Early Philippine Socieites? Investigating Status in Calatagan, she claims this individual (KR-50) was most likely a male datu who had a prestigious role in Pre-Spanish society due to his expertise in raiding and maritime trade. The catalonan healers in Pre-Hispanic Philippines also had a prestigious position in society and assisted in ritual sacrifices by striking porcelain vessels in order for their Tagalog deities to hear them during the offering procession.  Balingasay, Bolinao  Balingasay, Bolinao is in the province of Pangasinan and this burial site dates to the fourteenth-fifteenth century. 51 adults were buried at this site and an infant was interred in a Chinese brown- glazed Ming jar that dates back to the late thirteenth-early fourteenth century. According to Grace Barretto-Tesoro's Burial Goods in the Philippines: An Attempt to Quantify Prestige Values Pre-Spanish societies in the Philippines traded forest products for Chinese porcelain, silk, gold, and jewelry. In the Tanjay region, chiefs from upland communities were in charge of redistribution of prestige or foreign goods and glazed Asian tradeware had restricted distribution. Thus, prior to colonialism in the Philippines, tradeware ceramics were a marker of social status and were passed down to the next generation as discussed in the Balingasay, Bolinao case study.  Old Kiyyangan Village, Ifugao  The 2012 excavation of the Old Kiyyangan Village in Ifugao was led by Stephen Acabado, Grace Barretto-Tesoro, and Noel Amano. This research revealed that upland communities in Ifugao used tradeware ceramics for rice wine production and these vessels were only accessible to the elites who controlled wet rice cultivation. Furthermore, rice was viewed as a prestige good and was redistributed by elites in feasting rituals to form alliances with lowlanders. Thus, rice was not viewed as a monetary form of currency in Ifugao but rather as an active participant in ritual practices.  Significance  Porcelain production was stimulated as a result of the changing chiefly dynamics among indigenous groups within the Philippines. Porcelain served as symbols of political influence, as they were not only used in ritualized feasts associated with life crises and calendrical events, but also negotiation incentives amongst polities. A study in Tanjay, Negros, Philippines demonstrated that the immense quantity of foreign porcelains in burials and settlements increased significantly from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries. Prior to the fifteenth century (and the introduction of the Manila Galleon trade), the high-quality exported porcelain were predominantly limited to high-ranking elites and chiefs. The importance of competitive feasting in chiefly polities and status competition can be seen through the decrease in quality of porcelain (from more diverse to less diverse vessels), in which large inventories of less attractive porcelain (lower quality) were intended for a growing market of lower social class. Once the Manila Galleon trade was in full effect, the quality in porcelain starts to decrease dramatically, ultimately leading to porcelain tradewares becoming more accessible to lower class communities. The large influx of several competing porcelain producers (of varying quality) from China resulted from the placement of high value on foreign porcelain in Philippine political economies.

As professor of neurobiology at Cornell University, she developed quantitative electron microscopic autoradiography as a means to investigate the neuromuscular junction. The Society for Neuroscience created the Mika Salpeter Lifetime Achievement Award in her honour.  Early life and education  Salpeter was born in Riga. Her father was a Yiddish scholar and Salpeter was fluent in Yiddish. During the rise of Nazi Germany Salpeter emigrated from Latvia to Canada, before moving to the United States in 1945. Salpeter attended high school in New York City. She was an undergraduate student at Hunter College, where she was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and graduated Suma cum laude. Salpeter moved to Cornell University for her doctoral studies, where she earned a PhD under the supervision of Howard Liddell. She spent a year at the Australian National University before returning to Cornell University as a postdoctoral fellow with Marcus Singer. Singer's laboratory was based in the Zoology department, where she studied cells using an electron microscope. Salpeter was appointed a research associate in the Singer lab in 1961 and soon after promoted to Senior Research Associate.  Research and career  Neurobiology was an emerging field at the start of Salpeter's research career, and she decided to concentrate her efforts on the neuromuscular junction. The neuromuscular junction is a synapse that controls all voluntary movement, the formation of which was extensively investigated by Salpeter throughout her research career. In particular Salpeter looked at the role of acetylcholine receptors. Salpeter struggled to secure a faculty position at Cornell University ‚Äì Singer, her biggest advocate in the department, moved to Case Western Reserve University, and the academic community were not welcoming to women. Salpeter did not let this atmosphere phase her, and continued her research as a non-faculty member. In 1967 Salpeter was recruited to the Cornell University Section of Neurobiology and Behavior. Here she worked in the laboratory of Benjamin Siegel and was supported by the National Institutes of Health. She spent a year in the laboratory of Vincent Wigglesworth at the University of Cambridge. In 1973 Salpeter was promoted to Professor. She developed quantitative electron microscopic autoradiography, and demonstrated it as a sensitive means to study the neuromuscular junction. Salpeter collaborated with her husband, astronomer and physicist Edwin Ernest Salpeter, on the interactions between nerves and muscle fibres.  Awards and honours  The Society for Neuroscience created the Mika Salpeter Lifetime Achievement Award in her honour. Her awards and honours include: *Society for Neuroscience Patricia Goldman-Rakic Hall of Honor *Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science *Hall of Fame of the City University of New York *Marcus Singer Award  Selected publications  * * *  Personal life  Salpeter married Edwin Ernest Salpeter in 1950. Together they had two daughters, Judy and Shelley. At the age of 71 she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. She continued to visit her laboratory everyday until the day that she died.

He is best known for leading several strikes against the United States Navy during the Battle of the Coral Sea, where they sank the carrier Lexington, the oiler Neosho and the destroyer Sims, and damaged Yorktown. He was killed in action during the final stages of the battle. Early career Kakuichi Takahashi entered the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1926 and graduated from the 56th class in March 1928. He was commissioned as an Ensign in November 1929. In December 1931, he was promoted to Lieutenant Junior Grade and was selected for a navy pilot training program at Kasumigaura Training Naval Air Station (NAS), from which he graduated in 1932. In December 1934, he was promoted to full Lieutenant. Takahashi later served on the carrier Kaga before he was transferred to the 13th Air Group operating in China. He was eventually promoted to Lieutenant Commander and became Air Group Commander (hik≈çtaich≈ç) of the carrier Sh≈çkaku. He led Aichi D3A dive bombers during the Attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 and during the Bombing of Rabaul in January 1942. In April 1942, he participated in the Indian Ocean Raid, where he led the strike force that sank the British carrier Hermes. Coral Sea In May 1942, Lieutenant Commander Takahashi participated in Operation MO to capture Port Moresby, which resulted in the Battle of the Coral Sea. On the morning of 7 May, Japanese scout planes spotted the oiler Neosho and the destroyer Sims just south of the IJN carrier fleet and misidentified the ships as a carrier and a cruiser respectively. Rear Admiral Chuichi Hara, the tactical commander of carrier division, launched a strike force of 36 Aichi D3A dive bombers, 24 Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers and 18 Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters, under Takahashi's overall command. While the strike force was heading south, the actual US carrier fleet was sighted to the north west of the previous contact. Unsure about the conflicting information from the sightings, and unwilling to break radio silence in case it revealed the presence of his fleet, Hara did not recall the strike force. Upon arrival at the target area at 0915, they could only find an oiler and a destroyer and spent two hours searching for the carriers. Unable to find any, Lieutenant Commander Takahashi ordered the torpedo bombers and the escorting fighters to return home at 1115, while his dive bombers went for Neosho and Sims. Four bombers attacked Sims and scored three hits, sinking her almost immediately, while the remaining 32 attacked Neosho and scored at least seven hits. After returning to the carriers, Lieutenant Commander Takahashi was selected to lead a late afternoon strike to attack the US carriers, which consisted of 12 Aichi D3A dive bombers and 15 Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers. Since the late departure meant that the strike would have to land at night, only veteran pilots were selected (including Lieutenant Commander Shigekazu Shimazaki and Lieutenant Tamotsu Ema). Due to poor weather, the strike force missed the US carriers. However, when they passed, they were detected by US radar, which led to Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters led by Lieutenant Commanders Paul Ramsey and James Flatley being sent to intercept. The ambush resulted in seven B5Ns and one D3A being shot down (another B5N took heavy damage and ditched on the return flight). In the aftermath, Takahashi and Shimazaki agreed to call off the strike, and the surviving planes jettisoned their bombs and torpedoes. During the return flight, several D3As stumbled across the US carriers, but could do nothing more than report their position. Furthermore, the darkness and confusion led to a few attempting to land on Yorktown, believing it to be their own carrier. They quickly aborted the landing when the ship's anti- aircraft batteries opened up. However, none were lost, and the remaining 11 dive bombers and 7 torpedo bombers returned and successfully landed on the Japanese carriers during the night. The next morning, 8 May, the two carrier fleets sighted each other. Eager to make up for the previous day, the Japanese launched a strike force of 33 Aichi D3A dive bombers, 18 Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers and 18 Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters, again commanded by Takahashi. They approached the US carriers unopposed since the Grumman Wildcats sent to intercept missed them due to poor radar guidance. Takahashi devised and executed a well-coordinated attack, where 19 dive bombers and 14 torpedo bombers went for the nearer Lexington (which Takahashi identified as the Saratoga) and 14 dive bombers and four torpedo bombers went for the farther Yorktown. Lexington was hit by two bombs and two torpedoes, while Yorktown was hit by a single bomb. Takahashi stayed in the area for some time to estimate the damage inflicted on the US carriers, and radioed his reports back to Hara. Notably, at 1217 he advised Hara to cancel his earlier (1125) sinking report on the \\"Saratoga\\" (as the Lexington temporarily recovered from the damage and resumed operations) and await his return. However, Takahashi never made it back - on the way out, he was shot down and killed, most likely by an F4F Wildcat returning from the US strike. He was posthumously promoted by two ranks to Captain, and, on 1 January 1943, received a special letter of commendation issued by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto.

It was recorded on January 23, 1973 at the Boarding House in San Francisco. It was released on December 20, 2019. At this concert, Jerry Garcia (electric guitar, vocals) and Merl Saunders (keyboards, vocals) were accompanied by their usual rhythm section of John Kahn (bass guitar) and Bill Vitt (drums). They were joined by vocalist Sarah Fulcher, who often sang with the band in the early part of 1973.  Critical reception  On AllMusic, Fred Thomas wrote, \\"On this date, Saunders and Garcia are more grounded in blues- and soul-rocking than the often-cosmic psychedelia of the Grateful Dead, but the creative chemistry of the band still explores the outer reaches of improvisation.... The relaxed energy and loose performances capture the magical connection Garcia and Saunders found in these low-pressure gigs. The powerful addition of Fulcher's presence makes Garcia Live, Vol. 12 a mandatory footnote to the scope of Garcia's creative output.\\" In Glide Magazine, Doug Collette wrote, \\"Garcia Live Volume 12 offers some of, if not the most, spirited, edgy performances yet released in this archival series. And while it‚Äôs not quite accurate to assign all the credit to vocalist Sarah Fulcher as the catalyst for this combustible content, it is no coincidence she is featured prominently in photos within the twelve-page booklet...

This concept refers to a character that encapsulates what might be considered \\"queer traits\\" that are recognizable to the audience, but are never labeled or claimed by the content creator. The identification itself of \\"queer traits\\" is constantly up for debate within queer communities,https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gk08zz.55 but an overexaggeration of masculine or feminine behaviors appears to be at the forefront. This concept is especially useful in the discussion of the media portrayal of LGBT people and queer representation as a whole. Queer coding can apply to both queerness in reference to sexuality and to narrative queerness, although it is primarily used culturally to apply to the former. It is a useful term not only in discussions of LGBTQ+ representation in media, but in conducting academic research involving queer theory or gender studies. Impact Queer coding is similar to that of queerbaiting in that they both involve implicit undertones of queerness, but unlike queerbaiting's negative connotation, queer coding is somewhat of a neutral trope. That being said, its neutrality does not exclude its negative impact, such as the tendency for villains to be the queer-coded opposite of the standard masculine male hero. Some members of the queer community have argued that the Walt Disney Company has attributed queer characteristics and behaviors to villainous or antagonistic characters.http://www.marginsmagazine.com/2015/12/18/fabulously- fiendish-disney-villains-and-queer-coding. Many believe Andreas Deja, a gay man and supporting animator for Scar and Jafar, based them on himself. However, Andreas actually based Scar on his English language voice actor Jeremy Irons, and Jafar's appearance by Conrad Veidt, an actor famous for his villainous roles who was heterosexual. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxokB7sfopchttps://andreasdeja.blogspot.com/2012/11/the- evolution-of-jafar.html Jonathan Freeman, Jafar's voice actor, claims his voice was inspired by Vincent Price and Boris Karloff, two actors famous for their villainous roles. https://ohmy.disney.com/movies/2015/10/13/8-things- you-didnt-know-about-aladdin/ Culture critics have claimed that this attribution can lead to a negative association between queerness and immoral, licentious behavior.https://controlforever.com/read/queercoding-and-horror- filmshttps://www.pride.com/geek/2019/4/07/10-queer-coded-gay-villains-our- childhood#media-gallery-media-2 Even if the villains were not portrayed as ‚Äúevil‚Äù because of their queerness, the association between queer characteristics and unethical figures remains. History The idea of non- explicit queer coding likely stems from the strict regulations of how queer characters were able to be portrayed in the early days of film-making. In 1930, The Hays Code was established as a standard for what was allowed to be shown on the big screen.‚ÄúOrigins of the Code.‚Äù Hitchcock and the Censors, by JOHN BILLHEIMER, University Press of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, 2019, pp. 9‚Äì23. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvfjcx5v.4. According to the code, films were not allowed to portray \\"perverse\\" subjects such as homosexuality, which inevitably led to the portrayal of non-explicit queer characters. The trend of the inclusivity of queer characters in a subtextual way likely bled into modern portrayals of queer characters. Commentary on the treatment of LGBT+ characters in film is made in the 1995 documentary The Celluloid Closet, and is one of the first instances in which the idea of queer coding is presented to the public.‚ÄúYouth, Realism and Form.‚Äù Straight Girls and Queer Guys: The Hetero Media Gaze in Film and Television, by Christopher Pullen, Edinburgh University Press, Edinburgh, 2016, pp. 147‚Äì168.

Why is the 1998 Adana pact between Turkey and Syria back in the news?, SINEM CENGIZ, January 25, 2019, arabnews.com.  Background  Syria and Turkey had long had a strained relationship, owing to historical Syrian claims on the Hatay Province, water disputes over the flow of the Tigris‚ÄìEuphrates river system and the two nations' opposite alignments within the context of the Cold War, as Turkey had joined NATO, while Syria grew close to the Soviet Union. In the 1980s and 1990s, Syria‚ÄìTurkey relations became even more strained as Syria had permitted both the establishment of Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) camps within its territory, as well as allowed its leader, Abdullah √ñcalan, to reside within the country. The PKK sought to establish an independent Kurdistan, which included areas held by Turkey and to this end fought in the Kurdish‚ÄìTurkish conflict against the Turkish government. Turkish authorities classified the PKK as a terrorist group and undertook a campaign seeking to eliminate it. As part of this campaign, Turkey threatened Syria with a ground invasion, should Syria not expel the group from its territory and hand over √ñcalan to Turkish authorities. The United States issued a parallel demand to Syria, in support of its Turkish ally. Syria initially rejected Turkish demands, but after considerable negotiations decided to partially agree to the end of the PKK's presence in Syria. In the runup to the agreement, the Syrian government made √ñcalan leave the country, rather than hand him over to Turkish authorities, as per Turkish demands. Instead, he was placed on a plane travelling to Moscow. Following √ñcalan's departure, Syria shut down PKK camps within its territory and arrested some PKK members which still had not left the country.  The agreement  The Adana Agreement was concluded between Turkey and Syria on 20 October 1998 in the Turkish city of Adana and included the following points: * Syria would not permit any activity which was deemed as \\"jeopardizing the security and stability\\" of Turkey. It would also not allow any form of financial or material support for the group to be delivered via its territory. * Syria would not allow the PKK to establish new camps, nor to take part in commercial activities within its borders. *Syria would recognize the PKK as a 'terrorist organization' and prohibit all of its activities, as well as the activities of any groups related to it, on Syrian soil. * Syria would not allow PKK members to travel through Syria to third countries. * Syria would not allow Abdullah √ñcalan to re-enter its borders. * Should Syria fail to fulfil these demands, Turkey would have the right to chase PKK suspects 5 km deep into Syria across the Syria‚ÄìTurkey border. The main object of the agreement was a restoration of bilateral Syrian-Turkish relations, though the Turkish delegation insisted that full normalization would only be achieved after Syria fulfils even more demands, including a halt to what Turkey deemed as \\"inciting other nations which are members of the Arab League against Turkey\\", as well as cooperation in the arrest of Ocalan. These demands were appended as an annex to the text of the agreement. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad rejected the notion that the agreement was signed under pressure, stating that he had agreed to it as he had decided it would be best for Syria \\"to be friends with the Turkish people\\", which he thought was not reconcilable with Syrian support for Kurdish groups.  Syrian Civil War  The Adana Agreement held until 2011, when overt Turkish support for the Syrian opposition in the context of the Syrian Civil War ended all goodwill between the two countries and the Syrian Government once again started supporting Kurdish groups as a counterweight to Turkish efforts in Syria. The Syrian government declared that Turkey had violated the understanding brought by the agreement by arming rebel groups inside Syria. In 2012 Turkish officials accused the Syrian government of providing direct support to the PKK. The Syrian government has since declared that it felt no longer bound by the agreement, but retained a \\"readiness\\" to return to it, if Turkey were to cease support for the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army and other rebel armed groups in Syria, as well as withdraw its troops from the Turkish occupied areas of northern Syria. In 2019, the agreement gained new significance due to the contemporary Turkish operations in Syrian territory.Analysis: What does the Adana deal mean for Turkey and Syria? Agreement resulted from mediation efforts by Egypt and Iran to satisfy Turkish demands that Syria end support for PKK. by Ali Younes, 23 Oct 2019.

She has won one gold, two silver, and one bronze medal for Team USA at the Paralympic Games. Early life and education Fisher grew up as an only child near Calgary, Alberta. After her parents separated, she moved to Hinsdale, Illinois, with her mother and divided her time with her father. Fisher was a walk-on at the University of Montana's NCAA Division 1 tennis team, which she played during her freshman year. While driving with her friend back to school for their sophomore year on June 30, 2002, they were both injured in a car accident. After being pulled out of the car by a witness, Fisher's left leg was amputated; her friend died due to her injuries. Less than a year after the accident, Fisher returned to the University of Montana and competed in a triathlon following a second leg surgery. Career Fisher met Paralympic cyclist Sam Kavanaugh, who inspired her to begin competing in para-cycling and eventually the USA Paralympic team. In 2010, Fisher competed in the TRI-5 classification and won the International Triathlon Union Paratriathlon World Championship in Budapest, Hungary, and won the 2010 USA Paratriathlon National Championship in the TRI-5 division. She also became the first female lower-leg amputee to complete an XTERRA off-road triathlon. Prior to leaving for the 2012 Summer Paralympics, Fisher began studying for her doctorate in physical therapy at the University of Washington. In London, she competed in Paralympic cycling, winning both a gold and silver medal. Her gold medal came in the C4 time trial and her silver in the track pursuit. The next year, Fisher won gold in the C4 classification at the 2013 UCI Para-cycling Road World Championships. As a result of winning the 2013 ITU Paratriathlon World Championships, her third world championship title, Fisher was honored by the United States Olympic Committee as USOC Athlete of the Month. She was later named to Team USA's 2015 UCI Para-cycling Road World Championships roster. In 2016, Fisher was selected to compete with Team USA at the 2016 Summer Paralympics, where she won a silver medal after losing to teammate Shawn Morelli in the C4 road timed trial. She also ended the games with a bronze medal in the 3000M individual pursuit.

This is a compromise between the fluid and compartmentalized approaches to layout order, with the non-map elements sitting \\"on top\\" of the main map. Here, the top-heavy main map is balanced by the non-map elements below. Note the use of a locator inset map and limited additional text about the projection (metadata) and sovereignty dispute (explanatory), all appropriate for a general audience. The detailed scale bar in two measurement systems facilitates precise distance measurements by an international audience, which may or may not be the intent. Page layout, also called map layout or map composition, is the part of Cartographic design that involves assembling various map elements on a page. This may include the map image itself, along with titles, legends, scale indicators, inset maps, and other elements. It follows principles similar to page layout in graphic design, such as balance, gestalt, and visual hierarchy. The term map composition is also used for the assembling of features and symbols within the map image itself, which can cause some confusion; these two processes share a few common design principles but are distinct procedures in practice. Similar principles of layout design apply to maps produced in a variety of media, from large format wall maps to illustrations in books to interactive web maps, although each medium has unique constraints and opportunities.  Layout principles  Geologic map of Australia, showing a layout with a strict compartmentalized order that clearly directs attention flow. The four thematic inset maps provide visual balance with the main map, which is enlarged to maximize scale and visual hierarchy. Note also the order created by arranging the title and legend consistently in all five maps (thanks to Australia's \\"serendipitous geography\\" providing spaces for non-map elements), which eases use but can look a little dull. The detailed legends and extensive metadata text block are designed for highly specialized use by a scientific audience. While much of cartographic design is constrained by geographic reality (i.e., things are what they are and where they are), the cartographer has more freedom in layout than in designing the map image. Therefore, page layout has more in common with graphic design, with its own principles of layout, than any other aspect of cartography. Another impact of this relationship is that the cartography profession has largely adopted these principles, with relatively less unique research on the topic by academic cartographers than other aspects. The work of Rudolf Arnheim, especially his 1954 Art and visual perception, was especially influential during the formative years of academic cartography, and is still quoted as part of the canon in cartography textbooks. In practice, it is common in publishing teams for the layout portion to be executed by professional graphic designers, not cartographers. Some of the major design principles that are most applicable to map layout are:Tait, A. (2018). Visual Hierarchy and Layout. The Geographic Information Science & Technology Body of Knowledge (2nd Quarter 2018 Edition), John P. Wilson (ed.). DOI: 10.22224/gistbok/2018.2.4 * Attention flow: Map reading is a process, often a complex one, requiring the map user to glean information from the map, and make interpretations and judgments from that information. Thus, this process involves a great deal of shifting attention from one part of the page to another.Dent, Borden D., Jeffrey S. Torguson, Thomas W. Hodler, Cartography: Thematic Map Design, 6th Edition, McGraw-Hill, 2009, p.209-215 While the cartographer cannot force the reader to read the map in a particular order as one would a book page, good design can subtly influence the flow of attention in a way that facilitates the use of the map for its intended purposes, such as by reducing the amount of eye movement that needs to take place.Krygier, J. & Wood, D. (original edition 2005, latest edition 2016). Making Maps: A Visual Gide to Map Design for GIS. The Guilford Press. Examples of this include designing a map title so that it clearly conveys the map purpose and is noticed at the beginning of the process, and designing legends so that the symbols explained therein can be quickly and easily compared to the corresponding symbols in the map. * Visual hierarchy: One of the major influences on attention flow is the apparent importance of the elements on the page; what the reader will notice first, second, and so on. As with the symbols within the map image, the map image as a whole, as well as the other layout elements, carry a visual \\"weight,\\" generally determined by their contrast with the page background and surrounding elements. The cartographer's goal, therefore, is to create a visual hierarchy that matches the conceptual hierarchy of what should be most and least important, or seen first and last, according to the purpose of the map. The use of visual variables, especially size, value (darkness) and texture complexity are especially valuable in constructing a visual hierarchy, as is the wise use of negative space or white space . * Balance: In its artistic sense, balance is the feeling of the layout being evenly distributed across the page. It is analogous to the physics sense of balance, in which each of the page elements can be thought of as having weight (virtually identical to its weight in the visual hierarchy), and the \\"torque\\" created by each weight and its distance from the center of the page should sum to zero. Balance can be achieved passively, through symmetry and the even arrangement of elements (which is easier but often seen as dull), or dynamically, by arranging very different elements in different spacing, but still arriving at balance. * Order: The elements of the map can be arranged in a variety of ways; their alignment has a strong influence on the flow of attention. As in balance, a passive order is achieved by strictly aligning elements in an even and symmetrical grid pattern; this is often seen as professional but can be dull. A dynamic order introduces some randomness or unevenness in the arrangement, which can give a reaction of interest and enthusiasm, but at its extreme will look haphazard, childish, and cluttered. Another continuum of approaches to layout order varies between a compartmentalized layout, in which each element is set off from the others using neatlines and borders (establishing a clear, strongly organized order, but which often looks stilted); and a fluid layout, in which elements can overlap and flow into one another (establishing a unified, dynamic order, but which can be confusing). Layout design, therefore, is about finding a balance between these various approaches to achieve the best of both worlds. * Harmony: The elements of the map must not only do their jobs individually, but must also work together, aesthetically and functionally. Visual hierarchy, balance, and order can all be considered as aspects of harmony, but so can the judicious selection of typefaces and colors. * Gestalt Aesthetic: All of these combine to give an immediate overall impression or emotional reaction in the mind of the map viewer. This is not just a matter of beauty vs. ugliness, but can also include more practical reactions such as clear vs. cluttered, authoritative vs. suspect, or professionally crafted vs. haphazard or amateurish, that directly impact how successful the map will be in achieving its intended purposes.  Layout elements  In this map of Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah, the main map has been rotated to fit the page better; a north arrow (upper left) is necessary to avoid confusion. Note the very simple scale bar, which is effective at giving a general sense of size on a map in which users are not expected to make precise measurements. The light but non- white background color enables the use of white as a map symbol (the county boundary across the center). Also note the central box showing the location of a separate detail inset map. In addition to the map itself, there are various elements that are included in the map layout. The following are common elements of a map layout.  Negative space The background of the map may seem unimportant at first, but it plays several active roles in the use of the map. It provides \\"breathing room\\" between the map elements, and can serve to distinguish elements without the use of borders. Isolating a particular element, such as a title, by surrounding it with wide white space increases its contrast with its surroundings, elevating it in the visual hierarchy. Most importantly, the background color establishes a baseline with which the map symbols and other elements contrast, establishing the entire visual hierarchy. Four approaches to background color are common: * The traditional white background of paper maps makes darker elements stand out more. * A dark background, which has gained popularity recently, especially in Web mapping, with important thematic elements being symbolized with bright or pale colors to make them \\"glow.\\" * A medium background, such as a shaded relief image, enables both black and white symbols to stand out, although if not executed well it can also produce a \\"muddy\\" appearance in which nothing stands out very much. * A high contrast background is sometimes used in coastal areas to emphasize the figure-ground contrast between land and water. It essentially partitions the map into a light background land and a dark background sea, which presents challenges for consistent design but can produce a striking effect.  Main Map  The primary element on a map page is almost always the map image itself. Placing it in the top of the visual hierarchy is typically done by making it large enough to fill the page, centrally placed, and due to its tendency to be more complex than other elements on the page. Enlarging the map also gives it the maximum possible scale, which maximizes the ability to clearly show detail in the map.  Legend  Legend that features point, line, and area symbols and follows rules for grouping Legends define the meaning of the map's symbols, especially those that are not already intuitive or obvious. In addition, a legend may also serve other purposes, including: organizing the symbols into a structure of layers and importance; educating about the subject matter; or describing how the map symbology was created. The legend may also give details about the variable being displayed, publication, or authorship. Often, the legend is critical to understanding a map, so it is important that legends are designed effectively. Using principles of gestalt, various sets of rules have been created for legend spacing, alignment, and grouping.  Title  Titles should be short and to the point. They typically include information about the location of the map and the subject of the map. The title should be an important part of the layout's visual hierarchy because the title tells people what the map is about.  Scale  Scale is important to include on a map because it explains the size relationship between map features and the real world. Scale is commonly represented with a scale bar, a representative fraction (\\"1:100,000\\"), or a verbal scale (\\"1 inch = 1 mile\\"). The preferred type of scale indicator depends on the purpose and audience of the map: a representative fraction is precise, but most of the public does not know what it means; a very precisely marked scale bar is most useful when distance measurements need to be made, but can be overkill when they do not; many general-audience maps, such as web street maps or atlases, use very simple single-division scale bars to simply give a sense of size. This seismic hazards map uses extension inset maps to display Alaska and Hawaii.  Inset map  Inset maps are smaller maps that are included on the same page as the main map. They can show additional information related to the main map. Four types of inset maps are common: * A Locator map is of a significantly smaller scale than the main map, and is used to show the location of the main map within a larger context. They are especially important with an audience who does not know where the mapped region is located. * A Detail inset is of a significantly larger scale than the main map, to show detail in a more complex portion of the main map. * A Thematic inset is used to show a different, but related theme, usually covering the same region as the main map. * An Extension inset shows the same thematic content in a non-contiguous area, such as the common insets of Alaska and Hawaii in maps of the United States.  North arrow  North arrows orient readers and tell them which way the map is facing. They are especially important in areas that map viewers are not familiar with, or when the map is oriented such that north is not up. In other cases, they may be unnecessary, especially when the geography is well-known. North arrows can be very complex or very simple. Map of part of the South Shetland Islands in Antarctica, using several photographs to illustrate the mapped landscape, as well as text blocks for explanatory and metadata purposes. This is a relatively effective use of a high contrast background (highlighting the ice cover), although it does present some challenges, such as the green areas that appear as much like ocean as land.  Text  Supplementary text is used to provide context or explain the map or other map elements. Thematic mapping often uses text to add content that supports the purpose of the map, such as explanations or interpretations of the patterns seen therein. A particular type of text block is the map metadata, which provides background information about the construction of the map. It may be as simple as a citation of the data sources, but could also include information such as the choice of Map projection, authorship credit, copyrights, date of production and/or source data, and construction methods used, chosen based on the purpose and audience.  Images  Non-map images can be added to a layout for a variety of reasons. It can offer a photo view of the area modeled in the map so that a reader can see the location looks like. Images can also be used to show examples of data points or illustrate the methods used to create the map. Logos of agencies or companies sponsoring the map are also a common use of images on layout.  Charts  Charts and graphs can provide a non-spatial view of data to support the purpose map. This allows for data to be visualized in ways that may be more appropriate than a map, such as change over time.

William Henry Coombs (November 1816 ‚Äì 22 September 1896), remembered as \\"Canon Coombs\\", was an Anglican minister in Gawler, South Australia, whose record of 48 years serving the same parish has been recognised as an Australian record. History Coombs was born in New Windsor, England or Marlborough, Wiltshire, the son of an ironmonger or a banker, and early attracted to the church. He taught Sunday School in London alongside Rev. E. K. Miller; both read for holy orders under Rev. W. J. Woodcock, and trained for overseas service at St Bee's College. Following an appeal from the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts in 1846, Woodcock and James Pollitt left for missionary service in Australia. In 1846 Coombs had just begun his church career as curate of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, Trafalgar Square, London, when he was approached by the S.P.G. to follow them, as the Gawler church needed a minister. He was ordained deacon by Bishop Blomfield of London at St Paul's Cathedral. With his new wife, Coombs left for Australia in July 1846. Arriving in Sydney, he was licensed by Bishop Broughton of Sydney, and traveled on to Adelaide, arriving on 14 November and attended St John's Church the following day and Trinity Church the next week. The week after he conducted Gawler's first Anglican service, in Stephen King's \\"Victoria Mill\\" on Jacob Street. They would later meet in Murphy's schoolroom while waiting for the new church building. Coombs and his wife moved into \\"Floraville\\", Younghusband's property in North Gawler, where they stayed until 1848, when the parsonage in Gawler East was completed. His church, St George's is one of the oldest in the diocese, the first building having been consecrated on 21 March 1848 by Short. On 29 June that year, in the first such ceremony in South Australia, he was ordained priest by Bishop Short at Trinity Church. In 1854 he was appointed Rural Dean of Gawler and minor Canon of the Adelaide Cathedral in 1858. The foundation stone of what would be the first Anglican church north of Adelaide was laid on 4 March 1847 by Governor Robe, and on 28 March 1848 the building was consecrated by Bishop Short. There were problems with the building's construction, and in any case the congregation had outgrown it, and a replacement became imperative. On 6 June 1858 the foundation stone of its replacement was laid by Mrs Short. Gawler's second Anglican church was designed by E. A. Hamilton in Early English style. The foundation stone was laid on 6 January 1858 but the bishop refused consecration of the building due to the trust-deed, which gave church trustees veto power over management decisions, where the Model Trust Deed vested decision-making in congregation and synod. The transept, which had been provided for by Hamilton, had its foundation stone laid on 4 December 1884, and the building was consecrated on 23 April 1895 by Bishop Kennion. The tower and bells, so much desired by Coombs, would not be erected until after his death. Coombs, in little short of 50 years had seen the church grow from an outpost in the bush to a centrepiece of a cultured community, a \\"Colonial Athens\\". > The rev. gentleman was possessed of a good deal of native dignity and > culture, was thoroughly devoted to his Church, and was loved by those who > were associated with him. He died suddenly, having conducted the Sunday service then fallen ill on the Tuesday, and died in the night with the doctor in attendance, heart failure and bronchitis having been the diagnosis. The east window, a lead-glass work depicting the Ascension by Herbert M. Smyrk at the Gawler studio of E. F. Troy and unveiled on 4 May 1898, was dedicated to his memory. Family Coombs married Eliza ( ‚Äì 31 July 1898) before July 1846. They had no children.

As a single mother in her twenties Gallagher was accepted into a training scheme for young Aboriginal people at the Museum of Victoria. She worked on the return of the Murray Black Collection and served as manager of the heritage branch of Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Victoria) before taking up a position at VACCHO in 1998. In 2017 Gallagher was appointed Commissioner of the Victorian Treaty Advancement Commission until the voting period ended in October 2019. Gallagher was inducted into the Victorian Honour Roll of Women in 2009 and the Victorian Aboriginal Honour Roll in 2015. She was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2013. Early life Gallagher was born in 1955, one of 10 children, in the Australian Capital Territory, principally recognised as Ngunnawal Country. Her mother was a Gunditjmara woman and a father of Irish decent. Gallagher's father died in an accident when she was a baby. Work available to Aboriginal people was limited and Gallagher's mother travelled extensively for seasonal work picking vegetables. Gallagher spent much of her early childhood in Gunaikurnai country, Gippsland, her community revolved around the seasonal camps inhabited by other seasonal workers. In 1963 Gallagher's family moved to Collingwood on Wurundjeri Country, where her mother found work in a box factory. Gallagher graduated from the George Street Primary School after attending 13 different schools, and continued her education at the Fitzroy Girls' School. She was rebellious, clashed with teachers, left school at the age of 14 and ran away from home, living on the streets before returning home and commencing work in a factory. Early memories include living in a camp on Braiakaulung country on the Avon River at Stratford dotted by the glow of dozens of campfires, and her mother being asked to leave a whites only hotel in Warnambool. Career In her early twenties, and a single mother, Gallagher regretted leaving school at an early age. She applied for, and was accepted into a training scheme for Aboriginal young people at the Museum of Victoria. She took up a position at the Victoria Archaeological Survey, which offered her the opportunity to learn about Aboriginal history including culture, language and the devastating effect of European settlement had on Aboriginal people. She took on a role as manager of the heritage branch of Aboriginal Affairs Victoria which enabled her to pass her knowledge on to young people. While with Museums Victoria Gallagher worked on the return of the Murray Black Collection, to Aboriginal communities in northern Victoria and Southern New South Wales. She continues to serve on the National Committee for the Repatriation of Skeletal Remains. In 1998 Gallagher took a position at the Victorian Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (VACCHO), and in 2001 she became its CEO. She quickly recognised tobacco as a major cause of health problems within the Aboriginal community and, in 2008, gave up smoking after 40 years. She actively encouraged VACCO employees and each Aboriginal health organisation in Victoria to develop a stop smoking campaign and to become smoke free. The idea was to provide leadership in aboriginal communities, and reduce the burden on a stretched health services. As CEO of VACCHO Gallagher obtained bi-partisan support from the Victorian Government for the statement of intent to close the 17 year life expectancy gap between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. The statement was signed in 2008 by Victorian Premier John Brumby. She lists this as one of her most significant achievements as CEO of VACCHO. In January 2018 Gallagher took 18 months leave of absence from VACCHO when she was appointed Commissioner of the Victorian Treaty Advancement Commission. The commission was set up to create an Aboriginal representative body to establish rules for future treaty negotiations with the Victorian Government. The commission will be wound up once the representative body is formed. In 2009 Gallagher was diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer which had spread to her liver and diaphragm. She had two surgeries and chemotherapy and has used her experience to promote cancer awareness in the Aboriginal community. Gallagher has served on a number of state government and statutory advisory committees, including the Victorian Early Childhood Development Advisory Committee, the Equal Opportunity Commission Victoria Indigenous Reference Group, the Child Death Review, the Cooperative Research Centre on Aboriginal Health, and the Premiers Aboriginal Advisory Committee. Gallagher has cited mentors Jim Berg of the Koorie Heritage Trust and Terry Garwood of Aboriginal Affairs Victoria as great influencers, but is inspired mostly by her mother for her resilience and determination in the face of the hardship she endured.

Identified by the distinctive development of stroma, this pathogen in itself is of little economic importance in the production of corn. However, the accompanying fungal infection of Monographella maydis, identified by ‚Äúfish-eye‚Äù lesions, causes significant foliar damage and subsequently yield reduction. Symptoms and signs This pathogen is an obligate parasite solely of the species Zea mays. The first symptoms are yellowing spots on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. Within the spot develops the characteristic black stromata over the ascomata, along with the chlorosis of surrounding tissue. The chlorotic rings may be eliptical, circular, or may conjoin to form striping up to 10 mm long. Some of the chlorotic tissue around the ascomata may become necrotic with darker edges, forming the indicative 3-8mm ‚Äúfish-eye‚Äù. The presence of these lesions is not universal, nor is the association of these lesions with M. maydis. Research is ongoing to determine the exact cause of these lesions. Symptoms have been recorded as early as V3, but are most commonly observed during R3-R6 on or below the ear leaves. Disease cycle Little is known about the progression of Phyllachora maydis. Presently, it is believed that the stromata overwinter on corn and soil residue. This is the primary inoculum that must be destroyed if the cycle is to be interrupted. Providing optimal temperatures, humidity and rainfall however, ascospores and conidia will be released in a gelatinous mass on the stromata. Both wind and precipitation are used to disperse the spores; however it is solely the ascospores that infect other plants. The role of conidia in the reproductive cycle is still unknown. The ascospores are released in bunches, and can travel as much as 80 yards with wind dispersion. Following infection, new stromata can form within 12-15 days in infected tissue, producing additional ascospores and conidia. Given the polycyclic nature of this pathogen, as well as the ability to infect corn at any developmental stage, it is extremely hard to manage. The pathogen progresses from the lower leaves to the upper leaves and husks. As many as 4000 clypeus may form on a leaf, resulting in 80% of affected leaf area. Given optimal conditions, total leaf death can occur in as little as twenty one days. Environment In Latin America, the disease propagated quickly in temperatures ranging from 60-70 degrees Fahrenheit with high humidity. Long periods of moisture on the leaf surface also increased the disease incidence. However, in the Midwest, it is still unknown as to the conditions that are preferred by the pathogen. During 2015 and 2018 when there was a high incidence of tar spot, the weather was warmer with high humidity and precipitation frequency, possibly attributing to the increased number of cases reported. Additional research is needed to understand the optimal conditions for propagation of this disease in the Midwest. Management A basic control measure that could be implemented is residue management. By tilling the field and rotating crops, this helps reduce the primary inoculum that overwinters on stalks and other residue. A biological control method that has shown potential is the infection with Coniothyrium phyllochorae by reducing lesion size due to hyperparasitism. Chemical control with one or two treatments of Fenpropimorph or Mancozeb applied every ten days were the most effective fungicides used in field trials. Although no cultivars currently exist that are immune to this pathogen, CIMMYT has developed 14 inbred lines in Latin America that are highly resistant. However, most hybrids used in the Midwest have proven susceptible. Importance Tar spot appeared in Wisconsin in Green and Iowa counties in 2016, and had become a serious problem by 2018. When surveyed by the University and DATCP, it was found that 33 counties had recorded cases, and 77 of 79 fields surveyed, or 97 percent, showed signs. Tar spot causes low ear weight, vivipary, and poor kernel fill resulting in up to a 30 bushel loss per acre. Increased lodging and stalk rot have also been associated with intense cases.

The program ended after seventeen episodes.Alex McNeil, Total Television, New York: Penguin Books, 1996, 4th ed., p. 190 Maunder's next series was a second western, CBS's Lancer, with co-stars Andrew Duggan, James Stacy, and Paul Brinegar. Lancer ran from 1968 to 1970, with an additional rebroadcast cycle in the summer of 1971.McNeil, Total Television, pp. 461-462 Maunder's last regular series, Chase, is a 21-episode drama about an undercover police unit which aired on NBC during the 1973-1974 television season, co-starring Mitchell Ryan as Chase Reddick and Reid Smith as officer Norm Hamilton.McNeil, Total Television, p. 157 Maunder played the role of police Sergeant Sam MacCray, one of whose duties was to handle the police dog named \\"Fuzz\\". A Jack Webb production, Chase was created by Stephen J. Cannell.  Early years and actor's training  Maunder was born in Four Falls in the Canadian province of New Brunswick, but was reared, along with four siblings, in Bangor, the seat of Penobscot County, Maine, where he moved when he was four years old, and which he considered to be his hometown. His mother was Lydia Maunder (1913‚Äì1980). Maunder graduated in 1957 from Bangor High School, where he played football and baseball. He attempted to enter Major League Baseball but failed in tryouts with the Milwaukee Braves, San Francisco Giants, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Maunder then spent a few years in the United States Naval Reserve and went on a training mission on the aircraft carrier, the USS Leyte. He studied English literature plus drama at El Camino College Compton Center, then known as Compton Junior College in Compton, California. He participated in an amateur play and was soon bitten by the acting bug. He headed to Broadway and studied in 1961 under Stella Adler during the day and waited tables at Grand Central Station in the evenings. He participated in stock companies and acted in productions of Hamlet, Othello, and Much Ado About Nothing with the American Shakespeare Company on Long Island. In 1965, while acting in a role in The Knack at the Red Barn Theater on Long Island, at a salary of $100 per week plus room and board, Maunder signed a contract with a management agency. Maunder made his first ever screen appearance on February 4, 1967, as Michael Duquesne in the episode \\"Race for the Rainbow\\" of the ABC western The Monroes, starring Michael Anderson, Jr., and Barbara Hershey. Maunder was credited as John Wilder on The Monroes but decided thereafter to return to his own name.  As Custer  Maunder returned to Los Angeles, where he secured his first screen role under his real name, as Lt. Col. Custer in the eponymous 20th Century Fox production. He grew a moustache to accompany his long blond hair for the part of the American Indian Wars icon. The short- lived series, which took over The Monroes time slot, involved many stunts and difficult parts, but was quickly defeated by The Virginian, and Lost in Space on CBS, and dropped from the ABC schedule by the end of 1967.  As Scott Lancer  The fictitious Scott Lancer was born in California, but reared in Boston, Massachusetts, by his maternal grandfather, Harlan Garrett. A Civil War veteran, Scott was a lieutenant in the cavalry under General Philip Sheridan. He spent time in a Confederate States of America prisoner of war camp. He attended Harvard University near Boston and was once engaged to a girl named Julie Dennison. By contrast to Scott, Johnny Lancer, played by James Stacy, Scott's half-brother, was born to a Mexican woman and had been a gunslinger under the name \\"Johnny Madrid\\" for several years before he attempted to settle down on the family's Lancer ranch. As the educated older son of Andrew Duggan's patriarchial figure of Murdoch Lancer, Maunder wore short hair and removed the moustache from his Custer role. Like Custer, Lancer was a 20th Century Fox production and also required action scenes and horseback-riding.  Other acting appearances  Between Custer and Lancer, Maunder appeared on three ABC series: the pilot episode of Kung Fu series with David Carradine, twice on The F.B.I. with Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., as Knox in \\"Time Bomb\\" (1970) and as Earl Gainey in \\"The Fatal Showdown\\" (1972), and as Don Pierce in the episode \\"Crossfire\\" of the police drama The Rookies (1973). Maunder appeared as attorney Mike Barrett in the 1971 20th Century Fox film The Seven Minutes, a drama about a banned book and a rape which created chaos in a town. His costars included Philip Carey, John Carradine, Jay C. Flippen, Harold J. Stone, and Tom Selleck. The film was directed by Russ Meyer. After Chase, Maunder appeared in four remaining guest-starring roles: NBC's Police Story (twice in 1975), a creation of Joseph Wambaugh, ABC's The Streets of San Francisco with Karl Malden (1977), as Deputy Burt Campbell in the 1979 episode \\"Copy-Cat Killings\\" in Buddy Ebsen's CBS series Barnaby Jones, and as Cavanaugh in the film Porky's (1982).

Its common name is common satin grass or wirestem muhly. It is informally grouped with other satin grasses, which are other species in Muhlenbergia. It is a warm-season C4-photosynthetic grass.  Taxonomy  Muhlenbergia frondosa is a member of the genus Muhlenbergia. It is a flowering plant, monocot, and a member of the grass family Poaceae. The genus Muhlenbergia was named after the German-educated Lutheran minister and botanist Gotthilf Heinrich Ernst Muhlenberg, who classified and named 150 species of plants in his 1785 work Index Flora Lancastriensis. Synonyms of M. frondosa include Agrostis frondosa Poir. and Muhlenbergia commutata (Scribn.) Bush.  Description  This is a perennial grass growing about , forming short, lateral branches along the central culm. It usually sprawls across the ground or onto neighboring vegetation. It has a yellow bloom, which in Texas, occurs from March to May. In Illinois, however, the blooming period occurs during late summer to autumn, lasting around 1-3 weeks for one colony of plants. The florets are cross-pollinated by the wind. Florets drop individually.leaving behind the glumes. The fruit (grains) are 1.6-1.9 mm long, from amber to brown.  Distribution  Muhlenbergia frondosa occurs in most of the central and eastern United States. It naturally inhabits moist to wet forest margins and openings, freshwater littoral habitats, and grasslands. It is invasive in some parts of Canada.  Ecology  According to Illinois Wildflowers, M. frondosa is associated with a variety of animals that feed on or use it as refuge. It is preyed on by insects from dipterans to true bugs. Larvae of a gall fly, Astictoneura agrostis, form scaly galls on this plant. Other larvae that feed on this grass include that of gall wasp (Eurytomocharis muhlenbergiae), grass fly (Homaluroides ingratus), and stink bug (Hymenarcys nervosa). Adult insects feeding on the grass include leafhoppers (Plesiommata tripunctata and Flexamia imputans), and aphids (Schizaphis muhlenbergia and Anoecia cornicola). Additionally, the seeds are probably eaten by birds, and the grass is grazed by cattle and other ungulates. M. frondosa grows in dense clusters, which provide cover for small fauna such as rodents, reptiles, and arthropods.  Management  This grass can be weedy and invasive. It can infest crops of corn and soybean reducing yields in southern Canada and the Midwest to Northeastern United States. It is comparatively shade tolerant, can regrow from rhizomes, and produces abundant seeds. However it is controllable with herbicides, best timed for active growth stages Though it can spread to places where it is unwanted, it is not very aggressive and is slow to develop.

It is the first smartphone lineup to receive USB fast-charger certification from the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF).  History  The title of the phone was originally presumed to be the Galaxy S11, due to it being the logical extension from the predecessor. However, successive leaks in January 2020 revealed the title of the phone to be the Galaxy S20, because of the multiples of 10, rather than 1. In addition, details regarding the phone were leaked widely before the release, to the extent that almost all details regarding the specifications and design of the phone were known before the release. Leaker Max Weinbach obtained the actual phone a month before the release, confirming everything the community already guessed. Commentators remarked that by February, \\"most everything the company is planning to introduce has already leaked out.\\" In addition to charts on the phone's specifications, marketing material and images of the phones themselves in real-life were leaked.  Design  The Galaxy S20 series maintains a similar design with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10, with an Infinity-O display (first introduced on the Galaxy S10) containing a circular punch-hole in the top center for the frontal selfie camera. In a departure from past Galaxy S designs, the rear camera array is not centered, but located in the corner with a rectangular protrusion similar to that of the iPhone 11 and the Google Pixel 4. The S20 and S20+ house three or four cameras respectively in the bump, while the S20 Ultra houses four cameras in a larger bump. Global color options are Cloud Pink, Cloud White, Cloud Blue, Cosmic Grey and Cosmic Black. Cosmic Grey is available in all size variants, while Cosmic Black is limited to the S20+ and S20 Ultra, Cloud Blue is limited to the S20 and S20+, and Cloud Pink is exclusive to the S20. For the S20+, Prism Blue, is exclusively sold at Best Buy in the United States and through T-Mobile and Tele2 in the Netherlands, while Aura Red is exclusive to Korea Telecom. Cloud White availability varies by country; in the United States it is exclusive to Verizon for the S20 with Ultrawide Band support. The S20 is sold in Italy, the S20+ is sold in Italy and Spain, and the S20 Ultra is sold in China and Germany. In June 2020, Verizon released the Galaxy S20 5G UW (Ultra Wideband). Differences from the S20 include the addition of mmWave, only 8 GB of RAM (compared to the usual 12 GB), and no MicroSD slot. Moreover, Samsung released the Galaxy S20+ 5G BTS Edition in summer 2020, with the color \\"Haze Purple.\\"  Specifications   Hardware  = Chipsets = The S20 line comprises three models with various hardware specifications; international models of the S20 utilize the Exynos 990 system-on-chip, while the U.S., Canadian, Korean, Chinese and Japanese models utilize the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865. = Display = A 1440p \\"Dynamic AMOLED\\" is featured with HDR10+ support and \\"dynamic tone mapping\\" technology. The S20 and S20+ have a 6.2-inch display and a 6.7-inch display, respectively, while the S20 Ultra has a 6.9-inch display. The displays have curved sides that slope over the horizontal edges of the device, and a wider 20:9 aspect ratio is used in addition to a 120 Hz refresh rate double that of the S10. All models utilize an ultrasonic in-screen fingerprint sensor. = Storage = The base amount of RAM is 8 GB, with an additional 12 GB option for the S20 & S20+ and a 16 GB option for the S20 Ultra. 128 GB of internal storage is standard and the S20+ & S20 Ultra also offers 128 GB, 256 GB and 512 GB options, with up to 1 TB of expansion via the microSD card slot. Verizon's Galaxy S20 5G UW model is not equipped with a microSD slot. = Batteries = The S20, S20+ & S20 Ultra contain non-removable 4000 mAh, 4500 mAh, and 5000 mAh Li-Po batteries respectively, and Qi inductive charging is supported at up to 15W as well as the ability to charge other Qi-compatible devices from the S20's own battery power, which is branded as ‚ÄúSamsung PowerShare‚Äù. Wired charging is supported over USB-C at up to 25W for the S20 & S20+ and 45W for the S20 Ultra.GSMArena specification sheets of the three Galaxy S20 variants = Connectivity = The S20 series comes with 5G standard connectivity, though some regions may have special LTE variants. However, only Verizon models are compatible with ultra-fast millimeter-wave networks, and the audio jack has been omitted entirely. = Cameras = The cameras on the Galaxy S20 series improved considerably over its predecessors, although unlike the S9 and S10, the aperture on the main lens is fixed. While the megapixels of the main and ultra wide sensors remained unchanged on the S20 and S20+, the telephoto sensor received some improvements. The 64-megapixel telephoto camera, branded as ‚ÄúSpace Zoom‚Äù, supports 3X hybrid optical zoom (branded as \\"Hybrid Optic Zoom\\") and 30X digital zoom at 64 megapixels on the new telephoto sensor instead of 12 megapixels at two times on the S10 and 30 times digitally (branded as \\"Super-Resolution Zoom\\"). The S20+ receives a time-of-flight sensor (branded as \\"DepthVision Camera\\") in addition to the regular S20's cameras. The Galaxy S20 Ultra has a quadruple lens setup that supports 4X optical zoom and 100X digital zoom, with a 108-megapixel wide image sensor, a 12-megapixel ultra- wide sensor and a 48-megapixel periscope telephoto sensor accompanied by a time-of-flight sensor. Both the wide-angle and telephoto sensors use pixel binning to output higher quality images at a standard resolution, with the wide-angle sensor using Nonacell technology which groups 3x3 pixels to capture more light. The front camera is able to record video footage at 2160p.GSMArena review of the Galaxy S20 video camera A new camera mode was introduced called Single Take, which allows users to capture photos or videos at the same time with different sensors automatically. All three models can also record 8K videos at 24fps with a bit rate of 80 Mbps, which will consume about 600 MB of storage per minute. On the S20 and S20+, this is enabled by the 64 MP telephoto sensor, whereas the S20 Ultra's 108 MP wide sensor natively supports 8K video  Software  All three phones run on Android 10 and Samsung's custom skin One UI 2.1.

During the time of Vichy France, he was arrested and transported with his wife from his homeland to Auschwitz Concentration Camp where they were killed. Biography Zadoc-Kahn was born on 2 September 1870, in the 3rd arrondissement of Paris. He was one of six children of Ernestine Meyer and Zadoc Kahn, the Chief Rabbi of France; his sisters were H√©l√®ne, Anne and Berthe; his brothers were Paul and Edmond. He began a medical career as an intern in Paris hospitals from 1892. He qualified as a medical doctor in 1897. In 1899, he married Suzanne Esther Lang, who was born on 26 March 1876 in Paris to Fleurette Silz Lang and Ernest Lang, a textile manufacturer. He is recorded on his marriage certificate as being a doctor at H√¥tel-Dieu de Paris. They had three children, Bertrand, Jacqueline and Jean. In 1914, he became the Chief Medical Officer of the Rothschild Hospital and remained in that role until his murder. He was a board member and assistant treasurer of the Curie Foundation in 1924, and later treasurer. In 1915, during World War I, he travelled as a military doctor aboard the hospital ship, the Sphinx, as part of the Allied Powers' expedition to Salonika, to rally the large Jewish population of the city to the Allied cause, to help the beleaguered (mostly French) troops; this resulted in the creation of the Macedonian front. He had the rank of major in 1918 and was awarded the Croix de Guerre and the Cross of the Order of St. Sava (from Serbia). In 1923, his wife Suzanne co-founded the Jewish Women's Union for Palestine with feminist advocate Yvonne Netter; the Union later became the French section of the Women's International Zionist Organization. In 1925, he became one of the eight-member editorial board of La Revue juive (The Jewish Review) - a short-lived journal begun by Albert Cohen, the aim of which was to be at the political centre of the perceived contemporary Jewish renaissance; - other members included Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Georg Brandes and Charles Gide. Upon the defeat of France to Nazi forces in 1940, Zadoc-Kahn's son, Bertrand, a cardiologist at the American Hospital of Paris shot himself in despair. Katharine Graham, owner of The Washington Post, wrote how her father, Eugene Meyer, the American financier and cousin of Zadoc-Kahn who had lived with him for six months, offered to resettle his family to the U.S.A. as he had with others. Zadoc-Kahn and his wife were too devastated at their son's suicide and declined the offer. The couple went into hiding in a village on the outskirts of Paris; their daughter, Jacqueline, was hidden by a catholic family. Annette Benacerraf, Zadoc-Kahn's grand-niece, related to her husband (Nobel laureate, Baruj Benacerraf) how one of his last known addresses in France was in Le Ruel, Haravilliers in Seine-et-Oise, north-west of Paris (now part of the Val d'Oise d√©partement) and from here a letter was sent by Zadoc-Kahn to D√©sir√©e Damengout, a nursing colleague at the Rothschild Hospital, containing the following: \\"I beg you to convey my wishes to all my friends on Santerre Street, nurses and doctors. If you have the time, I will be very happy to hear from you and all of you.\\" The couple was discovered in a house at Marines, Seine et Oise, on 1 November 1943 by the French gendarm√©rie and taken away. They were transported on Convoy No. 62, on 20 November, from Le Camp de Drancy (Drancy internment camp) to Auschwitz [most of the approximately 76,000 French Jews who were rounded up and sent to German concentration camps went through Drancy]. They were killed on their arrival at Auschwitz on 23 November. Meyer found out about their arrest and disappearance from Adolphe Dreyfus in New York in the spring of 1944. He kept a portrait of Zadoc-Kahn in his New York home. Jacqueline Zadoc-Kahn survived the war.

The name, \\"Harlem\\", is a nickname for their local area of Kennington. The police allege that Harlem Spartans is a gang, however this is denied by the group. Harlem Spartans is affiliated with Camberwell-based group Moscow17. Australian drill group Onefour cites Harlem Spartans as a major influence in their music.  History  Beginnings (2014‚Äì2018) Harlem Spartans started making music in 2014, using a local youth centre as a music studio. Most artists within Harlem Spartans are from Kennington, with many of them going to Tenison‚Äôs School in Oval. Musically, like much of UK drill music, their music contains references to their local area, violence, references to beef with other groups, and is often riddled with slang. The group is known for its beef with Brixton-based group 410. The beef has been expressed through various diss tracks, and has at times escalated to physical violence. 410 member AM released the song \\"Attempted 1.0\\" in 2018. The song contained many direct references to violence towards Harlem Spartans members. Skengdo & AM, members of 410, were later given a gang injunction from the police that banned them from entering Kennington or mentioning rival gangs in their music. Rise to fame and success of Harlem Spartans (2018‚Äìpresent) Prominent songs from the group include \\"Call Me a Spartan\\", \\"Kennington Where It Started\\", and Loski's songs \\"Cool Kid\\", \\"Hazards\\", and \\"Forrest Gump\\", the latter of which entered the charts.

The species was first described by Ingrid A. Lotta, Valki≈´nas Gediminas, M. Andre√≠na Pacheco, Anan√≠as A. Escalante, Sandra Roc√≠o Hern√°ndez and Nubia E. Matta in 2019. Leucocytozoon grallariae is spread throughout in the Andean mountain ranges normally in humid forests and scrublands of Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela. They contain gametocytes within fusiform host cells. However, it's been determined that these parasites are present in co-infections with other species belonging to the genus Leucocytozoon. In this parasite, gametocytes develop in circular shaped host cells which exhibits two highly distant parasite lineages isolated from the same samples.(Lotta et al. 2019) Young gametocytes have an effect on the shape of host cells starting at primal stages of their development. Parasites that are growing have oval or ellipsoid shapes; these parasites stick to the host cell nuclei, which are enlarged, deformed and have a crescent shape. The host's cell cytoplasm near growing gametocytes. Advanced young gametocytes have invaginations lining their sides. This is opposite to the host cell nuclei, which gives the growing gametocytes the appearance of giant beans with rounded ends. Host cells take on the ellipsoid shape from the very early stages of gametocyte development. The rest of the life cycle follows the same as the rest of the Leucocytozoon species.

Background  In the preceding months, attacks by the Islamic State in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger have worsened with large scale firearm assaults on both the civilian population and armed forces. In November, gunmen killed over 50 soldiers in the 2019 Indelimane attack in the M√©naka Region of Mali. A week later in Burkina Faso, gunmen stormed a convoy of buses for the Boungou miners, killing 37, although some estimate the death toll to be much higher. This attack happened after an attack on another Niger post which resulted in the killing of three Nigerian soldiers and 14 of the assailants.  Attack  A large group of gunmen stormed the base firing mortars and shooting as many soldiers as possible. The attackers included suicide bombers. The spokesman for the ministry stated that many of the attackers were neutralized by friendly forces. The attack killed 71 soldiers and injured 12 others. 30 more soldiers remained missing after the attack. Following this attack, the president, Mahamadou Issoufou, decided to cancel his trip to Egypt.  Aftermath  On 12 December, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack through its local branch.

It is named after the nearby city gate, Bab Doukkala, in the western city walls. It is also known as the al-Hurra Mosque (or Mosque of the Free One, in reference to its founder, Massa'uda al-Wizkitiya).  Historical background  Fountain of the Bab Doukkala Mosque. Door of the Bab Doukkala Mosque. It was commissioned by Lalla Mas'uda bint Ahmad, a daughter of Muhammad al-Sheikh (the founder of the Saadian Dynasty) and mother of Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur, during the Saadian Dynasty. Construction of the mosque began in 1557-58 CE (965 AH) and probably finished around 1570-71 CE (979 AH), which would have been under the reign of Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib. Lalla Ma'suda's status as a powerful and \\"free\\" or independent woman may have given the mosque its alternate name of Jami' al-Hurra (\\"Mosque of Freedom\\"). In 1557-58 CE the sultan had ordered that the Jewish population of the city relocate to an area closer to the Kasbah (royal citadel), resulting in the creation of a Jewish mellah which continued to exist into modern times. Construction of the new mellah was probably finished around 1562-63. Meanwhile, the emptying of the old Jewish neighbourhoods had liberated a large amount of space within the city which was open to redevelopment. The Bab Doukkala Mosque, along with the Mouassine Mosque built around the same time, appears to have been part of a larger plan to build new \\"model\\" neighbourhoods in the area. It was conceived as part of a coherent religious and civic complex which included, in addition to the mosque itself, a madrasa, library, hammam (public bathhouse) with latrines, and a public fountain for distributing water to the locals. This type of architectural complex was unprecedented in Morocco, and may have been influenced by the tradition of building such complexes in Mamluk Egypt and in the Ottoman Empire.

The type and only species is Asfaltovenator vialidadi.  Discovery  Skull of Asfaltovenator In 2002, technician Leandro Canesa, roughly a mile north of Cerro Condor, discovered a theropod skeleton. Excavations started in 2005. In 2007, the fossil was in its entirety removed as an enormous stone block, covered by plaster of Paris. It was then prepared by Mariano Caffa, a process that took five years due to the extreme hardness of the stone matrix. Between 2013 and 2015, it was compared with the specimens of related theropods, researchers personally investigating their exemplars in collections all over the world.https://www.lanacion.com.ar/ciencia/asfaltovenator-vialidadi-hallan- patagonia-uno-mas-antiguos-nid2314701 In 2019, the type species Asfaltovenator vialidadi was named and described by Oliver Walter Mischa Rauhut and Diego Pol. The generic name combines a reference to the Ca√±ad√≥n Asfalto with a Latin venator, \\"hunter\\". The specific name honours the Direcci√≥n Nacional de Vialidad, for assisting the Museo Paleontol√≥gico \\"Egidio Feruglio\\" in recovering the fossil. Asfaltovenator is only known from the holotype specimen MPEF PV 3440, which was found in a layer of the Ca√±ad√≥n Asfalto Formation which dates from the late Toarcian to the Bajocian. It consists of a partial skeleton with skull. It contains the largely complete skull with lower jaws and the front half of the skeleton forward of the hips, including ten neck vertebrae, thirteen back vertebrae and the first sacral vertebra, the complete shoulder girdle minus the furcula and both forelimbs; and also the distal portion of the pubic bones as well as a partial right hindlimb consisting of the distal portion of the femur and proximal portions of the tibia and fibula, and a partial foot. Description  Size comparison Restoration of the head Asfaltovenator was a fairly large animal, with the holotype skull being seventy-five to eighty centimetres in length and the total body length being estimated at seven to eight metres. The describers indicated a number of distinguishing traits. Some of these are autapomorphies, unique derived characters. The premaxillary teeth have large serrations on the rear edge but only minute serrations on the front edge. The exoccipital bone of the rear skull shows distinctive horizontal ridges between the paraoccipital process and the foramen magnum. On the third and fourth neck vertebrae, the neural spines are triangular and swept backwards. The eleventh and twelfth back vertebrae possess an additional forward ridge on the underside of the diapophysis, the process for the articulation facet of the top rib head.  Classification  Due to its mosaic of primitive and derived characters within Tetanurae, Asfaltovenator's inclusion in the phylogenetic analysis disrupted current views of tetanuran phylogeny, with the analysis recovering Asfaltovenator as a basal allosauroid, above the Piatnitzkysauridae, and traditional Megalosauroidea as a paraphyletic grade leading to Allosauroidea. The unique combination of characteristics seen in Asfaltovenator may also indicate megalosauroids and allosauroids shared a common ancestor not shared with the tetanuran group of Coelurosauria.

This marked the first time that background music for a Kannada film was recorded in Europe. Background  In an interview with The Times of India, Ajaneesh explained, \\"We have recorded parts of the background music in Macedonia, Europe. It is not that we don't have musicians here, but we wanted a big orchestra with a string and horn section specifically. So, we decided to get the theme songs recorded from this team in Macedonia. This group has recorded with AR Rahman sir on earlier occasions. Having an epic project like Avane Srimannarayana, required an orchestra of such magnitude.\\" The background score of the film has multiple cultural inferences. Ajaneesh further stated that \\"Music plays a pivotal part in the movie, and the background score is a mix of music associated with Indian mythology, Carnatic music, and western classical with Arabic influences. While we were inspired by the themes for iconic Hollywood characters like Sherlock Holmes and Jack Sparrow, the score we have composed is original. We have about seven themes and these move with the narrative. Audiences will be able to connect and form parallels between the music and the storyline. I have also composed two songs for the film. One is an introduction song that plays out in a fight sequence at a pub. The tune has middle-eastern influences as well as the peppy strains that one would associate with cowboys. And since the storyline is set in the 1980s, I have tried to bring in an old school flavour. The song is in chaste Kannada, thanks to the lovely lyrics by Nagarjuna. The second track is a climax number, which signifies an important moment for the protagonist Narayana. The song is partly in Mayamalavagowla raga, and also has a middle- eastern strain.\\"  Release  Since the makers decided not to tie with any other music labels, Rakshit Shetty released the album through Divo, a digital streaming portal.

The congregation originally held service at a local YMCA. The first church building was constructed in 1905 near the Georgia State Capitol in downtown Atlanta. The congregation experienced significant growth during World War I as many members of St. John's became members of Redeemer due to anti-German sentiment. In 1937, the congregation moved to its current location at the intersection of Peachtree Street and Fourth Street in midtown Atlanta, near Saint Mark Methodist Church. This building was nicknamed the \\"Church of the Lighted Window\\" because it had a large stained glass window featuring the Good Shepherd facing Peachtree Street. The current building, a gothic structure built primarily of Tennessee quartzite and Indiana limestone, was constructed in 1952 and was designed by Harold E. Wagoner, a notable ecclesiastical architect. The building's dedication occurred on September 7 of that year. In 2002, the church dedicated a new pipe organ built by Orgues L√©tourneau Limit√©e: the Opus 80. Early in its history, Redeemer became affiliated with the United Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the South. Through a series of church unions, Redeemer is a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and is the largest congregation within the church's Southeastern Synod.

It shares its name with the Mouassine neighbourhood.  History   Background  The mosque was commissioned by the Saadian sultan Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib. Construction took place between 1562-63 CE (970 AH) and 1572-73 CE (980 AH). In 1557-58 CE the sultan had ordered that the Jewish population of the city relocate to an area closer to the Kasbah (royal citadel), resulting in the creation of a new Jewish mellah which continued to exist into modern times. Construction of the mellah was probably finished around 1562-63. Meanwhile, the emptying of the old Jewish neighbourhoods had liberated a large amount of space within the city which was open to redevelopment. The Mouassine Mosque, along with the Bab Doukkala Mosque built around the same time, appears to have been part of a larger plan to build new \\"model\\" neighbourhoods in this area and spur an urban renewall of Marrakesh. Like the Bab Doukkala Mosque, it was conceived as part of a coherent religious and civic complex which included, in addition to the mosque itself, a madrasa, a library, a primary school, a hammam (public bathhouse), an ablutions house (mida'a) with latrines, a water trough for animals, and a public fountain for distributing water to locals. This type of architectural complex was unprecedented in Morocco, and may have been influenced by the tradition of building such complexes in Mamluk Egypt and in the Ottoman Empire. The mosque was built on top of a former Jewish cemetery, which caused some Jewish inhabitants of the city to avoid walking near the mosque for fear of unknowingly walking over an impure space where bodies were buried. According to one historical source, some Muslim worshipers were also put off by this and avoided attending prayers at the mosque. The latter claim is not backed up by other historical chronicles, but may have a part in explaining why the mosque did not gain greater prominence as a major mosque of the city.  Origin of the name  The origin of the name \\"Mouassine\\" is popularly attributed to a Sharifian family which supposedly lived in the district, which would also explain why the mosque is also known by the name Jami' al-Ashraf (\\"Mosque of the Sharifs\\"). However, historians have not been able to establish a record of such a family in the area. Another possibility is that the name derives from a word like \\"muwasiyyin\\" which could denote the former presence of craftsmen along the main street of the area when the Jewish community was established there.  Architecture and layout  The floor plan (partly reconstructed) of the mosque and its annexes. The different elements include: 1) the sahn of the mosque, 2) the prayer hall, 3) the minaret, 4) the bayt al-'itikaf, 5) the library, 6) the Mouassine Fountain, 7) the mida'a (ablutions house), 8) the shops around Place Mouassine, 9) the hammam, and 10) the Qur'anic school. The mosque is the largest component in a complex of adjoining structures which also include a mida'a (ablutions house), a hammam (public bathhouse), a library, a Qur'anic reading school for children, a madrasa (no longer extant), and, more famously, a public fountain alongside a drinking trough for animals.  Evolution of mosque architecture in Saadian period  As with the near- contemporary Bab Doukkala Mosque, the Mouassine Mosque generally follows the layout and form of the 12th-century Kutubiyya Mosque which, along with other Almohad mosques of that era, more or less set the style of Moroccan mosques. This layout is often referred to as the \\"T-plan\\" model, by which the aisle or nave leading towards the mihrab and the transverse aisle running along the mihrab or qibla wall of the mosque are larger or wider than the other aisles of the hypostyle prayer hall. Like in Almohad mosques, the principal decoration was concentrated around the mihrab area and along these emphasized aisles. However, the courtyard (sahn) of the Saadian mosque was larger than in previous Almohad mosques, being nearly equal or even slightly larger than the interior prayer hall (unlike in Almohad mosques where the courtyards were proportionally much smaller). Additionally, the qibla orientation of the mosque (meant to be aligned with the direction of prayer) was shifted further east than before, closer to the \\"true\\" qibla (the direction of Mecca) and away from the predominantly southwards alignment of Almohad mosques. Both of these shifts had begun during the preceding Marinid era, but the Saadians took them further and, in the process, consolidated the form of Moroccan mosques thereafter.  The mosque  The northern entrance of the mosque. The mosque has a large, nearly square courtyard (sahn) which occupied the northern half or so of the building while the southern section is occupied by the interior prayer hall. The courtyard is centered around a fountain and is surrounded on three sides by an gallery of arches, while the prayer hall on its south side is split into seven aisles by rows of arches. The arches are almost all of Moorish or horseshoe form, while band or outlines of stucco decoration are carved around them or on the wall surfaces between them. The mosque has three main entrances: one to the north, aligned with the major central axis of the building, which opens into the courtyard, and two symmetrical side entrances to the west and east that open to the north edge of the prayer hall. The outer portal of the entrances are often highlighted with more stucco decoration, while the space just inside each entrance is covered by a copula of muqarnas (stalactite-like sculpting). The central archway on the south side of the courtyard is covered in part by a wooden screen called the anaza which covers the entrance to the aisle leading to the central mihrab (niche symbolizing the direction of prayer) and also acts as an \\"auxiliary mihrab\\" for those carrying out their prayers in the courtyard. The transverse aisle running along the qibla (southeastern) wall is demarcated from the rest of the prayer hall by another row of arches running perpendicular to the others, while the arches next to the mihrab have a \\"lambrequin\\" profile (a dented and lobed outline common in Moroccan and Moorish architecture) with muqarnas-carved intrados. The mihrab itself is an arched alcove with a small muqarnas cupola. The wall around it is covered in stucco-carved decoration featuring arabesque, geometric, and calligraphic motifs. The space between the arches in front of the mihrab is also covered above by a large square cupola of fine muqarnas. The lower part of the mihrab is also decorated by eight engaged columns in a symmetrical arrangement around the mihrab's opening. Unlike most earlier examples of this feature, which were often carved in stucco or plaster, the columns and their capitals here are made of marble. The surfaces of the columns are carved in arabesques and Arabic inscriptions, while the capitals are carved with ornate arabesques and muqarnas forms which are reminiscent of decorative Ottoman capitals of the era. = The minbar = The minbar (pulpit) of the mosque, kept next to the mihrab, follows in the artistic style and tradition of previous Almohad minbars and of the Almoravid-era Minbar of the Kutubiyya Mosque. Its form seems to be inspired in particular by the minbar of the Kasbah Mosque (a mosque which was also repaired and restored by Sultan Abdallah al-Ghalib). It is made of a combination of different-coloured woods including cedar and ebony, and its decoration mixes marquetry, ivory or bone inlay, and panels with sculpted reliefs to form both geometric and plant motifs. Scholars have argued that while the quality of its craftsmanship does not live to its predecessors, it does show originality and a continued effort to adopt new forms into the decorative schema. = The minaret = The minaret of the mosque, located at its northwestern corner, is unusual for its short height and very simple form, in contrast with the ornate minarets of most royally-sponsored mosques in Morocco. It has just one rectangular shaft (as opposed to the two-tiered design of other minarets) and rises to a height of 19.2 metres. A popular explanation reported in tradition claims that the minaret was left this way due to the demands of a vizier who lived near the mosque at the time of its construction and who objected to a tower from which someone could have potentially seen inside the courtyards and rooms of his private residence and harem. = The library and the bayt al-'itikaf = The library is attached to the mosque's southeastern corner and is accessed from a doorway in that part of the mosque. The library, whose decoration dates from a 19th-century refurbishment, consists of a large square room measuring 7.65 metres per side. The room has five large niches with bookshelves surrounded by a band of epigraphic stucco decoration. By the mid-20th century the library was abandoned and no longer housed a collection. At the southwestern corner of the mosque, extending from the southern transverse aisle of the prayer hall, is a room called the bayt al-'itikaf () which served as a space for spiritual retreat. It is a richly decorated chamber accessed from a stairway, with a richly-painted wooden ceiling and a double-arched window, decorated with carved stucco, opening back onto the mosque.  Qur'anic school and madrasa  The mosque complex originally included a separate but nearby madrasa which had 28 rooms to lodge students. It was arranged around a small courtyard and its architecture was seemingly more modest than that of the famous Saadian-era Ben Youssef Madrasa. The madrasa was later replaced by a residence for women from the Saadian aristocracy. Another school, devoted more strictly to learning the Qur'an and more akin to a primary school, was located next over the street right next to the eastern entrance of the mosque. It was referred to as a msid and also appeared to have served as a place to copy manuscripts. Still preserved today, it is located on an upper floor reached by a stairway and consists of a simple room which retains some fine stucco-carved decoration from the Saadian era. The room is partly divided by two dark marble columns with Saadian capitals carved with pine cone and palmette motifs. These in turn support consoles with arabesque and calligraphic stucco-carved decoration which support the ceiling. A frieze of more typical geometric and epigraphic decoration runs around the top of the walls of the room.  Hammam and ablutions house  The public fountain (last arch on the right) and drinking trough (three middle arches) attached to the ablutions house (mida'a) of the mosque. The hammam (bathhouse) is also accessed via the archway on the far left. To the northwest of the mosque is the mida'a () or ablutions house, which allowed for visitors to the mosque to wash their limbs and face in the performance of ritual ablutions (wudu) before prayers. It consisted of a courtyard building with an arched pavilion over a water basin in the middle. This layout is similar to that of the much older Almoravid Qubba which was itself an ablutions pavilion. To the east of this structure is the hammam or bathhouse, which allowed members of the public to fully wash themselves (an act known as ghusl). It included a changing room and then a succession of cold, warm, and hot steam rooms, mostly vaulted in brick. Much of it has been restored or redone over the years such that not much of the original Saadian materials are still visible.  Mouassine Fountain  The Mouassine Fountain, with original carved cedar wood elements from the Saadian era and later decoration added or remade in the 19th century. The Mouassine Fountain in 1920 On the north side of the ablutions house and the hammam, facing the street, is an arched structure sheltering a fountain and drinking trough. It was attached to the ablutions house in order to take advantage of the same water system. The structure occupies a rectangular space measuring about 18.1 by 4.7 metres and is divided by arches into four bays. The first three vaulted bays on the left (to the east) are occupied by what was a drinking trough for animals, while the bay on the right harboured a public fountain for humans; a wooden bar across its opening prevented pack animals from reaching it. Yet another archway stands further left and east of this whole structure but serves to give access to the hammam, while two more arches, perpendicular to the others, enclose the east side of the small public square in front of the fountain, with one of the arches giving access to the market street beyond. While the arches of the drinking trough are plain, the archway and facade of the fountain are richly decorated and bear resemblances to both the fountain of the Bab Doukkala Mosque and the Saadian-era Shrob ou Shouf Fountain. The tradition of public water fountains was already an old tradition in Morocco, as well as in the wider Islamic world where fountains, bathhouses, and sabils were common urban public amenities, in large part due to Islamic tradition placing an emphasis on the availability of water as an essential act of public charity. The Mouassine Fountain is one of the most outstanding examples in Marrakech. It was heavily renovated around 1867, under the reign of Muhammad IV, when much of its decoration was redone or added, but many of its carved cedar wood elements are preserved from the original 16th-century construction. The fountain's main arch consists of two lower corbels or consoles sculpted in plaster or stucco with muqarnas and other motifs, which in turn uphold step- like corbels made of cedar wood. Above these corbels is a cedarwood lintel and then several more horizontal bands of with painted decoration (now partly faded), culminating in a wooden canopy with muqarnas and other carved elements typical of Moroccan architecture. The cedar wood corbels and the lower wooden lintel, all richly carved, are original elements from the Saadian era (16th century), while the plaster elements and painted decoration date from the 19th century. The wooden corbels are covered with sculpted motifs of palmettes, pine cones, and leaves, while the lower lintel bears an inscription in Thuluth script, interwoven with images of leaves and plant motifs, which reads (approximate translation): \\"The most beautiful words that have been said are: praise to God in all circumstances!\\" This verse is similarly found on the lintels of the Bab Doukkala Mosque fountain and the Shrob ou Shouf Fountain. Inside the fountain, behind the arch, is another lower lintel with decoration. Its lower edge used to be painted with a inscription in black letters on a light background, but this has faded away. Above it, and extending along the side walls as well, is a frieze of stucco carved with geometric star patterns. A square plaque or tile displaying the Shahada in Square Kufic was added on the back wall of the fountain sometime after 1905.

Background The group was established in 2011 shortly after the fall of the Libyan government led by Muammar Gaddafi and established training camps in Libya as well, and formally publicized itself in September 2013 after claiming a suicide attack against the Egyptian military's intelligence headquarters in Rafah. The group later went largely in active until 2017, by threatening to fight the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and its local Sinai affiliate. The group also claims to have links to Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the group also has links to Hamas in the Gaza Strip through a Gaza-based Islamic cleric who also has ties to the Syria-based Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which is a coalition of 5 Syrian rebel groups including Jabhat Fateh al-Sham which is the successor organization to Jabhat al-Nusra that until 2016 was al-Qaeda's official branch in Syria, and has supported and maintained relations with Jund al-Islam through the Gaza cleric who acts as an intermediary between the two. al- Qaeda affiliation Though the group claims to be part of al-Qaeda and has expressed open support for it and its leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and has organizational links with its former Syrian affiliate HTS and claims to have links with its branch in Yemen, al-Qaeda has not acknowledged the group, neither recognizing it as an affiliate or support for it.https://madamasr.com/en/2017/11/14/feature/politics/clashes-between-jund- al-islam-and-province-of-sinai-the-return-of-al-qaeda/ History The group was established in February 2011 and conducted its first action as a group in May 2011 after the death of Osama bin Laden by showing off its military capabilities, and remained inactive from then until 2013. In 2013, the group claimed responsibility for a major double suicide attack against an Egyptian military intelligence compound in northern Sinai in the city of Rafah, resulting in the death of 6 and several other injuries months after the fall of Egypt's former president Mohamed Morsi in July 2013. In a statement regarding the attack Ansar Beit al-Maqdis praised the attack and claimed it was in response for Egyptian crackdowns against Islamists following the fall of Morsi and cooperation with Israel. Jund al-Islam likewise released a statement with similar rhetoric.https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2013/09/jund_al_islam_claims.php In November 2017 the group reemerged again, declaring its opposition to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Jund al-Islam claims that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and ISIL are Kharijites, and also claims that ISIL's Sinai branch has committed abuses against the local Muslim population and besieged the Gaza Strip.https://timep.org/esw/non-state- actors/jund-al-islam/ In January 2018, a Russian foreign fighter part of ISIL's Sinai province defected to Jund al-Islam after several disagreements with ISIL's leadership in Sinai, and was featured in a video released by Jund al-Islam criticizing ISIL.http://www.soutalomma.com/Article/750988/%D8%AC%D9%86%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B4%D9%82-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A1http://www.chechensinsyria.com/?p=26077 Islamic State's Wilayat Sinai claimed to have \\"exterminated\\" the remnants of Jund al-Islam in July 2020, after an encounter in which seven members of the group including their leader 'Abu Ayyub' were killed in the village of al- Burath.http://www.aymennjawad.org/2020/07/islamic-state-sinai-province-vs- jamaat-jund-al References Category:Islamist insurgent groups ","title":"Jund al-Islam"},{"id":"62564074","text":"Palash Sazzad is a Bangladeshi singer.
