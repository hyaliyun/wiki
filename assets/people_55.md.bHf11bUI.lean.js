To date, The Wake has been featured on thirty plus compilations worldwide. In addition, the band has amassed an impressive and diverse list of opening dates with bands such as NIN, Skinny Puppy, Christian Death, Innocence Mission, Alien Sex Fiend, And Also the Trees, and Shadow Project - touring extensively in the US and playing dates in Europe and Mexico. ==History== Formed in 1986 by vocalist Troy Payne and guitarist Richard Witherspoon in Columbus, Ohio USA – The Wake made its first studio recording Procession using session musicians on drums and bass in 1987. Bassist James Tramel and electronic drummer Scott Rozanski were recruited later the same year. This lineup quickly recorded first versions of tracks like: \\"Burial\\", \\"Shelia\\", and \\"Locomotive Age\\", creating a rough template for what would become The Wake's signature sound. Acoustic drummer Daniel C. replaced Rozanski early in 1989. Driven forward by Daniel's acoustic drum sound, the band moved substantially towards the rock and roll end of the sonic spectrum. Hoping to add yet another dimension to their sound, keyboardist Robert Brothers was added to the mix in 1990. In a move to gain exposure, the band started Blaylox Records. Named after the band's mascot cat, the label proved to be the perfect outlet for the band's creativity, and a vehicle for spreading the band's sound far and wide. Bolstered by the sales of their demo cassette – The Wake burst on to the NYC goth club scene with their 7” vinyl single \\"Harlot\\" in 1990. Following on the success of “Harlot”, the band released a second 7” – Sideshow on the Blaylox Records label in 1992. The combination of the popularity of these two singles, and the moxie of an influential NYC DJ, led to the band signing with Cleopatra Records in 1993. Considered by many fans of Gothic rock as a “landmark record”, The Wake's debut album “Masked” was released in October 1993. After the completion of the “Masked” tour, the band parted ways with bass player James Tramel. New bassist Steven Creighton was brought into the fold before the release of the Christine EP in 1995. The EP had a decidedly industrial/dance flavor, thanks in part to the re-mixes supplied by Rosetta Stone. The single \\"Christine\\" (mixed by The Wake and Zane Eric Brown) broke onto the top ten of Alternative Press's Dance Club charts where it remained for months. Also in ‘95, the still popular \\"Christine\\" video was filmed in and around Mexico City during the tour supporting the EP. In 1996, The Wake joined forces with former Ministry engineer \\"Fluffy\\" on their third CD – Nine Ways. The album was recorded and mixed at both Chicago Trax, and the Chicago Recording Company. Just before the release of Nine Ways, guitarist and co- founder Rich Witherspoon left the band and former MCA recording artist Mark Gamiere was enlisted to take over at guitar. Though no studio recordings were made with this lineup, Gamiere provided live tour support from 1996 to 2000. Other lineup changes include the late J.T. Murphy replacing Steven Creighton on bass in 1998. The band turned bass playing duty over to a hard-disk recorder in 1999 before giving way to a hiatus in 2000. Fast forward to 2008: The Wake surprise fans with BLACKlist – a “best of” compilation DVD with bonus unreleased material, rare tracks and video. Released on MVD/Cleopatra. Released on Blaylox Records in 2010 - The Wake's single \\"Emily Closer\\" features the reunited lineup of Payne, Witherspoon, Tramel, Brothers, and Daniel C. and was recorded and self-produced before being mastered by Howie Weinberg at Masterdisk. December 2013, The Wake announce the imminent release of a new single - \\"Rusted\\" and remix by legendary musician/producer John Fryer. Released on Blaylox Records, the single features the lineup of Troy Payne, Rich Witherspoon, and Daniel C.. ==DiscographyReleases=== *“the Wake” (’90) Cassette Blay691 (Blaylox Records) USA *“Harlot” B/W “Suicide” (’90) 7” Red & Black Vinyl Limited 1000 Blay69 ( Records) USA *“On the Ghost Train” (’91) Live Video Blay692gtv ( Records) USA *“The Wake” (’92) 4 Song Digital Re-Master “Limited Nms” Cassette Blay0696 ( Records) USA *“Sideshow” B/W “audrey” (’92) 7” Purple & Black Vinyl Limited 1000 Blay0698 ( Records) USA *“Masked” (’93) CD & Cassette Cleo 09187-2 (Cleopatra Records) USA *“Christine Ep” (’95) CD Cleo 09640-2 (Cleopatra Records) USA *“Nine Ways” (’96) CD Cleo 09708-2 (Cleopatra Records) USA *“Blacklist” (’08) Dvd (mvd/cleopatra Records) USA *\\"Emily Closer\\" ('10) DD Blay 859703130695 (Blaylox Records) USA *\\"Rusted\\" ('14) DD Blay 859711730504 (Blaylox Records) USA *\\"Rusted (John Fryer Remix)\\" ('14) DD Blay 859711731136 (Blaylox Records) USA ===Compilation appearances=== * “Burial” (’89) Sprogg Magazine Compilation Cass USA *“Nazarene” (’91) Aesthetics Magazine Live Video USA *\\"Nazarene\\" ('91) Various - Gotham Cass USA *“Harlot” (’92) Screams Of Torture Cass Nct93-107 Germany *“Locomotive Age” (’93) Cold Tears/Darkland Of Tears Cass France *“Audrey” (’93) L’appel De La Muse, Vol Iii CD Aje-08 France *“Harlot” (’93) The Whip Freud CD 043 (Jungle Records) Uk *“Silent Siren” (’94) The Fallen Angel CD Msrp002 (zoth Ommog) Germany *“Nazarene” (’94) Mysterious Encounters CD Cleo 06808-2 USA *“Locomotive Age” (’94) In Goth Daze CD Cleo 09400-2 USA *“Locomotive Age” (‘94) New Alternatives 2 CD (Nightbreed Records) Uk *“Sideshow” (’95) Gothik CD Cleo 09536-2 USA *“Watchtower” (’95) Stars, Hide Your Fires CD (Hyperium) Germany *“Christine” (’95) Gothic Rock 2 CD Cleo 09648-2 USA *“Christine” (’96) Wired Injection CD Cleo 09675-2 USA *“Control” (’96) Goth Box CD Cleo 09798-2 USA *“Christine” (’96) Goth Box Video (tHE Visual Companion) Dvd Cleo 9800 USA *“Watchtower 2.1 Mix” (‘97) Goth’s Undead CD Cleo 00038 USA *“Christine” (’97) Goth's Paradise The Black Book Compilation Vol.1 CD (orkus) Germany *“Procession” (’97) Songs to Wake the Dead CD (cleo\\\\blackrat) USA *“Lightning” (’98) German Mystic Sound Sampler Vol. Vii Zillo CD Germany *“Christine” (’98) Undercurrents ’98 CD USA *“Nazarene” (’98) Gothspotting CD Cleo 00224-2 USA *“Suicide” (’98) The Black Bible CD Cleo 00387 USA *“Christine” (‘00) Remix Collection-Gothic Industrial CD Cleo 00914-2 USA *“Nazarene” (’00) This Is Goth CD Cleo USA *\\"Christine\\" ('00) Dark Noise 2000 CD Cleo USA *“Christine” (’03) Dancing On Your Grave CD Cleo USA *“Nazarene” (‘04) Gothika CD Cleo 001334-2 USA *\\"Watchtower\\" ('04) Various - Strobelights Vol 1 CD Strob 006 (Strobelight Records) Austria *“Christine” (‘05) Goth Industrial Club Anthems CD Cleo 1466 USA *“Nazarene” (‘06) This Is Gothic – The Bat Cave Anthology CD Cleo 01606-2 USA *“Sideshow” (‘06) Gothik – Special Anniversary Edition CD Cleo 01610-2 USA *“SIDESHOW” (’06) The Goth Anthology: Underground Anthems From Rock’s Dark Side CD Metro Music Uk *\\"Suicide\\" ('07) Various - Gothic Compilation Part Xxxvi CD Bat 038 (Batbeliever Releases) Germany *“Christine” (‘08) Goth As F__K Special Limited Edition 12” Vinyl Cleo 02093-1 USA *\\"Sheet Metal Eyes\\" ('11) Various - Another Gift From Goth - 90'S Gothic Rock Compilation CD Strob 036 (Strobelight Records) Austria ==External links== *The Wake (the official site) *The Wake (official Reverbnation page) *The Wake (official myspace page) *The Wake (2) *The Wake (2) *The Unofficial THE WAKE Discography Category:American gothic rock groups Category:Alternative rock groups from Ohio Category:Musical groups from Columbus, Ohio ","title":"The Wake (US band)"},{"id":"6235826","text":"C.

He grew up in Oberlin, Ohio. His mother was a singer in the 1960s. Williams began playing the drums, self-taught, at the age of seven and played professionally from his mid-teens. From 1968, \\"he studied arranging and composition at the Berklee School of Music\\". ==Later life and career== Williams played for a short time with various musicians in New York in 1971, joined pianist Marc Copland's band, and played for the first time with saxophonist Lee Konitz in 1972. He continued to work with Konitz on and off into the 2000s. Williams played with saxophonist Stan Getz at the end of 1972 and into early 1973, before joining the band Lookout Farm, led by Dave Liebman and Richie Beirach. Williams was also the drummer in pianist Beirach's trio for recordings in the mid-1970s. Williams was part of the band Interplay, formed by bassist Anthony Cox and pianist Peter Madsen in the mid-1980s. This trio went on to play with Getz in 1987. Some of Williams's compositions were played on the albums Coalescence and Jazzblues. The former title was also the name of Williams's group from 1991 to 1996. The following year, \\"he formed the trio Circadian Rhythms with Tony Malaby and Michael Formanek. He also formed another trio, Left-handed Compliment, with the alto saxophonist John O'Gallagher and Madsen (on Hammond organ)\\". Williams has taught at the Royal Academy of Music and the Birmingham Conservatoire. He is married to the American author Lionel Shriver. ==DiscographyAs leader or co-leader=== * Another Time (Whirlwind, 2011) * The Listener (Whirlwind, 2013) * Outlier (Whirlwind, 2016) * Lifelike (Whirlwind, 2018) * Bloom (Whirlwind, 2019) ===As sideman=== With Richard Beirach * Eon (ECM, 1974) * Methuselah (Trio, 1975) With Paul Bley * Paul Plays Carla (SteepleChase, 1992) With Ethan Iverson * Live at Smalls (Fresh Sound, 2000) With Lee Konitz * Lunasea (Soul Note, 1992) with Peggy Stern * Dig-It (SteepleChase, 1999) with Ted Brown * First Meeting: Live in London, Volume 1 (Whirlwind, 2014) With Dave Liebman * Lookout Farm (ECM, 1973) * Drum Ode (ECM, 1974) * Sweet Hands (Horizon, 1975) ==References *Official site * Cheltenham Jazz Festival 2009 Retrieved 8 January 2011 * Retrieved 8 January 2011 Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Jazz musicians from Ohio Category:Academics of the Royal Academy of Music Category:American expatriates in the United Kingdom Category:American jazz drummers ","title":"Jeff Williams (musician)"},{"id":"6235902","text":"For other uses of Compartmentalization, see Compartmentalization. Compartmentalization, in information security, whether public or private, is the limiting of access to information to persons or other entities on a need- to-know basis to perform certain tasks. It originated in the handling of classified information in military and intelligence applications. It dates back to antiquity, and was successfully used to keep the secret of Greek fire. The basis for compartmentalization is the idea that, if fewer people know the details of a mission or task, the risk or likelihood that such information will be compromised or fall into the hands of the opposition is decreased. Hence, varying levels of clearance within organizations exist. Yet, even if someone has the highest clearance, certain \\"compartmentalized\\" information, identified by codewords referring to particular types of secret information, may still be restricted to certain operators, even with a lower overall security clearance. Information marked this way is said to be codeword–classified. One famous example of this was the Ultra secret, where documents were marked \\"Top Secret Ultra\\": \\"Top Secret\\" marked its security level, and the \\"Ultra\\" keyword further restricted its readership to only those cleared to read \\"Ultra\\" documents. Compartmentalization is now also used in commercial security engineering as a technique to protect information such as medical records. ==Example== An example of compartmentalization was the Manhattan Project. Personnel at Oak Ridge constructed and operated centrifuges to isolate uranium-235 from naturally occurring uranium, but most did not know exactly what they were doing. Those that knew did not know why they were doing it. Parts of the weapon were separately designed by teams who did not know how the parts interacted. ==See also== * Information sensitivity * Principle of least privilege * Read into * Sensitive Compartmented Information ==References== * Category:Data security Category:National security Category:Classified information Category:Intelligence assessment ","title":"Compartmentalization (information security)"},{"id":"6235924","text":"For other uses of Compartmentalization, see Compartmentalization.

Compartmentalization allows these conflicting ideas to co-exist by inhibiting direct or explicit acknowledgement and interaction between separate compartmentalized self-states. ==Psychoanalytic views== Psychoanalysis considers that whereas isolation separates thoughts from feeling, compartmentalization separates different (incompatible) cognitions from each other.Nancy McWilliams, Psychoanalytic Diagnosis (2011) p. 135-6 As a secondary, intellectual defense, it may be linked to rationalization.McWilliams, p. 200 and p. 136 It is also related to the phenomenon of neurotic typing, whereby everything must be classified into mutually exclusive and watertight categories.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (1946) p. 286 Otto Kernberg has used the term \\"bridging interventions\\" for the therapist's attempts to straddle and contain contradictory and compartmentalized components of the patient's mind.Salman Akhtar, Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis (2009) p. 42 ==Vulnerability== Compartmentalization may lead to hidden vulnerabilities in those who use it as a major defense mechanism.J. W. Reich et al, Handbook of Adult Resilience (2012) p. 192 Those suffering from borderline personality disorder will often divide people into all good versus all bad, to avoid the conflicts removing the compartments would inevitably bring, using denial or indifference to protect against any indications of contradictory evidence. Using indifference towards a better viewpoint is a normal and common example of this. It can be caused by someone having used multiple compartment ideals and having been uncomfortable with modifying them, at risk of being found incorrect. This often causes double-standards, and bias. ==Social identity== Conflicting social identities may be dealt with by compartmentalizing them and dealing with each only in a context-dependent way.R. J. Crisp, The Psychology of Social and Cultural Diversity (2011) p. 16 and p. 39 ==Literary examples== In his novel, The Human Factor, Graham Greene has one of his corrupt officials use the rectangular boxes of Ben Nicholson's art as a guide to avoiding moral responsibility for bureaucratic decision-making—a way to compartmentalize oneself within one's own separately colored box.G Greene, The Human Factor (Penguin 1978) p. 38 Doris Lessing considered that the essential theme of The Golden Notebook was \\"that we must not divide things off, must not compartmentalise.

A patent for an automobile \\"headrest\\" was granted to Benjamin Katz, a resident of Oakland, California, in 1921.US Patent 1471168: Headrest for Automobile Seats and the Like Additional patents for such devices were issued in 1930US Patent 1781600: Combined Automobile Headrest and Strap Hanger and in 1950,US Patent 2502801: Headrest for Automobile Seats and subsequently. The major U. K. supplier of head restraints, Karobes, filed patents in the late 1950s and was still competitive in 1973 when British tests evaluated the quality of these devices.New Scientist: Head rests take a bashing, July 5, 1973. Optional head restraints began appearing on North American cars in the late 1960s, and were mandated by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in all new cars sold in the U.S. after 1 January 1969. The U.S. regulation, called Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 202, requires that head restraints meet one of the following two standards of performance, design, and construction: *During a forward acceleration of at least 8g on the seat supporting structure, the rearward angular displacement of the head reference line shall be limited to 45° from the torso reference line, or *Head restraints must be at least above the seating reference point in their highest position and not deflect more than under a moment. The lateral width of the head restraint, measured at a point either below the top of the head restraint or above the seating reference point must be not less than for use with bench seats and for use with individual seats. The head restraint must withstand an increasing rearward load until there is a failure of the seat or seat back, or until a load of is applied. An evaluation performed by NHTSA in 1982 on passenger cars found that \\"integral\\" head restraints—a seat back extending high enough to meet the height requirement—reduces injury by 17 percent, while adjustable head restraints, attached to the seat back by one or more sliding metal shafts, reduce injury by 10 percent. NHTSA has said this difference may be due to adjustable restraints being improperly positioned. == Whiplash protection == The focus of preventive measures to date has been on the design of car seats, primarily through the introduction of head restraints, often called headrests. This approach is potentially problematic given the underlying assumption that purely mechanical factors cause whiplash injuries — an unproven theory. So far the injury reducing effects of head restraints appears to have been low, approximately 5–10%, because car seats have become stiffer in order to increase crashworthiness of cars in high-speed rear-end collisions which in turn could increase the risk of whiplash injury in low- speed rear impact collisions. Improvements in the geometry of car seats through better design and energy absorption could offer additional benefits. Active devices move the body in a crash in order to shift the loads on the car seat. For the last 40 years, vehicle safety researchers have been designing and gathering information on the ability of head restraints to mitigate injuries resulting from rear-end collisions. As a result, different types of head restraints have been developed by various manufacturers to protect their occupants from whiplash. Below are definitions of different types of head restraints. Head restraint — refers to a device designed to limit the rearward displacement of an adult occupant's head in relation to the torso in order to reduce the risk of injury to the cervical vertebrae in the event of a rear impact. The most effective head restraint must allow a backset motion of less than 60 mm to prevent the hyperextension of the neck during impact. Integrated head restraint or fixed head restraint — refers to a head restraint formed by the upper part of the seat back, or a head restraint that is not height adjustable and cannot be detached from the seat or the vehicle structure except by the use of tools or following the partial or total removal of the seat furnishing”. Adjustable head restraint — refers to a head restraint that is capable of being positioned to fit the morphology of the seated occupant. The device may permit horizontal displacement, known as tilt adjustment, and/or vertical displacement, known as height adjustment. Active head restraint — refers to a device designed to automatically improve head restraint position and/or geometry during an impact. Saab Active Head Restraint Automatically adjusting head restraint — refers to a head restraint that automatically adjusts the position of the head restraint when the seat position is adjusted. A major issue in whiplash prevention is the lack of proper adjustment of the seat safety system by both drivers and passengers. Studies have shown that a well designed and adjusted head restraint could prevent potentially injurious head-neck kinematics in rear-end collisions by limiting the differential movement of the head and torso. The primary function of a head restraint is to minimize the relative rearward movement of the head and neck during rear impact. During a rear-end collision, the presence of an effective head restraint behind the occupant's head can limit the differential movement of the head and torso. A properly placed head restraint where one can sufficiently protect one's head lower the chances of neck injury by up to 43% during a rear-end collision. In contrast to a properly adjusted head restraint, research suggests that there may be an increased risk of neck injuries if the head restraint is incorrectly positioned. More studies by manufacturers and automobile safety organizations are currently undergoing to examine the best ways to reduce head and torso injuries during a rear-end impact with different geometries of the head restraint and seat-back systems. In most passenger vehicles where manually adjustable head restraints are fitted, proper use requires sufficient knowledge and awareness by occupants. When driving, the height of the head restraint is critical in influencing injury risk. A restraint should be at least as high as the head's center of gravity, or about 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) below the top of the head. The backset, or distance behind the head, should be as small as possible. Backsets of more than 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) have been associated with increased symptoms of neck injury in crashes. Due to low public awareness of the consequence of incorrect positioning of head restraints, some passenger vehicle manufactures have designed and implemented a range of devices into their models to protect their occupants. Some current systems are: * Mercedes- Benz A-Class Active Head Restraint (AHR)Long Fibre-Reinforced Polyamide for Crash-Active Car Headrests, August 22, 2006, NECK-PRO * Saab (Responsible for the first active head restraint), Opel, Ford, Nissan, Subaru, Hyundai, and Peugeot — Active Head restraint (SAHR)Top Safety Ratings For Saab Active Head Restraints, UK Motor Search Engine, August 22, 2006, * Volvo and Jaguar — Whiplash Protection System/Whiplash Prevention System (WHIPS)Volvo Seat Is Benchmark For Whiplash Protection, Volvo Owners Club, August 22, 2006, and * Toyota — Whiplash Injury Lessening (WIL). The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and other testing centers around the world have been involved in testing the effectiveness of head restraint and seat systems in laboratory conditions to assess their ability to prevent or mitigate whiplash injuries. They have found that over 60% of new motor vehicles on the market have “good” rated head restraints. == See also == *HANS device == References == Category:Vehicle safety technologies Category:Automotive accessories ","title":"Head restraint"},{"id":"6235969","text":"Walter Frederick OsborneHe appears as \\"Frederick\\" in records until around 1884 (17 June 1859 - 24 April 1903) was an Irish impressionist and Post- Impressionism landscape and portrait painter, best known for his documentary depictions of late 19th century working class life. Most of his paintings are figurative and focus on women, children, the elderly, the poor, and the day- to-day life of ordinary people on Dublin streets, as well as series of rural scenes. He also produced city-scapes, which he painted from both sketches and photographs. A prolific artist, he produced oils, watercolours, and numerous pencil sketches. Osborne's talent was evident as a young man and he traveled widely in his youth; studying at the Academie Royale des Beaux Arts in Antwerp. He became a member of the Royal Hibernian Academy after an early showing. Later, he spent time in rural England and Brittany, where he became acquainted with the style of the impressionists. Osborne produced works in oil, water-colour, pastel and pencil. His main source of income was portraiture, landscapes and depictions of animals, but he is today better known for his documentary depictions of Ireland's working class poor. Osborne had an engaging, charismatic personality and was well thought of in a variety of social circles.\\"Osbourne, Walter Frederick, R.H.A.\\". Library Ireland. Retrieved 15 May 2016 He died from pneumonia at 43 years, before achieving his full potential. Today he is regarded as a major Irish artist. ==LifeEarly life=== Dublin Streets: a Vendor of Books, 1889. From a series of studies of Dublin working-class people, which emphasised the plight and hardships of the city's poor Walter Osborne was born in Rathmines, Dublin, the second of three sons of William Osborne, a successful animal painter who specialised in portraying horses and dogs for the then prosperous Irish landlords.Campbell, Julian. \\"Walter Frederick Osborne, R.H.A. (1859-1903)\\". Christie's, 14 May 2004. Retrieved 20 May 2017 By the 1880s, many landlords had hit economic difficulties, and William had to focus on painting mostly dogs.Gwynn (1943), 463-64 Walter learned from his father that there was money to be earned from painting animals, and he produced quite a few; including of children with their pets, notably his 1885 A New Arrival, and a series of impressionistic works on cows. Yet, according to art historian Campbell, in these paintings, \\"Osborne eschews the overly sentimental or literary quality of much Victorian genre painting, and displays a more down-to-earth, realistic approach, and a mood of gentleness.\\" He was educated at Rathmines School and at the Royal Hibernian Academy school.Boylan ===Success=== In a Dublin Park, Light and Shade, 1895 He won the Taylor Prize in 1881 and 1882,\\"Walter Frederick Osborne (1859-1903)\\".

Retrieved 20 May 2017 In 1883, Osborne moved from Antwerp to Brittany where he painted his famous Apple Gathering, Quimperlé, now in the National Gallery of Ireland. Soon after, he moved to England where he worked alongside Nathaniel Hill and Augustus Burke at Walberswick. During his period he often returned to Dublin to make preparatory sketches for what became his most renowned series, of the everyday lives of the city's poor. Although highly regarded today, these documentary, street paintings were not commercially successful, and Osborne supplemented his income through portrait paintings of the middle class, which were not as artistically satisfying. In 1886, he was elected to the Royal Hibernian Academy and received many commissions for portraits.Boylan This was an important source of income, as he had no private means of his own. After his sister died he was involved in looking after her daughter, and his own parents became increasingly financially dependent on him. In 1892, he returned to Ireland to live in the family residence, and he also kept a studio at No. 7 St. Stephen's Green. He spent a considerable amount of time painting outdoors, in Dublin around St. Patrick's Cathedral or in the country. He was well liked in social circles and counted the surgeon Sir Thornely Stoker, brother of Bram Stoker, among his best friends. ===Death=== Photograph of Walter Osborne His mother became ill in the early 1900s, and Walter spend significant periods caring for her. In 1903, while gardening, he overheated himself and caught a chill, which he neglected, and which developed into pneumonia.Gwynn (1943), 466 He died prematurely from the illness on April 24, 1903 at the age of 43. He is buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery.Boylan Some critics have suggested that at the time of his death he was on the brink of his artistic maturity. His final work Tea in the Garden, a fusion of naturalism and impressionism, remained unfinished at his death and is now in the collection of the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery in Dublin. Today his work is highly sought after by collectors.Top 10 Best Selling Irish Artists Writing in 1943, and lamenting Osborne's early death, Stephen Gwynn wrote that he \\"never knew a man who seemed more likely than Walter Osborne to live to a happy and vigorous old age\\".Gwynn (1943), 463 His final work was \\"Tea in the Garden, described as \\"a beautiful combination of naturalism and impressionism remained unfinished at his death\\". ==Gallery== File:Walter Osborne A Grey Morning in a Breton Farmyard.jpgA Grey Morning in a Breton Farmyard, before 1884 File:Walter Osborne Milking Time.jpgMilking Time File:Walter Osborne Galway Market Scene.jpgGalway Market Scene File:Walter Osborne The Card Builders.jpgThe Card Builders File:Walter Osborne A New Arrival.jpgA New Arrival, 1885 File:'A Backstreet in the Snow' by Walter Osborne.jpgA Backstreet in the Snow, 1895 File:Walter Osborne ortrait of Mrs Chadwyck-Healy and her Daughter.jpgPortrait of Mrs Chadwyck-Healy and her Daughter, 1901 File:Walter Osborne Summertime.jpgSummertime, 1901 ==ReferencesNotes=Sources=== *Boylan, Henry.

On 7 May 2003 he was named as the club's \\"Young Player of the Year\\". In July 2003 he signed a two-year extension to his contract, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2005–06 season. He went on to make 132 appearances in total for The Millers. In the 2005–06 season he topped the club's appearance list with 42 league games and one as a substitute. On 7 February 2006 he was named in the Football League's \\"Team of the Week\\" for League One following his performance in a match against Hartlepool United on 4 February. ===Blackpool=== Barker joined Blackpool on 2 August 2006 on a free transfer, after turning down two offers of a new contract from Rotherham. He signed a two-year contract with an option for a further year. Although he was signed originally as a centre-half, he was used as a right-back. His first goal for Blackpool was a last-minute winner against Dario Gradi's Crewe Alexandra on 21 October 2006, ten minutes after The Seasiders had been reduced to ten men through Simon Gillett's dismissal. He captained the side for the first time on 6 March 2007, in a 2–0 home win against Bournemouth. Barker was one of two ever-present players during Blackpool's 2007–08 league season, the other being Paul Rachubka. He was also the vice captain for the season. For the 2008–09 season, Rob Edwards was named as the \\"on-field\\" captain, with Barker as vice-captain and club captain. On 1 September 2008, Barker was named in the Press Association's Championship \\"Team of the Week\\" following his performance in the club's match at Southampton on 30 August. On 18 October 2008 he made his 100th league appearance for The Seasiders, in their 0–0 draw against Doncaster Rovers at the Keepmoat Stadium. In the second half of the 2008–09 season, when Tony Parkes took over as caretaker manager, \\"Reggie\\", as he is known by Blackpool supporters, was moved to his usual centre-back role and cemented his place in that position. His performances led to his being linked with a move to Derby County, which Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston angrily dismissed, saying that \\"we've not had an offer from Derby... so unless anything changes drastically between now and August then he [Barker] will be starting here next season\\". It was later revealed that Derby had submitted a formal bid for Barker, believed to be in the region of £400,000, which was rejected. ===Derby County=== Barker joined Derby County on 15 July 2009, for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around £900,000, signing a three-year contract. Barker made his Derby début as an 89th-minute substitute in a 3–2 defeat to Scunthorpe United on 15 August, his start to the season being delayed by a slight hamstring strain. He made his first start for Derby in a 1–0 defeat to Sheffield United on 12 September, going on to make thirteen consecutive appearances and scoring his first goal for the club in a 3–2 defeat to Barnsley on 15 September. However, having been playing through a thigh injury, a scan after Derby's 2–1 win over Reading on 28 November revealed that the tear in his thigh muscle had gotten worse, ruling him out for several weeks. Barker made his return from injury with a substitute appearance in Derby's FA Cup win over Millwall on 12 January 2010 and started the next game, a 3–0 win over Peterborough on 16 January. From this point Barker shrugged off the injury problems that had curtailed the earlier part of his season and finished the season with a run of 23 consecutive appearances, scoring twice (the third in a 3–0 win over Newcastle United and the equaliser in a 1–1 draw away to Q.P.R.) to take his tally for the season to five. Barker enjoyed a successful first season with Derby and, although the side struggled in the league, only achieving safety in the 44th fixture, he was awarded The Jack Stamps Trophy before the final game of the season against Cardiff City, his second successive Player of the Year award after winning Blackpool's 2008/09 award. Whilst Derby finished midtable in 2009/10, Barker's former club Blackpool earned promotion to the Premier League leading some observers to suggest he might regret the decision to move to a supposed bigger club. Of this Barker said, :\\"I'd make the same choice. It's funny how things work out. Obviously I made the move with a long-term view to getting in the Premier League. I looked at the reality, everything was right. A bigger club, more money – and I don't care what some say, that's a big thing. I had an offer to improve my life, move back to my family and do the right thing for my two-year-old daughter. People go on about how much footballers earn but it's a short career and outside the top level you need to be careful and do right for your family. I was looking at one day playing in the Premier League and everything at Derby seemed right. \\"I was delighted for (Blackpool) but there is bound to be that little thought of 'What if?' What Ian Holloway has done there is beyond comprehension.\\" Barker was named Derby's Vice Captain ahead of the 2010/11 campaign and started the season as first choice centrehalf alongside Dean Leacock. His first goal of the season came in the ninth match, as he netted a crucial equaliser against Middlesbrough in first half stoppage time that spurred The Rams onto a 3–1 win. On 14 December 2010, it was also announced he had signed a new 3 deal with the club, taking him through until July 2014. Although Derby once again struggled, Barker featured in every game bar one – which he missed due to suspension – throughout the campaign up until safety was assured on Easter Monday 2011. With safety assured, he had surgery on a knee problem which had been an issue throughout most of his two years at Derby and had prevented him from training for the majority of the end of the 2010–11 season. As a result, Barker missed the first 16 games of the following season, returning to action in a reserve fixture against Sheffield United on 15 November 2011. He made his first team return as a late substitute in a 2–0 defeat against Hull City on 19 November 2011, making his first start in a 3–1 defeat at West Ham United on 26 November. Barker retained his place in the side where he partnered Jason Shackell in central defence, starting 21 games together, with Derby winning 8, drawing 4, losing 9 games and conceding 23 goals. On 13 March, in a game against Nottingham Forest Barker was involved in a collision and after a 6-minute break in the game was substituted and rushed off to hospital with a suspected broken leg.https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/17268017 A day after the game, Barker was ruled out for the remainder of the season with a dislocated kneecap. However, on 22 March 2012 after further scans in hospital, Barker was facing a 16-month recovery from his injury, (ruling him out of the entire 2012–13 season) after rupturing his medial, anterior cruciate and posterior cruciate ligaments. Barker also had a 3 hour operation to remove damage to the patellar ligament, Barker will also wear a brace to the first 8 weeks to help protect the dislocated knee. Barker remains optimistic for a full recovery. Surgeon Dr Andrew Williams said in April 2012 that he was happy with the progress Barker had made in his injury recovery after his first check-up, with Barker expected to be in a leg brace and crutches for at least 12 weeks. Barker has also spent 6 hours a day in a Kneehab XP, which Barker calls a \\"machine of death\\" the machine helps rebuild quadriceps muscles through set spells of contraction and relaxation. Barker has also spent time in an ice machine. Because he would miss the 2012–13 season due to his injury, Barker was not given a squad number, with Nigel Clough allocating his no.5 shirt to Jake Buxton. Despite this, Clough stated that Barker will play an \\"important part\\" in the season as club captain despite being on the sidelines all season. Clough said; \\"Shaun is going to be as important as ever; he is a great leader. He will be around the place and it will be a case of us supporting him, then him supporting us as well. We will help get Shaun through the next 12 months or so, but we feel as though he can be a major positive on the first team squad. He won't be moping around, he won't be sulking, he will be his usual positive self around the place and he is good to have around.\\" Clough also said he saw similarities between Barker and club capatin Richard Keogh, who joined the club as a replacement for the sold Jason Shackell. Despite this injury, Barker signed a one-year extension to his contract in September 2012, which extended his stay at the club until the summer of 2015. In February 2013. eleven months after his injury, it was reported that Barker had undergone three further operations and his rehab was stepped up by taking part in swimming sessions, Barker stated his relief at being able to exercise and step his recovery outside of Derby's training facility at Moor Farm and was again hopeful for a return to the Derby County team. Barker was unable to return to fitness from pre-season ahead of the 2013–14 season, with an exact timeframe of a return unsure. Barker didn't make any appearances for Derby during the season, as he continued his rehabilitation work throughout the season, notably in Düsseldorf, Germany and Philadelphia, America.Working With Specialist Rehab Coach Bill Knowles in Philadelphia The 2014–15 season, however, began on a far more promising note for Barker. On 14 August 2014, he was able to return to light training with the Derby Under 21 side. On this experience he commented: \\"I did a full hour session which involved a long warm up, two different 'keep ball' games and finished with a small 8 vs 8 game. To complete that was indescribable. I've had two years and four months of football stolen from my life and finally I got to enjoy 60 minutes of the game I love so much.\\" My Third Blog In early March 2015, it was reported that Barker was undergoing a trial with former manager Nigel Clough at Sheffield United, having been out of the game for almost three years.

It ran from 1933 and ran uninterrupted until 1973. In season 1975/76 it was revived and played for by sides who did not reach the League of Ireland Cup quarter finals. In 1983/84 it was revived again but only 8 teams were invited to play, the 6 Dublin sides (Bohemians, Shamrock Rovers, Shelbourne, St Patrick's Athletic, UCD and Home Farm) along with Drogheda United and Dundalk. It was played in a variety of formats; from complete round robin series to straight knock out tournaments. From the 1951/52 season it was played as a knockout tournament. It was traditionally seen as the fourth most important competition for League of Ireland sides (after the League, FAI Cup and League of Ireland Shield or League Cup).

He made around sixty films, including feature films, documentaries and TV serials. He is considered to be the pioneer of the National Cinema movement and the initiator of the production of TV serials in Turkey. ==Biography== Halit Refiğ graduated from Şişli Terakki High School in 1951 and studied engineering at Robert College in Istanbul. Refiğ directed his first films in 8mm while he served as a military reserve officer in Korea, Japan and Ceylon. He wrote articles on cinema at newspapers in 1956 and published the Sinema Dergisi magazine together with Nijat Özön. He began his career as Atıf Yılmaz's assistant in 1957 together with Yılmaz Güney. He worked as scriptwriter for Atıf Yılmaz and Memduh Ün. His directorial debut was Forbidden Love (Yasak Aşk) (1961). His 1962 film Stranger in the City was entered into the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival. In the 1970s, with the decline in Turkish cinema, he started to work extensively for TV. In 1974, he contributed as an instructor to the first cinema education programs initiated by the Istanbul State Fine Arts Academy (the Mimar Sinan University of Fine Arts of today) where he started to work as lecturer in 1975. In 1975, he directed the TV series Aşk-ı Memnu (Forbidden Love) which was aired on the Turkish Radio Television, TRT. This TV serial is considered to be the first miniseries on Turkish television stations. In 1978, he wrote a script for a documentary about the life of Mimar Sinan on commission from the Mimar Sinan University. The project was not completed but the script was published. In 1999, on commission from the then Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit, he began developing a feature film project titled Devlet Ana (Mother State), to be released on the 700th anniversary of the establishment of the Ottoman Empire. The project was going to be conducted in collaboration with the Mimar Sinan University (MSU). In 2001, Refiğ stated that he will not collaborate with MSU and thus the project was not realized. ==Censorship== Refiğ's 1979-81 adaptation of Kemal Tahir's novel, Yorgun Savaşçı, for TRT, where he served as an advisor, was banned from broadcast by TRT on accounts of incorporating scenes which were anti-Atatürk, anti-Turkish Independence War, and pro-Çerkes Ethem. A commission of seven people comprising three colonels, a representative of the Ministry of Interior, a representative of the press office of the Prime Minister, two TRT representatives, and Turgut Özakman, the director of the Turkish State Theatres, representing the Ministry of Culture, was formed on order from President Kenan Evren and Prime Minister Bülent Ulusu and the prints were burnt in 1983 by TRT director Macit Akman, at the furnaces of the Turkish General Staff printhouse under the supervision of the said commission. This censorship caused public controversy. A surviving copy surfaced in 1993 and the 8-episode miniseries was broadcast in its entirety on TRT. ==Academic life== He lectured at the University of Wisconsin in 1976, where he directed The Intercessors, and at Denison University in Ohio in 1984, where he shot In the Wilderness with his students. He was given the title of \\"Honorary Professor\\" by Marmara University in 1997. ==Death== He suffered from cholangiocarcinoma and died on 11 October 2009 in Istanbul, aged 75. He was interred in the Zincirlikuyu Cemetery two days later, following the funeral service held at Teşvikiye Mosque. ==Filmography as director== * Seviştiğimiz Günler (1961) * Yasak Aşk (1961) * Şehirdeki Yabancı (1962) * Gençlik Hülyaları (1962) * Şafak Bekçileri (1963) * Gurbet Kuşları (1964) * Şehrazat (1964) * Evcilik Oyunu (1964) * İstanbul'un Kızları (1964) * Canım Sana Feda (1965) * Güneşe Giden Yol (1965) * Haremde Dört Kadın (1965) * Kırık Hayatlar (1965) * Erkek Ve Dişi (1966) * Üç Korkusuz Arkadaş (1966) * Karakolda Ayna Var (1966) * Can Yoldaşları (1966) * Kız Kolunda Damga Var (1967) * Bir Türk'e Gönül Verdim (1969) * Yaşamak Ne Güzel Şey (1969) * Adsız Cengaver (1970) * Sevmek Ve Ölmek Zamanı (1971) * Ali Cengiz Oyunu (1971) * Çöl Kartalı (1972) * Acı Zafer (1972) * Aşk Fırtınası (1972) * Fatma Bacı (1972) * Kızın Varmı Derdin Var (1973) * Cennetin Kapısı (1973) * Sultan Gelin (1973) * Vurun Kahpeye (1973) * Yedi Evlat İki Damat (1973) * Aşk-ı Memnu (1975) (TV) * Arabulucular (1977) * Yaşam Kavgası (1978) * Yorgun Savaşçı (1979) (TV) * Leyla İle Mecnun (1982) * O Kadın (1982) * Beyaz Ölüm (1983) * İhtiras Fırtınası (1983) * Alev Alev (1984) * Ölüm Yolu (1985) * Paramparça (1985) * Son Darbe (1985) * Kıskıvrak (1986) * Teyzem (1986) * Yarın Ağlayacağım (1986) * Kızımın Kanı (1987) * Kurtar Beni (1987) * Kızım Ve Ben (1988) * Hanım (1988) * Karılar Koğuşu (1989) * İki Yabancı (1990) * Zirvedekiler (1993) (TV) * Köpekler Adası (1996) * Affet Bizi Hocam (1998) (TV) * Kerem (1999) * Affet Beni Hocam (2000) * Zeynep Öğretmen (2000) (TV) * Gelinlik Kız (2000) * Sara ile Musa (2000) (TV) * Midasın Düşü (2000) (TV) * Gençlik (2000) ==Producer== * Yaşamak Hakkımdır 1958 * İstanbul'un Kızları 1964 * Canım Sana Feda 1965 * İki Yabancı 1990 ==Screenwriter== { style=\\"font-size: 100%\\"  valign=\\"top\\" * Yaşamak Hakkımdır 1958 * Ala Geyik 1959 * Karacaoğlan'ın Kara Sevdası 1959 * Suçlu 1960 * Mahallenin Sevgilisi 1960 * Ölüm Peşimizde 1960 * Kırık Çanaklar 1960 * Avare Mustafa 1961 * Seviştiğimiz Günler 1961 * Yasak Aşk 1961 * Güneş Doğmasın 1961 * Şafak Bekçileri 1963 * Yavaş Gel Güzelim 1963 * İstanbul'un Kızları 1964 * Şehrazat 1964 * Gurbet Kuşları 1964 * Güneşe Giden Yol 1965 * Kırık Hayatlar 1965 * Haremde Dört Kadın 1965 * Yasak Sokaklar 1965 * Karakolda Ayna Var 1966 * Aslan Pençesi 1966 * Can Yoldaşları 1966 * Üç Korkusuz Arkadaş 1966 * Erkek Ve Dişi 1966  valign=\\"top\\" * Kanlı Hayat 1967 * Kız Kolunda Damga Var 1967 * Aslan Yürekli Kabadayı 1967 * Yaprak Dökümü 1967 * Son Gece 1967 * Bir Türk'e Gönül Verdim 1969 * Yaşamak Ne Güzel Şey 1969 * Atsız Cengaver 1970 * Ali Cengiz Oyunu 1971 * Acı Zafer 1972 * Aşk Fırtınası 1972 * Çöl Kartalı 1972 * Sultan Gelin 1973 * Aşk-ı Memnu 1975 * Yaşam Kavgası 1978 * Son Darbe (2) 1985 * Kurtar Beni 1987 * Arkadaşım Şeytan 1988 * Hanım 1988 * Karılar Koğuşu 1989 * İki Yabancı 1990 * Köpekler Adası 1996 * Kerem 1999 * Cumbadan Rumbaya 2005 } ==Referenceses== *This article incorporates text translated from the Turkish Wikipedia article Halit Refiğ, licensed under the . * Biography of Halit Refiğ ==External links== * ==BibliographyPublished screenplays=== *Refiğ, Halit.

The chemical formulation has failed over time, causing the magnetic oxide (which holds the musical information) to separate from the mylar backing.

It is the largest roller coaster in the park.

Suzuki produced the GS500 and GS500E from 1989 on and the fully faired model, GS500F from 2004 on. The GS500 is currently being produced and sold in South America. The GS500 has been described in the motorcycle literature as a best buy and an excellent first bike, with adequate if not exciting power for more experienced riders (approximately 40 HP at the rear wheel).“The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Motorcycles”, by the editors of Motorcyclist Magazine, Alpha Books, 1998, p324. The unfaired version of the GS500 was first sold in the UK in 1988 (model code GS500EJ) and the following year's model (code GS500EK) was released for sale in Europe and North America. It was equipped with an air-cooled parallel twin-cylinder engine derived from the earlier GS450. In the motorcycle market, the GS500 occupied the low end of Suzuki's mid-sized range for over twenty years. Suzuki also produced GS500 models, identified by a 'U' suffix, with engines restricted to satisfy the maximum power-to-weight ratio for use in countries where restrictive motorcycle licenses were issued (the GS500 meets current EU and UK licence level A2 conditions without restricting the engine) or for countries with a Learner Approved Motorcycle program (such as Australia and New Zealand) enhancing its worldwide popularity. == Model history == GS500 engineering lineage descends directly from Suzuki's first modern 4-stroke motorcycles. With the 1976 debut of the GS750 air-cooled inline-four, as well as the GS400 parallel-twin, Suzuki was building 4-stroke engines despite having produced only 2-stroke motors for 20 years. The Suzuki GS series soon expanded into larger and smaller four-cylinder bikes, the GS1000 and GS550 respectively, while the twin-cylinder engine was bored-out to become the GS425 twin. All of these models preserved the earliest GS engine layout: double overhead cams, 2 shim-adjusted valves per cylinder and a roller-bearing crankshaft. === GS500E inline four 1979-1982 === The GS500E motorcycle appeared in 1979, powered by a sleeved-down version of the GS550 engine (with smaller carburetors). The GS500E four was manufactured for markets where its smaller displacement was suited to insurance or license regulations. === GS500E parallel twin 1988-2000 === Suzuki modified the original GS series engine layout to produce a successor to the GS425, the GS450 twin, which had a new bottom-end design that used a one-piece 180° crankshaft running on plain bearings. A counterbalance shaft controlled engine vibrations. The displacement of this twin grew to in 1988 by means of a 3 mm larger bore, when it became the engine for the new GS500E. Although the GS500E twin was developed from an existing design, for the 1988 GS500EJ model Suzuki came up with a brand new frame, running gear and bodywork aimed at urban riders, novice motorcyclists and those on a budget. Additionally, the GS500EJ debuted with carburetors from the Mikuni ‘Slingshot’ series, a design which was simultaneously being used on the Suzuki GSX-R750 racer-replica. Although it did not produce as much horsepower as comparable multivalve engines, the two-valve GS500 engine had proportionally more torque at low speeds. As introduced in 1988 for the UK, and the GS500EK model in 1989 for Europe and North America, the bike came with a black painted engine mounted in a light grey frame and white wheels. These first GS500 bikes had low two-piece handlebars, giving the impression of clip-ons but were in fact mounted to the upper triple tree. In 1990 the handlebars were raised to a more standard height. A California-specific model for 1990 had a reduced fuel capacity, instead of 17 liters, to allow room under the tank for an evaporation canister. The GS500EN (1992) front suspension was improved by fitting spring preload adjusters to the forks. The painted wheels were changed in 1996 from the original white color to dark grey, and the frame on some models. The engine was no longer painted black. New front brake calipers for the GS500EV in 1997 had two large pistons, replacing the previous unequally- sized pistons. Starting in 1998 (GS500EW) French models were fitted with Mikuni BSR 34mm carburetors with a three-circuit design (pilot jet, mid-main jet, main jet) for precise fuel metering throughout the rev range. === GS500 2001—2016 === In 2001 the GS500 was given new bodywork and a 20-liter fuel tank. Wheel rims were painted light gray. All markets got the Mikuni BSR 34mm carburetors that had been used only on French models. Pulsed secondary air injection was used to reduce emissions. In addition to dropping the 'E' designation for the GS500, all Suzuki motorcycles went from using a single letter code for the model year (e.g., 'X' for 1999) to a letter-and-number code: K1 for 2001, K2 for 2002, L0 for 2010 and so on. In 2002 the wheel color became black, and from 2004 the frame was also painted black. After 2002 Suzuki stopped producing the GS500E for the US market and did not release a GS500 for 2003. In 2007, Suzuki dropped the GS500 from its lineup in the UK and Spain, but it continued to be sold in some other countries. As of 2016, Suzuki Motor Corporation is producing the GS500 at its Latin American manufacturing subsidiary Suzuki Motor de Colombia S.A. for sale in Colombia and for export to Chile (where it is marketed as a retro model) as well as to Ecuador. === GS500F 2004-2013=== In 2004, after a year hiatus, Suzuki came out with the GS500F to fill the void left (in the US market) by the GS500. In other countries the two models were sold side-by-side. This bike was very similar to the previous model, but came with a fully enclosed fairing, and the engine could be restricted for use in countries where restrictive motorcycle licenses are issued. The fairing offered a sportier, aggressive look and improved rider comfort by providing wind protection and better aerodynamics. An engine oil cooler was also added to improve reliability, and European models used a catalytic converter as well as pulsed secondary air injection to control emissions. The GS500F was dropped from the UK Suzuki range in 2007 and from the US range after 2009 model year, but was still available in Australia and Denmark. In January 2015 Cycle World added the GS500F to its roll of Best Used Bikes. ==Comparative reviews== In March 1992, Motorcyclist magazine, in an article titled \\"Budget Bullets,\\" compared the Kawasaki EX500, the Yamaha Seca II, the Honda Nighthawk CB750, and the Suzuki GS500. The Seca II came in first, with the CB750, and the GS500 following in that order. In a February 1992 article titled \\"Bargain Blasters,\\" Cycle World compared the GS500E to the Kawasaki EX500, the Seca II and the Suzuki Bandit GSF400. The GS500E finished last because it was relatively underpowered, but the testers praised its handling. In April 1994, in a follow-up article titled \\"Bargain Hunters,\\" Cycle World compared the Kawasaki Ninja 500R (the EX500 renamed), the Yamaha FZR600 and Seca II, in addition to the Suzuki Katana 600 and GS500E, choosing the Ninja as the best deal overall. The GS500E fared better as part of a 2002 Cycle World comparison of ten mid-sized streetbikes, which included the Royal Enfield Bullet Silver Classic 500 ES, Buell Blast, Suzuki LS650 Savage, Kawasaki KLR650 and MZ Skorpion Tour single-cylinder bikes, as well as the Kawasaki Vulcan 500 LTD, Honda VLX, Yamaha V-Star Custom and Kawasaki Ninja 500R twins. The GS500E narrowly beat the Ninja 500R for top honors \\"on the grounds of its $700 lower price tag.\\" ==References *Suzuki GS500F Official site * 150 pictures of Suzuki GS500, motor, carter, chain, clocks, tires, brakes, electrical wires, etc. Brand new Motorcycle with all original, no modifications.

Males may have greenish-yellow fur on the hindparts and on the ventral surfaces.Vonhof, M., M. Kalcounis. 1999. \\"Lavia frons\\". Mammalian Species, No. 614: 1-4. As their name suggests, the bat has wings that are reddish-yellow which is also the color of their other membranes as well as their noseleaf and ears. The membranes are largely hairless although there is some fur on the upper arms. The ears are fairly long and have a spiky tragus. They have an elongated noseleaf with a blunt but pointed tip. Although the yellow-winged bat has an advanced interfemoral membrane, they lacks an external tail. The dental formula is . Glands exist on the lower back of males and discharge a yellow substance. Females have false nipples near the anus and are used by the young to hold on to.Vaughan, T., R. Vaughan. 1987. \\"Parental Behavior in the African Yellow-Winged Bat\\". Journal of Mammalogy, 68: 217-223. ==Ecology== The yellow-winged bat has an extensive range throughout sub-Saharan Africa south to northern Zambia. The bat mostly lives in woodland and savannah habitats and in elevations of less than 2,000 m. They prefer acacia trees and thorn bushes near bodies of water,Nowak, R. M. 1994. Walker’s bats of the bats of the world. Johns Hopkins University Press. around which they fly.Happold, D. C. D. 1987. The mammals of Nigeria. Clarendon Press, Oxford. They prefer to live in areas where the vegetation is well spaced, which allows them to view more of their surroundings. The yellow- winged bat primarily roosts in small trees and shrubs. They can also be found roosting in trees cavities and buildings. They will roost in two separate trees; a primary and a peripheral tree. Bats use their primary roost in the morning and again before evening.Vaughan, T., R. Vaughan. 1986. \\"Seasonality and the Behavior of the African Yellow-Winged Bat\\". Journal of Mammalogy, 67: 91-102. Bats travel between primary and peripheral roost trees, especially on hot days, as they may need shade. These flights are typically short but longer flights have been recorded in midday. Unlike other false vampire bats, the yellow-winged bat feeds only on insects and not small vertebrates. They will feed on both soft- and hard-bodied insects. Bats may feed on termites, scarab beetles, orthopterans, lepidopterans and dipterans. The size of prey ranges from \\"very small to relatively large\\". The yellow-winged bat is a sit-and-wait predator. They perch and listen for prey and if it flies by, the bat launches their attack. This species, while potentially vulnerable to predation, is very alert. Mambas, bat hawks, night tree vipers and common kestrels may prey on this species. ==Behavior and life history== The yellow-winged bat is a monogamous species. Males and females form pairs during the breeding season and establish their own foraging territories. They are no more than 1m apart when roosting together. One member is vigilant during the day, and is able to turn its head 225° and move its ears. Between the foraging periods in the morning and evening, the male visits the peripheral roost, protecting it from potential intruders. In the morning, the pairs interact with each other before splitting up for the day. The male and female meet again at the primary roost tree before evening to interact. The maximum amount of male-female social interaction occurs between May and early June. This is when insects are more numerous and the young are able to hone their hunting skills. The exact time at which the yellow-winged bat gives birth can vary by region; parturition occurs at the close of the dry season in October in Zambia, while at Lake Baringo in Kenya, it occurs the start of the so-called \\"long rains\\" in April. Females are pregnant for around 3 months with only one young being born. During the first few weeks, young hang on to their mothers. Soon, the young stay at the roost for around a week and develop self-sustained flight. Young are weaned when they are around 55 days old. Calls produced by this species include search-phase echolocation calls and some social calls that can be heard by humans. Echolocation helps give the bat information on close objects. Social calls are associated with aggression, copulation or mother-offspring interactions. ==Status== Little is known about human impacts on the population of the yellow-winged bat and the population dynamics of the species have not been recorded. It does not appear to be particularly threatened but is likely not very common. ==References== *D.E. Wilson & D.M. Reeder, 2005: Mammal Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference.

The film introduces many character-specific themes (leitmotifs) that are used in at least one sequel as well, although most of the themes are only used again in Chamber of Secrets. These themes include two themes for Voldemort, two themes for Hogwarts, a Diagon Alley theme, a Quidditch theme, a flying theme, two friendship themes, and the main theme (\\"Hedwig's Theme\\").

He led his team to the school's first state title in basketball in 1994. Sesay starred at University of Mississippi, where he was named first-team all-SEC during both his junior and senior seasons and was the SEC's player of the year during his senior year. ==NBA== Sesay was selected 30th overall by the Dallas Mavericks in the 1998 NBA Draft. After the NBA's lockout ended, he tore his ACL during a condensed training camp and spent the entire 1999 season on the injured list. He then spent the 1999-2000 season in the CBA, playing 54 games for Rockford, where he averaged nearly 12 points and five boards per game. The Mavericks invited Sesay back to camp in 2000 but early in the preseason was dealt along with guard Dana Barros to Detroit for forward Loy Vaught. The next day, the Pistons released Sesay, and he returned to the CBA, playing 13 games for Quad City and finishing with averages of 10.5 points and 5.6 rebounds per game. He signed for a brief period in training camp with the Los Angeles Clippers on September 28, 2001, but did not see any official playing time with the team. He was cut after playing in just one game and was subsequently the second-round pick of the NBDL's Greenville Groove in the league's supplemental Draft. Playing for the NBDL's best team, Sesay displayed a multitude of talents and was one of the league's leaders in several categories, including scoring, rebounding, and assists. He was named first-team all-NBDL and the league's inaugural MVP, but the highpoint of Sesay's season had to be when he was called up on a 10-day contract by the Seattle SuperSonics on March 29, 2002 as injuries ravaged their roster. Though Sesay was expected to just be a warm body, he joined the team's rotation the next night in a win over the Portland Trail Blazers a night later, playing 12 minutes and scoring seven points in his NBA debut. Three nights later, still less than a week from the NBA's minor league, Sesay was playing 28 minutes against the Houston Rockets and was on the court down the stretch. Throughout the rest of the month, Sesay played intermittently as the Sonics clinched a playoff berth. When the second season started, the return to health of forwards Rashard Lewis and Vladimir Radmanovic put Sesay on the bench for only garbage minutes in the series' first games. After Lewis went out again midway through game three, Sesay became a key part of the team's game four rotation. His eight rebounds in 26 minutes helped out a 91-79 victory which forced a deciding game five. Ansu Sesay impressed enough during his eight-game stint with the Sonics, on a 46.3% shooting, that he made his way onto the team's playoff roster and was part of Nate McMillan’s postseason rotation. After the season, the Sonics re-signed the restricted free agent to a two-year deal, and Sesay was expected to be a part of the team's rotation. Sesay's season got off to a bad start when he strained his back during training camp, keeping him out of the majority of the Sonics preseason games. More of a concern in the long run for Sesay was his ability to make shots. By opening night, however, Sesay was in the lineup and played 16 minutes. Sesay dropped off dramatically in the next season. During the month of November 2002, he shot 29%, and scarcely improved to 30% in December 2002. Nonetheless, he remained valuable and stayed in the rotation because of his defensive ability. Sesay had the ability to defend shooting guards, small forwards and power forwards, and he saw action at each of the three positions. A natural small forward, Sesay started at power forward during the month of January when the Sonics were without injured Vladimir Radmanovic. Playing more regularly, Sesay's touch began to return, and he shot 41.9% in January 2003 and an even 50% in February 2003. The Sonics pair of trades at the trade deadline 2003 effectively ended Sesay's season. He was placed on the injured list with a lower back strain and remained there for the rest of the season. The Sonics missed his versatility during that period. In addition to the three positions mentioned above, the Sonics coaching staff also discussed playing Sesay at the point when backup Kenny Anderson was injured during the early part of the 2002-2003 season. He went on to play for the Golden State Warriors (2004-January 2005). He played 127 regular season NBA games with averages of 10.2 MPG, 3.2 PPG and 1.8 RPG on .434 field goal percentage and .640 free throw percentage in 10.2 minutes per game.

Published by BNP Media, it is generally considered \\"The Record\\" of architectural history. Throughout its 125 years in print, Architectural Record has fostered readership among architecture, engineering, and design professionals by featuring articles that showcase noteworthy architectural works throughout the global landscape. News, commentary, criticism, and continuing-education sections outline the scope of content. Of note are the glossy, high-quality photos that accentuate the featured projects, an attribute which makes the magazine accessible to the general public as well. Architectural Record holds a close relationship with the American Institute of Architects (AIA), particularly through the AIA Continuing Education sections offered both in the magazine and on the magazine's website. An underscore of this interrelationship, previous editor- in-chief Robert Ivy now acts as CEO of the AIA. ==Organization and history== Architectural Record began publication in 1891 by Clinton W. Sweet, who also published the Real Estate Record and Builders' Guide. Sweet and Frederick Warren Dodge soon formed a partnership. Dodge published an information service for builders and architects, originally in Boston and expanded to New York with the partnership. Together they established Sweet's Indexed Catalogue of Building Construction, a publication intended to be a summary filing of manufacturer's catalogs. In March 1938, the periodical American Architect and Architecture, first published in 1876, was merged with Architectural Record. This combined the two oldest architectural magazines in the United States. Sweet's Catalog and Architectural Record became part of F. W. Dodge Corporation in 1912. McGraw Hill acquired F. W. Dodge in 1961. McGraw-Hill divested the subsidiary McGraw-Hill Construction to Symphony Technology Group for US$320 million on September 22, 2014. The sale included Engineering News- Record, Architectural Record, Dodge and Sweet's. McGraw-Hill Construction has been renamed Dodge Data & Analytics. On July 1, 2015, the magazine was sold to BNP Media, along with Engineering News-Record and SNAP (a bi-monthly print product associated with Sweet’s). The editorial offices are located in Manhattan in the Empire State Building.Architectural Record Moves to the Empire State Building November 2, 2015 ==Record Houses== Record Houses is an annual awards program organized by Architectural Record. Winning projects are selected by an editorial jury and published in the magazine. Preference is given to \\"projects that incorporate innovation in program, building technology, materials, and form.\\" http://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/12029-record-houses-2017 ==Design Vanguard== Started in 2000, Design Vanguard is an annual feature whereby Architectural Record features emerging practices from around the world \\"that are demonstrating inventive approaches to shaping the built environment.\\" Notable firms that have been recognized as a Design Vanguard include Andres Jaque, Vo Trong Nghia Architects, Bjarke Ingels Group, nARCHITECTS, Tatiana Bilbao, Sou Fujimoto, Höweler+Yoon, Office Kersten Geers David Van Severen, LTL Architects, mos, Smiljan Radic, Evan Douglis, Michel Rojkind, Neri & Hu, Jeanne Gang, Peter Tolkin Architecture, Synthesis Design + Architecture, Oyler Wu Collaborative, SsD, IwamotoScott, Abruzzo Bodziak Architects, Merge Architects, Uufie, and WORKac. ==Women in Architecture== In 2014, Architectural Record initiated their \\"Women in Architecture Forum and Awards\\" program, \\"as a way to spotlight pioneering women pushing the boundaries of innovation and creativity in design.\\" Each year's five honorees are categorized as Design Leader, New Generation Leader, Innovator, Activist, and Educator. ==The Wild Men of Paris== Leading up to 1910 Gelett Burgess interviewed and wrote about avant-garde artists and artworks in and around Paris. The result of Burgess' investigation, \\"The Wild Men of Paris\\", was published in the May 1910 issue of Architectural Record; after his visit to the 1910 Salon des Indépendants, the anti-establishment art exhibition in Paris one year before the scandalous group exhibition that brought Cubism to the attention of the general public. An important painting by Pablo Picasso, Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, was reproduced in this article; one of the first mentions of the founders of Cubism, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, and Jean Metzinger to appear in the American press. Other important works were reproduced by Henri Matisse, Auguste Herbin, and André Derain. == References  * Architectural Record website * Early issues of Architectural Record, Hathi Trust Digital Library Category:Architecture magazines Category:Monthly magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines established in 1891 Category:Design magazines Category:Magazines published in New York City ","title":"Architectural Record"},{"id":"6236270","text":"The Citra Methodist Episcopal Church-South (also known as Citra United Methodist Church) is a historic church in Citra, Florida.

The Chilean Central Valley extends from the border with Peru to Puerto Montt in southern Chile, with a notable interruption at Norte Chico (27°20'–33°00' S). South of Puerto Montt the valley has a continuation as a series of marine basins up to the isthmus of Ofqui. Some of Chile's most populous cities lie within the valley including Santiago, Temuco, Rancagua, Talca and Chillán. ==Northern section (18°30'–27°20' S)== Topographic map showing the portion of the Chilean Central Valley known as Pampa del Tamarugal. In northernmost Chile the central valley is made up of the Pampitas, a series of small flats dissected by deep valleys.Börger, p. 40. Immediately south of the Pampitas, in Tarapacá Region and northern of Antofagasta Region, the Central Valley is known as Pampa del Tamarugal.Börger, p. 41.Brüggen, p. 6. Contrary to the Pampitas valleys descending from the Andes do not incise the plains but merge into the surface of Pampa del Tamarugal at a height of c. 1500 m. The westernmost portion of Pampa del Tamarugal has a height of 600 m. This western part contain a series of raised areas called pampas and basins containing salt flats. Interconnecting basins are important corridors for communication and transport in northern Chile.Börger, p. 42. South of Loa River the valley continues, flanked by Cordillera Domeyko to east, until it is ends at the latitude of Taltal (25°17' S). It re-appears around Chañaral (26°20' S) as an isolated basin surrounded by mountains and hills.Börger, p. 43. This 250 km long and up to 70 km wide basin is called Pampa Ondulada or Pampa Austral.Börger, p. 47. As the Pampa Ondulada is extinguished at Copiapó River (27°20' S) in the Norte Chico region running south of this river there is no proper Central Valley, only a few narrow north-south depressions that align with geological faults.Brüggen, p. 5. In the northern section of the central valley vegetation is extremely scarce as result of conditions of extreme aridity in Atacama Desert. Only to the south in Atacama Region does a Chilean Matorral vegetation exist. The northern portion of the matorral is made up by the Nolana leptophylla–Cistanthe salsoloides association while the southern half by the Skytanthus acutus–Atriplex deserticola association.Luebert & Pliscoff, pp. 113–114.Luebert & Pliscoff, pp. 123–124. ==Central section (33°00'–41°30' S)== Topographic map showing the Chilean Central Valley from 35°50' to 38°30' S. The main portion the Central Valley extends from Tiltil (33°05' S) near Santiago to Temuco (38°45' S).Brüggen, p. 4. The Coast Range and the Andes almost merge in two locations: one between Santiago and Rancagua and another between San Fernando and Rengo. The result is the enclosure of the Central Valley into two smaller basins in the north: Santiago Basin and Rancagua Basin.Börger, p. 97.Börger, p. 99. The valley runs an un-interrupted length of 360 km from Angostura de Pelequén in the north to Bío Bío River (37°40' S) in the south. It broadens from 12 km at Molina (35°05' S) in the north to 74 km in the south at Laja (37°15' S) the relief being gently undulating. Conglomerate of Andean provenance cover large swathes of the Central Valley being less common to the west near the Coast Range. Occasionally the valley contains isolated hills and mountains made up of basement rocks. At the latitudes of Temuco the Coast Range is subdued to such degree the Central Valley coalesces with the coastal plains. In the 110 km between Gorbea and Paillaco (c. 39–40° S) the Central Valley is inexistent as the region is instead crossed by a series of east-west mountainous ridges and broad fluvial valleys.Börger, p. 122. South of this region the Central Valley re-appears in the south to extend into Osorno and Puerto Montt (41°30' S).Brüggen, p. 2. This southern section is 190 km long from north to south. The Central Valley south of Bío Bío River has been influenced by volcanism and past glaciations giving origin to the ñadis and moraines that cover parts of the valley.Börger, p. 123. The natural vegetation of the central section vary from north to south. To a lesser degree vegetation also vary towards the foothills of the Andes and the Chilean Coastal Range. From Santiago to Linares thorny woodlands of Acacia caven are dominant.Luebert & Pliscoff, pp. 130–133. In Ñuble Region two sclerophyll vegetation types cover the territory. These are the associations of Lithrea caustica–Peumus boldus and Quillaja saponiana–Fabiana imbricata.Luebert & Pliscoff, pp. 144–147. From Bío Bío River to the south Nothofagus obliqua becomes the dominant tree species.Luebert & Pliscoff, pp. 149–150.Luebert & Pliscoff, pp. 157–158.

He was a representative to the Congress of Tucumán which on 9 July 1816 declared the Independence of Argentina. Gorriti was born in Jujuy to Feliciana Coeto and Ignacio de Gorriti Navarro, members of the local gentry. He and his brother, Juan Ignacio de Gorriti (later a prominent priest and lawmaker), studied at the Montserrat School in Córdoba. In 1788 he entered the University of Chuquisaca, graduating in canonical and civil law. He was forced to return to Jujuy on the death of his father to look after the family and their interests. In 1802 he married Facunda Zuviría. In 1810, following the May Revolution, Gorriti became an active and vocal supporter of the revolutionary cause. He campaigned with the Army of the North and alongside General Martín Güemes, and was subsequently elected by a grateful Salta to the Tucumán Congress, serving in 1816 for the declaration. When the Congress moved to Buenos Aires in 1817, he resigned to continue to work in Salta with Güemes. He had a distinguished role in the campaign, organising the gaucho cavalry and in 1820 won a key battle against the royalists. Gorriti was made governor of Salta Province in 1822 and served with distinction, having a second term between 1827 and 1829. He had several further military successes both against Spanish forces and against the Federals under Juan Facundo Quiroga. Quiroga's later success, however, obliged him to go in exile to Bolivia, where he died penniless with many children.

Motorman Donald Williams died from multiple burns. Five people were also injured; the accident caused flames to rise fifty feet in the air and created a plume of black smoke visible for miles. Photographs appear to indicate the crossing signal equipment was working properly, with warning lights continuing to warn motorists after the collision occurred, but a report by the National Transportation Safety Board suggested the lights were intermittently working as the tank truck approached the crossing, as mentioned by eyewitnesses.https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/RHR8203.aspx SEPTA was using a single RDC #9164 which was not equipped with signal excitation equipment required for single-car operation. The Reading Railroad had two RDC's equipped for single car operation (#9151 & 9152), which were transferred to SEPTA, neither of which were in use on this holiday weekend when rail traffic was especially light. Also, due to the acute angle of the railroad crossing and the buildings nearby, the truck driver could not see the RDC approaching from his right until it was too late to stop short of a collision.

It is a Latin Catholic titular see. == Diocese == The sagas tell that Sokki Þórisson, a wealthy farmer of the Brattahlíð area, launched the idea of a separate bishop for Greenland in the early 12th century and got the approval of the Norwegian King Sigurd I Magnusson 'the Crusader', (1103–1130). Most of the clergy came from Norway. == Bishops == * The first bishop of Garðar, Arnaldur, was ordained by the Archbishop of Lund in 1124. He arrived in Greenland in 1126. He began the construction of the cathedral dedicated to St Nicholas, patron saint of sailors. * The diocese was first assigned to the ecclesiastical province of the German Metropolitan Archbishopric of Bremen. The diocese was subject to the Archdiocese of Lund (present-day Sweden) from 1126–1152. Arnaldur returned to Norway in 1150 and became bishop of Hamar (Norway) in 1152. * In 1152, this diocese, as well as those of Iceland, the Isle of Man, the Orkney Islands and the Faroe Islands, became suffragans to the newly established Norwegian Metropolitan Archdiocese of Nidaros (now Trondheim). The second bishop was Jón Knútr, who served from 1153–1186. * The third bishop was Jón Árnason (nicknamed Smyril). He took office in 1189. In 1202–1203 he went on a pilgrimage to Rome and met Pope Innocent III. He died in Garðar in 1209 and was buried there, most likely in the Northern Chapel of the cathedral. * The next bishop, Helgi, arrived in Greenland in 1212 and was bishop until his death in 1230. * In 1234, Nikulás was ordained. He arrived in Greenland in 1239. He died in 1242. * Ólafr was ordained in the same year, arriving in 1247. He remained bishop until the mid-1280s. He was abroad from 1264 to 1280, thus hardly serving in his own diocese. * The next bishop was Þórdr, who stayed in Garðar from 1289 until his return to Norway in 1309. * The next bishop was Árni, from 1315 to 1347. Due to poor communication between Greenland and Norway, it was assumed that he had died and a new bishop (Jón Skalli) was ordained in 1343. When it was discovered that bishop Árni was still alive, Skalli resigned and never went to Greenland. * After Árni's death in 1347, worsening communications delayed the arrival of the next bishop, Norwegian cleric Ivar Bardsson. He served as principal during the interim period. Bishop Álfr was ordained in 1365 and served as the last effectively residential bishop of Garðar until 1378. * The Greenland diocese disappeared in the 15th century, when ships from Norway stopped. === List of residential bishops === Crosier and episcopal ring of a 13th century Greenlandic bishop, probably Óláfr (1247-1280) { +Residential bishops !Bishop !!

Its single incumbent of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank was Edward William Clark, Auxiliary bishop of Los Angeles (16 January 2001 – present). == Remains == Presently the settlement of Igaliku is situated on the same location. The site has been the subject of archaeological investigations since the 1830s. The cathedral was the primary target of much of the archaeological work and was fully excavated in 1926 by Danish archaeologist (1888–1951). Nørlund made several scientific studies in Greenland starting in 1921 and ending in 1932. Many Norse settlement ruins remain visible in Igaliku. The ruins mostly consist of the stone foundations of the walls in their original positions so that the extent of the settlement, both individual buildings and collectively, can be determined and understood. The main ruin is of the Garðar Cathedral, a cross-shaped church built of sandstone in the 12th century. The maximum length is 27 m, the width 16 m. Two large barns are on the site, able to have held up to 160 cows. == See also == * List of Catholic dioceses in Denmark * Western Settlement * Middle Settlement * Eastern Settlement * Bishop of Greenland (Lutheran Bishop) == References ces and external links == * Grønland i middelalderen fra landnam til undergang * GCatholic * Grønlands Forhistorie (Gyldendal København, 2005) * Diamond, Jared M.

It has been rated as the most prestigious private university in Honduras (Unimer Research International, amongst other independent firms), and throughout its history has demonstrated important leadership in the country, based on academic excellence, high technology, and promoting entrepreneurship; supported by strong internationalization programs for its students and faculty. This makes UNITEC one of the most recognized educational institutions in Central America also, thanks to its innovative educational model (SENECA, Laspau-Harvard), for its interest in contributing to national extension of society, and leading the development of various projects that have contributed to the development of marginalized populations in Honduras. This university also provides a choice of higher education to working adults through CEUTEC (Centre for Technological Development), which began operations in 2005. On that same year UNITEC became a member of Laureate International Universities, the world’s most important private university network, with 55 universities in 25 countries in North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia.

The Owls compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the East Division of Conference USA (CUSA). The Owls' head coach is Willie Taggart, who was previously the head coach of Florida State University. Florida Atlantic has produced a Sun Belt Conference co-championship team in 2007, two Conference USA championships in 2017 and 2019, along with 4 postseason bowl appearances and one appearance in the 2003 I-AA Playoffs. The Owls play their home games at FAU Stadium which has a seating capacity of 29,419. ==HistoryHoward Schnellenberger era (2001–2011)=== Florida Atlantic University football began play in 2001 with legendary coach Howard Schnellenberger serving as head coach until 2011. Schnellenberger was a former offensive coordinator with the NFLs Indianapolis Colts and Miami Dolphins who, as a head coach, turned around a moribund Miami football program and won a national championship in his fifth season in 1983 after back to back nine win seasons in 1980 and 1981. Schnellenberger also turned around a downtrodden Louisville football program, winning the Fiesta Bowl in 1990. Coach Schnellenberger (blue jacket) After competing their first four years as an NCAA Division I-AA independent, the Owls moved to Division I-A and the Sun Belt Conference. Starting with the 2013–14 school year, FAU athletics have competed in Conference USA. In 1998, Florida Atlantic University announced it was pursuing the creation of an NCAA football program and that Howard Schnellenberger was going to lead the charge, as director of football operations and head coach. After his success in rebuilding programs at Miami and Louisville, Coach Schnellenberger now undertook the role of building a program from scratch. Much like his time at Miami and Louisville, Coach Schnellenberger did not shy from placing lofty expectations and high goals on his newly created program. Even before FAU would play an intercollegiate game, Coach Schnellenberger explained the goal of FAU football would be to play the best teams it can schedule, in order for the program to aim for a national championship in Division I-A football. These extreme goals were not unusual from a man like Coach Schnellenberger. At Louisville, facing threats from the administration that the football team would be terminated, Schnellenberger made the bold (and now famous) prediction, \\"[We are] on a collision course with the national championship. The only variable is time.”http://www.msnsportsnet.com/page.cfm?section=6488 On August 29, 2000, the first practice was held at the Boca Raton campus of FAU, and 164 students showed up to try out for the team. During the August 29, 2000 first practice, dubbed the inaugural scrimmage game, FAU continued the tradition of Homecoming King, this time including the crowning ceremony of the King as part of the halftime festivities. The Homecoming King crown was bestowed upon Wayne Burns, having been voted in by the majority of student population from across all the campuses at the time, which totaled five, then running a Q&A; gauntlet alongside the top three candidates, conducted by a committee of students and faculty, who then voted to determine if Mr. Burns would move to the winners circle or if the next candidate would get the crown. Mr. Burns was driven around the scrimmage game field in a convertible Rolls Royce to wave to the 164 students in the stands, many of whom voted for him. Wayne Burns was and is the oldest Homecoming King to ever receive the honor at FAU. Florida Atlantic joined NCAA Division I-AA, now known as Division I FCS, as an independent team for the 2001 season. Its first-ever intercollegiate competition was against Slippery Rock University, which the Owls lost 40–7 in front of 25,632 fans at Joe Robbie Stadium, now known as Hard Rock Stadium. The team finished its inaugural season at 4–6 and followed the next season at 2–9. Major accomplishments in its first two seasons include the program's first win, which came in its second game, against Bethune–Cookman, 31–28, and won in the first meeting with newly created South Florida rival, Florida International University, 31–21. On September 15, 2007 FAU defeated its first Big Ten opponent with a 42–39 victory over Minnesota. Led by Rusty Smith, FAU beat Troy in the final game of the 2007 season to become Sun Belt Conference champions and received an invitation to the 2007 New Orleans Bowl, its first ever bowl bid. As a result, in just the seventh year of the football program's history, and the third year playing in Division I, Florida Atlantic set an NCAA mark by becoming the second-youngest program ever to receive an invitation to a bowl game. They were surpassed only by the undefeated 1958 Air Force Falcons, who had played just one year of Division 1 football before being invited to the Cotton Bowl, where they played to a scoreless tie against the TCU Horned Frogs on January 1, 1959. On August 11, 2011, Howard Schnellenberger announced he would retire at the end of the season. The Owls ended the 2011 season 1–11, with the only victory coming from a 38–35 home win over UAB. ===Carl Pelini era (2012–2013)=== On December 1, 2011 FAU hired Carl Pelini, the Nebraska Cornhuskers defensive coordinator to become their new head coach, to succeed Schnellenberger. On October 30, 2013, Pelini resigned from his position after admitting to school officials he was using illegal drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine. He, along with defensive coordinator Pete Rekstis, officially stepped down from their positions only three days before the school's homecoming game, which they won 34–17 under interim head coach Brian Wright. Under Pelini, the Owls compiled a 5–14 record. Wright finished the 2012–13 season as the interim head coach, winning the team's last four games and led the Owls to its first bowl-eligible season since 2008–09. The Owls finished 6–6 for the season but were not invited to a bowl game. ===Charlie Partridge era (2014–2016)=== On December 16, 2013, FAU announced it had hired Charlie Partridge as head coach. Prior to accepting the job at FAU, Partridge was the defensive line coach at Arkansas. On November 27, 2016 FAU fired Partridge after 3 consecutive 3–9 seasons. ===Lane Kiffin era (2017–2019)=== On December 12, 2016, it was announced that former USC and Tennessee head coach Lane Kiffin would become the Owls' next head coach. Kiffin resigned from FAU on December 7, 2019 after a 49–6 blowout win against the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and before FAU's Boca Raton Bowl appearance against SMU Mustangs to become the head coach at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss).

It was recorded on February 13 and February 14, 1970 at the Fillmore East in New York City, and released in February 1996. It was the first of the Dick's Picks CDs to have three discs. It was also the first Dead album to include the song \\"Mason's Children\\".\\"Mason's Children\\" on DeadDisc.com Dick's Picks Volume 4 was the second album of live material from the 2/13/70 and 2/14/70 concerts. The first was History of the Grateful Dead, Volume One (Bear's Choice), which was released in 1973. The Grateful Dead played three sets of music at each of these concerts — a relatively short electric set, an acoustic set, and another, longer electric set, followed by an encore. Dick's Picks Volume 4 contains the complete third sets of both shows, plus two additional songs. ==The Fillmore East shows== On February 11, 13, and 14, 1970, the Grateful Dead — along with the Allman Brothers Band and Love — performed at Bill Graham's Fillmore East auditorium in New York City. The February 13 and February 14 Dead shows were widely regarded as among the band's best concerts, even before the release of Dick's Picks Volume 4. In addition to the evidence offered by Bear's Choice, high quality soundboard bootlegs of the concerts had been in circulation for quite some time. In a 1993 poll of Grateful Dead tape traders, based on the concert recordings then in circulation, the 2/13/70 show was ranked #2 on the list of all-time favorite Dead tapes, and 2/14/70 was #17. (The May 8, 1977 concert at Cornell University's Barton Hall received the top ranking.) The same poll rated the 2/13/70 versions of \\"Dark Star\\", \\"The Other One\\", and \\"Turn On Your Love Light\\" as the best ever. (The \\"Dark Star\\" played on August 27, 1972, in Veneta, Oregon, was ranked #2. The February 27, 1969 version from the Fillmore West, included in Live/Dead, was #9.)Scott, John W; Dolgushkin, Mike; Nixon, Stu. DeadBase VIII: The Complete Guide to Grateful Dead Song Lists, 1994, DeadBase, , p. 356, 360, 361 Selections from the Allman Brothers Band's performances at this set of concerts were released as the album Fillmore East, February 1970. ==Critical reception== Dick's Picks Volume 4 received a rating of five stars out of five from Rolling Stone, The Music Box magazine, and Allmusic. Greg Kot of Rolling Stone wrote, \\"But when the early Dead were at their best, few American bands were better in concert. Exhibit A is Volume Four, which culls highlights from two masterly 1970 performances at the Fillmore East. Here the full range of the band's arsenal is represented: the luminous 'Dark Star', a raging 'Not Fade Away', the sheer nastiness of McKernan on his showpiece, 'Turn On Your Love Light'.\\"Kot, Greg. Review of Dick's Picks volumes 1 through 13, Rolling Stone, May 27, 1999 In The Music Box, John Metzger said, \\"I don't think I need to tell anyone about the performance of the Grateful Dead on February 13 – 14, 1970, as these have long been fan favorites.... If you have never heard the February 13 performance of Dark Star / That's It for the Other One / Lovelight, you must be living in a cave or have never seen the Grateful Dead. It's one of the most amazing performances they ever did. Over 90 minutes of pure bliss that is sure to convert the unconverted.\\"Metzger, John. Review of Dick's Picks Volume 4, The Music Box, Volume 3 Number 4, June 1996 William Ruhlmann of Allmusic wrote, \\"It isn't just the set list that makes this a legendary show, it's the playing: amazing interaction among the players on every song, with Garcia noodling his way to nirvana. While it would be an exaggeration to say that if you own this three-CD, three-hour-and-ten-minute album you have all you need of the Grateful Dead on disc, the overstatement is only slight.\\"[ Ruhlmann, William. Review of Dick's Picks Volume 4, Allmusic] On Jambands.com, Dan Alford wrote, \\"This performance really needs no introduction; it’s one of the most famous two night stands in the Grateful Dead’s history, and if you don’t think 5/8/77 is the best GD performance, it’s possible you think 2/13/70 is.... Easily one of the best moments of the 30 year trip.\\" ==Grayfolded== Over 14 minutes of the 2/13/70 version of \\"Dark Star\\" was included on the Grateful Dead / John Oswald plunderphonics collaboration project Grayfolded. The section of music used was the jam in between the first and second verse, affectionately called the \\"Feelin' Groovy Jam\\" by Deadheads, because of the musical similarity to Simon & Garfunkel's \\"The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)\\". The section of Grayfolded where this can be found is on Disc 2, track 2 called \\"73rd Star Bridge Sonata\\". ==Set lists== The concert set lists for the 2/13/70 and 2/14/70 shows at the Fillmore East were:Scott, John W; Dolgushkin, Mike; Nixon, Stu.

She is also a speaker, blogger, syndicated columnist, author, and reality show host. A mother who lives in Queens, her controversial decision to let her then-9-year-old son take the New York City Subway home alone became a national story and prompted massive media attention. She was dubbed, \\"America's Worst Mom.\\" In response, Skenazy founded the book and blog \\"Free-Range Kids,\\" with the aim of \\"fighting the belief that our children are in constant danger from creeps, kidnapping, germs, grades, flashers, frustration, failure, baby snatchers, bugs, bullies, men, sleepovers and/or the perils of a non-organic grape.\\" Let Grow, co-founded in 2018 with Daniel Shuchman, Dr. Peter Gray and Prof. Jonathan Haidt, continues the quest to make it \\"easy, normal and legal\\" to give kids back some old-fashioned independence of thought and deed ==Career== Skenazy is a 1981 graduate of Yale University. She got her master's degree from Columbia in 1983. Skenazy spent fourteen years as a columnist for the New York Daily News, but was fired in December 2006. She moved to The New York Sun and wrote there until it shut down in 2008. Skenazy also wrote and reported for NPR, as well as CNBC, and was featured in the Bravo series Tabloid Wars. Lenore Skenazy speaking at PorcFest, New Hampshire Porcupine Freedom Festival Skenazy's April 1, 2008 column in The New York Sun, \\"Why I Let My 9-Year-Old Ride the Subway Alone,\\" described her making the controversial decision to let her son take the New York City Subway home alone, which was completed without incident. The piece resulted in a flood of reactions ranging from accusations of child abuse to fond memories of first- time subway trips and childhood freedom. The story was covered on The Today Show, Fox News, NPR, and MSNBC two days after the column appeared, later becoming worldwide news and being featured on Penn & Teller: Bullshit!, The View, Nightline, Good Morning America, CBS News, NBC Nightly News, Anderson Cooper, Dr. Phil, Nancy Grace, The BBC, The CBC, ABC in Australia, etc. In 2015, she was profiled in The New Yorker and The New York Times. The popularity of Skenazy's blog led to the creation of the book, Free-Range Kids, published in 2009 by John Wiley & Sons. On the blog, Lenore proposed May 22, 2010 as the first \\"Take Our Children to the Park & Leave Them There Day\\" as a day for children to learn how to play by themselves without constant supervision. It has been celebrated every year since. Skenazy also became the host of the reality television show World's Worst Mom on Discovery Life. The 13-episode series features Skenazy visiting extremely anxious parents, including the mom of a 10-year-old who still spoon-fed him, the mom of an 8-year-old who bought him a skateboard but only let him \\"ride\\" it on the grass, and the mom of a 13-year-old who still took him into the ladies room. With humor, kindness, and some firmness, Skenazy separated the parents from their children and had the children do some tasks on their own, such as running an errand, or learning, at age 10, how to ride a bike. In the end, 12 of the 13 couples relaxed so much, that they became \\"Free-Range Parents\\" themselves. Now Skenazy lectures around the world, including speeches at Microsoft, DreamWorks, Audi, The Yale Child Study Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Wellesley, the Sydney Opera House and schools and conferences too numerous to count. At Let Grow, Skenazy's goal is to renormalize kids doing things on their own. She says this is easiest when whole groups \\"Let go and Let Grow\\" together, so the adults don't feel foolish or fearful taking their eyes off their kids. Let Grow's two school initiatives to increase kids' (and parents') confidence are: The Let Grow Project—Teachers tell the kids to go home and ask their parents if they can do one thing on their own that they haven't done yet—walk the dog, run an errand, play outside. This little push breaks the ice of fear. When the kids come back, flush with independence, anxiety is replaced by a flood of joy. The project changes parents as much as the kids. The Let Grow Play Club—This is Dr. Peter Gray's initiative: Schools stay open before or after school for free play. Adults are on hand for emergencies, but otherwise don't intervene. Kids of all ages playing together make up their own games, solve their own problems, learning the social- emotional skills (focus, empathy, compromise) they can't get in the classroom. The PBS NewsHour profiled these initiatives in 2018, as did The Wall Street Journal and NPR. LAWS: In 2018, Utah became the first state in the U.S. to pass the Free-Range Parenting bill, assuring parents that they can give their kids some independence without this being mistaken for neglect. Several states are considering similar bills as of 2019. ==Bibliography== * * Who’s the Blonde that Married What’s-His-Name: The Ultimate Tip of the Tongue Test of Everything You Know You Know…But Can’t Remember Right Now (Penguin Books, June 2009) * \\"The Dysfunctional Family Christmas Songbook\\" (Broadway Books, 2004), with co-author John Boswell. *Reader's Digest.

It was during his final season with the team that Nickerson drew the attention of NHL scouts, and in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft the Dallas Stars drafted Nickerson in the third round with the 99th overall pick. Nickerson spent his next season at Clarkson University, where he racked up 179 penalty minutes in 38 games. Nickerson signed a three- year entry level contract before playing in Victoriaville. Due to the NHL lockout, he was sent to the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League's Victoriaville Tigres, and finally turned pro in the Finnish SM-liiga, playing with Ässät. Started 2005-2006 in the Dallas Stars training camp where he scored a goal on Ty Conklin in a NHL exhibition game versus the Edmonton Oilers. Nickerson was then assigned to Iowa of the AHL where he played 4 exhibition games, registering one fighting major, before ending up in Pori, Finland.

Nickerson had a try-out with Danish team Esbjerg IK in November 2010 but failed to secure a contract. The Fife Flyers confirmed the signing of Matt Nickerson for the 2013/14 Rapid Solicitors Elite Ice Hockey League season. Nickerson quickly became a fan favorite at Fife where his tough edge added some much needed backbone to a team which had been bullied on the ice in the past. Playing 45 games in his first season he was an integral part in the run to the EIHL playoff semi final game where Fife lost to Belfast by 1-0. His unending desire to stand up for his team mates earned great respect from the Fife support although he did draw the attention of the EIHL referees and in December 2013 he was handed a 12-game suspension (which was reduced upon appeal) for a fight during a game against the Braehead Clan. As part of the Fife Flyers community outreach program Nickerson and team mates visited the children's hospice in Kinross operated by C.H.A.S. Touched by the work carried out by the charity Nickerson offered to let fans shave off his impressive trademark beard to raise money for the hospice. This charitable act received many plaudits from across the UK hockey community.

It formed part of New Zealand's national rail network and operated from 1917 until 1968. == Construction == A combination of political pressure and the economic potential of the forestry in the Raetihi area motivated the construction of this line. In 1911, the government granted approval to construct the line, with the line intended to diverge from the North Island Main Trunk in Rangataua, but construction did not commence until 1913, when the site of the junction was changed to Ohakune. The outbreak of World War I a year later caused delays in both supplies and finding available manpower; nonetheless, work progressed steadily through the war years and the line was opened on 18 December 1917. Despite proclamations that it was the start of a new route to Whanganui, the line was never extended beyond Raetihi. == Stations == The following stations were located on the Raetihi Branch (in brackets is the distance from Ohakune): *Rochfort (3 km) *Makaranui (8 km) *Pakihi (11 km) *Raetihi (13 km) == Operation == The line fulfilled its intended purpose to carry timber to markets further afield, with large quantities railed in the branch's early years. As the forests were removed, land became available for farming and agriculture became important to the line's economic fortunes. Livestock was of particular seasonal importance. Passenger trains did not operate, but passenger carriages were attached to goods services to create what were known as mixed trains. A 1930 Royal Commission into the state of New Zealand's railway network recommended the termination of passenger services, but this was not actually done until 16 December 1951. Another Royal Commission had taken place in 1950, but the line had remarkably been excluded. By the late 1950s, timber traffic had declined sharply, and road transport was creating strong competition for the branch line. Maintenance on the line had been deferred as it was not seen as a necessity or financially justifiable, but as repairs became more necessary, the line's future was put under review in 1967. Financial losses had been steadily increasing, and the review called for closure of the line. Accordingly, this took place on 1 January 1968. == The branch today == Two significant relics from the Raetihi Branch still exist. The Raetihi station building has been relocated from its old site to a new location in the town and has been restored as part of the Waimarino Museum. At the other end of the branch, near Ohakune's famous big carrot, an old truss bridge remains in place. For the rest of the line's length, notable remnants are absent, but the formation can be sighted at points, especially where embankments or cuttings were required. == References  Bibliography === * * Hermann, Bruce J; North Island Branch Lines p 44 (2007, New Zealand Railway & Locomotive Society, Wellington) * Leitch, David, and Scott, Brian; Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, Grantham House, 1998 revised edition * Category:Railway lines in New Zealand Category:Rail transport in Manawatū- Whanganui Category:Railway lines opened in 1917 Category:Railway lines closed in 1968 Category:Closed railway lines in New Zealand ","title":"Raetihi Branch"},{"id":"6236677","text":"Yvon Pierre Lambert (born May 20, 1950) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey forward. Lambert was born in Drummondville, Quebec. Although drafted in 1970 by the Detroit Red Wings, Lambert started his National Hockey League (NHL) career with the Montreal Canadiens in 1973. He spent nine years in Montreal before being traded to the Buffalo Sabres. Lambert is best known for scoring the winning goal in overtime of game seven of the 1979 Stanley Cup Semi-Finals against the Boston Bruins, the culmination of an exciting game most memorable for a career-damaging coaching error by Don Cherry with two minutes left in regulation. Lambert won four consecutive Stanley Cups with the Canadiens from 1976 to 1979. Lambert played his final two seasons with the Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League (AHL), winning the 1982-83 Calder Cup. He retired after the Americans lost to the Maine Mariners in Game 5 of the 1983-84 Calder Cup Finals. After being traded to Montreal, a year after being drafted by the Red Wings, Lambert thought he would never make it to the NHL since the Canadiens had a young and talented squad. It was his desire to get back to Detroit, which had an aging squad at the time, including Gordie Howe and Alex Delvecchio, that made him push himself to perform well with the Port Huron Flags since every young player at time knew they would probably have a chance to replace these players. After a great season with Port Huron, Ned Harkness, the Red Wings coach, told Lambert that if he stayed in form he would have a good chance to be given another chance with the Red Wings the following season. In August 1972, Lambert was surprised by reading in the newspaper that his services were being kept by the Canadiens. He stated in French, \\"During the first day at the camp, at the forum of Montreal, there was 80 players and I find myself next to Henri Richard, Yvan Cournoyer, Serge Savard, Jacques Lemaire, and Larry Robinson. Whew! I felt so small\\". ==Career statistics== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text- align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

Lucas as Andrew, two highschool youth who have a crush on each other, but have difficulties to reconcile with their own sexuality in a small town. Vacationland is one of the official slogans for the state of Maine where the events of the film are taking place. ==Synopsis== The film, set in Bangor, Maine, is based on some of Verow's experiences in Maine. Joe (Brad Hallowell), 18-year-old high school senior lives with his single mother and his older sister Teresa (Hilary Mann), who works in a convenience store. They live in a notorious estate called the \\"Capehart Projects\\". Joe dreams of moving away from town for attending an arts school. Joe is attracted to men and has a crush on his friend Andrew (Gregory J. Lucas), a football player in his high school. Upon the encouragement of Joe's friend Kris (Mindy Hofman) and Andrew's friend Mandy (Jennifer Stackpole), they explore their mutual attraction for each other and fall further in love. Kris and Mandy also experiment sex together. During one of his first sexual encounters with Andrew, Joe also admits to Andrew having been gang-raped by three older men, after witnessing his older friend Tim being raped by the same men at the warehouse he works in. Meanwhile Joe is determined to leave town to pursue arts and design studies at a college in Rhode Island, particularly after his sister leaves to Los Angeles having robbed the convenience store she has been working in for years to arrange for her airline ticket. Joe has a fling with the French language teacher in a bathroom and then blackmails him to get good grades, and to get the crucial recommendation he needs, as his passport to arts school. Joe also befriends an elderly disabled artist named Victor (Charles Ard) who hires him as a model and a house boy. Joe actually moves in with Victor in his loft above the local opera house. For securing his services and occasional sexual favors, Victor provides Joe with recommendation and help to be accepted to an arts school, and decides to commit suicide with an overdose of drugs leaving all his money and possessions to Joe to fulfill his dreams. Andrew sinks into further trouble, theft and heavy drinking, while he's trying to reconcile with his own sexuality and what he wants to do with the rest of his life, and how can he keep Joe who is determined to go away. During their escapades to nearby Styxx gay venue, Joe happens to recognize his childhood friend Tim (Michael John Dion), now a gay man, but Tim shoves him off. Joe also recognizes one of his tormenters at the club and decides to get even with the help of Andrew, but insisting beforehand to make him realize that he was the boy the man had raped. The film ends with Joe and Andrew contemplating on what they need to do with their lives. ==Cast== * Brad Hallowell as Joe * Gregory J.

The game, featuring the official licensed team and player names from all 30 Major League Baseball teams, was created by games company 3DO which subsequently filed for bankruptcy in 2003 soon after the release of the final version of the series, High Heat Major League Baseball 2004. In August 2003, Microsoft purchased the rights to the High Heat franchise from 3DO; however, Microsoft has yet to develop a new title in the series.

Dollard started his National Hockey League career with the Montreal Canadiens in 1951. He would spend eight years in Montreal before being traded to the Chicago Black Hawks. He won four Stanley Cups with Montreal and one with Chicago. He started out with the Jr. Canadiens of the QJHL where he skated for two seasons from 1947 to 1949. There he demonstrated an offensive touch and an ability to play a tough game of defence at the other end of the ice. In 1949–50, St. Laurent started a three-year relationship with the Royal Montreal Hockey Club of the QSHL. He spent most of his time sharpening the finer points of his game while putting them to the occasional test by joining the Habs for a couple of stints. Around 1952–53, however, the Canadiens began to introduce significant new blood in the form of Jacques Plante and Dickie Moore among others. Dollard helped Montreal win the Stanley Cup in 1953. One of the others included St. Laurent who settled onto the Habs' blueline corps as a stay-at-home regular for the next six seasons. His efforts contributed to three straight Stanley Cup victories between 1956, 1957, 1958. After the third championship, St. Laurent was sold to the Chicago Black Hawks who were gradually assembling a lineup bent on bringing the Cup to town after a lengthy absence. In 1960–61, the team finally ended the championship drought by ousting the Red Wings in the finals. St. Laurent played for the Hawks until the end of the 1961–62 campaign. The following year, he was dispatched to the Quebec Aces of the AHL, during which St. Laurent took a hard fall to the ice, breaking his leg and ending his aspirations to make it back to the NHL. At the end of the season, he announced his retirement. On May 17, 1952, he was married to Jessie FitzPatrick (1929-1993). St. Laurent died on April 6, 2015, aged 85.https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/montreal- canadiens/former-hab-dollard-st-laurent-dies ==Career statistics== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

The Bowie County side of the lake is part of the Texarkana metropolitan area. ==Geography== Wright Patman Lake is located at . It is located on the border between Bowie County and Cass County, Texas, and the geographic center is about 18 miles (29 km) southwest of Texarkana, Texas and 148 miles (238 km) east of Dallas. Towns in the immediate vicinity of the lake include Redwater, Maud, and Douglassville, Texas. The lake is formed by water impounded by Wright Patman Dam. The water is mainly from the Sulphur River, but several smaller creeks also flow into the lake. The lake's conservation pool level is 220.6 feet (67.2 m) above sea level, and the spillway level is at 259.5 feet (79.1 m) above sea level. ==History== Wright Patman Lake and Dam were authorized as part of the United States' Flood Contract Act of 1946. Originally known as Texarkana Reservoir, the lake was later renamed to Lake Texarkana. Construction of the dam began in 1948, and the lake was formed when water was impounded in 1953. In 1973, the lake and dam were renamed in honor of Congressman Wright Patman of Texas. A government photo of the gates on the dam at Lake Texarkana during construction.

Other types of roofs and roof features include a gable dormer, a flat roof, pent roof, and shed roofs. Both primary and secondary roof surfaces are covered by galvanized sheet metal in a V-crimp pattern. The roof is pierced by two brick, corbelled chimneys on the north and west sides of the building, and an exterior brick chimney is located on the east side of the rear addition. At the time the house was built, the surrounding land was mostly orange groves and was sparsely populated. Although the property is named for Thomas Ayer, property records indicate the original owners of the house were actually L. J. and Lucy Parr, who bought the land from General Robert Bullock in 1885.

Magmatism is the emplacement of magma within and at the surface of the outer layers of a terrestrial planet, which solidifies as igneous rocks. It does so through magmatic activity or igneous activity, the production, intrusion and extrusion of magma or lava. Volcanism is the surface expression of magmatism. Magmatism is one of the main processes responsible for mountain formation. The nature of magmatism depends on the tectonic setting. For example, andesitic magmatism associated with the formation of island arcs at convergent plate boundaries or basaltic magmatism at mid-ocean ridges during sea-floor spreading at divergent plate boundaries. On Earth, magma forms by partial melting of silicate rocks either in the mantle, continental or oceanic crust. Evidence for magmatic activity is usually found in the form of igneous rocks – rocks that have formed from magma. ==Convergent boundaries== Magmatism is associated with all stages of the development of convergent plate boundaries, from the initiation of subduction through to continental collision and its immediate aftermath. ===Subduction-related=== The subduction of oceanic crust, whether beneath oceanic or continental crust, is associated in almost all cases with partial melting of the overlying asthenosphere due to the addition of volatiles (especially water) expelled from the downgoing slab. Only when the slab fails to reach sufficient depth as in the earliest stages of subduction or where there are periods of flat-slab subduction that completely pinch out the asthenosphere, is magmatism absent. The magmatism is mostly calc-alkaline in type along a well-defined curvilinear magmatic arc. Only the volcanic parts of modern arcs are exposed at the surface and the understanding of the underlying magma chambers relies on geophysical methods. Ancient arc sequences that formed on continental crust or that have become accreted to continental crust are often deeply eroded and the plutonic equivalents of the arc volcanoes become exposed. ===Collision-related=== Continental collisions are accompanied by major crustal thickening, leading to heating and anatexis within the crust, generally in the form of peraluminous granitic intrusions. ===Post- collision=== Post-collisional magmatism is a result of decompression melting associated with isostatic rebound and possible extensional collapse of the thickened crust formed during the collision. Slab detachment has also been proposed as a cause of late to post-collisional magmatism. ==Divergent boundaries== The new crust that is formed at divergent boundaries within oceanic crust is almost entirely magmatic in origin. ===Mid-ocean ridges=== Mid-ocean ridge spreading centres are the sites of almost continuous magmatism. The basalts erupted at mid-ocean ridges are tholeiitic in character and result from the partial melting of upwelling asthenosphere. The composition of Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalts (MORB) shows little variation globally as they come from a mostly homogeneous source. ===Back-arc basins=== Back-arc extension often leads to the formation of oceanic crust and relatively short- lived spreading centres. As the asthenosphere behind the arc has been partly affected by volatiles from the downgoing slab, the typical back-arc basin basalts are intermediate in character between MORB type basalts and IAB type basalts. ==Intraplate== Magmatic activity away from plate boundaries forms an important part of the magmatism on earth, including the largest magmatic events known, Large Igneous Provinces. ===Hotspots=== Hotspots are sites of upwelling of relatively hot mantle, possibly associated with mantle plumes, that cause partial melting of the asthenosphere. This type of magmatism forms volcanic seamounts or oceanic islands when they become emergent. Over short geological timescales the hotspots appear to be fixed relative to one another, forming a reference frame against which plate motions can be measured. As tectonic plates move relative to a hotspot, the location of magmatic activity on the plate shifts, causing the development of time-progressive chains of volcanoes such as the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. The main product of hotspot volcanoes are Ocean Island Basalts (OIB), which are distinct from MORB and IAB type basalts. Where hotspots are developed beneath the continents the products are different, as the mantle-derived magmas cause melting of the continental crust, forming granitic magmas that reach the surface as rhyolites. The Yellowstone hotspot is an example of continental hotspot magmatism, which also displays time-progressive shifts in magmatic activity. ===Rifts=== Many continental rift zones are associated with magmatism due to upwelling of the asthenosphere as the lithosphere is thinned, which leads to decompression melting. The magmatism is often bimodal in character as the mantle-derived basaltic magmas cause partial melting of the continental crust. ===Large Igneous Provinces=== Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) are defined as \\"mainly mafic (+ ultramafic) magmatic provinces with an areal extent >0.1 Mkm2 and igneous volume >0.1Mkm3, that have intraplate characteristics, and are emplaced in a short duration pulse or multiple pulses (less than 1–5 Ma) with a maximum duration of ==References== Category:Geological processes Category:Igneous rocks ","title":"Magmatism"},{"id":"6236857","text":"The Orange Springs Methodist Episcopal Church and Cemetery (also known as Orange Springs Community Church and Cemetery) is a historic church in Orange Springs, Florida.

The earliest stonework has been dated to 1160. It is a Norman motte and bailey castle. The castle's site is inside the old Saxon burh dominating the River Avon's lowest crossing. The Constable's House standing adjacent to the castle was added at around 1160 and is a rare and notable example of a Norman domestic dwelling.. Today the bailey is home to a bowling green and gardens, and the ditch has been filled but parts of the keep and much of the constable's house still stand. The site is managed by English Heritage. ==Castle== The keep and the mound on which it sits The castle is believed to stand on the site of an earlier wooden fort built in 924 following the capture of the town ramparts in 901 by King Aethelwold of Wessex and subsequently fortified with a motte by King Edward the Elder.. After the Norman conquest of 1066 the castle's defences were strengthened by the addition of a ditch and bailey surrounded by a wooden palisade. The wooden fort was eventually replaced with a stone keep. The Norman castle was a strategic defensive structure controlled by the King's constable until King Henry I () granted it as the caput of a feudal barony to his cousin Richard de Redvers (died 1107), feudal baron of Plympton, Devon.Sanders, Ian. English Baronies, Oxford, 1960, p.112, Probable Baronies, Christchurch While the Saxon defences had been against outside threats such as Viking raiders, the Norman fortress was more concerned with subduing the local populace. It was also a useful base for enforcing the New Forest Laws. The castle controlled the harbour and inland access via the Rivers Avon and Stour. The earliest masonry has been dated to , and there is documentary evidence of the castle existing in . Richard de Redvers is often named has the castle's first builder, although there is little documentary evidence of this and this castle may well have been on the site of the earlier Saxon castle. The castle was rebuilt by Baldwin de Redvers to resist King Stephen during the civil war with the Empress Matilda in 1147. A great tower was built probably around 1300. The castle again saw action during the Civil War of 1642–1651. The Parliamentarians were allowed to take control of the castle in 1644. The Royalists laid siege to it for 3 days, demolishing houses on the corner of Church Street and Castle Street in order to site their cannons. The Royalists were unable to take the castle and Oliver Cromwell, fearing such a powerful stronghold, ordered it to be slighted in 1652. The castle is now in ruins; a couple of the keep walls remain and the remains of a rectangular moat. ==Constable's House== Constable's House Nearby is a domestic Norman dwelling, known as the Constable's House, which was built within the original castle bailey in 1160. Much of the stonework survives, including a rare example of a Norman chimney (one of only five in the country). The stone used for construction was Purbeck marble. The ground floor which has four slit windows was used as a storeroom. The upper floor accessed by steps outside and an internal staircase contained the main hall. It is in size. As well as the chimney, another notable feature is the garderobe tower which extends over the mill stream added in the early 13thcentury to provide sanitary arrangements. ==Heritage status== Both the Castle and Constable's House are Grade I listed buildings. The area containing the adjacent priory, the castle and Constable's House is separately designated as a Scheduled Monument. ==See also== * Castles in Great Britain and Ireland * List of castles in England == References == * Fry, Plantagenet Somerset, The David & Charles Book of Castles, David & Charles, 1980. ==External links== *Read a detailed historical record about Christchurch Castle *English Heritage - Christchurch Castle Category:Castles in Dorset Category:English Heritage sites in Dorset Category:Buildings and structures in Christchurch, Dorset Category:Tourist attractions in Christchurch, Dorset Category:Ruins in Hampshire Category:Grade I listed buildings in Dorset Category:History of Christchurch, Dorset Category:Ruined castles in England Category:Grade I listed ruins ","title":"Christchurch Castle"},{"id":"6236870","text":"The Beggar-Laddie is a traditional English ballad existing in several variants.

Featured in the two-hour program were interactive games where the viewers can win cash prizes. The show aired around 12 a.m. - 2 a.m, in two separate feeds (Eastern and Pacific) Monday through Thursday (technically early Tuesday through Friday morning). ==Format== Midnight Money Madness was a game show where the contestants were home viewers. American residents over eighteen could enter the contest by text messaging a request, dialing a 1-900 number, or by using the online form. A person could enter up to ten times, regardless of entry method. The official rules detailing charges and entry are located at the show's website. Entries had an equal chance of selection, regardless of the means of entry. If selected, the registrant would be called and become a participant. Participants stayed on the line listening to a recorded message until they either proceeded into the next round of selection or dropped from the participant pool. One person from the final round of selection was chosen to be brought on-air for a question. The on-air contestant had the chance to play the game for cash. The program was produced by Endemol, more notable for their big-budget game shows and reality programs like Deal or No Deal, 1 vs. 100 and Big Brother. In July 2007, Endemol ventured into another participation TV program with Take the Cake. ===Games=== Midnight Money Madness featured various minigames which were played throughout the program. The rewards for the games were cash prizes ranging anywhere from $100 – $3,700 in cash. To speed up the games at certain points, various methods were employed: * Hints given by the hosts to viewers. * A \\"lightning round\\" where more calls are accepted than normal. * The host increasing the prize amount as an incentive. * A timer will start to represent how long the game will remain and a new one will come up. Some games, such as \\"What the Blank?\\" & \\"Things That Are...\\" relied heavily on sexual innuendos for comedy on the show, such as \\"Things that precede the word 'ass',\\" or \\"Things you prefer bigger.\\" The games below were the most commonly played games, but are not the only games played. Some games were purposely played only once, while others were titled differently but have similar gameplay. {  - !width=\\"150px\\"  Game !width=\\"500px\\"  Instructions - Find the Phrase A rebus or visual representation based on a popular, everyday phrase was given. (e.g., VA DERS would be Space Invaders, because there is a space in the word \\"Vaders\\".) The caller had to identify what the phrase was. - Four/Five Famous A certain category was given, with a group of people or items pre-selected that fit the category, each with a certain cash value. The contestant had to guess one of the items in that category. - Gargle-Oke The hosts would take a drink of water and attempt to gargle a famous song. The contestant had to identify the song.- - Impersonation Contestants had to guess what celebrity or fictional character a guest comedian was impersonating. - Let 'em Bounce Three sections of a word were on the screen. The contestant had to re-arrange the sections to form the proper word. - Linked Together Four words were written horizontally on the screen with one missing letter in each. The missing letters linked together vertically to form another word which the contestant had to guess, similar to a crossword. - Mumble Jumble Similar to an anagram, a word, name or phrase with the letters mixed up was given. The contestant had to identify what the unscrambled phrase was. - Nitty Griddy A 3x3 grid appeared with the three letters in a designated word located in various spots. The caller had to identify how many times the designated word appears in any pattern. - Order Up! Five images were given relating to a certain person (i.e. Images of the evolution of Michael Jackson's nose.) The contestant had to identify in what order of time the photos were taken. - Things That Are... A descriptive word was given to describe five pre-chosen items (each worth an increasing value). The contestant had to identify one of the five items to receive its dollar amount. - Tip the Scales A gathering of items was placed on the stage. The contestant had to identify which items, when combined, weighed a designated amount. - What the Blank? Similar to the Super Match on Match Game, a phrase with a blank was given. Callers gave the answer that they thought would fill the blank. If he/she picked one of the pre-chosen answers, he/she won its designated value. - Wheel Word Contestants had to spell a word around a circle by correctly filling in a blank letter and determining whether the word goes clockwise or counterclockwise around the circle. The hosts generally provided the first letter. - Which One Doesn't Belong? Four or five words or phrases were given, and callers had to decide which one was out of place in context with the rest. The winning caller did not, however, have to give the correct reason for why it doesn't belong. - Night Cap At the end of the program, a question pertaining to events prior in the show was given. The contestant had to answer that question correctly. If he/she did, one of the hosts would spin a wheel containing values between $200 and $2,500. Whatever value the flipper of the wheel landed on was awarded to the contestant. If not enough time remained to play a whole Nightcap game, the last contestant of the show would be awarded whatever value the wheel lands on. } ===The Midnight Money Madness Door=== Sometimes during a show, a doorbell for a door on the side of the stage rang and a celebrity, known from other various appearances and stints, would be present for the show. He/she would sometimes help out with clues or simply be there for comic material. Notable appearances include Phyllis Diller,Appeared on the August 29, 2006 episode. Jim J. Bullock,Appeared on the August 30, 2006 episode. Brigitte Nielsen,Appeared on the September 22, 2006 episode Barry Williams,Appeared on the September 12, 2006 episode. and Debra Wilson (parodying Whitney Houston).Appeared on the September 8, 2006 episode. ==Controversy== There had been many complaints of technical difficulties and unscrupulous behavior on part of the hosts, producers and creators of the show. Many on the TBS forums felt that it was necessary to report when the online entries were down (as show participation at that stage is considered gambling), while others feel that the show was simply bad due to technical problems. Two of the first three East Coast episodes were plagued with technical problems. For example, during the second episode the hosts spent the first ten minutes of the show elaborating on the entry methods. After that break, the viewers were told they are making sure their phones do not malfunction and to avoid dead air, TBS played an episode of Bloopers. The show went on normally approximately sixty minutes into the broadcast. The third East Coast episode, on August 30, had more problems. This time the problems were all off the air. The internet participation was stifled due to more technical difficulties on the part of TBS for the first forty-five minutes. Additionally, on one episode, a blooper happened, where after an on-home contestant named Greg tried to fill the one remaining blank that to complete \\"Wasting...\\" as \\"money\\", \\"water\\" and \\"energy\\" were revealed, and with forty seconds left, the board slipped off the main prop, and caused the one remaining answer to reveal prematurely, and that answer was \\"brain cells\\", and the guy did a pun saying \\"Wasting props!\\". The host and guy were to go to commercial. This clip was seen on one episode of Most Outrageous Moments. ==See also== * Quiz channel * PlayMania ==Notes and referencesrnal links == * * Category:2000s American game shows Category:2006 American television series debuts Category:2006 American television series endings Category:Phone-in quiz shows Category:Cable game shows Category:TBS (American TV channel) original programming Category:Television series by Endemol ","title":"Midnight Money Madness"},{"id":"6236918","text":"The Mount Zion A.M.E.

She was a Victory ship design type. Lanier was named for Lanier County, Georgia, which was named for poet Sidney Lanier. == World War II Service == Lanier was laid down 25 June 1944 by the California Shipbuilding Corporation, Wilmington, California, under a Maritime Commission contract. She was a VC2-S-AP5 Victory ship design type and her yard number was TR 8 and her hull number was MCV 39. She was launched 29 August 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Earl English; acquired by the Navy 22 December 1944; and commissioned the same day at Oakland, California, Comdr. Walter W. Rockey in command. After shakedown, Lanier departed San Francisco 23 February 1945 and arrived Pearl Harbor 2 March to practice landing operations. Loaded with 1,485 soldiers, she got underway 28 March and steamed in convoy with 11 other transports and five merchantmen for the Volcano Islands. Touching Eniwetok and Saipan, she reached Iwo Jima 20 April and discharged men and cargo. She returned to Saipan 22 to 24 April, took on board equipment and 1,442 troops, then sailed to Okinawa 2 to 6 May. There she landed reinforcements and embarked 66 battle casualties before returning to Saipan 8 to 13 May. On the next day she embarked 254 survivors from Little (DD-803), sunk by enemy air attack while on radar picket duty west of Okinawa 3 May. Steaming to San Francisco 14 to 30 May, Lanier proceeded to Seattle 31 May. The civilian harbor pilot entered the harbor too fast, turned to avoid a collision with a passenger ferry and ran between a barge and its tug. The collision sunk the barge, injured a civilian and sustained damage to the bow and forward ballast tanks. She was put in dry dock for repairs until 2 June, embarked 1,442 troops, and departed 12 June for the Far East. She sailed via Pearl Harbor, Eniwetok, and Ulithi and reached Okinawa 24 July. She operated off Okinawa until 6 August, then carried 798 passengers via Ulithi to Guam, where she arrived the 14th. She embarked over 1,300 occupation troops the following day and sailed as part of Task Force 31 for occupation landings on Japan. She anchored in Sagami Wan 27 August, and during midwatch 30 August entered Tokyo Bay to begin landing operations off Yokosuka. Her landing craft carried troops in the first wave and landed them at Yokosuka Airport at 0920. Steaming to Saipan 1 to 5 September, Lanier embarked marines of the 2d Division and carried them to Nagasaki, Kyūshū, 18 to 23 September. Sailing in convoy 26 September, Lanier reached Manila Bay, Luzon, 1 October and joined the “Magic Carpet” fleet. She proceeded to Saipan 16 to 21 October, embarked 1,851 homewardbound veterans, and departed the 22d for Seattle, Wash., where she arrived 4 November. On 28 November she departed once more for the southwest Pacific. Reaching New Guinea 17 December, she embarked 1,598 troops at Hollandia, 532 troops at Finschhafen, and departed 21 December for the west coast. She arrived San Pedro 6 January 1946. Lanier sailed for the east coast 19 January 1946, and reached Norfolk 4 February. She decommissioned at Norfolk 5 March 1946 and was turned over to the War Shipping Administration 8 March. She was placed in the James River Reserve Fleet (JRRF). == Fate == In 1956 Lanier was withdrawn from the Reserve Fleet as part of a Repair Program, GAA-American Hawaiian, and then returned.

It is thought to have been originally built around 1370 for William Latimer, the sheriff of Somerset and Dorset, after the manor passed to him in 1355. The house is now owned by English Heritage and open for the public to visit throughout the year; however, there is an adjoining building to the north that continues to serve as a private residence and is not open to the public. The present day site—set in a T-shape—comprises a two-storey solar and half of the hall to the east of that, both with open timber roofs; the foundations of the west range and an extension of the hall are now visible only as earthworks. The house is unusual among its class of building in retaining many of its original features; this despite having undergone many alterations during its 600-year history. It has been described as having \\"perhaps the most spectacular manor house interior in Dorset.\\" In the sixteenth century the solar wing was extended to the north and the hall remodeled by architect Thomas White and his wife Anne; the house remained in the White family until at least the time of Charles I. After the Restoration, it was bought by Sir Thomas Freke and retained by his descendants, the Pitt-Rivers family; they reduced the length of the hall by , it having previously extended almost to the River Stour, and added a new fireplace and ceiling. By 1956, however, the 18th-century building had been demolished and the original, 14th-century part was derelict; by 1962, only the northern wing remained habitable, and the original section passed into state ownership. The house underwent restoration during the 1970s by the Department for the Environment—now the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). ==References *Fiddleford Manor, English Heritage page Category:Country houses in Dorset Category:English Heritage sites in Dorset Category:Historic house museums in Dorset ","title":"Fiddleford Manor"},{"id":"6236992","text":"The Delta Police Department (DPD) is the police force for the City of Delta, British Columbia, a suburban community in Metro Vancouver with a population of 102,661. As of 2019, the Delta Police Department has an authorized strength of 194 sworn members and 72 civilian support staff, and an operating budget of $35,981,000. In 2007, Delta Police Department (DPD) became responsible for policing the Tsawwassen First Nation through an agreement between the nation and the provincial and federal government. Under the Tsawwassen First Nation Final Agreement Act, the first nation does not have the power to establish a police force on their own, but are able to do so by requesting the minister of public safety and solicitor general. The nation chose to employ the DPD in enforcing its laws.Tsawwassen First Nation Final Agreement Act In 2020, Delta Police Department was recognized as one of BC's Top Employers 2020. Delta is one of the safest cities in the Metro Vancouver area, according to Statistics Canada Data The Crime Severity Index in Delta is just under 53 index points, as per the latest statistics from 2018. It continues to be significantly lower than Metro Vancouver (75.6), B.C. (88.3) and Canada (75). The Crime Severity Index not only measures the amount of crime, but also the seriousness of each offense. The crime severity index in Delta has been declining steadily since 2014 according to Statistics Canada. Property crime in Delta trended downward in 2019, a decline of two per cent overall. Residential break and enter was down 20 per cent compared to the three-year average and theft from vehicle was down 15 per cent. The only real outlier was theft over/under $5,000, which was up 14 per cent compared to the three-year average. ==History== The history of the Delta Police Department is closely tied to the first organized policing presence in British Columbia's history. In 1858, Governor James Douglas appointed William Ladner as the first constable of New Caledonia. Ladner later went on to found the community of Ladner's Landing, which became the hub of the Municipality of Delta, British Columbia, on November 10, 1879. On August 20, 1887, William McKee, the municipal clerk, was designated as a constable in addition to his duties as a clerk. On July 7, 1888, Joseph Jordan was appointed as Delta's first full-time constable, and with this appointment the Delta Municipal Police Department was formed. Over the next eight years Jordan was dismissed and re-appointed several times, depending on the department's needs and was assisted on occasion by other temporary constables. By 1900, Jordan had been designated as the chief constable and worked full-time in this role until his retirement in 1911. The chief constable's position remained the only regular full-time or part-time position until 1931, when the municipal council authorized the appointment of a night policeman. It was the duty of this policeman, whose salary was partly paid for by the local merchants, to patrol the streets of Ladner at night. The 1950s was a decade of growth for the DPD as membership increased to 11 police officers, and the police station began operating on a 24-hour-a-day basis. By 1971, the police department had grown to 45 police officers, due to the growth in community population after the opening of the George Massey Tunnel. ==Public Confidence== Public confidence in Delta Police is high, according to the results of a public survey, released by police in March, 2019. Residents are confident in the Delta Police Department’s ability to deliver urgent services, but want officers to be more visible in the community. Respondents thought the DPD did well in delivering urgent services in a timely manner; dealing with violent crime; having clear and transparent communication through strong social media programs; and consulting with the community to ensure the DPD is meeting their needs and expectations. Seventy-four per cent of residents give a good to very good rating of officers they had contact with, and 80 per cent of people feel the Delta Police do a good to very good job of delivering urgent services in a timely manner, well above the Canadian average. == Recent High Profile Investigations  Brother’s Keeper gang arrests === In February 2019, the DPD arrested three people associated with the Brother’s Keepers gang, seizing weapons and “a significant quantity of drugs.” The DPD, with the RCMP’s emergency response team and members of the Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit’s uniformed gang enforcement team, executed a search warrant at a Surrey residence that had been the target of a drug trafficking investigation involving the Brother’s Keepers. Police found a loaded firearm, a replica restricted firearm and two bullet proof vests, as well as a significant quantity of suspected heroin and cocaine packaged for sale and a suspected bulk quantity of fentanyl. Three people inside the residence — two women and a man — were arrested without incident and later released, pending charge approval by Crown Counsel. “To infiltrate a gang is pretty great work by our drug detectives,” Delta Police Chief Dubord said, noting the arrests highlight the inherent dangers and violence associated with drug trafficking. === Attack on Acting Sergeant John Jasmins === In February 2019, Delta resident Manoj George was arrested after allegedly attacking a woman outside Immaculate Conception School in North Delta. Acting Sgt. John Jasmins, who was picking up his children from school, instructed his children to call 9-1-1 and intervened in the assault, tackling the man and receiving several stab wounds to the abdomen in the process. The woman was also stabbed several times. “Investigators believe that if John hadn’t acted so quickly, the woman involved in this incident could have lost her life. He is a hero,” said Delta Police Chief Dubord. In September 2019, Acting Sgt. Jasmins was awarded a Chief Constable Commendation, the DPD’s highest level of recognition, for “his act of exceptional courage exhibited while risking his personal safety,” and in November 2019 he was presented with the Award of Valour, B.C.’s highest police honour. === Project Screaming Eagle === Delta Police arrested eight people and seized drugs, cash and a vehicle as a result of a two-month investigation into street sales of crystal methamphetamine. “Our investigators recovered suspected crystal methamphetamine, cash, and evidence associated to drug trafficking at the scene,” DPD public affairs manager Cris Leykauf said in a press release. “While officers were on scene a nearby business owner came over and thanked them for their efforts, noting the residence has been problematic.” The investigation — dubbed Project Screaming Eagle — began when officers with DPD’s patrol support team doing proactive patrols in the area “noticed a trend of activity consistent with drug trafficking.\\" == Officer Wellness – Bend Don’t Break == In late 2018, the department launched a podcast called Bend, Don’t Break, which shares the stories of first responders who have overcome significant adversity in their personal and professional lives. The idea came from Const. Aaron Hill, who spoke at length in the first episode about facing an allegation of excessive force at the same time as being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. \\"They called me and said I was being investigated for deceit… I was really concerned about what my peers would think of me,\\" Hill recalled in an interview with CTV News. Const. Jordan MacWilliams is also featured in the podcast. MacWilliams was among dozens of officers called to the Starlight Casino in New Westminster for reports of a distressed man armed with a gun who had taken his ex-girlfriend hostage. In the podcast, MacWilliams describes step-by-step the actions he says officers took during that standoff, from rescuing the victim to attempts at negotiation. Listeners to the podcast have given it 5/5 stars. Access to the podcast is also available on Google Play and at https://deltapolice.ca/podcast/ ==On Duty Deaths== On November 2, 1974, Staff Sergeant Ron McKay was shot and killed by Elery Long. This incident occurred when McKay attended Long's residence to speak to him regarding a confrontation that occurred earlier in the day at a local gas station. On May 27, 1975 Long was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On July 14, 1976, Long's death sentence, along with the death sentences of ten other people convicted of murdering peace officers, were converted to life sentences. In 2002 Long was granted full parole which has since been revoked following repeated contacts with police. On April 8, 2000, Constable Mark Nieuwenhuis was killed in a police motorcycle accident. The investigation revealed that Nieuwenhuis was attempting to stop a vehicle at the time of the accident. A suspect has never been officially named. ==See also== * Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit of British Columbia * E-Comm, 9-1-1 call and dispatch centre for Southwestern BC ==References * Delta Police Department Category:Law enforcement agencies of British Columbia Category:Politics of Delta, British Columbia ","title":"Delta Police Department"},{"id":"6236994","text":"Dick's Picks Volume 6 is the sixth live album in the Dick's Picks series of releases by the Grateful Dead.

The seaplane base had been set up prior to the Battle of Coral Sea and became untenable and was abandoned by the Japanese, due to proximity to Allied airfields at Port Moresby and the failure of Mo Sakusen (Operation Mo). == Deboyne atoll installations == Deboyne is the name for both an island and the atoll of which it is a part. Deboyne Island is also known as Panniet Island. It is in the Louisiade Archipelago east of Papua New Guinea. During World War II, the Japanese built a temporary seaplane base in the lagoon at Deboyne Atoll as part of MO Sakusen, the attempt to capture Port Moresby, Papua. The base was created by units that came from Rabaul, New Britain and Shortland Island in the Solomon Islands, including the seaplane tender Kamikawa Maru. The base existed for approximately five-and-a-half days in May 1942, including the Battle of the Coral Sea. During that time the Japanese Navy operated a small number of Aichi E13A (Jake), Mitsubishi F1M (Pete), Nakajima E8N (Dave) and possibly other types of seaplanes there. Fortifications were minimal, consisting of felled palm trees and small-caliber anti-aircraft guns on shore, as well as any firepower on ships in the lagoon.Diary of seaplane tender Kamikawa MaruDiary of Air Unit of Kiyokawa Maru == Operations at Deboyne == Two Australian planes made contact with the Japanese seaplane base force as it was approaching the Deboyne atoll on May 6, 1942 to set up the base. Lockheed Hudson bomber A16-160 escaped, but Catalina A24-20 was shot down by three Japanese seaplanes in the vicinity of Misima Island. An Australian Hudson carried out a bombing raid early on May 7. The light aircraft carrier Shôhô was sunk later on May 7, 1942 by American carrier-based airplanes north and east of Deboyne. At least two fighter planes from Shôhô ditched at Deboyne. In addition, one Japanese land-based bomber made an emergency landing in the lagoon on May 7 following its attack on Royal Australian Navy Rear Admiral Crace's task force, which was to the south of Deboyne. Japanese seaplanes flew in and out of the Deboyne base during the Coral Sea battle on reconnaissance and search-and-rescue missions. They particularly concentrated their searches to the south, where American aircraft carriers were expected. On May 8, a fighter plane from aircraft carrier Zuikaku made an emergency landing in the lagoon. American Army bombers from Port Moresby attacked the seaplane base on May 9, 10 and 11, suffering the loss of one B-25 and one B-26. The Japanese left Deboyne during May 10–12, 1942 and did not return during World War II. The base became untenable for the Japanese due to proximity to Allied airfields at Port Moresby and the failure of MO Sakusen. == References == Category:South West Pacific theatre of World War II Category:Conflicts in 1942 Category:1942 in Papua New Guinea Category:Battles and operations of World War II involving Papua New Guinea Category:Papua New Guinea in World War II Category:World War II aerial operations and battles of the Pacific theatre ","title":"Raids on Deboyne (1942)"},{"id":"6237011","text":"Gordon Kirby (born in Brighton, England) is a Canadian auto racing journalist.

It occupies the lower floors of the former Federal Building and Post Office at 555 Columbia Street, at the corner of 6th Street. The force has around one hundred members; Dave Jansen has been Chief Constable since June 2020. ==History== The force was created in 1873 when the city council hired as its first constable Jonathan Morey, a former sergeant with the Royal Engineers, Columbia detachment, who stayed behind after the detachment was disbanded in 1863. Other residents were temporarily deputized when needed; by the 1880s, as the number of constables increased, badges and uniforms were introduced and patrol routes and a budget instituted; the budget was reduced after a fire destroyed much of the city in 1898. From 1901 to 2001, except for a period in 1970 during renovations, the New Westminster Police Department was at the New Westminster City Hall. It was professionalized in the early 20th century and reorganized during the 1920s, when it also adopted the then new system of single fingerprint identification and was the first Canadian police department to use a modus operandi system. In 1977 the department established a Community Services Division, one of the earliest in British Columbia; in 1991 it opened a Community Police Office in the former Canadian Pacific Railway station. In 2001 the department moved to its own building and opened the New Westminster Police Museum, including materials assembled by the former New Westminster Police Historical Society and by Detective Constable D.E.A. \\"Ted\\" Usher, who published a book on the history of the department in 2000. ===Editing of Wikipedia article=== In September 2019, a Wikipedia user account operated by a member of the department's communications team was blocked after attempting to scrub the department's Wikipedia article of information about two officers (one employed by NWPD) convicted of assaulting and robbing a newspaper deliveryman (and making racist comments in the process) in Vancouver in 2009. ==See also== * Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit of British Columbia * E-Comm, 9-1-1 call and dispatch centre for southwestern BC ==References * New Westminster Police Department Category:New Westminster Category:Law enforcement agencies of British Columbia ","title":"New Westminster Police Department"},{"id":"6237048","text":"Wilbur Maurice Harris (born February 21, 1976), nicknamed \\"Sugar Moe\\", is the former United States Boxing Association heavyweight champion.

In 1997 he lost a disputed split decision to former champion Larry Holmes. He followed the Holmes bout with a seven fight winning streak in 1998-99. This included defeating former number one heavyweight contender Jeremy Williams, and culminated in a fight on HBO with Derrick Jefferson. In what was labeled as the 1999 Ring Magazine knockout of the year, Harris was brutally knocked out by a vicious left hook. In 1998 Harris was the chief sparring partner for heavyweight world champion Lennox Lewis and maintained this position for several years. In 2002, Harris knocked out future heavyweight champion 19-0 Siarhei Liakhovich in the 9th round. Later that year, Harris won the Thunderbox Heavyweight Tournament \\"Fistful of Dollars\\" in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The round-robin exhibition event consisted of eight heavyweights doing battle in three, three-minute rounds. Harris outpointed Gerald Nobles, future number one contender Tony Thompson and Israel Garcia in the same evening to win the $100,000 purse. ===Comeback=== After a three-year layoff, Harris made a comeback in 2010 in the heavyweight division. Under the guidance of promoter Mario Yagobi of Boxing360, Harris returned to the ring. Harris won the vacant United States Boxing Association heavyweight title in his second opportunity with a 12-round unanimous decision over Nagy Aguilera at the Grand Casino in Hinckley, Minnesota. However, on May 27, 2011, Harris lost an eliminator bout for the IBF # 2 position at Reno Events Center in Reno, Nevada. On July 16, 2011, Harris defended his USBA heavyweight title in Atlantic City, New Jersey on July 16, 2011, with a 12th-round knockout over challenger Derric Rossy. ==Professional boxing record== { style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\\" -

She was a member of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, located in east-central Minnesota. ==Early life== She was born as Maude Ellen Mitchell in a bark wigwam during the Manoominike-giizis (or \\"Ricing Moon\\"), which occurs in August, in 1904 in Crow Wing County, Minnesota near Portage Lake, a few miles northwest of Mille Lacs Lake. Her parents were Charles Mitchell, a member of the non-Removable Mille Lacs Indians of the Adik-doodem, and his wife, Nancy Pine. Maude was named after her maternal uncle Gichi-Mizko- giizhig, otherwise known as George Pine. As a child she lived with her aunts Mary and Sara Pine, her father, her grandmother and her grandmother's brother, and her uncle and his wife. Due to the death of her mother in childbirth, Maude Mitchell was raised by her maternal grandmother, Margaret Pine, (also known in Ojibwe as Aakogwan). She learned English from her aunts and white neighbors at an early age. During the winter her family would live in a house, but otherwise followed the traditional seasonal cycle of the Minnesota Anishinaabeg. In the spring they would move to iskigamiziganing, or the sugar bush. In summer they set camp by the wild rice fields. They travelled by foot, horse, or birch bark canoes. Kegg chose her own birthdate as August 26 since the exact date of her birth was not known. She finished eighth grade at the local county Esdon school, and was the only Native child to attend the school. She met farm worker Martin Kegg at a Midewiwin ceremony in 1917. They married in 1920 in a traditional Indian manner, and again in 1922 in a church ceremony. They moved in 1942 to Shah-bush-kung Point on Mille Lacs with their children, and again in 1960 to a point more inland. Martin Kegg died in 1968. Together they had eleven children. ==Career== In 1968 Kegg began working as a guide at the Trading Post and Museum, which is now part of the Minnesota Historical Society. Kegg herself was not a writer but rather dictated her stories to others, notably John D. Nichols, who transcribed the stories into both English and Ojibwe. In \\"Portage Lake\\" Kegg relates her memories from her childhood working with her female relatives. She preserved many traditions of the Ojibwe from agricultural techniques, such as how to harvest and process wild rice of the northern lake area and maple sugaring. She was one of the last masters of the Ojibwe language and contributed special Ojibwe terms and language data to linguists, especially in the form of the Concise Dictionary of Minnesota Ojibwe, published in 1995. Kegg worked for the Minnesota Historical Society at Mille Lacs for many years. She acted as a docent and tour guide, and helped create a large diorama of Ojibwe seasonal life, making every artifact in the exhibit. She was exceptionally skilled in beadwork, and was a master of Ojibwe floral designs and geometric loom beadwork techniques. She was able to create fully beaded traditional bandolier bags, which were commonly worn by tribal leaders. She has shown pieces in the Smithsonian Institution's craft collection. The American Federation of Arts touring exhibition \\"Lost and Found: Native American Art, 1965-1985.\\" showcased one of her beaded bandoliers. ==Awards and honors== *Minnesota Governor Rudy Perpich honored her by declaring August 26, 1986 as \\"Maude Kegg Day\\" for the State of Minnesota. *In 1990, she was awarded a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in recognition of her effort to preserve Ojibwe language, traditions, stories, culture, and crafts. ==Death== She died on January 6, 1996 at age 91. ==Bibliography== *Gabekanaansing = At the end of the trail: memories of Chippewa childhood in Minnesota with texts in Ojibwe and English.

Leslie has produced singles for a number of prominent artists in a variety of genres, ranging from R&B; and hip hop to pop and gospel. From 2005–2006, he had his most commercial success to date with NextSelection/Bad Boy singer Cassie, when they released her debut single, \\"Me & U\\". Leslie's 2008 self-titled debut album, includes the singles \\"Diamond Girl\\", \\"Addiction\\" and \\"How It Was Supposed to Be\\". Leslie, who is a singer, songwriter, rapper and entrepreneur, as well as a Harvard University graduate, is also the founder and CEO of SuperPhone and NextSelection Lifestyle Group. In 2011, he was nominated for a Grammy. ==Early life== His parents are Salvation Army officers, who frequently relocate for work. Ryan's family are avid practicing Christians. Ryan has lived in various states, cities, and countries. At an early age, Leslie taught himself how to play the piano. He developed the ability to recite music, as well as arrange chords to create songs. At the age of 14, Leslie scored a 1600 on his SATs—a perfect score—while attending Bear Creek High School, in Stockton, California. In 1993, he applied to four University of California campuses as well as Stanford, Yale and Harvard. In his application essays he explained his interest in matriculating from his junior year in high school without having earned a diploma. He was accepted to all except for Stanford. He ultimately decided to attend Harvard College. At the age of 19, Leslie graduated from Harvard with a degree in Government, concentrating in Political Science and Macroeconomics. During the undergraduate Class Day ceremonies, Leslie was selected to be the Harvard Male Orator, one of four seniors who deliver orations to the graduating senior class. Leslie grew up around music, playing cornet as a child in the Salvation Army band. Ryan later switched to piano because his overbite made it difficult to get proper embouchure on a brass instrument. At Harvard, he joined the Krokodiloes, an a cappella group. Leslie suddenly saw a new future for himself when a friend played him a Stevie Wonder CD freshman year. “I became obsessed with him,” says Leslie. “I wanted to chase that man's career.” Leslie became a constant presence at the on-campus recording studio. Fellow student Chiqui Matthew, now working for Goldman Sachs, remembered Leslie making beats at every free moment: “He was on a different level of intensity. Most of us were pretty realistic — we're Harvard students; this music stuff is fun, but this isn't the future. But Ryan always had a ten-year plan about how he was going to take over the music industry.” While still a college student, Leslie began producing tracks for local Boston artists, and molding his image, which Matthew found unconvincing: “He had this pseudo-sexual, thugged-out Lothario thing. I never really bought it. He seemed more like a music nerd to me\\". ==Music career1997-2003: Career beginnings=== During his freshman year at Harvard, Leslie devoted many hours per week to creating and developing music in a studio basement on campus. He taught himself basic production skills and also developed a musical style of his own. As the semesters progressed, Leslie spent more and more time in the school's studio molding his craft. He also performed many events around campus and was a part of the school's all male a cappella group The Krokodiloes. Due to the conflict with music and school, Leslie was put on academic probation three times during his college career. He has said in many interviews that during those college years, he became accustomed to getting 2 to 3 hours of sleep per night. To earn disposable income during these years, Leslie sold instrumentals to local artists in the Boston area. After graduating college, Leslie urged his parents to allow him to go into the music industry. They told him that he could have a better future considering he graduated from college at the age of 19. Leslie insisted that he was going to pursue his musical interests for two years and if he didn't like it he would stop. Leslie remained in Boston because of its music scene. He took on community service jobs to help support himself and would spend nights in the recording studio working on his music. Eventually, Leslie moved back home with his parents in Phoenix where he convinced them to take out a loan for a production studio so that he could pursue music full-time. He vowed to his family that he would pay back the $15,000 loan one day, even if it meant going back to school and getting a more traditional job. For the next several months, Leslie worked towards developing a distinct sound. During this period, Leslie has said that he ate and slept very little. In the summer of 2003, Ryan landed a production internship with producer Younglord. He has said in interviews that he considers this 30-day internship the jump-start of his career in the music industry. Within the first week, Leslie produced the song “Keep Giving Your Love To Me” that would later be performed by Beyoncé for the Bad Boys II soundtrack. The soundtrack was supervised by Sean “Diddy” Combs, who was impressed by Leslie's production style and offered him a management contract upon meeting him. Under the management of Combs, Leslie worked on various Bad Boy Records projects, including releases from Loon, Cheri Dennis, B5, New Edition and Danity Kane. During that time, Leslie co-produced a record for Britney Spears. Also in 2003, Leslie was introduced by his then attorney Ed Woods to Tommy Mottola. Mottola soon became a mentor of Leslie's and offered him a publishing deal with Aspen Songs and a recording contract with Casablanca, Mottola's imprint distributed by Universal Music Group. Under the mentorship of Mottola and Combs, Leslie signed then-aspiring model Cassie Ventura to his imprint, NextSelection in 2005. In late 2003, Leslie began recording his debut album, entitled Just Right, and released two singles: \\"The Way That U Move Girl\\" and \\"Used 2 Be\\" (with Fabolous). The album was never officially released due to creative differences between Leslie and his record label. Ryan Leslie performing at the B.U.M.P. Music Festival in Boston in 2010. ===2004-2010: Debut album, Transition and leaving label=== Ryan Leslie returned to the studio in 2006 to record a new debut album. The lead single, \\"Diamond Girl\\" was released in December 2007. The video for \\"Diamond Girl\\" was premiered on BET's 106 & Park, and released on Leslie's YouTube channel with a special behind-the-scenes clip. In November 2007, he released a video for a song named \\"I-R-I-N-A\\" that was produced in-house and released through his YouTube channel as well. His second single, \\"Addiction\\" features pop singer and protege Cassie, with a rap cameo from long-time collaborator, rapper Fabolous. The song was officially released in August 2008. Of the two music videos made for the song, the \\"Making of 'Addiction'\\" clip became Leslie's most popular video on YouTube, with more than 3.2 million views. His third single, \\"How It Was Supposed To Be\\" also has two music videos: a rock version and a military take on the song, which was Leslie's directorial debut and was co-directed by model Tyson Beckford. The single was released March 23, 2009. After many setbacks, his self-titled album, Ryan Leslie, was finally released on February 10, 2009. Leslie wrote, arranged, produced, and performed every song on his album. Notable instrumentalists on his debut set include Tommy Mottola, Tom \\"T-Bone\\" Wolk, and Brent Paschke. Ryan Leslie enamored old and new fans alike (June 23) during the first of two back-to-back performances at New York City's Bowery Ballroom. The R&B; singer/rapper/songwriter/producer/multi-instrumentalist (who parted ways with former label Universal Motown mid-2010) celebrated his new-found independence with performances of former hits like \\"Addicted\\" and \\"How It Was Supposed to Be,\\" as well as two new tracks: \\"Glory\\" and \\"Maybachs and Diamonds.\\" \\"Never had a top ten, but they still respect my art,\\" Ryan Leslie sang during \\"Glory,\\" which is slated to be included on his third release, \\"Les Is More\\"—his first independent album following 2009's self-titled debut and \\"Transition.\\" \\"Maybachs and Diamonds\\" is a slow, groovy tune about flourishing his partner with more than just material things, like \\"Maybachs and Diamonds.\\" Initially, Leslie had a four-album deal with Universal, but toward the end of that contract, \\"Universal was interested in reshaping my deal to more of a 360, and they actually made a counter-offer from the initial recording fund,\\" Leslie tells Billboard.com. \\"At that point I saw that as a window to potentially branch off and try something that was going to be new and dynamic.\\" While Leslie did not make any formal announcements about his departure from Universal Motown during the set, he took some subtle jabs at his previous label home. \\"I've always wanted to play these songs but I couldn't before,\\" he said while singing \\"Guardian Angel.\\" \\"I always felt like this song should be a single. Ryan Leslie performing at the Manifesto 8th Year (2014) in Toronto. ===2011-present: Les Is More and Black Mozart=== Ryan Leslie announced on Twitter and Facebook in January 2011, that his third album would be released July 4th, 2011. His first official single from the album released was 'Glory', despite the first singles performed being 'Beautiful Lie' and 'Breathe'. However Leslie would later announce on his website and Twitter account that the album has now been pushed back for a release 'This Fall'. On October 11th, he sent an e-mail to his fanbase saying \\"I promise 'Les Is More' is just a few weeks away.\\" Les is More is now a visual album. So far \\"Glory\\", \\"Beautiful Lie\\", \\"Good Girl\\" and \\"5 Minute Freshen Up\\" are out on his website. The latter was released on March 20, 2012. \\"Dress You To Undress You\\" and \\"Swiss Francs\\" are still scheduled for release. Other Tracks Mentioned to be on the album by Leslie via his official Twitter are \\"Ready or Not\\" and \\" Live Good (Riviera Flow) Feat. Raekwon\\". Leslie has performed the tracks \\"Breathe (Feat. Mr Hudson) and \\"One Lonely Heart\\" live and said they would be included on Les is More. \\"Joan Of Arc\\" was released in mid-2011 and Leslie stated at that time that it would be included on Les is More. Ryan Leslie announced the date for his album Les Is More via Twitter. The album was released on October 22, 2012. Ryan announced in February 2013 that his fourth studio album Black Mozart would be released 16 April 2013 however delayed the release. The full album was released to members of Leslie's #Renegades club on August 31, 2013. ==Other venturesNextSelection Lifestyle Group=== While working as a producer, Leslie went on to create NextSelection Lifestyle Group, his music-media company he founded with online marketing partner Rasheed Richmond. Ryan signed his first artist, Cassie in 2005. Under Ryan's guidance, Cassie went on to become one of the fastest rising R&B; acts that year. Her breakout smash \\"Me & U\\" (written and produced by Leslie) spent 20 weeks on the Top 40 and went on to reach number three on the Billboard Hot 100, selling over a million digital units. \\"Me & U\\" also went on to become one of the biggest records in the history of Atlantic Records. Ryan posts an interactive daily video blog, where he gives viewers a taste of what daily life is like in the music business. \\"Blogging is something that allows us to document life,\\" Leslie said. \\"When you look at a lot of successful films, books, a lot of them relate to the experiences of others,\\" and the video blog is a way for him to connect with the masses. \\"There have been other video blogs, but this one's a first of its kind from a music standpoint,\\" he said \\"It's a huge commitment,\\" he said of the video blog. \\"It takes six, seven hours a day to produce a video blog.\\" In anticipation for the release of Les Is More, Leslie releases a new music video from his album for every video that reaches one million hits on his website ryanleslie.com. Recently, Ryan signed Krys Ivory as his newest act under NextSelection. He also signed YouTube star Mia Rose. ===SuperPhone=== In August 2013, Leslie released his fourth studio album, Black Mozart, through his #Renegades music club. In subsequent months, musicians such as 50 Cent, Raphael Saadiq, and Talib Kweli would use the underlying technology to launch their respective upcoming studio albums and power their own music membership clubs. Kweli spoke about the experience in an interview, “The first thing that appeals to me is the direct contact with the fans and the fact that I receive their e-mails...The second thing is the fact that the money comes directly to me when you buy the album from me. It goes directly to my account. There is nobody taking their cut.” Leslie's work with SuperPhone has been supported by venture capitalists such as Ben Horowitz, journalists such as TechCrunch's Josh Constine, and musicians such as Kanye West. ==ArtistryMusical influences=== Leslie has stated that Stevie Wonder is one of the biggest influences on his music. He attributes Michael Jackson, Prince, Jimi Hendrix, James Brown, Quincy Jones, The Beatles, and D'Angelo as musical heroes as well. ===Online presence=== Leslie's blog, YouTube channel, MySpace page and most recently Twitter have been the biggest contributors to his growing fanbase. His videos have become some of the most popular on YouTube, bringing accolades such as \\"Top 10 Most Subscribed Users\\". Leslie also posts videos documenting his interaction with his audience, including giving away free iPods, backstage passes to his concerts, and invitations to have dinner with him. His energy and creative spontaneity have earned him the respect from those inside and outside of the music industry. On his website/video diary, there is a clip featuring artists such as Boyz II Men, Chrisette Michelle, Musiq Soulchild, Keri Hilson, Christina Milian, and David Banner praising him for the inspiration they have received from his videos. Leslie maintains such an active online presence as he believes that it is the future of the music industry. He says that due to the digital music revolution of the past few years, physical compact discs of music will eventually become obsolete, and will become the eight track tape of this generation. Prior to his 2009 MySpace Release concert, Leslie encouraged aspiring musical artists to utilize digital media while marketing themselves. ==Personal life== Producer Ryan Leslie began spotting Cassie Ventura at clubs and parties in late 2004. He was charmed by Cassie's personality and was finally introduced to her by AJ Crimson, Sean \\"Diddy\\" Combs' makeup artist, who had worked with Cassie on one of her photo modeling shoots. Not long afterward, Cassie approached Ryan Leslie to help her record a song that she wanted to give to her mother as a birthday gift. Leslie put together a duet for the two of them to sing, called \\"Kiss Me\\". He was so pleased with the result that he played it for record executive Tommy Mottola who quickly offered Cassie a management deal. Leslie soon signed Cassie to his NextSelection label, and wrote and produced Cassie's first single, \\"Me & U\\" in 2005. Leslie was named one of \\"New York's 50 Hottest Bachelors\\" in 2009 by PageSix Magazine, published by the New York Post. ===Legal issues=== In October 2010, Leslie's laptop was stolen from his Mercedes, while he was on tour in Cologne, Germany. Leslie would offer $20,000, raising it to $1 million reward for the return of it due to his recent productions that it contained. The laptop was returned however the intellectual property that Leslie was trying to recover was not present, and Leslie did not feel the reward terms had been met. Armin Augstein, who runs a garage in Pulheim, near Cologne, who returned the laptop was granted the $1 million reward in 2012 after a lawsuit. He was later also made pay an extra $180,000 in interest for refusing to pay for those two years. Leslie is still in search for the material that was missing. On September 7, 2013, New York City marshals seized Leslie's 2010 Cadillac Escalade, which went up for auction two days later on September 9 due to him continuing to not pay up the reward he offered for the laptop. It was also revealed Leslie had apparently only paid 5,000 dollars so far, even though court documents indicate Leslie's performances make hundreds of thousands of dollars. ==Discography== *Just Right (2005) *Ryan Leslie (2008) *Transition (2009) *Les Is More (2012) *Black Mozart (2013) *MZRT (2015) *MZRT Lifetime Album (2018) *Fleurier Flows (EP) (2019) ==Awards and nominations== *BET Awards **2009, Best Male R&B; Artist [Nominated] **2009, Best New Artist [Nominated] *Grammy Awards **2011, Best Contemporary R&B; Album: Transition (Nominated) *Soul Train Music Awards **2009, Best R&B;/Soul or Rap New Artist [Nominated] *Academic Awards **2010, AMBLE Vanguard Award from Harvard University ==References== Know how to stay away from tension ==External links== * *French Interview for SoulRnB.com *Ryan Leslie on Soulrnb.com French Artist Page * Rapper ordered to pay the $1M reward he promised for recovery of stolen laptop NEW YORK POST November 29, 2012, article on Ryan Leslie's court case ruling for unpaid finders fee. * Burned up: Rapper Leslie torches Post front page for covering his attempt to weasel out of a $1M reward NEW YORK POST December 1, 2012, on Leslie's public rap in response to fans about the court ruling made against him for the unpaid recovery reward of his stolen laptop, whereby he challenges the verdict based on that the data was no longer intact. * * * Category:Living people Category:1978 births Category:Singers from Washington, D.C.

He used his unmarked police vehicle to block it in to prevent it from fleeing while he waited for marked police units for cover. Tabesh and one other occupant exited the vehicle. The officer identified himself as police and shouted for the men to not move. Rather than fleeing from him or dropping prone, both males ran towards the officer, Tabesh holding what the officer perceived to be a wood-handled weapon of an unknown type. The officer fired at the pair, killing Tabesh. It was determined post- mortem that Tabesh had a blood alcohol content of .07, or \\"mild to moderate physical intoxication\\". At the coroner's inquest, it was found that Tabesh had major depression with psychotic features, and had been prescribed medication which he had stopped taking just prior to the incident. The five-person jury panel at the inquest found the act to be a homicide, meaning that it was caused by another person rather than natural causes or an accident, without the implication of criminal responsibility.Jury calls teenager's death a homicide The mayor and chair of the police board determined that a complaint against the officer for using excessive and lethal force when other options were available was not substantiated. This decision was further upheld by the Police Complaint Commissioner of British Columbia. ==See also== * Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit of British Columbia * E-Comm, 9-1-1 call and dispatch centre for Southwestern BC ==References * Port Moody Police Department Category:Law enforcement agencies of British Columbia Category:Port Moody ","title":"Port Moody Police Department"},{"id":"6237142","text":"Ruki Vverh!

It was released in 1997 on Warner Bros. Records. It was listed as Entertainment Weekly's album of the year for 1997 and topped many other critic's lists. ==Recording and promotion== Trynin wrote the songs for the album on an acoustic guitar in her living room, following the tour for her debut album Cockamamie.https://web.archive.org/web/19990422104815/http://www.jentrynin.com/cmp/mikesliners.html The song \\"February\\" was chosen as the first single from the album.

A music video was shot for the song to help promote it, however it has never been released. In her 2006 book Everything I'm Cracked Up to Be, Trynin recalled that everyone \\"[hated] the rough cut of the \\"Getaway (February)\\" video, because it's super-hip and happening and no one knows what the hell is going on in it.\\" ==Critical reception== Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic praised the album. He wrote in his review that \\"Cockamamie, Jennifer Trynin's accomplished debut, got lost in the shuffle of all the post- alternative female singer-songwriters of the mid-'90s. Many of those songwriters were less talented than Trynin but were more commercially savvy and, therefore, successful. Perhaps this is the reason her second album, Gun Shy Trigger Happy, has a slicker production than Cockamamie, but even with the polish, Trynin remains one of the better adult-alternative songwriters of the late '90s.\\" A review from People magazine published on September 22, 1997 calls it \\"one of 1997’s strongest and most mature discs.\\"https://people.com/archive/picks-and-pans-review-gun-shy-trigger-happy- vol-48-no-12/ The review states that \\"Her 1994 debut, Cockamamie, showed admirable grrrlish spunk and a few knockout songs, but promising as that release was, it barely hinted at the giant leap forward this 33-year-old Bostonian takes on her dazzling follow-up.

He was drafted by the Calgary Stampeders in the first round of the 1999 CFL Draft. Singh has the distinction of being the only player in football history to have won an XFL Championship, a Super Bowl, and a Grey Cup.Meet Bobby Singh - SB Nation.com ==Early years== Singh was born in Fiji to parents Malkit and Mindy who are of Indian descent. The family moved to Richmond, British Columbia when Bobby was two years old. He attended Garden City Elementary School, Palmer Junior Secondary School, and Richmond Senior Secondary School. Throughout his school years, he was active in sports, including American football, basketball, and track and field. ==College career== After graduating from R.C. Palmer Secondary, he earned a full football scholarship to the University of Hawaii. He played sparingly in 1995, but in 1996 started eleven games for the Warriors and was named an all-WAC Conference Academic. He transferred to Portland State University in 1997, where he was named first team All-Big Sky in his junior year, and All- American/All-Conference/Scholar Athlete of the Year in his senior year. He was a team captain for both his years at Portland State. He graduated with a degree in sociology. ==Professional career== Singh was drafted in the first round, eighth overall by the Calgary Stampeders in the 1999 Canadian College Draft. He signed as a free agent with the St. Louis Rams, winning a Super Bowl ring in Super Bowl XXXIV while on the Rams' practice roster. He underwent back surgery, was released after the season, and spent the 2000 season recovering. In 2001, he signed with the Los Angeles Xtreme of the XFL, playing in six regular season and two playoff games, and winning that league's first and only championship, the Million Dollar Game. He then signed with the San Diego Chargers, but was released at the end of training camp. In 2002, he signed with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League, becoming a starter by the fifth game of the season and playing in sixteen regular season games. After a strong season with Stampeders in 2003, he was named as a finalist for the CFL's Outstanding Canadian Award and CFL's Most Outstanding Offensive Lineman Award. Singh signed with the BC Lions in March 2004. During the 2004 season, he missed five games due to a triceps injury. He started all but two games of the 2005 season, including the Scotiabank West Championship (the CFL West Division final), which the Lions lost to the Edmonton Eskimos by the score of 28-23. Singh was the only member of a troubled Lions' offensive line—the team gave up a league-worst 74 sacks—who did not allow a sack, and was the Lions' 2005 nomination for Outstanding Lineman. In March 2006, Singh signed a four-year contract with the BC Lions. Singh dressed for twelve games in 2006, as well as the West Division final and Grey Cup, which the Lions won over the Montreal Alouettes 25-14, but missed six games due to injury and was used sparingly late in the season. He was released by the Lions on April 5, 2007. Lions head coach and general manager Wally Buono called it a \\"difficult decision\\" necessitated by the CFL's new salary cap, though Singh had offered to take a pay cut. Within a week, Singh had signed with his original CFL team, the Calgary Stampeders. Though he had entertained offers from the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and Toronto Argonauts, Calgary's proximity to Vancouver was a factor in his decision to sign with the Stampeders, and would allow him to fulfill his duties as school trustee. He was released by Calgary just prior to the 2008 CFL season, and was signed by Winnipeg on Sept. 18, 2008. He was released by the Bombers on May 15, 2009. Singh re-signed with the BC Lions on June 25, 2009. ==Personal life== Singh is involved in a variety of volunteer and community work in the Winnipeg area, such as youth football programmes and the Richmond Boys and Girls Club.

Offenders who committed their offence after December 2, 2011 are no longer eligible to apply for the faint hope clause. However, those convicted of offences that occurred prior to that date may still be eligible. ==How the clause works== The prisoner must apply to the Chief Justice of the province where he or she was convicted, and the Chief Justice (or another designated judge) then reviews the application to determine whether there is a reasonable chance the prisoner could be successful in his or her application before a jury; if the applicant is likely to succeed, the court will empanel a jury to hear the application. The jury may hear evidence relating to the character of the prisoner, the prisoner's conduct while in prison, the nature of the offence, the effect of the crime on the family of the victim, and other information the presiding judge deems relevant. The jury then decides whether the parole eligibility period should be reduced, and the decision to reduce the parole eligibility period must be unanimous. If the parole eligibility period is reduced, this permits the prisoner to apply for early parole, and the ultimate decision of whether to grant parole to the prisoner lies with the Parole Board of Canada. Persons convicted of multiple murders that occurred after January 9, 1997 are ineligible to apply for a reduction in their parole eligibility period. This repeal occurred when convicted serial killer/rapist Clifford Olson applied for release under the faint hope clause. > Part of the rationale for the clause, Section 745.6 of the Criminal Code, > was to lower the risk to prison guards from murderers serving life with > little hope of release - and nothing to lose from unleashing > violencehttps://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-study-praising- > faint-hope-clause-for-murderers-never-released/article1322268/ ==History== The section was added in 1976 after Canada abolished the death penalty and replaced it with a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for first and second degree murder. This particular provision was added in order to encourage convicted murderers in Canada to rehabilitate themselves, and to reflect the fact that other countries allowed convicted murderers to be paroled after an average of 15 years incarceration. Judicial Reviews began in 1987. As of October 10, 2010, 1,508 offenders were eligible to apply for a judicial review. Of those eligible, there have been 181 court decisions, and 146 of these have resulted in an offender becoming eligible for earlier parole. Of these, 135 offenders have been granted parole. Critics argue that applications made under the section unfairly traumatize the families of victims, while proponents argue that the section is necessary to give convicted murderers some hope, thus preventing prisons from being even more dangerous than they already are. ===Current status=== The Government of Canada under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, elected in January 2006, pledged during the election campaign to repeal the clause for all offenders. In August 2006, the Canadian Minister of Justice at the time, Vic Toews, re-affirmed this commitment, stating that he would introduce legislation in the fall of 2006 to repeal the Faint Hope Clause. In June 2009, the Conservative Government introduced Bill C-36 to abolish the faint hope clause. In November 2009, the bill passed the House of Commons and was referred to the Senate. The Justice Minister, Rob Nicholson, stated that \\"[b]y ending faint hope reviews, we are saying no to early parole for murderers.\\"Globe and Mail, Jun. 05, 2009 However, the bill died on the order paper in the Senate on December 30, 2009, when Governor General Michaëlle Jean prorogued parliament on the advice of Prime Minister Stephen Harper.Parliament of Canada, LEGISinfo, retrieved Jan. 21, 2010 The same Bill was again reintroduced by the government in the Senate (Bill S-6) during following session of parliament in spring, 2010. After some delay that bill was passed by Parliament and given Royal Assent in March 2011. It came into force in December of that year. The faint hope clause is no longer available for any offences committed after December 2, 2011. ==See also== *Criminal sentencing in Canada == References  *CBC Backgrounder on the Faint Hope Clause *Criminal Code s. 745.6 *Faint Hope: Background.

He received an Artium Baccalaureus degree in 1922 from Harvard University and after attending the Fordham University School of Law received a Bachelor of Laws from Harvard Law School. In 1920, while an undergraduate at Harvard University, he was expelled by its \\"Secret Court\\" of 1920 for associating with a group of homosexuals, including his roommate. He was readmitted a year later. He was an Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1925 to 1927 and again from 1931 to 1933, serving as Chief of the Criminal Division from 1931 to 1933. He served as a special assistant attorney general for the State of New York from 1928 to 1929, in 1930, in 1936 and in 1942. He also served as President of The New York Young Republican Club from 1929 to 1930.https://nyyrc.com/history/ He was in private practice in New York City from 1929 to 1931 and again from 1934 to 1953. He served as an assistant campaign manager for Thomas E. Dewey's unsuccessful campaign for President in 1944. He was a Justice of the New York Supreme Court in 1947. He was the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1953 to 1955. ==Federal judicial service== Lumbard was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on May 13, 1955, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated by Judge John Marshall Harlan. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 11, 1955, and received his commission on the next day. He served as Chief Judge from 1959 to 1971. He was a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States from 1960 to 1971. He assumed senior status on July 20, 1971. His service terminated on June 3, 1999, due to his death in Fairfield, Connecticut. ===Modern Settings v. Prudential=== One landmark decision penned by Lumbard was Modern Settings v. Prudential (1991), which dealt with a dispute between an investor and a broker over alleged unauthorized trading.Justia.com : Modern Settings v. Prudential, May 6, 1991, accessed April 18, 2011 The customer agreement between the parties provided \\"Reports of the execution of orders and statements of my account shall be conclusive if not objected to within five days and ten days, respectively, after transmittal to me (Modern Settings) by mail or otherwise.\\" Lumbard held that such a contract clause is presumptively enforceable. It is reasonable to require that a customer memorialize his objections so courts will not become a forum for endless swearing contests between brokers and customers. On the other hand, he allowed for the possibility of the invalidity of such a clause in some cases. \\"There will be instances where a disparity in sophistication between a brokerage firm and its customer will warrant a flexible application of such written notice clauses.... Similarly, we do not foreclose the possibility that a broker may be estopped from raising a defense based on the written notice clause if the broker's own assurances of deceptive acts forestall the customer's filing of their required written complaint.\\" ==Other service== President Nixon considered naming him special prosecutor in the Watergate scandal before naming Archibald Cox. In 1959, he was appointed to the Harvard Board of Overseers and served for ten years. From 1964 to 1968, He was chairman of the American Bar Association's Committee to Develop Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice. In 1968, he was awarded the A.B.A.'s Gold Medal for his contributions to justice administration. ==References * Category:1901 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit Category:United States court of appeals judges appointed by Dwight D.

Beginning in December 1977 and lasting until March, it produced one of the coldest winters on record in all states east of the Rockies except Maine. ==TimelineDecember=== During December 1977, a cold wave started around the eastern United States. This cold wave heavily hit Michigan and Ohio, whose average winter temperature was to be the second lowest in recorded history, rivaled only by an even colder wave that hit the previous winter. ===January=== Like most cold waves of the 1970s, temperatures in January dropped to extreme lows. Wind chills across the plains fell to between . Severe cold pounded from the Plains states to the Eastern seaboard, where frequent frontal storms caused record snowfall and extreme blizzards,Wagner, A. James; ‘Weather and Circulation of January 1978: Cold with Record Snowfall in the Midwest and Northeast; Mild and Wet in the West’; Monthly Weather Review; 106 (1978); pp. 579-585 which caused some areas to be declared with a state of emergency. Schools and business were closed when pipelines froze over, and severe driving conditions took place. Blowing snow meant that roads could not be cleared, and hundreds of automobile accidents were believed caused by the blizzard conditions.Chagnon jr, Stanley A. and Chagnon, David; ‘Record Winter Storms in Illinois, 1977-78’; Report of Investigation 88; Illinois Department of Registration and Education Tanks had to be used to remove stranded vehicles on some highways.

Severe cold still covered areas from the Northeast and Midwest. Schools began to close because of the extreme cold. Homeless people had a hard time finding shelter, causing some deaths. Snow and blowing wind created dangerous wind chills. Due to blowing snow, ice, and severe cold, semi trucks had their deliveries delayed. Some locations saw a record-long period of below weather. ===March=== The severe cold wave ameliorated only slightly in March, and as late as March 25 a severe storm with freezing rain brought down powerlines in Illinois, hindering rescue efforts by shutting down telephone communications. April, when average or even above average temperatures occurred for the first time since November 1977, saw the real end of the cold wave, but snow melting and flooding caused damage to some locations. Sioux Falls saw its second coldest winter on record during the previous months.

He was born in Ghana in 1966, and majored in art at college. He graduated in 1989. After graduation, Agbee continued to paint while he worked in advertising and design. Working mostly in acrylic on canvas, Agbee focuses almost exclusively on the subject of African women, usually in profile, often drawing on two different motifs for their depiction. Some works, such as Wait A Minute, show them talking in groups, and are characterized by intricate detail of symbols embedded in their clothing or the canvas background. Others, such as Migration, feature the dark, clean profiles of these women on backgrounds of colorful, geometric shapes, somewhat evocative of sand dunes. Agbee has participated in several collective and individual exhibitions in Accra, other locations in Ghana, the Netherlands, the United States, New Zealand and other locations internationally.

Built for the purpose of irrigation, the reservoir, called Lake Dalrymple. Burdekin Dam is managed by SunWater. Water from the reservoir is also used to replenish downstream aquifers. ==Location and features== The dam wall is long and has a spillway, and a drop of . The reservoir holds at full capacity. The design allows for future storage capacity increases and potential for hydro-electricity generation. Plans are in place to increase the safety of this dam in an extreme rainfall event by increasing the spillway capacity. This project is scheduled for completion over the next 5 to 20 years.Current Projects The catchment area for the dam extends north to the Seaview Range west of Ingham, south to the Drummond Range near Alpha through the Suttor and Belyando Rivers, southeast to the coastal ranges west of Mackay, and west beyond Charters Towers to the Lolworth, Montgomery and Stopem Blockem Ranges through the Clarke River. ==History== Construction of the dam began in 1984. It was completed by Leighton Contractors in 1987 and is the largest dam in the state, with a capacity four times that of Sydney Harbour.Leighton Holdings History Burdekin Dam filled after the wet season in 1988. ==Irrigation== The Burdekin River Irrigation Area was granted approval in 1980. It is Queensland's largest land and water conservation scheme. In 2007, the scheme was supplying 103,000 ha of land located about inland from Townsville with water to grow a range of crops including sugar cane, cotton and rice. ==Proposed hydroelectricity== Water discharging at Burdekin Dam's spillway. Stanwell Corporation has begun a feasibility study into a proposed hydroelectric power station below the Burdekin Dam wall. It is proposed it would be capable of producing annually, enough to power more than 9,500 homes each year. ==Boating== There are no boating restrictions, with a single boat ramp located near the dam wall. Water in the dam is often muddied with unsettled sediment long after the rains have washed it into the lake. This not only makes angling difficult but also means boating can be hazardous at high speeds due to the presence of submerged rocks. ==Fauna and flora== The dam has been stocked with sleepy cod, sooty grunter and barramundi. Numerous other species are present naturally, including forktail catfish, spangled perch, eel-tailed catfish, long tom, golden perch and archer fish. A Stocked Impoundment Permit is required to fish in the dam. Red-claw crayfish and freshwater crocodiles are also found in the dam. Saltwater crocodiles may also inhabit the Lake Dalrymple reaches of the dam. == Awards == In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Burdekin Falls Dam was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a \\"structure and engineering feat\\". ==See also== *List of dams and reservoirs in Queensland ==References * Pictures- National Library of Australia * More historical Photos from the NQ Dry Tropics * Burdekin Dam Fishing Information & Map Category:Reservoirs in Queensland Category:Dams completed in 1987 Category:1987 establishments in Australia Category:Dams in Queensland Category:North Queensland Category:Charters Towers Region Category:Whitsunday Region Category:Gravity dams Category:Burdekin River Category:Q150 Icons ","title":"Burdekin Dam"},{"id":"6237277","text":"The Mid Somerset League (currently sponsored by Trophies of Radstock) is a football competition based in England.

It is written by Nigel Smith. The producer is Gareth Edwards. The story revolves around an unsuccessful writer named Ben Smith (Neil Pearson), who is in a coma. While his wife Mary (Fiona Allen) and his mother (Josie Lawrence) hash out their emotional issues at his bedside, he lives in a fantasy world with his 2-year- old daughter \\"Blitzkrieg\\" (real name Beatrice; Leslie Ash), miraculously grown up, and remembers incidents from his life. An imaginary sitcom, apparently written by Ben and concerning a coma ward in a hospital, plays in the background. A second series of 6 episodes began broadcasting on BBC Radio 4 on 25 September 2007. A third series describing Ben's return home, still clinging to his fantasy life, began broadcasting on BBC Radio 4 on 24 November 2009. While the flashbacks in the first series concern Ben and Mary's courtship, pursued somewhat reluctantly on Mary's part, the second series shows the slow process of recovery for Ben in parallel with their marriage, her pregnancy, and Ben's lapses of commitment. Ben's fantasy life revolves around him giving up total control of his fantasy world before returning to a real world where he has no control at all. The third series was preceded by an interlude episode broadcast as the Friday Play on 20 November. In this episode Ben is out of his coma but is suffering from locked-in syndrome. He still experiences memories and fantasies while his wife and mother try to communicate with him. Meanwhile the hospital authorities are considering whether to continue with rehabilitation or ship him to a care home. Writer Nigel Smith spent some time in a coma himself, later describing it in an article in The Times and in an autobiography published in 2007. ==EpisodesSeries One=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%; margin:auto;\\" - ! width=\\"125\\"  No. ! width=\\"125\\"  Episode No. !

Cataclasis involves the granulation, crushing, or milling of the original rock, then rigid-body rotation and translation of mineral grains or aggregates before lithification. Cataclastic rocks are associated with fault zones and impact event breccias. ==Classification== Various classification schemes have been proposed for the cataclastic rocks, but changes in understanding of the processes involved in their formation and better knowledge of the variety of such rocks has made a simple classification difficult, particularly where distinctions cannot be made in hand specimens. Sibson's 1977 classification of fault rocks was the first to include an understanding of the deformation mechanisms involved and all subsequent schemes have been based on this. Fault breccias have been further classified in terms of their origins; attrition, distributed crush and implosion brecciation, and, borrowing from the cave-collapse literature, crack, mosaic and chaotic from their clast concentration. Mylonite was originally defined as a cataclastic rock but is now understood to have formed mainly by crystal- plastic processes. ==TypesCataclasite=== Cataclasite is a fault rock that consists of angular clasts in a finer-grained matrix. It is normally non- foliated but some varieties have been described with a well-developed planar fabric that are known as foliated cataclasites. Cataclasite grades into fault breccia as the percentage of visible clasts increases to more than 30%. ===Fault breccia=== Fault breccia is a fault rock that consists of large fragments of rock in a fine-grained matrix. It may be either cohesive or incohesive. The matrix may also include mineral veins formed in voids between the clasts, which may themselves become fractured by later movements on the fault. ===Fault gouge=== Fault gouge is an unconsolidated and incohesive type of fault rock consisting almost entirely of finely crushed material. Varieties that have a large clay mineral content are known as clay gouges. ===Pseudotachylite=== Pseudotachylite is a fault rock that has the appearance of the basaltic glass, tachylyte. It is dark in color and has a glassy appearance. It is generally found either along a fault surface or as veins injected into the fault walls. Most pseudotachylites have clearly formed by frictional melting, associated with either seismic faulting, some large landslides or meteorite impacts. ==Formation== Cataclastic rocks form by brittle processes in the upper part of the crust in areas of moderate to high strain, particularly in fault zones. The two main mechanisms involved are microfracturing (breaking the original rock into fragments) and frictional sliding/rolling of the fragments, combined with further fracturing. ==Cataclastic flow== Cataclastic flow is the main deformation mechanism accommodating large strains above the brittle-ductile transition zone. It can be regarded as a ductile mechanism, although one that takes place within the elastico-frictional regime of deformation. Deformation is accommodated by the sliding and rolling of fragments within the cataclastic rock. Cycles of cementation and refracturing are generally recognised in such rocks. ==See also== *Pyroclastic ==References== Category:Petrology Category:Structural geology ","title":"Cataclastic rock"},{"id":"6237302","text":"was a member of the Japanese clan of Toyotomi following the Edo period of the 17th century. Kunimatsu was famed for being the son of Toyotomi Hideyori, who was the son of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. His mother was Hideyori's concubine, Icha (伊茶).There is a speculation that Kunimatsu's mother was a daughter of a certain Narita Gohei (成田 五兵衛), member of the Narita clan of Ise--retainers of the Hōjō clan of Odawara, but she was more likely a daughter of one man named Watanabe Gohei (渡辺 五兵衛). His Dharma name was Rōseiin Unsan Chisai Daidōji (漏世院雲山智西大童子). In 1615 during the Siege of Osaka, Hideyori was defeated and committed suicide by seppuku, while his castle was taken by the forces of Tokugawa Hidetada and Tokugawa Ieyasu. Kunimatsu, who was seven years of age at the time, was captured by Tokugawa forces, and was later executed by decapitation. ==Survival theories== Theories and rumors in Japan say he could have escaped through some secret tunnel, and Tokugawa then set up an execution of a decoy or body double (known as a kagemusha), to make official the extinction of Toyotomi's bloodline. He continued to live as , the founder of a new branch of the Kinoshita clan (Hideyoshi's birth clan) in Bungo Province after the Shimazu clan were moved to the Satsuma Domain.Officially, Nobuyoshi was a great-nephew of Hideyoshi's principal wife, Kōdai-in, and the fourth son of , the first lord of the . Despite sharing the same surname, that Kinoshita family shared no known kinship to Hideyoshi, except for a marital bond: Nobutoshi's father, Iesada, was Kōdai-in's brother and his mother, , was her cousin. ==Notesences== *A History of Japan *Perkins, Dorothy (1998).

It is the sequel to the 2004 title Ninja Gaiden and was released worldwide for the Xbox 360 in June 2008. A reimagined and heavily altered version, titled Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 was released for the PlayStation 3 later in 2009, and was published by Tecmo Koei, followed by Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Plus for the PlayStation Vita in 2013. Shortly before its announcement, on September 11th, 2007, screenshots of the game were accidentally leaked by the Japanese Xbox 360 website, and was taken down hours later. A day later on September 12th, the game was previewed with Microsoft in a press conference of Tokyo Game Show 2007, where it was confirmed to exist and be an Xbox 360 exclusive, with the game's director, Tomonobu Itagaki, being stated as saying, \\"Now please enjoy the world's best action game, running on the world's best hardware.\\" 9 days later, on September 20th, 2007, Ninja Gaiden II was officially unveiled to the public, with its first trailer at the Tokyo Game Show 2007, alongside various interviews. The game went unreleased in Germany as a result of lacking an USK rating. Ninja Gaiden II received a positive critical reception, with praise towards its difficulty, fast-paced combat and level of violence, but failed to recapture the acclaim of its predecessor, and was criticized for not being a substantial improvement over its predecessor. It was considered a commercial success, selling over one million copies by August 28th, 2008. A sequel, Ninja Gaiden 3, was released in March 20, 2012, without the involvement of Tomonobu Itagaki. ==Gameplay== Ryu Hayabusa fighting enemies in Ninja Gaiden II Ninja Gaiden IIs new combat system allows the player character Ryu to dismember his enemies, severing their limbs and tearing their bodies apart covering his weapon and everything around with blood. Compared to Ninja Gaiden, the sequel contains more gore and graphic violence.TGS07: Cutting Through Ninja Gaiden II Dismemberment will weaken or slow down an enemy, depending on if an arm or leg is severed, but not necessarily kill it. In fact, an injured enemy will be prone to use suicide tactics such as pinning Ryu down and planting an incendiary shuriken on him, forcing the player to quickly finish off his opponents using new, brutal Obliteration Techniques before injured enemies can get the upper hand. This new mechanic can also be triggered in the presence of boss characters. Compared to other action-adventure titles, the player can be just as vulnerable to attack as the enemies can during fight encounters. Aside from his standard melee techniques, Ryu can absorb nearby essence in combat. These colored globes of energy are released from the bodies of slain enemies, and absorbed into Ryu's body when he comes close to them. Essence has an important role towards general game play, acting to heal Ryu, restore his ki, or increase his cash. However, the player can cause Ryu to deliberately draw in essence, which can then be used to unleash powerful attacks known as Ultimate Techniques. When Ryu fights and takes damage, there is a red bar that starts building on the right of Ryu's health bar, which is called lasting damage. After Ryu has slaughtered all of his enemies in that particular area, his health recharges, but only to the point where the red bar starts. Herbs of Spiritual Life and Save Statues can heal this lasting damage, however. Also when Ryu is done fighting, he performs a chiburui (the act of swatting blood off of his weapon). He does this for every weapon, with a different animation for each one. Ryu can stand still and attempt to block attacks (though enemies can break his guard and leave him vulnerable to attack) or he can dodge by dashing away in a maneuver called Reverse Wind. The game also takes two elements from the \\"Hurricane Pack\\" upgrade from the original game: camera rotation and the ability to charge up for an Ultimate technique without the need for essence (this takes time to charge up; essence can still be absorbed to speed up the process). Ryu will use his signature Dragon Sword in combat, but new weapons, such as the Eclipse Scythe, Dragon's Claw and Tiger's Fang swords, Tonfa, Kusari-gama and the Falcon's Talons ninja claws will allow the player more variety in dispatching enemies. Ryu's new magical spells, in the form of ninpo, includes the Art of the Flame Phoenix, Art of the Wind Blades, and the Art of the Piercing Void. However, weapons and ninpo from the original Ninja Gaiden will return in the form of the Art of the Inferno and the Vigoorian Flail. The returning Windmill Shuriken, Incendiary Shurikens, and bow (Renamed the Fiend's Bane Bow), can now draw in essences like all of Ryu's melee weapons to discharge their own Ultimate Technique. ==Plot== The game's protagonist is Ryu Hayabusa, master ninja, descendant of the Dragon Ninja lineage and current wielder of the Dragon Sword. One year after Ninja Gaiden Black, master blacksmith Muramasa is setting up shop in Tokyo, Japan. A CIA agent named Sonia enters the place and asks for Ryu's whereabouts, until members of the Black Spider Ninja Clan attack the shop and kidnap her. Enter the Dragon Ninja Ryu, who fails to stop Sonia's kidnapping and makes haste around the Tokyo skyscrapers and rescues the agent, who informs him of an attack on the Hayabusa Village by the Black Spider Ninjas, who wish to steal the Demon Statue they possess and protect. Ryu returns to his home and finds his father, Joe Hayabusa dueling with Genshin, leader of the Black Spider Ninja Clan. Unfortunately, the Demon Statue is taken away by Queen of the Greater Fiends and the Ruler of Blood, Elizébet, and Joe urges his son to retrieve the statue at all costs. Ryu travels around the world with Sonia, in pursuit of Elizébet and the Demon Statue, while encountering legions of Black Spider Ninjas, Fiends, and three other Greater Fiends: Alexei, the Graceful Ruler of Lightning; Volf, the Invincible Ruler of Storms; and Zedonius, the Malevolent Ruler of Flame. Ryu tracks Elizébet down to South America, where she offers the Demon Statue to Infernal High Priest Dagra Dai, in order to resurrect the ancient Archfiend, Vazdah. Elizébet duels with Ryu and he defeats her, but Elizébet proclaims her return. An overlooking Genshin explains that the fiends are looking to resurrect the Archfiend who is supposed to emerge from Mount Fuji back in Japan. The mountain is also the place which bound both the Black Spider Clan and The Dragon Lineage. Ryu returns home, cautioning Sonia not to follow him. As Ryu overlooks the fire- brimming Mount Fuji, Ayane enters with the Eye of the Dragon, a gift from Joe Hayabusa, and Ryu equips the relic onto his Dragon Sword, forming the True Dragon Sword again. Heading to the mountain's summit, Ryu finds Genshin waiting for him at the crater's entrance. As Mount Fuji erupts, Genshin reveals to Ryu that he never cared for \\"tantrums of the archfiend\\" and that their moment has finally arrived. The two ninjas fight to the death before Genshin falls dead and Ryu leaps into Mount Fuji. Elizébet appears over a deceased Genshin looking to revive him as a fiend as Ryu descends into Mount Fuji. Ryu fights past hordes of Fiends and singlehandedly defeats Zedonius, Volf, and Alexei, and rescues a captured Sonia. He instructs her to stay put and to not move. Ryu heads into another room and finds a resurrected Genshin, transformed into a Fiend, back for a fourth and final battle. The two ninja battle in another arduous battle ending with Ryu eventually cutting Genshin down, even splitting his face armor doing so. Genshin and Ryu, though mortal adversaries, share a final mutual respect as ninja in Genshin's dying moment. Genshin shares with Ryu that all of his actions were meant to strengthen the Black Spider Clan as a whole (his cause all along) and has no regrets of pursuing that. He acknowledges Ryu as a great warrior, and in support of Ryu's cause hands him the cursed blade of the archfiend for use before dying. A furious Elizébet appears, and chastises the Black Spider Ninja for losing, even with his power. Ryu attacks Elizébet, and angrily cuts her down to red dust with the combination of his own dragon sword and Genshin's blade of the archfiend. He states that the overlord had more to live for than she ever would. Traveling deeper into the Underworld, Ryu confronts Dagra Dai, who is nearly finished with the Archfiend's resurrection, and defeats him. As a last resort, the Infernal High Priest offers his life to Vazdah, and the Archfiend is reborn. Ryu takes down the monstrosity and heads to the surface with Sonia, but a drop of his blood from an open wound accidentally spills onto the fiend and revitalizes Vazdah, who ascends to the summit in its true form. Amidst an erupting Mount Fuji, Ryu squares off with the Archfiend in a climatic duel to decide humanity's fate and wins. Sonia and Ryu reunite and climb to the top of the mountain, sharing the sunrise together. In a post-credits scene, amongst a field with countless number of blades embedded into the ground, Ryu plants Genshin's Blade of the Archfiend into the ground and bows in respect for the Black Spider Overlord. Ryu, \\"The Dragon Ninja\\" takes one last look before taking off into the fog. The plot is continued in Ninja Gaiden 3 and its expansion Razor's Edge. ==Development and release== Promotion of Ninja Gaiden II at the left Initial screenshots of Ninja Gaiden II leaked on the Japanese official Xbox 360 website, but were removed within a matter of hours in September 11th, 2007.

MacEwan University's sports teams are known as the Griffins.MacEwan University website - MacEwan Griffins. Men's and women's sports include: basketball, hockey, volleyball, soccer, cross country, curling and golf. The Griffins compete in the Alberta Colleges Athletics Conference (ACAC), against 16 other post- secondary institutions in Alberta as well as in the Canada West conference of U Sports. Student-athletes on all teams are expected to meet academic requirements and adhere to sport-specific athletic requirements. In 2011, MacEwan's athletic department submitted an application to Canada West Universities Athletic Association in an effort to transfer to the national U Sports level of competition. MacEwan University was admitted as a probationary member in 2013. In 2016, the University was granted full membership becoming the 56th full member of U Sports, then known as CIS. ==Campuses== As of 2017, MacEwan University has two campuses. City Centre Campus (CCC) is the largest of the campuses, currently spanning seven city blocks in downtown Edmonton. In its early years, MacEwan operated out of a number of small store-front-style campuses in Edmonton. The facilities included Old Scona School (10523 - 84 Avenue), the Workmen's Compensation Board (WCB) building (10048 - 101A Avenue), 7th Street Plaza (10030-107 Street), and the former Dominion Store in Cromdale (8020 - 118 Avenue), with offices and administration located in the Canada Trust building (10150 - 100 Street). In 1988, Don Getty's provincial government committed $100 million for the construction of the City Centre Campus which, at the time, was Alberta Advanced Education and Technology's largest single capital project in its history. Construction on City Centre Campus began in 1991 on the former site of the Canadian National rail yards on the northern fringe of the downtown Edmonton core. The land was donated by CN. In September 2009, MacEwan University's Board of Governors approved a plan to move all of the university's operations—spread across four campuses at the time—to the main City Centre Campus. The first step of this consolidation was taken with the opening of the University Service Centre in April 2011. Construction for the new Centre for the Arts and Culture began in 2014 on the west end of the City Centre Campus, with a scheduled opening in the fall of 2017. ===City Centre Campus=== Main entrance of MacEwan City Centre Campus. City Centre Campus houses the majority of MacEwan University's degree programs. The campus is also home to university courses, diplomas and certificates in health, human services and business. Most of the university's administration is located at City Centre Campus as well. The south entrance to the main complex is contained within the centremost of the three groups of concrete spires, which also contains a public clock. The main complex consists of a long grouping of structures stretching from east to west: the 105 Street Building (Building 5), the 106 Street Building (Building 6), the 107 Street Building (Building 7), and the Christenson Family Centre for Sport and Wellness (Building 8). Between each of these buildings is grouping of four concrete spires which gives the campus its distinctive look. Each of these groupings of towers forms a terminating vista both when viewed from the north or the south, interrupting the streets after which the buildings are named. The towers which terminate 107 Street also feature public clock between the spires on the south face. The section of 108 Street to the south of the campus is known as \\"Capital Boulevard\\" and runs to the Alberta Legislature Building seven blocks to the south where it forms another terminating vista. A pedway over 109 Street connects these buildings to the Robbins Health Learning Centre (Building 9, 2007) and the University Service Centre above the parkade (Building 10, 2011). Another pedway connects Building 9 to Allard Hall (Building 11, 2017) which includes the John and Maggie Mitchell Art Gallery. MacEwan Residence is a 13-story building and the only building not connected by pedway. In addition to a bicycle storage room, a hockey equipment storage room is also available for resident use. The Christenson Family Centre for Sport and Wellness is home to a pool, gymnasium and fitness centre. In 2017, the university began construction of a 50,000 square foot student union building next to the Christenson Family Centre. The building is three stories tall,https://edmonton.skyrisecities.com/database/projects/macewan-students- association-building-samu and held its official opening in January 2020.https://edmonton.skyrisecities.com/news/2020/01/macewan-students- association-building-samu-celebrates-grand-opening ==Former Campuses== The university's South Campus, located in Mill Woods, closed in 2014, with all of its programs relocated to City Centre Campus. The Centre for the Arts and Culture (CAC) campus was located on the west end of the city in West Jasper Place. CAC closed in 2017 when MacEwan relocated the Faculty of Fine Arts and Communications to Allard Hall at City Centre Campus. The Centre for the Arts and Communications (formerly known as Jasper Place Campus) was located in Edmonton's west end on the north east corner of 156 Street and 100 Avenue. The Centre for the Arts and Communications (CFAC) housed several creative programs in arts and cultural management, design, fine art, communications, music, theatre arts and theatre production, including MacEwan University's Bachelor of Music in Jazz and Contemporary Popular Music. In the fall of 2017, all CFAC programs and operations were relocated to a new building located on MacEwan's City Centre Campus. The building is approximately 430,000 square feet in size and connect via pedway to the Robbins Health Learning Centre. In June 2000, the government of Alberta assumed control of the formerly private Alberta College. Alberta College was then incorporated as a MacEwan campus. Alberta College is only 1 km from the City Centre Campus, and houses academic upgrading, music and English as a Second Language (ESL) programs. In 2019, MacEwan University sold the Alberta College Campus to the Edmonton Public School Board (EPSB) https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/centre-high- will-move-to-alberta-college-campus-in-fall-2020 as part of a wider campus- consolidation strategy. Beginning in fall 2020, the Alberta College Campus will be the home for Centre High, a specialized EPSB program for vulnerable youth. == 2017 Phishing Scam Incident == In August 2017, MacEwan University staff unwittingly transferred $11.8 million CAD to a scammer posing as a construction vendor.https://globalnews.ca/news/3710654/macewan-university- loses-nearly-12m-in-phishing-scam/ Generating emails seemingly addressed to Edmonton-area Clark Builders, the scammers convinced staff to transfer three payments to the fraudulent account, ranging in amounts between $22,000 and $9.9 million.https://globalnews.ca/news/3710654/macewan-university-loses- nearly-12m-in-phishing-scam/ The scammers had apparently impersonated \\"14 construction firms from around Edmonton\\"https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/macewan-university-phishing-scam- cautionary-tale/ in their attempt to defraud the university.

As the head of the Western Canada Society to Access Justice he was instrumental in setting up numerous pro-bono clinics across western Canada. He charged extremely low fees, and his net income in the years 1991 to 1999 did not exceed $30,000 per year. Christie is most noteworthy for a 2005 court challenge of a British Columbia law that extended provincial sales tax to legal services. Christie argued that the law unjustly infringed on the constitutionally-protected rights of low income people to access the justice system. He met with partial success at the Court of Appeal, but a further appeal at the Supreme Court of Canada overturned the lower court's decision on May 25, 2007. In 2006 Christie began an effort to bicycle across Canada in order to raise awareness of the shortcomings of legal assistance programs in Canada. On July 31, 2006 in Sault Ste.

The draft is held once every year, approximately six weeks prior to the start of the upcoming season (typically late April or early May). Since 2014, U Sports players become eligible for the CFL Draft three years after completing their first year of eligibility at university. Additionally, NCAA and NAIA players are eligible to be selected after completing their senior season of eligibility. Prior to this change, all players would become eligible four years after first attending a post-secondary institution, leading many players to return to school after being drafted.Everything to know about the quirky CFL draft Canadian national university and college players are not permitted to enter the league without being subject to the draft and players are only eligible to be drafted once.Draft History Import/international players are not subject to the draft and are instead inducted via the negotiation list process. Formerly held as part of annual league meetings in Hamilton, and occasionally televised, the draft was previously held via conference call. In 2007, the league began producing a free webcast of the event. Starting in 2009, the first two rounds were broadcast live on TSN. ==History== CFL Draft logo used until 2012. Before the CFL Draft was implemented, teams selected players based on territorial rights. For the sake of fair competition, a draft would be held to ensure an equal representation of players and talent. An experimental draft was held in 1952 by what was then the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (now the East Division of the CFL); the first formal Canadian football draft was held the next year. Selection was limited to players from five universities in Ontario and Quebec: McGill University, Queen's University, University of Toronto, University of Western Ontario, and McMaster University. The Montreal Alouettes selected Doug McNichol from Western Ontario as he became the first Canadian football player to be drafted. In 1956, with the establishment of the Canadian Football Council, a nationwide draft was established, with the five teams of the Western Interprovincial Football Union now taking part and players from all Canadian universities becoming eligible. Additionally, the conference that featured the losing team in the Grey Cup would have its team with the poorest record select first. Two years later, the formation of the present-day Canadian Football League was complete. Further modifications to the structure of the draft took place in the 1973 CFL Draft as Canadian players from American schools would now be eligible for the draft. Prior to this, teams would be awarded territorial rights for non-import players from U.S.-based schools based on the territory in which he was domiciled. Because this would almost eliminate any geographical exemptions, teams would also be permitted to make two territorial exemptions per draft, regardless of school location, beginning in 1973. Territorial exemptions were last made in 1984 as they were abolished in 1985, introducing the modern era of the CFL Draft. In 1986, the draft was reduced from nine rounds to eight rounds and was further reduced to seven rounds in 1993. In 1997, the CFL Draft consisted of only six rounds, which was a format that was used until it was changed in 2013 when it was expanded to seven rounds. For the 2016 CFL Draft, the format was changed to include eight rounds of selections.Canadian Football League expands draft to eight rounds ==Selection order== The selection order of the draft is based on a combination of the regular season standings and post-season results from the previous season. Non-Grey Cup participants are ranked in reverse order of the previous season's standings with the team with the league-worst record being awarded the first overall pick. Any ties between teams in different conferences are decided the same way as tied division opponents: first by season series, then by other tie-breaking formulas. The losing team in the previous year's Grey Cup game selects second-last while the winner of the previous year's Grey Cup selects last in each round. The order remains the same in each round. Teams are permitted to trade draft picks before and during the draft for either another team's draft picks or players. This is a common practice resulting in some teams having multiple selections in one round while other teams may have none. Teams may also trade conditional draft picks, meaning the transaction will only occur if a condition is fulfilled (for example, if a traded player plays enough games or signs a contract extension with his new team). ==See also== * List of first overall Canadian Football League draft picks * CFL Combine ==References * CFL Canadian Draft * Draft results 1952–present * Category:Canadian football Category:Annual sporting events in Canada Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1956 Category:1956 establishments in Canada ","title":"CFL Draft"},{"id":"6237357","text":"' covers most of western Nebraska, comprises 69 counties and is considered to be a traditional Republican stronghold. In the 2006 midterm elections, Republican incumbent Tom Osborne did not seek re-election, instead making a failed bid for the Nebraska gubernatorial nomination. In his stead, Republican Adrian Smith, who won the Republican primary with 39% of the vote in a field of five candidates, defeated Democratic nominee Scott Kleeb, 55% to 45%. This ten-point margin was the closest election in the 3rd District since 1990, prompting both candidates to receive a variety of endorsements during the race. This was the closest a Democrat had come to winning the district in 18 years; in 1990, Republican Bill Barrett won 51% to 49% over fellow unicameral state senator Sandra K. Scofield. Approximately one-third of the funding of Smith's campaign came from members of the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative group that supports tax cuts, limited government, and school choice, and advocates eliminating all agricultural subsidies and the elimination of the US Department of Agriculture. For a time, Smith was presumed to be a prohibitive favorite in this overwhelmingly Republican district. The 3rd is one of the most Republican districts in the nation; presidential and statewide candidates routinely win it with 70 percent or more of the vote. The 3rd is extremely difficult to campaign in and has few unifying influences. It covers nearly , two time zones, and 68.5 of Nebraska’s 93 counties (one of which, Cherry County, is larger than the entire state of Connecticut). Both Smith and Kleeb raised and spent more money than any prior third district race. As the race become more competitive than expected, it received late national attention from the House campaign committees. In a very strong year for Democrats, the 2006 3rd District congressional race drew last- minute attention from the national House campaign committees as well as a campaign visit from President George W. Bush on Smith's behalf two days before the election. President George W. Bush also made an appearance in the district two days before the election to campaign for Smith—a sign that the national party was very concerned about its chances in what had long been presumed to be a very safe Republican seat. Toward the end of the campaign, controversy surrounded a series of automated telephone calls to voters. These calls used an unauthorized recording of Kleeb's voice which allegedly distorted his views, and were often made in the middle of the night. Investigations were made to determine the source of these calls, which The New York Times claimed \\"sabotaged\\" Kleeb's campaign. After thorough investigation by the Nebraska Public Service Commission the complaint file was closed with no wrongdoing found by the Kleeb vendor of robocalls, political candidates or their committees. Since the 2006 election, Adrian Smith has won re-election in the 3rd District with at least 70% of the vote each time. He was elected with 77% of the vote in 2008, 70% in 2010, and 74% in 2012. ==Notes * Scott Kleeb's campaign site * Adrian Smith's Campaign site * OpenSecrets.org - Smith and Kleeb Contributions by ZIP Code campaign contributions * OpenSecrets.org - Smith and Kleeb Contributions by In-State vs. Out-of-State campaign contributions Nebraska 2006 03 Nebraska 2006 03 2006 03 Special Nebraska 03 Special United States House of Representatives 03 Special United States House of Representatives 2006 03 ","title":"2006 Nebraska's 3rd congressional district election"},{"id":"6237364","text":"Georgette Anne Sheridan (born 12 June 1952) is a Canadian lawyer and politician from Saskatchewan. ==Biography== She was born on 12 June 1952 in Calgary, Alberta.

Releasing records on Q Division Records, the band was composed of Dave Wanamaker and Pete Armata, both of the 1990s rock band Expanding Man, Jen Trynin, and Tom Polce from Letters to Cleo. ==Formation== The band formed as a project by Wanamaker and Armata in 1999. They both recruited Polce to play drums, and Wanamaker successfully included Trynin in a guitar-playing/ back-up vocalist role. In 2000, the band, named after the My Bloody Valentine album Loveless, threw together a 5-song EP, featuring four tracks that would appear on their future full-length album, and one other track, \\"Natural.\\" During this time, the band began to tour around the Northeast area, playing a few shows every month, especially in New York City and Boston, where the members resided. ==Gift to the World== The band had to take a break in the midst of preparing the new album because of Trynin's pregnancy, extending the wait between EP and album to 3 years. Polce has stated that they had initially planned to release the album a year after the EP, but when Trynin announced she was pregnant, they collectively decided to wait to release the album until she would be able to tour with them. The band finally released the full-length album, Gift to the World, on November 11, 2003. The album received critical acclaim from many publications, including The Boston Globe, Rolling Stone, and Spin Magazine. The lead single, \\"Go,\\" received considerable airplay on Boston and New York radio, and was included in an online campaign for the Abercrombie & Fitch clothing company. However, following the release, the band didn't tour or promote the album as many expected them to. The record release show wasn't held until January 18, 2004, two months after the album release. From then on, the band played a lot of one-off opening shows, never really hitting a touring stride or playing another headlining show. During a show opening for Kay Hanley in August 2004, at The Paradise Rock Club in Boston, Massachusetts, Wanamaker announced it as being the last Loveless show ever, stating that, \\"I think the band is done.\\" Since that show, the band has gone on an indefinite hiatus. On January 10, 2015, Expanding Man reunited for a one-off concert at Brighton Music Hall in Boston. Loveless opened the show (since half the band was playing with Expanding Man anyway) and played a blistering set for not having played together in over 10 years. However, the show proved to be just an isolated reunion, and the band has since gone on 'hiatus.' ==Post-Loveless== * Dave Wanamaker has continued as a guitarist and songwriter most recently featured on releases by Howie Day and New York based Ocean Carolina.

Construction for the coaster began in June 1999 and was completed in May 2000. The coaster was built by Custom Coasters International using Southern Yellow Pine wood; while the track is made of Douglas Fir. This ride was ranked the #1 Wooden Roller Coaster in the World by the Golden Ticket Awards in 2004 and from 2013 to 2016, until slipping into third place in 2017. The trains were built by Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters. == Statistics and additional information == This 4,672 foot wooden roller coaster uses the Lake Compounce's natural mountainous terrain, complete with trees and boulders within close proximity of the track. The lift climbs the mountainside and then disappears from view. When it reappears, it has completed its first drop of 115 feet and is traveling sixty miles per hour as it crosses over itself and flies over the station. Much of the first half of the ride is hidden as the train climbs and drops along the mountainside. On the last drop, on-ride photos are taken and can be viewed and bought at the photo booth at the end of the exit line. Most of the ride was retracked during the 2007 off season and during the 2008 off season the remainder was retracked. Lake Compounce bought PTC trains from Hersheypark's Wildcat for the 2008 season. For the 2017 Season, Boulder Dash received a retracking by Martin and Vleminckx to help smooth out rough patches and replace rotting wood. The retracking also removed the triple-up hill located near the end of the ride, replacing it with a double-up hill. Its layout was inspired by the Rollo Coaster, a small wooden coaster at Idlewild Park (both parks are owned by the same company, Parques Reunidos). == Awards and rankings == Boulder Dash was voted the world's number one wooden roller coaster in 2001 and 2004 by the National Amusement Park Historical Association, and it took the top spot in Amusement Today's Golden Ticket Awards for Best Wood Coaster five times since 2004. It has been a top 5 wooden roller coaster since 2001.

He played professionally with the Columbus Destroyers in the Arena Football League. ==High school career== Zwick played his freshman year of high school football at Orrville High School in Orrville, Ohio. While there, Zwick's team won a state championship his freshman year. Following his sophomore year, he transferred to Massillon Washington High School in Massillon, Ohio, where he also played basketball and ran track. While at Massillon, he played with future Buckeye teammate Devin Jordan. His senior year in Massillon was impressive, throwing for 3,821 yards and 40 touchdowns. His 110 career passing touchdowns puts him at third all-time in Ohio high school history, and at the time of his graduation, his 10,500 career passing yards was the state record. He also still holds the Massillon Tigers record for passing yards in a game - 407, vs. Javon Ringer led Chaminade-Julienne his senior year, and passing yards in a season - 3,281, also his senior year. He once held the record at Orrville High School for passing yards in a season, with 2,556 yards his sophomore year, but that has since been passed. Zwick earned several accolades following his senior year, including a consensus All-Ohio selection, being named the Associated Press Co-Offensive Player of the Year, appearing on almost every All-American team, and garnering an Elite 11 invitation. ==College career== Zwick went to Ohio State as one of the highest rated quarterbacks in the nation coming out of high school. He was redshirted his freshman year, with Craig Krenzel and Scott McMullen already ahead of him at the quarterback position. Following the 2003 season, Zwick was expected by most to be the replacement to the departing Krenzel. He began the 2004 season, his sophomore year of eligibility, as the starter, and started the first six games of the year. During the game against Iowa, Zwick was forced to leave with an injury, opening the door for Troy Smith. Smith's exciting style of play kept him in the starting role, rendering Zwick to the backup position. He would return to the starter's role for the Alamo Bowl following Smith's suspension from the team, and led the Buckeyes to a dominating 33-7 victory over the Oklahoma State Cowboys. Zwick completed 17 of his 27 passing attempts for 189 yards in the bowl game. The following season, controversy abounded in Columbus over which player should be the starting quarterback. Zwick started the season opener against Miami (OH), because Smith was still suspended, and the following game against Texas. Many fans feel that Ohio State lost that game because of their indecisiveness at the quarterback position, with Zwick and Smith subbing in and out for most of the game.http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2159925 After the loss against Texas, Smith was named the team's full-time starter. Zwick would appear in four more games that season, after the Buckeyes had comfortable leads and the games were well in hand. ==Professional career== Zwick got his first professional experience with the Indianapolis Colts, who invited him to mini-camp on a tryout basis. Zwick got an opportunity to work with his idol, Peyton Manning, but was not offered a contract following this chance.http://www.heraldonline.com/2007/06/11/48886/panthers-give-ohio-states- zwick.html He was subsequently signed by the Carolina Panthers on June 11, 2007, between their mini-camp and training camp. However, he was released on July 9, prior to the start of training camp. On February 9, 2008, the Columbus Destroyers of the Arena Football League signed Zwick to their roster. Several weeks later, the Destroyers announced intentions to move Zwick to the practice squad, but he was given an outright release on February 24. Just two days later, though, the team signed Zwick to play as the backup to starting quarterback Matt Nagy. ==Referenceses== *\\"Scout.com: Justin Zwick Profile.\\" Retrieved August 3, 2006. * (December 29, 2004). \\"2006 Alamo Bowl History.\\" Retrieved August 3, 2006. * (September 13, 2005).\\"Buck the Starter: Smith Replaces Zwick for Ohio State\\".

Zoomerang is one of the forty-five functioning Vekoma boomerang style roller coasters in the world. They all feature a cobra roll and a loop, but the Lake Compounce Boomerang was the first boomerang to receive a Vekoma designed train. Early models used trains designed by Arrow Dynamics. In September 2007, due to paint deterioration, the ride was repainted with a new color scheme with purple tracks and teal supports. == Ride description == The train begins its backwards climb up the first of the ride's two 116 foot lift hills, both of which are placed diagonally towards each other. The train continues to slowly rise for thirty seconds before dropping at forty-seven miles per hour right through the station and through the coaster's first inversion, a Cobra Roll, exerting as many as 5.2 g's on riders throughout the two elements. The train then goes through a loop before ending up on the second lift section. The second lift pulls riders upwards for a few seconds, then releases, sending riders backwards. The train encounters the loop first this time, only to then go through the cobra roll once again which leads riders back through the station and partially up the first lift section again. The train then slowly lowers back down into the station, having sent riders through 935 feet of three inversions in total, both forwards and backwards. == Incidents == On June 14, 2001, just a day after an employee was decapitated while weed-cutting under the coaster Boulder Dash, the sensor on Zoomerang failed to communicate properly with the rides automatic braking system, allowing the train of cars to continue on its own energy until it came to rest in a section of track 60 feet in the air, in the low point of the ride's cobra roll. Twenty-six passengers were left stranded in their seats until firefighters evacuated the ride. None of the passengers were injured.

It was built in 1927 and is the park's centerpiece. It is one of the world's oldest roller coasters still in operation at the same location. It greatly resembles the now-defunct Wildcat roller coaster at Elitch Gardens Theme Park in Denver. Wildcat has received the American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE) Coaster Landmark Award for its historical significance. ==History== The Wildcat is a double out and back wooden coaster designed by Herbert Paul Schmeck and built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company in 1927. Before the Wildcat was built, the Green Dragon Coaster used to stand in its place. In 1926, park owners Pierce and Norton contracted with the Philadelphia Toboggan Company for a new ride to replace the park's aging Green Dragon coaster. With the help of Herbert P. Schmeck, they created the Wildcat. The Wildcat featured a twister style layout including elements such as airtime and tunnels.. The Wildcat's original trains were built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company. The entire structure was rebuilt with new wood in 1985, and the last bunny hills were retracked in 2004. The Wildcat went down for refurbishment on September 17, 2006 and reopened for the 2007 operating season. During its refurbishment, the brake runs were completely removed and rebuilt with new magnetic brakes. The station also received air gates in the queue line and individual seat belts were added to each seat. In 2017, the ride got a full retracking by Martin & Vleminckx.

Wildcat utilizes its design to twist around itself, while serving as the parks centerpiece. Once you leave the station the train turns slightly right and then left before climbing the 85-foot lift hill and dropping 73.7 feet. The lift hill is adjacent to the park entrance. The initial drop is followed by a left-banked curve and into a few more smaller hills until then reaching a right-banked curved leading into several more small hills. The train then curves right onto a section of bunny hills where it continues until it reaches the tunnel, where the brakes are. The ride is known for giving a rough ride. == References == Category:Roller coasters introduced in 1927 Category:Roller coasters in Connecticut ","title":"Wildcat (Lake Compounce)"},{"id":"6237433","text":"Dusty Fingers is the name of a series of compilation records of songs that are widely admired as breakbeats collected by Bronx DJ Danny Dann the Beat Mann. & Jason Jaz, Dusty Fingers interview at HipHopDX Some of the songs featured contain \\"open breaks\\" which are solo drum passages which enable DJs to easily transition into them.

The term 'Punjabi' can mean both a person who lives in Punjab and also a speaker of the Punjabi language. This name originates from the Persian language 'panj', (five), and 'ab', (water). In Rigvedic times, this area was called Sapta Sindhu or 'Seven Rivers' illustrating the extent of Undivided Punjab. Indus River (the largest river in this five river system), and the five other rivers to the south eventually join Indus or merge into it later in the downstream of the Punjab valley. All the rivers start and flow out of the Himalayas. These other five rivers are Jhelum River, Chenab River, Ravi River, Beas River and Sutlej River. ==HistoryMiddle Ages=== The culture of Punjab in the Middle Ages was extremely diverse dependent upon an individual's caste, community, religion and village . An array of cultures can be found historically .The main cultures that arose in the Punjab during the Medieval Age at the beginning of this era was of strong Indo-Aryan dominance. The Shalimar Gardens in Lahore ===Modern era=== Due to the large number of Punjabi people distributed throughout the world, especially Pakistan and India, many people are increasingly experiencing the culture and becoming influenced by it. Glimpses of traditional Punjabi culture can be seen in the Western world (e.g. the U.S., the UK, the EU, Canada, Australia, Africa and the Middle East). Naturally people influence each other wherever they settle and live. Punjabi culture is evident from Punjabi philosophy, poetry, spirituality, education, artistry, music, cuisine, and architecture. Similar migrations by or invasions into the Punjab, in the past many centuries, were by the Aryans, Dravidians, Scythians, Portuguese, Spaniards, Armenians, Greeks or Alexander the Great which reached as far as the Beas River in the Punjab , Mongols Arabs, Persians, Afghans, Turko-Persians (Mughals) and then the Europeans (British) came to Punjab for various economic reasons of their own and its fertile agricultural lands and abundance of water resources in its five large rivers flowing down from the Himalayas through the Punjab valley. These immigrants influenced the people of Punjab and, in turn, were influenced by the then prevailing culture of the Punjab. ==Art== Tirlok Singh's artwork Maati ka Putla Sobha Singh and Amrita Sher-Gil are famous punjabi painting artists. ==Music== Bhangra tournament concert Bhangra is one of the many Punjabi musical art forms that is increasingly listened to in the west and is becoming a mainstream favourite. Punjabi music is used by western musicians in many ways, such as mixing it with other compositions to produce award-winning music. In addition, Punjabi classical music is increasingly becoming popular in the west. Devotional songs are played by dhaddi jatha groups, with instruments like sarangi and dhadd drums. ==Dance== Owing to the long history of the Punjabi culture and of the Punjabi people there are many dances, normally performed at times of celebration, including harvests, festivals and weddings. The particular background of the dances can be non-religious and religious. The overall style can range from the high energy \\"bhangra\\" men's dance to the more reserved \\"jhumar,\\" the \\"gidha\\" women's dance and \\"Malwayi Gidha\\" is a form of dance can be performed by both men and women together. ==Weddings== Punjabi people at a wedding Punjabi wedding traditions and ceremonies are traditionally conducted in Punjabi and are a strong reflection of Punjabi culture. While the actual religious marriage ceremony among Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists and Christians may be conducted in Arabic, Urdu, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Hindi or Pali by the Qazi, Pundit, Granthi or Priest, there are commonalities in ritual, song, dance, food, and dress. The Punjabi wedding has many rituals and ceremonies that have evolved since traditional times. == Crafts == The city of Amritsar in the Punjab state of India is home to the craft of brass and copper metalwork done by the Thatheras of Jandiala Guru, which is enlisted on the UNESCO's List of Intangible Cultural Heritage. Years of neglect had caused this craft to die out, and the listing prompted the Government of Punjab to undertake a craft revival effort under Project Virasat. ==Cuisineage and literature== The Punjabi language is written with the Gurmukhi alphabet in India and with the Shahmukhi alphabet in Pakistan. Approximately 130 million people speak the Punjabi language. In Punjabi literature has three major Punjabi romantic epic poems based on folktales: Heer Ranjha by the poet Waris Shah (1722-1798), Sohni Mahiwal and Mirza Sahiban (sung by late Alam Lohar). By the 10th century, many Hindu Nath poets were associated with earlier Punjabi works. Among the major Punjabi poets are Baba Fariduddin Ganjshakar (1179-1266), Baba Guru Nanak (1469-1539) and Bulleh Shah (1680-1757). ==Dress== The traditional dress for Punjabi men is the kurta and tehmat, which is being replaced by the kurta and pajama, especially the popular muktsari style in India. The traditional dress for women is the salwar suit which replaced the traditional Punjabi ghagra. The patiala salwar is also very popular. == Festivals == Punjabis celebrate cultural, seasonal and religious festivals, which include Maghi, Mela Chiraghan in Lahore, Lohri, Holi, Baisakhi, Teeyan, Diwali, Dussehra, and Guru Nanak Jayant. ==Gallery== File:Punjabi boys in their traditional dress.jpgPunjabi boys in traditional kurta-chadra File:On Youth Festival Punjabi Culteral ActivityBy Stundents At Punjab University Constitute Colleg Patto Hira Singh Moga Punjab India.jpgPunjabi girl in traditional Lehenga File:Punjabi Girls ( Students).jpgPunjabi charkha File:Punjabi Girl.jpgPunjabi girl in Salwar kameez File:Traditional punjabi get up.jpgPunjabi Turban ==See also== *Punjab Culture Day *Punjab region *Punjabi people *List of British Punjabis *Punjab (India) *Punjab (Pakistan) *List of Punjabi language poets *Punjabi Cultural Society of Chicago *Turban training centre ==ReferencesOtherces== *Wrestling in Punjab, documentary film on the history of wrestling in Punjab by filmmaker Simran Kaler. *Quraishee 73, Punjabi Adab De Kahani, Abdul Hafeez Quaraihee, Azeez Book Depot, Lahore, 1973. *Chopra 77, The Punjab as a sovereign state, Gulshan Lal Chopra, Al-Biruni, Lahore, 1977. *Patwant Singh. 1999.

The plans called for a freeway extending from Route 23 in Butler, across the state to Bergen County, where it would cross over a new Hudson River crossing near Alpine. From there, the highway continue as an extension of the Cross County Parkway in Yonkers, New York. The proposal was submitted to the Federal Highway Administration for possible interstate status in 1970, but opposition from Bergen and Westchester County residents along with the engineering difficulties involved with building the proposed Hudson River bridge atop the New Jersey Palisades prevented the freeway from being built. ==Route description== The area of the western terminus for Route 14 in the area of Butler as viewed by OpenStreetMap Route 14 was to begin at New Jersey Route 23 (which was to be converted to a freeway) and Kiel Avenue in the community of Butler in Morris County. The route was to head eastward from Butler, following a four-lane freeway for to an interchange with Interstate 287 at Milepost 54 in Bloomingdale. The route was to be concurrent with Interstate 287 through the northern portions of Morris County and entering Passaic County towards Interchange 59, where it would follow current-day New Jersey Route 208 through Franklin Lakes in Bergen County. Route 14 was to continue for the next two miles on current-day Route 208 before forking to the northeast. From there, the highway would continue eastward through Wyckoff, Ridgewood, Oradell, New Milford, Cresskill, and into Alpine, where it would reach the Hudson River and continue in New York as the Cross County Parkway. ==History== While Interstate 80 was being constructed during the 1960s, the New Jersey State Highway Department started conceiving plans to construct another east-west link across New Jersey. In 1969, the now- Department of Transportation brought forth plans for a new freeway from New Jersey Route 23 and Interstate 287 near Butler, heading eastward through Morris, Passaic and Bergen Counties to a new bridge crossing over the Hudson River at Alpine. Although the freeway was a brand new proposal, this was not the first time a freeway through northern Bergen County has been conceived. The Tri-State Transportation Commission also proposed extending New Jersey Route 19 from Paterson to Alpine, where a bridge would be constructed. The bridge would relieve the rising amount of traffic on the nearby Tappan Zee and George Washington Bridges. On the Westchester side of the river, the Cross County Parkway was to be built and extended two miles to the bridge approach for opening to commercial traffic. Rumors indicated that Route 14 would possibly be extended westward from Butler to the vicinity of a proposed national recreation area along the Delaware River that would have been built in conjunction with the controversial Tocks Island Dam project. Also in the meantime, Butler officials along with their mayor, opposed widening of Route 23 through the community. In 1970, the states of New York and New Jersey began to pursue getting the portion of Route 14 and the Cross County from Franklin Lakes to Yonkers for interstate status, but financial issues, public opposition in Bergen and Westchester Counties along with design problems helped kill the freeway. ==Exit listlso== * * *New Jersey Route 11 *New Jersey Route 60 == References  *Proposed NJ 14 History from Steve Alpert 014 014 014 014 ","title":"New Jersey Route 14"},{"id":"6237457","text":"Treaty of Hellgate Monument at Council Grove State Park The Treaty of Hellgate was signed in Hellgate on July 16, 1855 between Indian commissioner Isaac Stevens and the Native American tribes located in western Montana.

The tribes negotiated the Hellgate treaty with the United States in 1855. Based on the terms of the accord, the Native Americans were to relinquish their territories to the United States government in exchange for payment installments that totaled $120,000 dollars. The territories in question entailed everything from the main ridge of the Rocky Mountains at the 49th parallel to the Kootenai River and Clark Fork to the divide between the St. Regis River and the Coeur d'Alene River. From there, the ceded territories also extend to the southwestern fork of the Bitterroot River and up to Salmon River and Snake River. The Flathead Indian Reservation was established by the treaty.

The hard-swinging, bluesy transition style is bracketed by Count Basie who in 1929 signed with the Bennie Moten's Kansas City Orchestra and Kansas City native Charlie Parker who ushered in the Bebop style in America. \\"While New Orleans was the birthplace of jazz, America's music grew up in Kansas City\\". Kansas City is known as one of the most popular \\"cradles of jazz\\". Other cities include New Orleans, Chicago, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and New York City. Kansas City was known for the organized musicians of the Local 627 A.F.M., which controlled a number of venues in the city.https://library2.umkc.edu/spec-col/local627/index.htm ==Background== The first band from Kansas City to acquire a national reputation was the Coon-Sanders Original Nighthawk Orchestra, a white group which broadcast nationally in the 1920s. However, the Kansas City jazz school is identified with the black bands of the 1920s and 1930s, including those led by Bennie Moten, Andy Kirk, Harlan Leonard, George E. Lee, Count Basie, and Jay McShann.Driggs and Haddix, 2006 Kansas City in the 1930s was very much the crossroads of the United States resulting in a mix of cultures. Transcontinental trips at the time, whether by plane or train, often necessitated a stop in the city. The era marked the zenith of power of political boss Tom Pendergast. Kansas City was a wide open town with liquor laws and hours totally ignored and was called the new Storyville. Most of the jazz musicians associated with the style were born in other places but got caught up in the friendly musical competitions among performers that could keep a single song being performed in variations for an entire night. Often members of the big bands would perform at regular venues earlier in the evening and go to the jazz clubs later to jam for the rest of the night. Jay McShann told the Associated Press in 2003: > \\"You'd hear some cat play, and somebody would say 'This cat, he sounds like > he is from Kansas City.' It was Kansas City Style. They knew it on the East > Coast. They knew it on the West Coast. They knew it up North and they knew > it down South.\\" Claude \\"Fiddler\\" Williams described the scene: > Kansas City was different from all other places because we'd be jamming all > night. And [if] you come up here ... playing the wrong thing, we'd > straighten you out. Clubs were scattered throughout city but the most fertile area was the inner city neighborhood of 18th Street and Vine. Among the clubs were the Amos 'n' Andy, Boulevard Lounge, Cherry Blossom, Chesterfield Club, Chocolate Bar, Dante's Inferno, Elk's Rest, Hawaiian Gardens, Hell's Kitchen, the Hi Hat, the Hey Hay Club, Lone Star, Old Kentucky Bar-B-Que, Paseo Ballroom, Pla-Mor Ballroom, Reno Club, Spinning Wheel, Street's Blue Room, Subway, and Sunsetx. Kansas City influence overtly transferred to the national scene in 1936 when record producer John Hammond discovered Count Basie on his car radio. Pendergast was convicted of income tax fraud in 1940 and the city cracked down on the clubs effectively ending the era. ==Style== Kansas City jazz is distinguished by the following musical elements: * A preference for a 4 feel (walking) over the 2 beat feel found in other jazz styles of the time. As a result, Kansas city jazz had a more relaxed, fluid sound than other jazz styles. * Extended soloing. Fueled by the non-stop nightlife under political boss Tom Pendergast, Kansas City jam sessions continued until later than sunrise, fostering a highly competitive atmosphere and a unique jazz culture in which the goal was to \\"say something\\" with one's instrument, rather than simply show off one's technique. It was not uncommon for one \\"song\\" to be performed for several hours, with the best musicians often soloing for dozens of choruses at a time. * So-called \\"head arrangements\\". The KC big bands often played by memory, composing and arranging the music collectively, rather than sight-reading as other big bands of the time did. This further contributed to the loose, spontaneous Kansas City sound. * A heavy blues influence, with KC songs often based around a 12-bar blues structure, rather than the 32 bar AABA standard, although Moten Swing is in this AABA format. * One of the most recognizable characteristics of Kansas City jazz is frequent, elaborate riffing by the different sections. Riffs were often created - or even improvised - collectively, and took many forms: a) one section riffing alone, serving as the main focus of the music; b) one section riffing behind a soloist, adding excitement to the song; or c) two or more sections riffing in counterpoint, creating an exciting hard-swinging sound. The Count Basie signature tunes \\"One O'Clock Jump\\" and \\"Jumpin' at the Woodside\\", for example, are simply collections of complex riffs, memorized in a head arrangement, and punctuated with solos. Glenn Miller's famous swing anthem \\"In the Mood\\" closely follows the Kansas City pattern of riffing sections, and is a good example of the Kansas City style after it had been exported to the rest of the world. ==Aftermath== Beginning in the 1970s, Kansas City has attempted to celebrate the heritage by taking off the rough edges for family friendly environments. In the 1970s, the city tried to create a jazz enclave in the River Quay area on the Missouri River in the City Market neighborhood. Three of the clubs were bombed during a mob war that ultimately also led to the demise of mob influence of Las Vegas casinos that was depicted in the 1995 movie Casino. In 1979, Bruce Ricker filmed The Last of the Blue Devils, a documentary starring Basie and singer Big Joe Turner, and featuring many performers from the original era. In 1981 114 people died in the Hyatt Regency walkway collapse in an attempted recreation of the jazz scene during a tea dance. In 1996 Kansas City native Robert Altman released the film Kansas City depicting the Kansas City jazz era. In 1997 the American Jazz Museum opened in the 18th and Vine neighborhood with a mission of celebrating Kansas City's jazz heritage. Each year Kansas City celebrates \\"Jazzoo\\" - a charity fundraiser dedicated to Kansas City jazz and raising funds for the Kansas City Zoo. In 2011, Jazzoo was one of the Nation's largest charity fundraisers, raising over $800,000. Regardless of the history of Jazz, there are no dedicated Jazz radio stations broadcasting in the Kansas City metropolitan area today. In 2003 the Kansas City Jazz Orchestra is formed and begins a regular fall - spring concert season. The band celebrates many styles of jazz while also bringing some of Kansas City's own flavor to the music. They currently perform most of their concerts at the Kauffman Center of the Performing Arts. In October 2017, Kansas City, Missouri was designated a \\"Creative City\\" by UNESCO for its contributions to music. ==Musiciansted discography== Early jazz and swing era music: *Various artists, The Real Kansas City of the 20's, 30's & 40's, Columbia/Legacy (1996) *Various artists, Jazz - Kansas City Style, Topaz Jazz/Pearl (1996) *Various artists, The Cradle of Jazz, The International Music Co.

Cotter is a fireboat in use by the Buffalo Fire Department at Buffalo, New York, United States. Originally named William S. Grattan, she was built in 1900 by the Crescent Shipyard of Elizabeth Port, New Jersey. Due to age she was rebuilt in 1953 and renamed Firefighter upon her return to service. The following year she was renamed Edward M. Cotter. Her namesake, Edward Cotter, was a Buffalo firefighter and leader of the local firefighters union who had recently died. Edward M. Cotter is considered to be the oldest active fireboat in the world and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1996. and Along with her firefighting duties, during the winter Edward M. Cotter is used as an icebreaker on Buffalo's rivers. Edward M. Cotter mounts five fire monitors that are capable of pumping . She can often be seen sailing out of her berth and south-west to Lake Erie, returning north through the breakwall and firing her fire monitors. ==Construction== 190px The ship that was to become Edward M. Cotter was built in 1900 by the Crescent Shipyard of Elizabeth Port, New Jersey. She was originally named William S. Grattan after the first paid fire commissioner for the city of Buffalo. Construction was started on March 24, 1900 and she was christened on September 5, 1900 by Virginia Pearson, the young daughter of one of the city's fire commissioners. The final construction cost for the ship was $91,000. The completed ship was in length, had a beam of , and drew . A -thick belt-line of Swedish steel was included around the hull for icebreaking duties. William S. Grattan was powered by two Babcock & Wilcox coal-fired boilers with steam engines rated at . (identified as William S. Gratton) A single propeller provided propulsion. The rated speed of the ship was . The ship was also equipped with three double action steam pumps that supplied water at to the three fire monitors used for firefighting. Two of the fire monitors were mounted on the forward section of the ship and one was on the stern section. ==History== At the beginning of the twentieth century, Buffalo's waterfront was an extremely busy center of commerce. Grain elevators, warehouses and shipping traffic had overtaxed the two existing fireboats: John T. Hutchinson (Engine 23) and George R. Potter (Engine 29). Also, the city of Buffalo had shoreline hookups to allow the fireboats to serve as floating pumping stations supplying high pressure water to a fire hydrant system that covered the downtown area. The decision was made by city officials to order a third boat that would also have icebreaking capability along with her normal firefighting duties. Upon completion she traveled up the Atlantic coast, down the St. Lawrence River, across Lake Ontario, through the Welland Canal and finally across Lake Erie in an uneventful trip that took 14 days. She was met out of the harbor by her sister fireboats and escorted in. ===1928 fire=== On July 28, 1928 William S. Grattan responded to the oil barge James F. Cahill, loaded with 5,000 barrels of crude oil, that was aflame. After burning 17 hours, the barge's mooring lines gave way and the barge began to drift. William S. Grattans crew attempted to attach tow lines to the drifting barge but it struck a dock at an oil company where the empty oil tanker B.B. McColl was moored. The fumes on the B.B. McColl ignited causing an explosion and fire that engulfed William S. Grattan. Captain Thomas Hylant along with his crew abandoned ship and swam through the flames to shore. Chief Engineer Thomas Lynch of William S. Grattan lost his life and seven other crew members were injured. The unattended boilers on William S. Grattan soon ran dry and exploded, leaving the ship burned out and heavily damaged. William S. Grattan sat boarded-up for eighteen months while city and fire department officials decided whether to replace her at a cost of $225,000 or rebuild her for $99,000, which was $8,000 more than her original cost. The decision was made to rebuild and in 1930 she was rebuilt at the Buffalo Dry Dock Company of Buffalo, New York. During this refit some improvements were made to William S. Grattan. One improvement was that her boilers were converted from burning coal to burning oil. The engines were rebuilt and her firefighting system was updated and could now handle foam fire retardant. Also, the pilot house was raised to the upper boat deck level and a fixed turret tower with a fire monitor was constructed on the stern of the ship. A fourth fire monitor was added to the top of the pilot house of the ship as well. As part of her acceptance ceremony she participated in a race against the harbor tug Kentucky, which was considered to be one of the fastest tugs on the Great Lakes. ===1953 refit=== In the early 1950s, it was noticed that William S. Grattan was showing signs of age. Her boilers were only able to operate at 40 percent capacity and an engine room steam leak in 1951 injured part of her crew. During November 1952, William S. Grattan was sent to the Sturgeon Bay Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company of Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin for a refit. During this refit her boilers and steam engines were replaced by diesel engines, the pumps for the firefighting system were replaced, the single propeller was replaced with twin propellers, the fixed firefighting platform was replaced with a hydraulically operated platform and the twin funnels were replaced with lower dummy funnels. Upon her return in 1954, she was renamed Firefighter. In 1955 she was renamed again in honor of Edward M. Cotter, a respected Buffalo firefighter and the leader of the local firefighters union, who had recently died. After the refit Edward M. Cotter mounted five fire monitors capable of pumping . ===International firefighting=== Edward M. Cotter with her station house in the background On October 7, 1960 Edward M. Cotter came to the aid of firefighting authorities in Port Colborne, Ontario, Canada. Two days previously, on October 5, 1960, a set of grain elevators caught fire at the eight-story Maple Leaf Milling Company. The Port Colborne Fire Department did not have its own fireboat and they were unable to bring the fire under control. The Buffalo Fire Department was asked to send Edward M. Cotter to lend assistance. Escorted by a United States Coast Guard cutter, because she had never needed navigational equipment of her own, Edward M. Cotter proceeded across the international border. The voyage to Port Colborne took two hours with an additional four hours needed to bring the fire under control. This mission is said to have been the first instance that a United States fire boat had crossed an international border to help authorities in another country. ===Notable rescues=== In 1978 , a retired United States Naval guided missile cruiser on display at the Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park, began taking on water and listing. Edward M. Cotter and several Buffalo Fire Department fire engines pumped water out of Little Rock for five days keeping the ship afloat and level while repairs were made. Edward M. Cotter also assisted the disabled United States Coast Guard cutter Ojibwa during the winter of 1983. Ojibwa, while on Lake Erie, had lost her steering and was taking on water. Edward M. Cotter towed Ojibwa to her base in Buffalo and helped keep her afloat while repairs were made. Another rescue occurred on July 31, 1984 when Edward M. Cotter towed the Polish tall ship Zawisza Czarny off a sand bar during the ship's visit to Buffalo. ==Heritage== As commerce declined on Buffalo's waterfront, Edward M. Cotter was transferred from the Buffalo Fire Department to the Public Works Department in 1992 for icebreaking duties. In 1996 Edward M. Cotter was designated a National Historic Landmark. and was transferred back to the Buffalo Fire Department in 1997. A non-profit group named \\"Friends of the Cotter\\", founded in 2005, has been running fund-raising events to overhaul Edward M. Cotter. Along with her normal duties Edward M. Cotter has been sent to various festivals and boat shows around the Great Lakes. ==Other fire boats== Edward Cotter is one of a few fireboats to ply the Great Lakes: * William Lyon Mackenzie is operated by Toronto Fire Service and operates in Lake Ontario. * Curtis Randolph is operated by Detroit Fire Department and operates in the Detroit River ==See also== * List of National Historic Landmarks in New York *List of U.S. National Historic Landmark ships, shipwrecks, and shipyards * History of Buffalo, New York * * * ==References * *History of the E.

Tyler Legacy High School has served the East Texas community since opening in 1958 and classified as a 6A school by the UIL. In 2013, the school was rated \\"Met Standard\\" by the Texas Education Agency. ==History== There was a debate in the Tyler community in 2017–2018 on whether the school's name should change, as Robert E. Lee became a controversial figure. In 2018 the district's board decided not to vote on a possible renaming, so the school kept its name. On July 16, 2020 the school board voted unanimously to initiate changing the name of both Robert E. Lee High School and John Tyler High School. ==Tradition== In the 1960s, when Lee's mascot was the Rebel, the school was famous for its working cannon and oversized Confederate flag. A group of seniors tended the cannon at games, firing it when the Rebel football team scored a touchdown. The football team entered Rose Stadium by running under the flag, reputed to be the second largest Confederate flag in the world (second only to one owned by the University of Mississippi). By 1972, the flag was retired and its whereabouts are unknown. The flag was retired shortly after four African- American players refused to run under the flag and ran around it instead, causing some local controversy.

The gray shaded areas within the Unique Area boundaries are privately owned. American beachgrass is growing in the foreground; the walkway protects this beachgrass from beachgoers. The trees to the left are Eastern cottonwoods, which are the main dune-forming tree in this region. Sandy Island Beach State Park is a New York State park on the eastern shore of Lake Ontario. Its highlight is a natural sandy beach. The park is near the southern end of a notable length of sandy shoreline, coastal dunes, and wetlands (the Eastern Lake Ontario Dunes and Wetlands); a 1959 study noted that \\"The eastern end of Lake Ontario contains not only the finest beaches on the entire lake but also the finest wildlife habitat.\\" The park's facilities include several lake swimming areas with lifeguards (in season), changing rooms and restrooms, and a concession stand; a parking fee is charged through the summer season. The park averages about 30,000 recorded visits each season. Prior to 2011, the park's area totaled . At that time, the adjacent Sandy Island Beach Unique Area was a conservation area administered by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. The Unique Area incorporated several additional acres of land near the park as well as most of the southern end of North Sandy Pond. In 2011, administration and ownership of both the Sandy Island Beach Unique Area and the nearby Sandy Pond Beach Unique Area were transferred to the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation to be incorporated into Sandy Island Beach State Park. As of 2014, the park covers a total of in the Town of Richland in Oswego County. ==\\"The hottest spot on the shoreline\\"== In the 1950s, Sandy Island Beach was opened as a private beach resort by LeGrande and Eva Smith. The resort became very popular. As Jack Major described it, \\"Overnight, Sandy Pond Beach – renamed Sandy Island Beach – became the place to go\\". The webpage is part of a larger website that describes one family's experiences at Sandy Pond over 80 years. Ed Wyroba recalled that, through the 1960s, \\"it was the hottest spot on the shoreline. All our parents had gone there.\\" Following LeGrande Smith's death in 1966 and a decline in its popularity, the resort was closed in the early 1970s. The condition of the area deteriorated, which led to public discussions in 1976 of its possible purchase by Oswego County. In 1980, of the resort were purchased from the Smiths by Ed Wyroba and Dyke Riggs. They reopened the resort in 1981, and operated it until 1991. In 1999, The Nature Conservancy stepped in to help protect the property. In partnership with Oswego County and the State of New York, the Central & Western New York Chapter of The Nature Conservancy acquired the remaining from the Riggs' heirs. The Conservancy then conveyed on the beachfront to Oswego County for a park; were purchased from the Conservancy by New York State for the Unique Area.Oswego County real estate transaction records for parcel 027.14-01-01.2 (Unique Area) and parcel 027.13-01-01 (State Park). Online versions accessed 2009-01-26. Oswego County operated the beach resort for several years and built a new bathhouse, picnic pavilions, and a boardwalk. In 2005, the County Park was transferred to the New York State Park system, which operates it. ==\\"The dune is moving\\"== North and south of Sandy Island Beach, the shoreline has high dunes that are up to higher than the level of Lake Ontario. Despite the fact that the high dunes are essentially pure sand, hardwood trees such as red oak and red maple grow on them. The forested high dunes are one of the unusual features of the eastern Lake Ontario coastline. It can take 400 years for a hardwood forest to become established on a freshly formed dune. One high dune just north of the present boundary of Sandy Island Beach State Park is an example of the rapid changes that are possible in a sandy landscape. Jack Major wrote that \\"For many years the most popular spot on the beach was an open-faced sandhill that overlooked North Pond.\\" The topographic map from 1958 (see illustration and the annotation \\"lost sandhill\\") indicates that this dune was at least above lake level. In 1981, a \\"monster\\" dune was reported by a local newspaper as moving towards Sandy Pond. The sandhill described by Major is much lower than it was in the 1970s; it has become a \\"low dune\\". Stable coastal dunes and sandhills are structures created by dune-building plants such as beachgrass and cottonwood trees. The loss of the high dune appears to have been the result of the destruction of its vegetation that occurred over the years, and in particular during the 1970s. At that time the area around Sandy Island Beach was privately owned, but wasn't staffed, occupied, or maintained. In 1982, Dyke Riggs described the situation, \\"Bonfires fueled by trees on the beach and dune buggies, trucks and three-wheeled motorcycles careening around destroyed growth that holds the sand.\\" Since 2000, the dune overlooking Sandy Island Beach was partially rebuilt and replanted with beachgrass by New York State. At the nearby Sandy Pond Beach Unique Area, about 1–2 miles north of Sandy Island Beach, replanting has led to regrowth of low sand dunes. Despite this success, natural regrowth of the full height of high dunes is thought to be unlikely. Robert Davis and Sandra Bonanno have written that \\"conditions no longer exist for the maintenance of high dunes - at least half of the high dunes at Sandy Pond have been reworked into low dunes since the time of the French traders.\\"The eastern Lake Ontario high dunes are apparently relics of the era when the lake level was perhaps lower than at present, which is also the era in which the present ponds were river mouths. Presumably, there was much more blowing sand at that time, permitting the dunes to grow fairly tall. The amount of sand that blows annually onto the coastal dunes appears to be insufficient to feed the growth of high dunes. ==ReferencesCategory:State parks of New York (state) Category:Parks in Oswego County, New York ","title":"Sandy Island Beach State Park"},{"id":"6237539","text":"Belhadj or Belhaj may refer to: * Abdelhakim Belhadj, the emir of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group * Ahlem Belhadj, Tunisian psychiatrist and activist * Ali Belhadj, Vice-President of the Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria * , Moroccan politician * Nadir Belhadj (b. 1982), Algerian professional football player ","title":"Belhadj"},{"id":"6237542","text":"Keith Alexander (November 23, 1963 – July 11, 2005) was a guitarist, cyclist and body modification enthusiast. ==Career== Keith Alexander was the guitarist for the thrash metal band Carnivore, on whose first album he played.

Retrieved 2010-09-01. ==History== During 2001 while conversing with a group of people involved in the sport, longtime motorsports journalist Bill Holder decided to create the National Dirt Late Model Hall of Fame. The first induction ceremony took place later in August at Florence Speedway during their annual NORTH- SOUTH 100. ==Induction process== Within the NDLMHOF, there are three types of inductees, each of which contributes to the sport in a different manner. The types are Drivers, Contributors, and the Sportsman Award. All of the inductees are elected by the vote of a Hall of Fame Voting Board on candidates that have been submitted. The voting board consists of voters from all aspects of the Dirt Late Model scene. The general requirements for the drivers are that they must have at least 30 years in the sport or are retired. Although it was initially required for all drivers to be retired, that no longer is a constraint because experience has shown that many of them never retire. Normally, six (unless a tie) are taken from this category. The Contributor category includes individuals from all aspects of the sport including promoters, series directors, car builders, engine builders, crew chiefs, car owners, media types, etc. This category provides two inductees. Finally, there is the Sportsman Award category which inducts one active driver. This inductee, who is also voted on by the Voting Board is an individual who supports the Dirt Late Model sport by working closely with promoters, track owners, sanctioning body heads, helps young and inexperienced drivers, and maybe most importantly, interfaces with the fans. This category is done completely by the Voting Board who both nominates the candidates and then selects the winner. ==List of inductees 2001–2005 === ;2001 Drivers: * Jack Boggs2010 NDLMHoF Class Inducted/Hommel Honored With Hall's Spirit Award (August 26, 2010).

These cells are known to initiate mucosal immunity responses on the apical membrane of the M cells and allow for transport of microbes and particles across the epithelial cell layer from the gut lumen to the lamina propria where interactions with immune cells can take place. Unlike their neighbor cells, M cells have the unique ability to take up antigen from the lumen of the small intestine via endocytosis, phagocytosis, or transcytosis. Antigens are delivered to antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, and B lymphocytes. M cells express the protease cathepsin E, similar to other antigen-presenting cells. This process takes place in a unique pocket-like structure on their basolateral side. Antigens are recognized via expression of cell surface receptors such as glycoprotein-2 (GP2) that detect and specifically bind to bacteria. Cellular prion protein (PrP) is another example of a cell surface receptor on M cells. M cells lack microvilli but, like other epithelial cells, they are characterized by strong cell junctions. This provides a physical barrier that constitutes an important line of defense between the gut contents and the immune system of the host. Despite the epithelial barrier, some antigens are able to infiltrate the M cell barrier and infect the nearby epithelial cells or enter the gut. ==Structure== M cells are distinguished from other intestinal epithelial cells by their morphological differences. They are characterized by their short microvilli or lack of these protrusions on the cell surface. When they present microvilli, they are short, irregular, and present on the apical surface or pocket-like invagination on the basolateral surface of these cells. When they lack microvilli, they are characterized by their microfolds, and hence receive their commonly known name. These cells are far less abundant than enterocytes. These cells can also be identified by cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix components expressed at the edge of cells or on their cell surfaces, such as actin, villin, cytokeratin, and vimentin. ==Development== Factors promoting the differentiation of M cells have yet to be elucidated, but they are thought to develop in response to signals from immune cells found in developing Peyer's patches. Link B cells have been implicated in the developmental of M cells, since they are also localized in high numbers in the follicular- associated epithelium (FAE). FAE lacking B cell populations results in a decrease in the number of M cell lining the Peyer's patches. Similarly, a human lymphoma cell line is also known to undergo transition from adenocarcinoma cells to M cells. Though many studies have shown various cell types directing the differentiation of M cells, new research characterizes the molecular pathways that guide M cell differentiation. More recently, through loss-of-function and rescue-phenotype studies, RANKL is shown to be a receptor activator of NF-κB ligand and play a role in differentiation of M cells. RANKL is expressed throughout the small intestine, facilitates uptake of pathogens such as Salmonella, and is the most critical factor M cell differentiation. Microbes found on intestinal epithelium are known to direct M cell development. For example, the type III secretion system effector protein SopB activates the transition of M cells from enterocytes. M cells undergo the differentiation process for up to four days before reaching full maturation. Recent studies have suggested they arise distinctly from the lymphoid and myeloid lineages. Pathogens can take advantage of cell differentiation pathways in order to invade host cells. This is done by inducing differentiation of enterocytes into M cell type in gut epithelium. In one case, the SopB effector protein mentioned above is secreted to trigger fast differentiation of enterocytes localized in the FAE by initiation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition in these cells. When SopB activates differentiation of enterocytes, it acts via the activation of the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway and triggers the RANKL and its receptor, implicated in regulating cell apoptosis. ==Function== M cells do not secrete mucus or digestive enzymes, and have a thinner glycocalyx, which allows them to have easy access to the intestinal lumen for endocytosis of antigens. The main function of M cells is the selective endocytosis of antigens, and transporting them to intraepithelial macrophages and lymphocytes, which then migrate to lymph nodes where an immune response can be initiated.Kenneth M., Murphy (2012). Janeway's Immunobiology. Garland Science. ===Passive immunity=== M cells play a role in passive immunity, or the transfer of active humoral immunity during and post pregnancy. Infants rely on antibodies specific to their mother's intestinal antigens, which move from the mother's gut and enter the breast milk. These antibodies are able to move into the milk supply through the lymphatic system. Even though the mechanism of this transport is not fully understood, it is hypothesized that dendritic cells and macrophages play the role of transport vehicles. In females that are not lactating, when M cells recognize antigen in the gut, they stimulate production of many Immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies. These antibodies are released into the gut mucosa, salivary glands, and lymph nodes. However, in females that are lactating, M cells recognize antigen and IgA is directed from the gut to the mammary gland. IgA traveling from the gut to breast milk supply is controlled by hormones, chemokines, and cytokines. Thus, the mammary gland and breast milk have critical roles alongside M cells in mucosal immune system. ==Clinical significance== M cells are exploited by several pathogenic gram-negative bacteria including Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, as well as infectious prions, such as in bovine spongiform encephalitis (Mad-cow disease), as a way of penetrating the intestinal epithelium. Exploitation as a virulence factor depends upon the pathogen's ability to bind to M cells and thus guarantee penetration in that manner, as M cells sample intestinal contents. EPEC (see Pathogenic Escherichia coli) containing plasmids with genes for EAF (Escherichia coli adherence factor) will adhere to M cells. They are also exploited by viruses such as Polio and Reovirus for dissemination. CXCR4 tropic but not CCR5 tropic HIV has been noted to be able to bind to M cells and get transported across the epithelium by them. == See also == *List of human cell types derived from the germ layers == References  * Slide at ucsd.edu Category:Immune system Category:Animal cells Category:Human cells Category:Digestive system ","title":"Microfold cell"},{"id":"6237586","text":"Tomorrow's Yesterday is a short film written and directed by Elan Gale.

The human sialyltransferase family.Biochimie. 2001 Aug;83(8):727-37 Each sialyltransferase is specific for a particular sugar substrate. Sialyltransferases add sialic acid to the terminal portions of the sialylated glycolipids (gangliosides) or to the N- or O-linked sugar chains of glycoproteins. The biosynthesis of disaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides involves the action of hundreds of different glycosyltransferases. These enzymes catalyse the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules, forming glycosidic bonds. A classification of glycosyltransferases using nucleotide diphospho-sugar, nucleotide monophospho-sugar and sugar phosphates () and related proteins into distinct sequence based families has been described. This classification is available on the CAZy (CArbohydrate-Active EnZymes) web site. The same three-dimensional fold is expected to occur within each of the families. Because 3-D structures are better conserved than sequences, several of the families defined on the basis of sequence similarities may have similar 3-D structures and therefore form 'clans'. Sialyltransferases belong to glycosyltransferase family 29 (CAZY GT_29) which comprises enzymes with a number of known activities; sialyltransferase (), beta-galactosamide alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase (), alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminide alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase (), beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase (), N-acetyllactosaminide alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase (), alpha-N-acetyl- neuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase (); lactosylceramide alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase (). These enzymes use a nucleotide monophosphosugar as the donor (CMP-NeuA) instead of a nucleotide diphosphosugar. Sialyltransferase may be responsible for the synthesis of the sequence NEUAC-Alpha-2,3-GAL-Beta-1,3-GALNAC-, found on sugar chains O-linked to thr or ser and also as a terminal sequence on certain gangliosides. These enzymes catalyse sialyltransfer reactions during glycosylation, and are type II membrane proteins. There are about twenty different sialyltransferases which can be distinguished on the basis of the acceptor structure on which they act and on the type of sugar linkage they form. For example, a group of sialyltransferases adds sialic acid with an alpha-2,3 linkage to galactose, while other sialyltransferases add sialic acid with an alpha-2,6 linkage to galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine. A peculiar type of sialyltransferases add sialic acid to other sialic acid units with an alpha-2,8 linkage, forming structures referred to as polysialic acid. As occurs for other glycosyltransferases, the expression of sialyltransferases undergoes profound modifications during cell differentiation and neoplastic transformation; in some cases such changes induce phenotypic alterations.Dall'Olio and Chiricolo, Glycoconjugate J. 18 841-850, 2001 ==Human proteins containing this domain == SIAT4C; SIAT9; ST3GAL1; ST3GAL2; ST3GAL3; ST3GAL4; ST3GAL5; ST3GAL6; ST3GalIII; ST6GAL1; ST6GAL2; ST6Gal; ST8SIA1; ST8SIA2; ST8SIA3; ST8SIA4; ST8SIA5; ST8SIA6; ST8Sia; ==Referenceser reading== * ==External links== * Category:Transferases Category:EC 2.4 ","title":"Sialyltransferase"},{"id":"6237676","text":"A model of Fort San Salvador Santísima Trinidad (meaning \\"Holy Trinity\\") was a bay on the northeast coast of Taiwan at Keelung, where in 1626 the Spanish established a settlement and built Fort San Salvador.

The band was founded by Englishman Eamon McLoughlin and Australians Kym Warner and Carol Young. The musicians originally performed in local Austin bars, and soon found increasing acclaim. They have released one independent album, Movin' On, in 2003, and two albums, Weather and Water and Viridian, on the Dualtone record label. Their fourth album, Fascination, was released on Sugar Hill in 2009. Their fifth album, The Brick Album (2011), was self-produced with the direct support of their fans. Pre-production donors were recognized with their names inscribed on the \\"bricks\\" that make up the cover art. Their debut album, Movin' On, was the recipient of local Texas awards and charted on Americana radio stations. Country Music Television named their follow-up Weather and Water as one of the ten best bluegrass albums of 2005, and The Greencards were invited to tour with Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson in the same year. Viridian would go on to take the number one position on Billboard magazine's Bluegrass Music Chart, making the Greencards the first international band to do so. Viridian was a critically praised album, and was nominated for Best Country Album by the Australian Recording Industry Association. The track \\"Mucky the Duck\\" from Viridian was nominated as the Best Country Instrumental Performance at the 50th Grammy Awards. The Greencards are noted for their incorporation of other genres of music within an American bluegrass sound. Often labeled as part of, and said to be representative of, the \\"newgrass\\" movement, they draw from Irish folk music, gypsy music, rock 'n' roll, folk balladry, and Latin American musical sources. The Greencards' sound has been compared to progressive American folk rock, and they have been credited with helping to expand bluegrass music. Eamon McLoughlin left the band in December 2009, and resides in Nashville. Carl Miner, originally from Oregon, joined the group in May 2010, playing acoustic guitar. Miner won the 1999 National Flatpicking Championship at the Walnut Valley Festival, and he resides in Nashville. == History  Formation === The Greencards were initially composed of two Australians, Kym Warner on mandolin and Carol Young on bass, and an Englishman, Eamon McLoughlin on fiddle. Raised in South London, McLoughlin began to perform country music shows with his family on weekends, influenced by George Jones, George Strait, and Ricky Skaggs. Born to Irish parents, McLoughlin's father was head of a London-based country band. At age nine, McLoughlin moved away from piano lessons to play fiddle, and performed with his father's band. McLoughlin had earlier relocated from Brighton to Austin in 1997, after leaving the University of Sussex with a degree in Politics and American Studies. Trained in London studying Royal Schools of Music Grades before emigrating, McLoughlin also toured with the Asylum Street Spankers, Austin Lounge Lizards, Bruce Robison and Ray Wylie Hubbard after arriving in the United States. Prior to the founding of The Greencards, Young won the Australian Independent Country Artist of the Year award in 2000, and had recorded two No. 1 Australian-charted country music singles. Young was a singer in Outback country bands and acts, including Gina Jeffreys. Young was previously nominated as \\"Best Female Vocalist\\" by the Country Music Association of Australia, and won the Australian independent country artist of the year award in 2000 due in part to her No. 1 singles \\"True Blue Fool\\" and \\"Part of the Past\\". Warner was an aspiring bluegrass musician (which was unusual in Australia) after learning of the music from his father, an early Australian bluegrass pioneer. The winner of the Australian National Bluegrass Mandolin Championship for four consecutive years, Warner had toured with country music artists including Gina Jeffreys, and with Young in Kasey Chambers's band. Young and Warner knew each other previously, and according to Warner, had been drawn to bluegrass and American roots music through an appreciation of George Jones and Merle Haggard. Warner and Young made the decision to emigrate to America to pursue musical careers in that country, after they met. Young and Warner later lived together in Sydney while trying to find work in the moribund Australian bluegrass scene. After leaving Australia, they spent time in West Texas before relocating to Austin. On an early trip the pair took to Austin, Warner and Young met McLoughlin at a recording session. Warner was producing an album for the recording artist Bill Atkins and found they needed a fiddle player, which led to the recruitment of McLoughlin. Initially the immigrants came to know one another through their mutual love of Monty Python, Benny Hill, and Fawlty Towers. They began to have jam sessions afterwards and there was evident chemistry between the trio, which led to their writing songs together. They named themselves The Greencards in honor of the fact that all three band members carried United States green cards. They eventually began to perform shows locally in Austin to finance the recording of what would become their debut album, 2003's Movin' On. In the process, they became one of the most popular musical groups in Austin. Representative of an emerging \\"newgrass\\" movement, the Greencards' acoustic sound was said to incorporate eclectic influences from Irish traditional, Romani gypsy, and Latin American musical sources. Their first performance together as a band was at the Austin Irish pub Mother Egan's. Given a noon to 3 pm time slot, they began to fill the pub with patrons week after week. Their fans at Mother Egan's soon began calling them the \\"Bluegrass Bunch\\". Several months later, The Greencards began performing an additional three to five times per week in Austin, in addition to their Mother Egan's Sunday show. Warner credited the frantic pace of their performance schedule during their Austin formation to their cohesion as a group and with driving them to create more new original music. During their time performing locally in Austin, they toured with various local Texas musicians, including Robert Earl Keen. Warner said that during their early career performing together, audiences would always assume they were American musicians until they finally spoke between songs, revealing their English and Australian accents. Mario Tarradell of WFAA-TV news called the idea of an American bluegrass band composed of two Australians and an Englishman not as \\"outrageous\\" as it may seem. He quoted McLoughlin in an interview: > The ironic thing is that we grew up listening to primarily American music > and fell in love with American music. I love country music. I grew up with > George Jones and Charley Pride and Jim Reeves. All that stuff was playing in > the house. That's what I wanted to seek out. That's what I wanted to play. > Carol was into Tammy Wynette. Trev Warner is Kym's dad, and he was the first > person to bring bluegrass music to Australia. === Movin' On (2003–2004) === In 2003, The Greencards recorded and self- released Movin' On, their debut album, which sold 10,000 copies at shows and online, and entered the top five on the Americana radio charts. Pat Flynn, one of the band members of the New Grass Revival, guested on the recording of Movin' On as a session guitarist, and would return to do so again on Weather and Water. The album was said to break past traditional rules of bluegrass music by integrating a jam-band mindset while blending classical folk balladry and rock 'n' roll into the sound. Contrasting with that appraisal, the album was also cited as a traditional and successful \\"lo-fi\\" approach to bluegrass music. Critics noted the virtuoso solos on mandolin, fiddle, and guitar on Movin' On. The Greencards gained more fans and became known by name quickly after the release of Movin' On. The band was credited with performing the most energetic sets during the course of the 2004 Austin City Limits Music Festival, were said to bring a global sound to bluegrass, and—by drawing on influences such as Bob Dylan and The Beatles—were pushing the genre's boundaries. Their live show during this period was ranked by the Houston Chronicle in the top five nights of live music for the year in 2004. Movin' On earned The Greencards the 2004 Austin Music Award for Best New Band. Several months after the awards, the band was signed by Dualtone Records and began work on their next album, Weather and Water. The label re-released Movin' On at the beginning of 2005, generating still more airplay and sales. === Weather and Water (2005–2006) === Their second Dualtone album, Weather and Water, was released on June 28, 2005. Warned stated that during the recording sessions, Dualtone Records let them record what they wanted, with no interference or changes requested. In a review of Weather and Water in The Washington Post, it was noted that on this album, unlike their debut, the focus was on the music supporting lyrics, rather than the blues virtuosity of Movin' On. All three members of the band sang on Weather and Water, but Young's voice was noted for its \\"dreamy, haunting quality\\". Their music through the Weather and Water album had been called Celtic-influenced and bluegrass-flavored by John Lehndorff of the Rocky Mountain News, but he noted that the band had a distinctly American sound despite their overseas origins. In early 2005, The Greencards performed at South by Southwest in Austin for the first time, and afterwards made their debut at the prestigious MerleFest. Jason Gonulsen of Glide Magazine noted that The Greencards' debut Movin' On did not capture the band's live energy, but that Weather and Water overcame this, and was one of 2005's best bluegrass albums. The music video for the band's single \\"Time\\" from Weather and Water received heavy airplay and rotation on Country Music Television. \\"Time\\" was described as the centerpiece track of Weather and Water. Weather and Water was also cited as expanding the boundaries of the bluegrass genre. Country Music Television named Weather and Water one of its ten favorite bluegrass albums of the year, saying, \\"At the nexus of bluegrass, country and pop, this charming trio immediately win over such diverse audiences in concert. Luckily, their winning personality translates to this disc—even with several melancholy, yet melodic, songs. Not for nothing did Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson choose them to open their summer tour of minor league ballparks.\\" The Greencards were the opening act for Dylan and Nelson on their 2005 summer tour. Kym Warner credits Gary Paczosa, an engineer who worked on Weather and Water, with helping them get the opportunity to tour with Dylan and Nelson. Paczosa had previously served as an engineer on recordings for Alison Krauss, Nickel Creek and Dolly Parton. \\"He makes the best-sounding acoustic records in the world\\", according to Warner. Throughout 2005 they toured extensively with Dylan and Nelson, and afterwards toured with Tommy Emmanuel. During the summer segment of the 2005 tour with Nelson and Dylan, Warner wanted to have the opportunity to pick Dylan's brain about music and performing. However, Warner did not get to spend much time alone with Dylan during their time on the road together. Dylan later told Warner at the end of the tour, \\"You'll be fine from now on.\\" At the end of 2005, The Greencards relocated from Austin to Nashville, to be closer to their production company and its staff. Coinciding with their move to Nashville and work on their second album Weather and Water, the changes in location and sound were observed by critics to be a deliberate move from the jam-style of their debut album Movin' On to instead concentrate on Americana-focused music. By 2006, The Greencards had an annual slot at Merlefest, held yearly in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. The band was nominated in the Americana Music Association Awards for 2006 in the category of New/Emerging Artist of the Year, winning the award. In December 2006, their tour van rolled over on a patch of ice after leaving a performance in Bryan, Texas on the way back to Austin, but with no serious injuries. === Viridian (2007–2008) === The Greencards performing at The Mucky Duck, the inspiration for their Grammy-nominated song \\"Mucky the Duck\\" On their previous albums, The Greencards had individually recorded their musical tracks separately in isolation booths of recording studios. For Viridian, the band members recorded their album together in real time in an open room, which was said to be a factor in creating a spontaneous feel for some of the album. Most of the songs on Viridian are sung by Young, and all of the tracks were written by The Greencards, with the exception of \\"Travel On\\", which was penned by Kim Richey of Nashville. Their sound, through Viridian, was likened to the Canadian alternative country band The Duhks. After its release, Viridian claimed the No. 1 position on Billboard magazine's Bluegrass Music Chart. Doug Lancio, a producer who had previously worked with Patty Griffin, was said to have been a positive factor in the success of Viridian. Prior to the 2007 album, Lancio had not worked with The Greencards. The Greencards are the first international musical act to reach No. 1 on the Bluegrass Music Chart. In a review of Viridian, Embo Blake of Hybrid Magazine noted Carol Young's vocal skill, as she \\"effortlessly diphthongs cadence\\" on the track \\"Waiting On The Night\\". According to the WFAA-TV in Dallas/Fort Worth, the album has a traditional bluegrass core, with a worldly flavor. Bruce Elder of The Sydney Morning Herald called Viridian a \\"tour de force\\". In the wake of Viridian, The Greencards have been internationally referred to as one of the most popular Americana musical acts in the United States. Bruce Elder went on to say that the band may, after Viridian, be the best country music performers to ever come out of Australia. In 2007, they were nominated for Best Country Album at the 21st Australian Recording Industry Association awards, ultimately losing to Keith Urban. In December 2007, it was announced that their song \\"Mucky the Duck\\" from Viridian was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance at the 50th Grammy Awards, but it ultimately lost to Brad Paisley's \\"Throttleneck\\". Written by Warner, \\"Mucky the Duck\\" was inspired by one of the band's favorite Houston musical venues, The Mucky Duck. Eamon McLoughlin is a regular blogger for Country Music Television. After the Grammy Awards, he wrote about the band's experience at the event, noting that despite not winning, the bar had been raised for their next album. The Greencards announced on their website in August 2008 that they had returned to the studio to record their fourth album with producer Jay Joyce. In September 2008, again via their website, they announced that they signed with Sugar Hill Records for their fourth album, to be released in spring 2009. === Fascination (from 2009) === On April 21, 2009, The Greencards released their fourth studio album, Fascination. Warner describes the album as \\"their most focused\\" work. On their previous albums, the three band members had individually put forward ideas for the music, until enough cohered into the finished work. For Fascination, he says they put aside their individual pride to create a stronger work. The years of touring experience The Greencards have accumulated since their earliest work has helped them, as well. Referring to when they formed the band, he said, \\"We just played in Austin. We just wrote probably anything, which was the only stuff we knew, which was more of a traditional thing. But since then, we've had five or six years of touring, all of the experiences, all of the people you meet. We've been so fortunate to play at all of these festivals which have a really eclectic form of music styles.\\" According to Young, the music on Fascination was a progression for the band, and a challenge for them. Comparing their prior work to the new album, she said, \\"They're probably a bit more bluegrass- influenced than this one here. While we still have the bluegrass and roots music influences, we really wanted to push ourselves harder on this one, something a bit more challenging to play live.\\" She described their music through their fourth album as having evolved, explaining that it began as traditional roots and bluegrass, but after six years is \\"our own little sound\\". The track \\"The Crystal Merchant\\" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance. In 2009, The Greencards continued to tour, performing again at MerleFest, the Strawberry Park Bluegrass Festival in Preston, Connecticut, Bluegrass in the Park in Henderson, Kentucky, and were on the bill for Lollapalooza. === Buy A Brick campaign === On November 8, 2010, The Greencards announced that they would self-finance the production on their next album, set for May 2011, rather than taking an advance from a record company. The Buy A Brick campaign is selling a package of an advance copy of the final CD, a digital image of the album artwork, video updates of the recording of the album and the subscriber's name (up to twenty characters) on the album artwork. Subscriptions are either $100 or $200 US with the more expensive package getting the album one week earlier and the subscriber's name on the front of the CD package. == Musical style and influences == The Greencards in concert in 2007 Considered by critics to be part of the progressive bluegrass (\\"newgrass\\") musical school, The Greencards draw from a wide variety of musical influences, ranging from Bob Dylan and the Beatles to the Celtic tone of Irish traditional music, gypsy themes, and Latin sounds. Despite the wide array of influences that shape their music, The Greencards have always maintained a distinctively Americana sound. While the various sounds that influence their work are always detectable, none ever dominate the band's music. Jim Abbott of the Tribune News Service described The Greencards as polished, \\"earthy, charming roots music with a sophisticated sheen\\", but noted that some bluegrass purists may miss the vocal idiosyncrasies that can be found on other acts such as the Del McCoury Band. Their appeal has been attributed to both their \\"instrumental dexterity\\" as well as the manner in which they both revere and flaunt bluegrass conventions. The progressive nature of The Greencards' bluegrass sound has been compared to Nickel Creek and Alison Krauss & Union Station. The Greencards' work on Movin' On had a looser, jam-based feeling to it, which they later firmed into a more polished sound after relocating to Nashville from Austin for Weather and Water. John T. Davis in No Depression Magazine stated The Greencards' best work on Weather and Water contained a \\"stillness\\", which he felt contrasted with the speed and \\"frantic\\" pace of some of the songs on Movin' On. While other critics had mentioned The Greencards in the context of jam bands, Davis went on to say that he felt the band was not one, and that they favored a leaner and \\"clean\\" sound driven more by Celtic roots. During their 2005 tour with Dylan and Nelson, Buzz McClain of The Washington Post believed that The Greencards play traditional American music better than some Americans do, because of their deep respect for bluegrass and the Americana sound. According to David McPherson in Bluegrass Unlimited magazine, the band's three-part harmonies evoke the soul sounds of gospel music. Kym Warner has said that Robert Earl Keen, Kelly Willis, and Patty Griffin were key influences musically in The Greencards's sound during their time in Austin, with the previously unreleased Griffin song \\"What You Are\\" being covered on their album Weather and Water. The recordings on Viridian, in particular the songs \\"River of Sand\\", \\"Waiting on the Night\\" and \\"When I Was in Love With You\\", were said to evoke the sounds of progressive folk rock that emerged in the 1960s. In Nashville Scene, Edd Hurt noted the eclectic tone of the band's overall body of recordings, and believed that their albums belonged to the tradition of singer-songwriter musicians. Their musical appeal to fans has been attributed to both their \\"instrumental dexterity\\" as well as the manner in which they both revere and flaunt bluegrass conventions. Naila Francis described The Greencards's sound as having a mellow tone, with \\"tender ballards and yarns\\" in their songs, but punctuated by bursts of energetic musical restlessness. Country Music Television in particular noted their melancholy but melodic sound. The Greencards have described their sound as \\"high energy acoustic music\\". == Discography == {class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:08em;\\" Title ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\" Formats ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:04em;\\" Details ! colspan=\\"1\\" Peak chart positions - style=\\"font-size:smaller;\\" ! width=\\"60\\" US Bluegrass - ! scope=\\"row\\" Movin' On  Long Play, Tape, Compact Disc, Digital Download, Cassette Single, 7\\" Single, 12\\" Single and CD Single.  * Release date: 2003 * Label: Dualtone Records  10 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Weather and Water  Long Play, Tape, Compact Disc, Digital Download, Cassette Single, 7\\" Single, 12\\" Single and CD Single.  * Release date: June 28, 2005 * Label: Dualtone Records  3 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Viridian  Long Play, Tape, Compact Disc, Digital Download, Cassette Single, 7\\" Single, 12\\" Single and CD Single.  * Release date: March 6, 2007 * Label: Dualtone Records  1 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Fascination  Long Play, Tape, Compact Disc, Digital Download, Cassette Single, 7\\" Single, 12\\" Single and CD Single.  * Release date: April 21, 2009 * Label: Sugar Hill Records  — - ! scope=\\"row\\" The Brick Album  Long Play, Tape, Compact Disc, Digital Download, Cassette Single, 7\\" Single, 12\\" Single and CD Single.  * Release date: June 21, 2011 * Label: Darling Street Records  8 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Sweetheart of the Sun  Long Play, Tape, Compact Disc, Digital Download, Cassette Single, 7\\" Single, 12\\" Single and CD Single.  * Release date: August 20, 2013 * Label: Darling Street Records  — -  colspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"font-size:8pt\\" \\"—\\" denotes releases that did not chart - } == See also == * Australian country music * Foggy Mountain Boys * Rank Strangers * Traditional bluegrass == References rnal links == * * * Category:American bluegrass music groups Category:Australian bluegrass music groups Category:American country music groups Category:Musical groups from Austin, Texas Category:Musical groups established in 2003 Category:2003 establishments in Texas Category:Australian expatriates in the United States ","title":"The Greencards"},{"id":"6237755","text":"Vicente Podico Lim (February 24, 1888 – December 31, 1944) was a Filipino brigadier general and World War II hero. Lim was the first Filipino graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point (Class of 1914). Prior to the establishment of the Philippine Army, he served as an officer in the Philippine Scouts (a now-defunct component of the US Army). During the Battle of Bataan, Lim was the Commanding General of the 41st Infantry Division, Philippine Army (USAFFE). After the fall of the Philippines he contributed to the Filipino resistance movement until his capture and subsequent execution. Lim was one of the seven Charter Members of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines. He is memorialized in the Philippines' 1,000-Peso banknote together with two other Filipino heroes who fought and died against the Japanese during the Second World War. ==Early life and education== Vicente Lim was born on February 24, 1888 in the town of Calamba, Laguna, and was the third of Jose Ayala Lim-Yaoco and Antonia Podico's four children. His father was a full- blooded Chinese migrant who braided his hair in a queue. His mother, Antonia Podico, was a Chinese mestiza. Jose Lim died when Vicente was just nine years old, leaving Vicente's mother to raise him and his three siblings from the earnings of a small business. Vicente and the other Lim children, Joaquin, Olympia and Basilisa, like many offspring of Filipino-Chinese marriages, grew up identifying themselves with the Filipino rather than the Chinese community. Among the friends of Jose Lim and Antonia Podico was the family of José Rizal, who was later recognized as the Philippines' national hero.Lim, V. (1980). To Inspire and to Lead : The Letters of Gen. Vicente Lim, 1938-1942. (A. Lim, Ed.) Manila. The Lim Family, like the Rizal Family, leased land owned by the Dominican Order: rice lands in the Calamba barrios of Lecheria and Real and sugar land in Barrio Barandal. In 1891, recurring disputes between the Spanish administrators of the Dominican estate and the tenants over rental rates and conditions came to a head and resulted in the eviction of many tenants from their lands. Among the victims were the Lim and Rizal families.Lim, V. (1980). To Inspire and to Lead : The Letters of Gen. Vicente Lim, 1938-1942. (A. Lim, Ed.) Manila. Vicente completed grade school in Tanauan, Batangas. ===Philippine-American War=== It was during the Philippine–American War where the fourteen-year-old Vicente's sense of nationalism and patriotism first came to the fore. It is said that he formed a group of children his age to act as couriers for the guerrilla movement of General Miguel Malvar's forces operating in the Calamba area.Lim, V. (1980). To Inspire and to Lead : The Letters of Gen. Vicente Lim, 1938-1942. (A. Lim, Ed.) Manila. ===Philippine Normal School=== In the period following the Philippine-American War, Vicente continued his studies at Liceo de Manila, and completed the teacher training program at the Philippine Normal School.(n.d.). The Filipino Philippine Scout Officers of the US Army. He went on to become a teacher in a public school in Santa Cruz, Manila for a year. He decided to pursue further studies and returned to Philippine Normal. Vicente was an outstanding student, getting top marks in mathematics, as well as in other subjects. He was as good an athlete as he was a student. Impressed by his athletic skills and intelligence, a supervisory teacher encouraged Vicente to take the entrance examinations for the United States Military Academy at West Point. While Vicente only placed second in these exams issued by the Philippine Bureau of Civil Service, his 99% score in Mathematics won him the coveted scholarship. In 1910, Vicente became the first Filipino to enter West Point.Lim, V. (1980). To Inspire and to Lead : The Letters of Gen. Vicente Lim, 1938-1942. (A. Lim, Ed.) Manila. ==Education at the United States Military Academy at West Point (1910–1914)\\"A birth date more amenable to Academy regulations\\"=== Vicente Lim's admission to West Point was not without any hitches. Army records reflect his birth date as April 5, 1888. By the time Lim reported to the United States Military Academy on March 1, 1910, he had already passed his 22nd birthday, which made him technically ineligible to enter the Academy. While Lim took the West Point qualifying examinations in 1908, which would have made him eligible to report to the Academy in March 1909, it is likely that the process of shipping required documents back and forth across the Pacific simply took too long. It thus became necessary to \\"indulge in the time-honored practice of adopting a birth date more amenable to Academy regulations.\\"(n.d.). The Filipino Philippine Scout Officers of the US Army. ===\\"Cannibal\\" Lim=== While Lim was the first Filipino to report to West Point, he was not the first foreign cadet to attend the Academy. At that time however, foreign cadets were still an uncommon sight. When Lim arrived in the United States, he could hardly speak English.Lim, R. (2010). Pushing the Envelope: A Biography of Capt. Roberto H. Lim: Composed of Collected Letters, Emails, and Photos. (A. Lim, Ed.) Manila: Mapua House Publications. His skin was darker than that of his American classmates, who were largely ignorant about the Philippines and thought that the Philippine Islands were inhabited by savages. These factors (and perhaps the racial prejudices that were still prevalent during that period), earned Vicente the nickname \\"Cannibal\\".United States Military Academy. (1914). The Howitzer. ===Cadet life=== For the first Filipino cadets who entered West Point, there was little incentive to excel academically. Filipino products of the Academy were restricted to entering service with the Philippine Scouts (then exclusively organized as an infantry unit) after graduation, whereas the regular privilege for top-ranking graduates was a choice of career path (engineers, coast artillery, cavalry and infantry, in the order of usual preference).(n.d.). The Filipino Philippine Scout Officers of the US Army. Nonetheless, Lim was eager to prove that he was just as competent as any of his classmates. \\"Cannibal\\" Lim strove to overcome his deficiencies (linguistic, or otherwise) -- and did so. He soon earned the respect of his classmates as he survived his military engineering subjects, and he excelled in chemistry and mathematics. Vicente was also popular as he helped the class \\"goats\\" in their Spanish lessons, since Spanish was his second language. He also excelled in fencing and earned a spot on the Academy's Broadsword Squad. For his skills on the firing range and proficiency in handling infantry weapons, he earned a badge as a Sharpshooter.United States Military Academy. (1914). The Howitzer. The rigorous training at West Point ingrained into Vicente's very being the Academy motto of \\"Duty, Honor and Country\\". This eventually became the dominating motivation in his life. ===Fighting racial prejudice=== Vicente Lim was known to his classmates as a person who was very proud of his country and his people. He refused to tolerate any form of derogatory remarks against him and against Filipinos. As a prelude to his struggle for equal treatment of Filipinos in the Army later on in his career, Lim often responded to racial provocations in a personal, or even physical way. These incidents often got him into trouble at the Academy. It was something that continued right up until the days leading up to Lim's graduation from West Point. Manuel L. Quezon, then the Philippines' Resident Commissioner to the United States (he would later on become the president of the Commonwealth of the Philippines), visited West Point to attend Lim's graduation ceremonies. Upon Quezon's arrival, he was met by the underclass Filipino cadets there, whom Quezon went on to ask where Lim was. One of the cadets said that Lim was \\"walking the area\\" (a traditional form of punishment at West Point) because, \\"a professor said a derogatory remark concerning Asians and Lim defended us.\\" To this, Quezon replied, \\"Lim is impetuous, but he certainly did the right thing.\\"Endy, C. E. (1981). USMA Foreign Cadet Program -- A Case Study. US Army War College. Carlisle: US Army. ===The first Filipino graduate of West Point=== After four years and having survived all the rigors of West Point, Vicente Lim graduated from the United States Military Academy on June 12, 1914 ranking 77th in a class of 107. Graduating was in itself an achievement, as the class of 1914 originally started out with 133 cadets. Lim was the only foreign cadet to graduate that year, in a class that originally included one cadet from Cuba and another from Ecuador.(n.d.). The Filipino Philippine Scout Officers of the US Army. ==Early military careerThe outbreak of World War I and Lim's initial assignments=== Upon graduation from the United States Military Academy, Vicente Lim was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Philippine Scouts. Prior to returning home to the Philippines, the young Lieutenant was sent to Europe to observe and study the set-up of the armies there. At the outbreak of the First World War, Lim was marooned in Berlin. To make his way back to the Philippines, Lim had to travel via the Trans-Siberian Railway, and had \\"quite an adventurous time making his way across Siberia.\\"Memorial Articles: Vicente Lim 1914. (1945, November 11). Retrieved September 25, 2013, from West Point Association of Graduates: http://apps.westpointaog.org/Memorials/Article/5282/ Lim eventually made it back to the Philippines, and was given his first assignment with a Scout garrison in Fort San Pedro, Iloilo in Western Visayas. Lim was later assigned to the island fortress of Corregidor. In 1916, Lim began teaching at the Academy for Officers of the Philippine Constabulary in Baguio City (the Academy was later renamed the Philippine Constabulary Academy, and eventually evolved into the present-day Philippine Military Academy). Lim taught courses in Military Art, Military Law and Topography and also handled Equitation and Athletics.Lim, V. (1980). To Inspire and to Lead : The Letters of Gen. Vicente Lim, 1938-1942. (A. Lim, Ed.) Manila. It was in Baguio that Vicente would meet and begin courting his future wife, Pilar Hidalgo, who was spending the summer at the Holy Family College. Pilar had gained distinction as one of the country's first female mathematicians and was the first female Cum Laude graduate of the University of the Philippines. (Pilar would also become known as a prominent civic leader, and one of the staunchest advocates of women's suffrage. Pilar later on became a co-founder of the Girl Scouts of the Philippines. She also became Centro Escolar University's third president after the death of Carmen de Luna and steered the university during the reconstruction and normalization of school operations after World War II.) Vicente and Pilar met each other for a second time in April 1917, and their courtship continued. On the 6th of the same month, the United States ended its neutrality and declared its entry into World War I. The Militia Act (enacted 17 March 1917) called for the formation of 3 brigades for the mobilization of a Filipino division to prepare for combat in Europe. Ultimately, certain political considerations, as well as other numerous delays would push the physical mobilization of these Filipino units to October 1918. The First World War ended a month later, without any of these troops being shipped out.Jose, R. T. (1992). The Philippine Army, 1935-1942. Manila: Ateneo de Manila University Press. However, the uncertainty brought about by the situation then, forced Lim to press for a quick engagement and an early wedding. A military wedding was held in Quiapo Church on August 12, 1917.Lim, V. (1980). To Inspire and to Lead : The Letters of Gen. Vicente Lim, 1938-1942. (A. Lim, Ed.) Manila. Soon after the wedding, Lim and his bride departed for Jolo and later on, Zamboanga, where Lim was assigned. ===First clash with General Douglas MacArthur and other controversies=== Just as he did during his days at West Point, Lim never hesitated to make his displeasure known towards unfair treatment and discrimination against Filipino officers on the basis of race. As early as 1914, Lim complained to Manuel L. Quezon about the \\"insults and petty harassment he had suffered because of his color\\". In 1922, as a Captain stationed with the 45th Infantry Regiment, Philippine Scouts at Fort McKinley (now Fort Bonifacio), Lim refused an order to transfer to Corregidor \\"when it became apparent that the reason for the order was to free living quarters at the Fort for incoming American officers.\\" The Commanding General of the Scout Brigade at McKinley, General Douglas MacArthur, relented, and allowed Lim to remain at his post.(n.d.). The Filipino Philippine Scout Officers of the US Army. It would not be the last time that Lim would clash with the army brass on similar issues. The task of ensuring that Filipino officers were accorded equal treatment in terms of compensation, benefits, promotion and respect in the American Army engaged Lim intellectually and emotionally. So passionate was Lim about this that there is a story of him punishing a lower-ranking American serviceman who refused to salute him. To get his point across, (then) Major Lim ordered the American to face a hat stand where his Major's cap was hung and to continuously salute the cap until ordered to stop. While Lim was mostly vocal on issues related to discrimination in the Army, he was equally vocal on the importance of maintaining a certain standard among its officer corps. He did not shy away from giving critiques of his fellow officers in the Philippine Scouts (Americans included) who were \\"unfit\\" to serve. In 1927, Lim wrote Major John Sullivan, assistant to General Frank McIntyre, the Bureau of Insular Affairs Chief: \\"I have many friends in the Scouts, but I can frankly state that as a whole they are the greatest handicap for the government ... The great majority of them are even disgusted with their own selves.\\"(n.d.). The Filipino Philippine Scout Officers of the US Army. Lim was a staunch believer that the strength of any military organization was a function of the quality of its corps of officers. It was a cause he would continue to champion later on in his career, during the formation of the fledgling Philippine Army. ===Further military education=== The passage of the National Defense Act of 1920 finally allowed Filipino officers to be assigned to various military schools in the United States for further military education. In 1926, Vicente Lim was assigned to the United States Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia. It was at Benning that Lim became classmates with Akira Nara, who would later on command the Japanese 65th Brigade, one of the Japanese Army's invading units during the Battle of Bataan (Lieutenant General Nara became notorious for having ordered the slaughter of over 350 men of the 91st Division, Philippine Army (USAFFE) ). Upon completion of his training at Benning, Lim was sent for further studies to the United States Army Command and General Staff College (USACGSC) at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. In 1928, Lim continued his extended stay in the United States, and he was subsequently assigned to the Army War College in Washington, D.C. As part of the coursework, then-Major Lim wrote a thesis in April 1929 entitled, \\"The Philippine Islands - A Military Asset\\". The paper was praised by the Commandant of the War College, Major General William D. Connor, as a \\"study of exceptional merit made at The Army War College\\". General Connor would go on to forward the document to the War Plans Division, War Department General Staff for reference, \\"being of interest to that Division\\". As it would turn out, the paper would accurately predict the conduct of the campaign Japan would eventually launch against Filipino and American forces in the Philippines in 1941–1942. These advanced courses enhanced Lim's knowledge of military science and further honed his keen military mind. At the outbreak of World War II, this same education and training would prove invaluable, as Lim was the only Filipino at that time to have attended the USACGSC and the Army War College.(n.d.). The Filipino Philippine Scout Officers of the US Army. This made him the only Filipino General technically qualified to command a division. ===Colegio de San Juan de Letran=== Lim returned to the Philippines in 1929 and was appointed the professor of military science and tactics (PMS&T;) at Colegio de San Juan de Letran and raised the standards of the training program there. ===Retirement from the US Army=== After more than 350 years of foreign rule and almost 40 years after the first declaration of Philippine independence at Kawit, Cavite, the Philippines took the penultimate step towards self-rule. On November 15, 1935, the Commonwealth of the Philippines was established. The first act of the Commonwealth Government, The National Defense Act or Commonwealth Act. No. 1 (enacted on December 21, 1935), laid out the country's National Defense Policy and established The Army of the Philippines, a force completely separate from that of the United States'. Lim's West Point education and his completion of command and general staff programs in the United States, made him a natural nominee to aid in the establishment of a national defense system for the Philippines. However, Lim was faced with a dilemma: either to stay on with the US Army as a Lieutenant Colonel and complete the required tenure for a full pension, or to join the fledgling Philippine Army, sacrifice his tenure and get less pay. Lim ultimately decided to do the latter; he retired from the United States Army June 30, 1936. He joined the Philippine Army and was immediately given the rank of Brigadier General.Memorial Articles: Vicente Lim 1914. (1945, November 11). Retrieved September 25, 2013, from West Point Association of Graduates: http://apps.westpointaog.org/Memorials/Article/5282/ *Article currently undergoing SIGNIFICANT editing beyond this point* ==Formation of the Philippine Army== *In progress* Lim was appointed chief of the War Plans Division of the Central General Staff of the Philippine Army. He was first assigned to the War Plans Division; quoting from his own letter, \\"Some of you who are on the inside of the War Department might have read my strategic reconnaissance of every corner of this country. I found that we have the manpower to defend our vital areas, and God has given us the advantage of our natural terrain features to effectively give a nice showing against any first class power. But because of our lack of finance we are struggling hard economically to solve this problem\\". In 1939 Lim became deputy chief of staff, Like he did on issues of discrimination against Filipino soldiers in the US Army, Vicente clashed with MacArthur and other top brass on the strategy being employed in building up the country's National defense. He believed that it was being built up too rapidly with no solid foundation to stand on. Most of the officers and recruits were half-baked and poorly trained. This was in addition to the fact that at the very core of the Army's organization, there was rampant corruption. As a more convenient and cheaper way to build up the Philippine Army, the National Defense Act of 1935 re-designated the Brigadier General Vicente Lim Philippine Constabulary (then the country's national police force) to become nucleus of the new Army. This, in Vicente's view, was a fundamental mistake. Vicente believed that the Army should be built from the ground up, so that it may develop its own unique traditions, ideology and esprit de corps. This was also to ensure that none of the 'rotten eggs' and flawed systems from the PC would be perpetuated in the new Army. On many occasions, Vicente threatened to resign from the Army, on account of his disgust with the institution, and the fact that he was \\"surrounded by crooks,\\" with \\"... no power nor influence to eliminate them\\". ==World War II and the Battle of BataanThe formation and mobilization of the 41st Infantry Division, Philippine Army=== Integration into the USAFFE *In progress* Up until December 1941, the United States had carefully maintained its neutrality, even as Japanese forces continued to wage war on the Chinese mainland and as Adolf Hitler's U-Boats menaced merchant shipping in the Atlantic Ocean. While America avoided being in a state of open conflict with any state, it did support the war efforts of the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China against the Axis Powers by sending weapons, supplies and materials under the Lend-Lease program. However, heightened tensions across the globe, deteriorating negotiations with Japan and the failure of all diplomatic efforts to halt Japanese aggression in the Far East, made it clear that it would only be a matter of time before the United States' involvement would entail more than just sending material aid to its allies. Japanese occupation of naval and air bases in Formosa and southern Indochina in July 1941, and the increasingly precarious situation and location of the Philippines (being in between Japan and the resource-rich Dutch East Indies), only added to the certainty that US interests in the Philippine Islands and the rest of the Pacific were directly under threat. As early as 1906, American pre-war military planning – the reality of having to fight a two-front war – \\"Europe First\\" strategy, wherein it was deemed that (the need to defeat Nazi Germany first, while fighting a holding action against Japan in the Pacific), there was increased optimism among American military leaders regarding the feasibility of defending the Philippines against a Japanese invasion.Costello, J. (1982). The Pacific War: 1941-1945. New York: HarperCollins. Materials were also sent to the Philippines in an effort to protect American interests in the Islands and in the Far East. 27 July 1941 - Creation of the USAFFE and integration of the Philippine Army into the USAFFE. Lim steps down as Deputy Chief of Staff to command the 41st Infantry Division 1 September 1941 - Mobilization of the Philippine Army In August 1941, as the threat of war loomed closer, President Manuel Quezon issued an order to place the Philippine Army and Philippine Constabulary under the command of the United States Armed Forces in the Far East (USAFFE). Even with the problems that plagued the Philippine Army, Vicente realized that the more imminent threat was the fact that there wasn't much time to mobilize a strong defense force for the country. Vicente knew that if the Japanese invaded, he could serve his country better by relinquishing his position as Deputy Chief of Staff (the second highest position in the Army) and assume a field command. He was eventually put in command of the 41st Infantry Division (PA). Recruits came from his home province of Laguna, as well as Rizal, Cavite, Quezon, and Marinduque. Almost all the men were awfully green and untested in combat. The main cantonment area of the 41st Division was set up along the Tagaytay ridge (today, the 41st Division, PA, USAFFE Shrine in Tagaytay marks the general location of the division's camp). Organization of the chain of command Consistent with his long-held belief that the strength of any military unit lies with the men that lead it, General Lim put a lot of thought into how the officers of the 41st Division were organized. He made it a point to get to know his men—their strengths, weaknesses, tendencies and personalities—and organized them, \\"according to the best principles of command\\"Lim, V. (1980). To Inspire and to Lead : The Letters of Gen. Vicente Lim, 1938-1942. (A. Lim, Ed.) Manila. and in a way he thought would work best in forging the 41st Division into an effective fighting unit. General Lim picked who he thought were the Army's best commanders. In cases where he felt that a commander was deficient in some of the requisite abilities or qualities, Lim assigned the best Executive Officers under them. For officers he knew to be effective in the field and were hard-working, but were somehow lacking in tact, he assigned subordinates whom he knew to be more effective communicators, to provide balance. General Lim also ensured that he picked the most competent Quartermasters for the Division, something that would prove invaluable during the battle that was forthcoming. ===The outbreak of war and the withdrawal to Bataan=== The little training (or in many cases, no training at all) that the men of the nascent Philippine Army received between September 1941 and December 1941, would turn out to be all they would take to battle against the menace that was to befall the Philippine Islands. As late as December 1, 1941, only about two-thirds of the 41st Division had been called into active service. Only a few days later, on December 7, 1941 (December 8, 1941 in Asian time zones), Japan launched an attack on Pearl Harbor. Within a matter of hours of each other, Japanese forces also commenced attacks on Guam, Wake Island, the British crown colony of Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaya, and the Philippines. Setting up defenses along the Batangas coastline General Douglas MacArthur's initial strategy for defending the Philippines was to stop the Japanese at the beaches at all costs (in contrast to the original War Plan Orange 3, which called for an immediate withdrawal to the Bataan Peninsula). He divided his command into the North Luzon Force, the South Luzon Force and the Visayan-Mindanao Force. Brigadier General Vicente Lim's 41st Infantry Division was one of two divisions (along with the 51st Infantry Division, Philippine Army) assigned to the much smaller South Luzon Force under Brigadier General George M. Parker Jr. The South Luzon Force was assigned to defend the beaches south and east of Manila. Its mission was to protect the airfields in its sector and prevent hostile landings.Morton, L. (n.d.). The Decision to Withdraw to Bataan. Retrieved November 7, 2013, from US Army Center of Military History: http://www.history.army.mil/books/70-7_06.htm The 41st Division's area of responsibility was the coastline of Nasugbu, Batangas. There, General Lim's division dug in. Well-designed and organized defenses were set up by the division. However, the men eventually had to abandon the sector, as all units were ultimately ordered to begin withdrawal to Bataan. At the very least, some of the nervous troops of the 41st were assured that their weapons worked, as turtles occasionally triggered improvised warning devices in the dark, causing troops along the line to fire at what they thought to be infiltrating Japanese.Atienza, R. (1985). A Time for War: 105 Days in Bataan. Manila: Eugenia S. vda. de Atienza The withdrawal to Bataan Despite the ten- hour window between the time news was received about the attack on Pearl Harbor and the first Japanese attacks on the Philippines, American and Filipino forces were still generally caught by surprise. Within hours, many airfields and naval stations were destroyed by Japanese air attacks. Many valuable American aircraft had been caught on the ground, and the bulk of those that survived the initial Japanese raids were sent south to Mindanao, en route to Australia. The US and Philippine Army units meant to contain hostile Japanese landings at the beaches were eventually overwhelmed by the initial Japanese onslaught. It soon became apparent that a withdrawal to Bataan (as called for in War Plan Orange 3) was the best remaining option for Filipino and American forces, and from there, deny the use of Manila Bay by the Japanese. On December 24, 1941, USAFFE headquarters notified all unit commanders that \\"WPO-3 is in effect\\". With this, the withdrawal to the Bataan Peninsula began. Like all other units, General Lim's 41st Division was given the order to move out of their positions along the Batangas coast and move out to Bataan that Christmas Eve. Almost all the USAFFE units which made a withdrawal from the beaches had to make a fighting retreat. General Lim's division however, in the course of its withdrawal from the Batangas coast to Bataan (through Manila), was fortunate not to have come in contact with any hostile forces. Thus, the Division entered Bataan intact. =Acquisition of supplies= With the hurried withdrawal of the USAFFE to Bataan, the defenders had to deal with the unfortunate reality that much of their vital supplies simply could not be brought into the peninsula in time. Thus, historical accounts that discuss the Battle of Bataan invariably touch on the meager rations that all the Filipino and American defenders relied on during the course of the gallant stand. Fortunately for the men of the 41st Division, their situation was slightly more favorable, at least during the initial phase of the battle. A paper written by Col. Juanito R. Rimando in 1978 described Brigadier General Vicente Lim as a commander who was \\"very particular about the Division's status on supplies and food\\". Ensuring that his men were well provided for started with choosing (in General Lim's own words) \\"the best Quartermaster\\" available. The Division Quartermaster chosen by General Lim before the war began was Juan O. Chioco, assisted by an equally able Executive Officer, Ernesto D. Rufino. Taking a cue from their Commanding General, both Chioco and Rufino secured supplies on their own initiative, even if it meant not being totally dependent on the Division's \\"normal sources of supply\\". On December 28, 1941, there were rumors that the USAFFE had opened its depot at Angeles, Pampanga and Army units were free to get all the supplies that they needed and could carry. Promptly, Chioco ordered Rufino to take 22 trucks to gather much-needed supplies. Rufino returned with the trucks the next day, hauling large quantities of food, clothing, supplies and other equipment. The supplies were stored at the Balanga Sugar Central. A few days after, an American inspector from higher headquarters arrived at the 41st Division's quartermaster headquarters and was surprised with the large quantity of supplies the Division had. Apparently appalled by what he discovered, the inspector \\"accused Captain Chioco of hoarding while other units lacked these. He threatened to file court-martial charges against Chioco\\". The American officer took the matter to General Lim. The officer expected General Lim to side with him, but instead the General \\"bawled him out like hell and said ... that he's got no business interfering with the affairs of the Division, much more so on ... the way the supplies under question were procured.\\" Rimando writes, \\"The American inspector left a more subdued individual\\".Rimando, J. (1978). Brigadier General Vicente Lim and the 41st Division (Unpublished MA Thesis). University of the Philippines, Manila. The relatively better supply situation of the 41st Division is corroborated in memoirs written by other 41st Division veterans such as Captain Jose M. Zuño. On December 29, 1941, Zuño wrote, \\"BGen Vicente Lim, 41st Div Commanding Gen distributed bacon and Lucky Strikes cigarettes as Christmas presents, to the officers and men of the division.\\"Zuño, J. (1941, December 29). Personal diary. There can be little doubt that all these played an essential role in making the 41st Infantry Division one of the most effective fighting units during the Battle of Bataan. ===The defense at Abucay=== *In progress* \\"Lim is the hero of Bataan\\", states the Philippine Army Bulletin of April 1947, \\"General Lim's 41st Division made possible the Battle of Abucay, which I believe is the most decisive battle of Bataan. , . At Abucay the Japs for the first time met real opposition. . . Contact at Abucay was about 8 January 1942. The Japs, employing massed artillery followed closely by aggressive infantry action hit the 41st Division. For the next 18 days the Japs tried to break the 41st Division line and failed. Abucay was abandoned on 25 January when Jap breakthroughs in Moron and Natib made Abucay untenable. . . After Abucay the Japs started to withdraw from Bataan, and resumed their attack in April, thus allowing MacArthur forty precious days for the preparation of Australia as an operational base. If any one factor can be said to have contributed mostly to make Bataan possible, that can be Abucay. And If any one unit can be said to have made Abucay possible that is General Lim's 41st Division. *In progress* Absolute knowledge that they were to hold at all cost gave those members of the Regiment, who were fighting for their homeland, an additional incentive. The Filipino soldier did not have to be motivated to fight.

Fort Benning: US Army. *In progress* Abucay, not yielding an inch of ground, saving Bataan from early defeat It was in Bataan that the Japanese met the stiffest resistance from the armed forces during the campaign. For over 3 months, the 41st Division fought gallantly under grueling hostile fire, determined not to give up any ground. It was assigned to defend the biggest portion of the main battle position, yet it repelled the heavy armored and infantry attacks of the Japanese. The previously untested troops of the 41st repeatedly denied any ground to the superior enemy forces and inflicted heavy casualties on every Japanese offensive. Because of the repeated beatings they received from the 41st, the Japanese actually began avoiding the sector that the 41st defended. For this, General Lim, and the rest of the men of the 41st Infantry Division earned respect and commendation from their co-defenders. In a letter sent to General Lim during the siege, Carlos P. Romulo wrote: \\"Everyone here is praising your courage and your ability. You are THE one Filipino General who has caught the imagination of everyone. The General (MacArthur), speaks highly of you all the time ... The General has spoken to the President (Quezon) about your courage and he has praised you time and again. The President once told me: \\"I have always said that fellow Lim is the only General we have in our army with cojones, and he is showing it now.\\" Romulo later on wrote, \\"General Lim is the embodiment of the Philippine Army in Bataan: ragged, starved, sick unto death, beaten back hour after hour --- but invincible!\\" ===The Orion-Bagac Line=== Having been forced out of their positions along the Mauban-Abucay line, the Filipino and American defenders of Bataan made a hasty withdrawal to its second (and last) defense line on Bataan, the Orion-Bagac line. Compared to the Mauban-Abucay position, the Orion-Bagac line was a shorter, continuous line that spanned the middle of the Bataan Peninsula. Here, General's Lim's 41st Division was assigned to defend the center of the line, in front of Mt. Samat extending to the Pantingan River to the west. The Battle for Trail 2 By 26 January 1942, all USAFFE units had made good their withdrawal to the Orion-Bagac line. The Japanese forces on the other hand, were eager to force a quick conclusion to the battle and pressed on with little respite. Unfortunately for the USAFFE troops, there was still much confusion as to the final disposition of some units along the front. During the withdrawal from the Mauban-Abucay line, a number of changes were made by the USAFFE Command to initial plans and assignments, and this information did not get to some individual unit commanders in time. As a result, there were many critical gaps along the line that were left undefended. One such gap was the position astride Trail 2 and near the barrio of Capot (since renamed to Barangay General Vicente Lim), an important north–south trail that offered the Japanese the easiest route of advance (with the exception of Bataan's East Road) south to Limay, one of the objectives of the Japanese attack. General Clifford Bluemel, the sector commander for the area around Trail 2 and one of those who was not properly informed of the shifts of units along the front line discovered the gap not too long before the Japanese put their next attack in motion. To remedy the dangerous situation, a mix of various units, led by the 41st Infantry Regiment (already recipients of a Presidential Unit Citation for its actions in Abucay) of General Lim's 41st Division were sent to plug the gaps. By the night of 27 January, the 41st Infantry, after a 24-hour march to the sector, joined units from the 31st and 51st Divisions just in time to aid against the Japanese attack on the area which was already underway. By the 29th, more Japanese troops made their way across the Pilar River, and towards a bamboo thicket just 75 yards in front of the USAFFE's main line of resistance. The resulting battle was a brisk and bloody one fought at close quarters. General Lim's men, as they did along the Abucay Line, held firm against every Japanese onslaught. Company K of the 41st Infantry met the enemy at bayonet point. The next morning, more than a hundred dead Japanese were found within 150 yards of the main line of resistance. Some of the bodies, were found only a few yards away from the Filipinos' foxholes who suffered only light casualties. The Japanese effort to penetrate the USAFFE line had failed. Despite their heavy losses, the Japanese resumed their attacks on the night of 31 January. While their attack was preceded by aerial and artillery bombardments, the Japanese were again frustrated when effective machine gun fire halted their planned infantry advance. On 2 February, the 31st Engineer Battalion, Philippine Army was sent to decisively clear the bamboo thicket of the remaining Japanese troops. Shortly after their attack had begun, the Engineers met stiff resistance and their attack stalled. Once again, the men of the 41st were called on, and sent to aid in the attack. The advance of the Filipinos then continued, and by dusk, they had finally reached the thicket. The next morning, they resumed their attack only to find that they had cleared the area of all remaining Japanese, effectively ending the threat to Trail 2.Morton, L. (1953). The Fall of the Philippines. Washington D.C.: United States Army Center of Military History. The fight for Trail 2 remains one of the finest moments in Philippine Army history. Lull in the fighting and the proposal to counterattack By February 1942, the Japanese had already overshot their original estimate of being able to secure the Philippines within 50 days. The commander of Japanese forces, General Homma, ordered the suspension of offensive operations, in order to regroup and reorganize. As a result, there was a lull in the fighting on Bataan until the middle part of March 1942. General Vicente Lim understood that unless a Japanese soldier was either dead or totally disabled, he was not going to stop attacking.Flores, M. T. (1949). An Analytical Study of the Defense of Bataan. Command and General Staff College. Fort Leavenworth: US Army. Thus, during the lull, he made a proposal to the high command for a counterattack by USAFFE forces towards San Fernando, Pampanga. General Lim hoped that a counterattack north, would not only regain ground and their previous defensive positions, but would also give the USAFFE a chance to acquire much needed food stocks. He also believed it would provide a much-needed morale boost to the Filipino and American troops. Unfortunately, no counterattack materialized. It will never be known how much success such a counterattack would have actually yielded (and how much it would have really changed the long term course of events), but the admissions of Japanese Generals Homma and Takaji Wachi after the war suggest that there was indeed a great chance of success. So \\"demoralized and badly mangled\\" were the invading Japanese, that of its 16th Division and 65th Brigade, only two battalions could be classified 'effective' at the timeUnson, B. (1956, April 11). Hero of Bataan. Kislap (Graphic) Magazine, pp. 16-17. \\"To inspire and to lead\\" The effectiveness of the 41st Division as a fighting unit was as much due to the capability of its leadership, as it was about the bravery and tenacity of its fighting men. Brigadier General Vicente Lim's competence and his ability to get the most out of his men, contributed to making the 41st Division one of the most decorated units in the Battle of Bataan. An excerpt from the memorial article written by his classmates at West Point, best describes the way General Lim led men in battle: \\"General Lim knew his military science. General Lim had an uncanny faculty of predicting events. General Lim was an excellent judge of men. Although he had gained the reputation in peace time of being rough and outspoken, in war he was father to his men. He was accessible, and gave his counsel when this was sought. He made his subordinates fight by making them feel that upon their personal efforts depended the outcome of the battle.\\"Memorial Articles: Vicente Lim 1914. (1945, November 11). Retrieved September 25, 2013, from West Point Association of Graduates: http://apps.westpointaog.org/Memorials/Article/5282/ An article written by Life Magazine reporter Melville Jacoby on March 16, 1942 in turn, offers a testimony to how General Lim's soldiers responded to his leadership: \\"One Filipino general is a West Pointer – the first from the Philippines to graduate – swarthy, barking General Vicente Lim, whose soldiers say if they don't jump at his command he'll kick them in the tail. Lim was most pleased the other day when he needed 50 volunteers from his men for a patrol mission and 200 stepped forward.\\"Jacoby, M. (1942, March 16). MacArthur's Men. Life Magazine, pp. 14-23. While much praise was showered on General Vicente Lim for his leadership and the performance of his Division, it was his earnest desire to make sure credit was given where it was due. In his last known letter from Bataan, General Lim wrote to his wife: \\"With all this talk I sincerely give the credit to my officers and enlisted men. They are the ones who did it all. Mine is only to inspire and to lead them. When history is written I will give them all the credit. Their satisfaction is mine to share.\\" ===The fall of Bataan=== After almost four months of fighting the Japanese, the elements, hunger and disease, and with their fates already sealed by the decision made by Allied leaders to defeat Hitler's Germany first, the beleaguered defenders of Bataan were simply in no condition and position to effectively resist the enemy's final push to defeat them. The final Japanese offensive for Bataan began on Good Friday, April 3, 1942. The main attack was directed at the center of the main line of resistance, the sector covered by General Lim's 41st Division. The attack was preceded by an intense and sustained aerial and artillery bombardment. The intensity of the bombardment and the use of incendiaries effectively depleted the Division's ability to hold the line. By April 7, 1942, General Lim had assessed that the fight was over. One of Lim's last official acts was to issue a commendation to his division, \\"Your courageous and tenacious defense of your line for the last five days against tremendous odds and continuous bombing and shelling by the enemy merits my highest praise and commendation. I am proud to lead such a group of men.\\"Memorial Articles: Vicente Lim 1914. (1945, November 11). Retrieved September 25, 2013, from West Point Association of Graduates: http://apps.westpointaog.org/Memorials/Article/5282/ On April 9, 1942, all Filipino and American forces on Bataan were ordered to surrender. Bataan had fallen. ===The Bataan Death March and incarceration at Camp O'Donnell=== After the surrender of Bataan, the Japanese Command anticipated that they would take around 25,000 prisoners of war (POWs), only to find that they did not have the logistics to transport the more than 65,000 Filipinos and 12,000 Americans who surrendered. The Japanese had also assumed that the surrendering soldiers would have their own rations, not realizing that the defenders that had given them such stiff resistance for more than three months, had just been surviving on half rations or less. The results were no less than disastrous. Filipino and American prisoners, who were already exhausted, sick and starving, were forced to go on a 65-mile (105 km) forced march from Mariveles, Bataan to San Fernando, Pampanga. Thousands died along the way. But starvation and exhaustion were not the only killers in this \\"march of death\\". Prisoners were subjected to untold brutalities by their Japanese captors, who had all been trained in the Samurai's medieval warrior code -- Bushido—and were taught that being taken prisoner was far worse than death. All prisoners, therefore, were looked upon as subhuman and unworthy of respect.Costello, J. (1982). The Pacific War: 1941-1945. New York: HarperCollins. Stragglers were beaten, shot or bayoneted. Those who attempted to escape or stop to get water met the same fate. Many that were too sick to continue on the march were buried alive. Even the courageous Filipino civilians that were caught offering food or drink to the passing columns, were beaten or killed as well. Those that survived the march to San Fernando were then herded like cattle and jammed into boxcars, where thousands more died of suffocation because they had all been packed in too tight. Many accounts describe how the dead were kept standing because there simply wasn't any room for them to fall. The trains then took the POWs to Capas, Tarlac, from where they had to march the last 8 miles to Camp O'Donnell. This whole tragedy would later become known as the infamous \\"Bataan Death March\\". Some estimates state that as many as 20,000 men died during the march. General Lim was among those who survived. Unbeknownst to the survivors of the 9-day Death March, their suffering was far from over. A former Philippine Army camp, Camp O'Donnell was a facility designed to accommodate only 10,000 men. Cramming five times that number into the camp resulted in the deaths of thousands more. Poor sanitation, the lack of medical facilities, the shortage of food and water, and the continued brutality of the Japanese guards all contributed to the death toll. ===Underground resistance and guerrilla operations=== As if the ordeal of the Bataan Death March and the horrific conditions at Camp O'Donnell were not enough, many surviving American POWs were sent off on \\"hell ships\\" to do forced hard labor in Japan, Manchuria, Korea and Taiwan, among others, until the end of the war. Those that were too weak, were incarcerated in various POW camps across the Philippines. Filipino POWs that survived O'Donnell were more fortunate, as they were eventually paroled and released by the Japanese. All were made to sign waivers that they would not join any resistance movements. Nonetheless, many did continue to fight the Japanese and joined the underground and various guerrilla organizations. Upon his release, General Lim went to live in Manila with his brother-in-law's family, the Clemente Hidalgos. By this time, the Japanese had installed a puppet government headed by President José P. Laurel. Lim was sent feelers to head the puppet Philippine Constabulary. Absolutely determined not to have anything to do with the Japanese-controlled government, he had himself confined at the Institute of Cancer building of the Philippine General Hospital. With the cooperation of his doctors, Lim was pronounced \\"sick\\", giving him a ready excuse to turn down the appointments offered to him. He supposedly told an enraged Filipino ranking official that he preferred death at the hands of the Japanese, rather than an assassin's bullet. Lim used his time at the PGH to get back to health. Friends sent him food and other forms of help, and thus was comparatively well provided for. Lim sustained himself at the hospital by using proceeds from the sale of shares he owned in the Mangco Dry Dock. He continued to fight the Japanese using these same funds, personally financing various guerrilla activities in the provinces. Directing all of these operations from the PGH, Lim had his operatives give regular weekly reports about Japanese troop movements, disposition, and military installations.Montemayor, M. (1945, March 11). Personal letter to Pilar Hidalgo-Lim. Manila. Such information, like those provided by many other brave Filipino guerrillas, greatly contributed to the success of American and Filipino military operations to liberate the Philippines in the latter part of 1944 to 1945. General Lim's involvement in the underground and guerrilla operations inevitably made him a target of the Japanese Military Police. ==Capture and death== In June 1944, General Lim was ordered to make his way to Australia to join General MacArthur in planning the re-capture of the Philippines. He also received information that he could be picked up by Kempeitai at any time. The decision was made to try to escape from the Philippines. While on route to Negros Island to meet a submarine that was to take him to Australia, the batel General Lim was riding with his companions, was flagged down off the coast of Batangas. The Japanese searched the hold and arrested Lim and his companions when two guns were found in the batel's hold. They were made prisoners and first taken to Calapan, Mindoro for initial investigations before being sent back to Manila. Lim and his companions were imprisoned in Fort Santiago for the duration of the investigation and interrogation. There, Lim was reportedly tortured. The filthy conditions in which prisoners were kept, caused General Lim to contract a skin disease. Despite this, stories from fellow prisoners tell of how General Lim kept the spirits of the other prisoners up, and encouraged them to not lose hope. Eventually, the results of the investigation at Fort Santiago laid a death sentence on Lim. He was transferred to the Kempeitai headquarters at the Far Eastern University and subsequently to the old Bilibid Prison. Nothing was heard of him after his transfer to Bilibid. Records pronounced General Lim \\"missing\\" in 1944. It was a full 50 years later, in 1994, that the Lim family was able to make contact with Richard Sakakida, who had actually witnessed General Lim's death. Sakakida, a Nisei, was a United States Army intelligence agent stationed in the Philippines at the outbreak of World War II. He told the family that General Lim, together with some 50 or so guerrillas, were taken to the Chinese Cemetery where a long trench had been dug. They were all made to kneel and subsequently beheaded. Their bodies were then thrown into the trench and covered. General Lim's body was never found. ==Honors, tributes, memorials and legacyLegacy=== Brigadier General Vicente Lim's distinguished service in the military spanned a period of almost 35 years and 2 World Wars. He was a pioneer throughout his career, being the first Filipino to graduate from West Point (and from various general staff schools), a charter member of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines, and a key figure in the formation of a young nation's armed forces. He continued to \\"inspire and to lead\\" throughout the gallant stand at Bataan, and the guerrilla resistance. Today, he is remembered as the consummate professional soldier, who never compromised his principles, and stayed true to \\"Duty, Honor and Country\\" to the very end. ===Medals for gallantry and outstanding military service=== For all his years of serving with distinction in the military and for \\"exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services and achievements\\" Lim was posthumously awarded the Legion of Merit by the United States Army. Lim was also posthumously awarded the Purple Heart by the United States (awarded for \\"being wounded or killed in any action against an enemy of the United States or as a result of an act of any such enemy or opposing armed forces\\"). In recognition of General Lim's bravery and gallantry during the Battle of Bataan, the Philippine government awarded him the Distinguished Conduct Star and the Distinguished Service Star, the Philippines' second, and third highest military awards. He was also given a posthumous honorary rank of Lieutenant General. ===Monuments and memorials=== In recognition of his services to the Filipino people, General Lim likeness appears on the Philippine 1,000 Peso banknote together with José Abad Santos and Josefa Llanes Escoda. Lim also appears on postage stamps (₱3.20 value) which were first issued on August 22, 1982. In September 1951, the former Camp Paciano Rizal in Calamba, Laguna was renamed Camp General Vicente P. Lim in honor of the revered commanding general of the 41st Infantry Division. The location of the Camp was the site where the 41st Field Artillery Regiment of the 41st Division was mobilized prior to the outbreak of World War II in the Philippines. The Camp once served as the site of the Philippine National Police Academy and the headquarters of the PNP's INP Training Command. Today, Camp Vicente Lim serves as the Headquarters of Police Regional Office 4 (PRO 4), whose area of responsibility covers the ten provinces of Region IV: Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, Quezon, Oriental and Occidental Mindoro, Romblon, Marinduque, and Palawan. Across the Cultural Center of the Philippines, on Roxas Boulevard is a statue of Brigadier General Vicente Lim, along with a marker with the inscription: \\"We are born to live a life which is valuable only if we live it unselfishly, not for our own gratification, nor for that of our family - but for our country. Men should not fear death, but dishonor and defeat. There is nothing more beautiful than to live and die for the defense of one's country against a common enemy. There is nothing meaner and more vile than to yield to that enemy without fighting to the last ditch.\\" - Vicente Lim, March 20, 1941. It is a quote from a speech the General gave to a group of UP ROTC graduates during their commencement exercises. A bust of Brigadier General Vicente Lim, is one of six busts featuring various Philippine national heroes in the town square of Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. The Headquarters building at the Philippine Military Academy is named Lim Hall in the General's honor. Various schools across the Philippines (such as the General Vicente Lim Elementary School in Tondo, Manila) are named after Lim. The former Barangay Kaput/Capot in Orion, Bataan is now named Barangay General Lim. Part of one of the more important battles during the Battle of Bataan, the Battle of Trail 2, took place here. Many streets across the Philippines are named after General Vicente Lim. ===Traditions and annual ceremonies in honor of General Vicente Lim=== February 24 (General Lim's birthday) Various ceremonies mark the birth anniversary of General Vicente Lim. Ceremonies are held in Camp General Vicente P. Lim (hosted by the PNP-PRO4), in front of General Lim's statue along Roxas Boulevard (hosted by the City of Manila), as well as the ancestral lot where General Lim was raised in Calamba (hosted and organized by the Masonic Lodge of Calamba - Dr. Jose P. Rizal Lodge No. 270). Rank insignia distribution - Philippine Military Academy A general is easily distinguished from officers of lower rank because of the stars attached to the general's helmet or shoulder boards. The rank insignia of a Lieutenant in the US Army on the other hand, is a bar. General Lim once told his wife Pilar, that receiving his lieutenant's bar upon graduating from West Point was more meaningful and memorable to him than it was receiving his first star as a general. This simple confession became the basis of a rich tradition that has lasted for more than 50 years. Upon leaving the institution, graduates of the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) are commissioned as Second Lieutenants or Ensigns in the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Their rank insignia is a triangle, a symbol associated with the Philippine Revolution against Spanish rule in the 1800s. Since 1957, it has been the tradition of the direct descendants of General Vicente Lim to distribute these first rank insignia to the graduating class of the Academy. The tradition was initiated by Vicente's wife, Pilar Hidalgo Lim, not only to honor the memory of her late husband, but also, to help impart upon the future leaders of the Armed Forces, the principles which defined his life. ==Other personal details== General Lim was described by his West Point classmates as \\"rough and cheerful\\" and \\"had a sense of humor\\". They also described him as someone who \\"had a kind heart under this rough exterior, and was very considerate of others in the smallest details. He fully absorbed the spirit of West Point, and was always proud that he was a graduate.\\" Furthermore, while Lim had a \\"reputation ... of being rough and outspoken\\", he \\"had human weakness\\". In Bataan, upon learning that his wife would be broadcasting a message on the radio, General Lim \\"ran to our radio tent and tears welled from his eyes as he heard his wife's voice and a message from his daughter.\\"Memorial Articles: Vicente Lim 1914.

His letters reveal that Lim played the stock market and entered into various oil and mining ventures to help augment his income. General Lim was known to be a Mason. His son, Vicente Lim Jr. (1923-2012),AOG obituary later graduated from West Point in June 1944 (around the time of his father's capture). ==Notable quotesAbout his fellow soldiers=== \\"With all this talk I sincerely give the credit to my officers and enlisted men. They are the ones who did it all. Mine is only to inspire and to lead them. When history is written I will give them all the credit. Their satisfaction is mine to share.\\" \\\\- Brigadier General Vicente Lim, in a letter to his wife from the front line in Bataan, February 20, 1942 ===On service and fighting for one's country=== \\"... to me, the satisfaction of the service, well done, is more than anything that any amount of money can give. This you might call is the satisfaction you get for your services towards your own people and country ... But most important of all is to leave a name that my posterity may be proud of.\\" \\\\- Brigadier General Vicente Lim, in a letter to one of his sons, 1938 \\"I am of the firm conviction that the success of national defense will not depend much on the armaments nor the training of our able-bodied men but will depend 90% on the will of the people to fight for the country.\\" \\\\- Brigadier General Vicente Lim, in a letter to his sons, 1940 \\"There are many forms of service that you can render to your country ... what I want to impress on you is that if death is necessary to accomplish your end in upholding your dignity and that of your country then death should be nothing.\\" \\\\- Brigadier General Vicente Lim, in a letter to his sons, 1941 \\"We are born to live a life which is valuable only if we live it unselfishly, not for our own gratification, nor for that of our family - but for our country.

I wish you will bear in mind that no matter how small a thing you want to do, plan it ahead of time, think it over and allot a certain time for you to prepare your plans, for a mediocre plan is better than a brilliant unprepared plan that is haphazardly carried out.\\" \\\\- Brigadier General Vicente Lim, in a letter to his sons, 1941 ===On patriotism, democracy and nation building=== \\"The principal defect of our national defense is not the training nor the lack of finances, but the great and dangerous defect of democracy which has been implanted into the minds of the Filipino people. We have a nationally wrong conception of democracy. Our democracy in the Philippines is unilateral. It is only for the benefit, for the freedom, for the rights, comfort and happiness of each individual member of the nation. That is the common belief, and I venture to say that 99.9% of our people believe in that kind of democracy. They do not know their obligations, their duties and the sacrifices that they should give to the state which is the relative counterpart of the amount of personal democracy he should indulge. The two should balance.\\" \\\\- Brigadier General Vicente Lim, in a letter to his sons, 1940 \\"If we desire the respect of other nations, we must show them that we are exerting all efforts to build a nation not only strong in arms but unconquerable in spirit. An indomitable will to fight & an unflinching resolution to defend at all costs \\"life, liberty & the pursuit of happiness\\" are the fundamental characteristics of any nation that deserves to survive\\" \\\\- Brigadier General Vicente Lim, in a commencement address to the ROTC graduates of the University of the Philippines, March 1941 \\"A civilian doing his work in the pursuit of national defense is just as much a soldier as a man in uniform, if not better; because patriotism is a moral quality which should be possessed by all.\\" \\\\- Brigadier General Vicente Lim, in a commencement address to the ROTC graduates of the University of the Philippines, March 1941 ===Others=== \\"You must, however, not lose your sense of humor, which is also a great item in your success. Sense of humor is the counterweight for your misfortunes which you will meet from time to time, from the smallest to the biggest ... If you take anything seriously without any sense of humor and you should happen to fail, it will be the beginning of your downfall.\\" \\\\- Brigadier General Vicente Lim, in a letter to his sons, 1939 \\"My greatest misgiving in this Army is the old system of the Filipino people. For an honest man it is rather the cause of my unhappiness. I am unhappy every time I see an officer or a reserve given more advantage over his brother officer because of his political or personal pull. That irritates me so much, I just cannot get over it.\\" \\\\- Brigadier General Vicente Lim, in a letter to his sons, 1940 ==In film== Vicente Lim is depicted in the 1955 John Ford movie, The Long Gray Line. In that scene, he is portrayed graduating with the United States Military Academy Class of 1915 (instead of 1914), \\"the class the stars fell on\\", perhaps in the context of listing the notable cadets of the period who went on to have outstanding military careers and were made famous by their meritorious service and wartime exploits. ==References *Extensive information and media on Vicente Lim is available on the Brigadier General Vicente Lim Facebook page Category:1888 births Category:1944 deaths Category:People from Calamba, Laguna Category:Filipino people of Chinese descent Category:United States Military Academy alumni Category:Foreign recipients of the Legion of Merit Category:Filipino generals Category:Filipino military personnel of World War II Category:People executed by Japanese occupation forces Category:Bataan Death March prisoners Category:Filipino prisoners of war Category:Scouting in the Philippines Category:Burials at the Manila Chinese Cemetery Category:Philippine Normal University alumni Category:Filipino schoolteachers Category:20th-century Filipino educators Category:Filipino military personnel killed in World War II ","title":"Vicente Lim"},{"id":"6237758","text":"Carl Williams (November 11, 1959 - April 7, 2013), nicknamed \\"The Truth\\", was an American boxer who competed as a professional from 1982 to 1997.

Last updated : April 12, 2006. == Professional career == Williams soon turned pro, signing a contract with Ron Katz of the Top Rank. After the initial successes he moved to a suburban motel in White Plains, New York, in order to concentrate on training, and stay away from big-city temptations. He was trained by Carmen Graziano.Carl ‘The Truth’ Williams was as skilled a heavyweight as any that ever stepped into the ring by Tim Smith, New York Daily News, April 12, 2013.Carl 'The Truth' Williams: Boxer who fought Mike Tyson and Larry Holmes by Steve Bunce, The Independent, 17 April 2013. Williams' first title shot was against Larry Holmes, a fight he lost in a controversial decision. His next fight was a victory against Jesse Ferguson. He then suffered a devastating knockout loss to Mike Weaver, which took him sixteen months to regain his shape and get back to the ring. Williams is perhaps best known for having fought and lost to Mike Tyson (whom he first faced in sparring sessions, August 1, 1983, six years before the title fight, while Tyson was a 17-years-old amateur and Williams was 23 years old with a professional record 11-0)Mike Tyson - Most Brutal Boxing Sparring Wars in a battle for the undisputed heavyweight championship. The first round knockout loss to Tyson in 1989 was a devastating defeat for Williams. Midway through the round, Tyson slipped a jab from Williams and loaded up with one of the most devastating counter-punches of his career, smashing Williams and sending him down for an eight count. The referee waved off the fight and Williams immediately launched a mild protest to the official and ringside judges but to no avail. He believed that the fight was stopped too early and he was not given more of an opportunity to demonstrate to the official that he was not disoriented after the knock-down. In a post fight in- ring interview, Williams appeared to be uninjured, spoke clearly, and expressed his disappointment that he was not given the opportunity to \\"show my stuff.\\" Williams also called for a rematch, however this never occurred. After the defeat by Tyson, Williams became a journeyman heavyweight. His other notable fights include losses to Larry Holmes, Tim Witherspoon, Tommy Morrison, and Frank Bruno, and wins against Bert Cooper and Trevor Berbick. Williams retired in 1997 with a professional record of 30-10-0-1 with 21 knockouts. == After retirement== Williams worked for Allied-SpectaGuard in New York City at the World Trade Center as a security agent and field supervisor. After the September 11 attacks, Williams worked for Verizon in Queens, New York, as a security guard. Later he worked for Forte Security Group in New York City, as a security guard at the Copacabana and Marquee nightclubs until he became ill. == Death == Williams died on April 7, 2013, of esophageal cancer. He was survived by a daughter, Carla, and a son, Daniel. He was predeceased by his 12-year-old daughter Nijah, who died of leukemia.http://www.boxing.com/ten_count_for_carl_the_truth_williams.html == References in popular culture == Williams was the inspiration for a parody character on the Fox program In Living Color, Carl \\"The Tooth\\" Williams, portrayed by Jamie Foxx, a boxer so named because he only had one tooth.

It is owned by Mitsui Fudosan. The structure is built in the international style and looks like a simple cuboid devoid of any ornamentation. The vertical façade consists of alternating narrow glass and limestone stripes. The glass stripes are created by windows and opaque spandrels, forming continuous areas that are washed by machines sliding down the façade. A seven-floor base wraps around the western portion of the building, and there is a sunken plaza with a large two-tier pool and fountains facing Sixth Avenue. In the plaza stands the bronze statue named Out to Lunch by John Seward Johnson II—of the same series as the one standing outside 270 Park Avenue. ==Background== The building was part of the later Rockefeller Center expansion (1960s-1970s) dubbed the \\"XYZ Buildings\\". Their plans were first drawn in 1963 by the Rockefeller family's architect, Wallace Harrison, of the architectural firm Harrison & Abramovitz. Their letters correspond to their height. 1251 Avenue of the Americas is the \\"X\\" Building as it is the tallest at 750 ft (229 m) and 54 stories, and was the first completed, in 1971. The \\"Y\\" is 1221 Avenue of the Americas, which was the second tower completed (1973) and is the second in height (674 ft and 51 stories). The \\"Z\\" Building, the shortest and the youngest, is 1211 Avenue of the Americas with 45 stories (592 ft). 1251 is the second-tallest building in the whole of Rockefeller Center, after 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Despite being one of the 100 tallest buildings in the United States, 1251 Avenue of the Americas is almost impossible to see from more than just a few blocks away as it is flanked on all sides by buildings over 500 feet tall. The result is that even though 1251 Avenue of the Americas is approximately as tall as the tallest buildings in cities such as Boston or Minneapolis, it has almost no presence on the New York City skyline. In 1989, Exxon announced that it was moving its headquarters and around 300 employees from New York City to the Las Colinas area of Irving, Texas. Exxon sold the Exxon Building, its former headquarters, to a unit of Mitsui Real Estate Development Co. Ltd. in 1986 for $610 million. John Walsh, president of Exxon subsidiary Friendswood Development Company, stated that Exxon left New York because the costs were too high. Its New York offices moved to Brooklyn; it no longer retains a presence in Rockefeller Center.Pearson, Anne and Ralph Bivins. \\"Exxon moving corporate headquarters to Dallas\\". Houston Chronicle.

Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time. ==Origins== Originally written in 1934 for Adios, Argentina, an unproduced 20th Century Fox film musical, \\"Don't Fence Me In\\" was based on text by Robert (Bob) Fletcher, a poet and engineer with the Department of Highways in Helena, Montana. Cole Porter, who had been asked to write a cowboy song for the 20th Century Fox musical, bought the poem from Fletcher for $250. Porter reworked Fletcher's poem, and when the song was first published, Porter was credited with sole authorship. Porter had wanted to give Fletcher co- authorship credit, but his publishers did not allow it. The original copyright publication notice dated October 10, 1944 and the copyright card dated and filed on October 12, 1944 in the U.S. Copyright Office solely lists words and music by Cole Porter. After the song became popular, however, Fletcher hired attorneys who negotiated his co-authorship credit in subsequent publications. Although it was one of the most popular songs of its time, Porter claimed it was his least favorite of his compositions. Porter's revision of the song retained quite a few portions of Fletcher's lyrics, such as “Give me land, lots of land”, “... breeze ... cottonwood trees”, “turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle,” “mountains rise ... western skies”, “cayuse”, “where the west commences,” and “... hobbles ... can’t stand fences,” but in some places modified them to give them “the smart Porter touch”. Porter replaced some lines, rearranged lyric phrases, and added two verses. (Porter's verses about Wildcat Kelly are not included in any of the hit recordings of the song but are used in the Roy Rogers film of the same title. Roy Rogers sings the first verse with the lyric \\"Wildcat Willy\\" when he performed it in 1944's Hollywood Canteen. Both verses are included in the Ella Fitzgerald https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6vmL2WFUjY and Harry Connick Jr.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGDCcRMLieg versions of the song.). ==Roy Rogers and \\"Don't Fence Me In\\"== Roy Rogers sang it in the 1944 Warner Bros. movie Hollywood Canteen. Many people heard the song for the first time when Kate Smith introduced it on her radio broadcast of October 8, 1944. In 1945, the song was sung again as the title tune of another Roy Rogers film, Don't Fence Me In (1945), in which Dale Evans plays a magazine reporter who comes to Roy Rogers' and Gabby Whittaker's (George \\"Gabby\\" Hayes) ranch to research her story about a legendary late gunslinger. When it's revealed that Whittaker is actually the supposedly dead outlaw, Rogers must clear his name. Rogers and The Sons of the Pioneers perform songs, including the Cole Porter title tune. The next year (1946), the Cole Porter biopic Night and Day used a clip from Hollywood Canteen of Rogers singing \\"Don't Fence Me In.\\" ==Bing Crosby version== Bing Crosby and The Andrews Sisters with Vic Schoen and his Orchestra recorded it in 1944, without having seen or heard the song. Crosby entered the studio on July 25, 1944. Within 30 minutes, he and the Andrews Sisters had completed the recording, which sold more than a million copies and topped the Billboard charts for eight weeks in 1944–45. This version also went to number nine on the Harlem Hit Parade chart. ==Frank Sinatra version== Frank Sinatra appeared on the Your Hit Parade program on December 23, 1944 and performed this song, which at the time was the #1 song in the country. The arrangement, written by both Lowell Martin (the first section of the arrangement) and Billy May (the second part including the shout chorus) was conducted by Axel Stordahl and the Lucky Strike Orchestra. Stordahl counted off the arrangement a little too fast and Sinatra could not keep up with the fast pace of the lyrics. As a result, he stumbled on the words \\"underneath the western skies.\\" Then, after the phrase \\"I want to ride to the ridge where the West commences\\" he utters \\"too many words,\\" most likely in an effort to explain his on-air slip-up. Shortly after his performance Sinatra was fired from the show supposedly due to his on-air comment about the lyrics. ==Other versions== * Labrinth sang it in a 2019 Super Bowl commercial for Mini. * John Barrowman sang it in his album \\"Swings Cole Porter\\" * Kate Smith also had a top ten hit with it in 1945. * Ella Fitzgerald recorded the song on her Verve Records album Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook (1956).

Being a cloth merchant by trade, in the 1840s he developed interest in photography and focused on technical and economical issues of mass production of photo prints. ==Biography== He was born and raised in LilleLance Day & Ian McNeil, (eds.). Biographical Dictionary of the History of Technology, 1995. where he studied chemistry with Charles Frédéric Kuhlmann and miniature painting on porcelain.Encyclopedia of nineteenth-century photography: A-I, Volume 1, edited by John Hannavy. New York: Taylor & Francis, 2007, pp. 167-168. After Louis Daguerre solved the problem of long exposure time and introduced daguerreotypy, a practical photographic process, to the general public in 1839, Blanquart-Evrard developed interest in photography. He studied the calotype, salt-print negative process, and in 1847 became the first person to publish on negative/positive paper photo process in France. He developed a method of bathing the paper in solutions of potassium iodide and silver nitrate rather than brushing these chemical baths on the surface.Salted Paper, Blanquart- Evrard processPhotomechanical plates in La photographie, ses origines, ses progrès, ses transformations, David A. Hanson Collection of the History of Photomechanical Reproduction In January 1847, he presented his research on stabilizing the photo prints by floating them in the silver solution to the French Academy of Sciences. ==Imprimerie Photographique== In 1850, he developed and introduced the albumen paper printing technique, which became the staple process of the soon to be popular carte de visite type of photo prints.Louis-desire Blanquart-evrard (1802-1872) Artwork Images, Exhibitions, Reviews In September 1851 in Lille, France, with Hippolyte Fockedey, he started the Imprimerie Photographique de Lille, which was the first large scale printing company to employ a large number of employees. Blanquart-Évrard introduced to public the work of many pioneering European photographers, such as Édouard Loydreau (1820-1905), Charles Marville (1813-1879), Ernest Benecke (1817-1894), Thomas Sutton (1819-1875), and Maxime Du Camp (1822-1894). In the 1850s he became known for publishing John Stewart's views of the Pyrenees and Auguste Saltzmann's views of Jerusalem. However, the calotype process that he adopted and improved had the disadvantage of leaving a blank white sky and dark foreground, which led to artist manipulating and using multiple negatives to add clouds to the sky and make the foreground more distinct. The problem with these manipulations was that often the clouds were taken in the morning and the foreground was taken in the afternoon. Also, due to technology deficiency, photo prints were fading with time and Blanquart-Evrard's business venture had to close in 1855, losing in competition with lithographs. ==Recognition== In 1860s, Blanquart-Evrard published several influential essays and books, including, On the intervention of art in photographyBlanquart-Evrard. On the Intervention of Art in Photography: With an Introduction by Thomas Sutton, Translated from the French by Alfred Harral. London: Sampson Low, Son & Co, 1864. and La photographie: ses origines, ses progrès, ses transformationsBlanquart-Evrard. La photographie: ses origines, ses progrès, ses transformations. Lille: Imprimerie L. Danel, 1870. where he described the first three decades of the progress of photography and formulated important for the future development of photography as a fine art theoretical and aesthetic ideas. He is now considered as a major figure of the 1850s, a golden decade in the development of photography. ==Referenceser reading== * Louis-Désiré Blanquart-Evrard, Traité de photographie sur papier, Librairie encyclopédique Roret, 1851 * Louis-Désiré Blanquart Evrard, Intervention de l'art dans la photographie, Leiber, 1864 ==External links== * Louis Désiré Blanquart-Evrard, The J.

Cudjoe operates his own galleries in Accra and Takoradi, Ghana. James Cudjoe's work draws on images from everyday life. He is known for his cityscapes, which range from vibrant, colorful and energetic (such as Hot Day (in Osu), see right) to calm, placid and subdued (such as New Beginnings I. He is also known to depict the African market woman, a figure he says represents his own mother, in scenes of labor or rest, such as Dancer (see right), or the working woman of Good Returns III. Fans of his work find these paintings evocative, emotional and relatable. His growing popularity and success in Europe and the United States, as well as many other locations across the globe, is a testament to his skill and importance as an artist. In May 2007, James Cudjoe was featured in an exhibition at the San Diego Museum of Man, Artists Speak: Contemporary art from Ghana and Zimbabwe.

Its initial mission was to return the National Football League (NFL) to Baltimore. Maryland sought a new football team after former Baltimore Colts owner, Robert Irsay, moved the Colts out of the city in the middle of a snowy night on March 29, 1984.\\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\" documentary on ESPN, 2008-12-13 The Authority is a public corporation of Maryland which is authorized to issue tax-exempt bonds for financing its operations. The proceeds from the sale of those bonds and any other revenues collected are deposited in the Maryland Stadium Authority Financing Fund. ==Goals and responsibilities== Since its creation, the MSA broadened its goals and responsibilities. Soon after its incorporation, it sought to negotiate a long-term lease with the Baltimore Orioles, its last remaining professional sports team (Baltimore also lost the Bullets to suburban Washington, D.C. (Landover, Maryland) in the early 1970s). In 1992, under the auspices of the MSA, Orioles Park at Camden Yards was opened. The MSA continued to work toward acquiring a new NFL team. The city was courted by the owners of teams such as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the New Orleans Saints, the St. Louis Cardinals, the Los Angeles Rams, only to be repeatedly disappointed. Baltimore thought it had its best shot in the 1993 NFL Expansion, but the league decided to put teams in Charlotte, North Carolina and Jacksonville, Florida, smaller cities in the south. The city finally acquired the old Cleveland Browns team in 1995 under the leadership of John Moag, Chairman of the Maryland Stadium Authority at the time. Ironically, the other remaining areas seeking an NFL team, St. Louis and Tennessee all acquired teams through relocations. The Los Angeles Rams moved to St. Louis and the Houston Oilers temporarily relocated to Memphis, Tennessee before moving to their new stadium in Nashville. All three teams that relocated made it to the Super Bowl soon after they moved, St. Louis and Tennessee in 2000 and Baltimore in 2001. Some other projects that the MSA has been tasked to handle are: * Oriole Park at Camden Yards * Baltimore Convention Center expansion * Hippodrome Theatre renovation * M&T; Bank Stadium, home of the Baltimore Ravens * Memorial Stadium, former home of the Baltimore Orioles * Ocean City Convention Center * Ripken Stadium in Aberdeen, Maryland * University of Maryland parking garage * Xfinity Center (formerly Comcast Center), basketball arena for the Maryland Terrapins ==Authority composition== The Maryland Stadium Authority is governed by a 7-member board of directors, all of whom serve 4-year terms. Six directors are appointed by the governor with one appointment by Baltimore's mayor: { class= - !Name !Term End !Appointer - Thomas Kelso (Chair) 2023 governor - Leonard J.

He was active in the transition efforts from military to civilian rule in Sierra Leone. As the National Chairman of the National Alliance Democratic Party (NADP), he was an unsuccessful candidate in the 1996 Presidential elections. ==Early life== Sillah was born on December 12, 1949 in Massam Kpaka, Pujehun District, British Sierra Leone to Acting Paramount Chief Alhaji Yahya Sillah of Dama Chiefdom, Kenema District and Haja Mamie Zoe Mansaray. == Career  Journalism=== Mohamed Yahya Sillah started his career in journalism in 1978 as Senior Reporter with the Liberian News Agency (LINA), Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in Monrovia, Liberia. He became Managing Editor of Third World News at the Atlanta Voice Newspaper, Atlanta, Georgia, USA in 1981. In 1983, he founded the African World News magazine in Atlanta, Georgia. === First Liberian Civil War === In 1990, Sillah traveled to Liberia to cover the First Liberian Civil War for African World News. He reported about rebels drinking human blood from freshly slaughtered civilians. Hunger relief efforts Thousands of Sierra Leoneans were stranded in Liberia during the war. The Sierra Leone embassy in Monrovia closed and the Sierra Leone government under president Joseph Saidu Momoh (APC) declared its inability to rescue the stranded Sierra Leoneans. He worked with other concerned Sierra Leonean refugees to take charge at the embassy. Sillah negotiated with the rebels to sell bags of rice that he purchased and distributed for free to all refugees at the embassy. Evacuation  As the assault on the embassy intensified, Sillah undertook to rescue those stranded in the embassy and convey them to safety at Monrovia's free port facility. He did so by paying combatant factions with his own money to facilitate passage through ambush points along the way. He succeeded evacuating all the refugees with the help of ECOMOG soldiers less than an hour before a rebel missile destroyed the embassy. At the Monrovia Freeport, Sillah formed the Sierra Leone Evacuation Organization. He aided in the successful evacuation of approximately 5000 people to Freetown over a period of 90 days via the Nigerian gunboat known as The Ambe, earning him the nickname 'Junior Moses'. ===National Alliance Democratic Party=== The leadership ability Sillah demonstrated attracted the attention of American diplomats in Monrovia, Liberia. He entered politics in 1995 and became the Party Leader and National Chairman of the National Alliance Democratic Party (NADP). He also began his campaign for the Sierra Leone presidency the same year. 1996 presidential campaign Sillah ran as the NADP candidate in the 1996 Presidential elections. He received 0.5% of the votes (3,723 total votes). He contested the election results on BBC's Focus on Africa. === Activism against deportation of Sierra Leoneans in the US === In 2004, Sillah opposed the deportation of Sierra Leoneans from the United States after the US withdrew their protective privilege known as Temporary protected status (TPS). He made an appeal to the US government on their behalf. Sillah won the support of Georgia Congressman John Lewis, who sent a request to the Secretary of Homeland Security urging them to reconsider the TPS issue, which led to a reprieve for the refugees. === Support for Paul Kamara === In 2004, as NADP leader Sillah protested the imprisonment of Sierra Leonean journalist, Paul Kamara, editor of For Di People Newspaper. Sillah viewed Kamara's imprisonment and the subsequent banning of his newspaper as a breach of the SLPP government’s commitment to freedom of the press and the constitutional exercise of free speech. He criticized President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah for allowing the imprisonment of Kamara and held that the exercise of democracy and the protection of human rights were fundamental to people's right to free speech. ===2007 Presidential and Parliamentary elections=== In 2007 Sillah withdrew his bid for national leadership in the Presidential and Parliamentary elections, citing inadequate funding and ineffective campaign management. He supported the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP) presidential candidate, Vice President Solomon Berewa, who lost the election. Sillah congratulated the winning candidate, Ernest Bai Koroma of the All People's Congress (APC) party. He vowed to respect any Sierra Leonean who was legitimately and democratically elected to office. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1949 births Category:National Alliance Democratic Party politicians Category:Sierra Leonean journalists Category:Sierra Leonean activists Category:People from Pujehun District ","title":"Mohamed Sillah"},{"id":"6237919","text":"Derrick \\"Smoke\\" Gainer (born August 22, 1972, in Pensacola, Florida) is a US born boxer who started out in the featherweight division and now fights in the lightweight division.

Crawford took 50% of the claim for himself. Crawford at the time was working as a part of President Zachary Taylor's cabinet. ==Background== George Galphin was an Irish immigrant and an Indian trader. He was very successful and respected for his work. He had a large land claim in what became the territory of Georgia, but after his death and the Revolutionary War the colonial government took claim over the Galphin estate. Arguing they were due compensation for their losses during war time, the Galphin family fought the US Government in litigation for over 70 years but it wasn't until the early 1840s that any financial compensation was received. ==Resolving the claim== Georgia's Governor, George Crawford, took up the case helping the Galphin family fight for their estate, under the agreement to keep 50% of the claim for himself. During his last days in office as Governor, the claim went through Congress and going almost completely unnoticed it passed into law. The law directed the Secretary of Treasury to pay the dues for the estate. Crawford was to receive $43,518.97; this was the principal of the claim (no interest was allowed). In 1849, Zachary Taylor asked George Crawford to be a part of his cabinet. He became Secretary of War and from that position he gained many new connections and allies. He brought up the case to United States Attorney General Reverdy Johnson and Secretary of the Treasury William Meredith. The Galphin family and Crawford demanded that interest be paid on the estate. At the time Congress was in session, but the three officials decided to settle the claim on their own. On May 2, 1850, the Secretary of Treasury paid out $192,352.89 for the land and interest. William Meredith kept $3,000 for himself while Crawford kept $94,176.44. ==Afterwards== When the public found out about the Galphin estate's resolution they were outraged. This led to Crawford's resignation and though the public demanded an investigation, there never was a punishment for the Secretary of War or his allies. Crawford retired and lived off the money he made from the settlement. ==References== New Georgia Encyclopedia History of the United States from the compromise of 1850 by James Ford Rhodes The Galphin claim by Edward Stanly Category:History of the United States (1849–1865) ","title":"Galphin Affair"},{"id":"6237936","text":"Badrock (formerly Bedrock) is a fictional comic book superhero who appears in books published by Image Comics. Created by Rob Liefeld, he first appeared in Youngblood #1 (April 1992). ==Fictional character biography== Thomas John McCall was an average underachieving 16-year-old. When he swallowed a vial of top secret genetic material in his father's lab, a transformation occurred, and McCall's body became a mass of granite-like organic rock while still exhibiting the emotional immaturity of a 16-year-old. Later, Thomas assumed the identity of Badrock when he was recruited to join the high-profile government superteam, Youngblood. Badrock has been a part of every incarnation of the Youngblood team to date (1992, 1995, and 2008 series as well as the Team Youngblood and Youngblood Strikefile series). Badrock is proficient with a number of weapons, including the many guns and knives available to him in the Youngblood arsenal. Not one to hide behind gadgetry, however, Badrock often uses the incredible power of his fists to pummel opponents into submission. Despite his massive size, Badrock's reflexes exceed normal human levels.\\"Youngblood Battlezone\\" #2 (1994) Badrock is impulsive, having picked dangerous, property-damaging fights with the police officer Savage Dragon and Mighty Man. The Dragon fight was a test to see if he was up to joining Youngblood. Instead, Dragon arrests him.\\"Savage Dragon\\" #3 (1992) Being one of the most popular members of Youngblood (both in the fictional Image Universe and with real-life comic readers), Badrock starred in more spin-off comics than any other member of the team.Badrock @ Grand Comics Database Many of Badrock's non-Youngblood adventures involve his father, Dr. Joseph McCall, and his mother, Angela McCall, with whom he has a close and loving relationship. He starred in his own team-up book entitled Badrock and Company which lasted for six issues and paired him with other Image heroes, all of whom were creations of one of Image's other studios. These included Pitt (Full Bleed Studios), Fuji of Stormwatch (WildStorm), Mighty Man (Highbrow Entertainment), Velocity (Top Cow Productions), Grifter of the Wildcats (also from WildStorm) and Shadowhawk (ShadowLine).\\"Badrock and Company\\" #1-6 (1994) Badrock's adventures involved threats to national security, such as Youngblood rescuing (what seemed to be) Vice President Dan Quayle from the WildC.A.T.s.\\"WildC.A.T.s\\" #3 (December 1992) Badrock, in one of his many solo adventures, visits Hell, confronting Spawn's old enemy, the Violator. This was after being named temporary security head of a scientific installation that was investigating the realm of Hell. He was more responsible at this point, trying to protect the many innocent people who had unwittingly made the trip to Hell with him. He had to deal with the interference of heavenly and hellish agents and the unwillingness of some of the humans to actually obey his orders. At one point, Violator tricks Badrock into freeing him because the heavenly agent that had torn into the building was willing to kill anyone and everyone. Violator uses his human form to convince the angel Celestine that Badrock is the demon. The hero is defeated and the angel is fatally injured. She manages to keep it together until her life force returns Badrock and the innocent humans back to Earth.\\"Violator Vs. Badrock\\" #1–4 (1995) Around this time, and in a follow-up to the story from Badrock and Company #5, Badrock teams up with Grifter to save his mother, Angela, who has once again been captured by the Covenant of the Sword. The story further explores the fact that Grifter once had an intimate relationship with Badrock's mom.Grifter/Badrock #1–2 (October–November 1995) Only two issues of the limited series were produced, even though the story was incomplete and promised \\"To Be Continued...\\". ===Murder=== Badrock is part of a vital effort of keeping reality from duplicating itself in the Shattered Image limited series.\\"Shattered Image\\" #1–4 (1996) Around this time. his teammate Riptide is found murdered in her bedroom; Badrock is part of the group that takes custody of her seeming killer, Knightsabre.Judgement Day #1–3 (June 1997–October 1997) When Youngblood was disbanded after the death of Riptide, Badrock took some time off. It did not last long though, and through a series of events, he became part of the fourth incarnation of Brigade (although the series, published by Liefeld's company, Awesome Comics, only lasted one issue). He also joins another incarnation of Youngblood, this one based out of 'Liberty Island'. He joins with Shaft, Cougar, Diehard, Doc Rocket, and Johnny Panic. During his time with the team, he is injured and must use crutches. He also confronts evil, super-powered doubles of his parents. The entire team confronts a government controlled 'super-villain' team; each member of Youngblood has a focus-tested 'rival'.\\"Youngblood\\" #1–4 (2008) In the year 3000, Badrock was still alive and returned for a brief period of time to get some help from Youngblood to stop the Katellans. The continued attempts of the Katellans to reacquire the defector Combat back led to the destruction of Earth, Katella, and Acura in Badrock's timeline. Badrock then returned to 1995 where he prevented this from occurring. The mission succeeded.\\"Team Youngblood\\" #20 (1995) Badrock also starred in three inter-company crossovers with Marvel Comics. Badrock and Wolverine of the X-Men joined forces to battle the Savage Land Mutates.\\"Badrock/Wolverine\\" #1 (1996) While being interviewed for the Daily Bugle, Badrock teamed up with Spider-Man to take on Spidey's rogues' gallery, thanks to the illusions of Mysterio.\\"Spider-Man/Badrock\\" #1–2 (1997) As a member of Youngblood, Badrock and his pals teamed up with X-Force to battle the media madness of Mojo\\"Youngblood/X-Force\\" and \\"X-Force/Youngblood\\" (1996) Badrock is also part of the 'Image United' crossover that began in November 2009.

The mane runs from the poll to the withers. On horses, the mane is the hair that grows from the top of the neck of a horse or other equine, reaching from the poll to the withers, and includes the forelock or foretop. It is thicker and coarser than the rest of the horse's coat, and naturally grows to roughly cover the neck. Heredity plays a role, giving some horses a longer, thicker mane, and others a shorter, thinner one. Some horses, such as those used in circuses or in mounted displays such as Cavalia, have manes allowed to grow down to their knees. Others have their manes deliberately shaved completely off for style or practical purposes. When ungroomed, however, the mane usually grows no longer than the width of the horse's neck, as natural wear and tear limit its potential length. The mane is thought to keep the neck warm, and possibly to help water run off the neck if the animal cannot obtain shelter from the rain. It also provides some fly protection to the front of the horse, although the tail is usually the first defense against flies. These are not the original purposes. The longer mane is a specifically bred gene defect (Hypertrichosis) in order to optimise the visual part for humans. Ponies usually have the thickest manes, with horse breeds having tremendous variation in thickness and length. Other equids such as the donkey often have very sparse, thin manes. ==Grooming== A horse with a \\"natural\\" mane. Though some thick manes have a natural wave, a mane grown out this long is kept in long braids when the horse is not being shown in order to protect it from breaking off. All domesticated horses benefit from having their manes and tails untangled regularly to remove dirt, tangles and debris. Horses with short manes usually have their manes combed, while horses with longer manes are usually groomed with a human hair brush or a stiff dandy brush. Horses with extraordinarily long manes may have their manes hand picked to remove tangles. For a horse show, the horse is generally bathed, and this includes the mane. However, in addition to a shampoo bath, many grooms of long-maned horses also use a conditioner or cream rinse on the mane to improve shine and manageability, though for horses with braided manes, the mane may be left alone or have gels that increase stiffness and body added instead. To make a short mane grow long and lie flat, or to make a naturally full mane grow beyond the length it might normally reach in nature, the mane can be placed into six or seven thick, moderately loose braids to prevent breaking. Many horse show exhibitors of long-maned horses also like the wavy look of a mane that has been kept braided until just before a show and may loosely braid a naturally long mane the night before a show just to obtain a fuller, wavy appearance. Beyond basic care, the mane is styled in various ways, depending on the breed of horse, part of the world, and the equestrian discipline of the rider. The basic ways to style the mane include: *Natural, which includes manes conditioned to grow extremely long *Pulled or thinned, where small clumps of hairs are pulled out along the underside of the neck until the mane is long and thin enough to lie flat against the neck. *Braided (USA) or plaited (UK), seen primarily in English riding. *Banded, divided into many small sections with a small rubber band placed around each, seen on some breeds used for Western riding. *\\"Roached\\" or \\"hogged\\": shaven off down to the neck. Regardless of style, many manes that are not roached have a bit of mane at the poll, the area immediately behind the ears, shaved in order to help the crownpiece of the bridle lie more neatly on the head. This area is called a 'bridle path'. It may vary in length from one inch to over a foot. The length of the bridle path is dependent on the discipline or breed of the horse, and is important to consider when grooming a horse for competition. ===Discipline=== Hunter braids. A banded mane. Note that mane also has been pulled and thinned prior to banding *Pleasure riding: usually the mane is kept natural or pulled, as preferred by the rider. *Hunt seat: the mane is pulled to about , and braided with \\"hunter braids\\" for all important competition (usually on the right side). When the mane is braided, the forelock should also be braided. *Show jumping: the mane may be braided (usually with \\"button braids\\", although a nicely pulled mane is acceptable. The forelock may or may not be braided. *Dressage: the mane is usually pulled and braided for all recognized competition, braiding is seen on either side of the neck. The forelock is sometimes left unbraided, especially in the case of stallions. Baroque breeds or other horses with long manes may compete in dressage with the mane \\"French Braided\\" in a long, continuous braid which follows the curve of the neck. *Eventing: pulled. Braided for dressage with \\"knob\\" or \\"button braids\\" (although not always at the lower levels). Usually left unbraided for cross-country, as the rider may need to grab it. May be braided for stadium (usually at the higher levels). *Western pleasure: usually pulled, usually a bit shorter than for English disciplines, and \\"banded\\" (rubber bands placed around small sections of mane) for stock breeds such as the American Quarter Horse, left unpulled and natural for other breeds *Reining and cutting: usually natural, forelock may be braided. *Stock seat equitation: Same as western pleasure. *Saddle seat: Natural, although a few long braids (usually forelock and 1 or 2 in the mane) are permitted on gaited breeds and on American Saddlebreds, usually with a colorful ribbon attached that complements the rider's clothing. Three-gaited Saddlebreds have roached manes; in five- gaited Saddlebreds the mane is left long, with a long bridle path. *Fox hunting: pulled and braided, usually on the right side. *Combined driving: Usually styled according to breed. Pulled and braided for sport horses. *Polo: roached, to keep it out of the way of the mallet. *Flat racing or steeplechase: pulled, sometimes braided. *Harness racing: pulled or natural, Standardbreds often with a long bridle path. *Endurance riding: usually left natural, although it varies according to breed. ===Breed=== Button braids Certain breeds are often expected to have a specific styling to their manes. Common styles for the United States are as follows: *Baroque breeds, such as the Andalusian, Lusitano, and Friesian, usually have their manes left natural, and as long as possible, though in some horse show competition, the manes may be put in French braids down the crest of the neck. *Saddlebred: Usually left long and natural, with \\"5-gaited\\" and pleasure horses having braiding in the forelock and first lock of mane. Roached for \\"3-Gaited\\" park horses. *National Show Horse: long and natural, with long bridle path, usually *Arabian and part-Arabian: long, unbraided, and natural in all events, with a long bridle path, except for horses shown in hunt seat classes. If the horse shows in multiple disciplines where a long mane is generally mandatory, the mane is French braided for dressage, show hack, or hunt seat competition, but if the animal is shown only as a hunter, jumper or in dressage, the mane may be pulled and braided. *Connemara: pulled and may be braided *Morgan: long and natural, braiding only in dressage and hunt seat classes. Usually has a long bridle path *Stock horse type (includes Quarter Horse, Paint horse, Appaloosa): bridle path usually cut to the length of the horse's ear laid back against the neck (), pulled mane, usually banded for Western pleasure and halter, braided for hunter competition. Usually kept long and natural for reining and cutting. Length varies for rodeo competition, often left long in some speed events, sometimes roached for roping events so that rope does not tangle in the mane. *Warmbloods: pulled mane, usually braided (either side). Short bridle path in length. *Thoroughbred: pulled with short bridle path. May be braided depending on discipline. *Shetland Pony: long mane with bridle path, may have a lock of mane braided. *Icelandic horse: nowadays manes are left untrimmed, bridle path clipping is inappropriate. Thick and long manes are preferred. *Fjord horse: breed standard for show dictates the mane to be roached to flatter the topline. Usually not cut extremely close to the neck. *Finnhorse: mane and tail are left natural for conformational showing. They may be, but rarely are, braided for other disciplines. ==Pulling== A shortened or \\"pulled\\" mane. The mane is often pulled to shorten and thin it. It gives a much neater appearance than simply trimming it with scissors, which does not thin the mane enough to braid and creates an unnatural line. Pulling also makes the mane more manageable, as a pulled mane is less likely to get tangled than a natural one. Most horses do not object to mane pulling, and willingly stand for the process. To make it more comfortable for the horse, a groom should pull the mane out of the crest in an upwards direction, rather than sideways or down. An application of Orajel or clove oil on the roots of the mane can help desensitize the area during the pulling process. It is also recommended that pulling is performed right after exercise, when it is thought that the mane comes out more easily because the pores are open. Using a mane pulling device such as the ManePuller may also be considered because it tends to be quicker and therefore less stressful for the horse (and groom). In some cases, a horse is very sensitive and may constantly toss its head or try to bite if the groom attempts to pull the mane. In this case, only a few hairs should be taken out at a time, with the pulling process spanning over several days, and the groom should try to keep up with the process so that the horse will not have to endure a long session right before competition. Competitors in a hurry sometime use thinning shears to trim the mane and give the appearance of having been pulled. However, the effect only lasts a couple of weeks at most before the cut hairs begin to grow out and stick up straight into the air. Thus, this method is not advised. Pulled manes also grow out, but take longer, and when the hair begins to grow, it is less stiff and tends to blend more easily with the existing mane. ==Roaching (USA) or hogging (UK)== Roached mane and forelock Roaching or hogging is when the mane, and sometimes forelock, is completely shaven. This is usually done if a horse's mane is quite ragged, or for certain disciplines such as polo, polocrosse, and calf roping, to keep the mane out of the way. Cobs can be shown with a roached mane and it is also common to roach the mane for certain breeds. In Spain, breeders commonly roach the mane of mares and foals. The same applies to the Swiss Freiberger horses. The American Saddlebred \\"3-Gaited\\" horse is often shown with a roached mane, while the \\"5-Gaited\\" Saddlebred is shown with a full mane. If a mane is roached, it can take for it to stop sticking straight up in the air and lie over onto the neck, and a year or more to return to a natural length. For this reason, manes that are roached usually need to be kept that way, though occasionally roaching a damaged mane and allowing it to grow out evenly is effective as a last resort for a mane that has been partly torn out, badly tangled or otherwise cannot be restored to a smooth condition. ==Braiding (USA) or plaiting (UK)== Horse with a French braided mane, also sometimes called an \\"Andalusian\\" braid \\"Continental\\" or \\"macrame\\" braid Today, braiding is performed to show off the neck, accentuating the top line when the horse is moving or jumping. Braiding may be used to hide conformation faults of the neck (for example, a relatively short neck can be braided with a greater number of smaller braids, making it look longer). Braiding can be used to train the mane to lie on one side of the neck, if half falls on one side and half falls on the other. Traditionally, the mane is braided on the right side of the neck. This is still the standard for show hunters in the United States and eventers, although dressage horses are commonly braided on either side. It was also traditional in the USA that male horses would have an odd number of braids, and even number for mares.Disston,Harry. All About Horses Bramhall House U.S., 1961 ASIN: B001EO322E However, this rule is rarely, if ever, followed by modern braiders. ===Types of braids=== An \\"Andalusian\\" or French braided mane on an Andalusian horse. *The most common braids in both the United States and the United Kingdom are button braids, which are round and usually larger (thus fewer in number) than hunter, or \\"flat\\" braids. In the UK, show horses of all types are plaited with between 9 and , similar to the American \\"button braid\\". An odd number of plaits is traditional, although judges have become more relaxed about this in recent years. The number of plaits can be increased or decreased, depending on whether the rider wants the horse's neck to look longer or shorter. *Hunter braids or flat braids are smaller, with as many as 20–30 on a neck, and they are the only braid considered traditional in US hunt seat competition. They are usually not seen in other disciplines, although they are permissible for dressage. *Knob braids are a variation on hunter braids, involving pushing part of the braid up to create a \\"knob\\" at the top. They are usually seen in dressage competition, though are also popular in other flat classes—particularly at breed shows—as well as jumpers. *The French braid, also called an \\"Andalusian\\" braid, is braided along the crest of the neck. It is used on long-maned horses, and is usually seen either when a baroque horse breed competes in dressage, or in hunter and dressage classes for horses that are otherwise required to show with a long, full mane. *The Continental braid, also called a \\"macrame braid\\", is also useful for long-maned horses, and creates a \\"net\\" in the mane. It isn't a \\"braid\\" per se, as it is usually made up of simple knots or even simply created with rubber bands or yarn, but is periodically viewed as stylish in some dressage and flat classes, particularly those in breed shows for horses that have naturally long manes. *The scalloped mane is a less common form of braiding, where each braid is pulled up under the one which is two down from it (toward the withers), forming a series of loops.

C-142 The original call letters were WSKNConstruction permit, FCC file number BR-3284, WSKN 920 kc Saugerties, NY dated May 1955 licensed to Saugerties, New York with 1000 watts of power, for daytime broadcasting only. Its transmitter and studio were located on the Glasco Turnpike, in the Town of Saugerties. In March 1960 the call letters were changed to WGHQ, the City of License was changed to Kingston, the transmitter site was moved to Route 9W, just south of Port Ewen, NY. The station's operating power was increased to 5,000 watts, still as a daytimer.License renewal application, FCC file number BR-3284, WGHQ, Kingston, NY dated May 12, 1960 WGHQ was the second radio station licensed to Kingston (after WKNY). In 1965, WGHQ-FM was licensed on (later the original WBPM, now WKXP) 94.3 MHz. It was a full-time simulcast the AM's programming for much of the next decade. From its inception, WGHQ aired a somewhat Kingston-centric full service middle of the road format which had a vast daytime advantage to WKNY, but WKNY was a full-time station. WGHQ kept its focus but rising costs and the decline of full service formats on AM forced the station to drop much of its news coverage and change to an all music format. In 1988, WGHQ was licensed for 78 watts nighttime power, however, the station dropped local programming, going instead to mainly satellite syndicated music programming. WGHQ aired Adult Standards for most of the 1990s. In 1999 the family sold WGHQ and WBPM to WRWD/WBWZ local radio owner Roberts Radio Group. This began a period of multiple format changes. Roberts Radio sold to Clear Channel in mid-2000. WGHQ became a talk radio station under Clear Channel ownership, airing syndicated talk shows including Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck. WGHQ along with WBPM 92.9 MHz was sold to Pamal Broadcasting in April 2007 Pamal Broadcasting changed the format from talk radio back to Adult Standards in July 2007, simulcasting with co-owned WBNR and WLNA, but keeping locally originated \\"Kingston Community Radio,\\" produced by Walter Maxwell, in its 7-9 am time slot. See www.mykcr.org In March 2008 the tri-mulcast of WBNR, WLNA and WGHQ changed to a service-oriented talk radio format under the name \\"Hudson Valley Talk Radio.\\" HVTR featured non-political syndicated advice hosts Gary Goldberg (financial), Dr. Laura Schlesinger (life advice), Dave Ramsey (Money management) as well as local experts under time brokered arrangements. On December 20, 2013, Pamal announced that Tri-State Public Communications, which operates WHDD in Sharon, Connecticut and WLHV in Annandale-on-Hudson as public radio station Robin Hood Radio, would acquire WGHQ through a donation. As of January 1, 2014 WGHQ was re-transmitting Robin Hood Radio programming except during the 7-9 AM time slot Monday thru Friday when The \\"Kingston Community Radio\\" program airs on WGHQ. A local marketing agreement or LMA was in effect until paperwork was filed and approved by the FCC for the donation of WGHQ to Robin Hood Radio.

On June 28, 2016, Pamal Broadcasting removed two of three towers at the WGHQ transmitter site due to the poor physical condition of the towers. The station power was reduced to 1000 watts daytime, 38 watts nighttime non-directional from the remaining tower.

He was League of Ireland Top Scorer on three occasions in 1951–52, 1952–53 and 1955–56. ==Gaelic football== Gibbons was born in Dublin. His mother was from County Wicklow and his father came from County Kildare. His father and brothers had played Gaelic football at inter–county level. As a youth Gibbons was also a prominent Gaelic footballer. He captained Parnells in a Dublin Junior Football Championship final and was in the Parnells team that lost to St Vincents in the 1950 Dublin Senior Football Championship final. At 17 he was also selected as a substitute for the Dublin county team's senior panel. ==Association footballEarly years=== As a schoolboy and youth Gibbons played association football for Dublin City U14s, Home Farm U16s and Bohemians U19. He also had a trial with Hull City. Gibbons initially played as a centre half, however in a youth trial game against a Liverpool FA XI he switched to centre-forward. Gibbons made his League of Ireland debut with Bohemians as a replacement for Mick O'Flanagan before joining Whitehall Rangers of the Athletic Union League and helping them win the Leinster Junior Cup. ===St Patrick's Athletic=== Gibbons joined St Patrick's Athletic in 1950 when they were still playing in the Leinster Senior League. In 1950–51 he helped St Pat's win the Leinster title and they were subsequently invited to join the League of Ireland. In 1951–52 Gibbons scored 26 goals in 22 games, including four hat-tricks, and finished the season as the League of Ireland Top Scorer. His goals also helped St Pat's win their first League of Ireland title in their debut season. In 1952–53 he was again league top scorer with 22 goals in 22 games. This included five he scored in a 6–2 win against Cork Athletic. He also had a sixth goal disallowed. This remains the most goals scored by a St Pat's player in a single game. In 1954–55 Gibbons scored 28 goals as St Pat's won the league for the second time. This remains the most goals scored by a St Pat's player in a single season. In 1955–56 he topped the league scoring charts for a third time with 21 goals as St Pat's won a third League of Ireland title in their first five seasons in the league. With 108 goals he remains St Pat's all-time top league goal scorer. ===Later career=== After short spells with Holyhead Town and Cork Hibernians, Gibbons joined Dundalk for the 1958–59 season, scoring twice in his Oriel Park debut against Cork Hibernians in a League of Ireland Shield game. He went on to score seven goals in his first five appearances for Dundalk. Gibbons finished the season with 23 goals in 37 appearances in all competitions. ==International career== Gibbons represented the Republic of Ireland at youth, junior, inter-league and senior levels. Between 1952 and 1955 Gibbons made four senior international appearances. He made his senior debut in a 3–0 away defeat in a friendly against Germany on 4 May 1952. He was the only League of Ireland player in the starting eleven. He won his second cap on 28 October 1953 in a 4–0 win at Dalymount Park against Luxembourg in a 1954 World Cup qualifier. He won his third cap on 19 October 1955 in a 4–1 defeat at home to Yugoslavia. This was the match that Archbishop McQuaid tried to get banned. He won his final cap in a 2–2 draw with Spain on 27 November 1955. ==Honours== ;St Patrick's Athletic *League of Ireland: 3 ** 1951–52, 1954–55, 1955–56 *Dublin City Cup: 2 **1953–54, 1955–56 *LFA President's Cup: 3 **1952–53, 1953–54, 1955–56 *Leinster Senior League: 6 ** 1950–51 ;Individual *League of Ireland Top Scorer 3: ** 1951–52, 1952–53, 1955–56 ==References== Category:1929 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Association football forwards Category:Republic of Ireland association footballers Category:Republic of Ireland international footballers Category:Home Farm F.C. players Category:Bohemian F.C. players Category:St Patrick's Athletic F.C. players Category:Cork Hibernians F.C. players Category:Dundalk F.C. players Category:Holyhead Town F.C. players Category:Leinster Senior League (association football) players Category:League of Ireland players Category:League of Ireland XI players Category:Association footballers from County Dublin Category:Dublin inter-county Gaelic footballers Category:Gaelic footballers who switched code Category:Parnells Gaelic footballers (Dublin) ","title":"Shay Gibbons"},{"id":"6237979","text":"Michael A.

Built from 1830-1833, the canal linked two Finger Lakes: Keuka and Seneca lakes. The name refers to the unusual shape of Keuka Lake, which was formerly called \\"Crooked Lake\\". ==History== Encouraged by local farmers and businessmen who expected returns from a canal linking the two lakes, the state authorized a canal survey in this area in 1828. It authorized construction in 1829. From 1830 to 1833, the canal and its locks were built along the Keuka Outlet, a natural stream connecting the two lakes. The Crooked Lake Canal ran under 8 miles/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89d0e43214ebc2d3:0xb2c29ec9cf2e91d3!8m2!3d42.6609026!4d-77.0538577 Google Maps, between Dresden on the west shore of Seneca Lake and Penn Yan at the northeast end of Keuka Lake, through a system of twenty-eight locks. By contrast, the entire Erie Canal (360 miles) had 90 locks at this time. The drop between Keuka Lake and Seneca Lake was a steep 270 feet. The final cost was $157,000. The canal opened in 1833 and immediately spurred economic growth in the region. It soon had to compete with newly constructed railroads though, which could offer faster service. Mill owners along the outlet stream had complaints about a lack of water throughout the operation of the canal. The original wooden locks soon rotted and were due for replacement with stone, at a cost of over $107,000. http://www.crookedlakereview.com/articles/1_33/24mar1990/24dumas.html After years of unprofitability, the waterway was officially abandoned in 1877. Its holdings were taken over by railroads. In 1972, the rail line along the canal was destroyed in flooding and related damage from Hurricane Agnes. Later, the canal right-of-way was purchased for recreational use. The former route of the canal is partly marked as the modern Keuka Outlet Trail for hiking and biking. == See also == * List of canals in New York ==Referencesrnal links == * Crooked Lake Canal, History, University of Rochester * Keuka Outlet Trail * eastern end * western end Category:Canals in New York (state) Category:Tourist attractions in Yates County, New York Category:Canals opened in 1833 Category:1833 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Crooked Lake Canal"},{"id":"6238013","text":"Miguel Gonzalez (; born September 25, 1987) is an American soccer player of Mexican descent.

He was Medo Pucić's cousin, and a good friend of Marko Bruerović. He also held the position of Mayor of Dubrovnik during the French Empire. Sorkočević was born in Dubrovnik. His father was Luka Sorkočević and mother, Paula Bonda (1743-1811). Like his father, he was a composer. Antun studied in Rome, and after 1806 led the Republic of Ragusa's diplomatic representation in Paris where he was the last ambassador of the Republic in France, where he spent 35 years of his life. In Paris he wrote Postanak i propast Republike Dubrovačke (The Rise and Fall of the Republic of Dubrovnik) in which he proposed that Dubrovnik should join Boka Kotorska, Montenegro and Serbia to make it one nation. The pamphlet was banned in Austria. He also put forth the idea of creating a separate region comprising the Republic and Boka Kotorska under the Austrian Empire after French occupation of these lands (Illyrian provinces). Antun first married Catterina Schneider in 1820 in Venice. His second wife was Paola Labbia from Venice. He had one daughter, Maria (b. 1812), whose mother remains unknown.B.Kovačević, Posljednji Dubravčanin, st.90-91 Author of numerous publications, he became a member of Académie Celtique in 1806 and the Société des Antiquaires in 1828. Among other books he published such as Mémoire sur la langue et les moeurs des peuples slaves, Fragments sur l'histoire et la littérature de la République de Raguse et sur la langue slave, (in Croatian, Fragmenti o političkoj i književnoj povijesti stare Dubrovačke republike i o slavenskom jeziku). In 1838, he translated Ivan Gundulić's Osman into French and became the author of the earliest piano sonatas. He died in Paris. His collection also contains abundant information relevant to the two composers' life and work (Luka i Antun Sorkočević). Antun wrote four symphonies and numerous pieces for chamber music. ==Work== *Fragments sur l'histoire politique et littéraire de l'ancienne république de Raguse et sur la langue slave.

A bridle path, also bridleway, equestrian trail, horse riding path, ride, bridle road, or horse trail, is a path, trail or a thoroughfare that is used by people riding on horses. Trails originally created for use by horses often now serve a wider range of users, including equestrians, hikers, and cyclists. Such paths are either impassable for motorized vehicles, or vehicles are banned. The laws relating to allowable uses vary from country to country. In industrialized countries, bridle paths are now primarily used for recreation. However, they are still important transportation routes in other areas. For example, they are the main method of traveling to mountain villages in Lesotho.\\"Lesotho.\\" Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 24 June 2007 However, In England and Wales a bridle path now refers to a route which can be legally used by horse riders in addition to walkers, and since 1968, by cyclists. A \\"ride\\" is another term used for a bridleway: \\"a path or track, esp. one through a wood, usually made for riding on horseback\\" (Oxford English Dictionary). In the US, the term bridle path is used colloquially for trails or paths used primarily for people making day treks on horses, and usually used only on the East Coast, whereas out West the equivalent term is trail. The term bridleway is rarely used in the U.S. Most of the time horses are presumed allowed to use trails in America unless specifically banned, although rules differ among locations.Concord Monitor: \\"N.H. drops plans to limit horse use of state trails after complaints\\" In some countries long-distance multi-use trails have been created, including the Bicentennial National Trail in Australia, one of the longest marked multi-use trails in the world, stretching 5,330 kilometres.Bicentennial National Trail Retrieved 29-11-2013. Rail trails can often be used by equestrians. == In the United Kingdom == Cyclists on a bridleway in England ===England and Wales=== In England and Wales a bridleway is \\"a way over which the public has a right of way on foot and a right of way on horseback or leading a horse, with or without a right to drive animals along the way.\\"s 329, Highways Act 1980 and s 192, Road Traffic Act 1988A Dictionary of Law Enforcement. Oxford University Press, 2007 Although Section 30 of the Countryside Act 1968 permits the riding of bicycles on public bridleways, the act says that it \\"shall not create any obligation to facilitate the use of the bridleway by cyclists\\". Thus the right to cycle exists even though it may be difficult to exercise on occasion, especially in winter. Cyclists using a bridleway are obliged to give way to other users on foot or horseback pursuant to the Countryside Act 1968. In London's Hyde Park the sand-covered avenue of Rotten Row is maintained as a bridleway and forms part of Hyde Park's South Ride. It is convenient for the Household Cavalry, stabled nearby at Hyde Park Barracks in Knightsbridge, to exercise their horses. Although bridleways are described on Ordnance Survey maps, only the definitive map of the area (controlled by the county council) lists every legal bridle path. Long-distance bridle trails A number of long-distance multi-use trails have been created in England, including three National Trails, the Pennine Bridleway, , The Ridgeway, , and South Downs Way, . The British Horse Society has promoted long-distance routes for horse riders known as bridleroutes, incorporating bridleways, byways and minor roads.Ride-UK: National Bridle Route Network provides details of other long- distance bridle routes at http://www.ride-uk.org.uk . ===Scotland=== The Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 specifically establishes a right to be on land for recreational, educational and certain other purposes and a right to cross land. Access rights apply to any non-motorised activities, including horse- riding but only if they are exercised responsibly, as specified in the Scottish Outdoor Access Code. However, there is a lack of legally asserted public rights of way in Scotland, particularly for horse riding and cycling. Rights of way in Scotland mostly provide access for walkers, and only rarely for horse riders.Shared use paths and tracks - Scottish Natural Heritage ==U.S.== Sign for Old Bridle Path trail in New Hampshire, U.S. - which no longer allows horses. The United States has few if any formal designations for bridle paths, though horses are generally allowed on most state and federal trails, roads and public routes except where specifically restricted. Often, horses under saddle are subject to the same regulations as pedestrians or hikers where those requirements differ from those for cyclists. In most states, horses are classified as livestock and thus restricted from areas such as the right of way of the interstate highway system, though generally permitted to travel along the side of other roadways, especially in rural areas. Urban bridle paths exist in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park (most notably Forbidden Drive along the Wissahickon Creek) and New York City's Central Park Some trails managed by the U. S. Forest Service and other governmental entities may restrict access of horses, or restrict access during certain times of the year. For example, horses are allowed on the American Discovery Trail, which crosses the country, but only on specific sections of the Appalachian Trail. Access to trails and pathways on private land is generally left to the discretion of the landowner, subject to the general trespass laws of each of the 50 states. ==Rail trails== East Gippsland Rail Trail signage in Victoria, Australia indicating the shared trail usage Rail trails/paths are shared-use paths that make use of abandoned railway corridors. They can be used for walking, cycling, and often horse riding as well. The following description comes from Australia, but is applicable equally to other rail trails that exist throughout the world. ::\\"Following the route of the railways, they cut through hills, under roads, over embankments and across gullies and creeks. Apart from being great places to walk, cycle or horse ride, rail trails are linear conservation corridors protecting native plants and animals.

Abietinae is a valid botanic name for a series of Banksia. First published by Carl Meissner in 1856, the name has had three circumscriptions. ==According to Meissner== B. ser. Abietinae was first published in 1856, in Carl Meissner's chapter on the Proteaceae in A. P. de Candolle's Prodromus systematis naturalis regni vegetabilis. It was one of four series into which the subgenus Eubanksia was divided. These four series were defined in terms of leaf characters, with series Abietinae containing the species with entire or shortly denticulate leaves with revolute margins. In hindsight, it was the most homogeneous of the four series, as it contained only (but not all) species with hooked styles. The other three series were highly heterogeneous in comparison. The placement and circumscription of B. ser. Abietinae in Meissner's arrangement may be summarised as follows: :Banksia ::B. sect. Eubanksia :::B. ser. Abietinæ ::::B. pulchella ::::B. Meisneri ::::B. sphærocarpa :::::B. sphaerocarpa var. glabrescens (now B. incana) ::::B. pinifolia (now B. leptophylla) ::::B. nutans ::::B. ericifolia ::::B. spinulosa ::::B. tricuspis :::B. ser. Salicinæ (23 species, 8 varieties) :::B. ser. Quercinæ (18 species, 2 varieties) :::B. ser. Dryandroideæ (8 species) ::B. sect. Isostylis (1 species) Meissner's arrangement was current until 1870, when George Bentham published his arrangement, discarding all four of Meissner's series. ==According to George== In 1981, Alex George published a thorough revision of Banksia in his classic monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). He reinstated B. ser. Abietinae, placing it within B. sect. Oncostylis, and defining it as containing only those species with entire, linear leaves with revolute margins, and having roughly spherical inflorescences. Thus three species with elongate cylindrical inflorescences were moved into separate series. The placement and circumscription of B. ser. Abietinae in George's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia may be summarised as follows: :Banksia ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. sect. Banksia (9 series, 50 species, 9 subspecies, 3 varieties) :::B. sect. Coccinea (1 species) :::B. sect. Oncostylis ::::B. ser. Spicigerae (7 species, 2 subspecies, 4 varieties) ::::B. ser. Tricuspidae (1 species) ::::B. ser. Dryandroideae (1 species) ::::B. ser.

Isostylis (3 species) ==According to Thiele and Ladiges== In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges undertook a cladistic analysis of morphological characters of Banksia, which yielded a phylogeny somewhat at odds with George's taxonomic arrangement. Their cladogram included a clade consisting of the members of B. ser. Abietinae sensu George, and also B. tricuspis (Lesueur Banksia): Thiele and Ladiges therefore retained George's B. ser. Abietinae largely intact, but transferred Banksia tricuspis (Lesueur Banksia) back into it. They then further divided it into four subseries, in accordance with the resolution of clades in their analysis. The placement and circumscription of B. ser. Abietinae in Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement may be summarised as follows: :Banksia ::B. subg. Isostylis (3 species) ::B. elegans (incertae sedis) ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. ser. Tetragonae (4 species) :::B. ser. Lindleyanae (1 species) :::B. ser. Banksia (2 subseries, 12 species) :::B. baueri (incertae sedis) :::B. lullfitzii (incertae sedis) :::B. attenuata (incertae sedis) :::B. ashbyi (incertae sedis) :::B. coccinea (incertae sedis) :::B. ser.

Salicinae (2 subseries, 11 species, 4 subspecies) :::B. ser. Spicigerae (3 subseries, 7 species, 6 varieties) :::B. ser. Quercinae (2 species) :::B. ser. Dryandroideae (1 species) :::Banksia ser.

Longistyles :::::B. violacea :::::B. laricina :::::B. incana :::::B. tricuspis :::::B. pulchella :::::B. meisneri ::::::B. m. var. meisneri ::::::B. m. var. ascendens Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement remained current only until 1999, when George's treatment of the genus for the Flora of Australia series of monographs was published. This was essentially a revision of George's 1981 arrangement, which took into account some of Thiele and Ladiges' data, but rejected their overall arrangement. With respect to B. ser. Abietinae, George's 1999 arrangement differed from his 1981 arrangement only in the ordering of the species. ==Recent developments== Since 1998, Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is very greatly different from George's taxonomic arrangement, including finding Banksia to be paraphyletic with respect to Dryandra. Early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksia by transferring Dryandra into it, and publishing B. subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons. Abietinae all fall within Mast and Thiele's B. subg. Spathulatae, and for the most part fall close together. However B. nutans (Nodding Banksia) appears to be rather less closely related to the other species in series Abietinae than are Banksia dryandroides (Dryandra-leaved Banksia) and the members of B. ser. Grandes. Mast and Thiele have foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra is complete. ==References * ser.

The structure of the folding transition state is hard to find using methods like protein NMR or X-ray crystallography because folding transitions states are mobile and partly unstructured by definition. In \\\\phi -value analysis, the folding kinetics and conformational folding stability of the wild-type protein are compared with those of point mutants to find phi values. These measure the mutant residue's energetic contribution to the folding transition state, which reveals the degree of native structure around the mutated residue in the transition state, by accounting for the relative free energies of the unfolded state, the folded state, and the transition state for the wild-type and mutant proteins. The protein's residues are mutated one by one to identify residue clusters that are well-ordered in the folded transition state. These residues' interactions can be checked by double-mutant-cycle \\\\phi analysis, in which the single-site mutants' effects are compared to the double mutants'. Most mutations are conservative and replace the original residue with a smaller one (cavity-creating mutations) like alanine, though tyrosine-to-phenylalanine, isoleucine-to-valine and threonine-to-serine mutants can be used too. Chymotrypsin inhibitor, SH3 domains, individual domains of proteins L and G, ubiquitin, and barnase have all been studied by \\\\phi analysis. ==Mathematical approach== thumbright250pxEnergy diagrams for \\\\phi = 0 (left) or 1 (right). D is the energy of the denatured state, dagger, that of the transition state, and N, that of the native state. Phi is defined thus:Daggett V, Fersht AR. (2000). Transition states in protein folding. In Mechanisms of Protein Folding 2nd ed, editor RH Pain. Oxford University Press. \\\\phi = \\\\frac{(\\\\Delta G^{TS-D}_{W} - \\\\Delta G^{TS-D}_{M})}{(\\\\Delta G^{N-D}_{W} - \\\\Delta G^{N-D}_{M})} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta\\\\Delta G^{TS-D}}{\\\\Delta\\\\Delta G^{N-D}} \\\\Delta G^{TS-D}_{W} is the difference in energy between the wild-type protein's transition and denatured state, \\\\Delta G^{TS-D}_{M} is the same energy difference but for the mutant protein, and the \\\\Delta G^{N-D} bits are the differences in energy between the native and denatured state. The phi value is interpreted as how much the mutation destabilizes the transition state versus the folded state. Though \\\\phi may have been meant to range from zero to one, negative values can appear. A value of zero suggests the mutation doesn't affect the structure of the folding pathway's rate-limiting transition state, and a value of one suggests the mutation destabilizes the transition state as much as the folded state; values near zero suggest the area around the mutation is relatively unfolded or unstructured in the transition state, and values near one suggest the transition state's local structure near the mutation site is similar to the native state's. Conservative substitutions on the protein's surface often give phi values near one. When \\\\phi is well between zero and one, it is less informative as it doesn't tell us which is the case: # The transition state itself is partly structured; or # There are two protein populations of near-equal numbers, one kind which is mostly- unfolded and the other which is mostly-folded. ==Key assumptions== # Phi value analysis assumes Hammond's postulate, which states that energy and chemical structure are correlated. Though the relationship between the folding intermediate and native state's structures may correlate that between their energies when the energy landscape has a well-defined, deep global minimum, free energy destabilizations may not give useful structural information when the energy landscape is flatter or has many local minima. # Phi value analysis assumes the folding pathway isn't significantly altered, though the folding energies may be. As nonconservative mutations may not bear this out, conservative substitutions, though they may give smaller energetic destabilizations which are harder to detect, are preferred. # Restricting \\\\phi to numbers greater than zero is the same as assuming the mutation increases the stability and lowers the energy of neither the native nor the transition state. It is in the same line assumed that interactions that stabilize a folding transition state are like those of the native structure, though some protein folding studies found that stabilizing non-native interactions in a transition state facilitates folding. ==Example: barnase== Alan Fersht pioneered phi value analysis in his study of the small bacterial protein barnase. Using molecular dynamics simulations, he found that the transition state between folding and unfolding looks like the native state and is the same no matter the reaction direction. Phi varied with the mutation location as some regions gave values near zero and others near one. The distribution of \\\\phi values throughout the protein's sequence agreed with all of the simulated transition state but one helix which folded semi- independently and made native-like contacts with the rest of the protein only once the transition state had formed fully. Such variation in the folding rate in one protein makes it hard to interpret \\\\phi values as the transition state structure must otherwise be compared to folding-unfolding simulations which are computationally expensive. ==Variants== Other 'kinetic perturbation' techniques for studying the folding transition state have appeared recently. Best known is the psi (\\\\psi) value which is found by engineering two metal- binding amino acid residues like histidine into a protein and then recording the folding kinetics as a function of metal ion concentration, though Fersht thought this approach difficult. A 'cross-linking' variant of the \\\\phi-value was used to study segment association in a folding transition state as covalent crosslinks like disulfide bonds were introduced. == Limitations == The error in equilibrium stability and aqueous (un)folding rate measurements may be large when values of \\\\phi for solutions with denaturants must be extrapolated to aqueous solutions that are nearly pure or the stability difference between the native and mutant protein is 'low', or less than 7 kJ/mol. This may cause \\\\phi to fall beyond the zero-one range. Calculated values \\\\phi depend strongly on how many data point are available and lab conditions. ==See also== * Chevron plot * Denaturation midpoint * Equilibrium unfolding ==References== Category:Protein structure Category:Protein folding Category:Protein engineering Category:Protein methods ","title":"Phi value analysis"},{"id":"6238122","text":"Betton Hills is a neighborhood near Tallahassee, Florida.

He was drafted by the Montreal Canadiens in the second round, 27th overall, of the 1986 NHL Entry Draft. ==Playing career== After playing three seasons for the Hull Olympiques of the QMJHL, Brunet made his professional debut with the American Hockey League's Sherbrooke Canadiens in the 1988–89 season. He also made his NHL debut with Montreal that same season, appearing in two games and recording one assist. Brunet became a fixture on the Canadiens' roster, playing with them until the 2001–02 season. He became a favorite of the hometown fans due to his local roots and path to the NHL as well as his work as a defensive forward which made him a constant on the team's penalty killing unit. During the 2001–02 season, he was traded to the Dallas Stars, along with Martin Ručinský, in exchange for Donald Audette and Shaun Van Allen. Brunet appeared in 32 games with the Stars before being traded again, this time to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for a pick in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. Brunet finished the season with Ottawa, and retired afterward. In his NHL career, Brunet appeared in 539 games. He scored 101 goals and added 161 assists. He also appeared in 54 playoff games, scoring five goals and adding 20 assists. He was a member of the Canadiens team that won the Stanley Cup in 1993. ==Colour commentator== A few years after his retirement, Brunet was hired as a colour commentator for the French-language sports network RDS for NHL games that did not involve the Montreal Canadiens. For the 2008-09 season he was promoted as the main colour commentator alongside play-by-play man Pierre Houde for all Montreal Canadiens games, replacing longtime veteran Yvon Pedneault. ==Career statistics== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

Because they settled in territory claimed by Native Americans, they had no recourse to the Pennsylvania colonial government. Accordingly they established what was known as the Fair Play System, with three elected commissioners who ruled on land claims and other issues for the group. In a remarkable coincidence, the Fair Play Men made their own declaration of independence from Britain on July 4, 1776 beneath the \\"Tiadaghton Elm\\" on the banks of Pine Creek. ==The 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix== The British colonial government purchased land from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1768, opening new lands in Pennsylvania and New York for settlement, including what is now Lycoming County, Pennsylvania. Lycoming County is about 100 mi (160 km) northwest of Philadelphia and about 165 mi (265 km) east-northeast of Pittsburgh. Map of the West Branch Susquehanna River (dark blue) and Major Streams in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania. Pine Creek (red) and Lycoming Creek (yellow) were each claimed to be \\"Tiadaghton Creek\\", the disputed boundary between Native American and colonial lands. However, some of the treaty's Line of Property (or Purchase Line) border along the West Branch Susquehanna River was disputed. Part of the western border which divided colonial and Native American lands north of the river was defined by \\"Tiadaghton Creek\\". The colonists claimed this was Pine Creek (further west, giving them more land), the Iroquois and other tribes claimed it was Lycoming Creek (further east). The colonial government recognized the tribal claim and so all land west of Lycoming Creek was considered Native American and off bounds for settlement. Despite this, illegal settlers settled in the disputed area along the West Branch Susquehanna River, the west bank of Lycoming Creek, Larrys Creek, and especially at the mouth of Pine Creek. ==The Fair Play system== The settlers elected three commissioners each March who were responsible that everyone was dealt with fairly (hence the name \\"fair play\\"). Most of their rulings seem to have dealt with property issues, but they dealt with any legal or criminal cases in the Fair Play area. They granted permission for new settlers to enter the area, could take away a settler's land claim if they were absent more than six weeks (except for military service), and could expel a person (by setting them adrift in a canoe on the river). The commissioners' decisions were final and supposedly were never challenged. In 1776 the three commissioners of the Fair Play Men were Bratton Caldwell, John Walker, and James Brandon. They are the only commissioners whose names are now known and it is conjectured that they were the only three for the duration of the Fair Play system. ==The Pine Creek Declaration of Independence== The American Revolutionary War started in April 1775. Men from the area volunteered to serve in the Continental Army that year. Most of the settlers in the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were for the revolution. On July 4, 1776, the Fair Play Men met on the west bank of Pine Creek near the mouth of the West Branch Susquehanna River and declared their Independence from Britain. The traditional site for the declaration was beneath the \\"Tiadaghton Elm\\" tree, which stood until the 1970s in what is now Clinton County, Pennsylvania. This was west of Pine Creek in what was clearly Native American land. Afterwards the Fair Play Men met in their own Fort Horn (near the elm tree) and chose to send two men with the news to Philadelphia, not knowing that the Second Continental Congress had declared independence there the same day. The two messengers, Patrick Gilfillen and Michael Quigley Jr., were ambushed and robbed by Native Americans and later jailed by Loyalists, but escaped and made it to Philadelphia on July 10. They returned a short time later to bring word of the United States Declaration of Independence. ==The Big Runaway== Map of fortifications and streams in north-central Pennsylvania during the Big Runaway. The Fair Play Men had two small forts: Fort Horn (at the mouth of Pine Creek) and Fort Reid (at the mouth of Bald Eagle Creek). In the American Revolutionary War, settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. In the early summer of 1778 news came of a group of Native American warriors, perhaps accompanied by Loyalist and British soldiers, heading for the West Branch Susquehanna River valley to destroy settlements. There were many smaller incidents of violence against settlers, but on June 10, 1778 a party of sixteen settlers were attacked in what is now Williamsport. In what became known as the \\"Plum Tree Massacre\\", twelve of the sixteen were killed and scalped, including two women and six children. The Wyoming Valley Massacre occurred on July 3, 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre). This news caused the local authorities to order the evacuation of the whole West Branch valley. At least two riders braved attacks to warn their fellow settlers. Rachel Silverthorn volunteered (when no man would) to leave the relative safety of Fort Muncy (in Muncy Township). She rode along Muncy Creek and the Wyalusing Path and warned settlers, who fled to the safety of Fort Muncy. Her own family's cabin was later burnt to the ground. Robert Covenhoven, who had served under George Washington in the Continental Army, rode west along the ridge of Bald Eagle Mountain to warn settlers at Fort Antes (opposite what is now Jersey Shore) and the western part of the valley. Covenhoven is listed as a Fair Play Man and one of the signers of the Tiadaghton Declaration of Independence. Most settlers had already gathered at five small forts for safety, but now the forts and the settlers' homes and fields were abandoned, with livestock driven along and a few possessions floated on rafts on the river east to what is now Muncy, then further south to Fort Augusta at what is now Sunbury. The abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers reported fleeing at night with the glow of their burning settlements lighting the sky behind them. Fort Horn and the other Fair Play Men settlements were all destroyed. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee a second time in the summer of 1779 in the \\"Little Runaway\\", when another force of Native Americans and British soldiers attacked the valley again. Also in 1779, Sullivan's Expedition destroyed at least forty Native American villages in New York and helped reduce attacks to stabilize the area and encourage resettlement. ==After the war== Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission marker at the site of the Tiadaghton Elm in 2006; the elm died in the 1970s. The Fair Play Men and their system continued after the end of the war. In 1784, a second Treaty at Fort Stanwix ceded the Native American lands to the new government of the United States (and recognized Pine Creek as \\"Tiadaghton Creek\\"). When the land office opened in May 1785, the Fair Play men were no longer illegal settlers and their existing land claims were recognized. ==Legacy== There are no original written records from the Fair Play Men or their Declaration of Independence, although many later accounts exist. The two main theories that have been advanced to explain this are: first that any records were destroyed in the Great Runaway (only one house survived in the whole West Branch valley); or second that they kept no records to avoid incriminating themselves as they were illegal settlers. The riders to Philadelphia are supposed to have lost their copy of the Declaration of Independence when ambushed or later when jailed. In the absence of primary written records, some modern historians have doubted whether the actual Tiadaghton Declaration of Independence took place on July 4, 1776, or whether it was made before knowledge of the United States Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia reached the Fair Play Men. The closest borough to the \\"Tiadaghton Elm\\" site is Jersey Shore in Lycoming County, which has a week-long Town Meeting each year over the Fourth of July. The Town Meeting includes a procession of people dressed as the Fair Play Men and a Tiadaghton Elm ceremony. ==References== Category:People from Clinton County, Pennsylvania Category:Pre-statehood history of Pennsylvania Category:People from Lycoming County, Pennsylvania ","title":"Fair Play Men"},{"id":"6238212","text":"{  align=\\"right\\" style=\\"margin-left:10px\\" width=\\"320\\" - bgcolor=#e7dcc3 align=center colspan=3Rectified 24-cell - bgcolor=#ffffff align=center colspan=3280px Schlegel diagram 8 of 24 cuboctahedral cells shown - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Type colspan=2Uniform 4-polytope - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Schläfli symbols colspan=2r{3,4,3} = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{l}3\\\\\\\\\\\\4,3\\\\end{array}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} rr{3,3,4}=r\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{l}3\\\\\\\\\\\\3,4\\\\end{array}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} r{31,1,1} = r\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{l}3\\\\\\\\\\\\3\\\\\\\\\\\\3\\\\end{array}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Coxeter diagrams colspan=2 or - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Cells 48 24 3.4.3.4 20px 24 4.4.4 20px - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Faces 240 96 {3} 144 {4} - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Edges colspan=2288 - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Vertices colspan=296 - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Vertex figure colspan=250px50px50px Triangular prism - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Symmetry groups colspan=2F4 [3,4,3], order 1152 B4 [3,3,4], order 384 D4 [31,1,1], order 192 - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Properties colspan=2convex, edge- transitive - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Uniform index colspan=222 23 24 } Net In geometry, the rectified 24-cell or rectified icositetrachoron is a uniform 4-dimensional polytope (or uniform 4-polytope), which is bounded by 48 cells: 24 cubes, and 24 cuboctahedra. It can be obtained by rectification of the 24-cell, reducing its octahedral cells to cubes and cuboctahedra. E. L. Elte identified it in 1912 as a semiregular polytope, labeling it as tC24. It can also be considered a cantellated 16-cell with the lower symmetries B4 = [3,3,4]. B4 would lead to a bicoloring of the cuboctahedral cells into 8 and 16 each. It is also called a runcicantellated demitesseract in a D4 symmetry, giving 3 colors of cells, 8 for each. == Construction == The rectified 24-cell can be derived from the 24-cell by the process of rectification: the 24-cell is truncated at the midpoints. The vertices become cubes, while the octahedra become cuboctahedra. == Cartesian coordinates == A rectified 24-cell having an edge length of has vertices given by all permutations and sign permutations of the following Cartesian coordinates: : (0,1,1,2) [4!/2!×23 = 96 vertices] The dual configuration with edge length 2 has all coordinate and sign permutations of: : (0,2,2,2) [4×23 = 32 vertices] : (1,1,1,3) [4×24 = 64 vertices] == Images == {  width=360 !Stereographic projection - colspan=2 align=center360px - Center of stereographic projection with 96 triangular faces blue } == Symmetry constructions == There are three different symmetry constructions of this polytope. The lowest {D}_4 construction can be doubled into {C}_4 by adding a mirror that maps the bifurcating nodes onto each other. {D}_4 can be mapped up to {F}_4 symmetry by adding two mirror that map all three end nodes together. The vertex figure is a triangular prism, containing two cubes and three cuboctahedra. The three symmetries can be seen with 3 colored cuboctahedra in the lowest {D}_4 construction, and two colors (1:2 ratio) in {C}_4, and all identical cuboctahedra in {F}_4. { class='' !Coxeter group !{F}_4 = [3,4,3] !{C}_4 = [4,3,3] !{D}_4 = [3,31,1] - align=center !Order 1152 384 192 - align=center !Full symmetry group [3,4,3] [4,3,3] <[3,31,1]> = [4,3,3] [3[31,1,1 = [3,4,3] - align=center !Coxeter diagram    - !Facets 3: 2: 2,2: 2: 1,1,1: 2: - align=center !Vertex figure 80px 80px 80px } ==Alternate names== * Rectified 24-cell, Cantellated 16-cell (Norman Johnson) * Rectified icositetrachoron (Acronym rico) (George Olshevsky, Jonathan Bowers) ** Cantellated hexadecachoron * Disicositetrachoron * Amboicositetrachoron (Neil Sloane & John Horton Conway) == Related polytopes == The convex hull of the rectified 24-cell and its dual (assuming that they are congruent) is a nonuniform polychoron composed of 192 cells: 48 cubes, 144 square antiprisms, and 192 vertices.

Planet Rock is the second planet to join the Interplanetary Alliance. ===Graveheart=== At the beginning of the series, Graveheart is a simple miner working for Lord Mantel. However, when discovering Tekla and being ambushed by Beast Drones on Planet Ice during routine exporting, Graveheart realizes he must step into the leader seat and bring the worlds together to stop a common enemy. He is a very noble, brave man, though he often suffers from lack of self-confidence, deeming himself as \\"just a miner and nothing more\\". When put into battle, he immediately takes charge and commands his troops with authority and skill. Those around him respect him to the fullest. Formerly a Quarrior (a portmanteau of warrior and quarry, he quit Planet Rock's military when he failed to save his younger brother, Mica, during a raid on Planet Fire. He often has his doubts about himself, but Jade is always there to reassure him of his abilities. Graveheart was exiled from Planet Rock when he formed the Alliance, leaving himself and Jade as the only two citizens of Rock in the group. Notably, he wears a black version of the standard Miner's armor. What this means is never revealed, but he calls the Miners \\"his men\\". He also called \\"sir\\" by the other miners, implying he is of a higher rank, most likely a miner foreman. He is voiced by Paul Dobson. His name and design is a reference to the movie, “Braveheart”. ===Jade=== Tough and uncompromising, Jade is Captain of the Guard of Planet Rock and Graveheart's best friend. She loves Graveheart very much, though she is unwilling to admit it. While working with the Alliance, her loyalties lie with Planet Rock first and foremost. Lord Mantel was very reluctant to exile Jade as she had asked, but agreed to it for her to be able to watch over the Alliance. Jade rarely shows her feelings, but what she has shown is a great dislike for Emperor Femur. After Lord Mantel's death at Blokk's hands, Jade underwent a psychological test and became ruler of Planet Rock. She is voiced by Enuka Okuma. ===Lord Mantel=== The ruler of Planet Rock, a harsh and merciless man. He is unwavering in his beliefs that Planet Rock is superior to all other planets. This forces him to refuse Rock's participation in the Alliance. He is stubborn and arrogant, but quite well liked on the planet. In exchange for lending the Battle Moons to the Alliance, he has Jade collect information on it and eventually got its command codes. With Graveheart gone on the Prison Planet, Mantle uses the Battle Moons to attack the Beast Planet to prove Rock is superior, leaving the planet defenseless. He is eventually killed by Blokk after the Beast Planet invades his planet. His funeral is later made but his deception is kept a secret otherwise it would demoralize the Alliance. He is voiced by Blu Mankuma. ===Commander Feldspar=== The commander of Planet Rock's military and guardian to the entrance of Lord Mantel's fortress. He commands Planet Rock's Battle-Moons; he also takes over Jade's duties after she is exiled. He doesn't believe in or trust the Alliance. After the Beast Planet's invasion, he is brutally killed by Blokk. He is voiced by Alec Willows. ==Planet Ice== Planet Ice is made up mostly of ice, which is stolen to be used for water. The people of Plant Ice take the appearance of blue insectoid's. Planet Ice is the first planet to become part of the Interplanetary Alliance. ===King Cryos=== The wise and admirable king of Planet Ice, Cryos is admired by all of his people for his intelligence. Although he seems quiet at a glance, he is very thoughtful and the brains behind the Alliance. He is also one of the founding members, as he is one of the first to realize the threat that the Beast Planet is able to cause. He truly believes that peace between all of the worlds can be established, but that everyone must work hard for it. Because of their similar beliefs, Cryos and Graveheart become very close friends throughout the series. Cryos is also constantly worrying over his daughter, Zera's, safety. Regardless, he never hesitates to engage the minions of the Beast Planet in battle, and is a very capable tactician and a valuable asset to the Alliance. He is voiced by Mark Oliver. ===Lady Zera=== The curious and childish daughter of King Cryos, Lady Zera is a dreamer and wishes she could go on adventures like her father. Often, she'll stow away on her father's vehicles, but he always finds her. She can act quite arrogant at times, but she is actually quite caring and sweet. Jade eventually teaches her how to battle so she can be safe while her father is on Alliance missions and Zera, like her father, is a skilled sharpshooter. She also builds a very close friendship with the prince of Planet Fire, Pyrus. She is voiced by Tegan Moss. ===Commander Medstar=== Besides the royal family, he is the highest-ranking member of Planet Ice. He was made king temporarily when Cryos stepped down, he then gives the throne back to Cryos just before the fight against Remora. He is voiced by Garry Chalk ==Planet Fire== Planet Fire is known for it fire energy, and is mostly made up of volcanoes and lava pools. The people of Planet Fire are humanoid with different body types, what is common between all of them is that they have fire on the top of their heads. Planet Fire is the third plant to join the Interplanetary Alliance. ===Prince Pyrus=== The young and naive prince of Planet Fire, Pyrus took on the responsibility of ruling his world at a very young age. His father died when he was quite little, and ever since then, Pyrus was raised by the Vizier. He is a very kind, compassionate individual, but he can revert to a childish mood when set off. He's very quick-tempered, and tends to do things without thinking them through. Regardless, he is always putting the people of his planet first, which makes for a great leader. When first approached about the Alliance, Pyrus enthusiastically joined, and was quick to realize the threat of the Beast Planet. Pyrus gets along very well with mostly everyone from the Alliance, particularly Zera and Femur; he is the only member of the Alliance who trusts Femur, initially refusing to believe that Femur was retreating from the Remora battle. He is voiced by Matt Hill. ===The Grand Vizier=== Prince Pyrus' royal counselor and surrogate father, the Vizier is a rough, untrusting old man. He is a firm believer in old tradition and the way things were in the past, and is very loyal and protective of his prince. He eventually sacrifices his life in hopes of destroying the Beast Planet, but before he dies, he witnesses Graveheart save Pyrus' life, and realizes the Alliance will give Pyrus a new home. The Beast soon recreates him and Planet Fire, so as to lure its inhabitants to be fed to it. However, it made a few flaws in the faux Vizer, such as his former mistrust of the Alliance. When Pyrus realized the truth, he allowed the faux Vizer to fall into an ocean of null energy, destroying the planet. The Vizier has several similarities to Captain Ahab from Moby Dick and his last words \\"For my planet's sake, I spit my last breath at thee\\". are almost the same as Ahab's final words before his own death. He is voiced by Jim Byrnes. ===Captain Blaze=== The captain of the Igneous Knights and of Pyrus's personal guard he is loyal in equal amounts to the heart of fire and to his prince. He is seen several times and at one stage he commands a battle moon to attack the beast planet so as to \\"go out in a blaze of glory\\", he also takes the bone emperor Femur along with him. However, when the prince is attacked by beast drones when attempting to follow him and bring him back Blaze realises that he cannot let his prince die and returns just in time to save the day. He is voiced by Michael Dobson ==Planet Bone== Planet Bone is known for is earth and rich soil and is mostly made up of swamps. A common thing to do on bone is to kill the current emperor and take over. Most of the people on Planet Bone are reptilian. Planet Bone is the fourth and final planet to join the Interplanetary Alliance. ===Emperor Femur=== The Emperor of Planet Bone, Femur is a short, fat, obnoxious reptilian creature who is constantly scheming of new ways to benefit himself. He is a very crafty, vile man with self-gratification as the only thing on his mind. Despite being self-indulgent, Femur cares for his planet and does indeed think of the citizens of Bone, and he willingly and paternally looks after the last surviving plant from Planet Jungle. Not a fighter by any means, Femur instead chooses to hide in the midst of battle, and in the crucial battle of Remora he led his troops in a retreat when things got rough. He is also very flirtatious with the ladies, particularly Jade (much to her disdain). He genuinely cares for Pyrus and serves as a surrogate uncle-type figure, trying to keep him out of battles and being upset at the thought of being assassinated without patching things up with Pyrus. He is voiced by Garry Chalk. ===Pelvus=== Femur's royal servant, the flamboyant Pelvus is just as vile as his emperor. He is always plotting Femur's demise, as according to a popular rhyme on Bone, \\"Ya snag the throne, ya rule on Bone/He who dies is food for the flies\\" . Femur always escapes every death trap Pelvus sets for him. Quite incompetent, Pelvus is also a coward, something he and Femur have in common. However, Pelvus keeps a wide array of weaponry on him at all times. He is voiced by Scott McNeil. ===Sternum=== Femur's brother and the former emperor of Bone. Rather than risk his brother making an attempt on his life and being the next in line for the throne, Sternum ordered Femur to be executed. Femur then bribed the guards to release him, and had Pelvus drug Sternum, thus securing the throne in typical Bone fashion. But instead of killing his brother, Femur had Sternum shipped off to the Prison Planet. He became quite a hero on the Prison Planet, leading a group of escaped prisoners; he showed a noble air and formed a quick relationship with Jade. When he returns to Planet Bone, he appears to reconcile with his brother and becomes once again emperor of Bone. In the Prison Planet, Sternum was tortured, and when, Femur says, \\"Hey, you're still alive. It couldn't have been that bad\\". Sternum thinks that Femur obviously does not understand how bad it was. Sternum obviously would rather die than to go through the endless torture again, and almost kills Femur for his misunderstanding. When he returns to the Cluster after sacrificing the Prison Planet to teleport the Beast Planet away, Sternum asks Pelvus on information of the Alliance, implying that he intends to take over. Pelvus relays this to Femur but the Emperor believes that his brother has changed, and brushes off the notion. Sternum appears less reptilian and more human than other Bone characters. As he was designed to look muscular and human, his tendrils under his mouth are so short that it looks like he has a chin with three clefts. He is voiced by John Payne. ==Planet Tek== Planet Tek only appears in a few scenes at the beginning of the series and in flashbacks. Based on Tekla's appearance, the people of the planet would’ve been made of metal, or chrome, making them look robotic. ===Tekla=== The sole survivor and princess of Planet Tek, she was found by Graveheart and Cryos, who vowed to help her in any way they could. After slipping into a coma, she was possessed by Lamprey, who used her body to try and destroy the Alliance. Regaining herself, Tekla became a valuable member of the Alliance thanks to her broad knowledge. Though she is not a very powerful fighter, she can hold her own in battle. She is voiced by Donna Yamamoto. ===Voxx=== Tekla's mechanical sphere that floats around her and fills her in on the surroundings and any other information she may need to know. It is always at her side, and learns anything it can possible in the process. In \\"Night on the town\\" Tekla describes Voxx as an \\"Action Computer\\" when Jade refers to it as a toy. This is likely an in-joke, as Voxx's shape and size are identical to Planet Tek from the original War Planets toy line. ==The Beast Planet== The Beast Planet is the main antagonist of the show, using its ability to create Beast Drones, they and the beast general's, crush the defenses of a planet so that The Beast Plant can, eat it. ===Blokk=== One of the Beast Generals sent to conquer any planets they could get their hands on, Blokk was a firm believer in the brute force method. He gets carried away quite easily, and is definitely not as intelligent as Lamprey - if he had his way, he would launch an all-out assault on the Alliance and wipe them out with his Beast Drones. Despite this, Blokk is one of the Beast's most formidable warriors, being armed with a pair of jagged claws on each forearm. He also lacks the frailty of his drone subordinates, having no obvious weak points to destroy. After their failure in the first season, Blokk and Lamprey returned to the Beast Planet and were tortured and beaten. However, at the end of the series, he invades the underdefended Planet Rock, killing Lord Mantel and several inhabitants before challenging Graveheart to a final battle in the planet's World Engine. Blokk meets his end at Graveheart's hands when a forcefield generator is shoved into his body, disintegrating him from within. Blokk had a habit of \\"jittering\\" his skull during the first season, but stopped when Lamprey told him that it annoyed her. Late during season two he regained his \\"jitter\\" whenever he became angered. He is voiced by Scott McNeil. ===Lamprey=== One of the Beast Generals sent to conquer any planets they could get their hands on, Lamprey is much more level-headed than Blokk, often bickering with him on the best way to proceed. She favored more subtle tactics than Blokk, using manipulation to create inner turmoil amongst the Alliance. In combat, Lamprey can use the tendrils on her arms as whips or blades. Her main plan was to possess Tekla and turn the Alliance members against each other. The plan failed, but Lamprey continued to taunt the group, until the destruction of Remora sent her and Blokk back to the Beast Planet for punishment. In Lamprey's last appearance in the series, she makes another attempt on Tekla's life, but is instead engaged in combat with Jade. She accidentally crushes herself underneath a collapsing ceiling in the melee, killing her, though after the fight, no sign of Lamprey remains underneath the rubble. Her fate is left uncertain. She is voiced by Tasha Simms. ===Voyd=== One of the Beast Generals sent to conquer any planets they could get their hands on. Voyd outranks Blokk and Lamprey, and thus acts as the deciding vote on which of their plans to carry out. Additionally, he is able to act as an interdimensional transport, teleporting Blokk and Lamprey to safety when able to. Being significantly larger than Blokk and Lamprey, Voyd is assumed to be much more powerful than both of them, and is the one being besides the Beast Planet they both fear. He is a mysterious being that never speaks, and appears primarily in the first season. He later appears on a monitor within Blokk's fighter during the second season. Voyd does not have a \\"jaw\\" (unlike Blokk and Lamprey), which may be the reason why he never talks. He, however, still make grunts similar to that of Beast Drones. The fact that Lamprey is female, Blokk is male and Voyd is of indeterminate gender may be seen as significant in their positions and in the way they prefer to work. ===Beast Drones=== The mindless infantry of the Beast Planet's forces, consisting of null matter condensed around a crescent-shaped containment unit. They can be killed instantly by destroying their containment units, but make up for it through sheer numbers and deadly null-matter blasters on their left arms. ==Planet SandZuma=== A peaceful inhabitant of Planet Sand, Zuma is native and unfamiliar to the other worlds. She knows only what she learned, and has very powerful telepathic abilities. She joins the Alliance as a representative of her planet. However, she finds it difficult to be separated from her \\"kindred\\". She is voiced by Ellen Kennedy. ===Ramset=== The apparent leader of the Sun people, a small humanoid who moves about in an imposing suit of gold armor. He thought that the Sand people were unable to communicate until Zuma first \\"spoke\\" to him. He is voiced by Grahame Andrews ==Prison PlanetJewelia=== Like Sternum, Jewelia is a leader of the escaped prisoners of the Prison Planet. She is manipulative, yet charming, and is very accustomed to getting her way. Her name is pronounced \\"Julia\\". She becomes a thorn in the Alliance's side. However, unlike Sternum and most of the other inhabitants of the Prison Planet, she doesn't want to leave; she wants to take over the planet and rule it. Although not explicitly stated, it can be assumed that she is a member of Planet rock, based on her name and physiology. Whereas other characters have some sort of clothes/armor (with the exception of Tekla), Jewelia appears to have neither. Her heels appear as though a part of her body, rather than shoes. She is voiced by Janyse Jaud. ==See also== * War Planets * Shadow Raiders * Trendmasters makers of War Planets * Mainframe Entertainment producers of Shadow Raiders Shadow Raiders ","title":"List of Shadow Raiders characters"},{"id":"6238253","text":"Rene Corona (born August 17, 1984) is an American soccer player who currently plays for Hollywood United Hitmen in the USL Premier Development League. ==CareerCollege=== Corona attended Centennial High School and played college soccer at Santa Ana College, where he was named to the NSCAA Division III Men's Soccer All-Far West Region team as a sophomore in 2005, and helped lead his team to the CCCS Division III national title in 2004, appearing in 23 matches and scoring 7 goals. ===Professional=== After playing for the amateur Corona Crew in the Coast Soccer League Corona joined the squad of Chivas USA in 2006, and played extensively in the MLS Reserve Division, but featured in just one MLS match before being waived at the end of 2007.

St. Mary’s School was founded in 1865 as a boarding and day school to serve pioneering families throughout southern Oregon and northern California. Today, it provides a college preparatory curriculum for students in grades 5-12. The 24-acre campus is located in east Medford. According to Niche, St. Mary's School is the most highly ranked Catholic High School in Oregon, the 2nd most highly ranked boarding school in Oregon, and the 3rd most highly ranked private school in Oregon. ==History == St. Mary's School was founded in the mining town of Jacksonville, Oregon, in 1865 by three members of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary and was known as St. Mary's Academy. Operating as a twelve-year (the upper grades were limited to girls) boarding and day school serving families in Southern Oregon and Northern California. St. Mary's graduated its first student in 1871. St. Mary's moved to Medford, Oregon in 1908. In the late 1920s, the school became coeducational, graduating its first male student in 1930. In 1948, the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary transferred the title of the school to the Sacred Heart Parish, which operated it as a twelve-year coeducational school for the next 13 years. In 1961 St. Mary's Elementary and High School separated into two schools when the current high school was built on Black Oak Drive. In 1971, when the Sacred Heart Parish determined it could no longer financially support two schools, a group of supporters raised funds and gained permission from the Archbishop to incorporate as an independent, Catholic school, the first in Oregon. With the Archbishop's permission St. Mary's added a middle school in 1987 after a fire damaged the Sacred Heart School and representatives of the parish and greater community asked the Board of Trustees to transfer the seventh and eighth grades to the school. A sixth grade was added in 1992. In 1998, St. Mary's began its first capital expansion in 31 years with a five-phase building campaign. Since 1998, St. Mary's completed an expanded parking facility, an all-weather eight-lane track and upgraded athletic fields and a library/media and science center with three science labs and seven additional classrooms. ==Accreditation== St. Mary's School is registered with the Oregon Department of Education and is accredited by the Northwest Accreditation Commission and the Pacific Northwest Association of Independent Schools.

The school offers 24 Advanced Placement courses, including four foreign languages: Latin, German, Spanish, and Mandarin. Sophomores and Eighth Graders complete the International Schools' Assessment, which offers schools a form of international benchmarking. In August 2008, St. Mary's received a Confucius Classroom grant from the Confucius Institute, providing funds for community members to learn Mandarin and study the Chinese culture free of charge. St. Mary's was the first school in the United States to become part of the Confucius Institute. St. Mary’s has a diverse range of students from different cultures, including international students from China, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Belgium, England, and Indonesia. == Athletics == St. Mary's is a member of the Oregon School Activities Association and participates in the Southern Cascade League.

The company manages twenty unique summer educational programs, including programs in Government and Leadership, Law, CSI, Medicine, Mass Media, Gaming and Technology, Engineering, National Security, Business Innovation, and Early STEM Exploration. Many of Envision's programs are held at university and college campuses. In addition, the company has collaborated with several national universities, including Stanford University for its Advanced Emergency Medicine and Intensive Law & Trial programs, Rice University for the Rice University Aerospace & Aviation Academy, and George Mason University for its Game & Technology Academy. The company is based in Vienna, Virginia and offers programs in a number of cities across the United States, as well as selected cities in China, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. In 2012, Envision EMI merged with LeadAmerica and rebranded itself as Envision Experience. The company's current officers are Duncan Young, CEO, Don Neff, CFO, Andrew Potter, CAO, and Lauren Freyfield, CMO In the past, critics have accused the company of recruiting students by claiming that attendance is selective when the company actually markets its programs to tens of thousands of youth. In 2009, when Envision was still under the direction of Richard Rossi, the company's co-founder and the current President and Executive Director of the National Leadership Academies, the company attracted over 15,000 youth to events related to President Barack Obama's inauguration but was unable to fulfill the promises it made in its promotional materials. It settled a lawsuit, promising to pay out up to $17 million in vouchers to event attendees. Envision's programs have been accredited by the International Association for Continuing Education and Training (IACET), the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, and the Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement (SACS CASI) an accrediting division of AdvancED. == History  Founding and Purpose === The company was originally founded as the Congressional Youth Leadership Council (CYLC) in 1985 by Barbara Harris and Richard Rossi. Prior to founding CYLC, Harris worked as both a classroom teacher and as a school administrator, and Rossi worked as a congressional staffer. The two met when Harris arranged a trip for her students to attend the second Presidential Inauguration of Ronald Reagan. The stated purpose of the company was to \\"create unique experiences that create a lifetime advantage to high-achievers.\\" , neither Harris nor Rossi were affiliated with the company. === Early History === After seven years of exclusively operating as the Congressional Youth Leadership Council (CYLC), Harris and Rossi incorporated the National Youth Leadership Forum with the goal of helping prepare high school students for college and career success. The first such forum, held in 1992, was the National Youth Leadership Forum (NYLF) on National Security. CYLC and NYLF both worked with National Capital Resources for curriculum development and delivery.  Growth of NYLF and CYLC  In 1993, NYLF added the forum on Medicine. Two years later, they would add the forum on Law & CSI. In 1998, National Capital Resources was renamed as Envision EMI, and one year later, CYLC held its first international program, the Global Young Leaders Conference (GYLC). By 2003, CYLC and NYLF had added the International Scholar Laureate Program for college-aged students and the Junior National Young Leaders Conference (JrNYLC) for middle school students. As of 2006, the combined companies had over 200 staff members and annual revenues of over US$75 million, with over 47,000 students from fourth grade through college attended Envision programs around the world. In 2007, Envision EMI acquired the assets of the Congressional Youth Leadership Conference and the National Youth Leadership Forum. According to the 2008 IRS filing for one of its subsidiary programs, the Congressional Youth Leadership Council, \\"all full-time staff working on the account of CYLC are employees of Envision EMI LLC.\\" Envision EMI formerly operated some of its programs on behalf of non- profit entities that it had an exclusive marketing relationship with, including the Congressional Youth Leadership Council and the National Youth Leadership Forum, which Envision purchased in November 2007. Envision acquired the assets of the Congressional Youth Leadership Council, including its name and the rights to run all of the programs. By 2009, the company was hosting more than 56,000 students in 273 conferences in the United States, China, and Australia focusing on career education and qualities of leadership. The week- long programs ranged from $1,440 to more than $3,060. Students were encouraged to raise money to help fund the trip. The programs are marketed as conferences that help scholars develop their leadership and educational skills. The company strives through its marketing efforts to reach students it describes as high-achievers. ===Recent History=== In October 2011, substantially all the assets of Envision EMI, LLC were acquired by Leadership Platform Acquisition Corporation (LPAC), an newly formed affiliate of Gryphon Investors, which describes itself as \\"a highly respected San Francisco based private equity firm with a strong commitment to the field of education.\\" In June 2012, the company hired John B. Richards, the former head of Starbucks' North American operations with a marketing background in the hospitality industry, as its new CEO. In August 2012, the company merged with LeadAmerica, a company that offered similar services. In August, 2013, the company rebranded itself as Envision Experience. ==Programs Worldwide== As of the summer of 2018, the company offered 17 different career, leadership, and technology programs at 35 different locations across the United States and world, including programs in China, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand. Envision offers career exploration programs in the following fields: Medicine, Law, Engineering, Business, National Security, and Game Design. The company also offers high school and middle school leadership programs, as well as early STEM exploration for middle and elementary school students. Additionally, every four years, coinciding with the U.S. presidential inauguration, the conducts a Presidential Inauguration Leadership Summit. Prior to the 2017 Summit, the company partnered with Discovery Education in a program through which high school students interviewed and reported on candidates for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Previously, in 2009, Envision EMI hosted more than 56,000 students in 273 conferences, more students than attended the programs of the company's three closest competitors combined, and it planned to offer 310 conferences in 2010. Most of the programs were attended by 150 to 400 students. == Programs by Grade Level == Envision programs are offered students as young as third grade and as old as rising college seniors, with middle and elementary school programs focusing on STEM exploration and leadership development and high school programs focusing more on career exploration. === Elementary School Programs ===  National Youth Leadership Forum: Pathways to STEM  A six-day program for students in grades 3 - 5 that introduces them STEM applications and leadership skills.

Previous Envision speakers include: * General Colin Powell * Malala Yousafzai * Abby Wambach * Spike Lee * Shawn Fanning * Guy Kawasaki == Student Selection == Students can be nominated or apply to participate in Envision's programshttps://www.envisionexperience.com/admissions. Teachers, guidance counselors, youth organization advisers, participating institutions, and alumni can nominate students. Students can also apply to attend the programs here \\"...during which you will write two short essays and provide the name of a mentor – teacher, guidance counselor, coach, etc. – who can speak to your achievements and maturity, and who may be contacted to offer supporting information for your application.” The company seeks attendees who have a 3.0 or higher GPA, demonstrated leadership potential through extracurricular activities, and provide two short, written essays on their career goals. It also accepts applications from students with lower GPAs if they provide a teacher recommendation attesting to the student's interest in the conference area and a statement that the student's GPA does not reflect their full potential. == Recognition == In 1999, 2003, and in November 2007, Envision EMI was cited in \\"Great Places to Work: Where to Launch a Career\\" by The Washingtonian Magazine. ==College credits== The faculty at George Mason University has approved several Envision programs for elective college credit in \\"Special Topics in Leadership.\\". These programs are the NYLF Forum on National Security, the National Young Leaders Conference, the National Youth Leadership Forum on Medicine, the National Youth Leadership Forum on Law and CSI, and the Global Young Leaders Conference. Participating students have the opportunity to earn one or two college credits, depending upon the length of the program, and credits are generally transferable to other 4-year colleges or universities. Students are evaluated for \\"active participation in simulations, contributions to discussions and demonstration of leadership and critical thinking skills in group and individual settings.\\" George Mason University notes that \\"it is unlikely that this type of credit will have a significant bearing on the college admissions process. When given the opportunity, we encourage students to think about how they can present these experiences in the application process as an example of their leadership potential.\\" Academic programs offering college credit help save on undergraduate tuition, in addition to allowing students to explore specialized career paths and interests while offering \\"invaluable opportunities to take advanced courses and make use of resources not available in most high schools\\". ==CriticismRecruitment practices=== The company markets its programs to what it describes as \\"high achievers\\" and \\"an elite group of outstanding young people\\" which it identifies via recommendations and mass mailings. In 2009, more than 287,000 teachers nominated students to participate in an Envision EMI program. Students are nominated to attend the National Youth Leadership Forum by \\"teachers and alumni of previous conferences, and it culls names from mailing lists, for which the Congressional Youth Leadership Council paid $263,000 in 2006.\\" In 2008, some program materials stated that a minimum 3.5 grade point average (GPA) was required. Educators who nominate students are now told to use their own discretion. Teachers who nominate students to attend the company's programs say they consider a student's grades, behavior and participation in class, interactions with other students, and ability to learn. The nomination form does not ask for GPA. levels or educational achievement, simply asking only for the student's name, address, school year and sex. Representation of exclusiveness; Portraying high selectivity  Many high school students believe that attending one of Envisions' conferences is an honor and that their participation will positively affect their chances for college admission. CollegeConfidential.com, written by professional college admission counselors, reports that \\"Too many students are invited to take part to make this a truly selective organization, and so many college candidates do take part—especially those from the more well-heeled families—that college- admission officials usually just yawn when they spot an Envision program on an application.\\" Among college students, Susan Garrity Ardizzoni, Director of Undergraduate Admissions at Tufts University, reported that some students who receive invitations are not what she would consider \\"leadership material.\\" Patrick O'Connor, the director of college counseling at the Roeper School for gifted students in Birmingham, Michigan, reported that he is \\"happy to nominate whoever wants to go.\\" ===2009 inaugural conference criticism and legal action=== In January 2009, Envision EMI was criticized for its handling of their Presidential Youth Inaugural Conferences that offered 15,000 youths the opportunity to attend exclusive events in Washington, D.C. Participants received a letter congratulating them on being \\"accepted to be among the thousands of students\\" to \\"witness first-hand the Inauguration of the 44th President of the United States. Some students who had attended prior Envision events were surprised by the number of participants. One alumni of prior Envision conferences said she did not expect to be among 5,000 university students and 10,000 middle school and high school students at the conference. Prior conferences she had attended had around 200 to 400 students. Envision did not tell participants the actual number of attendees until they arrived. A former employee of Envision, Angie Peltzer, returned as a faculty adviser during the Presidential Youth Inaugural Conferences and said she believed the company was unprepared to handle the number of students. \\"It's hard to do 15,000 people when you've only done 500 before,\\" Peltzer said. Another student attendee said the invitation gave her the impression \\"that there would be less people and it would be more intimate.\\" She was surprised by the numbers who attended. The program web site stated that the conference included \\"exclusive and private inaugural events and activities... as well as public ceremonial events, such as the official swearing-in ceremony and the inaugural parade.\\" Parents began to file complaints with the company. As a result, the company pledged an independent review headed by Benjamin R. Civiletti, the Carter administration attorney general, and set aside US$1 million for restitution. The company acknowledged there were issues: \\"While the vast majority of scholars who attended our presidential inaugural programs had a positive experience, we acknowledge that some of them have stated that they did not and this is unacceptable to us.... We are urgently working to address each and every concern and to respond to the families' inquiries as quickly as possible.\\" Lawsuit filed On May 13, 2009, the law firms Hausfeld LLP and DiMuroGinsberg PC filed a class action lawsuit, Radosti v. Envision EMI, LLC. The plaintiffs filed suit against Envision and CYLC citing breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and violations of state consumer protection laws. According to the lawsuit, delegates were told they would attend a \\"Black Tie Gala\\", when the actual dress code was \\"professional business attire (suits)\\". The suit alleges, that \\"instead of the promised official inaugural ball, the students were taken to a \\"glorified prom\\".\\" Richard Rossi, a co-founder of Envision, told The New York Times in April 2009 that the logistical challenges during the inauguration were overwhelming. \\"We were operating in almost a war zone, literally a presidential state of emergency\\", Mr. Rossi said. \\"There were a lot of things going on that were inconveniencing even V.I.P.'s.\\" Settlement announced On June 10, 2010, the law firm announced a settlement that provided up to US$17 million in tuition vouchers to members of the class action suit. The vouchers provide anyone who attended any of the inaugural programs with two, fully transferable vouchers worth US$625 (totaling US$1,250). The voucher can be redeemed until 2018 in payment as tuition for any future Envision program. Class members may only transfer the vouchers to individuals who meet Envision's academic qualifications, including a demonstrated grade point average of 3.5 or higher. The judge who approved the settlement noted that the cy pres fund established by the settlement agreement—if properly administered—will ensure that Envision substantially disgorges the profits from its alleged misconduct. The vouchers are worth approximately 50% of the tuition cost for the Presidential Inaugural conference. To provide a marketplace for the transferable vouchers, Envision agreed to maintain a web page describing how the vouchers can be transferred and redeemed. If Envision fails to distribute vouchers totaling at least US$8,000,000, it agreed to establish a Class Settlement Scholarship Fund that may be used to provide partial or total scholarships to \\"academically qualified applicants.\\" The Fund may also distribute an additional 5% of scholarships to other youth organizations to give to their members so they may attend Envision programs. , the voucher web site page was no longer available. Settlement criticism In an amicus curiae brief filed with the United States Supreme Court, Theodore H. Frank of the public-interest law firm Center for Class Action Fairness stated that there is a likelihood that \\"class members will not be able to use their coupons to attend the conference of their choice, given that only 10% of seats at any given conference will be allowed to redeem coupons.\\" He noted that the court approved the settlement over the objection of 22 state attorneys general. He also wrote that class members are forced to help Envision EMI stay in business and are compelled to deal with the same firm that failed to deliver the initial conference for which they paid more than $2,300 to attend. ==References * Envision EMI Category:Youth organizations based in Virginia Category:Class action lawsuits Category:Educational organizations based in the United States Category:Companies based in Vienna, Virginia Category:1985 establishments in Virginia ","title":"Envision EMI"},{"id":"6238357","text":"Credit to owner, Toronto PCC streetcar 4602 and Haagsche Tramweg-Maatschappij (HTM) 1329 at the National Capital Trolley Museum. The National Capital Trolley Museum (NCTM) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that operates historic street cars, trolleys and trams for the public on a regular schedule. It is located at 1313 Bonifant Road, Colesville, Maryland USA. The museum's primary mission is to preserve and interpret the history of the electric street and interurban railways of the National Capital region. ==Hours of operation== The Museum is open every Saturday and Sunday from Noon until 5:00 p.m. except for Christmas and Christmas Eve; and New Years and New Year's Eve. It is also open to the public on Thursdays and Fridays from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. during the following calendar dates: 15 March until 15 May, 15 June until 15 August, and 1 October until 15 November. ==History== NCTM was incorporated on January 4, 1961, as the National Capital Historical Museum of Transportation, Inc. Progress was slow at first, but the Museum eventually combined efforts and streetcar collections with a group from Baltimore. The organization found its first home in Lake Roland Park in Baltimore, Maryland.\\"8 Old Street Cars Go Today To Start Lee Park Exhibit\\". The Baltimore Sun. May 1, 1962. p. 42. After efforts were thwarted by adjacent property owners, the group divided the collections in 1966. National Capital Trolley Museum moved to its present site in Colesville, Maryland, while the Baltimore Streetcar Museum was formed to focus on Baltimore transit. The site was provided by Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, and DC Transit leased trolleys for a nominal cost.Watson, Douglas. \\"Trolley Buffs Start Barn-Museum Today\\". The Washington Post. November 20, 1965. p. B2. The organization raised $20,000 to build a car barn.\\"Street Car Museum Near Completion\\". The Washington Post. March 20, 1966. p. L5. Groundbreaking of the Colesville site began on November 20, 1965. NCTM's original intention was to operate streetcars owned by DC Transit president O. Roy Chalk, but it was not until 1970 that Chalk donated several historic Washington streetcars. In the interim, the museum acquired a small fleet of European trams and a car from Johnstown, Pennsylvania. NCTM ran its first streetcar in October 1969, and since then the museum has operated consistently over its one-mile line. In the winter of 2008–2009, the Museum moved into three new buildings: a Visitors Center, a display building for the streetcars (Street Car Hall), and a streetcar storage and maintenance building. Construction of the Intercounty Connector, (ICC) which crosses the Museum's former location, required the Museum to shift locations in the Park. The Museum reopened on Saturday, January 16, 2010. ==Education efforts== The Museum offers a variety of education programs and activities throughout the year. On Thursdays and Fridays each spring and fall, the Museum hosts school field trips by advance reservation. Special summer programs are offered on Thursday and Friday from June 15 to August 15 with age-appropriate activities. ==Membership and funding== , 125 members and friends support the Museum with dues, donations and volunteer service. The Museum receives most of its money from admission fees and revenues from its gift shop. Other funding for a variety of projects is provided by the Arts and Humanities Council of Montgomery County, the Montgomery County Heritage Tourism Alliance, the Montgomery County Historic Preservation Commission, and the Maryland Historical Trust. The State of Maryland, Montgomery County, and private donors provided capital funding support for the current relocation. ==Collection== At one point or another, NCTM has owned an example of nearly every type of Washington streetcar to be preserved. These include: * DC Transit 0522 and 0509*, pre-1900 wooden street cars * Washington Railway and Electric Company 650, a 1912 center door car * Capital Transit 766, a 1918 deck-roof standard car (under restoration as Capital Traction Company 27) * Capital Transit 1053*, the only complete preserved pre-PCC streamliner * DC Transit 1101, Washington's first PCC street car * Capital Transit 07*, 09, and 026*, wooden snow sweepers * Capital Transit 1430, a PCC car built during World War II * Capital Transit 1470, a PCC car built in 1945 (acquired in July 2020 from the Virginia Museum of Transportation) * Capital Transit 1540, a PCC car built in 1945 The asterisk (*) indicates cars lost in the 2003 carbarn fire. NCTM holds the largest collection of surviving Washington, D.C. street cars in the world, in addition to an archives library of Washington street car and Maryland interurban railroad records, journals, and miscellaneous artifacts. The NCTM collection has also included streetcars from Berlin, Düsseldorf, Graz, The Hague, Toronto, Vienna, New York City, Philadelphia, Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Brussels and Trams in Blackpool.

The Demonstration Railway is the largest and most popular exhibit of the Museum. The line goes past Street Car Hall and the Maintenance Barn and down into the woods past Dodge siding, along Northwest Branch, and on to Fish Hook loop to turn around for the return trip. ===Street Cars Go to the Movies=== Harold Lloyd’s silent films are excerpted and displayed continuously in a small theater. Exhibits on the walls leading into the theater link the importance of movies and street cars to community life in the early part of the 20th century. ===Street Car Communities & Rock Creek Railway Co.=== This exhibit highlights street car transportation in the local communities and includes a working model of the street car line through Chevy Chase, one of the first street car suburbs in the country. This exhibit includes images of the power house at the end of the line, a worker emerging from a plow pit where each street car traveling between downtown and the suburbs is converted from collecting underground power with a plow to an overhead trolley pole. Visitors can use the controller handle to start the street car and can operate a dynamo to generate electricity for the lights in the buildings along the track. ===Conduit Hall=== An actual piece of track and the steel framework for the underground electrical conduit is on display in Conduit Hall along with a model of a conduit switch. Conduit Hall also includes overhead \\"trolleys\\" (the electricity collecting device that makes contact with the overhead wire) and a hands-on controller from the early 20th century. ===Street Car Hall=== Adjacent to Conduit Hall and the Visitor Center is Street Car Hall. At any one time seven or more street cars are on display in this spacious building. Near the cars are illuminated kiosks with information about the street cars in the collection and their history. The display includes the oldest street car in the collection, DC Transit 0522 built in 1898. At the end of each street car trip, a docent will take passengers into Street Car Hall and discuss the history of street car development and answer questions. ==Accidents and fires== In 1970, its unique air-conditioned PCC car 1512, the \\"Silver Sightseer,\\" was damaged by arsonists and scrapped. In 1987, cars 1053 and 766 were severely damaged in a collision. One of the worst disasters to ever befall a North American trolley museum occurred at NCTM on September 28, 2003, when one of the two carbarns at the museum's former site burned down. Eight pieces of equipment, comprising about half of the museum's operating fleet and one-third of its total collection of street cars, were destroyed. Washington cars lost included 0509, 1053, 07, and 026. Johnstown 352, Graz 120, and Vienna 6062 and 7802 were also destroyed. The cause of the fire was not definitely determined, though the fire inspector did conclude that it was an accidental fire and not a case of arson. Some of the cars lost, such as 1053 and 07, were the only preserved examples of their designs, while others have examples preserved elsewhere. Immediately following the fire, the museum resumed operations with the remaining cars. Since the fire, the museum has purchased streetcars from, or traded with, other museums to replace those lost. ==References== * * ==External links== *National Capital Trolley Museum Category:Colesville, Maryland Category:Railroad museums in Maryland Category:Heritage railroads in Maryland Category:Museums in Montgomery County, Maryland Category:Street railway museums in the United States Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"National Capital Trolley Museum"},{"id":"6238362","text":"Sardar Muhammad Chaudhry (1937–2004) practised law briefly and then joined the Police Service of Pakistan in 1963.

Soigne ta droite is a phrase from boxing - a trainer's call to \\"keep your right up\\". The immediate reference is to Jacques Tati's first short film, Soigne ton gauche (Keep Your Left Up). But this is neither a comedy in the classical sense, nor a film about boxing. Godard describes it as \\"the camera versus landscapes over 17 rounds\\". It may also be described as a film which does a two-way travel between sky and earth, between comic and experimental, between shadow and light. With humour and multiplying literary references and citations, Godard question himself on life and thus on death, within his kaleidoscope of images. This engaging film, which mixes genres, goes through the shadowy sky of the history of cinema a luminous way. ==Plot== Described by Godard as \\"a fantasy for actor, camera and tape recorder\\", this film is made up several sketches in which certain actors play several real or fictional roles to a background of rock music. The film is divided into three sections which inter-cross throughout. In each, a group of people search for their proper place on earth. In the first, a group of musicians search for the right sound, the ideal harmony. In the second, a man searches for an ideal society and wonders if he is on the wrong planet. In the third, some travellers search for their destination, as Ulysses did in the bygone days. Each group has its own project, but the story is really about projection (as in film projection) as the essence of man's adventure on earth. A very beautiful voice presents the film, leads it along, prepares for what follows and gives us the illusion of taking part in the art of creation. ==External links== * Category:French avant-garde and experimental films Category:1987 films Category:Films directed by Jean-Luc Godard Category:Gaumont Film Company films Category:French films Category:French- language films Category:Louis Delluc Prize winners Category:1980s avant-garde and experimental films ","title":"Keep Your Right Up"},{"id":"6238379","text":"Night Patrol is a 1984 American comedy film starring Linda Blair, Pat Paulsen, Andrew Dice Clay, Billy Barty, and Murray Langston. The actor Murray Langston, who portrayed Melvin White, acted as his real-life persona The Unknown Comic within the film. Linda Blair received a Razzie Award for Worst Actress in 1985. Reception of the film was generally negative. == Plot == Melvin White is an inept policeman who is demoted to night patrol by his pathologically lying captain, who has excessive flatulence. White's partner is Kent Lane, who has been a police officer for ten years and loves nothing more than having sex with women in the back of his police car. Fellow police officer Sue Perman is attracted to White, but White does not understand her hints and thinks of her as only a buddy. White and Lane get involved in various situations that include a couple parked in front of a fire hydrant, people smoking marijuana which they join in, and a male rape victim with a high-pitched voice. In between his duties as a police officer, White is the stand-up comedian The Unknown Comic at night. While in his persona, White wears a paper bag over his head that has holes for his eyes and mouth. White is popular as The Unknown Comic, and he has a chance to become even more famous and rich when a talent agent seeks him out. Edith Hutton, a fan of White, is attracted to The Unknown Comic and wants to discover who is under the paper bag. Hutton is even willing to leave her current boyfriend for him. White also has sessions with a psychiatrist. Things become more complicated for White when a thief begins to rob bars at gunpoint while disguised as The Unknown Comic. No one is aware of The Unknown Comic's identity, but his captain has a suspicion that it is White. To prove that he is innocent, while also trying to hide his stand-up comedian identity, White works with Lane to track down who is impersonating him. White is supposed to perform at a venue as The Unknown Comic, but he is unable to do so because he is on the trail of the thief as a police officer within that venue. An impersonator of the comedian shows up on stage to perform, while another impersonator enters the place to steal money. White and his partner chase the thief and lose sight of the person on stage. The two of them catch up to the thief, resulting in White and the thief having a Western- film-style gun draw duel. The victor of the duel is White, and an unmasking reveals the impersonator is his psychiatrist, who says he wanted to become rich in White's place. White then finds and confronts the second impersonator, who turns out to be Perman. Perman used a recording of White's voice to protect him from being arrested. The film then ends with Perman and White having sex at White's apartment. ==Production and release== The actor Murray Langston, who portrayed Melvin White, acted as his real-life The Unknown Comic persona within the film. It is the second film directed by Jackie Kong, who co-wrote the script with Murray Langston, William A. Levey and Bill Osco. Kong also edited the film. Andrew Dice Clay has a cameo appearance as a stand-up comedian named Tony Maroni. Pat Morita has a bit part in the film as a rape victim. The film was released in theaters by New World Pictures on November 16, 1984. It was released on DVD on July 22, 2004. ==Reception== Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote a positive review, stating, \\"Though the humor is strictly for the stag-party crowd, which isn't discriminating, the performances have a good, low-burlesque style to them\\". A review from TV Guide said in a negative review, \\"This police comedy does the impossible: It makes POLICE ACADEMY (1984) look like a piece of sophisticated humor\\". Richard Christiansen of the Chicago Tribune also gave a negative review: \\"Night Patrol appears to have been made by subnormal persons weaned on Blazing Saddles, Animal House and Police Academy\\".

As an amateur, Wright amassed a 90-12 record, including 4 straight Tacoma Golden Gloves titles, appearing in the finals of the 2001 u.s. amateur championships,http://amateur- boxing.strefa.pl/Nationalchamps/USA2001.pdf and the quarterfinals of the 2002 national Golden Gloveshttp://amateur- boxing.strefa.pl/Nationalchamps/USGoldenGloves2002.html and u.s. amateur championships,http://amateur-boxing.strefa.pl/Nationalchamps/USA2002.pdf which led to high expectations for him as a professional. He opened his pro career by losing in his boxing debut to Matt O'Brien by knockout, despite leading on all three cards. Wright then compiled a string of consecutive victories, becoming a regular fixture at the Battle at the Boat series at the Emerald Queen Casino in Washington, culminating in his appearance on the ESPN reality show \\"Contender Season 2\\", a welterweight tournament. Wright was chosen to be on the \\"Gold Team\\" for the show. He fought Andre Eason in the first round of the tourney, scoring a knockdown in the 1st round, and winning the fight 50-44 on all three judges' cards. He lost his quarterfinal bout to Cornelius Bundrage by unanimous decision; in a post-fight interview, Wright indicated that he'd decided to try and out-punch Bundrage, rather than out-box him. On September 26, 2006, Wright faced off against fellow Contender teammate Vinroy Barrett, winning by technical knockout in the 4th round of the 6 round bout. On the January 12, 2007 edition of ESPN's Friday Night Fights at the Emerald Queen Casino in Tacoma, Washington, Wright squared off against undefeated but untested Dan Wallace, defeating Wallace by TKO in the eighth and final round. Wright's next fight came on the Contender's USA vs. UK. challenge at the Metro Radio Arena in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Wright faced undefeated Anthony Small at light middleweight. Wright came close to knocking Small out in the eighth round, but ran out of gas before he was able to do so. Wright lost by split decision ~ 75-77  74-78  77-76 ~. 3 years later, on June 19, 2010, Wright returned to the Emerald Queen Casino claiming he had never been away from the sport despite not competing, and won a unanimous decision in a 6-round super middleweight bout over Joshua Snyder. Wright went on another sabbatical from competition for almost 3 years before filling in as a last minute replacement for Joey Spina on March 15, 2013 against Contender Season 1 finalist and former challenger for WBO super middleweight and WBC middleweight titles, Peter Manfredo Jr at the Twin River Casino Event Center in Rhode Island, and losing an over the limit super middleweight 10 rounder. Before taking the fight on short notice against Manfredo, Wright had served as sparring partner for James Kirkland and had signed to fight Omar Henry just before Henry's diagnosis with cancer, passing only months later. ==Professional boxing record== { style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\\" - ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes - 23 Loss 17–6 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Andreas Katzourakis UD 6 2019-04-26 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\" - 22 Loss 17–5 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Mark DeLuca UD 10 2018-10-20 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - 21 Win 17–4 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Mark DeLuca SD 12 2018-06-23 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - 20 Win 16–4 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Eduardo Torres  5 (6), 2018-03-17 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - 19 Win 15–4 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Rafael Valencia UD 6 2018-01-12 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - 18 Loss 14–4 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Peter Manfredo Jr. UD 10 2013-03-15 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\" - 17 Win 14–3 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Joshua Snyder UD 6 2010-06-19 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - 16 Loss 13–3 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Anthony Small  8 2007-03-30 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - 15 Win 13–2 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Dan Wallace TKO 8 (8), 2007-01-12 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - 14 Win 12–2 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Vinroy Barrett TKO 4 (6), 2006-09-26 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - 13 Loss 11–2 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Cornelius Bundrage UD 5 2006-02-03 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - 12 Win 11–1 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Andre Eason UD 5 2006-01-23 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - 11 Win 10–1 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Kemal Kolenovic TKO 8 (10), 2005-10-22 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - 10 Win 9–1 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Daniel Neal UD 6 2005-09-17 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - 9 Win 8–1 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Calvin Odom UD 10 2005-07-30 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - 8 Win 7–1 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Jerome Elder TKO 2 (6), 2005-06-25 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\" - 7 Win 6–1 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Darnell Boone UD 8 2005-05-24 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - 6 Win 5–1 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Walter Gilliam KO 1 (4), 2005-05-14 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - 5 Win 4–1 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Ray Craig TKO 3 (4), 2005-02-25 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - 4 Win 3–1 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Marcus Hicks UD 4 2004-05-15 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - 3 Win 2–1 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Mike Hannah  1 (4), 2004-04-03 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\" - 2 Win 1–1 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Jose Medina  4 2003-11-14 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - 1 Loss 0–1 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Matt O'Brien  3 (4), 2003-05-31 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" } ==References== *Allen, Percy.
