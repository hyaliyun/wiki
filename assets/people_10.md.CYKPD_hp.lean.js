He was killed at the age of 18 on the day of Ashura, in the Battle of Karbala’. According to Jean Calmard writing in Iranica, ‘Ali al-Akbar's reputation as a valiant warrior of the Household of Muhammad might have preceded that of Al-‘Abbas ibn ‘Ali. == Biography == Ali al-Akbar was Husayn's son who was 18 years old at the battle of Karbala. Two of his brothers were also named Ali al-Asghar ibn Husayn and Ali Zayn al-Abidin. The teenager resembled his maternal grandfather Muhammad, the prophet of Allah, so much that Husayn ibn Ali often said, \\"whenever I happen to miss my maternal grandfather I look at the face of Ali al-Akbar.\\" Ali al-Akbar was killed by Murrah ibn Munqad on 10 Muharram 61 AH in battle of Karbala. == Martyrdom in the Battle of Karbala == As an Iranica said, Ali al-Akbar was the first of the person who was killed in battle-field. He had a loud and beautiful voice, on the morning of the day of Ashura, Husayn ibn Ali asked Ali Akbar as to call out the Adhan. Husayn ibn Ali and many women in their tents began to weep when Ali Akbar began calling out the Adhan, suspecting that it may be the last time they heard Ali Akbar give the Adhan. Ali Akbar stood in front of Husayn ibn Ali after Zuhr prayers and said: \\"Father I request for permission to go and fight the enemies of Islam.\\" His father gave him permission and said, \\"May Allah be with you! But Akbar, you know how much your mother, sisters, and aunts love you. Go and say farewell to them.\\" Ali Akbar went into the tent of his mother, Umme Layla. Every time he wanted to come out of the tent his mother, aunts, and sisters would pull his cloak and say, \\"O Akbar, How will we live without you?\\" Husayn ibn Ali had to plead with all to let Ali Akbar go. Husayn ibn Ali helped his son mount his horse. As Akbar began to ride towards the battlefield he heard footsteps behind him. He looked back and saw his father. He said: \\"Father, we have said good-bye. Why are you walking behind me?\\" Husayn ibn Ali replied, \\"My son if you had a son like yourself then you would have surely understood!\\" According to Bal'ami, Ali Akbar stroke the enemies ten times and killed two or three of them each time. Umar ibn Sa'ad ordered his soldiers to kill him, saying, \\"When he dies, Husayn will not want to live! Ali Akbar is the life of Husayn.\\" While a few soldiers attacked Ali Akbar, Murrah ibn Munqad threw a spear through Ali Akbar's chest. Murrah ibn Munqad then broke the wooden part of the spear and left the blade inside Ali Akbar's chest, to cause him more pain. As Ali Akbar fell from his horse, he said, \\"Yaa bata alayka Minni salaam\\" upon hearing his son's call, it is said that Imam Hussain lost his eyesight. When Imam Hussain arrived close to him and tried to remove the spear from his chest, the spear's head had been tangled in his veins and when Imam Hussain pulled it out, his heart came out alongside it. He was then surrounded and was cut to pieces. He walked towards the battlefield. When he went to Akbar, Akbar placed his right hand on his wounded chest and his left arm over the shoulder of his father. Al-Husayn asked, \\"Akbar, why do you embrace me with only one arm?\\" Akbar did not reply. Al-Husayn tried to move Akbar's right hand, but Akbar resisted. Then Al-Husayn forcefully moved the hand and saw the blade of the spear. He laid Akbar on the ground and sat on his knees, placing both of his hands on the blade of the spear. He looked at Najaf, where his father was buried, and said, \\"Father, I too have come to my Khaybar!\\" He pulled out the blade, with it came to the heart of Akbar. Al-Husayn, distraught seeing his son in such pain and stress, wept. Akbar sent his last Salam and martyred. == See also == * Muhammad the Islamic Nabi (, Prophet) * ‘Ali ibn Abu Talib * Battle of Karbala’ * Sakinah(Fatema Kubra) bint Husayn * Sakina bint Hussain == References == Category:7th-century Arabs Category:Family of Muhammad Category:People killed at the Battle of Karbala Category:664 births Category:680 deaths ","title":"Ali al-Akbar ibn Husayn"},{"id":"2233282","text":" The Republic XP-69 was an American fighter aircraft proposed by Republic Aviation in 1941 in response to a requirement by the United States Army Air Corps for a high-speed fighter. Manufacturers were encouraged to consider unorthodox designs; although the design was ordered as a prototype it was canceled because of delays with the engine that was to power it. == Development == The United States Army Air Corps began the R40-C fighter competition in February 1940. The competition encouraged manufacturers to propose unorthodox high-speed fighter aircraft that met the requirements of Type Specification XC-622. The specification called for a single-engined high- performance fighter aircraft, with a maximum speed between , armed with both machine guns and cannons, and be capable of landing on a long grass runway. Republic was one of six companies selected for the competition, and one of the aircraft proposed to the USAAC by Republic was the AP-12 Rocket. As proposed, the AP-12 was to be powered by a 2,500 hp Wright R-2160-3 Tornado 42-cylinder liquid-cooled radial engine mounted in the mid-section of the aircraft's streamlined, cigar-shaped fuselage, behind the cockpit, which drove a pair of three-bladed contra-rotating propellers. It was to be armed with four nose- mounted machine guns firing through the propeller arc, and a single 20 mm cannon firing through the propeller hub. The AP-12 placed 13th out of 26 contestants, forcing Republic to go back to the drawing board to improve its proposal. In July 1941, Republic submitted an improved design, the AP-18. The AP-18 had little in common with the AP-12. It retained the original aircraft's R-2160 engine, which was now mounted in the nose of a completely new small- cross section airframe. The large radiator was to be mounted under the fuselage. The pressurized cockpit was to feature a bubble canopy, and an armament of four .50 in machine guns and two 37 mm cannons mounted in a laminar flow wing was planned. XP-69 mockup In December 1941, the United States Army Air Forces (successor to the USAAC) ordered two prototypes of the AP-18 under the designation XP-69. A mockup was built and was inspected by the USAAF in June 1942. Construction of the first prototype began in November of that year. However, due to development troubles and delays with the R-2160 engine, the XP-69 project was canceled in favor of a parallel development, the Republic XP-72, on May 24, 1943. By that time engineering on the project was 75% complete and the prototype was still in the early stages of construction, with the total program cost being $810,000. == Specifications (XP-69 as planned) == == See also == == References == Category:Republic aircraft Category:1940s United States fighter aircraft Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Aircraft with contra-rotating propellers Category:Low-wing aircraft ","title":"Republic XP-69"},{"id":"2233285","text":"North Carolina Highway 132 (NC 132) is a North Carolina state highway entirely in New Hanover County. It travels from US 421 north of Carolina Beach through Wilmington to US 117/NC 133 just south of the main business district of Castle Hayne. The road runs just to the east of downtown Wilmington, and runs along the western edge of the University of North Carolina Wilmington. NC 132 was established in 1958 running along its present-day routing from US 421 to US 117 in Castle Hayne. In 1983 the road was shifted along the present day routing of I-40 from Wilmington to US 117 south of Wallace. However, in 1984, NC 132 was reverted to its pre-1983 designation, with the freeway being renumbered as I-40. ==Route description== NC 132 begins at US 421 on the border of Myrtle Grove and Silver Lake. The road begins to follow the four- lane College Road to the north, with businesses on the western side of the road and multiple neighborhoods along the eastern side. After an intersection with Greenbrier Road, College Road runs through a primarily residential area of Wilmington. While there are many neighborhoods branching off of the road, multiple apartment complexes become apparent, primarily on the western side of the highway. Nearing 17th Street, College road passes by Cape Fear Academy, an unaffiliated private school. At the 17th Street intersection, several businesses appear on the side of the road including a CVS Pharmacy, Zaxby's and Walgreens. After passing Bragg Drive, the surrounding area reverts to primarily residential. NC 132 provides access to Pine Valley Country Club to the west. After passing by Holly Tree Road, College Road runs east of the Longleaf Shopping Center and John T. Hoggard High School. Immediately after passing the shopping center, NC 132 intersects Shipyard Boulevard (US 117). US 117 turns to the north to begin a concurrency with NC 132 which will last for the rest of its routing. Highway near the Shipyard intersection Leaving the Shipyard Boulevard intersection, the road passes to the west of Hugh MacRae Park and to the east of Roland-Grise Middle School. Through this section, the road widens from a four-lane to a six-lane divided road. The road also approaches Oleander Drive (US 76), leading it into a commercial area. After crossing over Oleander Drive, NC 132 and US 117 continue through a commercially active section of the city, with multiple shopping centers, restaurants and small stores along the route. After passing Hurst Drive, NC 132 runs along the western border of the University of North Carolina Wilmington, providing multiple accesses to the university. After crossing over Randall Parkway, NC 132 runs between the busy shopping centers of University Commons-Wilmington and University Centre. The road continues to see multiple stores after passing New Centre Drive. Just north of New Centre, College Road uses an interchange with US 17 Business, and begins to parallel MLK Parkway (US 74). Nearing an intersection with US 74, College Road passes just east of a Costco and passes to the west of a factory for Corning Inc. The road meets up with US 74 at a four-way intersection with Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway. Immediately following the intersection, College Road runs through a very residential section of northern Wilmington, providing access for multiple neighborhoods. After Kings Grant Road, the median of the highway widens to prepare for the beginning of I-40. NC 132/US 117 run a very brief concurrency with I-40 for about before both highway exit off at exit 420B. NC 132 merges onto a four-lane divided road, named College Road (the same as the rest of the highways routing). The road passes several small stores, however no shopping centers are present alongside the highway. As the highway leaves Wilmington, it passes by Emsley A. Laney High School. College Road provides several entrances to a large neighborhood to the west of the highway. College Road passes an industrial park situated between it and I-40. As the road progresses further north, it passes over I-140 and US 17, which leads the road from its suburban surroundings to more rural ones. Passing Cape Fear Community College, the road is lead in a heavily forested area, however as the road gets closer to Castle Hayne, more neighborhoods become apparent off the sides of the road. As NC 132 nears its northern terminus, it passes by a quarry and then makes a turn to head directly north. NC 132 ends at a roundabout with NC 133 just south of Castle Hayne. NC 133 and US 117 continue together to the north on a separate concurrency. ==History== NC 132 was created in 1958 as new routing running from US 421 south of Wilmington along College Road to US 117 in Castle Hayne. In 1983 NC 132 was rerouted along new freeway from the present day I-40 interchange to US 117 near Wallace. The routing NC 132 left behind into Castle Hayne became a secondary road. In August 1984, NC 132 was removed from the freeway routing, and reinstated on its previous routing along College Road to Castle Hayne. The freeway was subsequently renumbered as a part of Interstate 40. On March 17th, 2003, US 117 was removed from its routing south of Castle Hayne to downtown Wilmington. Instead it was routed along NC 132 south to Shipyard Boulevard. A roundabout replaced an at-grade Y-intersection at NC 132's northern terminus in August 2015. ==Major intersections== ==References== ==External links== *NCRoads.com: N.C. 132 132 Category:Transportation in New Hanover County, North Carolina ","title":"North Carolina Highway 132"},{"id":"2233301","text":"Saint Saviour (Jèrriais: St Saûveux/St Sauveur) is one of the twelve parishes of Jersey in the Channel Islands.

It is in the south east of the Island, and contains some of the suburbs of Saint Helier. It is the smallest parish by surface area, but the second most densely populated. St. Clement stretches west to east from Le Dicq to within a quarter mile of La Rocque harbour (at the end of Rue de la Lourderie). Its surface area is around . The parish is subdivided into three vingtaines, and is administered at local level by the Connétable. ==History== The round tower at Le Hocq is a prominent coastal landmark Much of the parish lies below equinoctial high-tide level and was frequently flooded before Le Dicq was built to try to hold back the sea somewhat. There are remains of a submerged forest underneath the sand at Grève d'Azette that show how the parish has reduced in size as the sea has advanced. Large floods in 1688, 1796 and 1812 led to the coast road at Le Hocq being swept away by the sea and necessitated the coast road being rebuilt further inland. In pre-Norman times, the area now known as St. Clement was known as Petravilla or Pierreville. In 1172 it was recorded that a chapel existed in the parish, and there was a priory on the site of the old Priory Inn (now houses). In the 16th and 17th centuries the parish was believed to be the centre of a witch movement. According to beliefs, the rock at Rocque Berg (known as the Witches' Rock) was the focus for witchcraft in Jersey and witches would assemble there for their sabbats on Friday nights. After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, many French Protestants settled in the parish – as recorded on the church register. In the mid 19th century, the town began to spread east from St. Helier into the west of the parish. Today there is relatively little open green space (with the exception of the golf and football fields) west of Samarès Lane into St. Helier. The famous French writer Victor Hugo lived in Marina Terrace, St. Clement for some time, and it was here that he wrote his collection of poems entitled Les Châtiments. It was the Connétable of St. Clement at the time who escorted Hugo onto a steamer bound for Guernsey when he had insulted the British Royal Family in some of his letters.Balleine, 1970 ==Vingtaines== The parish is divided into vingtaines for administrative purposes as follows: *La Grande Vingtaine *La Vingtaine du Rocquier *La Vingtaine de Samarès The parish forms one electoral district and elects two Deputies. ==Demographics== View of housing in the parish in 2012 The population of St. Clement, according to the 2011 census is 9,221.2011 census results ==Politics== Aside from the two deputies who sit in the States of Jersey and represent the parish, St. Clement also has its own local administration. This, like each of the other eleven parishes, is made up of a Connétable, who is elected for a three-year term and has a seat in the States Chamber, and on the Comité des Connétables; two Procureurs du Bien Public, who are also elected and oversee the finances of the parish; a Recteur (or Rector), responsible for the parish church; members of the parish Honorary Police (made up of Centeniers, Vingteniers and Constable's Officers); and other officers such as churchwardens, roads inspectors, rates assessors and a registrar. The current Connétable of St. Clement is Mr. Len Norman. The seat of the parish administration is the Salle Paroissiale, or Parish Hall, which is pictured above and located at Le Hocq. This is the newest parish hall in the island; the previous parish hall in St. Clement was located at Caldwell Hall, on La Grande Route de St Clément (St. Clement's Inner Road). ==Education== Le Rocquier School in 2013. St. Clement has two primary schools and one secondary school within its borders. Le Rocquier School is a secondary school, on La Grande Route de St Clement. The original school buildings were replaced with a new building in 2006. The parish school of St. Clement is located on Rue de la Chapelle, a short distance from Le Rocquier School. The original buildings dates back to 1901, and was replaced in 2006 with a brand new building on the opposite side of the road. Samarès School (formerly Le Squez School) is the other primary school, which is located further east in School Road.Samares Primary School ==Churches== The Samarès Methodist Church building in 2012. The parish church of St. ClementSt. Clement's Church is an ancient place of Anglican worship located on La Grande Route de St Clément (St. Clement's inner road). St. Nicholas is a smaller, sister church, located on La Grande Route de la Côte (the coast road). It was opened in 1927 after being planned, financed and largely built by the Reverend L.B. Lee. The St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church is located on La Grande Route de St Clément at Samarès. The Samarès Methodist ChurchSamares Methodist Church is located on La Grande Route de la Côte, and is the southernmost church in the British Isles. However, as of February 2012, there are no longer any religious services at the church, but the church remains open for use as a community centre. ==Significant sites== La Motte is a tidal island and archaeological site The dolmen at Mont Ubé (off La Blinerie) is believed to have been left there by a pre-Celtic race called the Iberians, in around 3,000 B.C. Remains of a cemetery on La Motte (Green Island) are believed to be from later settlers. A Neolithic cairn and middens on La Motte have also been investigated. Samarès Manor (Jèrriais: Mangni d'Sanmathès) is a manor house with medieval origins in the Vingtaine de Samarès, and is the traditional home of the Seigneur de Samarès. The name Samarès is an old French word meaning salt-marsh, and much of the low lying surrounding areas are or were coastal marshes. Le Hocq Tower was built in 1778 as a coastal defence against the French when they sided with the American colonies against the British. The whole rocky inter-tidal zone that stretches along St. Clement's coast from St. Saviour to Grouville is part of a Ramsar site of special significance. Seymour Tower sits two miles offshore on one of the largest inter-tidal reefs in the world.

Rubab and her two children, Sakina and Ali Asghar, accompanied Husayn to Karbala. In hagiography about the Battle, Husayn's camp at one time was cut off from water supplies from 7th moharram till Ashura and so Husayn went to Yazid's besieging forces to plead water for the women and children in his camp. Husayn had brought along Ali Asghar for mercy, but Yazid's soldiers then martyred Ali by an arrow to his throat. Shia tradition relates that Ali Asghar was martyred by an opposing soldier named Hurmala with a three-headed arrow, when he moved his neck to stop the arrow from hitting his father.

The parish is in the south east of the island and is dominated by the broad sweep of the Royal Bay of Grouville. The parish covers a surface area of 4,354 vergées (7.8 km²). It borders Saint Clement, Saint Saviour and Saint Martin. ==History== The parish of Grouville shares, with the neighbouring parish of Saint Martin, a dedication to Saint Martin of Tours. The ecclesiastical parish and parish church are dedicated to \\"Saint Martin de Grouville\\" to distinguish them from the parish of Saint Martin (historically 'Saint Martin le Vieux'). The Church of St Peter la Rocque was built in the 19th century. The name 'Grouville' may derive from: * the small community established in what is now the parish by St Gerou (also known as Gervold or Geraldius), an ecclesiastical troubleshooter in the employ of Charlemagne in the 9th century AD; *Gros Villa (great farm) *Geirr, the Viking leader after whom the Island may be named. the name Groult or Gueroult is often found today in Normandy and is believed to derive from the ancient probably Norman name Gueroalt (Geirroalt) The Royal Bay of Grouville gained its royal epithet when it impressed Queen Victoria during her visit in 1846. The bay is popular with tourists for its broad sandy beach and shallow, warm water. It is also the main oyster producing area of Jersey, and was also formerly noted for the production of vraic. The cottage industry formerly practised by Grouvillais of burning vraic gave rise to the traditional nickname of les Enfuntchis (the smoky ones, or the dim ones, in Jèrriais) shared by the Grouvillais and their neighbours in St. Clement. Inland, the parish is also home to Jersey's most noted archaeological site at La Hougue Bie, now a museum run by the Jersey Heritage Trust. A prehistoric artificial mound covers a passage grave aligned for the equinox. A mediaeval chapel, Notre Dame de la Clarté, built on the Neolithic mound was converted in the 18th century to a folly-like Gothic Revival residence, the Prince's Tower (demolished in the 1920s). During the Second World War, the occupying German forces constructed bunkers in and alongside the ancient mound, now also transformed for museum interpretation. La Rocque was the site of the landing of the French forces on 6 January 1781. The skirmish at La Platte Rocque was ancillary to the Battle of Jersey. The Royal Jersey Golf Club, Gorey Village, and Queen's Valley (now flooded to form a reservoir) are situated in the parish. In modern times, Grouville has been a popular holiday destination, and features a number of hotels. These include the Beausite Hotel, which is a later 20th century structure but incorporates a small structure dating back to 1636 which now serves as the hotel's bar. ==Demographics== ==Vingtaines== Grouville is divided for administrative purposes into vingtaines as follows: *La Vingtaine des Marais *La Vingtaine de la Rue *La Vingtaine de Longueville *La Vingtaine de la Rocque The Minquiers are part of the parish of Grouville.

Historically it was called \\"Saint Martin le Vieux\\" to distinguish it from the present day parish of Grouville (historically \\"Saint Martin de Grouville\\"). St. Martin is the only parish in Jersey not to conduct its municipal business from a Parish Hall. St. Martin has a Public Hall instead, having accepted money from the States of Jersey to provide an assembly room. ==Dolmens== The dolmens at Le Couperon and Faldouet are among the prehistoric remains in the parish. La Pouquelaye de Faldouet features on the reverse of the Jersey ten pence coin (see coins of the Jersey pound) and was the inspiration for the poem Nomen, numen, lumen written by Victor Hugo in 1855 during his exile in Jersey. The rock known as Le Saut Geffroy, or Geoffroy's Leap, is reputed to be an ancient place of execution where criminals were thrown into the sea. According to folklore, a man named Geffroy was condemned to be thrown into the sea. Remarkably, he survived and climbed back up the cliff face where an argument broke out among the mob of spectators. Some said that sentence had been duly carried out and that Geffroy should go free; others said that sentence had not been properly carried out. To settle the argument, and demonstrate his prowess, Geffroy dived off the rock, but perished on this occasion. Le Saut Geffroy is now preserved by the National Trust for Jersey. ==Geography== The dolmen (in Jèrriais, pouquelaye or archaically pouclée) at Faldouet gives rise to the longest road name in Jersey: Rue de la Pouclée et des Quatre Chemins The ancient castle of Mont Orgueil dominates the small harbour and village of Gorey. The castle served as the island's prison until a prison was constructed in St. Helier in the 17th century. Among agitators imprisoned there by the British government were William Prynne and John Lilburne. Until the construction of Elizabeth Castle off St. Helier at the beginning of the 17th century, Mont Orgueil was generally the residence of the Governor of Jersey. The 600m breakwater at St. Catherine is all that remains of a grandiose harbour project started, but then abandoned, by the British government in the 19th century. It is now a popular site for sea anglers. St. Martin is one of the remaining strongholds of Jèrriais with a distinctive accent. The area around Faldouet formerly possessed a dialect of its own, known as Faldouais, of which the distinctive feature was the realisation of intervocalic /r/ as /z/. Although the Faldouais dialect is extinct, it has left notable amounts of writings in Jèrriais literature. The artist Edmund Blampied was born at Ville Brée on 30 March 1886. This is one of the most agricultural parishes, and one of the most sought after places to live in the island. It has the best herd of Jersey cattle, some of the largest potato growers and a number of small farmers now cultivating the new “Genuine Jersey”, mainly organic, brand. ==Demographics== ==Subdivisions== The Parish Church of St. Martin Le Vieux in 2012 St. Martin is divided into vingtaines as follows: * La Vingtaine de Rozel * La Vingtaine de Faldouet * La Vingtaine de la Quéruée * La Vingtaine de l'Église * La Vingtaine du Fief de la Reine The Écréhous, small group of rocky islands, are part of the parish of St. Martin.

It allows a listener to adjust the tone of the sound produced by an audio system to their liking, for example to compensate for inadequate bass response of loudspeakers or earphones, tonal qualities of the room, or hearing impairment. A tone control circuit is an electronic circuit that consists of a network of filters which modify the signal before it is fed to speakers, headphones or recording devices by way of an amplifier. Tone controls are found on many sound systems: radios, portable music players, boomboxes, public address systems, and musical instrument amplifiers. ==Uses== Tone control allows listeners to adjust sound to their liking. It also enables them to compensate for recording deficiencies, hearing impairments, room acoustics or shortcomings with playback equipment. For example, older people with hearing problems may want to increase the loudness of high pitch sounds they have difficulty hearing. Tone control is also used to adjust an audio signal during recording. For instance, if the acoustics of the recording site cause it to absorb some frequencies more than others, tone control can be used to amplify or \\"boost\\" the frequencies the room dampens. ==Types== In their most basic form, tone control circuits attenuate the high or low frequencies of the signal. This is called treble or bass \\"cut\\". The simplest tone control circuits are passive circuits which utilize only resistors and capacitors or inductors. They rely on the property of capacitive reactance or inductive reactance to inhibit or enhance an AC signal, in a frequency-dependent manner. Active tone controls may also amplify or \\"boost\\" certain frequencies. More elaborate tone control circuits can boost or attenuate the middle range of frequencies. The simplest tone control is a single knob that when turned in one direction enhances treble frequencies and the other direction enhances bass frequencies. This was the first type of tone control, typically found on radios and record players from the 1930s to the 1970s. Graphic equalizers used for tone control provide independent elevation or attenuation of individual bands of frequencies. Wide frequency range graphic equalizers of high resolution can provide elevation or attenuation in 1/3 octave bands spanning from approximately 30 Hz to 18 kHz. Parametric equalizers can control not only the amount of boost and cut but also the specific frequency at which the boost and cut takes place and the range of frequencies (bandwidth) affected. Elaborate circuits may also use amplifiers. The most modern analog units use operational amplifiers, resistors and capacitors, abandoning inductors because of their size and sensitivity to ubiquitous electromagnetic interference. Historically, tone control was achieved via analog electronics, and most tone control circuits produced today still use the analog process. Nonetheless, digital approaches are increasingly being implemented through the use of digital signal processing. == See also == *Audio amplifier *Electronic filter *Audio crossover *Equalization (audio) == External links == *The Peter-James-Baxandall Passive Tone-Control Network *Amplifiers and tone controls *Audio tone controls *Negative-Feedback Tone Control - Independent Variation of Bass and Treble Without Switches by P.

Les Platons is the highest point in Jersey. Trinity has the reputation of being the most rural of Jersey's parishes, being the third- largest parish by surface area with the third-smallest population. The parish covers 6,817 vergées (). It is home to the States Farm, the Durrell Wildlife Park at Les Augrès Manor, the headquarters of the Royal Jersey Agricultural and Horticultural Society at the Royal Jersey Showground, and the Pallot Heritage Steam Museum. The coat of arms of the Parish of Trinity shows the Shield of the Trinity diagram. ==Buildings and monuments== The Parish church, with its distinctive white pyramidal spire, is a notable landmark. The Le Vesconte memorial (erected 1910) takes the form of an obelisk at a crossroads commemorating Philippe Le Vesconte (21 December 1837 - 21 August 1909) who was 10 times elected Constable between 1868–1877 and 1890-1909. Trinity Manor is the home of the Seigneur of Trinity. Athelstan Riley purchased Trinity Manor in 1909. Finding the manor house in a ruined condition, he undertook an elaborate restoration (or \\"imaginative reconstruction\\", which has been criticised as turning the building into a French style châteauThe Bailiwick of Jersey, G.

In folklore, the area of Bouley has been reputed to be haunted by the Tchian d'Bouôlé (Black Dog of Bouley), a phantom dog whose appearance presages storms. The story is believed to have been encouraged by smugglers who wanted to discourage nocturnal movements by people who might witness the movement of contraband at the harbour in Bouley.

This is quite a small village centred around the main road. It has a small shop and a garage. The cliffs of the north coast afford some of the best views in Jersey. After Trinity, it has the second highest point in Jersey at Mont Mado (473 ft). The parish covers territory of 4,846 vergées (8.7 km².). There is a single usable beach in the parish at the Bonne Nuit harbour, accessible by a hilly windy road that connects to the village. Mont Mado granite was quarried historically. The largest quarry is now that of Ronez on the north coast. The main road for the parish is the A9, which runs from the parish church and connects the main settlements (Hautes Croix and Sion) of the parish before running along a lightly developed road to the town. It connects all the way to the waterfront. Other main link roads include the A8 which runs to Trinity, the B33 which continues on from the A9 and runs eastward to St Mary and the A10 which starts in the south of the village and runs down towards St Lawrence. The parish is served by three bus routes that connect the parish to St Mary, St Lawrence, Trinity and St Helier.

It is situated in the north west and covers an area of 3,604 vergées (6.5 km²). It borders four other parishes: Saint Ouen, Saint John, Saint Peter and Saint Lawrence. The parish and its eponymous church derive their name from a medieval monastery, probably destroyed during Viking raids some time between the 8th and 10th centuries. In 1042 Duke William gave \\"Saint Mary of the Burnt Monastery\\" to the abbey of Cerisy. == Geography == The Elms, constructed around 1740, is currently the headquarters of the National Trust for Jersey. Close to Devil's Hole, in a little tree covered pond, is the figure of the Devil. Among the natural attractions of the parish is a feature known as the Devil's Hole (Lé Creux du Vis), a blowhole in the cliffs of the coast. The descent from the car park to the Devil's Hole is a popular tourist attraction, with the walk taking approximately ten minutes. The upper part of the path is surfaced, and the lower part, once quite dangerous in parts, now has wooden steps and handrails, with much of the access having been improved by a working party from the Royal Engineers Corps of the British Army. In Victorian times it was possible to descend into the hole itself at low tide, but this is no longer possible. However, the access path ends at a large specially constructed viewing platform. Following a shipwreck in 1851, when the ship's figurehead washed up in the Devil's Hole, a statue of a devil adapted from the figurehead was set up above the Hole.\\"Turnkey\\" Giffard and the Devil This wooden statue was replaced by a succession of modern versions in the 20th century.

On the east side of the bay, in Saint Mary, lies Le Castel de Lecq, a mediaeval earthwork. In the bay Le Moulin de Lecq, an old watermill, was converted into a residence in 1929 and following the Second World War became a pub, while retaining the wheel and remnants of the gears. The parish stands upon coarse-grained granite, 'of Saint Mary's type', which formed during the lower Palaeozoic period.

It is in the north west of Jersey. The parish is the largest parish by surface area, covering 8,341 vergées (15 km²). It is reputed to be the most traditional of the parishes, being the farthest from Saint Helier and with much of the territory of the parish forming a peninsula. Its manor, Saint Ouen's Manor, the seat of the de Carteret family for over eight centuries - is the senior fief in the island, and the influence of that family has also been a factor in the parish's independent-minded approach to its affairs. ==Culture== Ruins of Grosnez CastlePrehistoric site of Le PinacleParish Hall A number of the most influential writers of Jersey have been St. Ouennais. George F. Le Feuvre (1891–1984), who wrote under the pseudonym \\"George d'la Forge\\", was one of the most prolific authors of Jèrriais literature of the 20th century. Frank Le Maistre (1910–2002), compiler of the Dictionnaire Jersiais-Français (1966), did much to standardise the St. Ouennais dialect of Jèrriais as a literary language. Edward Le Brocq (1877–1964) wrote a weekly newspaper column from 1946 to 1964 recounting the lives and opinions of two St. Ouennais characters, Ph'lip and Merrienne. The traditional nickname for St. Ouennais is Gris Ventres (grey bellies) - a reference to the custom of men from the parish to wear jerseys of undyed wool, which distinguished them from men from other parishes who generally wore blue. A number of prehistoric sites are located in St. Ouen, including the dolmen des Monts Grantez, located at Le Chemin des Monts; the dolmen des Geonnais; and the prehistoric site at Le Pinacle, which also contains one of the very few identifiable Gallo-Roman sites to be seen in Jersey, the foundations of a fanum (small temple). In the north west, the ruins of Grosnez Castle are a landmark which also features on the Jersey 50 pence coin (see coins of the Jersey pound). The Island's racecourse is also to be found at Les Landes. ==Language== Ouennais influence can be seen in nearby Sark. Sark was recolonised by St. Ouennais. Helier de Carteret, the seigneur of the parish, received a charter from Queen Elizabeth I to colonise Sark with 40 families from the parish on condition that he maintain the island free of pirates. Sercquiais is therefore a very old offshoot of St Ouennais Jèrriais. The St. Ouennais origins of Sercquiais can be seen in the 2nd and 3rd person plural forms of the preterite. Sercquiais uses an ending -dr which is typical of the St. Ouennais dialect of Jèrriais, but generally not used elsewhere in Jersey (nor nowadays by younger speakers in St. Ouen). { - ! style=\\"width:100px;\\"Sercquiais ! style=\\"width:100px;\\"Jèrriais (St. Ouennais) ! style=\\"width:100px;\\"standard Jèrriais ! style=\\"width:100px;\\"English - i vuliidri' voulîdrenti' voulîtentthey wanted - uu paaliidrou pâlîdresou pâlîtesyou spoke - i füüdri' fûdrenti' fûtentthey were - uu prẽẽdrou prîndresou prîntesyou took } ==Demographics== ==Cueillettes== Unlike the other parishes of Jersey, the subdivisions of this parish are not named vingtaines, but cueillettes (Jèrriais: tchilliettes).

After his father died of cancer in 1960, the Powells returned to the United States to settle in Jacksonville, Florida. In elementary school, Powell met Leon Wilkeson, who became a lifelong friend and the bassist for Lynyrd Skynyrd. Powell took an interest in piano and he began taking piano lessons from a local teacher named Madalyn Brown, who claimed that Billy did not need a teacher as he was a natural and picked things up well on his own. When it was time for high school, his mother enrolled Billy and his brother, Ricky, at Sanford Naval Academy in Sanford, Florida. Powell returned to Jacksonville, where he enrolled at Bishop Kenny High School. After graduation in 1970, he enrolled at and briefly attended a community college, majoring in music theory. ===Musical career=== Lynyrd Skynyrd: Crew Around 1970, Powell found work as a roadie for Lynyrd Skynyrd and remained a member of the Skynyrd crew for two years, during which the band secured a support role for the band Mountain. In 1972, Skynyrd played a show at the Bolles School prom. During a break at that event, Powell sat down at a piano and launched into his piano- based version of \\"Free Bird\\". When the band realized their roadie's ability, he was offered the position of keyboardist. Jimmy Johnson, studio guitarist known for being a member of The Swampers, said Billy played his version of Freebird when the band took a lunch break while recording what would become Skynyrds First...and Last. The band returned from lunch to hear Billy playing and a few weeks later he was offered a full position in the band. Lynyrd Skynyrd: Keyboardist In 1973, Lynyrd Skynyrd was signed to MCA Records and received national exposure following the release of their first album, (pronounced 'lĕh-'nérd 'skin-'nérd). The band's popularity soared in 1974 with their follow-up album, Second Helping, which featured their highest-charting single, \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\". The band enjoyed increasing popularity over the next three years, culminating in the 1977 release of Street Survivors. Three days after the release of Street Survivors, Skynyrd's chartered Convair CV-240 crashed into a forest near McComb, Mississippi. The crash took the lives of singer Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Steve Gaines, his sister and backing vocalist Cassie Gaines, assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, and both pilots. The remainder of the band suffered mild to severe injuries. Powell suffered severe facial lacerations, almost losing his nose, but was otherwise relatively uninjured. He was the first to be released from the hospital, and the only member able to attend the funerals of his fallen bandmates. Vision During the time between the plane crash and the Lynyrd Skynyrd reunion in 1987, Powell joined a Christian rock band, Vision, in 1984, recorded three albums (Mountain in The Sky, Vision, and Streetfighter), and toured extensively. His keyboard performances were spotlighted in Vision concerts. During the concerts, Powell spoke about his newfound Christianity; messages that were also delivered via two bonus tracks (Leon Wilkeson and Billy Powell) included on the album Mountain in The Sky. Lynyrd Skynyrd (return) Powell rejoined Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1987 for a tribute tour, and remained with the band until his death. At the time of his death, he and guitarist Gary Rossington were the only members from the classic lineup who were active in the band. Kid Rock In 2007, two years before his death, Powell played piano on Kid Rock's summer anthem All Summer Long. ===Death=== On January 28, 2009, Powell died at the age of 56 at his home in Orange Park, Florida.Soergel, Matt. \\"Lynyrd Skynyrd keyboard player Billy Powell dead at 56 \\", The Florida Times-Union, January 28, 2009. Retrieved 2009-01-31. It was during a break from Skynyrd's touring schedule that Powell suffered a fatal heart attack. His passing inspired countless tributes, in and out of the Southern rock community and extending across the country-music world, where he had many friends and admirers. The music he had recorded with Vision was played exclusively at a private memorial service, and Kid Rock sang a tribute.

Originally published by the Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG), it is currently published under licence by Crafty Games. ==History== Originally envisioned—and initially publicised—as a paranormal superspy game called Series Archer, the game was split into 2 complementary product lines: Spycraft (silver trade dress) which devoted itself to a generic cinematic superspy/action setting, and Shadowforce Archer (black trade dress) which featured a setting focused on a global shadow conspiracy based on a wide variety of supernatural elements. After the release of the core book (subsequently referred to as the Spycraft Espionage HandbookSpycraft Espionage Handbook . Crafty Games product page. Retrieved 7 January 2008.) in 2002, multiple print supplements were released in the following years for both lines. Each of these books sported highly distinctive cover art by artist Veronica V. Jones. A new edition of the rules, Spycraft 2.0, was released in August 2005.Spycraft. RPG Resource. Retrieved 7 January 2008. Shortly afterwards, economic issues forced AEG to cull Spycraft from its product range. As a result, early in 2006 the core authors of the 2nd edition – Alex Flagg, Scott Gearin and Patrick Kapera (who also co-authored Spycraft 1.0)) – formed Crafty Games to continue the line under licence, predominantly through PDF file releases supported by strategic print releases. This model has changed over time, permitting a growing number of print releases including compilations of previous PDF releases.

The mechanic would later evolve into the slightly more simulist meta-Departments before then being used to model non-humans. * Characters gained both a Defense and Initiative bonus which improved with their character levels, while armor instead adds damage resistance rather than add to defense (Armor Class). * Modern day skills like Computers and Electronics were added to the skill list. Characters in Spycraft can also critically succeed or critically fail at skill checks. * A system for resolving high-speed chases was included in the main rulebook (and expanded somewhat in later supplements). The system involves both sides of the chase picking maneuvers with specific game effects and then rolling a contest of skill to determine which takes effect. The system was later used by the d20 conversion of White Wolf Publishing's Aeonverse games. * Characters kept a certain amount of personal gear, but the gear would be replaced by the Agency the characters worked for when lost. Characters also received additional gear for each mission based on the threat level code of the mission (White, Yellow, Red, or Black). * Characters received a number of \\"Action Dice\\" based on their character level (and feat selection) for each play session. These Action Dice would be used during play to add to die rolls or to activate a critical success (or critical failure on the part of your opponents). The Game Control (Spycraft's term for a Game Master) also received a number of Action Dice to use for his NPCs, and could award the players (and himself) additional Action Dice for particularly good play. ===Spycraft 2.0=== Spycraft 2.0 took these changes a step further and was released under the Open Game Licence (OGL), but not the d20 System Trademark License. There were also numerous changes from Classic Spycraft, such as: * New character options, including Wealth and Interests, help flesh out characters more effectively. * The introduction of plug-and-play modifications called Campaign Qualities that allow characters to advance in some skills and abilities faster at the expense of others that slow down by the same rate. Other Campaign Qualities have more general effects like setting the game in a specific time period, or making combat more dangerous than it already is. * Each character chooses an Origin at character creation. Unlike D&D;'s Race mechanic and Classic Spycraft's Departments, Origins consist of two parts which allow players to choose an almost unending variety of character benefits and detriments. * The skills system has been largely reworked. The d20 System skill list has been replaced by a new list, and each skill has a variety of codified checks that that skill can perform. The skills rules more rigorously detail matters that were often left to group contract in other d20 System games. * A re-designed gear system that simplifiesSpycraft 2.0 Rulebook Second Printing. Crafty Games product page. Retrieved 7 January 2008. one of the more unwieldy parts of Classic Spycraft. Budget and Gear Points have been replaced with Common Items, and a number of Gear Picks based on a character's class and gadgets can now be designed freeform style. * Vehicular chases have been expanded into a new rules mechanic called Dramatic Conflicts. The one system covers chases, seduction, hacking and other suitably dramatic events. * Mission and NPC creation have been redesigned, and are now crafted to give a set amount of XP based on their ability instead of using Challenge Ratings. As well, it is presumably a relatively simple exercise to create a mission. ==Campaign settingsClassic Spycraft=== Shadowforce Archer The first of all the Spycraft campaign settings. The world of Shadowforce Archer (SFA) is an Earth where mystical and psionic powers are real. A series of supplemental books that were released to support the SFA worldbook. Each book details one of the international Chambers of the world. Each book has a different theme and includes new rules and agent options appropriate to the theme. The setting was discontinued at the beginning of 2005. Spycraft 2.0 contains many classes and feats that first appeared in the SFA line. The Shadowforce Archer World Book has recently been re-released in PDF format by Crafty Games. The rest of the SFA line will also be made available in PDF format throughout the rest of the year (and possibly into the next). *Archer Foundation Chamber Book [AEG1001]: Details the continent of Australia and the South Pacific region. The theme is super-espionage, conspiracy and paranoia and is an expansion and continuation of the plot and events in the main worldbook. *Pan-Asian Collective Chamber Book [AEG1005]: Details the continent of Asia and the Pacific Rim. The themes are Martial Arts fighting, Anime-style high tech, and hard-boiled Hong Kong action. *European Commonwealth Chamber Book [AEG1006]: Details the continent of Europe. The themes are techno-thriller, suspense, and double-crosses. *African Alliance Chamber Book [AEG1007]: Details the continent of Africa. The themes are action, adventure, misdirection, and mystery. Dark Inheritance Released in 2004 by Mythic Dreams Studios, Dark Inheritance (DI) was originally a d20 Modern campaign setting but converted across to the Powered by Spycraft banner using the Classic Spycraft rules. It describes an Earth that has been ravaged by ancient mystical powers, allowing Demons and other foul beasts access to this dimension. The setting book contains new rules that allow agents to play as Titans (powerful descendants of antediluvian demi- gods), worship the demonic forces and gain access to mystic powers (reprinted from the SFA world book). There are a number of supplements planned for DI, similar in fashion to those for SFA. There is no release date as yet for any of these supplements. ===Spycraft 2.0=== World On Fire Released in December 2007, World On Fire is the title of the world book that covers the setting detailed in the Spycraft CCG. Agents are able to fight the forces of evil alongside such groups as the Shadow Patriots and Banshee.Net. The book features even more character options (in the form of new origins, base and expert classes, and new master classes for higher level characters). New classes include the Ace, the Centurion, the Edgemaster, the Fixer, the Forward, the Goliath, the High Roller, the Martial Artist, the Medic, the Menace, the Mole, the Ninja, the Provocateur, the Saboteur, the Spin Doctor, the Street Knight, and the Terrorist. Fantasy Craft Fantasy Craft was released in both hardcover and PDF formats in 2009 through the Flaming Cobra imprint of Mongoose Publishing. Following Crafty Games' parting with Mongoose,http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/17070.html a soft-covered second printing incorporating the errata generated up to that point was released in 2010. Originally the game was intended for release as an expansion of the Spycraft 2.0 ruleset, following up the first two Origin of the Species electronic products that added character creation options for a variety of standard fantasy and classical Greek non-humans to the ruleset. During the development process, the decision was made by Crafty Games to instead take the opportunity to significantly streamline the game mechanics in response to user feedback and create the ruleset referred to as Mastercraft. This permitted the release of Fantasy Craft as a standalone product under the Open Gaming Licence, including full rules for character generation, conversion mechanics for monsters found in the System Resource Document, and the tools for creating, populating and presenting user-generated campaign settings to players. Fantasy Craft was nominated in 2010 for an Origins award for best RPG and an ENnie for Best Writing; it also received an honorable mention at that year's ENnies for Product of the Year. 2010 also saw two further Fantasy Craft soft-covered print products, both of which reprinted previously electronically published material. The first was Time of High Adventure, which compiled the previously published \\"The Darkest Hour\\" and \\"Cleansing of Black Spur\\" and added a third original mission as well as a chapter expanding upon the implied setting of all three modules. This was followed up by the Adventure Companion, which contained 3 campaign settings originally intended for release as part of the core book before being cut for space, and a fourth chapter offering a number of new game mechanic options, including a compilation of the non- spellcasting \\"Call to Arms\\" character class releases, some additional classes and a small library of additional specialities, feats and tricks. A fourth print release titled Spellbound is currently slated for publication. In addition to compiling the spellcasting \\"Call to Arms\\" character class releases, its content is focused on greatly expanding the mechanical and narrative options for magic use in a Fantasy Craft game. Ten Thousand Bullets Long teased on the Spycraft forums under the name 'Project X', Ten Thousand Bullets is a gritty crime setting intended to bring Spycraft down to street level with new rules to allow players to become police, gangsters and everything in between. Originally intended for release at Gen Con Indy 2007, the creative process behind Fantasy Craft has resulted in its being slated for release as a Mastercraft title. ==Organized play== Spycraft has a long history with organized play and living campaigns. For 5 years Spycraft could be played as part of the Living Spycraft campaign, which was a part of the RPGA (Role Playing Game Association) network of Living Campaign settings. The Living Spycraft campaign had been in the planning stages for a while before RPGA approval was provided on 29 August 2002 with the campaign starting properly in October 2002 utilising the, then current, Classic Spycraft rules. In 2005 the campaign converted to the Spycraft 2.0 rules but, at the end of 2007, Crafty Games ended the campaign although the original campaign scenarios are still available as free downloads. A number of volunteers who ran the Living Spycraft campaign restarted it independently as Spymaster but this campaign ceased in 2010. Likewise, in 2008 a UK-only campaign, called For Queen & Country, started. This campaign utilises a version of Classic Spycraft that incorporates aspects of Spycraft 2.0. ==SupplementsClassic Spycraft=== * Modern Arms Guide (AEG (print), Crafty Games (PDF)) * Gentleman's Agreement (AEG (print), Crafty Games (PDF)) * Game Control Screen (AEG (print), Crafty Games (PDF)) * Soldier/Wheelman Class Guide (AEG (print), Crafty Games (PDF)) * Fixer/Pointman Class Guide (AEG (print), Crafty Games (PDF)) * Faceman/Snoop Class Guide (AEG (print), Crafty Games (PDF)) * The 1960s Decade Book (AEG (print), Crafty Games (PDF)) * Most Wanted (Paradigm Concepts (print)) * Agency (AEG (print), Crafty Games (PDF)) * Mastermind (AEG (print), Crafty Games (PDF)) * U.S. Militaries (AEG (print), Crafty Games (PDF)) * World Militaries (AEG (print), Crafty Games (PDF)) * Battlegrounds (AEG (print), Crafty Games (PDF)) Crafty Games has re-released the first edition books in PDF format.PDF Store Crafty Games PDF Store.

Aldrin is a member of the so-called \\"classic organochlorines\\" (COC) group of pesticides. COCs enjoyed a very sharp rise in popularity during and after The Second World War. Other noteworthy examples of COCs include DDT. After research showed that organochlorines can be highly toxic to the ecosystem through bioaccumulation, most were banned from use. It is a colourless solid. Before the ban, it was heavily used as a pesticide to treat seed and soil. Aldrin and related \\"cyclodiene\\" pesticides (a term for pesticides derived from Hexachlorocyclopentadiene) became notorious as persistent organic pollutants.Robert L. Metcalf \\"Insect Control\\" in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry\\" Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. == Structure & Reactivity == The structure formula of aldrin is C12H8Cl6. The molecule has a molecular weight of 364.896 g/mol. The melting point of aldrin is a temperature of 105 °C and the octanol-water partition coefficient is 6.5 (logP). Pure aldrin takes form as a white crystalline powder. Though it is not soluble in water (0.003%% solubility), aldrin dissolves very well in organic solvents, such as ketones and paraffins. Aldrin decays very slowly once released into the environment. Though it is rapidly converted to dieldrin by plants and bacteria, dieldrin maintains the same toxic effects and slow decay of aldrin. Aldrin is easily transported through the air by dust particles. Aldrin does not react with mild acids or bases and is stable in an environment with a pH between 4 and 8. It is highly flammable when exposed to temperatures above 200 °C In the presence of oxidizing agents aldrin reacts with concentrated acids and phenols. ==Synthesis== Aldrin is not formed in nature. It is synthesized by combining hexachlorocyclopentadiene with norbornadiene in a Diels-Alder reaction to give the adduct. In 1967, the composition of technical-grade aldrin was reported to consist of 90.5% of hexachlorohexahydrodimethanonaphthalene (HHDN). Synthesis of aldrin via a Diels-Alder reaction Similarly, an isomer of aldrin, known as isodrin, is produced by reaction of hexachloronobornadiene with cyclopentadiene. Isodrin is also produced as a byproduct of aldrin synthesis, with technical-grade aldrin containing about 3,5% isodrin. Aldrin is named after the German chemist Kurt Alder, one of the coinventors of this kind of reaction. An estimated 270 million kilograms of aldrin and related cyclodiene pesticides were produced between 1946 and 1976. == Available forms == There are multiple available forms of aldrin. One of these is the isomer isodrin, which cannot be found in nature, but needs to be synthesized like aldrin. When aldrin enters the human body or the environment it is rapidly converted to dieldrin. Degradation by ultraviolet radiation or microbes can convert dieldrin to photodieldrin and aldrin to photoaldrin. == Mechanism of action == Even though many toxic effects of aldrin have been discovered, the exact mechanisms underlying the toxicity are yet to be determined. The only toxic aldrin induced process that is largely understood is that of neurotoxicity. === Neurotoxicity === One of the effects that intoxication with aldrin gives rise to is neurotoxicity. Studies have shown that aldrin stimulates the central nervous system (CNS), which may cause hyperexcitation and seizures. This phenomenon exerts its effect through two different mechanisms. One of the mechanisms uses the ability of aldrin to inhibit brain calcium ATPases. These ion pumps relieve the nerve terminal from calcium by actively pumping it out. However, when aldrin inhibits these pumps, the intracellular calcium levels rise. This results in an enhanced neurotransmitter release. The second mechanism makes use of aldrin's ability to block gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity. GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Aldrin induces neurotoxic effects by blocking the GABAA receptor-chloride channel complex. By blocking this receptor, chloride is unable to move into the synapse, which prevents hyperpolarization of neuronal synapses. Therefore, the synapses are more likely to generate action potentials. == Metabolism == The metabolism of oral aldrin exposure has not been studied in humans. However, animal studies are able to provide an extensive overview of the metabolism of aldrin. This data can be related to humans. Biotransformation of aldrin starts with epoxidation of aldrin by mixed-function oxidases (CYP-450), which forms dieldrin. This conversion happens mainly in the liver. Tissues with low CYP-450 expression use the prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (PES) instead. This oxidative pathway bisdioxygenises the arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2 (PGG2). Subsequently, PGG2 is reduced to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) by hydroperoxidase. Dieldrin can then be directly oxidized by cytochrome oxidases, which forms 9-hydroxydieldrin. An alternative for oxidation involves the opening of the epoxied ring by epoxied hydrases, which forms the product 6,7-trans-dihydroxydihydroaldrin. Both products can be conjugated to form 6,7-trans-dihydroxydihydroaldrin glucuronide and 9-hydroxydieldrin glucuronide, respectively. 6,7-trans-dihydroxydihydroaldrin can also be oxidized to form aldrin dicarboxylic acid. == Efficacy and side effects == Considering the toxicokinetics of aldrin in the environment, the efficacy of the compound has been determined. In addition, the adverse effects after exposure to the aldrin are demonstrated, indicating the risk regarding the compound. === Efficacy === The ability of aldrin, in its use for the control of termites, is examined in order to determine the maximum response when applied. In 1953 US researchers tested aldrin and dieldrin on terrains with rats known to carry chiggers, at a rate of 2.25 pound per acre. The Aldrin and Dieldrin treatment demonstrated a decrease of 75 times less chiggers on rats for Dieldrin treated terrains and 25 times less chiggers on the rats when treated with Aldrin. The Aldrin treatment indicate a high productivity, especially in comparison to other insecticide that were used, like DDT, Sulfur or BHC. === Adverse effects === Exposure of Aldrin to the environment leads to the localization of the chemical compound in the air, soil, and water. Aldrin gets changed quickly to dieldrin and that compound degrades slowly, which accounts for aldrin concentrations in the environment around the primary exposure and in the plants. These concentrations can also be found in animals, which eat contaminated plants or animals that reside in the contaminated water. This biomagnification can lead to a high concentrations in their fat. There are some reported cases of workers who developed anemia after multiple dieldrin exposures. However the main adverse effect of Aldrin and Dieldrin is in relationship to the central nervous system. The accumulated levels of Dieldrin in the body were believed to lead to convulsions. Besides that other symptoms were also reported like headaches, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, muscle twitching and myoclonic jerking and EEG distortions. In all these cases removal of the source of exposure to aldrin/dieldrin led to a rapid recovery. == Toxicity == The toxicity of aldrin and dieldrin is determined by the results of several animal studies. Reports of a significant increase in workers death in relation to aldrin has not been found, although death by anemia is reported in some cases after multiple exposure to Aldrin. Immunological tests linked an antigenic response to erythrocytes coated with dieldrin in those cases. Direct dose-response relations being a cause for death are yet to be examined. The NOAEL that was derived from rat studies: * The minimal risk level at acute oral exposure to Aldrin is 0.002 mg/kg/day. * The minimal risk level at intermediate exposure to Dieldrin is 0.0001 mg/kg/day. * The minimal risk level at chronic exposure to Aldrin is 0.00003 mg/kg/day. * The minimal risk level at chronic exposure to Dieldrin is 0.00005 mg/kg/day. In addition to these studies, breast cancer risk studies were performed demonstrating a significant increased breast cancer risk. After comparing blood concentrations to number of lymph nodes and tumor size a 5-fold higher risk of death was determined, comparing the highest quartile range in the research to the lower quartile range. Young children are also more susceptible to the drug, causing severe generalized convulsions. == Effects on animals == Most of the animal studies done with aldrin and dieldrin used rats. High doses of aldrin and dieldrin demonstrated neurotoxicity, but in multiple rat studies also showed a unique sensitivity of the mouse liver to dieldrin induced hepatocarcinogenicity. Furthermore, Aldrin treated rats demonstrated an increased post-natal mortality, in which adults showed an increased susceptibility to the compounds compared to children in rats. ==Environmental impact and regulation== Like related polychlorinated pesticides, aldrin is highly lipophilic. Its solubility in water is only 0.027 mg/L, which exacerbates its persistence in the environment. It was banned by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. In the U.S., aldrin was cancelled in 1974. The substance is banned from use for plant protection by the EU. ==Safety and environmental aspects== Aldrin has rat of 39 to 60 mg/kg (oral in rats). For fish however, it is extremely toxic, with an LC50 of 0.006 – 0.01 for trout and bluegill. In the US, aldrin is considered a potential occupational carcinogen by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; these agencies have set an occupational exposure limit for dermal exposures at 0.25 mg/m3 over an eight-hour time-weighted average. Further, an IDLH limit has been set at 25 mg/m3, based on acute toxicity data in humans to which subjects reacted with convulsions within 20 minutes of exposure. It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities. == References == Category:Obsolete pesticides Category:IARC Group 3 carcinogens Category:Organochloride insecticides Category:Endocrine disruptors Category:Neurotoxins Category:Persistent organic pollutants under the Stockholm Convention Category:Persistent organic pollutants under the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution ","title":"Aldrin"},{"id":"2233430","text":"Dustin Lancy Farnum (May 27, 1874 – July 3, 1929) was an American singer, dancer, and actor on the stage and in silent films.

The parish is divided into two non-contiguous sections, the bulk of the parish lying on the east coast, with a smaller section lying on the west coast. The parish of Vale borders the parish to the north and also extends between the two parts of St. Sampson. What is currently the northern boundary of the parish originally ran along the south coast of Le Braye du Valle, a tidal channel that made the northern extremity of Guernsey, Le Clos du Valle, a tidal island. La Braye du Valle was drained and reclaimed in 1806 by the British Government as a defence measure. The eastern end of the former channel became the town and harbour (from 1820) of St. Sampson's, now the second biggest port in Guernsey. The western end of La Braye is now Le Grand Havre. The roadway called The Bridge across the end of the harbour at St. Sampson's recalls the bridge that formerly linked the two parts of Guernsey at high tide. The Guernésiais nickname for people from St Sampson is roînes (frogs). The postal code for street addresses in this parish begins with GY2. ==Historic facts== St Sampson Harbour The parish church of St. Sampson claims to be the oldest of Guernsey's parish churches, standing on the coast where Samson of Dol arrived from Brittany in the sixth century, intending to convert Islanders to Christianity. The church was consecrated on 22 May 1111 by the Bishop of Coutances. St Sampson is the Patron Saint of Guernsey In 1814 there were 125 dwellings, housing 788 residents of Saint Sampson. The parish providing 1/13th of all taxes collected in Guernsey. Harbour facilities improved as trade using the harbour increased. In 1822, 7,000 tons of granite cobbles were exported in 90 ships. By 1836 annual exports had increased to 57,584 tons. In 1841 the south quay was completed and by 1851, 542 ships were using the harbour each year. By 1861 granite exports had risen to 142,866 tons on 737 ships. Today the harbour is used for non- containerised freight, including liquid and gas fuel. Shipbuilding took place in Saint Sampson, from local trading craft to a tea clipper called Golden Spur and a steamship, the Commerce built in 1874. The Lydia, a local 173 ton brig, sailed in March 1853 from Saint Sampson to Adelaide with 60 emigrants, it took 132 days. Trams used to run from Saint Sampson to Saint Peter Port from 1879, taking over from a horse-drawn bus that had started operation in 1837. Originally the trams were steam powered, changing to electric in 1891 and continuing in service until 1934. ==Features== The features of the parish include: * Saint Sampson Harbour (southern half) * Saint Sampson Church * Delancey Park * Longue Hougue quarry, in use until 1969 and now a water reservoir * Military: ** Parish war memorial inside the parish church ** Chateau des Marais, a Motte-and-bailey castle ** Guernsey loophole towers- Mont Crevelt Tower ** German fortifications, built during the occupation 1940-45 * Archaeology: ** A ruined megalith at Delancey park ** A cist in circles at Sandy Hook, L'Islet * Bays ** Grande Havre ** Port Grat ** Pulias ** Pecqueries * A number of protected buildings The parish of St. Sampson hosts: * The St. Sampson Douzaine * The island prison * The Track * The island's skate park * The Guernsey studio of Channel Television and BBC Guernsey * Numerous industrial premises and a fuel farm * Corbet Field – home of Vale Recreation F.C. * Hautes Capelles Primary School * St Mary & St Michael Catholic Primary School * St. Sampson High School * The Island Bowl * Oatlands Craft Centre * White Rock Brewery ==Politics== Prior to the States decision to introduce Island Wide Voting St Sampson comprised the whole of the St Sampson administrative division In the 2016 Guernsey general election there was a 3,509 or 78% turnout to elect six Deputies.

The affair became known by the name of the Affiche rouge (\\"Red Poster\\") because the Germans plastered Paris in the spring of 1944 with thousands of red posters denouncing those executed as immigrants and Resistants.

In June 1981, Heaven Up Here became Echo & the Bunnymen's first Top 10 release when it reached number 10 on the UK Albums Chart. It was also the band's first entry into the United States albums charts when it reached number 184 of the Billboard 200. Heaven Up Here released the singles \\"A Promise\\" and \\"Over the Wall\\". Recorded at Rockfield Studios near Monmouth in Wales, Heaven Up Here was co-produced by Hugh Jones and the band. A generally well received album by fans in the United Kingdom and by critics, Heaven Up Here won the \\"Best Dressed LP\\" and \\"Best Album\\" awards at the 1981 NME Awards. The album has also been listed at number 463 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. ==Background and recording== After the public and press interest garnered from Echo & the Bunnymen's debut album, Crocodiles, the band released the Shine So Hard EP which maintained their profile. Work then soon began on their second album, Heaven Up Here. Following musical differences between the band and Crocodiles producers Bill Drummond and David Balfe, Hugh Jones was brought in to produce Heaven Up Here.Bell, p. 4 Jones had previously engineered Crocodiles and co- produced Shine So Hard with Drummond. Jones would later go on to produce the band's 2005 album Siberia. The band were also given an additional producer credit. The album was recorded at Rockfield Studios near Monmouth in Wales during March 1981. In the liner notes to the 2003 remastered version of the album, lead singer Ian McCulloch said that he constantly had the American rock band The Velvet Underground's song \\"What Goes On\\" in the back of his mind. He also stated that the band wanted to record a soul album. In the same liner notes, bassist Les Pattinson said that the band was often lazy and hence had hired rehearsal space at the Ministry in Liverpool. He said this made them work harder and develop \\"language\\" in the rhythm.Bell, p. 5 According to guitarist Will Sergeant, McCulloch considers Heaven Up Here to be Sergeant's album because he was bossy and a control freak during the recording.Bell, p. 7 ==Music== In 1981, music magazine the NME described the album as darker and more passionate than 1980's Crocodiles. The Record Mirror also said that the band sang the blues and devoted themselves to existential sadness. They went on to note that the album offered \\"an anatomy of melancholy, resplendent with the glamour of doom\\".Adams, p. 71 Melody Maker disagreed when in 1981 they said \\"the Bunnymen are continuing to play majestic, uplifting music that will shine through the dark days ahead of us\\". In the 2002 book Turquoise Days: The Weird World of Echo & the Bunnymen, author Chris Adams said that in 1995 McCulloch had said, \\"That spikey edge [of the album] still stands up.\\"Adams, p. 72 In relation to their style of music, in 1980 McCulloch had said, \\"I always say 'We're a rock band'. Because I'm proud of that.\\" He added, \\"I like rock music [...] I prefer being good or great within that basic format [...] I just prefer basic songs.\\"Adams, p. 74 In his 2005 book Rip It Up and Start Again: Post Punk 1978–1984, British music journalist Simon Reynolds described the sound of Heaven Up Here as having been filled out with \\"guitar overdubs, keyboard glints, vocal multitracking and atmospheric vapours\\".Reynolds, pp. 440–1 Comparing Heaven Up Here with Joy Division's 1980 album Closer, Reynolds said they are \\"harrowed by the same things [...] hypocrisy, distrust, betrayal, lost or frozen potential\\". However, he said that \\"Closer shows Ian Curtis fatally mesmerized by his own dread visions, Heaven Up Here ultimately turns its face towards the light\\" with the tracks \\"No Dark Things\\" – which he describes as renouncing \\"death-wishful thinking\\" – and \\"All I Want\\" – which he describes as \\"a blasting celebration of desire for desire's sake\\" and \\"pure intransitive exhilaration\\". ==Cover== The photograph used on the front and back cover of the album was taken by photographer Brian Griffin. The picture shows the band on a wet beach in the south Wales seaside town of Porthcawl; there are dark clouds in the sky and the sun is low on the horizon causing the band to be silhouetted. The picture was taken on a day off from recording the album.Bell, p. 8 The original album's cover art was designed by Martyn Atkins. According to Griffin, they used buckets of fish offal to entice the gulls to fly into shot. He also stated that both Drummond and Rob Dickins, head of their record label Korova, hated the pictures from the shoot, and that he and Atkins had to fight for them to be used on the sleeve. The cover received the \\"Best Dressed LP\\" award in the 1981 NME Awards.Adams, p. 73 Reynolds said that the band's manager, Drummond, saw them as representing \\"cold, dampness, darkness\\".Reynolds, p. 450 The front cover picture of the original album was kept for the 2003 reissue. However, the design was altered slightly by graphic designer Rachel Gutek of the design company guppyart. The release contained an expanded booklet written by music journalist Max Bell giving the background to the album. The booklet also contains a number of photographs which are credited to Sergeant and Pattinson. ==Releases== The album was originally released as an LP by Korova in the United Kingdom on 30 May 1981. It was then released in the United States by Sire Records on 24 June 1981. It was released elsewhere on Korova although with a different catalogue number. Side one of the LP contained five tracks and side two had six. The album was first released on CD on 16 May 1988. Along with their first five albums, the album was remastered and reissued on CD in 2003 containing five bonus tracks – these releases were marketed as 25th anniversary editions. \\"Broke My Neck (Long Version)\\", which was recorded at Tistedal Studios in Norway on 7 June 1981, is the B-side of the 12-inch single \\"A Promise\\" – an edited version was used as the B-side of the 7-inch single. The other four bonus tracks were recorded live at the Manly Vale Hotel in Sydney, Australia on 11 November 1981. The reissued album was produced by music historian Andy Zax and producer Bill Inglot. The only single from Heaven Up Here released worldwide was \\"A Promise\\" on 10 July 1981. The single stayed on the UK Singles Chart for four weeks and reached number 49. Later that year, \\"Over the Wall\\" was released as a single in Australia only. ==Reception== Heaven Up Here was generally well received by the music press and critics. In a 1982 interview with the band for the NME, rock journalist Barney Hoskins described the album as \\"one of the most superior articulations of 'rock' form in living memory.\\" Later reviews have continued to receive the album well: Allmusic reviewer Aaron Warshaw said that McCulloch \\"sings with soaring abandon and passion throughout the album\\" and that Sergeant's guitar playing was at its \\"angular finest\\". Not all reviews were positive: Robert Christgau, giving the album a C rating, said that he held \\"no brief against tuneless caterwaul, but tuneless psychedelic caterwaul has always been another matter.\\" In his 1999 book From the Shores of Lake Placid and Other Stories, the band's manager Bill Drummond said \\"The album is dull as ditchwater. The songs are unformed, the sound uniformly grey.\\" Heaven Up Here sold well in the United Kingdom, staying on the UK Albums Chart for a total of 16 weeks and reaching a peak of number 10 in June 1981. The album was the first release by Echo & the Bunnymen to make it onto the American charts when it reached number 184 on the Billboard 200. In 2012, the album ranked number 463 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The NME has ranked the album number 39 in its list of the 50 greatest albums of the '80s and number 51 in its list of the greatest albums of all time. The album also received the NME's 1981 best album award.

The tree is found in small, scattered populations, and not in large forests of its species. Hesperocyparis goveniana occurs with Hesperocyparis macrocarpa (Monterey cypress), in the two groves where the Monterey cypress occurs naturally, in Monterey County. It is on the IUCN Red List of endangered species. ==Description== Hesperocyparis goveniana is an evergreen tree with a conic to ovoid-conic crown, very variable in size, with mature trees of under on some sites, to tall in ideal conditions. The foliage grows in dense sprays, dark green to somewhat yellow-green in color. The leaves are scale-like, long, and produced on rounded (not flattened) shoots. The seed cones are globose to oblong, long, with 6 to 10 scales, green at first, maturing brown or gray-brown about 20–24 months after pollination. The cones remain closed for many years, only opening after the parent tree is killed in a wildfire, thereby allowing the seeds to colonize the bare ground exposed by the fire.

He was educated at St. Aloysius' College, Glasgow, Mount St Mary's College near Sheffield, and the University of Glasgow. He was admitted as an advocate in 1932. He served in the Royal Artillery and the Judge Advocate Generals' Branch during World War II. As an advocate, he appeared before the Court of Session in his military uniform. As a young man he played football for Shettleston F.C. He was an unsuccessful parliamentary candidate for Bute and North Ayrshire in 1945 and for Glasgow Bridgeton in 1946, where he was defeated by the Independent Labour Party candidate. He was elected for Edinburgh East at a by-election in November 1947 and sat for the constituency until 1954. During his time in the Commons, he never made a Maiden Speech. He was Solicitor General for Scotland from March to October 1947, when he was appointed Lord Advocate. He was appointed a King's Counsel (KC) and a Privy Counsellor (PC) in 1947. One of his most significant achievements as a politician was the establishment of the legal aid scheme in Scotland. He was appointed to the bench, with the judicial title \\"Lord Wheatley\\". In 1966 he was appointed chairman of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Scotland. The resulting \\"Wheatley Report\\", published in 1969, led to the eventual introduction a new system of Scottish local authorities. On 28 July 1970 he was created a life peer, as Baron Wheatley, of Shettleston in the County of the City of Glasgow. In December 1972 he was appointed to succeed Lord Grant as Lord Justice Clerk, a post he held until 1985. Following the Ibrox disaster in 1971, Wheatley was appointed by the government to conduct an inquiry into safety at sports grounds. His 1972 report became the basis for the Green Guide. Wheatley was a lifelong Roman Catholic. He was also known for hard sentencing of crimes involving sex. While Lord Justice-Clerk (an appeal judge), he exercised his right to sit as a trial judge in criminal cases, and handed out long sentences for such crimes. ==Posthumous== It was Wheatley's memorial service in 1988 which was attended by his old friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern, at the time Lord Chancellor. As a member of the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland, which strongly disapproves of Roman Catholicism, Mackay was disciplined by his church for having attended the memorial service. ==Family== His uncle was the Shettleston MP John Wheatley. Wheatley's son-in-law was the late Tam Dalyell, former father of the House of Commons, who married Wheatley's daughter, Kathleen, in 1963. ==References== * ==External links== * Category:1908 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Politicians from Glasgow Category:Place of death missing Category:Solicitors General for Scotland Wheatley Category:Scottish Roman Catholics Category:Royal Artillery officers Category:Alumni of the University of Glasgow Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Life peers Category:Scottish Labour Party MPs Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Edinburgh constituencies Category:UK MPs 1945–1950 Category:UK MPs 1950–1951 Category:UK MPs 1951–1955 Category:UK MPs who were granted peerages Category:British Army personnel of World War II Category:People educated at St Aloysius' College, Glasgow Category:Lord Advocates Category:Scottish Queen's Counsel Category:Queen's Counsel 1901–2000 Category:Ministers in the Attlee governments, 1945–1951 ","title":"John Wheatley, Baron Wheatley"},{"id":"2233534","text":"54-40 is an eponymous album by Canadian alternative rock band 54-40.

He is the Lucius Moody Bristol Distinguished Professor of Religion and Professor of History, and Distinguished Research Professor at Florida State University (FSU). He is a leader in the academic study of religion and emotion and in the field of the spatial humanities. His narrative histories of religion in America are widely adopted in university courses. ==Biography== Corrigan was born in Chicago, Illinois in October, 1952. He studied English Romantic poetry as a college undergraduate, writing a thesis on the poetry of William Blake. Following his graduation in 1972 he resided in different parts of the U.S. and was employed at various times as a cab driver, cook, tree surgeon, in a textile mill, on a farm, at a zoo, and in an office, eventually returning to Chicago where he worked as a union bricklayer. He undertook doctoral work in American religious history at the University of Chicago, defending with distinction a Ph.D. dissertation about the Revolutionary era in 1982. Corrigan subsequently held academic posts at the University of Virginia, Harvard University, Arizona State University, Oxford University, University of London, University of Halle-Wittenberg, Columbia University, and University College (Dublin), and as a visiting scholar at the American Academy in Rome, Research Associate at the American Antiquarian Society, and the Fulbright Distinguished Research Chair for the Netherlands. He joined the religion and history departments at Florida State University in 2001, where he also was the founding director of the Institute for the Study of Emotion. Corrigan was coeditor of the journal Church History: Studies in Christianity and Culture (Cambridge University Press) from 2003-2016. He is editor of the Chicago History of American Religion, a book series published by the University of Chicago Press, and co-editor of The Spatial Humanities, a book series published by Indiana University Press. ==Scholarship== Corrigan's contributions to scholarship are in three overlapping areas: American religious history, religion and emotion, and the spatial humanities. ===American religious history=== Corrigan has written books that collectively address the sweep of American religious history from the colonial period to the present. Those books take emotion to be a central part of religious life and analyze it historically. The Hidden Balance (1987) argued that certain key eighteenth-century American religious thinkers and social theorists understood thinking and feeling to be conjoined in religious life just as they were in social and political life. The Prism of Piety (1991) proposed that understandings of emotion as a physical experience were central to the religious lives of colonial New Englanders. In Business of the Heart (2002) Corrigan evidenced the way in which emotion was imagined as a commodity in the nineteenth century, exchanged between individuals according to feeling rules, and conceptualized as both affective capital and a medium of trade between persons and a Protestant God. Emptiness: Feeling Christian in America (2015) tracked the deliberate Christian cultivation of the feeling of emptiness throughout American history and the social divisions related to that. The topic of emotion is prominent in his textbook Religion in America. Corrigan's study of emotion led him to the specific feeling of hatred. His books on religious intolerance directly address the problem of religious hatred and how historically it has issued in violence. Religious Intolerance in America (co- authored with Lynn Neal, 2010), and Religious Intolerance, America, and the World (2020) analyze the history of religious intolerance in America, sometimes with an eye to broader global developments, and in relation to feeling as a central aspect of religiously-inspired violence. The Emotional Practice of Religious Intolerance (2020) draws upon emotions theory to illustrate how intolerance develops historically. ===The study of religion and emotion=== Corrigan has claimed that the historical and critical study of emotion is crucial to the advancement of the academic field of religious studies. He contends that a residual parochialism in the field, which equated something thought to be mysterious about religion with something thought to be equally mysterious about emotion, framed emotion as an irreducible datum and discouraged analytical and scientific approaches to its study. His approach combines the history of emotions with insights drawn from philosophy, anthropology, psychology, and brain science. He has advised that scholars must take care to avoid creating a highly specialized and technical \\"secret language\\" to talk about emotion if progress is to be made investigating it alongside religion. He has maintained that the most promising approach is through interdisciplinary collaborations. Religion and Emotion: Approaches and Interpretations (2004), The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Emotion (2006), and Feeling Religion (2018) are efforts to bring a wide field of disciplinary perspectives and voices to the study of religion and emotion. ===Spatial humanities=== The term \\"spatial humanities,\\" which has been globally adopted, was coined by Corrigan, David Bodenhamer, and Trevor Harris at an expert workshop at the Polis Center in 2008. It identifies a collaboration between humanities scholars and other researchers, and especially the ways in which scholarship that exploits digitally-enabled representations of space (through GIS and media software) can help to bridge the epistemological divide between the humanities and the sciences. Corrigan and others have proposed that the \\"deep map,\\" a detailed, multilayered, fluid, and polyvocal representation of space that blends quantitative and qualitative data, is a promising tool for the study of culture. That idea, outlined in Deep Maps (2015), informs parts of the multi-volume Oxford Encyclopedia of Religion in America (2018), one- fifth of which is dedicated to the topic of religion and space. ==Reception== Corrigan's focus on religion, emotion, space, and power amounts to what the London Times Literary Supplement characterized as an effort to demonstrate how religion seeks to \\"mediate a comprehensive map of the world.\\" It is a history that offers \\"a complex account of group identity and boundary-making.\\" While Corrigan has \\"explicitly brought emotions and religion under the analytical microscope,\\" and for that has been called \\"our doyen of the study of religion and emotion,\\" his research has been criticized as more history of emotions than history of religion and for overestimating forms of social control, including the power of emotional scripts. ==Recognition== Corrigan has been awarded fellowships for professors from the National Endowment for the Humanities, National Humanities Center, Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, American Council of Learned Societies, and the Fulbright program. In 2017 he was designated Alumnus of the Year of the University of Chicago Divinity School. In 2016 he was named the Director of the Jessie Ball du Pont Faculty Seminar at the National Humanities Center. ==Books== The Hidden Balance: Religion and the Social Theories of Charles Chauncy and Jonathan Mayhew (Cambridge University Press, 1987; paperback, 2006) The Prism of Piety: Catholick Congregationalist Clergy at the Beginning of the Enlightenment (Oxford University Press, 1991) Religion in America: An Historical Account of the Development of American Religious Life, 5th (revised) ed., co-author with Winthrop Hudson, (Macmillan, 1992) Jews, Christians, Muslims: A Comparative Introduction to Monotheistic Religions, general editor and co-author with Carlos M.

OCB mode was designed by Phillip Rogaway, who credits Mihir Bellare, John Black, and Ted Krovetz with assistance and comments on the designs. It is based on the integrity-aware parallelizeable mode (IAPM) of authenticated encryption by Charanjit S. Jutla. The OCB2 version was proven insecure, while the original OCB1 as well as OCB3 from 2011 are still considered secure. ==Encryption and authentication== OCB mode was designed to provide both message authentication and privacy. It is essentially a scheme for integrating a message authentication code (MAC) into the operation of a block cipher. In this way, OCB mode avoids the need to use two systems: a MAC for authentication and encryption for privacy. This results in lower computational cost compared to using separate encryption and authentication functions. There are three versions of OCB: OCB1, OCB2 and OCB3. OCB1 was published in 2001. OCB2 improves on OCB1 by allowing associated data to be included with the message, providing authenticated encryption with associated date (AEAD; that is, data that are not encrypted but should be authenticated) and a new method for generating a sequence of offsets. OCB2 was first published in 2003, originally named authenticated-encryption mode, or advanced encryption mode (AEM) and was shown to be completely insecure in 2019. OCB3, published in 2011, changes again the way offsets are computed and introduces minor performance improvements. OCB mode is listed as an optional method in the IEEE802.11 wireless security standard as an alternative to counter with CBC-MAC mode (CCM). OCB2 is standardized in ISO/IEC19772:2009 and a modified OCB3 in RFC7253. The RFC encodes the tag length into the internally formatted nonce. ==Performance== OCB performance overhead is minimal compared to classical, non-authenticating modes like cipher block chaining. OCB requires one block cipher operation per block of encrypted and authenticated message, and one block cipher operation per block of associated data. There is also one extra block cipher operation required at the end of process. For comparison, CCM mode offering similar functionality requires twice as many block cipher operations per message block (associated data requires one, as in OCB). ==Patents== Two U.S. patents have been issued for OCB mode. However, a special exemption is granted allowing OCB mode to be used in software licensed under the GNU General Public License without cost, as well as for any non- commercial, non-governmental application. This constraint has hindered approval by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/computer-security-objects- register/algorithm-registration#AES Since the authors have only applied for patent protection in the U.S., the algorithm is free to use in software not developed and not sold inside the U.S. By January 2013, the author has granted a free license for any open source license certified by the Open Source Initiative. ==Attacks== Niels Ferguson pointed out collision attacks on OCB, which limits the amount of data that can be securely processed under a single key to about 280 terabytes. In October 2018, Inoue and Minematsu presented an existential forgery attack against OCB2 that requires only a single prior encryption query and almost no computational power or storage. The attack does not extend to OCB1 or OCB3, and it requires that the associated data field of the forged ciphertext be empty. Poettering and Iwata improved the forgery attack to a full plaintext recovery attack just a couple of days later. The four authors later produced a joint report. ==See also== * CCM mode * CWC mode * EAX mode * Galois/counter mode * PCFB mode * XCBC mode == References == * ==External links== * OCB homepage * OCB FAQ * NIST: Modes Development Category:Block cipher modes of operation Category:Authenticated-encryption schemes ","title":"OCB mode"},{"id":"2233562","text":"Continental Airlines Flight 1713 was a commercial airline flight that crashed while taking off in a snowstorm from Stapleton International Airport in Denver, Colorado on The Douglas DC-9 airliner, operated by Continental Airlines, was making a scheduled flight to Boise, Idaho. Twenty-five passengers and three crew members died in the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation of the accident determined that the most probable cause of the accident was the failure, on the part of the pilot in command, to have the aircraft deiced a second time before take- off. == Background information  Aircraft === Flight 1713 was operated using a 21-year old McDonnell Douglas DC-9-14, a twin-engine, narrow-body jet airliner with the registration number N626TX.

He had 3,186 flight hours, but only 36 of those hours were on the DC-9, which was the extent of his turbojet experience, and he had not flown at all for the past 24 days. Bruecher was the pilot flying at the time of the accident. The cabin crew consisted of three flight attendants. === Weather === At the time of the accident on Sunday afternoon, the National Weather Service was reporting moderate wet snow at Stapleton International Airport. The heaviest snowfall rate occurred between 13:10 and 14:20 MST, with the peak snowfall rate occurring around 13:50. == Accident == A Continental DC-9-14, similar to the one involved in the accident Continental Airlines Flight 1713 was scheduled to depart Denver at 12:25, but many flights out of Denver that day were delayed by the inclement weather. At 13:03, Flight 1713 taxied from its gate to the de-icing pad; unfortunately, air traffic controllers were not aware that Flight 1713 had departed the gate because the flight crew had done so without first requesting taxi clearance. De-icing was completed at 13:46. At 13:51, Flight 1713 contacted the clearance delivery controller for permission to \\"taxi from the ice pad.\\" The clearance delivery controller, believing that Flight 1713 was still at the gate and requesting to proceed to de-icing, instructed the flight to switch to ground controller frequency. At 14:05, Flight 1713 was lined up on the number one position at the north end of the runway, and the crew was ready for take off. Not kept properly informed of Flight 1713’s position, the air traffic controllers tried repeatedly to have different planes take off, leaving Flight 1713 standing in the falling snow for several minutes and opening the airliner to the risk of \\"wing contamination\\" by ice. Flight 1713 then notified air traffic controllers that they were holding at the start of the runway and awaiting takeoff instructions. Flight 1713 wreckage Flight 1713 was cleared for takeoff at 14:14. As the DC-9 was taking off, the pilot in control over-rotated; the DC-9 descended and the left wing struck the ground, causing the wing to separate. A fuel-fed flash fire ignited in the left wing shortly after it struck the ground, causing a \\"fireball\\" inside the cabin. The left side of the DC-9 and cockpit struck the ground next and the DC-9 continued rolling, inverted. As the DC-9 skidded, the left side was tilted over and the tail was inverted; this action caused the middle part of the DC-9 to compress and crush many of the passengers on board. A total of 25 passengers and 3 crew members died due to the crash; the final two fatalities succumbed while hospitalized. The captain, the first officer, one flight attendant, and 11 of the passengers died from blunt trauma. In addition, 5 passengers died of head injuries secondary to blunt trauma, and 9 passengers died of asphyxia. The remaining 52 passengers and 2 flight attendants survived. Of the surviving passengers, 25 received minor injuries and 27 received serious injuries. Fitzsimons Army Medical Center sent its personnel to assist in the triage of passengers, and ten hospitals treated the survivors. == Investigation == The seating chart of Continental Airlines Flight 1713, based on the official NTSB report. The chart illustrates locations of passengers, lack of injuries, severities of injuries, and causes of deaths, all where applicable. The NTSB investigated the accident. In July 1988, Continental Airlines filed a report with the NTSB positing the causes of the crash as wake turbulence, poor snow plowing on the runway and errors by air traffic controllers. However, the NTSB investigated the wake-turbulence theory and concluded that wake turbulence from the preceding flight would not have affected Flight 1713. During the investigation, the crew's low levels of experience on the DC-9 were brought into question. Investigators also discovered that before he began working for Continental, Bruecher had been dismissed from another airline after failing on three occasions to pass a flight exam. Investigators likewise determined that First Officer Bruecher was at the controls at the time of the accident. Investigators determined that 27 minutes elapsed between the conclusion of de- icing and Flight 1713's attempt to take off, seven minutes longer than should have been allowed to elapse before takeoff. The NTSB concluded that a build-up of ice on the wings of Flight 1713 had contaminated the surfaces of both of the wings prior to departure, based on reports from surviving passengers that they had seen \\"patches\\" of ice on the wings after deicing was complete. Investigators also concluded that enough wet snow landed on Flight 1713 after deicing was complete to melt and dilute the deicing fluid, which allowed ice to reform on the wings. According to the aircraft's manufacturer, even a modest amount of ice contamination on the upper wing could impair the lifting performance of the wings and lead to loss of roll and pitch control. Based on this, the NTSB concluded that a small amount of ice on the wings had caused Flight 1713 to have significant controllability problems. The NTSB also determined that First Officer Bruecher's poor performance during takeoff had likely contributed to his loss of control of the airplane. The first officer rotated the airplane at more than 6 degrees per second, or twice the recommended rate. Combined with the effects of ice on the wing, the high climb rate caused the plane's left wing to stall and the plane to begin rolling over. Flight 1713 was Bruecher's first flight after a 24-day absence from flight duties, and the NTSB concluded that this prolonged absence had eroded the newly hired first officer's retention of his recent training, which contributed to his poor takeoff performance. On September 27, 1988, the NTSB published a final report on its investigation into the crash, attributing the accident to the captain's failure to have the plane de-iced a second time, the first officer's poor takeoff performance, confusion between the pilots and air traffic controllers which contributed to delays, compounded by a cockpit crew where both pilots were relatively inexperienced on the aircraft type. Specifically, the NTSB concluded: == Aftermath == After the crash, Continental Airlines reiterated its procedures for handling deicing and developed a computerized assignment program that would prevent “green-on-green” crewing, or keep pilots with less than 100 hours flying time in type from being assigned to the same flight. Nine months after the crash of Flight 1713, Delta Air Lines Flight 1141 crashed in Dallas. When the NTSB released its report on Flight 1713, it specifically mentioned the fact that \\"almost 3 minutes of nonpertinent social conversation\\" had occurred before take-off. When the NTSB later issued its report on Delta 1141, it found that the Delta crew had also engaged in nonpertinent conversation, including a discussion of the cockpit voice recorder from the crash of Continental 1713.http://www.aviationexplorer.com/audio/delta_1141.wav Cockpit Voice Recording from Delta Air Lines Flight 1141 The report on Delta 1141 concluded, amongst other causes, that the Dallas crash's most probable cause was that crew’s nonpertinent conversation, or failure to maintain a “sterile cockpit,” having contributed to their failure to extend that aircraft's flaps and slats to proper take-off configuration. Stapleton was replaced by Denver International Airport in 1995; it has since been decommissioned and the property redeveloped as a retail and residential neighborhood. Continental merged with UAL Corporation (the parent company of United Airlines) via a stock swap in 2010, and the integration was completed in 2012\\\\. == In popular culture == Continental Airlines Flight 1713 was mentioned in the 1988 film Rain Man. The crash was the subject of episode 10, season 18 of Mayday, titled “Dead of Winter.” In February of 1990, Reader's Digest Magazine detailed the flight crew and some of the passengers in its article “Miracle In The Blizzard.” == See also == * Air Ontario Flight 1363 * USAir Flight 405 == References == == External links == *The haunting memories of Continental 1713, editorial by a former Continental passenger service agent *Carolyn Holly reports on 1987 Denver-Boise crash, original video news broadcast of crash in 1987. *Pre-crash photos of the airliner at airliners.net Category:Airliner accidents and incidents in Colorado Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by ice Category:1987 meteorology Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the United States in 1987 Category:1987 in Colorado 1713 Category:History of Denver Category:Accidents and incidents involving the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 Category:November 1987 events in the United States ","title":"Continental Airlines Flight 1713"},{"id":"2233569","text":"\\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\\" is a single taken from Radiohead's first album Pablo Honey, released just in advance of the album.

Maclean found the records in his uncle's (also named John Maclean, Jr.) paperwork, who happened to be president of the college at that time. Maclean joined with students Charles Smith DeGraw and Gustavus W. Mayer to form a new Chi Phi Fraternity that was based on some records of the original society but also with many characteristics that differed from the original society. While the Chi Phi Fraternity of today was actually founded in 1854, the members place great emphasis on the 1824 date because of many aspects that were carried over from the original records discovered in 1854. The names of the founders of the original society of 1824 were not even known to the 1854 founders; however, they were later discovered and published in the book \\"Princeton\\" by V.L. Collins in 1914. The Chi Phi Fraternity founded by Maclean was also short-lived. The group existed sub rosa only until 1859 when it was abandoned completely. However, before the Princeton chapter died off, it was able to successfully establish a second chapter at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania in 1854. The chapter at Franklin and Marshall in turn planted a chapter at Gettysburg College in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities 1920. p 116Greek Letter Men of Albany. 1901. p 15.Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities. 1912. p 94 ===The Southern Order=== The second Chi Phi Fraternity was founded at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on August 21, 1858 by five undergraduate students. The Chi Phi Fraternity of the South was also the second exclusively southern Fraternity established prior to the Civil War and was very successful in planting six chapters prior to the outbreak of hostilities and nine afterwards, but prior to the merger with the Northern Order. All but the UNC chapter suspended operations as a result of the Civil War.Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities 1920. p 117 Southern Order Founders * Rev. Augustus Moore Flythe - Class of 1859 - Episcopal Deacon and Missionary, New Bern, North Carolina * Capt. Thomas Capehart, CSA - Class of 1861 - Beginning in April 1861, served as a lieutenant in the Bethel Regiment, 1st North Carolina Volunteers (Infantry), commanded by Col. D.H. Hill, afterwards a General in the CSA. In early 1862, he then became the captain of Co. C, 3rd Battalion North Carolina Light Artillery. After the Seven Days fight, this organization disbanded on account of scarcity of horses and equipment and he was commissioned as a captain in Wynn's Cavalry (15th) Battalion, organized for State defense remaining as such until the surrender. He lived the remainder of his life as a wealthy planter in Vance Co., N.C. near the village of Kittrell, where the home he built in 1867 still stands and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. * John Calhoun Tucker - Class of 1861 - Served as Private in Co. I (Burt Avengers raised in Hinds Co.), 39th Mississippi Infantry and died in service on December 28, 1862 near Port Hudson, Louisiana at the age of 23. At the surrender, only seven of his company were reported in service. * William Harrison Greene - Class of 1862 - Served as a lieutenant in Co. G, 5th Alabama Infantry Regiment assigned to the Rodes Brigade and the Army of Northern Virginia throughout the War. He was wounded in the leg at Sharpsburg, Antietam, Maryland in September 1862. He later became a gentleman farmer at Wayside, Mississippi. * Fletcher Terry Seymour, M.D. - Class of 1862 - Served as a private in the 6th Tennessee Infantry in 1862. He was honorably discharged on account of ill health and became a merchant and planter at Eurekaton, Tenn. ===Secret Order of Chi Phi=== On November 14, 1860, the third independent fraternity to be named Chi Phi was founded at Hobart College, Geneva by twelve men who took the initiatory oath and received a badge. The twelve men later became known throughout Chi Phi as the \\"Twelve Apostles\\". The fraternity was officially known as the \\"Secret Order of Chi Phi\\" and the first chapter would be called the Upsilon chapter. The Secret Order of Chi Phi at Hobart planted four additional chapters, and then in 1865, negotiations began regarding a merger with the Princeton Order. Negotiations were completed on May 29, 1867, and chapters from both groups united as the Northern Order.

At the meeting, three members from each order adopted a constitution and by-laws and established a date for the first convention, which was held in Washington, DC on July 23, 1874.Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities 1920. p 117-118Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities. 1912. p 96Greek Letter Men of Albany. 1901. p 224 ===Growth and development=== In June 1867, due to the disruption of the American Civil War, a group of Southern students led by Peter Mitchell Wilson, A-A '69 and other students from the States of Louisiana and South Carolina, chartered the Theta Chapter of the Southern Order at the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland. This Chapter is thought to be the first international and only European Chapter of an American College Fraternity. Except for a brief period in 1911, three Chi Phis (Joseph Mackey Brown, John Marshall Slaton and Nathaniel E. Harris) held the office of governor in the State of Georgia from 1909 to 1917. Brown was vehemently opposed to Slaton's pardon of Leo Frank in 1915 and since his death in 1932, Brown has been implicated as a conspirator in Frank's lynching. Chi Phi's conservative expansion philosophy that only the old, well established schools were suitable for a Chapter led to the denial of a petition for a charter by a group of students at the University of Richmond in 1901. This group went on to found the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. During the subsequent fifty-three year period, Sigma Phi Epsilon chartered over 140 Chapters, while Chi Phi only chartered 14. == Chapters == ==Notable members== A man named Jerry Reid, who returned to college in a new major at the age of 68 and subsequently pledged Chi Phi, is possibly the oldest new member ever thus far to join a college fraternity.HuffPost, 2013.

Their self designation is Шор, or Shor. They were also called Kuznetskie Tatars (кузнецкие татары), Kondoma Tatars (кондомские татары), Mras-Su Tatars (мрасские татары) in some of the documents of the 17th and 18th centuries. Most Shors live in the Tom basin along the Kondoma and Mras-Su Rivers. This region is historically called Mountainous Shoria. The Shors also live in Khakassia and Altai Republic. According to 2002 census, there were 13,975 Shors in Russia (12,601 in 1926, 16,042 in 1939, 14,938 in 1959, 15,950 in 1970, 15,182 in 1979 and 15,745 in 1989). The Shors speak their own Shor language. == History  Early history === The Shors as a people formed as a result of a long process of intermixing between the Turkic, Ugrian, Samoyedic and Ket-speaking tribes.Akiner (1986), p. 417 Their culture and origins are similar to those of the northern Altay people and some of the ethnic groups of the Khakas. The region where the Shors currently reside was Turkicized under the influence of the Yenisei Kirghiz during the medieval period. The Shors resulted from this ethnic mixing and adopted Turkic speech (the Shor language) as a result.Forsyth (1992), p. 23-24 Shor tribes began to become a distinct people around the 8th and 9th centuries AD. The Mongol conquest of the Altai-Sayan region in the 13th century added another layer of cultural influence over the local population and their languages. The region subsequently fell under the influence of the Oirats from the late 14th century to the early 17th century. Although Mongol control of the area was nominal, many of the languages (including Shor) contains significant amounts of Mongol loanwords. The Shors were a valuable asset to the Yenisei Kirghiz and Oirats as suppliers of ironware. Their ability to smelt iron from ore was a feat that only one other indigenous Siberian people (the Yakuts) were able to do before the Russian advance to the area.Forsyth (1992), p. 56, 183 === Early modern history === In the early 17th century, the Shors and their territory were conquered by the Russians. In the 18th century, Russian settlers began to move in to the area. The Shors' niche as producers of ironware for the Oirats, Altaians, and Kirghiz was soon eroded by the Russian traders. The Russians had more advanced products to offer and this ended Shor blacksmithing. Atop of this, Russian officials subjected the Shors to pay yasak in the form of furs. This resulted in most Shors abandoning their old occupations and villages to move to nearby towns so they can make a better living as hunters. However, they lived in squalid conditions. The use of nettle-fibre or wild hemp for clothing, primitive implements, and techniques continued on towards the 20th century.Forsyth (1992), p. 183 === Modern history === The Shors were little affected by the Russian Revolution and its civil war until the Bolsheviks took the region in 1920. In 1929, the Shor National Region was formed but was quickly dissolved in 1939.Mote (1998), p. 138. \\"In the decade between 1929 and 1939, the neighboring Shors had their own national okrug...\\"Akiner (1986), p. 417. \\"The Shor National Region was formed in 1929, but disbanded in 1939.\\" The okrug (district) was disbanded because the Soviet authorities believed its existence might hinder the development of the iron and coal industries in the region.Mote (1998), p. 138 These minerals became important to the state after deposits were discovered in the Kuznetsk Basin in the 1930s. This discovery led to a new wave of Russian settlers and workers to the region and began displacing the Shors.Forsyth (1992), p. 300-301 The authorities considered the Shors to be numerically insignificant and that disenfranchising them would not be consequential to the state. The Shors greatly suffered as a result. They were driven out of their farms and villages and forced to work in the coal mines. The population of the Shors declined and the urban Shors struggled with alcoholism, drug addiction, suicide, and high lethal accident rates.Mote (1998), p. 151 Traditional Shor culture began to wane . The liberalization of Soviet rule beginning in the 1980s led to a Shor cultural revival and the establishment of many cultural and linguistic institutions (like the creation of The Association of Shor People in the 1990s).K. David Harrison. Shors. (PDF). Swarthmore College. 2002. The current situation of the Shors is not free of issues however. Many Shors do not know their native language and show indifference to their traditional culture. Illness, discrimination, environmental racism, high death rates but low birth rates, drug and alcohol addiction, and the possibility of the Shors being swallowed up by the dominant Russian culture in the near future are other issues the modern Shors face. == Religion  Christianity === The Shors were originally practitioners of shamanism and animism but were converted to Russian Orthodox Christianity during Russian rule since the early 17th century. Conversions occurred rapidly after the establishment of the Altai Spiritual Mission in the 1830s.Arbachakov (2008), p. 8 Most present Shors are Russian Orthodox Christians. === Shamanism === Despite the conversion of Christianity among the Shors, shamanism has had and still is very important and influential to modern Shor spirituality. Shor Shamanism and its kam (shamans) have suffered persecution since Russian colonization of the region especially from the 17th to 20th centuries. The establishment of the Altai Spiritual Mission in the region resulted in the severe persecution of shamanism and the kam. Christian missionaries routinely lambasted Shor shamanism as being a dark cult and the kam as servants of the devil. There was many forced conversions to Christianity as well. During the soviet era, the authorities frequently designated the kam and others as enemies of the state and sentenced them to camps or even death. Graves, drums, ritual clothing, and more were burned or desecrated during this period. Shor shamanism saw a revival starting in the late 1980s and is considered a vital part of modern Shor identity. == Culture Economy=== The Shors were mainly engaged in hunting, fishing, some primitive farming, and pine nut picking. Blacksmithing and iron ore mining and melting were also important (hence, the name \\"Blacksmithing Tatars\\"). The lifestyle of the Shors changed significantly following the October Revolution of 1917. Most became farmers, cattle-breeders, or industrial workers. ===Family and clan structure=== The Shors were able to retain much of their ancient clan structure over the years. Each clan was traditionally led by a chief. Chiefs were elected in large clan gatherings. At such gatherings important decisions, conflicts, and other issues were settled. Features of their society included matrilocal marriages, exogamy, a classisfactory system of kinship terms, and the belief in certain taboos that revolve around the former. Clans routinely organized communal hunts and shared the spoils equally among themselves. However, this clan system eroded beginning in the mid-nineteenth century under the Russian influence of separating families into individual units. A family now relied on a money economy and this soon resulted in wealth disparity and differentiation in Shor society. === Environment === Environmental activist Alexander Arbachakov won a Whitley Award for his work preserving sustainable communities in Shor territory.Whitley Award winners The coal, iron, gold, and timber resources of the region are extracted by companies that show little regard to the Shors and the environment of the area. The Shors receive no direct financial benefits for the extraction of these minerals on their land. This has made some Shor feel ignored as minerals are often taken from places the Shors consider sacred. === Music === Throat-singing is an ancient and traditional form of music in Shor culture. Epic stories about heroes and deities are popular and often accompanied by singing and the use of a kai- komus (two-stringed wooden instrument). === Education === The first educational institution for the Shors was a missionary school that was established in the village of Kuzedevo around 1860. After 1867, the most talented graduates had the chance to continue their education at the College of Catechism in Kazan. However, the literacy rates of the Shors remained very low. The Soviet administration opened ten schools and a children's home in 1921–22 in the village of Kabyrza. Within ten years, the number of schools in the region increased. Libraries and clubs were opened to abolish illiteracy. By 1932, a college to train teachers had 300 students including 70 native Shor speakers. By 1936, 114 schools (100 primary and 14 secondary) existed in the area. The use of Shor in the 1920s and the rising educational standards of the Shors led to an intellectual growth of the people, including skilled artisans teachers, and those with medical and technical qualifications. Shor writers, journalists and clerks became prominent in what had previously been a largely illiterate society for the first time. Shor intellectual culture began to decline after the dissolution of the Shor National Region in 1939 and the removal of Shor as a language of instruction in schools in 1943. The teacher's college was closed while Shor intellectuals were repressed or killed fighting in the Great Patriotic War. The post-war period proved stagnant for Shor intellectual culture. The resurgence of the Shor identity beginning in the 1980s has led to a revival in traditional Shor culture and the establishment of new educational programs for native teachers, students, and the younger generation. == Shor mythology  Creation myth === The universe was originally empty until the god Ul'gen created the three skies. He placed his son Paktan in the lowest sky. He then placed a spirit called Keikush in the middle sky while he and his wife Chaasin lived in the upper sky. Ul'gen's younger brother, Erlik, decided to create things himself. Erlik created the mountains, birds, and other animals. Meanwhile, Ul'gen created man but didn't know to make human souls and as a result the man he created was nothing more than a lifeless husk. He then set out on a journey in search of a soul and left a hairless dog to protect man in his absence. Erlik saw his chance and made his way to the man. The dog refused to let him pass but Erlik made a deal with the dog. If the dog lets him pass, he'll give him fur. Erlik passed and the dog's body grew fur. Erlik proceeded towards the lifeless man, spat on him, rubbed dirt on him, and left.Arbachkov (2008), p. 14-15 Ul'gen returned with his aim failed and saw the condition of the man and dog. The dog revealed what happened and Ul'gen wondered whether Erlik knew how to create souls. He summoned Erlik and he replied that he knew how to create souls. With no other options, Ul'gen agreed that Erlik would create the soul of man if he can have their souls. However, the body of man would belong to Ul'gen. Erlik used a tube made out of a hollow angelica stem and placed the tube in man's mouth. Erlik blew the soul through the tube and into man's body. Ul'gen soon wanted to banish Erlik from Earth but Erlik pleaded to Ul'gen to give him a corner of land for him to live in. Ul'gen raised his staff and a hole opened up where it was resting. Snakes, insects, and other creatures crawled out onto the Earth and Erlik climbed down the hole to the underworld. === The worldview of the Shors === The Shors traditionally believed that the universe was divided into three levels which were:Arbachakov (2008), p. 12 * The Heavenly Realm (Ul'gen Cheri): Realm of the god Ul'gen. This world is further divided into nine \\"skies\\" (see below for more information). * The Middle Earth (Ortinda or Pistin Cheri): Our physical world. Said to be flat with the Pistag (or Mustag) Mountain lying at its center. * The Underworld (Aina Cheri): Realm of the god Erlik and his minions. All these realms were said to be populated by spirits, humans, animals, and other creatures. The three worlds were linked via the axis of the World Tree or Mountain. The top of the World Tree housed the Heavenly Realm whilst its trunk passed through the Middle Earth and its roots reached down to the Underworld. The World Mountain was divided similarly with its peak connected to the Upper World and the foot of the mountain to the Earth.Arbachakov (2008), p. 11  Divisions of the Heavenly Realm  The Heavenly realm is further divided into nine \\"skies\\". By ascending order these include:Arbachakov (2008), p. 12-14 # The Yellow Sky (keshkan): Realm of lightning. # The Blue Belt (kok kur): Realm of the blue portion of the rainbow. # The Red Belt (kizil kur): Realm of the red part of the rainbow. # The Grey Belt (kir kur): Realm of the Grey portion of the rainbow. # The Indigo Belt (kektamosh-kur): Realm of the \\"blue\\" (indigo) part of the rainbow. # The Red Sky (kizil tegri): Realm where the mysterious \\"red women\\" are said to live. # Realm of the moon and stars. # Realm of the sun. # Personal realm of Ul'gen. This realm is always lit, warm, and full of life. Vegetation never dies and there's always a plethora of cattle and animals. It's also described as a place where the bodies of the dead never decay. ===Spirits and deities=== Traditional Shor mythology boasts a range of deities and spirits. Some of these include: *Ul'gen: The god of the Heavenly Realm. Ul'gen is able to grant people anything when addressed through the kamlanie (shamanic ritual).Arbachakov (2008), p. 14 *Chaashin (or Solton): Ul'gen's wife. *Paktan: Ul'gen's son. *Erlik: The god of the underworld. * Aina: Sinister spirits that dwelled in the underworld and were helpers of Erlik. They were said to be able to steal a person's kut (spirit). * Ker palyk: A powerful ancient fish that lives in a lake located at the foot of Pistag/Mustag Mountain. * Ak pozat: A white majestic horse belonging to Ul'gen. Lightning is said to be the whip of Ul'gen as he rides ak pozat. * Che ezi (master spirit of the place): Spirits that dwell in our world in specific locales like mountains, rivers or forests. They are protective spirits that must be respected when entering their domain.There are many elemental forms of che ezi depending on their dwelling place.Arbachakov (2008), p. 19-20 Some types also reside in the Heavenly Realm. * Samchi: A che ezi that lives in the Yellow Sky. He lives in the middle of this sky with his family in a home similar to that of humans.Arbachakov (2008), p. 13 Other popular deities the Shors recognized (along with other Turkic peoples) included:Arbachakov (2008), p. 25-27 * Tengri: The ancient Central Asian god of the sky. Shor clan elders led the Prayer to the Sky while the shamans rarely did. * Cher-Sug (Earth-Water): Deity that rules over the earth spirits and guardians of the mountains, forests, rocks, and rivers. * Umay: Goddess of fertility and birth. For the Shors, she was the guardian of newborns, children, mothers, and the spirit guide for the deceased. ==References== Flag of the Shor people == Bibliography == * Akiner, Shirin. (1986).

It aims to provide more efficient serialization than the text-based XML format. FI is effectively a lossless compression, analogous to gzip, for XML, except that while the original formatting is lost, no information is lost in the conversion from XML to FI, and back to XML. While the purpose of compression is to reduce physical data size, FI aims to optimize both document size and processing performance. The Fast Infoset specification is defined by both the ITU-T and the ISO standards bodies. FI is officially defined in ITU-T Rec. X.891 and ISO/IEC 24824-1, and entitled Fast Infoset. The standard was published by ITU-T on May 14, 2005, and by ISO on May 4, 2007. The Fast Infoset standard document can be downloaded from the ITU website. Though the document does not assert intellectual property (IP) restrictions on implementation or use, page ii warns that it has received notices and the subject may not be completely free of IP assertions. A common misconception is that FI requires ASN.1 tool support. Although the formal specification uses ASN.1 notation, the standard includes Encoding Control Notation (ECN) and ASN.1 tools are not required by implementations. An alternative to FI is FleXPath.Amer-Yahia, Sihem, Laks VS Lakshmanan, and Shashank Pandit. \\"FleXPath: flexible structure and full-text querying for XML.\\" Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data. ACM, 2004. ==Structure== The underlying file format is ASN.1, with tag/length/value blocks. Text values of attributes and elements are stored with length prefixes rather than end delimiters, and data segments do not require escapement for special characters. The equivalent of end tags (\\"terminators\\") are needed only at the end of a list of child-elements. Binary data is transmitted in native format, and need not be converted to a transmission format such as base64. Fast Infoset is a higher level format built on ASN.1 forms and notation. Element and attribute names are stored within the octet stream, unlike traditional ASN.1 encoding schemes. In consequence, The conventional XML file can be recovered from the binary stream without reference the XML Schema, and the XML Schema need not be expressed as an ASN.1 definition. (ASN.1 \\"Tags\\" are just type names, e.g. String, Integer, or complex types.) ASN.1 together with ECN is used to define the file format. An index table is built for most strings, which includes element and attribute names, and their values. This means that the text of repeated tags and values only appears once per document. ==ImplementationsReference implementation=== A Java implementation of the FI specification is available as part of the GlassFish project. The library is open source and is distributed under the terms of the Apache License 2.0. Several projects use this implementation, including the reference implementation for JAX-WS used in GlassFish Metro. QtitanFastInfoset - implementation for C++ is available under commercial license as a component for Digia Qt Framework. ==Performance== Because Fast Infosets are compressed as part of the XML generation process, they are much faster than using Zip-style compression algorithms on an XML stream, although the output is not as well compressed. SAX-type parsing performance of Fast Infoset is also much faster than parsing performance of XML 1.0, even without any Zip-style compression. Typical increases in parsing speed observed for the reference Java implementation are a factor of 10 over Java Xerces, and a factor of 4 over the Piccolo driver (one of the fastest Java-based XML parsers). ==Typical applications== Portable devices – Mobile devices typically have low bandwidth data connections and slower CPUs. Fast Infoset uses less bandwidth than XML and is faster to process, making it a superior choice. Storing large volumes of data – When storing XML to either file or database, the volume of data a system produces can often exceed reasonable limits, with a number of detriments: the access times go up as more data is read, CPU load goes up as XML data takes more power to process, and storage costs go up. By storing XML data in Fast Infoset format, data volume may be reduced by as much as 80 percent. Passing XML through the Internet – When an application passes data over the internet, network bandwidth can be a major bottleneck, seriously degrading the performance of client applications and limiting the server's power to process requests. Reducing the size of data transferred across the internet reduces the time required to send or receive the message, and increases the number of transactions a server can process per hour. ==See also== * Binary XML * Efficient XML Interchange * X3D ==References== ==External links== * A heavy technical description on OTN * FastInfoset.NET home page * FI project home page * Fast Infoset page at the ASN.1 site * OSS Fast Infoset Tools page * Free download of the Fast Infoset standard (ITU-T Rec.

First released on 4 February 1983, it became the band's highest charting release when it reached number two on the UK Albums Chart despite initially receiving poor reviews. It also reached number 137 on the American Billboard 200, number 85 on the Canadian RPM 100 Albums and number 24 on the Swedish chart. In 1984 the album was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry. Porcupine included the singles \\"The Back of Love\\" and \\"The Cutter\\". The album was recorded at Trident Studios in London, Rockfield Studios in South Wales and Amazon Studios in Liverpool. It was produced by Ian Broudie, who was credited as \\"Kingbird\\" and who had co-produced the band's first album, 1980's Crocodiles, and their second single, \\"Rescue\\". After being rejected by the band's label, the album was re-recorded with Shankar providing strings. It was originally released as an LP in 1983 before being reissued on CD in 1988. The album was again reissued on CD in 2003, along with the other four of the band's first five studio albums, having been remastered and expanded. A VHS video called Porcupine – An Atlas Adventure was also released containing six promotional videos of tracks from the album. ==ProductionBackground and recording=== Following the release of Heaven Up Here in 1981, Echo & the Bunnymen had difficulty writing new material for their next album despite rehearsing five days each week at The Ministry, their rehearsal room in Liverpool. While lead singer Ian McCulloch still wanted them to be the best band in the world, bass player Les Pattinson was expressing his weariness with the music industry, drummer Pete de Freitas produced and played drums on Liverpool band The Wild Swans' debut single \\"Revolutionary Spirit\\", and lead guitarist Will Sergeant recorded a solo album of instrumental music called Themes for 'Grind' (1982). On 27 January 1982 Echo & the Bunnymen recorded their fourth session for British disc jockey John Peel's radio show on BBC Radio 1. Of the tracks recorded, \\"Smack in the Middle\\" was renamed and became \\"Higher Hell\\" on the album, while \\"Taking Advantage\\" was renamed \\"The Back of Love\\" and became the band's third single which was also included on the album. Ian Broudie, who had co-produced 1980's Crocodiles and who was Sergeant's flatmate, was chosen to produce \\"The Back of Love\\" and the band's third album, whose working title was The Happy Loss.Adams, p.86Adams, p.91 The single, which became the band's first UK Top 20 hit single, was recorded in early 1982 at Trident Studios in Soho, London. This was unusual as the band's manager, Bill Drummond, had previously been keen to keep the band away from the temptations of London. The recording session for \\"The Back of Love\\" went well, but the relationship between the band members was strained, with them either not speaking to each other or, when they did, arguing.Adams, pp.86–87 Drummond was aware of the tensions within the band and so arranged a tour in Scotland for April 1982. This was done in an effort to make the band work harder, write some songs, and to communicate with each other. Drummond's plan failed to work as following the tour there was still tension between the band members.Adams, p.87 Two other album tracks – \\"Clay\\" and \\"My White Devil\\" – were first played during the tour of Scotland. Following the release of \\"The Back of Love\\" on 21 May 1982, the band spent the summer, first playing at the inaugural WOMAD festival, and then playing at various European music festivals. After the summer the band resumed recording the album at Rockfield Studios in South Wales – which had been used for the band's first two albums – and also at Amazon Studios in Liverpool. Recording the album was a slow process, de Freitas said, \\"Porcupine was very hard to actually write and record [...] Heaven Up Here was pure confidence, we did it really quickly; we had a great time doing it – but this one was like we had to drag it out of ourselves.\\" McCulloch later said that when recording the album, the mood between the band members was \\"horrible\\". When presented with the finished album, WEA rejected it as \\"too uncommercial\\".Adams, p.92 The band agreed to re-record the album, despite Sergeant's complaints. Using the original version of the album as a blueprint, the follow-up recording sessions went more smoothly. Drummond brought Shankar back to add strings to the other tracks on the album. It was these sessions that produced the band's next single, \\"The Cutter\\", which was released in January 1983 and went on to become the band's first Top 10 hit.Adams, 94–95 ===Porcupine – An Atlas Adventure=== alt=Four men in a bleak icy landscape. The man on the left is sitting, the two middle men are lying down and the man on the right is standing. After Echo & the Bunnymen had finished recording Porcupine they played a free show in early November 1982 for people at Sefton Park in Liverpool. Following this, WEA asked for three music videos and album art for the new album. The band's lighting engineer Bill Butt was chosen to direct the videos and Brian Griffin was chosen to take the photographs for the album's cover – as he had done for the band's two previous albums. With a budget of £ Butt decided that it would be possible to get the photographs for the album cover and also to produce a half-hour film.Adams, pg.93 Deciding that he wanted the videos to reflect the frigid feel of the music on the album, Butt chose to shoot the videos in Scotland. However, it was not certain that there would be enough snow in Scotland during November so Iceland was chosen as the location to shoot the videos. Filming took place on and near the frozen Gullfoss waterfall near Reykjavík. Feeling it was a dangerous process, McCulloch said in 1993, \\"If we had slipped there wasn't anything for hundreds of feet below us.\\" In 2001 Griffin said, \\"[...] the sun barely appeared the whole time we were there. To walk, stand up, or just think seemed a massive effort.\\" Despite the danger the filming proved its worth when the British music magazine Q said in 2001, \\"The Porcupine cover is the epitome of rock band as heroic archetype – young men on some ill-defined but glorious mission, one easily as timeless as the stars and the sea.\\"Adams, pg.94 The filming was finished in December 1982 with the band performing songs from the album at their rehearsal room at The Ministry. Butt interspersed this with clips from the 1929 Russian documentary The Man With the Movie Camera and he also projected psychedelic watercolour effects onto the band. A VHS video was subsequently released by Castle Hendring in 1983 called Porcupine – An Atlas Adventure which contained the six music videos – \\"In Bluer Skies\\", \\"The Cutter\\", \\"My White Devil\\", \\"Porcupine\\", \\"Heads Will Roll\\" and \\"The Back of Love\\". Describing the album cover, journalist Dave Rimmer wrote in British music magazine Smash Hits, \\"Iceland does seem an appropriate location for this group. It's isolated, cold, bleak and fits perfectly with the moody image they've attracted to themselves.\\" ===Musical content=== After WEA rejected the first version of the album, Shankar – who had played strings on \\"The Back of Love\\" – was brought back by Drummond to add strings to the remainder of the album in an effort to give it a brighter production and to build on the success of the strings used on the single. When recording \\"The Cutter\\", Sergeant had asked Shankar if he could suggest the melody from Cat Stevens' 1967 hit \\"Matthew and Son\\". In 1984 McCulloch said, \\"I think Porcupine was a classic autobiographical album, the most honest thing that I'd ever written or sung.\\"Adams, p.101 Talking about how the album made him feel, he went on to say, \\"I found the material from it really heavy to play – like, really oppressive. That's the only reason why I didn't like the album. The songs were great but it didn't make me happy.\\" He also said, \\"A lot of songs are about coming to terms with the opposites in me.\\"Adams, p.103 ==Releases== Porcupine was first released as an LP by Korova in the United Kingdom on 4 February 1983. It was subsequently released in the United States by Sire Records on 23 February 1983. The original album had ten tracks with five tracks on each side. Like Echo & the Bunnymen's previous album, the album cover was designed by Martyn Atkins and the photography was by Brian Griffin. The album was released on CD on 7 April 1988. Along with the other four of the band's first five albums, Porcupine was remastered and reissued on CD in 2003 – these releases were marketed as 25th anniversary editions. Seven bonus tracks were added to the album: \\"Fuel\\" was the second B-side track on the 12-inch version of \\"The Back of Love\\"; alternate versions of \\"The Cutter\\", \\"My White Devil\\", \\"Porcupine\\", \\"Ripeness\\" and \\"Gods Will Be Gods\\" which were all early versions recorded during the album's sessions; and \\"Never Stop (Discotheque)\\" the 12-inch version of the non-album single which was released after Porcupine. The alternate versions of \\"My White Devil\\", \\"Porcupine\\" and \\"Ripeness\\" had all previously been unissued. The reissued album was produced by Andy Zax and Bill Inglot. There were two tracks from the original Porcupine album which had been released as singles. The first of these was \\"The Back of Love\\" which had been released on 21 May 1982. The second single was \\"The Cutter\\" which was released on 14 January 1983. \\"Never Stop (Discotheque)\\", which was originally a non- album single when it was released on 8 July 1983, was subsequently included on the 2003 remastered version of the album as a bonus track. ==Reception== Following the release of Porcupine in 1983, NME reviewer Barney Hoskyns gave the album a negative review. Hoskyns wrote, \\"Porcupine is the distressing occasion of an important and exciting rock group becoming ensnared by its own strongest points, a dynamic force striving fruitlessly to escape the brilliant track that trails behind it.\\" Hoskyns likened the sound of the album to the band \\"turning on their own greatest 'hits' and savaging them\\". Hoskyns also criticised McCulloch's lyrics and the general mood of the album, noting, \\"Only on 'Porcupine' itself do the various strains of despair coalesce\\", and dismissed the entire second side of the album, saying it \\"horrifies the more for its uniform lack of inspiration, for the fact that every number cops direct from earlier songs without preserving anything of their energy or invention\\". Record reviewer Wayne King similarly commented that the album reused many motifs, such as Ian McCullough's octave jumps, from their previous albums. While he praised the opening tracks \\"The Cutter\\" and \\"Back of Love\\", he remarked that Porcupine as a whole was not nearly as good an album as Echo and the Bunnymen's live performances showed they were capable of. In a review of the original release on AllMusic, Porcupine was described as a \\"solid outing\\", a \\"noticeably better listen than its predecessor, Heaven Up Here\\" and \\"well worth hearing\\". When reviewing the remastered 2003 version the review was expanded to add that new release was \\"a very well done expansion of an already fine album\\". Blender magazine described the album in a review on their website as \\"impossibly exciting pop-rock\\" and Pitchfork called the album \\"the band's definitive statement\\" and described the track \\"The Back of Love\\" as \\"the astonishing highlight of the group's career\\". CMJ critic Eric Chappe wrote that \\"the constant emotional peaks and valleys of Porcupine may be perhaps too strong for some, but the musical peaks achieved in getting there are really something to behold.\\" The album appeared in the 1983 end of year critics' lists for both Melody Maker, where it was listed at number nine, and NME, where it was listed at number 32. The album is also listed in the 2006 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. The album reached number 2 on the UK Albums Chart, number 137 on the American Billboard 200, number 85 on the Canadian RPM 100 Albums, and number 24 on the Swedish albums chart.

Ranchi city, the capital of Jharkhand state is the district headquarters. It was established as a district in 1899. It was made the capital of Jharkhand state which was formed in 2000 from Bihar state. As of 2011 it is the most populous district of Jharkhand (out of 24). ==History== The early evidence of use of several Iron slag, pot sheds, Iron tools found in Chota Nagpur region around 1400 BCE. Magadha Empire exercised indirect control over the territory, which lasted until the reign of the Ashoka. Kalinga rulers are believed to have ravaged the region during their expeditions to Rajgir and Pataliputra. Armies of Samudra Gupta passed through the region on their expedition to Deccan. After the decline of the Guptas, Phanimukut established the Nagvanshi dynasty, which ruled Ranchi district and part of Chota Nagpur Plateau as a sovereign king for almost next 1000 years. Khukhragarh was one of Capital of Nagvanshi dynasty. With the expansion of the Mughal Empire, the sovereign status of the Nag Dynasty was technically affected, but they continued to rule and administer independently until the advent of the East India Company. Thakur Vishwanath Shahdeo, Pandey Ganpat Rai, Tikait Umrao Singh and Sheikh Bhikhari played pivotal role in Indian Rebellion of 1857. During the period of the British Raj, adivasis and the local population of other ethnic backgrounds of Ranchi and other regions currently comprising the State of Jharkhand continued to oppose the subjugation by the British, and the region witnessed a number of uprisings and revolts. ==GeographyClimate=== Ranchi has a humid subtropical climate. However, due to its position and the forests around the city, it is known for its pleasant climate. Its climate is the primary reason why Ranchi was once the summer capital of the undivided State of Bihar. Ranchi used to be a preferable hill station in the past. Temperature ranges from maximum 42 to 20 °C during summer, and from 25 to 0 °C during winter. December and January are the coolest months with temperature getting to freezing point in some places of the city. The annual rainfall is about 1430 mm (56.34 inches). From June to September the rainfall is about 1,100 mm. Ranchi is located at 23°21′N 85°20′E.[5] The total area covered by the Ranchi municipal area is 175.12 square kilometres and the average elevation of the city is 651 m above sea level. Ranchi is located on the southern part of the Chota Nagpur plateau which forms the eastern edge of the Deccan plateau. Ranchi is referred to as the \\"City of Waterfalls\\", due to the presence of numerous large and small falls of around the close vicinity of the city. The most popular ones are Dassam Falls, Hundru Falls, Jonha Falls, Hirni Falls and Panchghagh Falls. The Subarnarekha river and its tributaries constitute the local river system. Dams in Kanke, Rukka and Hatia have been built over these channels to cater to the water requirements of majority the population. Ranchi has a hilly topography and its combination with dense tropical forests ensures that it enjoys a comparatively moderate climate compared to the rest of the state. Previously, it was accorded a 'hill station' status during the British rule. Rapid population growth and industrialization have caused considerable change in the weather pattern and rise in average temperatures. This has resulted in gradual loss of this \\"Hill Station\\" like status. It also has numerous dams constructed in different regions of the city inside and on the outskirts. ==Economy== In 2006 the Indian government named Ranchi one of the country's 250 most backward districts (out of a total of 640). It is one of the 23 districts in Jharkhand currently receiving funds from the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme (BRGF). ==Divisions== Presently, Ranchi district is divided into 2 sub- divisions and 14 administrative blocks. On 12 September 2007, Khunti district was created by carving Khunti subdivision and its 6 blocks out of Ranchi district. Ranchi sub-division is further divided into 11 blocks: Angara, Burmu, Bero, Chanho, Kanke, Lapung, Mandar, Namkum, Ormanjhi, Ratu and Silli. Bundu sub-division comprises 3 blocks: Bundu, Sonahatu,and Tamar, The district has 7 Vidhan Sabha constituencies, namely, Tamar, Silli, Khijri, Ranchi, Hatia, Kanke, and Mandar. Silli, Khijri, Ranchi, Hatia and Kanke are part of Ranchi Lok Sabha constituency. ==Demographics== According to the 2011 census Ranchi district has a population of 2,914,253, roughly equal to the nation of Jamaica or the US state of Arkansas. This gives it a ranking of 130th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 23.9%. Ranchi has a sex ratio of 950 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 77.13%.

Duncan with President John F. Kennedy Robert Blackford Duncan (December 4, 1920April 29, 2011) was an American politician from the state of Oregon. A Democrat, he served multiple terms in the Oregon Legislative Assembly and as a U.S. congressman from Oregon. In the Oregon House of Representatives he served as speaker for four years, and in the U.S. House he represented two different districts. The Illinois native and World War II veteran ran three unsuccessful campaigns to be elected to the U.S. Senate. == Early life == Robert B. Duncan was born in Normal, Illinois, on December 4, 1920. His father, Eugene Duncan, came to Illinois from a family in Missouri whose ascendants were originally from Scotland. His mother, Catherine Blackford, was of Welsh origin—her parents had immigrated from Wales to the United States in the late 19th century. Robert \\"Bob\\" Duncan was the second of four boys: Carter, Bob, Clark and John Bruce. He attended public schools in Bloomington.Duncan, Robert Blackford. Biographical Directory of the United States Congress. Retrieved December 20, 2007. In 1939, at the age of 18, he went with a friend to Alaska and he began college at the University of Alaska, staying through 1940 when he transferred to Illinois Wesleyan University where he graduated in 1942 with a bachelor's degree. In college he met fellow student Marijane Beverly Dill (born June 30, 1920) and the two were married on December 19, 1942.Marijane Duncan, ex-official's wife, dies. The Oregonian, November 13, 1990. The couple would have seven children together: Nancy Guri, Angus, David, James, Laurie, Bonnie Dee and Jeanne. While in Alaska he had worked in the gold fields, and while in Illinois he had worked for a bank and seed company. During World War II, he served in the United States Merchant Marine and in the United States Naval Air Force as a pilot from 1942 to 1945. In 1948, Duncan received his LL.B from the University of Michigan Law School and passed the bar in October of that year. After graduation Duncan and his family moved from Michigan to Portland and then to Medford in Southern Oregon, where he moved to join the law practice of William M. McAllister. ==Political career== In 1954, Duncan was nominated as a write-in candidate for the Oregon House of Representatives. Although he declined for economic reasons, in 1956, he was elected to the Oregon House, serving three terms and was elected Speaker of the Oregon House by his colleagues. In 1962, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives representing Oregon's 4th congressional district based in Medford. Official portrait, 1975 In the 1966 U.S. Senate election, Duncan was the Democratic candidate for the seat vacated by retiring Senator Maurine B. Neuberger. While Duncan strongly supported President Johnson's Vietnam War policies, his Republican opponent, Governor Mark Hatfield, was an outspoken critic. The differences between Duncan and Hatfield on the war would produce one of the great splits in the modern Oregon Democratic Party. The state's senior U.S. Senator, Wayne Morse—a staunch Democratic opponent of the Vietnam War—endorsed Hatfield over fellow Democrat Duncan, an act that infuriated Democratic Party regulars. This factor, along with Hatfield's statewide popularity, gave Hatfield a narrow victory. In 1967, Duncan moved to Portland where he lived until 1974, returning to the practice of law. In 1968, Duncan came back to challenge Senator Morse in the Democratic Senate primary. Again, Duncan's war views played a role. Though Duncan was initially far ahead of the anti-war maverick Morse, Morse closed the gap at the end and won a narrow victory, aided by the beginning of the Paris Peace Accords, which brought the possibility of the end of the war. Morse went on to narrowly lose in the general election to Republican state Representative Bob Packwood, who favored continued funding of the war. Duncan returned to his Portland law practice. He ran once more for the Senate in 1972, again losing the Democratic nomination to Morse, this time by a wider margin. Morse then lost to Senator Hatfield. After Edith Green retired from Congress, Duncan ran for her Portland-based seat from in 1974 and returned to the House. He served another three terms, and was upset in the 1980 Democratic primary by eventual winner Ron Wyden. == Later years and family == In 1985, he returned to live in Oregon, settling in the coastal community of Yachats. He served on the Northwest Power Planning Council from 1984 to 1988, and as its chairperson in 1987. Following his work on the Council (he left the Council in 1988), Duncan spent his time working on his house in Yachats and on his collection of old cars, and spending time with his seven grandchildren. Duncan's first wife, Marijane, died November 9, 1990. The couple had seven children. In 1995, Duncan married Kathryn Boe, widow of Jason Boe who had served in the Oregon Senate from 1970 to 1980, four terms as Senate president. Duncan lived in Portland until his death at the age of 90 at the Mirabella retirement home on April 29, 2011. His papers are housed in the Robert Blackford Duncan collection at the University of Oregon. A four volume book of his writings is in that collection and also is in the archival collections of Illinois Wesleyan University, Normal, Illinois; the University of Alaska in Fairbanks; and the Oregon Historical Society, Portland. ==References== ==External links== *The Political Graveyard * Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Oregon Category:Speakers of the Oregon House of Representatives Category:1920 births Category:2011 deaths Category:People from Normal, Illinois Category:Politicians from Medford, Oregon Category:University of Alaska Fairbanks alumni Category:Illinois Wesleyan University alumni Category:University of Michigan Law School alumni Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:United States Navy personnel Category:Oregon Democrats Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:20th-century American politicians ","title":"Robert B.

He spent most of his career at the University of Oxford, and worked on numerous topics. Throughout his career, he showed strong preferences for experimental methods in social psychology, having little time for alternative approaches such as discourse analysis. ==Life== Michael Argyle was born in Nottingham on 11 August 1925. He was educated at Nottingham High School for Boys. After completing with distinction a Royal Air Force science course at the University of Cambridge he trained as a navigator in Canada (1943-7). In June 1949 Michael married Sonia Kemp and they had four children, Miranda (1952), Nick (1954), Rosalind (1957) and Ophelia (1963). After the war he read part one in moral sciences at Emmanuel College, Cambridge and in 1950 graduated with first class honours in experimental psychology. Following two years of postgraduate study in Cambridge he became the first ever lecturer in social psychology at the University of Oxford, where he worked for many years. At the time, Oxford University was, along with the London School of Economics, one of only two universities in the United Kingdom to have a department of social psychology. He became a fellow of the newly founded Wolfson College, Oxford in 1966 and three years later a reader. He was one of the very early pioneers of social psychology in the UK and Europe and helped to initiate the British Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology as the first social psychology editor (1961-7). In 1968 he set up a social skills training programme at Littlemore Hospital, Oxford. He chaired the social psychology section of the British Psychological Society twice (1964-7, 1972-4). Distinguished psychologists and sociologists from all over the world visited the research group he set up at Oxford. He received honorary doctorates from the universities of Oxford (1979), Adelaide and Brussels (1982) and an honorary fellowship of the British Psychological Society (1992). In 1990 The International Society of the Study of Personal Relationships in 1990 gave him a distinguished career contribution award. After his retirement, he became Professor Emeritus at Oxford Brookes University. He regularly attended social psychology conferences. He had a great passion for Scottish country dancing. His wife Sonia died in 1999 and Argyle died on 6 September 2002, at the age of 77, of injuries suffered in a swimming accident, from which he never fully recovered. ==Work== Some of Argyle's best-known contributions were to this field. He was especially interested in gaze. One of his best-known books relevant to this field, The Psychology of Interpersonal Behaviour, became a best-seller. Argyle made contributions to many fields in psychology, including: * psychology of religion * social skills * nonverbal communication * the psychology of happiness * the psychology of social class ===Communication cycle=== Argyle made modifications in 1972 to the communication cycle initially developed by Charles Berner in 1965. The communication cycle involves six steps: someone decides to communicate an idea, encodes it, and sends it; someone else receives it, decodes it and understands it. Feedback demonstrates understanding (e.g. an action is performed or a reply message is encoded and sent). The model allows for the possibility of distortion at either the encoding or decoding stage.Rasheed, E., Hetherington, A. and Irvine, J., 2013, BTEC Level 3: Health and Social Care, page 7 ===Psychology of religion=== Argyle, a committed Christian, published empirical works on the psychology of religion. His early work in this field was summarized in his book Religious Behaviour (1958). He also collaborated with Benjman Beit-Hallahmi to produce a later book, \\"The Psychology of Religious Beliefs, Behaviour and Experience\\" (1997). Both books show Argyle's commitment to empiricism in psychology, and list results of surveys into topics such as beliefs in the afterlife or frequencies of religious experience in the general population. ===Psychology of happiness=== One of Argyle's most notable later contributions was to the psychology of happiness. Keen that more research should be done in this field, he published \\"The Psychology of Happiness\\" in 1987, 2nd edition 2001. In this book he listed and discussed empirical findings on happiness, including that happiness is indeed promoted by relationships, faith, sex, eating, exercise, music, success, etc., but probably not by wealth. ===Psychology of social class=== Although social class is a concept largely studied by sociologists, Argyle's later work showed increasing interest in promotion of socio- psychological perspective on social class. Differences in religious involvement across social class and patterns of social relationship across social class are areas of interest to social psychologists here, and these fields show Argyle was keen to link this area to other areas which he had studied. ==Publications== *The Scientific Study of Social Behaviour (Methuen 1957) *Religious Behaviour (Routledge & Kegan Paul 1958) *Training Managers (Acton Society Trust 1962), with Trevor Smith *Psychology and Social Problems (Methuen 1964) *The Psychology of Interpersonal Behaviour (Penguin 1967) *Social Interaction (Tavistock Publications 1969) *The Social Psychology of Work (Allen Lane 1972), *Skills With People: A Guide for Managers (Hutchinson 1973), , with Elizabeth Sidney and Margaret Brown *Bodily Communication (Methuen 1975), *Gaze and Mutual Gaze (Cambridge University Press 1976), , with Mark Cook *Social Skills and Mental Health (Methuen 1978), , with Peter Trower and Bridget Bryant *Person to Person: Ways of Communicating (Harper & Row 1979), , with Peter Trower *Social Situations (Cambridge University Press 1981), , with Adrian Furnham and Jean Ann Graham *The Psychology of Happiness (Methuen 1987), *Cooperation: The Basis of Sociability (Routledge 1991), *The Social Psychology of Everyday Life (Routledge 1992), *The Psychology of Social Class (Routledge 1994), *The Social Psychology of Leisure (Penguin 1996), *The Psychology of Religious Behaviour, Belief and Experience (Routledge 1997), , with Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi *The Psychology of Money (Routledge 1998), , with Adrian Furnham plus numerous edited books, chapters, and articles in learned journals ==Further reading== * R.Lamb and M.

The river rises in Mashonaland East, just north of Chivhu, and approximately south of Harare. It runs approximately north-west and for much of its length it originally formed the southern border of Mashonaland province, and today is largely the southern border of Mashonaland West.

The river flow is highly variable, reflecting the sharp distinction in the local climate between dry and wet seasons. Between December and May it flows strongly and is about deep on the plateau, and in breadth (although less deep) on its lower reaches.

MOPAC2007 included the new Sparkle/AM1, Sparkle/PM3, RM1 and PM6 models, with an increased emphasis on solid state capabilities. However, it does not have yet MINDO/3, PM5, analytical derivatives, the Tomasi solvation model and intersystem crossing. MOPAC2007 was followed by the release of MOPAC2009 in 2008 which presents many improved features The latest versions are no longer public domain software as were the earlier versions such as MOPAC6 and MOPAC7. However, there are recent efforts to keep MOPAC7 working as open source software. An open source version of MOPAC7 for Linux is also available.MOPAC7 Open Source Version The author of MOPAC, James Stewart, released in 2006 a public domain version of MOPAC7 entirely written in Fortran 90 called MOPAC7.1. ==See also== *Semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods *AMPAC *Quantum chemistry computer programs ==References== ==External links== * MOPAC 2016 sales and support information * MOPAC 2002 Manual * MOPAC 2009 Manual * Source code and compiled binaries at the Computational Chemistry List repository: ** Source code (in FORTRAN): ***MOPAC 6 *** MOPAC 7 ** Compiled binaries: *** MOPAC 6 for MS-DOS/Windows; *** MOPAC 6 for Windows 95/NT; *** MOPAC 6 with GUI (Winmostar) *** MOPAC 7 for MS-DOS/Windows *** MOPAC 7 for Linux *** MOPAC 2009 for Linux Windows and Mac * MOPAC-5.022mn (MOPAC at the University of Minnesota) Category:Computational chemistry software ","title":"MOPAC"},{"id":"2233721","text":"SpreadsheetML is the XML schema for Microsoft Office Excel 2003.

It was founded in 1966 by climbers and mountaineers Peter Lockey and Gordon Davison, initially as an importer and distributor of outdoors products. Lockey and Davison's outdoor store in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK, went by the name of the LD Mountain Centre. In 1972 they began designing and manufacturing their own products for sale in their shop. They gave their brand the German name 'Berghaus' which translates as 'mountain house'. Berghaus offers a range of men's, women's and children's outdoor clothing and equipment, including waterproof jackets, fleeces, baselayers and legwear. They also produce a selection of outdoor specific accessories and footwear. ==History== \\"It all began when climbers and mountaineers Peter Lockey and Gordon Davison from the North East of England, frustrated by what they saw as a lack of decent outdoor gear, decided to import and sell their own. Their specialist outdoor store in Newcastle-upon- Tyne, England, went by the name of the LD Mountain Centre and quickly gained a reputation for selling the very best in high-performance outdoor products from the likes of Atomic Skis, Marker Bindings and Nordica Ski.\\" ===1970s=== The first Berghaus rucksacks were launched in 1970 – the Berg 172 and Berg 272 models had external frames and basic single compartments. These more traditional sacks were followed two years later in 1972 by the Cyclops rucksack – arguably the world’s first rucksack with an internal frame. In 1977 Berghaus became one of Europe's pioneer users of Gore-Tex® fabric, a new waterproof and breathable fabric. This was followed in 1979 by the development of the Yeti Gaiter, whose distinctive rubber rands were initially made from old tractor inner tubes. ===1980s=== In the 1980s the Gemini jacket was introduced, and is still in production today; it allowed a walking jacket to have a zip-in fleece. It was also in the early 1980s that mountaineer Sir Chris Bonington, 'officially' wore Berghaus. It was also around this time that Alan Hinkes – who would go on to become the UK's most successful extreme altitude mountaineer – began working with the company. In 1986 the Extrem range was launched and included the Trango Jacket. The Attak sole unit was introduced the following year and exported around the world. Berghaus were awarded the Queen's Award for Export in 1988 and the Northern Business Award for Exporter of the Year. ===1990s=== 1993 saw a significant development in Berghaus' history as Pentland Group PLC, home to sports brands Speedo and Ellesse, acquired Berghaus. The early 1990s also saw Berghaus turn its attention to footwear, launching its very first footwear collection. The collection included the Storm boot, a three-season fabric hiking boot. As a new century approached Berghaus introduced the Simplex concept in 1997: the idea was that by minimising the layers of fabric in a garment and getting rid of any unnecessary styling you achieve a more breathable, lightweight product. 1999 saw the introduction of new lightweight and packable outerwear available at the time – Gore-Tex PacLite, a waterproof, windproof and breathable range of clothing. The Nitro rucksack, introduced by Berghaus in 1998, was awarded the Millennium Product Award by the Design Council of Great Britain. ==2000s–presentMtnHaus=== In 2011 Berghaus unveiled its new design and development team, MtnHaus, to the world. The MtnHaus team works with Berghaus- sponsored athletes, such as Leo Houlding and Mick Fowler, to produce kit for specific challenges, which means extended design, development and testing periods. So far the MtnHaus team have produced five products including the Asgard Smock, which went through 18 prototypes before the design was finalised. In 2013, the team developed the award-winning Vapour Storm Jacket. ===Berghaus-sponsored athletes=== Berghaus now have a team of over 21 athletes from all over the globe, including: *Climber Leo Houlding *Mountaineer Mick Fowler *Hand biker Karen Darke Berghaus now also has several stores throughout the UK, including Bristol, Manchester, Covent Garden in London, Dalton Park in County Durham, Bridgend and Gretna. ==References== ==External links== *Berghaus Website Category:Outdoor clothing brands Category:Clothing brands of the United Kingdom Category:British brands Category:Mountaineering equipment manufacturers Category:Clothing companies of the United Kingdom ","title":"Berghaus"},{"id":"2233734","text":"Chris Crutcher (born July 17, 1946) is an American novelist and a family therapist. He received the Margaret A. Edwards Award from the American Library Association in 2000 for his lifetime contribution in writing for teens. ==Biography== Crutcher was born July 17, 1946 to a World War II B17 bomber pilot and a homemaker in Dayton, Ohio. A few weeks after his birth, his father gave up flying and the family moved to his mother's hometown of Cascade, Idaho where his father could open an oil and gas wholesale business and he could grow up. After graduating from high school, Crutcher attended Eastern Washington State College (now Eastern Washington University) where he swam competitively and earned a BA in psychology and sociology. With no post- graduation plans or prospects, he went back to Eastern and got a teaching certificate. Crutcher taught at several primary and secondary schools in California and Washington before beginning his writing career. After his first book was completed, he joined Spokane's Child Protection Team and began practicing as a child and family therapist.Prince, Julie. \\"Teacher, Therapist, Free Speech Advocate: An Interview with Chris Crutcher.\\" Teacher Librarian 37.2 (Dec 2009): 70–72. ==Writing== Crutcher's debut novel was Running Loose in 1983 about a senior in high school who has it all until life throws him for a few loops. Many of his novels concern teenaged athletes who have personal problems. Most of his protagonists are male, teenage athletes, often swimmers, and recurring supporting characters include a wise Asian-American teacher or coach and a caring journalism teacher. Chris Crutcher's writing is controversial, and has been frequently challenged and even bannedhttp://librarian.lishost.org/?p=716 by individuals who want to censor his books by removing them from libraries and classrooms. Athletic Shorts: Six Short Stories and Running Loose were #63 and #92 on the ALA list of 100 books most frequently challenged during the 1990s.\\"100 most frequently challenged books: 1990–1999\\". Banned & Challenged Books. ALA. Retrieved 2013-10-13. His books generally feature teens coping with serious problems, including abusive parents, racial and religious prejudice, mental and physical disability, and poverty; these themes are viewed by some as too mature for children. Other cited reasons for censorship include strong language and depictions of homosexuality.Author, Chris Crutcher – Censorship . Despite this controversy, Crutcher's writing has received many awards. Crutcher has also written an autobiography called King of the Mild Frontier (2003), an adult novel titled The Deep End (1991), and two collections of short stories, Athletic Shorts: Six Short Stories (1991) and Angry Management (2009), some of which further explore characters from his previous novels. One of the stories from Athletic Shorts: Six Short Stories, \\"A Brief Moment in the Life of Angus Bethune\\", was made into a film called Angus. The ALA Margaret A.

The show is aimed at adult audiences, and takes its name from the main character. The half-hour show takes place in Ottawa, Ontario, and is based on the flash cartoon of the same name that premiered on Mondo Media's flash cartoon site in the late nineties. It also aired on Spike TV in the US in 2003. ==Characters== The show revolves around the everyday happenings of the Spencer family. Kevin himself is a 14-year-old, chain-smoking, alcoholic, cough syrup-addicted, sociopathic juvenile delinquent. He lives with his parents, whom he often shows ambivalence towards, and is a student at a local high school, although he rarely attends school. It is demonstrated multiple times throughout the series that Kevin is mentally unstable, as he is prone to random outbursts of violence, even towards himself, shows signs of insanity, and has a complete disregard for life, including his own. It is also shown that Kevin is probably mentally challenged, as he often has difficulties with performing the simplest of tasks, such as making himself a bowl of cereal, forgetting what he was talking about the instant after saying something, or even realizing that he was hungry, yet at times throughout the series makes very well-articulated statements about certain aspects of society, culture, politics, and education, possibly indicating Kevin is a savant. Throughout the series, Kevin almost never speaks, aside from during dream sequences and occasional one-sentenced outbursts. Instead, the show's narrator (voiced by Lawrence) speaks for Kevin; that is, he describes what Kevin is saying, thinking, and how Kevin reacts to the world around him. His parents, Anastasia (voiced by Thomasin Langlands) and Percy (voiced by Lawrence), are also alcoholic, cough syrup-addicted chain-smokers. Both are crude, overweight, unattractive and extraordinarily stupid people who live off of welfare. Both parents neglect or otherwise use Kevin for their own selfish gains, and both show clear signs of sociopathic tendencies. Neither parent is faithful to the other, and Anastasia in particular is highly promiscuous. Their antics usually involve attempting to gain money or alcohol through illegal acts, which quite randomly succeed or fail. While both parents primarily show hatred and disgust towards one another, both occasionally demonstrate a small degree of love (or at least lust) for each other, though these moments rarely last longer than a scene of an episode. Another frequent character in the show is Kevin's imaginary friend, Allen the Magic Goose (voiced by Mike Wetmore). Allen often encourages Kevin's sociopathic nature, usually asking him to do illegal, indecent, and/or dangerous things simply for the sake of the thrill or for vengeance. However, Kevin, being a sociopath, often shows ambivalence towards Allen, sometimes threatening or intimidating the bird. During such times, Allen often reminds Kevin of the futility of these outbursts, since Kevin is simply imagining Allen's existence. ==Common plots== Most of the adventures on the show involve illegal actions and antics of the Spencer family. Their motives for these actions range from attempting to acquire more money, alcohol, drugs, or merely for the sake of having something to do. Oftentimes, the show will shift between Kevin's antics and his parents', as well as follow some subplots of other minor characters that tie into the Spencers' schemes and adventures. Episode 8 of season 1 was only aired once before it was banned from TV, due to excessive violence and disgusting humor. ==Streaming== Ocnus Productions (creators of Kevin Spencer) sold the rights to the series around May/June 2011 to Netflix. The seasons were therefore removed from Expressmedia.ca where Manufacture-On-Demand DVDs had been available for sale for several years. All 8 seasons were made available in the US on Netflix's streaming service July 15, 2011, although as of December 2011 the show failed to appear on Netflix's Canadian version of the streaming service. On July 17, 2012, Netflix stopped featuring it altogether. Seasons 1 and 2 were later added on to Hulu the same year. All 8 seasons of the series are currently available on Amazon Prime Video and Tubi. ==External links== *Tv.com summary * Category:1999 Canadian television series debuts Category:2005 Canadian television series endings Category:1990s Canadian adult animated television series Category:1990s Canadian animated comedy television series Category:1990s Canadian high school television series Category:2000s Canadian adult animated television series Category:2000s Canadian animated comedy television series Category:2000s Canadian high school television series Category:Canadian adult animated comedy television series Category:English-language television shows Category:CTV Comedy Channel original programming Category:Television controversies in Canada Category:Animated television series about teenagers Category:Animated television series about dysfunctional families Category:Television shows set in Ottawa ","title":"Kevin Spencer (TV series)"},{"id":"2233770","text":"Tootsie Roll Industries is an American manufacturer of confectionery. Its best-known products have been Tootsie Rolls and Tootsie Pops. Tootsie Roll Industries currently markets its brands internationally in Canada, Mexico, and over 75 other countries. ==History== In 1896, Leo Hirshfield, an Austrian Jewish immigrant to the United States, began work at a small candy shop located in New York City owned by the Stern & Staalberg firm. Entry \\"Tootsie Roll\\", p 271. In 1907, Hirshfield decided he wanted a chocolate-tasting candy that would not melt in the heat, and that would be an economical artificial alternative to traditional chocolates. He named the candy after the nickname of his daughter, Clara \\"Tootsie\\" Hirshfield.Ellen Rubin Gordon 1995 interview on ABC-TV World News Now, reading 1972 letter from Clara \\"Tootsie\\" Hirshfield, written when she was 83 years old By this point, the company had expanded to a five-story factory. In 1917, the name of the company was changed to The Sweets Company of America. It was reformed and listed on the American Stock Exchange in 1919. The business forced Hirshfield out about a year later, and he started a new company, Mells Candy Corporation, also known as The Merry Mells Company. Owing to health and family issues, he committed suicide in 1922. Mells failed in 1924. In 1931, the Tootsie Pop — a hard-candy lollipop with Tootsie Roll filling — was invented, and quickly became popular with Dust Bowl refugees during the Depression era because of its low price. During World War II, Tootsie Rolls became a standard part of American soldiers' field rations, due to the hardiness of the candy under a variety of environmental conditions. In 1935, the company was in serious difficulty. Its principal supplier of paper boxes, Joseph Rubin & Sons of Brooklyn — concerned about the possible loss of an important customer — became interested in the possibility of acquiring control. The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but Bernard D. Rubin acquired a list of shareholders and approached them in person in order to purchase their shares. The Rubins eventually achieved control and agreed that Bernard would run the company as president. Mr. Rubin was able to steadily increase sales and restore profits, changing the formula of the Tootsie Roll and increasing its size, moving from Manhattan to a much larger plant in Hoboken, New Jersey, and guiding the company successfully through the difficult war years when vital raw materials were in short supply. When he died in 1948, he had increased the sales volume twelvefold. After his death, his brother William B. Rubin became president and remained president until 1962. In 1962, William's daughter, Ellen Rubin Gordon, took control, and as of January 2015, is Chairman and CEO of the company. For many years prior to his death, her husband, Melvin Gordon, was Chairman and CEO from 1962 to 2015. In 1966, the company adopted its current name of \\"Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc.\\" The company has acquired several famous brands of confections such as The Candy Corporation of America's Mason Division (1972), Cella's Confections (1985), The Charms Company (1988), Warner-Lambert's candy division (1993; excluding gum and mints), Andes Candies (2000), and Concord Confections (2004). ==Facilities== The company's headquarters is located on the South side of Chicago, in a portion of the former Dodge Chicago Plant which produces the majority of its candy. The company also has a factory in Mexico City where it produces some flavors of Tootsie Pops and other candy products for the Mexican market as well as for export to the U.S. and Canada. There is also a candy factory in The Port neighborhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts (belonging to the subsidiary \\"Cambridge Brands\\", formerly home to its predecessor, the James O. Welch Company). ==Brands and products== A large Tootsie Roll log Dots gumdrops Tootsie Roll brands and products include: * Tootsie Rolls and Tootsie Pops * Frooties fruit flavored chewy candy * Child's Play assorted candies * Dots gumdrops and Crows licorice candy * Sugar Daddy and Sugar Babies * Andes Chocolate Mints * Charms Blow Pops and Caramel Apple Pops * Charleston Chew candy bars * Junior Mints * Cella's chocolate-covered cherries * Fluffy Stuff cotton candy * Dubble Bubble, Thrills, Razzles, and Cry Baby chewing gum * Nik-L-Nip juice confection * Wax Lips flavored wax candy * Candy Blox * Polar Mint ==References== ==External links== * Tootsie Roll Industries web site Category:Confectionery companies of the United States Category:Manufacturing companies based in Chicago Category:American companies established in 1896 Category:Food and drink companies established in 1896 Category:1896 establishments in Illinois Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange Category:American brands ","title":"Tootsie Roll Industries"},{"id":"2233771","text":"June Lake is a subalpine lake within the Inyo National Forest, in Mono County, eastern California.

The corresponding rating within the United States Coast Guard is health services technician (HS). ==Overview== Small metallic badge affixed to the left side of the MCCUU collar when worn by corpsmen; it was previously worn on the BDU and DCU A corpsman aboard an aircraft carrier in 1999 Hospital corpsmen work in a wide variety of capacities and locations, including shore establishments such as naval hospitals and clinics, aboard ships, and as the primary medical caregivers for sailors while underway. Hospital corpsmen are frequently the only medical care-giver available in many fleet or Marine units on extended deployment. In addition, hospital corpsmen perform duties as assistants in the prevention and treatment of disease and injury and assist health care professionals in providing medical care to sailors and their families. They may function as clinical or specialty technicians, medical administrative personnel and health care providers at medical treatment facilities. They also serve as battlefield corpsmen with the Marine Corps, rendering emergency medical treatment to include initial treatment in a combat environment. Qualified hospital corpsmen may be assigned the responsibility of independent duty aboard ships and submarines; Fleet Marine Force, SEAL and seabee units, and at isolated duty stations where no medical officer is available. Hospital corpsmen were previously trained at Naval Hospital Corps School, Great Lakes, Illinois, and the U.S. Naval Hospital Corps School San Diego, California, until the 2011 Base Realignment and Closure Bill caused Hospital Corps School to be relocated to the Medical Education and Training Campus (METC) at Joint Base San Antonio, Texas. Naval Hospital Corps School was also located at NRMC Balboa in San Diego, California. During the Vietnam War, many of the 16-week Naval Hospital Corps school graduates went directly to 8404 Field Medical Service School (FMSS) at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, or Camp Pendleton, California, for nine weeks of field training, before deployment to a Marine Corps unit in South Vietnam. The colloquial form of address for a hospital corpsman is \\"Doc\\". In the United States Marine Corps, this term is generally used as a sign of respect. ==History== Hospital steward's service coat, U.S. Navy Hospital Corps, 1898 Prior to the establishment of the hospital corps, enlisted medical support in the U.S. Navy was limited in scope. In the Continental Navy and the early U.S. Navy, medical assistants were assigned at random out of the ship's company. Their primary duties were to keep the irons hot and buckets of sand at the ready for the operating area. It was commonplace during battle for the surgeons to conduct amputations and irons were used to close lacerations and wounds. Sand was used to keep the surgeon from slipping on the bloody ship deck. Previously, corpsmen were commonly referred to as loblolly boys, a term borrowed from the Royal Navy, and a reference to the daily ration of porridge fed to the sick. The nickname was in common use for so many years that it was finally officially recognized by the Navy Regulations of 1814. In coming decades, the title of the enlisted medical assistant would change several times—from loblolly boy, to nurse (1861), and finally to bayman (1876). A senior enlisted medical rating, surgeon's steward, was introduced in 1841 and remained through the civil war. Following the war, the title surgeon's steward was abolished in favor of apothecary, a position requiring completion of a course in pharmacy. A hospital corpsman draws blood from a patient as part of his duties as an independent duty corpsman A corpsman takes a patient's temperature in 2006 Still, there existed pressure to reform the enlisted component of the Navy's medical department—medicine as a science was advancing rapidly, foreign navies had begun training medically skilled sailors, and the U.S. Army had established an enlisted hospital corps in 1887. Navy Surgeon General J.R. Tryon and subordinate physicians lobbied the Navy administration to take action. With the Spanish–American War looming, Congress passed a bill authorizing establishment of the U.S. Navy Hospital Corps, signed into law by President William McKinley on 17 June 1898. Three ratings were created therein—hospital apprentice, hospital apprentice first class (a petty officer third class), and hospital steward, which was a chief petty officer. A revision in 1916 established a new rate structure. With the introduction of a second junior rate there were now hospital apprentice second class (HA2c) and hospital apprentice first class (HA1c). The rating title for petty officers was established as pharmacist's mate (PhM), following the pattern of some of the Navy's other ratings (boatswain's mate, gunner's mate, etc.). Pharmacist's mate third class (PhM3c), second class (PhM2c), and first class (PhM1c) were now the petty officers, and chief pharmacist's mate (CPhM) was the chief petty officer. This structure remained in place until 1947. A total of 684 personal awards were awarded to hospital corpsmen, including 23 Medals of Honor, 55 Navy Crosses, and 237 Silver Stars. During World War I, hospital corpsmen served throughout the fleet, earning particular distinction on the Western Front with the Marine Corps. In the United States Navy in World War II, hospital corpsmen assigned to Marine units made beach assaults with the marines in every battle in the Pacific. Corpsmen also served on thousands of ships and submarines.Albert E. Cowdrey, Fighting for Life: American Military Medicine in World War II (1994), pp 51-72. Three unassisted emergency appendectomies were performed by hospital corpsmen serving undersea and beyond hope of medical evacuation. The hospital corps has the distinction of being the only corps in the U.S. Navy to be commended, in a famous speech by Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal after the conclusion of the war. A Fleet Marine Force corpsman treats a patient at the Battle of Naktong Bulge in Korea, in 1950 Following the war, the hospital corps changed its rating title to the generic term it had used all along—hospital corpsman. The rates of hospital corpsman third class (HM3), second class (HM2), and first class (HM1), and chief hospital corpsman (HMC) were supplemented by senior chief hospital corpsman (HMCS) and master chief hospital corpsman (HMCM) in 1958. Hospital corpsmen continued to serve at sea and ashore, and accompanied marines and Marine units into battle during the Korean and Vietnam wars. Fifteen hospital corpsmen were counted among the dead following the bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983. Hospital corpsmen also served in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars providing corpsmen for convoys, patrols, and hospital or clinic treatment. Whether they are assigned to hospital ships, reservist installations, recruiter offices, or Marine Corps combat units, the rating of hospital corpsman is the most decorated in the United States Navy and the most decorated job in the U.S. military, with 22 Medals of Honor, 179 Navy Crosses since World War I, 31 Navy Distinguished Service Medals, 959 Silver Stars, and more than 1,600 Bronze Star Medal's with combat V's for heroism, since World War II (As of 2016). Twenty naval ships have been named after hospital corpsmen. Prior to selection to the command master chief program, the 11th MCPON, Joe R. Campa, was a hospital corpsman. On September 29, 2016, the Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus terminated the corpsman rating along with all other U.S. Navy enlisted ratings. However, in late December 2016, the usage of ratings were restored by the Navy after much backlash by many of the enlisted naval ranks. ==Navy and Marine Corps training== Bermuda Regiment corporal and U.S. Navy corpsman at USMCB Camp Lejeune, 1994. The corpsman is assigned to the Bermuda Regiment from her station at the infirmary on U.S. NAS Bermuda. Bermuda Regiment medics and U.S. Navy corpsmen at Camp Lejeune in May 2011. As of April 2011, training to become a hospital corpsman began at Basic Medical Technician Corpsman Program (BMTCP) located at Joint Base Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. Because of the need for hospital corpsmen in a vast array of foreign, domestic, and shipboard duty stations, as well as with United States Marine Corps units, the hospital corps is the largest occupational rating (Navy Enlisted Classification-HM) in the United States Navy, with about 25,000 members active duty and reserve. The basic training for hospital corpsmen is conducted at the Medical Education and Training Campus, located in Texas at a joint military base. Originally one of the Navy's \\"A\\" schools (primary rating training). Upon graduation, the hospital corpsman is given the Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) code of HM-0000, or \\"quad-zero\\" in common usage. Students go through a 14-week course that provides in-depth and extensive training into the application of emergency medical techniques, disease and pathologies, and nursing techniques. NECs are not as analogous to MOS in the United States Army and Marine Corps, or AFSC in the Air Force as the rating in the Navy. There are primary NECs, and secondary NECs. For example, a hospital corpsman who completes Field Medical Training Battalion (FMTB) and earns the NEC HM-8404, moves that NEC to primary and has a secondary NEC of HM-0000. If that hospital corpsman attends a \\"C\\" School, then the NEC earned at the \\"C\\" School becomes their primary and HM-8404 becomes the secondary. Some hospital corpsmen go on to receive more specialized training in roles such as medical laboratory technician, optometry technician, radiology technician, aerospace medicine specialist, pharmacy technician, operating room technician, etc. This advanced education is done through \\"C\\" schools, which confer 39 additional NECs. Additionally, hospital corpsmen (E-5 and above) may attend independent duty corpsman training, qualifying for independent duty in surface ships and submarines, with diving teams, and Fleet Marine Force Recon teams, as well as at remote shore installations. In addition to advanced medical training, these hospital corpsmen receive qualification in sanitation and public health. Of note is the Field Medical Training Battalion (FMTB), with locations at Camp Del Mar and Camp Johnson, where sailors bound for service with USMC operating forces earn the NEC HM-8404, Field Medical Service Technician. FMTB provides specialized training in advanced emergency medicine and the fundamentals of Marine Corps life, while emphasizing physical conditioning, small arms familiarity, and basic battlefield tactics. , this rigorous training is 8 weeks. Training for the Fleet Marine Force (FMF) familiarizes navy corpsmen with the Marines. A bond and mutual respect is often formed between Marines and their assigned hospital corpsmen, earning respect apart from their Navy shipmates. FMF hospital corpsmen are issued the Marine Corps service uniforms and camouflage uniforms (MARPAT) while assigned to the Marine Corps and also have the option to go Marine Corps Regulations. They are then issued a new seabag containing the Marine uniforms (except dress blues) with uniform matching Navy rate chevrons instead of the Marine rank chevrons, and collar rank insignias, and wear those instead of traditional Navy uniforms. The Navy's new digitized camouflage working uniform are worn by sailors stationed at other naval facilities. Hospital corpsmen can further specialize; they may undergo further training to become Special Amphibious Reconnaissance Corpsmen, or SARC. They are usually found in both the FMF Recon, Marine Division Recon and MARSOC units. They are trained and skilled in combat, including combatant swimming, opened/closed circuit scuba diving, military free-fall and amphibious operations. They act as advisers regarding health and injury prevention, and treat illnesses from decompression sickness as well as other conditions requiring hyperbaric treatment. Two hospital corpsmen assigned to the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, treat a Marine wounded in Afghanistan in 2009. The corpsman on the right would later be awarded the Bronze Star Medal with Combat \\"V\\". Hospital corpsmen who have received the warfare designator of enlisted fleet marine force warfare specialist are highly trained members of the Hospital Corps who specialize in all aspects of working with the United States Marine Corps operating forces. Attainment of this designation is highly prized among all corpsmen. The enlisted fleet marine force warfare designation for hospital corpsmen is the only U.S. Navy warfare device awarded solely by a U.S. Marine Corps general officer. This awarding authority cannot be delegated to U.S. Navy officers. However, obtaining the title of \\"FMF\\" is a rigorous procedure and not every hospital corpsman who has been with a Marine Corps unit will wear the FMF warfare device. U.S. Navy officers in the medical community (Medical Corps (doctor), Nurse Corps, Dental Corps, Medical Service Corps) can earn and wear the officer equivalent to this insignia. Additionally any sailor attached to a USMC unit can earn and wear an FMF warfare device. (e.g., administrative rates such as logistic specialists) provided they complete all the qualifications for the FMF warfare specialist. The first physician assistants were selected from Navy corpsmen who had combat experience in Vietnam. They made up members of the first PA class at Duke University. The Navy trained its own physician assistants drawing from the ranks of qualified petty officer second class corpsman, as well as independent duty hospital corpsmen at the Naval School of Health Sciences in Portsmouth, VA until 1985, then at San Diego, CA and current the Interservice Physician Assistant Program (IPAP) with a university affiliation of the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC). It is conducted in two phases the first phase at the Graduate School and Academy of Health Sciences at AMEDDC&S;, Ft. Sam Houston, TX and the second phase at various medical facilities and specialties. When training completed they become officers in the Medical Service Corps (MSC). Former Navy hospital corpsmen are also represented in many medical disciplines, as physicians, nurses, medical administrators and other walks of life. After completing their training, a physician assistant is promoted to the rank of lieutenant junior grade (O-2). Previously after graduating from civilian PA school, they had only been given the rank of warrant officer 2 (CWO2). ==Rate/rating structure== *HR: Hospitalman Recruit (E-1) *HA: Hospitalman Apprentice (E-2) *HN: Hospitalman (E-3) (See USN apprenticeships) *HM3: Hospital Corpsman Third Class (E-4) *HM2: Hospital Corpsman Second Class (E-5) *HM1: Hospital Corpsman First Class (E-6) *HMC: Chief Hospital Corpsman (E-7) *HMCS: Senior Chief Hospital Corpsman (E-8) *HMCM: Master Chief Hospital Corpsman (E-9) ==Badges== Effective 2 April 1948 the Navy changed the names and insignia of the hospital corps. The new titles were Hospitalman Recruit, Hospitalman Apprentice, Hospitalman, Hospital Corpsman Third, Second, and First Class, and Chief Hospital Corpsman. The red Geneva cross, which had marked corpsmen for 50 years, was replaced in the rating badge with the misattributed mark of the winged caduceus. The rates of Senior Chief and Master Chief Hospital Corpsman were added in 1958. :See: ==Ships named in honor of hospital corpsmen== Reference: Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships *USS Benfold (DDG-65) *USS Caron (DD-970) *USS De Wert (FFG-45) *USS Durant (DER-389) *Also sailed as USCGC Durant (WDE-489) *USS Frament (APD-77) *USS Halyburton (FFG-40) *USS Francis Hammond (FF-1067) *USS Jobb (DE-707) *USS Daniel A.

Prior to this, there were no competent trained personnel to perform first aid aboard these vessels. The purser-corpsman was trained in anatomy, physiology, pharmacy, clinical laboratory, hygiene and sanitation, emergency treatment, first aid, and nursing. They were taught how to administer injections, treat compound fractures, administer blood plasma, and suture wounds. The Maritime Service’s Hospital Corps School was founded at the Sheepshead Bay Maritime Service Training Station on 7 December 1942. Surgeon S.S. Heilwell (R), United States Uniformed Public Health Service, was placed in charge of training. The course was taught over four months, with a 12-week period of didactic classroom experience and four weeks of practical experience at a Marine hospital. The original class of 331 students resulted in 239 graduates on 12 March 1943, but demand saw an increase in the class to 600 students, to cycle in 50 student classes starting on a weekly basis. Training stations were instructed to provide careful scrutiny by examining boards for all candidates. Pursers on sea duty started arriving at the station on 10 August 1943. By 1 January 1944, there were 600 purser-corpsmen at sea, with 1,324 graduates in the Maritime Service. Selection required an above average mark on the General Classification Test and interest in both administration and health care.Mast Magazine May 1944, August 1944, May 1945 ==See also== *68W (U.S. Army Combat Medic MOS code) * *Battlefield medicine *Combat medic *Combat Medical Technician (British Army) *Enlisted Medics (U.S. Air Force) *Fleet Marine Force *Fleet Marine Force insignia *Flight medic *Medical assistant *Medical Assistant (Royal Navy) *Military medicine *Medical Corps (United States Navy) *Nurse Corps (United States Navy) *Navy Medical Service Corps *Dental Corps (United States Navy) *Special Amphibious Reconnaissance Corpsman *Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen (SWCC) *Pharmacist's Mate First Class Wheeler Bryson Lipes ==References== ==Further reading== * Cowdrey, Albert E.

Military versions produce up to of thrust dry; afterburning variants can reach up to . The engine, depending upon additional equipment and specific model, weighs from . It is one of GE's most successful and longest in service military jet engines, with the civilian versions having logged over 16.5 million hours of operation. The United States Air Force plans to continue using the J85 in aircraft through 2040. Civilian models, known as the CJ610, are similar but supplied without an afterburner, while the CF700 adds a rear- mounted fan for improved fuel economy. ==Design and development== The J85 was originally designed to power a large decoy missile, the McDonnell ADM-20 Quail. The Quail was designed to be released from a B-52 Stratofortress in- flight and fly for long distances in formation with the launch aircraft, multiplying the number of targets facing the SA-2 surface-to-air missile operators on the ground. This mission demanded a small engine that could nevertheless provide enough power to keep up with the jet bomber. Like the similar Armstrong Siddeley Viper being built in England, the engine on a Quail drone had no need to last for extended periods of time, so therefore could be built of low-quality materials. The fit was a success on the Quail, but again like the Viper it was later built with normal grade materials and subsequently used to power small jet aircraft, including the Northrop T-38 Talon, Northrop F-5, Canadair CT-114 Tutor, and Cessna A-37 Dragonfly light attack aircraft. More recently, J85s have powered the Scaled Composites White Knight aircraft, the carrier for the Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne spacecraft, and the Me 262 Project. The basic engine design is quite small, about in diameter, and long. It features an eight-stage axial-flow compressor powered by two turbine stages, and is capable of generating up to of dry thrust, or more with an afterburner. At full throttle at sea level, this engine, without afterburner, consumes approximately of fuel per hour. At cruise altitude and power, it consumes approximately per hour. Several variants were produced. The J85-21 variant added a stage ahead of the base 8-stage compressor for a total of 9 stages, improving thrust. More than 12,000 J85 engines had been built by the time production ended in 1988. ===Iranian reverse engineering=== The Iranian Ministry of Defense constructed a new engine based on the General Electric J85 named \\"OWJ\\".

It stresses intensity, hard work, functional strength, power, endurance and mental toughness. Dinosaur training methodologies have been disseminated through the training manuals written by Brooks D. Kubik, although Bob Whelan, Ken Leistner, and John McCallum are counted as proponents of similar training methods. Historical lifters like Peary Rader and various late 19th-century and early 20th-century strongmen and physical culture proponents such as Eugen Sandow are regarded as being inspiration of dinosaur training styles. Kubik's book Dinosaur Training became highly acclaimed by the weight-lifting community. It offered simple yet effective routines, which were in stark contrast to complex routines offered by many authors within the fitness industry. Kubiks books are written in a motivational style, with an edge of humour. For a time Kubik advocated Dinosaur Training using bodyweight exercises, as described in his book Dinosaur Bodyweight Training (2006), using such exercises as pushups, handstand pushups, pullups, neck bridges, hanging leg raises, and two- and one-legged deep knee bends. In recent years however he has returned to writing about and advocating traditional weightlifting modes of training, using such exercises as squats, deadlifts, powercleans, high pulls, military presses, barbell bentover rows, benchpresses, etc. for low to moderate reps. Kubik elaborated further on the principles of Dinosaur training literally in a novel format in 2008's \\"Legacy of Iron,\\" which told the story of a young man being tutored in basic \\"old school\\" training and manhood by the lifters of York Barbell. The primary texts describing the Dinosaur Training philosophy are Dinosaur Training (1996; 2nd edition, 1998), written by Brooks D. Kubik; Dinosaur Bodyweight Training (2006), written by Brooks D. Kubik; and the Dinosaur Files newsletter, published by Kubik from August 1997 to August 2002, then resurrected, with revisions and updates, in 2006; and Legacy of Iron (2008), written by Brooks D.

Wolf is widely credited with bringing success to a Packers franchise that had rarely won during the two decades prior to Wolf joining the organization.http://www.profootballhof.com/enshrinement/2014/10/22/bill- polian-ron-wolf-selected-as-contributor-finalists-for-class-of-2015/ He also played a significant role in personnel operations with the Oakland and Los Angeles Raiders from 1963Ron Wolf's SCOUTING REPORT to 1975 and again from 1978 to 1990. He joined Green Bay's front office in November 1991 from a personnel director's job with the New York Jets. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in August 2015. ==BiographyEarly life=== Wolf was born in New Freedom, Pennsylvania on December 30, 1938. After serving three years in the Army, Wolf played college baseball at Maryville College in Tennessee. After college, he worked for Pro Football Illustrated, a Chicago sports newspaper. ===Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders=== Wolf became a scout for the Raiders in 1963. With the Raiders, Wolf took part in drafting such notable players as Art Shell, Gene Upshaw, Ken Stabler, and Jack Tatum, all of whom would play for the Super Bowl XI Championship team in 1976, and later such players as Howie Long, Marcus Allen, and Matt Millen, all of the Super Bowl XVIII Championship team in 1983, the then Los Angeles Raiders. After the death of Raiders owner Al Davis, Wolf was rumored to possibly come back to Oakland. He didn't specify that he wanted to have a full-time job as General Manager there, but he told the new ownership team that he would assist them with anything they needed. In an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel he supported Green Bay Packers director of football operations, Reggie McKenzie as a perfect candidate for the GM position in Oakland and called him a \\"tremendous evaluator\\" when it comes to finding players. ===Tampa Bay Buccaneers=== In 1975, Wolf joined the expansion Tampa Bay Buccaneers as vice- president of operations. He helped build the team that would advance to the 1979 NFC Championship game. He would not be around to see his team develop, however, as he resigned his position with the Buccaneers in February, 1978, citing \\"personal matters\\".\\"Sports in Brief\\". Spokane Daily Chronicle. 23 Feb 1978 It is believed that he had difficulty working with Buccaneer owner Hugh Culverhouse, and that Culverhouse was trying to interfere with personnel decisions.Mizell, Hubert. \\"Rams, Oilers eager to trade for Bucs' No. 1\\". St. Petersburg Times. 20 Apr 1978 Wolf later indicated that Culverhouse's close personal relationship with and strong financial stake in coach John McKay meant that Wolf had to be the one to pay with his job for the team's 0-26 start.Crawford, Denis. \\"The end of John McKay's coaching days in Tampa\\". bucpower.com. Nov 2009. accessed 6 Feb 2010 Wolf returned to the Raiders on the expiration of his Buccaneer contract. ===Green Bay Packers=== In 1991, Wolf was hired to replace Packers General Manager Tom Braatz. Wolf's first major decisions were to fire head coach Lindy Infante, hire then-San Francisco 49ers offensive coordinator Mike Holmgren to replace him, and to trade for then-Atlanta Falcons backup quarterback Brett Favre. In 1993, Wolf signed the most sought after free-agent available, Reggie White, bringing in a team leader and defensive superstar. This signing, in NFL free agency's first year, also made Green Bay a more desirable destination for future potential free agents, including White's fellow defensive linemen Santana Dotson and Sean Jones. Specifically, White's arrival negated the perception of Green Bay as a city where African-American players did not feel welcome.Christi, Cliff. \\"White's signing changed Packers' fortunes\\". espn.com. 27 Dec 2004. accessed 6 Feb 2010. With White and cast-off Gilbert Brown, Dotson and Jones formed the heart of the Packer defense during the team's championship run. Wolf is credited with remaking the Packers into a perennial winner and championship contender. From 1968 to 1991, the Packers had only four winning seasons.https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/gnb/ Over his nine-year term as GM, the Packers compiled a 92-52 record,Team/Staff/Ron Wolf PACKERS.COM good for a .639 winning percentage, second in the NFL over that span to the San Francisco 49ers. The Packers won Super Bowl XXXI against the New England Patriots, lost in Super Bowl XXXII to the Denver Broncos, and made the playoffs six straight times. Wolf announced he would retire as Packers GM in February 2001. He stayed on through the April NFL draft and officially retired as Packers GM in June 2001. Afterward the Packers head coach at that time, Mike Sherman, assumed his duties as GM. His son, Eliot Wolf, served as the Cleveland Browns' assistant general manager position from 2018 to 2019. ===San Diego Chargers=== On December 31, 2012, San Diego Chargers President Dean Spanos retained Wolf as a consultant to advise the Chargers throughout the general manager and head coach hiring process.Public Relations, www.chargers.com. \\"Chargers Begin Process, Retain Ron Wolf as Consultant\\" ===New York Jets=== From 1990 to 1991, Wolf served as personnel director for the New York Jets.

It is in the ancient Campus Martius. The name of the square comes from the Torre Argentina, which takes its name from the city of Strasbourg whose Latin name was Argentoratum. In 1503, the Papal Master of Ceremonies Johannes Burckardt, who came from Strasbourg and was known as \\"Argentinus\\", built in via del Sudario a palace (now at number 44), called Casa del Burcardo, to which the tower is annexed. The other tower in the square is the medieval Torre del Papito (\\"Little Pope's Tower\\"), attributed by tradition to Antipope Anacletus II Pierleoni, allegedly not a tall person. After Italian unification, it was decided to reconstruct part of Rome (1909), demolishing the zone of Torre Argentina. However, during the demolition work in 1927, the colossal head and arms of a marble statue were discovered. The archeological investigation brought to light the presence of a holy area, dating to the Republican era, with four temples and part of Pompey's Theatre. Julius Caesar was assassinated in the Curia of Pompey's Theatre, and the spot where he is believed to have been assassinated is in the square. The Mayor of Rome, Virginia Raggi, announced in February 2019 that by late 2021 the site will be installed with walkways and the general public will be able to tour the ruins for the first time. == Roman temples == Temple A or Temple of Juturna Temple B, dedicated to Fortuna Huiusce Diei The four temples, originally designated by the letters A, B, C, and D, front onto a paved street, which was reconstructed in the imperial era, after the fire of AD 80. The area was delineated to the North by the Hecatostylum (one-hundred columns porch) and the Baths of Agrippa, and to the South by the buildings related to the Circus Flaminius, to the East by the great porched square of Porticus Minucia Frumentaria, and to the West by the Theatre of Pompey. Temple A was built in the 3rd century BC, and is probably the Temple of Juturna built by Gaius Lutatius Catulus after his victory against the Carthaginians in 241 BC.This identification is preferred over the one as Temple of Iuno Curritis, because Ovid (Fasti I) says: \\"Te quoque lux eadem Turni soror aede recepit/Hic, ubi Virginea Campus obitur aqua\\", thus posing the temple of Juturna near the Aqua Virgo, which ended at the Baths of Agrippa. It was later rebuilt as a church, the apse of which is still present. Temple B, a circular temple (tholos) with six columns remaining, was built by Quintus Lutatius Catulus in 101 BC in fulfillment of his vow at the Battle of Vercellae.G. Marchetti-Longhi, \\"Gli scavi del Largo Argentina: II Tempio B,\\" BullCom 76 (1956- 58): 45-118 The temple (aedes) was devoted to Fortuna Huiusce Diei, \\"the Fortune of This Day.\\" The colossal statue found during excavations and now kept in the Centrale Montemartini of the Capitoline Museums was the statue of the goddess herself. Only the head, the arms, and the legs were made of marble: the other parts, covered by the dress, were of other materials, probably a wooden frame. This is known as an acrolithic statue. Temple C is the most ancient of the four, dating back to 4th or 3rd century BC, and was probably devoted to Feronia the ancient Italic goddess of fertility. After the fire of A.D. 80, this temple was restored, and the white and black mosaic of the inner temple cella dates back to this restoration. Map of the archaeological area Temple D is the largest of the four, dates back to the 2nd century BC with Late Republican restorations, and was devoted to Lares Permarini (Lares who protect sailors), but only a small part of it has been excavated (a street covers the most of it). It was vowed by the praetor, Lucius Aemilius Regillus, while engaged in a naval battle with the fleet of Antiochus the Great in 190 BC, and dedicated by M.

Although the 1492 and 1497 expulsions of unconverted Jews from Spain and Portugal were separate events from the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions (which was established over a decade earlier in 1478), they were ultimately linked, as the Inquisition eventually also led to the fleeing out of Iberia of many descendants of Jewish converts to Catholicism in subsequent generations. Despite the fact that the original Edicts of Expulsion did not apply to Jewish-origin New Christian conversos —as these were now legally Christians— the discriminatory practices that the Inquisition nevertheless placed upon them, which were often lethal, put immense pressure on many of the Jewish-origin Christians to also emigrate out of Spain and Portugal in the immediate generations following the expulsion of their unconverted Jewish brethren. The Alhambra Decree (also known as the Edict of Expulsion) was an edict issued on 31 March 1492, by the joint Catholic Monarchs of Spain (Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon) ordering the expulsion of all unconverted practicing Jews from the Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon, including from all its territories and possessions, by 31 July of that year.\\"Edict of the Expulsion of the Jews (1492)\\" The primary purpose of the expulsion was to eliminate the influence of unconverted Jews on Spain's by then large Jewish-origin New Christian converso population, to ensure that the prior did not encourage the latter to relapse and revert to Judaism. Over half of Spain's Jewish origin population had converted to Catholicism as a result of the religious anti-Jewish persecution and pogroms which occurred in 1391. As a result of the Alhambra decree and persecution in prior years, it is estimated that of Spain's total Jewish origin population at the time, over 200,000 Jews converted to Catholicism, and initially remained in Spain. Between 40,000 and 80,000 did not convert to Catholicism, and by their steadfast commitment to remain Jewish were thus expelled. Of those who were expelled as unconverted Jews, an indeterminate number nonetheless converted to Catholicism once outside Spain and eventually returned to Spain in the years following the expulsion due to the hardships many experienced in their resettlement. Many of Spain's Jews who left Spain as Jews also initially moved to Portugal, where they were subsequently forcibly converted to the Catholic Church in 1497. Most of the Jews who left Spain as Jews accepted the hospitality of Sultan Bayezid II and, after the Alhambra Decree, moved to the Ottoman Empire, where they founded communities openly practising the Jewish religion; they and their descendants are known as Eastern Sephardim. During the centuries following the Spanish and Portuguese decrees, some of the Jewish-origin New Christian conversos started emigrating from Portugal and Spain, settling until the 1700s throughout areas of Western Europe and non- Iberian realms of the colonial Americas (mostly Dutch realms, including Curaçao in the Dutch West Indies, Recife in Dutch areas of colonial Brazil which eventually were regained by the Portuguese, and New Amsterdam which later became New York) forming communities and formally reverting to Judaism. It is the collective of these communities and their descendants who are known as Western Sephardim, and are the subject of this article. As the early members of the Western Sephardim consisted of persons who themselves (or whose immediate forebears) personally experienced an interim period as New Christians, which resulted in unceasing trials and persecutions of crypto- Judaism by the Portuguese and Spanish Inquisitions, the early community continued to be augmented by further New Christian emigration pouring out of the Iberian Peninsula in a continuous flow between the 1600s to 1700s. Jewish- origin New Christians were officially considered Christians due to their forced or coerced conversions; as such they were subject to the jurisdiction of the Catholic Church's Inquisitorial system, and were subject to harsh heresy and apostasy laws if they continued to practice their ancestral Jewish faith. Those New Christians who eventually fled both the Iberian cultural sphere and jurisdiction of the Inquisition were able to officially return to Judaism and open Jewish practice once they were in their new tolerant environments of refuge. As former conversos or their descendants, Western Sephardim developed a distinctive ritual based on the remnants of the Judaism of pre-expulsion Spain, which some had practiced in secrecy during their time as New Christians, and influenced by Judaism as practiced by the communities (including Sephardic Jews of the Ottoman Empire and Ashkenazi Jews) which assisted them in their readoption of normative Judaism; as well as by the Spanish-Moroccan and the Italian Jewish rites practiced by rabbis and hazzanim recruited from those communities to instruct them in ritual practice. A part of their distinctiveness as a Jewish group, furthermore, stems from the fact that they saw themselves as forced to \\"redefine their Jewish identity and mark its boundaries [...] with the intellectual tools they had acquired in their Christian socialization\\" during their time as New Christian conversos. ==Terminology== Painting of the Amsterdam Esnoga—considered the mother synagogue by the Spanish and Portuguese Jews—by Emanuel de Witte (ab. 1680). The main 'Western Sephardic Jewish' communities developed in Western Europe, Italy, and the non-Iberian regions of the Americas. In addition to the term \\"Western Sephardim\\", this sub-group of Sephardic Jews is sometimes also referred to also as \\"Spanish and Portuguese Jews,\\" \\"Spanish Jews,\\" \\"Portuguese Jews,\\" or \\"Jews of the Portuguese Nation.\\" The term \\"Western Sephardim\\" is frequently used in modern research literature to refer to \\"Spanish and Portuguese Jews,\\" but sometimes also to \\"Spanish-Moroccan Jews\\". The use of the terms \\"Portuguese Jews\\" and \\"Jews of the Portuguese Nation\\" in areas such as the Netherlands, Hamburg, Scandinavia, and at one time in London, seems to have arisen primarily as a way for the \\"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\\" to distance themselves from Spain in the times of political tension and war between Spain and the Netherlands in the 17th century. Similar considerations may have played a role for ethnic Sephardic Jews in the French regions of Bayonne and Bordeaux, given their proximity to the Spanish border. Another reason for the terminology of \\"Portuguese\\" Jews may have been that a relatively high proportion of the families in question had Portugal as their immediate point of departure from the Iberian peninsula, regardless of whether the remoter family background was nonetheless Spanish, since Portugal was the first place of refuge and transit point for many Spanish Jews immediately following their expulsion from Spain. As the term \\"Sephardim\\" (when used in its ethnic sense) necessarily connotes a link with Spain, the distinguishing feature of the Western subgroup was the added link with Portugal. Thus, as a subset of the Sephardim, \\"Portuguese\\" and \\"Spanish and Portuguese\\" could be used interchangeably. Finally, almost all organised communities in this group traditionally employed Portuguese rather than Spanish as their official or working language. In Italy, the term \\"Spanish Jews\\" (Ebrei Spagnoli) is frequently used, but it includes descendants of Jews expelled as Jews from the Kingdom of Naples, as well as \\"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\\" proper (i.e. Jews descended from former conversos and their descendants). In Venice, Spanish and Portuguese Jews were often described as \\"Ponentine\\" (Western), to distinguish them from \\"Levantine\\" (Eastern) Sephardim from Eastern Mediterranean areas. Occasionally Italian Jews distinguish between the \\"Portuguese Jews\\" of Pisa and Livorno and the \\"Spanish Jews\\" of Venice, Modena and elsewhere. The scholar Joseph Dan distinguishes \\"medieval Sephardim\\" (15th and 16th-century Spanish exiles in the Ottoman Empire who arrived as Jews) from \\"Renaissance Sephardim\\" (Spanish and Portuguese former converso communities who arrived as New Christians), in reference to the respective times of each grouping's formative contacts with Spanish language and culture. === Relation to other Sephardi communities === The term Sephardi means \\"Spanish\\" or \\"Hispanic\\", and is derived from Sepharad, a Biblical location. The location of the biblical Sepharad is disputed, but Sepharad was identified by later Jews as Hispania, that is, the Iberian Peninsula. Sepharad still means \\"Spain\\" in modern Hebrew. The relationship between Sephardi-descended communities is illustrated in the following diagram: \\"Sephardim\\" properly refers to all Jews whose families have extended histories in Spain and Portugal, in contrast to Ashkenazi Jews and all other Jewish ethnic divisions. However, Mizrahi Jews, who have extended histories in the Greater Middle East and North Africa, are often called \\"Sephardim\\" more broadly in colloquial and religious parlance due to similar styles of liturgy and a certain amount of intermarriage between them and Sephardim proper. The main factor distinguishing \\"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\\" (Western Sephardim) from other \\"Sephardim proper\\" is that \\"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\\" refers specifically to those Jews who descend from persons whose history as practising members of Jewish communities with origins in the Iberian peninsula was interrupted by a period of having been New Christians (also known as conversos, the Spanish and Portuguese term for \\"converts\\" to Catholicism) or anusim (Hebrew for those \\"forced\\" to convert from Judaism to another faith). During their period as New Christians, many conversos continued to practise their Jewish faith in secrecy as best they could. Those New Christian conversos of Jewish origin who maintained crypto-Jewish practices in secret were termed marranos (Spanish \\"swine\\") by Old Christian Spaniards and Portuguese. Conversely, those New Christian conversos who have remained as conversos since that time, both those in the Iberian Peninsula and those who moved to the Iberian colonial possessions during the Spanish colonization of the Americas, became the related Sephardic Bnei Anusim. Sephardic Bnei Anusim are the contemporary and largely nominally Christian descendants of assimilated 15th century Sephardic Anusim, and are today a fully assimilated sub-group within the Iberian-descended Christian populations of Spain, Portugal, Hispanic America and Brazil. For historical reasons and circumstances, Sephardic Bnei Ansuim have not returned to the Jewish faith over the last five centuries, In modern times, some have begun emerging publicly in increasing numbers, especially in the last two decades. For \\"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\\" (Western Sephardim), their historical period as conversos has shaped their identity, culture, and practices. In this respect, they are clearly distinguishable from those Sephardim who descend from the Jews who left Iberia as Jews before the expiration date for the Alhambra Decree, resulting in the 1492 expulsion from Spain and 1497 expulsion from Portugal of all Jews who had not been baptised into the Catholic faith. These expelled Jews settled mainly around the Mediterranean Basin of Southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, namely, Salonika, the Balkans and Turkey, and they became the Eastern Sephardim and North African Sephardim respectively. For centuries, the Sephardic Jewish communities under Ottoman rule provided spiritual leadership to the dispersed Sephardim through their contributions to the Responsa literature. These Sephardic communities offered refuge to all Jews, including the Sephardi Jewish-origin New Christian conversos fleeing the Inquisition across Europe, as well as their Eastern European Ashkenazi coreligionists fleeing pogroms.  Relation to Sephardic Bnei Anusim and Neo-Western Sephardim  The common feature shared by Western Sephardim (\\"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\\") to Sephardic Bnei Anusim and Neo-Western Sephardim is that all three are descended from conversos. \\"Western Sephardim\\" are descendants of former conversos of earlier centuries; \\"Sephardic Bnei Anusim\\" are the still nominally Christian descendants of conversos; and \\"Neo-Western Sephardim\\" are the increasing in number modern-day former conversos currently returning to Judaism from among the Sephardic Bnei Anusim population. The distinguishing factor between \\"Western Sephardim\\" and the nascent \\"Neo-Western Sephardim\\" is the time frame of the reversions to Judaism, the location of the reversions, and the precarious religious and legal circumstances surrounding their reversions, including impediments and persecutions. Thus, the converso descendants who became the Western Sephardim had reverted to Judaism between the 16th and 18th centuries, they did so at a time before the abolition of the Inquisition in the 19th century, and this time frame necessitated their migration out of the Iberian cultural sphere. Conversely, the converso descendants who are today becoming the nascent Neo- Western Sephardim have been reverting to Judaism between the late 20th and early 21st centuries, they have been doing so at a time after the abolition of the Inquisition in the 19th century, and this time frame has not necessitated their migration out of the Iberian cultural sphere. Although Jewish communities were re-established in Spain and Portugal in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, largely with the help of communities of Spanish and Portuguese Jews such as that in London, these present-day Jews in Portugal and Jews in Spain are distinct from \\"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\\" as, for the most part, the modern Jewish communities resident in Spain and Portugal also include other Jewish ethnic divisions recently immigrated to Spain and Portugal, such as Ashkenazi Jews of Northern Europe. In modern Iberia, practicing Jews of Sephardic origins, such as the Jewish community of Oporto, however, are also not Western Sephardim, but are Neo-Western Sephardim, as they were re-established in the 20th century and early 21st centuries with a campaign of outreach to the crypto-Jews of Sephardic Bnei Anusim origins. The Oporto community's return to Judaism was led by the returnee to Judaism Captain Artur Carlos de Barros Basto (1887–1961), known also as the \\"apostle of the Marranos\\". In 1921, realizing that there were less than twenty Ashkenazi Jews living in Porto, and that recent returnees to Judaism like himself were not organized and had to travel to Lisbon for religious purposes whenever necessary, Barros Basto began to think about building a synagogue and took initiative in 1923 to officially register the Jewish Community of Porto and the Israelite Theological Center in the city council of Porto. As mentioned, these communities of modern-day returnees to Judaism are among the first in the emergence of the nascent Neo-Western Sephardim. Neo-Western Sephardim are the modern returnees to Judaism throughout Iberia and Ibero- America emerging from among the population of Sephardic Bnei Anusim, and are distinct from Western Sephardim (those termed \\"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\\"). Even more recent examples of such Neo-Western Sephardim communities include the Belmonte Jews in Portugal, and the Xuetes of Spain. In the case of the Xuetes, the entire community of converso descendants was extended a blanket recognition as Jews by Rabbinical authorities in Israel due to their particular historical circumstances on the island which effectively resulted in a strict social isolation of the Xuetes imposed upon them by their non- Jewish-descended neighbors up until modern times.\\"Chuetas of Majorca recognized as Jewish\\"; The Jerusalem Post 07/12/2011 In the last five to ten years, \\"organized groups of [Sephardic] Benei Anusim have been established in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and in Sefarad [the Iberian Peninsula] itself\\". have also now been established. Some members of these communities have formally reverted to Judaism. ==HistoryIn Spain and Portugal=== Spanish and Portuguese Jews were originally descended from New Christian conversos (i.e. Jews converted to Roman Catholic Christianity) whose descendants later left the Iberian peninsula and reverted to Judaism. Although legend has it that conversos existed as early as the Visigothic period, and that there was a continuous phenomenon of crypto-Judaism from that time lasting throughout Spanish history, this scenario is unlikely, as in the Muslim period of Iberia there was no advantage in passing as a Christian instead of publicly acknowledging one was a Jew. The main wave of conversions, often forced, followed The Massacre of 1391 in Spain. Legal definitions of that era theoretically acknowledged that a forced baptism was not a valid sacrament, but the Church confined this to cases where it was literally administered by physical force: a person who had consented to baptism under threat of death or serious injury was still regarded as a voluntary convert, and accordingly forbidden to revert to Judaism.Raymond of Penyafort, Summa, lib. 1 p.33, citing D.45 c.5. Crypto- Judaism as a large-scale phenomenon mainly dates from that time. Conversos, whatever their real religious views, often (but not always) tended to marry and associate among themselves. As they achieved prominent positions in trade and in the Royal administration, they attracted considerable resentment from the \\"Old Christians\\". The ostensible reason given for issuance of the 1492 Alhambra Decree for the conversion, expulsion or execution of the unconverted Jews from Spain was that the unconverted Jews had supported the New Christian conversos in the crypto-Jewish practices of the latter, thus delaying or preventing their assimilation into the Christian community. After the issuance of Spain's Alhambra Decree in 1492, a large proportion of the unconverted Jews chose exile rather than conversion, many of them crossing the border to Portugal. In Portugal, however, the Jews were again issued with a similar decree just a few years later in 1497, giving them the choice of exile or conversion. Unlike in Spain, however, in actual practice Portugal mostly prevented them from leaving, thus they necessarily stayed as ostensible converts to Christianity whether they wished to or not, after the Portuguese King reasoned that by their failure to leave they accepted Christianity by default. For this reason, crypto-Judaism was far more prevalent in Portugal than in Spain, even though many of these families were originally of Spanish rather than Portuguese descent. Over time, however, most crypto-Jews both of Spanish and Portuguese ancestry had left Portugal by the 18th century. Crypto-Judaism Burning of Crypto-Jews in Lisbon, Portugal, 1497 Scholars are still divided on the typical religious loyalties of the conversos, in particular on whether they are appropriately described as \\"crypto-Jews\\". Given the secrecy surrounding their situation, the question is not easy to answer: probably the conversos themselves were divided, and could be ranged at different points between the possible positions. The suggested profiles are as follows: #Sincere Christians, who were still subject to discrimination and accusations of Judaizing on the part of the Inquisition; some of these appealed to the Pope and sought refuge in the Papal States. #Those who had honestly tried their best to live as Christians, but who, on finding that they were still not accepted socially and still suspected of Judaizing, conceived intellectual doubts on the subject and decided to try Judaism, on the reasoning that suspicion creates what it suspects.An extreme rather than a typical example is Uriel da Costa. #Genuine crypto-Jews, who regarded their conversions as forced on them and reluctantly conformed to Catholicism until they found the first opportunity of living an open Jewish life.This is the view of them taken in the rabbinic Responsa of the period. #Opportunistic \\"cultural commuters\\" whose private views may have been quite sceptical and who conformed to the local form of Judaism or Christianity depending on where they were at the time. For these reasons, there was a continuous flow of people leaving Spain and Portugal (mostly Portugal) for places where they could practise Judaism openly, from 1492 until the end of the 18th century. They were generally accepted by the host Jewish communities as anusim (forced converts), whose conversion, being involuntary, did not compromise their Jewish status. Conversos of the first generation after the expulsion still had some knowledge of Judaism based on memory of contact with a living Jewish community. In later generations, people had to avoid known Jewish practices that might attract undesired attention: conversos in group 3 evolved a home-made Judaism with practices peculiar to themselves, while those in group 2 had a purely intellectual conception of Judaism based on their reading of ancient Jewish sources preserved by the Church such as the Vulgate Old Testament, the Apocrypha, Philo and Josephus. Both groups therefore needed extensive re-education in Judaism after reaching their places of refuge outside the peninsula. This was achieved with the help of *Sephardim living in Italy (and to a lesser extent, Italian Jews proper); *1492 exiles living in Morocco, who were the immediate heirs of the Andalusi Jewish tradition; *especially in Holland and Germany, Ashkenazi Jews. Ceuta and Melilla There are still Jewish communities in the North African exclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. These places, though treated in most respects as integral parts of Spain, escaped the Inquisition and the expulsion, so these communities regard themselves as the remnant of pre-expulsion Spanish Jewry. ===In Italy=== As Sephardic Jewish communities were established in central and northern Italy, following the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492 and from the Kingdom of Naples in 1533, these areas were an obvious destination for conversos wishing to leave Spain and Portugal. The similarity of the Italian language to Spanish was another attraction. Given their Christian cultural background and high level of European-style education, the new emigrants were less likely to follow the example of the 1492 expellees by settling in the Ottoman Empire, where a complete culture change would be required.See also History of the Jews in Thessaloniki#Economic decline. On the other hand, in Italy they ran the risk of prosecution for Judaizing, given that in law they were baptized Christians; for this reason they generally avoided the Papal States. The Popes did allow some Spanish-Jewish settlement at Ancona, as this was the main port for the Turkey trade, in which their links with the Ottoman Sephardim were useful. Other states found it advantageous to allow the conversos to settle and mix with the existing Jewish communities, and to turn a blind eye to their religious status. In the next generation, the children of conversos could be brought up as fully Jewish with no legal problem, as they had never been baptized. The main places of settlement were as follows: #The Republic of Venice often had strained relations with the Papacy. They were also alive to the commercial advantages offered by the presence of educated Spanish-speaking Jews, especially for the Turkey trade. Previously the Jews of Venice were tolerated under charters for a fixed term of years, periodically renewed. In the early 16th century, these arrangements were made permanent, and a separate charter was granted to the \\"Ponentine\\" (western) community. Around the same time, the state required the Jews to live in the newly established Venetian Ghetto. Nevertheless for a long time the Venetian Republic was regarded as the most welcoming state for Jews, equivalent to the Netherlands in the 17th century or the United States in the 20th century. #Sephardic immigration was also encouraged by the House of Este in their possessions of Reggio, Modena and Ferrara. In 1598 Ferrara was repossessed by the Papal States, leading to some Jewish emigration from there. #In 1593, Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, granted Spanish and Portuguese Jews charters to live and trade in Pisa and Livorno. On the whole, the Spanish and Portuguese Jews remained separate from the native Italian rite Jews, though there was considerable mutual religious and intellectual influence between the groups. In a given city, there was often an \\"Italian synagogue\\" and a \\"Spanish synagogue\\", and occasionally a \\"German synagogue\\" as well. Many of these synagogues have since merged, but the diversity of rites survived in modern Italy. The Spanish Synagogue (Scola Spagnola) of Venice was originally regarded as the \\"mother synagogue\\" for the Spanish and Portuguese community worldwide, as it was among the earliest to be established, and the first prayer book was published there. Later communities, such as in Amsterdam, followed its lead on ritual questions. With the decline in the importance of Venice in the 18th century, the leading role passed to Livorno (for Italy and the Mediterranean) and Amsterdam (for western countries). Unfortunately, the Livorno synagogue – considered to be the most important building in town – was destroyed in the Second World War: a modern building was erected on the same site in 1958–1962. Many merchants maintained a presence in both Italy and countries in the Ottoman Empire, and even those who settled permanently in the Ottoman Empire retained their Tuscan or other Italian nationality, so as to have the benefit of the capitulations of the Ottoman Empire. Thus, in Tunisia there was a community of Juifs Portugais, or L'Grana (Livornese), separate from, and regarding itself as superior to, the native Tunisian Jews (Tuansa). Smaller communities of the same kind existed in other countries, such as Syria, where they were known as Señores Francos. They were generally not numerous enough to establish their own synagogues, instead meeting for prayer in each other's houses. ===In France=== In the 16th and early 17th centuries, conversos were also seeking refuge beyond the Pyrenees, settling in France at Saint-Jean-de-Luz, Tarbes, Bayonne, Bordeaux, Marseille, and Montpellier. They lived apparently as Christians; were married by Catholic priests; had their children baptized, and publicly pretended to be Catholics. In secret, however, they circumcised their children, kept Shabbat and feast-days as best they could and prayed together. Henry III of France confirmed the privileges granted them by Henry II of France, and protected them against accusations. Under Louis XIII of France, the conversos of Bayonne were assigned to the suburb of Saint-Esprit. At Saint-Esprit, as well as at Peyrehorade, Bidache, Orthez, Biarritz, and Saint-Jean-de-Luz, they gradually avowed Judaism openly. In 1640 several hundred conversos, considered to be Jews, were living at Saint-Jean-de-Luz; and a synagogue existed in Saint-Esprit as early as 1660. In pre-Revolutionary France, the Portuguese Jews were one of three tolerated Jewish communities, the other two being the Ashkenazi Jews of Alsace-Lorraine and the Jews of the former Papal enclave of Comtat Venaissin; all three groups were emancipated at the French Revolution. The third community originally had their own Provençal rite, but adopted the Spanish and Portuguese rite shortly after the French Revolution and the incorporation of Comtat Venaissin into France. Today there are still a few Spanish and Portuguese communities in Bordeaux and Bayonne, and one in Paris, but in all these communities (and still more among French Jews generally) any surviving Spanish and Portuguese Jews are greatly outnumbered by recent Sephardic migrants of North African origin. ===In the Netherlands=== During the Spanish occupation of the Netherlands, converso merchants had a strong trading presence there. When the Dutch Republic gained independence in 1581, the Dutch retained trading links with Portugal rather than Spain, as Spain was regarded as a hostile power. Since there were penal laws against Catholics,See Roman Catholicism in the Netherlands#History and Holland (Batavia) Mission. and Catholicism was regarded with greater hostility than Judaism, New Christian conversos (technically Catholics, as that was the Christian tradition they were forced into) were encouraged by the Dutch to \\"come out\\" openly as Jews. Given the multiplicity of Protestant sects, the Netherlands was the first country in the Western world to establish a policy of religious tolerance. This made Amsterdam a magnet for conversos leaving Portugal. There were originally three Sephardi communities: the first, Beth Jacob, already existed in 1610, and perhaps as early as 1602; Neve Shalom was founded between 1608 and 1612 by Jews of Spanish origin. The third community, Beth Israel, was established in 1618. These three communities began co-operating more closely in 1622. Eventually, in 1639, they merged to form Talmud Torah, the Portuguese Jewish Community of Amsterdam, which still exists today. The current Portuguese Synagogue, sometimes known as the \\"Amsterdam Esnoga\\", was inaugurated in 1675, of which Abraham Cohen Pimentel was the head Rabbi. At first the Dutch conversos had little knowledge of Judaism and had to recruit rabbis and hazzanim from Italy, and occasionally Morocco and Salonica, to teach them. Later on Amsterdam became a centre of religious learning: a religious college Ets Haim was established, with a copious Jewish and general library. This library still exists. The transactions of the college, mainly in the form of responsa, were published in a periodical, Peri Ets Haim (see links below). There were formerly several Portuguese synagogues in other cities such as The Hague. Since the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands and destruction of Jews in the Second World War, the Amsterdam synagogue is the only remaining synagogue of the Portuguese rite in the Netherlands. It serves a membership of about 600. The synagogue at the Hague survived the war undamaged: it is now the Liberal Synagogue and no longer belongs to the \\"Portuguese\\" community. The position of Jews in the Spanish Netherlands (modern Belgium) was rather different. Considerable numbers of conversos lived there, in particular in Antwerp. The Inquisition was not allowed to operate. Nevertheless their practice of Judaism remained under cover and unofficial, as acts of Judaizing in Belgium could expose one to proceedings elsewhere in the Spanish possessions. Sporadic persecutions alternated with periods of unofficial toleration. The position improved somewhat in 1713, with the cession of the southern Netherlands to Austria, but no community was officially formed until the 19th century. There is a Portuguese synagogue in Antwerp; its members, like those of the Sephardic rite synagogues of Brussels, are now predominantly of North African origin, and few if any pre-War families or traditions remain. ===In Germany, Northern Europe and Eastern Europe=== There were Portuguese Jews living in Hamburg as early as the 1590s. Records attest to their having a small synagogue called Talmud Torah in 1627, and the main synagogue, Beth Israel, was founded in 1652. From the 18th century on, the Portuguese Jews were increasingly outnumbered by \\"German Jews\\" (Ashkenazim). By 1900, they were thought to number only about 400. A small branch of the Portuguese community was located in Altona, with a congregation known as Neweh Schalom. Historically, however, the Jewish community of Altona was overwhelmingly Ashkenazi, as Altona belonged to the kingdom of Denmark, which permitted Jews of all communities to settle there when Hamburg proper still only admitted the Portuguese. Spanish and Portuguese Jews had an intermittent trading presence in Norway until the early 19th century, and were granted full residence rights in 1844. Today they have no separate organizational identity from the general (mainly Ashkenazi) Jewish community, though traditions survive in some families. Around 1550, many Sephardi Jews travelled across Europe to find their haven in Poland, which had the largest Jewish population in the whole of Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries. For this reason there are still Polish Jewish surnames with a possible Spanish origin. However, most of them quickly assimilated into the Ashkenazi community and retained no separate identity. ===In Britain=== There were certainly Spanish and Portuguese merchants, many of them conversos, in England at the time of Queen Elizabeth I; one notable marrano was the physician Roderigo Lopez. In the time of Oliver Cromwell, Menasseh Ben Israel led a delegation seeking permission for Dutch Sephardim to settle in England: Cromwell was known to look favourably on the request, but no official act of permission has been found. By the time of Charles II and James II, a congregation of Spanish and Portuguese Jews had a synagogue in Creechurch Lane. Both these kings showed their assent to this situation by quashing indictments against the Jews for unlawful assembly.Henriques, The Jews and the English Law. For this reason the Spanish and Portuguese Jews of England often cite 1656 as the year of re-admission, but look to Charles II as the real sponsor of their community. Bevis Marks Synagogue was opened in 1701 in London. In the 1830s and 40s there was agitation for the formation of a branch synagogue in the West End, nearer where most congregants lived, but rabbis refused this on the basis of Ascama 1, forbidding the establishment of other synagogues within six miles of Bevis Marks. Dissident congregants, together with some Ashkenazim, accordingly founded the West London Synagogue in Burton Street in 1841. An official branch synagogue in Wigmore Street was opened in 1853. This moved to Bryanston Street in the 1860s, and to Lauderdale Road in Maida Vale in 1896. A private synagogue existed in Islington from 1865 to 1884, and another in Highbury from 1885 to 1936. A third synagogue has been formed in Wembley. Over the centuries the community has absorbed many Sephardi immigrants from Italy and North Africa, including many of its rabbis and hazzanim. The current membership includes many Iraqi Jews and some Ashkenazim, in addition to descendants of the original families. The Wembley community is predominantly Egyptian. The synagogues at Bevis Marks, Lauderdale Road and Wembley are all owned by the same community, formally known as Sahar Asamaim (Sha'ar ha-Shamayim), and have no separate organisational identities. The community is served by a team rabbinate: the post of Haham, or chief rabbi, is currently vacant (and has frequently been so in the community's history), the current head being known as the \\"Senior Rabbi\\". The day-to-day running of the community is the responsibility of a Mahamad, elected periodically and consisting of a number of parnasim (wardens) and one gabbay (treasurer). . Under the current Senior Rabbi, Joseph Dweck, the name of the community has been changed from \\"Congregation of Spanish and Portuguese Jews\\" to \\"S&P; Sephardi Community\\".. In addition to the three main synagogues, there is the Montefiore Synagogue at Ramsgate associated with the burial place of Moses Montefiore. A synagogue in Holland Park is described as \\"Spanish and Portuguese\\" but serves chiefly Greek and Turkish Jews, with a mixed ritual: it is connected to the main community by a Deed of Association. The Manchester Sephardic synagogues are under the superintendence of the London community and traditionally used a predominantly Spanish and Portuguese ritual, which is giving way to a Jerusalem Sephardic style: the membership is chiefly Syrian in heritage, with some Turkish, Iraqi and North African Jews. The London community formerly had oversight over some Baghdadi synagogues in the Far East, such as the Ohel Leah Synagogue in Hong Kong and Ohel Rachel Synagogue in Shanghai. An informal community using the Spanish and Portuguese rite, and known as the \\"Rambam Synagogue\\", exists in Elstree and a further minyan has been established in Hendon. Newer Sephardic rite synagogues in London, mostly for Baghdadi and Persian Jews, preserve their own ritual and do not come under the Spanish and Portuguese umbrella. Like the Amsterdam community, the London Spanish and Portuguese community early set up a Medrash do Heshaim (Ets Haim). This is less a functioning religious college than a committee of dignitaries responsible for community publications, such as prayer books.Society of Heshaim, London In 1862 the community founded the \\"Judith Lady Montefiore College\\" in Ramsgate, for the training of rabbis. This moved to London in the 1960s: students at the College concurrently followed courses at Jews' College (now the London School of Jewish Studies). Judith Lady Montefiore College closed in the 1980s, but was revived in 2005 as a part-time rabbinic training programme run from Lauderdale Road, serving the Anglo-Jewish Orthodox community in general, Ashkenazim as well as Sephardim. The Third Cemetery of the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue, Congregation Shearith Israel (1829–1851) on West 21st Street in Manhattan, New York City is now surrounded by tall buildings ===In the Americas=== From the 16th to the 18th centuries, a majority of conversos leaving Portugal went to Brazil. This included economic emigrants with no interest in reverting to Judaism. As the Inquisition was active in Brazil as well as in Portugal, conversos still had to be careful. Dutch Sephardim were interested in colonisation, and formed communities in both Curaçao and Paramaribo, Suriname. Between 1630 and 1654, a Dutch colony existed in the north-east of Brazil, including Recife. This attracted both conversos from Portuguese Brazil and Jewish emigrants from Holland, who formed a community in Recife called Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue, the first synagogue in the Americas. On the reconquest of the Recife area by Portugal, many of these Jews (it is not known what percentage) left Brazil for new or existing communities in the Caribbean such as Curaçao. Others formed a new community, Congregation Shearith Israel, in New Amsterdam (later renamed as New York) in 1654, the first Jewish synagogue in what became the United States. Numerous conversos, however, stayed in Brazil. They survived by migrating to the countryside in the province of Paraíba and away from the reinstated Inquisition, which was mostly active in the major cities. In the Caribbean, there were at one point Spanish and Portuguese synagogues in various other Dutch- and English-controlled islands, such as Jamaica, St. Thomas, Barbados, St. Eustatius and Nevis. With the elimination of the Inquisition after the Spanish American wars of independence, which many Caribbean Sephardim had supported, many of these communities declined as Jews took advantage of their new-found freedom to move to the mainland, where there were better economic opportunities. Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Costa Rica and Honduras, among others, received numbers of Sephardim. Within a couple of generations, these immigrants mostly converted to Catholicism in order to better integrate into society. Only in Panama and Suriname did viable communities endure on the Central- and South- American mainland. In the 21st century among the Caribbean islands, only Curaçao and Jamaica still have communities of Spanish and Portuguese Jews. In Canada, at that time named as 'New France', Esther Brandeau was the first Jewish person to immigrate to Canada, in 1738, disguised as a Roman Catholic boy. She came from Saint-Esprit (Pyrénées-Atlantiques), a district of Bayonne, a port city in Southwestern France, were Spanish and Portuguese Jews had settled. In the British Thirteen Colonies, synagogues were formed before the American Revolution at Newport, Rhode Island and Philadelphia, as well as in cities of the southern colonies of South Carolina, Virginia, and Georgia. Since then, many of the former Sephardic synagogues in the southern states and the Caribbean have become part of the Conservative, Reform or Reconstructionist movements, and retain only a few Spanish and Portuguese traditions. Despite the Dutch origins of the New York community, by the 19th century all of the Spanish and Portuguese Jewish communities in the United States and Canada were very much part of the London-based family. The 19th and early 20th century editions of the prayer book published in London and Philadelphia contained the same basic text, and were designed for use on both sides of the Atlantic: for example, they all contained both a prayer for the Royal family and an alternative for use in republican states. The New York community continued to use these editions until the version of David de Sola Pool was published in 1954. On the other hand, in the first half of the 20th century, the New York community employed a series of hazzanim from Holland, with the result that the community's musical tradition remained close to that of Amsterdam. First Cemetery of the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue, Shearith Israel There are only two remaining Spanish and Portuguese synagogues in the United States: Shearith Israel in New York, and Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia. In both congregations, only a minority of their membership has Western Sephardic ancestry, with the remaining members a mix of Ashkenazim, Levantine Sephardim, Mizrahim, and converts. Newer Sephardic and Sephardic-rite communities, such as the Syrian Jews of Brooklyn and the Greek and Turkish Jews of Seattle, do not come under the Spanish and Portuguese umbrella. The Seattle community did use the de Sola Pool prayer books until the publication of Siddur Zehut Yosef in 2002. Sephardic Temple Tifereth Israel, a community in Los Angeles with a mainly Turkish ethnic background, still uses the de Sola Pool prayer books. === In India and the East Indies – Goa, Cochin, Chennai and Malacca === The signing of the Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494, divided the world between Portugal, and Spain. Portugal was allotted responsibility over lands east of the Tordesillas meridian. In 1498 Vasco Da Gama arrived on India's western coast where he was first greeted by a Polish Jew: Gaspar da Gama. In 1505 Portugal made Cochin its eastern headquarters, and in 1510 Goa was established as the capital of Portuguese India.  Goa  With the establishment of the Portuguese colonies in Asia, New Christians began flocking to India's western coast. Regarding Goa, the Jewish Virtual Library states that \\"From the early decades of the 16th century many New Christians from Portugal came to Goa. The influx soon aroused the opposition of the Portuguese and ecclesiastical authorities, who complained bitterly about the New Christians' influence in economic affairs, their monopolistic practices, and their secret adherence to Judaism.\\" Professor Walter Fischel of University of California, Berkeley observes that despite of the start of the inquisition in Portugal, the Portuguese relied heavily Jews and New Christians in establishing their fledgling Asian empire. The influence of Jews and New Christians in Goa was substantial. In his book, The Marrano Factory, Professor Antonio Saraiva of the University of Lisbon writes that \\"King Manuel theoretically abolished discrimination between Old and New Christians by the law of March 1, 1507 which permitted the departure of New Christians to any part of the Christian world, declaring that they 'be considered, favored and treated like the Old Christians and not distinct and separated from them in any matter.' Nevertheless, in apparent contradiction to that law, in a letter dated Almeirim, February 18, 1519, King Manuel promoted legislation henceforth prohibiting the naming of New Christians to the position of judge, town councilor or municipal registrar in Goa, stipulating, however, that those already appointed were not to be dismissed. This shows that even during the first nine years of Portuguese rule, Goa had a considerable influx of recently baptized Spanish and Portuguese Jews\\" There are even examples of well- positioned Portuguese Jews, and New Christians, leaving the Portuguese administration to work with the Muslim sultanates of India in an attempt to strike back at Portugal for what it had done to them viz-a-viz the inquisition in Portugal. Moises Orfali of Bar-Ilan University writes that the initially Portuguese colonial and ecclesiastical authorities complained in very strong terms about Jewish influence in Goa. The Goa Inquisition which was established in 1560 was initiated by Jesuit Priest Francis Xavier from his headquarters in Malacca due to his inability to reanimate the faith of the New Christians there, Goa and in the region who had returned to Judaism. Goa became the headquarters of the Inquisition in Asia.  Cochin, and Chennai  Cochin was, and still is, home to an ancient Jewish community (the Cochin Jews). Sephardic Jews from Iberia joined this community and became known as Paradesi Jews or \\"White Jews\\" (as opposed to older community which came to be known as the \\"Malabari Jews\\" or \\"Black Jews\\"). Cochin also attracted New Christians. In his lecture at the Library of Congress, Professor Sanjay Subrahmanyam of University of California, Los Angeles explains that New Christians came to India for economic opportunities (the Spice trade, the Golconda Diamonds trade, etc) and because India had well-established Jewish communities which allowed them the opportunity to rejoin the Jewish world. As explained by Professor Fischel, the Sephardic Jews of London were active in trading out of Fort St. George, India which later developed into the city of Madras, and is known today as Chennai and during the early years, the city council was required to have three Jewish aldermen to represent the community's interests.  Malacca  Malacca, Malaysia was in the 16th century a Jewish hub – not only for Portuguese Jews but also for Jews from the middle east and the Malabar. With its synagogues and rabbis, Jewish culture in Malacca was alive and well. Visible Jewish presence (Dutch Jews) existed in Malacca right up to the 18th century. Due to the inquisition a lot of the Jews of Malacca were either captured or assimilated into the Malacca-Portuguese (Eurasian) community where they continued to live as New Christians. Malacca was the headquarters of Jesuit priest Francis Xavier and it was his discovery of the conversos from Portugal there who had openly returned to Judaism as in the fortresses of India that became the turning point and from whence he wrote to King John III of Portugal to start the inquisition in the East. Prominent Malaccan Jewish figures include Portuguese Rabbi Manoel Pinto, who was persecuted by the Goa Inquisition in 1573 and Duarte Fernandes a former Jewish tailor who had fled Portugal to escape the Inquisition who became the first European to establish diplomatic relations with Thailand. ==Synagogues== Interior of the Portuguese Synagogue of Amsterdam, with the tebáh (bimah) in the foreground and the Hekhál (Torah ark) in the background. Most Spanish and Portuguese synagogues are, like those of the Italian and Romaniote Jews, characterised by a bipolar layout, with the tebáh bimah) near the opposite wall to the Hechál (Torah ark). The Hekhál has its parochet (curtain) inside its doors, rather than outside. The sefarim (Torah scrolls) are usually wrapped in a very wide mantle, quite different from the cylindrical mantles used by most Ashkenazi Jews. Tikim, wooden or metal cylinders around the sefarim, are typically not used. These were reportedly used, however, by the Portuguese Jewish community in Hamburg. The most important synagogues, or esnogas, as they are usually called amongst Spanish and Portuguese Jews, are the Portuguese Synagogue of Amsterdam and those in London and New York. Amsterdam is still the historical centre of the Amsterdam minhag, as used in the Netherlands and former Dutch possessions such as Surinam. Also important is the Bevis Marks Synagogue in London, the historical centre of the London minhag. The Curaçao synagogue (built in 1732 and known as the Snoa, the Papiamento form of esnoga) of the Mikvé Israel-Emanuel congregation is considered one of the most important synagogues in the Jewish history of the Americas. Since the late 20th century, many esnogas or synagogues in the Iberian Peninsula have been discovered by archaeologists and restored by both private and governmental efforts. In particular, the synagogues of Girona, Spain and Tomar, Portugal have been impressively restored to their former grandeur, if not their former social importance. (See the article Synagogue of Tomar.) Both Spain and Portugal have recently made efforts to reach out to descendants of Jews who were expelled from the peninsula in the 15th century, inviting them to apply for citizenship. ==Language== \\"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\\" typically spoke both Spanish and Portuguese in their Early Modern forms. This is in contrast to the languages spoken by Eastern Sephardim and North African Sephardim, which were archaic Old Spanish derived dialects of Judaeo- Spanish (\\"Ladino\\") and Haketia (a mixture of Old Spanish, Hebrew, and Aramaic, plus various other languages depending on the area of their settlement). Their Early Modern languages also differ from modern Spanish and Portuguese, as spoken by Sephardic Bnei Anusim of Iberia and Ibero-America, including some recent returnees to Judaism in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The use of Spanish and Portuguese languages by Western Sephardim persists in parts of the synagogue service. Otherwise, the use of Spanish and Portuguese quickly diminished amongst the Spanish and Portuguese Jews after the 17th century, when they were adapting to new societies. In practice, from the mid-19th century on, the Spanish and Portuguese Jews gradually replaced their traditional languages with the local ones of their places of residence for their everyday use. Local languages used by \\"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\\" include Dutch in the Netherlands and Belgium, Low German in the Altona, Hamburg area, and English in Great Britain, Ireland, Jamaica, and the United States. In Curaçao, Spanish and Portuguese Jews contributed to the formation of Papiamento, a creole of Portuguese and various African languages. It is still used as an everyday language on the island. Spanish and Portuguese Jews who have migrated to Latin America since the late 20th century have generally adopted modern standard Latin American varieties of Spanish as their mother tongue. ===Portuguese=== Because of the relatively high proportion of immigrants through Portugal, the majority of Spanish and Portuguese Jews of the 16th and 17th centuries spoke Portuguese as their first language. Portuguese was used for everyday communication in the first few generations, and was the usual language for official documents such as synagogue by-laws; for this reason, synagogue officers still often have Portuguese titles such as Parnas dos Cautivos and Thesoureiro do Heshaim. As a basic academic language, Portuguese was used for such works as the halakhic manual Thesouro dos Dinim by Menasseh Ben Israel and controversial works by Uriel da Costa. Portuguese is used – sometimes purely, other times in a mixture with Spanish and Hebrew – in connection with announcements of mitsvot in the esnoga, in connection with the Mi shebberakh prayer etc.Many of these phrases are given in I. Oeb Brandon (1892): see J Meijer, Encyclopaedia Sefardica Neerlandica p 211. In London, for example, mitsvot are announced using Portuguese designations for the different roles played: for example, for lifting up or unwrapping the first or second Sefer Torah, \\"que levantara/desenfaxara o primeiro/secundo sefer Torah\\"), whereas in New York these roles are instead announced in Hebrew. On Kol Nidre in London, the announcement of the order of who is to carry the Sefarim forms part of a Portuguese declaration beginning \\"a ordem dos Sefarim de esta noite\\". These Portuguese phrases are generally pronounced phonetically according to the spelling as interpreted by a Spanish speaker, rather than as a Portuguese speaker would, though a recording of the correct Portuguese pronunciation was made for the use of the Amsterdam community. The Judaeo- Portuguese dialect was preserved in some documents, but has not been used in everyday speech and is considered extinct since the late 18th century: for example, Portuguese ceased to be a spoken language in Holland in the Napoleonic period, when Jewish schools were allowed to teach only in Dutch and Hebrew. Sermons in Bevis Marks Synagogue were preached in Portuguese till 1830, when English was substituted. Judaeo-Portuguese has had some influence on the Judeo-Italian language of Livorno, known as Bagitto. ===Castilian (Spanish)=== Castilian Spanish was used as the everyday language by those who came directly from Spain in the first few generations. Those who came from Portugal regarded it as their literary language, as did the Portuguese at that time. Relatively soon, the Castilian Ladino took on a semi-sacred status (\\"Ladino\\", in this context, simply means literal translation from Hebrew: it should not be confused with the Judaeo-Spanish used by Balkan, Greek and Turkish Sephardim.) Works of theology as well as reza books (siddurim) were written in Castilian rather than in Portuguese; while, even in works written in Portuguese such as the Thesouro dos Dinim, quotations from the Bible or the prayer book were usually given in Spanish. Members of the Amsterdam community continued to use Spanish as a literary language. They established clubs and libraries for the study of modern Spanish literature, such as the Academia de los Sitibundos (founded 1676) and the Academia de los Floridos (1685). In England the use of Spanish and Portuguese continued until the early 19th century: In 1740 Haham Isaac Nieto produced a new translation into contemporary Spanish of the prayers for the New Year and Yom Kippur, and in 1771 a translation of the daily, Sabbath and Festival prayers. There was an unofficial translation into English in 1771 by A. Alexander and others by David Levi in 1789 and following years, but the Prayer Books were first officially translated into English in 1836, by hakham David de Aaron de Sola. Today Spanish and Portuguese Jews in England have little tradition of using Spanish, except for the hymn Bendigamos, the translation of the Biblical passages in the prayer-book for Tisha B'Av, and in certain traditional greetings. ===Hebrew=== The Hebrew of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews from the 19th century and 20th century is characterised primarily by the pronunciation of (Beth rafé) as a hard b (e.g., Abrahám, Tebáh, Habdaláh) and the pronunciation of (ʿAyin) as a voiced velar nasal (Shemang, Ngalénu). The hard pronunciation of Beth Rafé differs from the v pronunciation of Moroccan Jews and the Judaeo-Spanish Jews of the Balkans, but is shared by Algerian and Syrian Jews. The nasal pronunciation of 'Ayin is shared with traditional Italian pronunciation (where it can be either \\"ng\\" or \\"ny\\"), but not with any other Sephardi groups.For the development of this pronunciation, see Aron di Leone Leoni, The Pronunciation of Hebrew in the Western Sephardic Settlements (16th-20th Centuries). Second Part: The Pronunciation of the Consonant 'Ayin. Both these features are declining, under the influence of hazzanim from other communities and of Israeli Hebrew. The sibilants , , and are all transcribed as s in earlier sources. This, along with the traditional spellings Sabá (Shabbat), Menasseh (Menashe), Ros(as)anáh (Rosh Hashana), Sedacáh (tzedaka), massoth (matzot), is evidence of a traditional pronunciation which did not distinguish between the various sibilants—a trait which is shared with some coastal dialects of Moroccan Hebrew.This is corroborated by the frequent use, in Judaeo-Spanish, of without diacritic to mean Spanish s (to distinguish it from ç, rendered by ). On the other hand, s is often pronounced in Portuguese. Since the 19th century, the pronunciations (for and [ts] for have become common—probably by influence from Oriental Sephardic immigrants, from Ashkenazi Hebrew and, in our times, Israeli Hebrew. The (taw rafé) is pronounced like t in all traditions of Spanish and Portuguese Jews today, although the consistent transliteration as th in 17th-century sources may suggest an earlier differentiation of and . (Final is occasionally heard as d.) In Dutch-speaking areas, but not elsewhere, (gimel) is often pronounced like Dutch \\"g\\". More careful speakers use this sound for gimel rafé (gimel without dagesh), while pronouncing gimel with dagesh as .The pronunciation of \\"g\\" as in Dutch was originally a peculiarity of Amsterdam: the historic pronunciation was . The use of for gimel rafé is found in other communities, e.g. among Syrian and Yemenite Jews. Coincidentally, \\"g\\" following a vowel is pronounced as the approximant consonant in modern Spanish (but not in Portuguese). Dutch Sephardim take care to pronounce he with mappiq as a full \\"h\\", usually repeating the vowel: vi-yamlich malchutéhe. The accentuation of Hebrew adheres strictly to the rules of Biblical Hebrew, including the secondary stress on syllables with a long vowel before a shva. Also, the shvá nang in the beginning of a word is normally pronounced as a short eh (Shemang, berít, berakháh). Shva nang is also normally pronounced after a long vowel with secondary stress (ngomedím, barekhú). However it is not pronounced after a prefixed u- (and): ubne, not u-bene. Vocal shva, segol (short e) and tzere (long e) are all pronounced like the 'e' in \\"bed\\": there is no distinction except in length.In the Tiberian vocalization segol is open and tzere is closed , like French é; while in Ashkenazi Hebrew tzere is often as in \\"they\\". In both Ashkenazi and modern Hebrew, vocal shva is the indistinct vowel in French \\"le\\" and English \\"the\\" and sometimes disappears altogether. In some communities, e.g. Amsterdam, vocal shva is pronounced when marked with gangya (a straight line next to the vowel symbol, equivalent to meteg), and as when followed by the letter yodh: thus va-nashubah and bi-yom (but be-Yisrael).This rule forms part of the Tiberian vocalization reflected in works from the Masoretic period, and is laid down in grammatical works as late as Solomon Almoli's Halichot Sheva (Constantinople 1519), though he records that it is dying out and that \\"in most places\\" vocal shva is pronounced like segol. The differentiation between kamatz gadol and kamatz katan is made according to purely phonetic rules without regard to etymology, which occasionally leads to spelling pronunciations at variance with the rules laid down in the grammar books. For example, (all), when unhyphenated, is pronounced \\"kal\\" rather than \\"kol\\" (in \\"kal ngatsmotai\\" and \\"Kal Nidre\\"), and (noon) is pronounced \\"tsahorayim\\" rather than \\"tsohorayim\\". This feature is shared by other Sephardic groups, but is not found in Israeli Hebrew. It is also found in the transliteration of proper names in the King James Version such as Naomi, Aholah and Aholibah. ==Liturgy== Although all Sephardic liturgies are similar, each group has its own distinct liturgy. Many of these differences are a product of the syncretization of the Spanish liturgy and the liturgies of the local communities where Spanish exiles settled. Other differences are the result of earlier regional variations in liturgy from pre-expulsion Spain. Moses Gaster (died 1939, Hakham of the S&P; Jews of Great Britain) has shown that the order of prayers used by Spanish and Portuguese Jews has its origin in the Castilian liturgy of Pre-Expulsion Spain. As compared with other Sephardic groups, the minhag of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews is characterised by a relatively low number of cabbalistic additions. The Friday night service thus traditionally starts with Psalm 29, \\"Mizmor leDavid: Habu LaA.”. In the printed siddurim of the mid-17th century, “Lekhah Dodi\\" and the Mishnaic passage Bammeh madlikin are also not yet included, but these are included in all newer siddurim of the tradition except for the early West London and Mickve Israel (Savannah) Reform prayerbooks, both of which have Spanish and Portuguese roots. Of other, less conspicuous, elements, a number of archaic forms can be mentioned—including some similarities with the Italian and Western Ashkenazi traditions. Such elements include the shorter form of the Birkat hammazon which can be found in the older Amsterdam and Hamburg/Scandinavian traditions. The Livorno (Leghorn) tradition, however, includes many of the cabbalistic additions found in most other Sephardi traditions. The current London minhag is generally close to the Amsterdam minhag, but follows the Livorno tradition in some details—most notably in the Birkat hammazon. One interesting feature of the tradition (at least in New York and Philadelphia) is that, when reading the haftarah on Simhat Torah and Shabbat Bereshit, the Hatan Torah and Hatan Bereshit chant two extra verses pertaining to bridegrooms from Isaiah 61:10 and 62:5 at the end of the standard haftarot for the days themselves. This seems to be a unique remnant of the old tradition of reading Isaiah 61:10–63:9 if a bridegroom who had been married the previous week was present in synagogue. ==Music== Ashkibenu (Hashkiveinu) and Yigdal from the Spanish and Portuguese Jews' Congregation in London, harmonised by Emanuel Aguilar. ===Historical=== The ritual music of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews differs from other Sephardic music in that it is influenced by Western European Baroque and Classical music to a relatively high degree. Not only in Spanish and Portuguese communities, but in many others in southern FranceFor example the Provençal community of Comtat- Venaissin: see Louis Saladin, Canticum Hebraicum. and northern Italy,See for example Adler Israel, Hosha'ana Rabbah in Casale Monferrato 1732: Dove in the Clefts of the Rock, Jewish Music Research Center, Hebrew University of Jerusalem: Jerusalem 1990 (Yuval Music series Volume: 2) it was common to commission elaborate choral compositions, often including instrumental music, for the dedication of a synagogue, for family events such as weddings and circumcisions and for festivals such as Hoshana Rabbah, on which the halachic restriction on instrumental music did not apply. Already in 1603, the sources tell us that harpsichords were used in the Spanish and Portuguese synagogues in Hamburg. Particularly in the Amsterdam community, but to some degree also in Hamburg and elsewhere, there was a flourishing of Classical music in the synagogues in the 18th century. There was formerly a custom in Amsterdam, inspired by a hint in the Zohar, of holding an instrumental concert on Friday afternoon prior to the coming in of the Shabbat, as a means of getting the congregants in the right mood for the Friday night service. An important Jewish composer was Abraham Caceres; music was also commissioned from non- Jewish composers such as Cristiano Giuseppe Lidarti, some of which is still used. The same process took place in Italy, where the Venetian community commissioned music from non-Jewish composers such as Carlo Grossi and Benedetto Marcello. Another important centre for Spanish and Portuguese Jewish music was Livorno, where a rich cantorial tradition developed, incorporating both traditional Sephardic music from around the Mediterranean and composed art music: this was in turn disseminated to other centres.Seroussi (in Bibliography). In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, in particular in Italy at the time of the Italian unification, hazzanim sometimes doubled as opera singers, and some liturgical compositions from this period reflect this operatic character. Choirs Already in the 17th century, choirs were used in the service on holidays in the Amsterdam community: this choir still exists and is known as Santo Serviço. This custom was introduced in London in the early 19th century. In most cases, the choirs have consisted only of men and boys, but in Curaçao, the policy was changed to allow women in the choir (in a separate section) in 1863. Instrumental music There are early precedents for the use of instrumental music in the synagogue originating in 17th century Italy as well as the Spanish and Portuguese communities of Hamburg and Amsterdam and in the Ashkenazic community of Prague. As in most other communities the use of instrumental music is not permitted on Shabbat or festivals. As a general rule, Spanish and Portuguese communities do not use pipe organs or other musical instruments during services. In some Spanish and Portuguese communities, notably in France (Bordeaux, Bayonne), US (Savannah, Georgia, Charleston, South Carolina, Richmond, Virginia) and the Caribbean (Curaçao), pipe organs came into use during the course of the 19th century, in parallel with developments in Reform Judaism. In Curaçao, where the traditional congregation had an organ set up in the late 19th century, the use of the organ on Shabbat was eventually also accepted, as long as the organ player was not Jewish. In the more traditional congregations, such as London and New York, a free-standing organ or electric piano is used at weddings or benot mitzvah (although never on Shabbat or Yom Tob), in the same way as in some English Ashkenazi synagogues. ===Current practice=== The cantorial style of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews adheres to the general Sephardi principle that every word is sung out loud and that most of the ritual is performed communally rather than solistically (although nowadays in the New York community, the Pesukei dezimra (zemirot) throughout the year, Hallél on festivals or the new moon, and several of the selichot during Yom Kippur are chanted in a manner more similar to the Ashkenazi practice of reading only the first and last few verses of each paragraph aloud). The hazzan's rôle is typically one of guiding the congregation rather than being a soloist. Thus, there is traditionally a much stronger emphasis on correct diction and knowledge of the musical minhág than on the solistic voice quality.Traditionally, an auditioning cantor in an Ashkenazi synagogue is asked to sing Kol Nidre, a solo piece demanding great vocal dexterity, range and emotional expression, while in a Sephardi synagogue he is asked to sing Bammeh madlikin, a plainsong recitative which demands accuracy more than anything else. In the parts of the service where the ḥazzán would traditionally have a more solistic rôle, the basic melodies are embellished according to the general principles of Baroque performance practice: for example, after a prayer or hymn sung by the congregation, the ḥazzán often repeats the last line in a highly elaborated form. Two- and three-part harmony is relatively common, and Edwin Seroussi has shown that the harmonies are a reflection of more complex, four-part harmonies in written sources from the 18th century. The recitative style of the central parts of the service, such as the Amidah, the Psalms and the cantillation of the Torah is loosely related to that of other Sephardi and Mizraḥi communities, though there is no formal maqam system as used by most of these.An example of this recitative style can be heard in the first part of the 2002 BBC TV serial Daniel Deronda, where (now emeritus) Reverend Halfon Benarroch can be heard chanting the psalms that begin the Afternoon Service. The closest resemblance is to the rituals of Gibraltar and Northern Morocco, as Spanish and Portuguese communities traditionally recruited their ḥazzanim from these countries. There is a remoter affinity with the Babylonian and North African traditions: these are more conservative than the Syrian and Judaeo-Spanish (Balkan, Greek, Turkish) traditions, which have been more heavily influenced by popular Mediterranean, Turkish and Arabic music. In other parts of the service, and in particular on special occasions such as the festivals, Shabbat Bereshit and the anniversary of the founding of the synagogue, the traditional tunes are often replaced by metrical and harmonized compositions in the Western European style. This is not the case on Rosh Hashanah and Kippúr (Yom Kippur), when the whole service has a far more archaic character. A characteristic feature of Oriental Sephardic music is the transposition of popular hymn tunes (themselves sometimes derived from secular songs) to important prayers such as Nishmat and Kaddish. This occurs only to a limited extent in the Spanish and Portuguese ritual: such instances as exist can be traced to the book of hymns Imre no'am (1628), published in Amsterdam by Joseph Gallego, a hazzan originating in Salonica.Link to .pdf file; another link; on screen version. The book does not of course set out the tunes, but it names the songs that they were borrowed from. Certain well-known tunes, such as El nora aliláh and Ahhot ketannáh, are shared with Sephardi communities worldwide with small variations. ===Cantillation=== Spanish and Portuguese traditional cantillation has several unique elements. Torah cantillation is divided into two musical styles. The first is the standard used for all regular readings. A similar but much more elaborate manner of cantillation is used on special occasions. This is normally referred to as High Tangamim or High Na'um. It is used for special portions of the Torah reading, principally the Ten CommandmentsIn printed Hebrew Bibles, the Ten Commandments have two sets of cantillation marks: the ta'am 'elyon or \\"upper accentuation\\" for public reading and the ta'am taḥton or \\"lower accentuation\\" for private study. The term \\"High Tangamim\\" for the melody in question is borrowed from the ta'am 'elyon, for which it is used. but also Chapter 1 of Bereshit (on Simchat Torah), the Shirat ha-Yam, the Song of Moses, the concluding sentences of each of the five books and several other smaller portions.These passages are listed in Rodrigues Pereira, חָכְמַת שְׁלֹמֹה ('Hochmat Shelomoh) Wisdom of Solomon: Torah cantillations according to the Spanish and Portuguese custom. Many other Sephardic traditions use special melodies for these portions as well. However, the Spanish and Portuguese melody is different from most others. Anecdotally, the Spanish and Portuguese High Tangamim are similar to the melody of Kurdish Jews. Spanish and Portuguese Torah cantillation has been notated several times since the 17th century. The melodies now in use, particularly in London, show some changes from the earlier notated versions and a degree of convergence with the Iraqi melody.That is, the older melody used in Mosul and in most of the Iraqi Jewish diaspora, as distinct from the Baghdadi melody, which belongs to the Ottoman family: see Cantillation melodies and Sephardic cantillation. The rendition of the Haftarah (prophetic portion) also has two (or three) styles. The standard, used for most haftarot, is nearly identical with that of the Moroccan nusach. A distinctly more somber melody is used for the three haftarot preceding the ninth of Ab (the \\"three weeks\\".) On the morning of the Ninth of Ab a third melody is used for the Haftarah—although this melody is borrowed from the melody for the Book of Ruth. There is a special melody used for the Book of Esther: in London it is a cantillation system in the normal sense, while in New York and Amsterdam it is chant-like and does not depend on the Masoretic symbols. The books of Ruth, read on Shavuot, and Lamentations, read on the Ninth of Ab, have their own cantillation melodies as well. There is no tradition of reading Ecclesiastes. Most Spanish and Portuguese communities have no tradition of liturgical reading of the Shir haShirim (Song of Songs), unlike Ashkenazim who read it on Pesach and Oriental Sephardim who read it on Friday nights. However in the two weeks preceding Pesach a passage consisting of selected verses from that book is read each day at the end of the morning service. The chant is similar but not identical to the chant for Shir haShirim in the Moroccan tradition, but does not exactly follow the printed cantillation marks. A similar chant is used for the prose parts of the book of Job on the Ninth of Ab. There is no cantillation mode for the books of Psalms, Proverbs and the poetic parts of Job. The chant for the Psalms in the Friday night service has some resemblance to the cantillation mode of the Oriental traditions, but is not dependent on the cantillation marks. ==Communities, past and present== { border=\\"1\\" !width=\\"150pt\\"City !width=\\"150pt\\"Synagogue or CommunityDates shown refer to the founding of the community rather than the synagogue building, unless shown otherwise.

They specialize in jungle warfare tactics and counter-insurgency operations. Since 1974, more than 1,250 soldiers have graduated from the international training programme, which has a duration of eight weeks. Of this number, 85% were Guatemalan soldiers. The corps' soldiers are distinguished from regular troops by maroon berets with patches bearing a blazing sword. Its motto, inspired by Henri de la Rochejaquelein, is: \\"If I advance, follow me. If I stop, urge me on. If I retreat, kill me.\\" ==History== On 5 December 1974, Guatemala's military government created its Commando School (Escuela de Comandos). Three months later it renamed it the Kaibil Special Operations Training Centre (Centro de Adiestramiento y Operaciones Especiales Kaibil). The name \\"Kaibil\\" is derived from Kayb'il B'alam (Kaibil Balam), a Mam indigenous leader who evaded capture by the Spanish conquistadors under Pedro de Alvarado. Initially, the Kaibil Centre was located on two estates, El Infierno (\\"Hell\\") and La Pólvora (\\"Gunpowder\\") in the municipality of Melchor de Mencos, Petén department. On 12 January 1989, it was moved to the former headquarters of Military Zone 23, in Poptún, Petén. ==Training== US Marines assigned to the 2nd Tank Assault Amphibian Battalion supporting the Security Cooperation Task Force of Amphibiou According to the Ministry of Defence, the Kaibil Centre's mission is to train and develop elite commando forces: \\"To select, by means of arduous, difficult training under physical and mental pressure, members of the army capable of engaging in commando operations.\\" Recruitment is voluntary. However, several physical and psychological tests are required before entering. The training is given twice a year and lasts 60 days. Only 64 participants are allowed per training period, not older than 28 years of age. No more than 10 have graduated on a single period. Members of foreign military forces are sometimes selected to participate in training. Kaibil special forces on a training mission in Poptún. The commandos are trained in guerrilla warfare, counter-guerrilla operations, military behaviour, map reading, psychological preparation, military intelligence and counter-intelligence. Their training includes a special hand-to-hand combat system known as Temv-K'a (which means \\"Hands of Storm\\"), communications, survival techniques, obstacle courses, military hiking, special weapons, demolitions and emergency medical training. This includes aerial operations, day and night navigation, camp setup and security, evasion, escape, interventions and ambushes. Training is extremely physically and mentally demanding, and takes place during both daytime and nighttime. Sleep is permitted for no longer than three hours a day, but only if the right is earned. The right to eat must also be earned; before being allowed to eat, soldiers must successfully climb a rope, do five pull-ups, ten push-ups and run two miles in 18 minutes or less wearing full combat gear, then duck walk to the mess hall, after which they are given 30 seconds to eat. The first stage of training, which lasts 21 days, consists of theory instructions and practical military training, where the military and morale levels of a candidate are tested. It is followed by hard military training in the jungle, which includes instruction in jungle warfare as well as demolition and detection and deactivation of landmines, scuba diving, waterborne operations, construction of improvised training, SERE training, basic air mobile techniques, small-unit patrols, react to contact, and ambush training. In addition, cadets are exposed to prisoner of war camp situations and survival courses. During the last stage, they are trained to eat \\"anything that moves\\", including snakes and ants, as well as roots, to collect dew drops from leaves, as well as how to execute annihilation attacks, intelligence maneuvers, and penetration into enemy territory. During this stage, candidates must patrol through thorn-filled brush wearing nothing but underwear, roll around in thorns to fortify the body to pain, and spend two days in neck-deep water without sleeping in extreme tropical heat. This stage is called \\"El Infierno\\" (\\"Hell\\"). During training, every soldier has a cuaz (which in Q'eqchi' means: \\"Brother\\") assigned for the rest of their training. They become partners: they sleep, eat, and work together all the time. If one makes a mistake, they are both punished for it. The Kaibiles are infamous for their reputed practice of forcing recruits to kill animals, which includes raising a puppy and bonding with it before killing and eating it, as well as biting the heads off live chickens. In addition, recruits are shot and forced to perform field surgery on themselves, and to drink water out of recently fired artillery shells. As part of the course's finishing ritual, every recruit must drink \\"Bomb\\", a mix of tequila, whisky, rum, beer, water and gunpowder, served in a bamboo glass with a bayonet tied to it. Soldiers must drink it carefully, so as not to get drunk and cut themselves with the bayonet. Once they successfully complete this ritual, they are inducted into the Kaibiles.http://www.ghrc- usa.org/Publications/factsheet_kaibiles.pdfKatherine Ellison, Celebrity of Guatemalan Rights Activist Could Save His Life, Miami Herald, 22 November 1990http://justf.org/blog/2013/01/18/facts-about-guatemalas- kaibileshttp://kaibil.us/WHO%20ARE%20KAIBIL/Kaibiles%20training%20in%20Guatemalan%20hell.htm Even though in the past they were meant to be an anti-guerrilla unit, today they are oriented towards anti-terrorism, anti-kidnapping and anti-narcotics efforts, in line with current needs. ==Human rights issues== In February 1999, the Commission for Historical Clarification (Comisión para el Esclaracimiento Histórico, CEH), the truth and reconciliation body established under United Nations auspices by the 1996 Peace Accords that brought an end to the country's 35-year-long Civil War, called attention to the brutalising nature of the training conducted by the Kaibil Centre in its final report, Guatemala: Memoria del silencio (\\"Guatemala: Memory of Silence\\"): > The substantiation of the degrading contents of the training of the Army's > special counter insurgency force, known as Kaibiles, has drawn the > particular attention of the CEH. This training included killing animals and > then eating them raw and drinking their blood in order to demonstrate > courage. The extreme cruelty of these training methods, according to > testimony available to the CEH, was then put into practice in a range of > operations carried out by these troops, confirming one point of their > decalogue: \\"The Kaibil is a killing machine.\\" (CEH, §42) The Commission's report documented examples of massacres of civilians by the Kaibiles, most notably the December 1982 Dos Erres massacre. In December 1996, shortly before the signing of the Peace Accords, President Álvaro Arzú spoke of his intention to preserve the Kaibiles in peacetime but to rededicate them to another war: the war on narcotics and crime. Addressing a Kaibil graduation ceremony in Poptún, he said: \\"Now this new army of peace will face an enemy that perhaps is much more powerful than the one we faced for many years. We are talking of drug traffickers and criminals who want to corrode the country; they are better armed, equipped, and trained than the enemies we had to face in the past.\\" However, under the terms of the Peace Accords, the army was to have been restricted to defence from external attack, which would preclude involvement in the sort of domestic police actions proposed by President Arzú. The Kaibiles' record and reputation led the Roman Catholic Church's Interdiocese Project for the Recovery of Historical Memory (Proyecto Interdiocesano de Recuperación de la Memoria Histórica, REMHI) to recommend that the group be disbanded in its April 1998 report, \\"Guatemala: Never Again\\" (Guatemala: Nunca Más). According to Jane's Intelligence Review \\"The army has refused to disband the Special Forces Training and Operations Centre, housed at El Infierno, in the vicinity of Poptún, Petén.\\" In December 1998, Jane's reported that there were three groups of Kaibiles, one consisting of instructors, and two consisting of 162 commandos apiece. Each group was divided into four 38-men platoons, further subdivided into squads of 9 soldiers. ==Recent history== Currently there are Kaibiles stationed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as part of the United Nations MONUSCO peacekeeping force. On 23 January 2006, a unit of 80 Kaibiles failed in an attempt to capture Vincent Otti, the deputy commander of Uganda's Lord's Resistance Army, in Congo's Garamba National Park. Eight Kaibiles and at least fifteen guerrillas were killed in the resulting gunfight. More recently, it has been alleged, that some former members of the Kaibiles have formed relationships with the Los Zetas mercenary group. Los Zetas are a group of elite Mexican paratroopers and intelligence operatives who deserted their Special Air Mobile Force Group in 1999 and have since been hired as \\"enforcers\\" by the drugs traffickers of the Gulf Cartel. However, Los Zetas now operates as an independent organization since its rupture from the Gulf Cartel in early 2010. ==See also== *Ephod Combat Vest *OR-201 ==References== The first version of this article was modified and edited from Guatemala: Kaibiles and the Massacre at Las Dos Erres, a public domain (dead link) information request response document of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. == External links == * Category:1974 establishments in Guatemala Category:Human rights abuses in Guatemala Category:Military units and formations established in 1974 Category:Special forces of Guatemala ","title":"Kaibiles"},{"id":"2233967","text":"Portrait of Alvise Cornaro by Tintoretto Alvise Cornaro, often Italianised Luigi (1467 or 1464 gives a birth date of 1467 – 8 May 1566), was a Venetian nobleman and patron of arts, also remembered for his four books of Discorsi (published 1583-95) about the secrets to living long and well with measure and sobriety. ==Early life== Born in Padua, the son of an innkeeper, who claimed a connection to the noble Cornaro family of Venice, a connection he was at pains to prove, Cornaro expanded a modest stake from his mother's brother into a fortune based on his entrepreneurial skills, especially in hydraulics that reclaimed wetlands for farming, expressed in his Tratto di Acque (\\"Tract on Water management\\") of 1566. ==Later life== As a patron, Cornaro sat to Tintoretto for his portrait and guided the career of the Veronese artist- architect Giovanni Maria Falconetto, whose Loggia and Odeo Cornaro (1524) for Alvise's then suburban garden in Padua was an early Renaissance-style building in the Veneto. As financial advisor to the Bishop of Padua, he secured for Falconetto the commission to design the Villa dei Vescovi (\\"Villa of the Bishops\\") at Luvigliano, in the Eugaean Hills, as well as his own Villa Cornaro in Este. Later in life, from about 1538, Cornaro was acquainted with the young mason who was to become Andrea Palladio.Palladio's Literary Predecessors Cornaro's own views on architecture are expressed in his Trattato dell'architettura (\\"Treatise on Architecture\\"). Cornaro constructed two theatres, the Odeo Cornaro in Padua and another in the gardens of his villa at Este. ==Publications== When he was about 40, Cornaro found himself exhausted and in poor health, a condition he attributed to a hedonistic lifestyle with excessive eating, drinking, and sexual licentiousness. On the advice of doctors, he began to adhere to a calorie restriction diet specially for morbid obese/anorexia nervosa persons, centered on the \\"quantifying principle\\" of restricting himself to only 350g of food daily (including bread, egg yolk, meat, and soup) and 414 mL of wine. His book Discorsi della vita sobria (Discourses On the Temperate Life), which described his regimen, was extremely successful, and \\"was a true reconceptualization of old age. As late as the Renaissance it was largely the negative aspects of this phase of life which were emphasized ... Cornaro’s method offered the possibility for the first time not only of a long but also a worthwhile life.\\" After his conversion to a holistic lifestyle, he remained in vigorous health well into old age. In 1550, when Cornaro was about 83, he was urged to write down his secrets of health, and its English translation, often referred to today under the title The Sure and Certain Method of Attaining a Long and Healthful Life, went through numerous editions; he wrote three follow-ups in 1553, 1558, and 1562. The first three were published at Padua in 1558. They are written, says Joseph Addison, in the early 18th century periodical The Spectator (No. 195), \\"with such a spirit of cheerfulness, religion and good sense, as are the natural concomitants of temperance and sobriety.\\" Friedrich Nietzsche criticized the work for mistaking the consequence with the cause, insisting that Cornaro's diet is not the cause of his long life, but rather that the cause of his long life - which Nietzsche gives as his slow metabolism - is the reason for his diet. Cornaro maintained that longevity was desirable and \\"God wills it\\". He rejected ascetics who believed man must suffer in this life to attain salvation in the next, arguing that there was no reason one could not enjoy both his earthly existence and his heavenly one. In addition, he rejected conventional wisdom that old age was a period of misery and decay, writing \\"And now some sensual and unreasonable individuals pretend that the existence of a man after he passes the age of 65 cannot be termed a living one, but a dead one. I will plainly demonstrate that they are mistaken, for I have a desire that all men should attain my age, which is the most beautiful period of life.\\" He also commented that at the age of 83, his health was good, he could perform most functions unassisted, and he had a wide circle of younger friends and correspondents. Cornaro also firmly condemned those with a live- fast-and-die-young mentality, stating that \\"They don't stop and consider the virtue of ten more years of active life, at a point where we've reached a high point of experience and wisdom, two things that can only be honed with time.\\" He died at Padua at age 98, according to his birth and death date in the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica; other sources give his age at death as 102. In the work known as Illustrissimi, a collection of letters written by Pope John Paul I when he was Patriarch of Venice, Cornaro serves as one of the \\"recipients\\" of the letters. There are 40 letters in all, mainly to people in Italian history and fiction, but also to internationally well known fictional and historical characters such as Pinocchio, Charles Dickens, Hippocrates, and Jesus. ==References* * Luigi Cornaro Online writings on the Temperate life * C.I.

Walter Thompson advertising agency and a pioneer of many advertising techniques. ==Biography== He was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts on October 28, 1847. In 1864, William James Carlton started selling advertising space in religious magazines. The agency was called Carlton and Smith, although almost nothing is known about the Smith partner. In 1868, Carlton hired Thompson as a bookkeeper. Eventually Thompson found that soliciting and sales were much more profitable and he became a very effective salesman for the small company. In 1877, Thompson bought the agency for $500 and renamed it J. Walter Thompson Company. Thompson paid $800 for the Carlton and Smith furniture in the same transaction. Realizing that he could sell more space if the company provided the service of developing content for advertisers, Thompson hired writers and artists to form the first known creative department in an advertising agency. He is credited as the \\"father of modern magazine advertising\\" in the United States. Thompson, having served on the USS Saratoga in the Civil War, was a passionate sailor. He owned a variety of vessels, including a seagoing houseboat, a steam, (Stella). He headed the New York Yacht Club, for which his title as Commodore and his portrait became famous within the company. He lived at 11 East Sixty-eighth Street in Manhattan. He developed the Roosevelt Manor section of Cranford in the 1890s and built the Cranford Opera House block in Cranford, New Jersey for his wife, Margaret Riggs Boyle Thompson, in 1892.Toniann Antonelli, Township Marks 100th Anniversary of 'Cranford's Great Fire': A century ago, an entire row of businesses known as The Opera House Block was destroyed in a massive fire downtown. Cranford Patch, February 3, 2012Guide to the J. Walter Thompson Company. Iconographic Collection, 1848-2005 and undated Duke University Libraries The J. Walter Thompson Company was incorporated in 1896. In 1899, Thompson opened an office in London. An avid traveler, Thompson went abroad nearly every summer for twenty years, and rarely came back without important accounts. He saw New York as \\"the flagship\\" office for a company with no geographical restrictions. \\"It has no limitations. Any spot on earth where goods are to be sold by advertising is inside the fence of the Thompson field\\", said Thompson. In 1900, JWT published a house ad explaining trademark advertising. This was the first known commercial explanation of what we now know as brand management. Thompson soon became known for his philosophy of drawing a straight line between the manufacturer and the consumer. In 1916, Stanley B. Resor and several partners bought the company from the aging Thompson for $500,000. In 1930, a letter addressed to Thompson arrived from soon-to-be president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, asking for a job for his son, Elliott, guaranteeing that \\"he has a perfectly good mind\\"; JWT’s mother was a distant cousin of FDR, but Thompson had died in 1928. Elliott never did work for JWT. ==Legacy== Thompson is responsible for some enduring brand images in popular culture, such as the Rock of Gibraltar used for the Prudential Insurance Company. Today, JWT is one of the largest advertising agencies in the United States and the fourth-largest in the world. It is one of the key companies of Sir Martin Sorrell's WPP Group (NASDAQ:WPPGY) and is headquartered in New York. The global agency is led by Worldwide Chairman and Global CEO Bob Jeffrey who took over the role in 1998. JWT was named Adweek magazine's 2009 \\"Global Agency of the Year.\\" ==In popular culture== Thompson plays a minor role in Jack Finney's Time and Again. ==References== Category:1847 births Category:1928 deaths Category:Businesspeople in advertising Category:United States Marines ","title":"James Walter Thompson"},{"id":"2233979","text":"Libertarian Movement may refer to one of the following subjects: * Libertarian Movement (Costa Rica) * Libertarian Movement (Italy) * Libertarian movement in the United States, see Libertarianism in the United States * Libertarian migration movement to New Hampshire, see Free State Project ","title":"Libertarian Movement"},{"id":"2233990","text":"Cleveden Secondary School is a school located in Kelvinside in the West End of Glasgow. ==The school== In 1973, the Glasgow High School for Girls, situated in the same building as the present school, began accepting both male and female pupils, and in 1975 was officially re-opened as Cleveden Secondary School.Kelvindale history and schooling The school exists in its current form as the result of a merge between Cleveden and North Kelvinside Secondary Schools between 1998 and 2001.

The new extensions provide twenty-six teaching spaces including general classrooms, music, drama, sports and technical facilities, as well as administration offices. A striking new social space was added offering a dining and performing space for pupils. In addition to the general refurbishment of the existing school building, the works also included provision of a rationalised suite of eight ICT classrooms and thirteen departmental bases. Every teaching space, office and administration area now has ICT provision. The renovated building now has thirty-one classrooms, eight dedicated ICT teaching areas, ten science labs, five technical rooms, five art and design rooms, three home economics rooms, three music rooms, gymnasium, games hall, fitness suite and swimming pool. The library was also revamped and a new IT Learning Centre was created to help pupils and teachers make the most of internet technology. The works also provided a new synthetic sports pitch within the school grounds and a further two grass pitches and one blaes pitch located at the nearby Kirklee site. ==References== Category:Secondary schools in Glasgow Category:Educational institutions established in 1975 ","title":"Cleveden Secondary School"},{"id":"2233996","text":"Apocalypse Now Redux is a 2001 extended version of Francis Ford Coppola's epic war film Apocalypse Now, which was originally released in 1979. Coppola, along with editor/longtime collaborator Walter Murch, added 49 minutes of material that had been removed from the original film. It represents a significant re- edit of the original version. ==Production== Francis Ford Coppola began production on the new cut with working-partner Kim Aubry. Coppola then tried to get Murch, who was reluctant at first. He thought it would be extremely difficult recutting a film that had taken two years to edit originally. He later changed his mind (after working on the reconstruction of Orson Welles' Touch of Evil). Coppola and Murch then examined several of the rough prints and dailies for the film. It was decided early on that the editing of the film would be like editing a new film altogether. One such example was the new French plantation sequence. The scenes were greatly edited to fit into the movie originally, only to be cut out in the end. When working again on the film, instead of using the heavily edited version, Murch decided to work the scene all over again, editing it as if for the first time. Much work needed to be done to the new scenes. Due to the off-screen noises during the shoot, most of the dialogue was impossible to hear. During post-production of the film the actors were brought back to re-record their lines (known as A.D.R. or dubbing). This was done for the scenes that made it into the original cut, but not for the deleted scenes. For the Redux version, Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, Sam Bottoms, Albert Hall, Frederic Forrest, and Aurore Clément were brought back to record ADR for the new scenes. ===Music=== New music was composed and recorded for the remade film by San Francisco Bay Area-based composer Ed Goldfarb.Ken Hughes, \\"Ed Goldfarb: Synthesizing the Apocalypse\\" (2001), Keyboard, Vol. 27, No. 9, pp. 54-56, 58. Available at https://openmusiclibrary.org/article/959386. Article reprinted at https://edgoldfarbmusic.com/portfolio/apocalypse-now-redux. For example, it was thought no music had been composed for Willard and Roxanne's romantic interlude in the French Plantation scene. To make matters worse, composer Carmine Coppola had died in 1991. However, the old recording and musical scores were checked and a track titled \\"Love Theme\\" was found. During scoring, Francis Coppola had told Carmine, his father, to write a theme for the scene before it was ultimately deleted. For the remake, the track was recorded by a group of synthesists.Ken Hughes, \\"Ed Goldfarb: Synthesizing the Apocalypse\\" (2001), Keyboard, Vol. 27, No. 9, pp. 54-56, 58. Available at https://openmusiclibrary.org/article/959386. Article reprinted at https://edgoldfarbmusic.com/portfolio/apocalypse-now-redux. ===Cinematography=== Vittorio Storaro also returned from Italy to head the development of a new color balance of the film and new scenes. When Redux was being released, Storaro learned that a Technicolor dye-transfer process was being brought back. The dye-transfer is a three-strip process that makes the color highly saturated and has consistent black tone. Storaro wished to use this on Redux, but in order to do it, he needed to cut the original negative of Apocalypse Now, leaving Apocalypse Now Redux the only version available. Storaro decided to do it, when convinced by Coppola that this version would be the one that would be remembered. ==New scenes and alterations== The film contains several alterations, and two entirely new scenes. One of the new scenes has the boat meeting the Playmates once again, further up the river; the other has them meet a family of holdout French colonists on their remote rubber plantation. There are also a few additional scenes with Colonel Kurtz. ==Cast== * Christian Marquand as Hubert de Marais * Aurore Clément as Roxanne Sarrault * Roman Coppola as Francis de Marais * Gian-Carlo Coppola as Gilles de Marais * Michel Pitton as Philippe de Marais * Franck Villard as Gaston de Marais * David Olivier as Christian de Marais * Chrystel Le Pelletier as Claudine * Robert Julian as The Tutor * Yvon Le Saux as Sgt. Le Fevre * Henri Sadardiel as French soldier #1 * Gilbert Renkens as French soldier #2 ==Reception== Apocalypse Now Redux originally premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. The screening marked the anniversary of the original Apocalypse Now screening as a work in progress, where it won the Palme d'Or. Coppola went to the festival, accompanied by Murch, Storaro, production designer Dean Tavoularis, producer Kim Aubry and actors Bottoms and Clément. ===Box office=== The film was given a limited release in the U.S. on August 3, 2001, and was also released theatrically around the world in some countries, grossing in the United States and Canada, and in other territories, for a worldwide total of . ===Critical response=== On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 93% approval rating based on 82 reviews, with an average rating of 7.78/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"The additional footage slows down the movie somewhat (some say the new cut is inferior to the original), but Apocalypse Now Redux is still a great piece of cinema.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 92 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Some critics thought highly of the additions, such as A. O. Scott of The New York Times, who wrote that it \\"grows richer and stranger with each viewing, and the restoration of scenes left in the cutting room two decades ago has only added to its sublimity.\\" Some critics, however, thought the new scenes slowed the pacing, were too lengthy (notably the French plantation sequence), and added nothing overall to the film's impact. Owen Gleiberman wrote \\"Apocalypse Now Redux is the meandering, indulgent art project that [Francis Ford Coppola] was still enough of a craftsman, in 1979, to avoid.\\" Despite this, other critics still gave it high ratings. Roger Ebert wrote: \\"Longer or shorter, redux or not, Apocalypse Now is one of the central events of my life as a filmgoer.\\" ==Soundtrack== A soundtrack was released on July 31, 2001 by Nonesuch. The soundtrack contains most of the original tracks (remastered), as well as some for the new scenes (\\"Clean's Funeral\\", \\"Love Theme\\"). The score was composed by Carmine and Francis Ford Coppola (with some tracks co-composed by Mickey Hart and Richard Hansen). The first track is an abridged version of The Doors' \\"The End\\".

He had a brief playing career which included spells at Distillery, Port Vale, Macclesfield Town, Ards, and Cliftonville. He spent some years as a coach in the United States and England, before he was appointed as manager of Sligo Rovers in September 2004. He led the club to the League of Ireland First Division title in 2005. He took charge at Bohemians in November 2006, before losing his job in December 2007. He was appointed Dundalk manager in December 2008, and then joined Galway United as manager in December 2010. He then had brief and highly unsuccessful spells coaching in Africa with Zimbabwean side CAPS United in 2012 and South African club Black Leopards in 2014. He returned to management in Northern Ireland with Institute in September 2019. ==Playing career== Connor began his career at Distillery in the Irish League, playing for the club in the 1987–88 season before he joined English Third Division club Port Vale. He never made an appearance for the \\"Valiants\\" in the English Football League and went out on loan to Macclesfield Town of the Conference before he returned to Northern Ireland to play for Ards. He was involved in a car accident soon after signing for Ards, breaking his chest bone, some ribs, puncturing his lung and damaging his left leg. He made a return to football with Cliftonville but retired shortly afterwards. ==Managerial careerEarly career=== After spending some time as press officer for Birmingham City, Connor moved to America where he coached in the USL First Division under John McGinlay for Cincinnati Riverhawks, Boston Bulldogs and in the Eastern Indoor Soccer League with the Lafayette SwampCats. He also spent time coaching non-league clubs in England and scouting for Stoke City and Lincoln City. ===League of Ireland=== Connor was appointed Sligo Rovers manager in September 2004 upon the recommendation of Steve Bruce. He led the club to the League of Ireland First Division title in 2005 as Rovers finished two points clear of second-place Dublin City. He then took the club to a fifth place in the League of Ireland Premier Division in 2006 and the semi-finals of the FAI Cup, where they lost to Derry City after a replay. During his time at The Showgrounds he signed Séamus Coleman. Connor tendered his resignation in November 2006 after stating that he felt he was \\"never fully accepted\\" at the club and life there was like \\"living in a goldfish bowl\\". He was appointed as manager of Bohemians in November 2006. He led the \\"Bohs\\" to third-place in 2007, earning them a place in the UEFA Intertoto Cup. He also took the club to the semi-finals of the FAI Cup, where they were beaten by Cork City at Dalymount Park. However he was sacked by the club after he allegedly made \\"advances of a sexual nature\\" to a female volunteer; Connor denied the claim. In December 2008, he was appointed as the manager of newly promoted Premier Division side Dundalk, who were transitioning from amateur status to become professional. He was voted Premier Division Manager of the Month for July 2009, and led the club to a fifth-place finish in the 2009 season, earning them a place in the following season's UEFA Europa League qualification rounds. He resigned in November 2009. In January 2010, he signed a three-year contract to manage Galway United. He led the \\"Tribesmen\\" to an eighth-place finish in the 2010 season, and a relegation play-off win over Bray Wanderers at Terryland Park secured the club a place in the top-flight for the following year. His contract was \\"terminated by mutual agreement\\" in September 2011 after the club suffered their 23rd consecutive league defeat. ===Africa=== In January 2012, Connor was appointed as manager of Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League side CAPS United. His contract was terminated in August 2012 following a poor run of results. He fled Zimbabwe after claiming that he had received death threats from the club's staff and fans, that the club still owed him $90,000, and that the players deliberately underperformed to get him the sack. He spent some time in exile in South Africa without any finances as the legal battle with CAPS United continued. He signed a three-year contract to manage South African National First Division side Black Leopards in July 2014, and was instructed to guide the club into the Premier Soccer League. He was fired after just six weeks having picked up just two points from his first three games. He joined the coaching staff at the Maiden City Soccer Academy in County Londonderry in March 2015. ===Institute=== On 14 September 2019, he returned to senior management when he was appointed as first-team manager at NIFL Premiership club Institute. The \\"Sky Blues\\" were relegated after finishing bottom of the Premiership when the 2019–20 season was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Ireland; Connor said the decision to relegate the club without the full fixture list completed was \\"a very, very sad day for football\\". ==Honours== ;Individual *League of Ireland Premier Division Manager of the Month: July 2009 ;Sligo Rovers *League of Ireland First Division: 2005 ==References== Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Belfast Category:Association footballers from Northern Ireland Category:People educated at St. Mary's Christian Brothers' Grammar School, Belfast Category:Lisburn Distillery F.C. players Category:Expatriate association footballers from Northern Ireland Category:Port Vale F.C. players Category:Macclesfield Town F.C. players Category:Ards F.C. players Category:Cliftonville F.C. players Category:League of Ireland players Category:National League (English football) players Category:UEFA Pro Licence holders Category:Football managers from Northern Ireland Category:Expatriate football managers from Northern Ireland Category:Sligo Rovers F.C. managers Category:Bohemian F.C. managers Category:Dundalk F.C. managers Category:Galway United F.C. managers Category:Expatriate football managers in Zimbabwe Category:CAPS United F.C. managers Category:Expatriate soccer managers in South Africa Category:Black Leopards F.C. managers Category:Institute F.C. managers Category:Eastern Indoor Soccer League coaches Category:League of Ireland managers Category:Association football coaches Category:Association football scouts Category:Birmingham City F.C. non-playing staff Category:Stoke City F.C. non-playing staff Category:Lincoln City F.C. non-playing staff Category:Wigan Athletic F.C. non-playing staff Category:Association footballers not categorized by position ","title":"Sean Connor"},{"id":"2234001","text":"High Stile is a mountain in the western part of the Lake District in North West England. It is the eleventh-highest English Marilyn, standing 807 metres (2,648 ft) high, and has a relative height of 362 metres (1,187 ft). It is the highest in the range of fells extending north-west from Great Gable towards Loweswater, and together with its satellites, Red Pike and High Crag, forms a trio of fells overlooking the lake and village of Buttermere. On this side are high crags, wild combes and a small tarn, Bleaberry Tarn. High Stile is most easily ascended as part of a traverse of the three fells. ==Topography== The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Volume 7 The Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1966): The highest section of the northern branch is formed by the trio of Buttermere fells, High Crag, High Stile and Red Pike. The Buttermere Fells, also known as Buttermere Edge,Bill Birkett:Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): form the watershed between Buttermere and Upper Ennerdale. The Ennerdale flanks are steep and rough with areas of crag, the lower slopes being planted with a ribbon of conifers. Across the narrow ridge-top to the north are deep corries and dark walls of crag, glowering down over the lake. The ridge continues south east to Haystacks and the Great Gable group. Beyond Red Pike to the west are Starling Dodd, Great Borne and the Loweswater Fells. Comb Beck, with High Stile above All three Buttermere Fells throw out a short spur towards the lake with deep combs hollowed out between them. North west of High Stile is Bleaberry Comb, backed by the wall of Chapel Crags. Nestled deep within is Bleaberry Tarn, a pool which is on continual shadow from November to March. Despite the steep contours of the rock walls above, the tarn is only about deep, and is well stocked with trout.Blair, Don: Exploring Lakeland Tarns: Lakeland Manor Press (2003): Bleaberry Tarn is drained into Buttermere by Sourmilk Gill, reaching the lake mere yards from its outlet. A belt of trees has been planted along the shoreline. Birkness Comb, also called Burtness Comb on Ordnance Survey maps, lies between the truncated and unnamed northern ridges of High Crag and High Stile. The lack of a retaining moraine means that this hollow has no tarn, Comb Beck running uninterrupted to the Lake. Grey Crag and Eagle Crag are the main faces on High Stile. These corries being scooped out of the northern face result in the connecting ridges between the three Buttermere Fells being fine and narrow. The Ennerdale flanks have a tier of crag at around , The Knors and Raven Crag being the principal features. At the foot of the slopes are the massed conifers of the Ennerdale Forest, all contributing to the difficulty of access. There are no paths on the southern flank of High Stile. ==Geology== The summit area is formed of the siltstone, sandstone, conglomerate, tuff, lapilli-tuff and andesite sills of the Eagle Crag Member. The northern slopes display the underlying olistostrome of disrupted, sheared and folded mudstone, siltstone and sandstone of the Buttermere Formation. In the direction of Red Pike are intrusions of the granophyric granite.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) In Burtness Comb, a prominent bank of debris runs along the outer flank of the upper cirque, then turns down into the lower cirque, ending in a block strew at the intake wall. It marks the course of a rock avalanche which fell from Grey Crag on the summit rim of High Stile, and was channeled along the foot of the glacier some 11,000 years ago.Wilson, P. and Jarman, D. 2013. The Burtness Comb rock avalanche. Proceedings Geological Association 124, 477-483 It is unique in the Lake District. There are the remains of a small copper-mine near the shore of Buttermere. This was worked from 1569 to 1570 and again in the 1820s.Adams, John: Mines of the Lake District Fells: Dalesman (1995) ==Summit== The highest point lies a little way out onto the northern spur at the top of Grey Crag, marked by a cairn. The highest point on the main ridge is only lower and was regarded as the summit by Alfred Wainwright, the maps available at the time not deciding the issue. This top has two main cairns side by side. In an attempt to avoid confusion some guidebooks refer to the summit as Grey Crag and the top on the ridge as High Stile. The view is extensive, the highlight perhaps being the North Western Fells across the Buttermere valley. Ennerdale Water and Crummock Water are in view and careful steps toward the brink can also add Bleaberry Tarn to the picture. Fine views of the crags of the surrounding combs complete the foreground. ==Ascents== The fell is usually ascended as a traverse of the ‘Buttermere Three’, as the north eastern flank is very steep and rough. Strong walkers may continue the walk towards Haystacks, four miles (6 km) to the south east. The direct ascent from Ennerdale (through forest and steep bracken) is not found in guidebooks. The fell is climbed as part of Variation 1 on the Coast to Coast Walk. Direct ascents can be made if desired via either of the northern combs. From the shore of Buttermere a path runs up into Birkness Comb from where the northern spur can be gained. From Buttermere village the path to Bleaberry Tarn can be used, branching off to find a line around the eastern end of Chapel Crags. If climbing from Ennerdale the route up Red Pike may be used. ==References== Category:Fells of the Lake District Category:Marilyns of England Category:Hewitts of England Category:Nuttalls Category:Allerdale Category:Borough of Copeland ","title":"High Stile"},{"id":"2234009","text":"A simple configuration in von Neumann's cellular automaton. A binary signal is passed repeatedly around the blue wire loop, using excited and quiescent ordinary transmission states. A confluent cell duplicates the signal onto a length of red wire consisting of special transmission states. The signal passes down this wire and constructs a new cell at the end. This particular signal (1011) codes for an east-directed special transmission state, thus extending the red wire by one cell each time. During construction, the new cell passes through several sensitised states, directed by the binary sequence. Von Neumann cellular automata are the original expression of cellular automata, the development of which was prompted by suggestions made to John von Neumann by his close friend and fellow mathematician Stanislaw Ulam. Their original purpose was to provide insight into the logical requirements for machine self-replication, and they were used in von Neumann's universal constructor. Nobili's cellular automaton is a variation of von Neumann's cellular automaton, augmented with the ability for confluent cells to cross signals and store information. The former requires an extra three states, hence Nobili's cellular automaton has 32 states, rather than 29. Hutton's cellular automaton is yet another variation, which allows a loop of data, analogous to Langton's loops, to replicate. == Definition  Configuration === In general, cellular automata (CA) constitute an arrangement of finite state automata (FSA) that sit in positional relationships between one another, each FSA exchanging information with those other FSAs to which it is positionally adjacent. In von Neumann's cellular automaton, the finite state machines (or cells) are arranged in a two-dimensional Cartesian grid, and interface with the surrounding four cells. As von Neumann's cellular automaton was the first example to use this arrangement, it is known as the von Neumann neighbourhood. The set of FSAs define a cell space of infinite size. All FSAs are identical in terms of state-transition function, or rule- set. The neighborhood (a grouping function) is part of the state-transition function, and defines for any cell the set of other cells upon which the state of that cell depends. All cells make their transitions synchronously, in step with a universal \\"clock\\" as in a synchronous digital circuit. === States === Each FSA of the von Neumann cell space can accept any of the 29 states of the rule-set. The rule-set is grouped into five orthogonal subsets. Each state includes the colour of the cell in the cellular automata program Golly in (red, green, blue). They are # a ground state U # the transition or sensitised states (in 8 substates) ## S (newly sensitised) ## S0 – (sensitised, having received no input for one cycle) ## S00 – (sensitised, having received no input for two cycles) ## S000 – (sensitised, having received no input for three cycles) ## S01 – (sensitised, having received no input for one cycle and then an input for one cycle) ## S1 – (sensitised, having received an input for one cycle) ## S10 – (sensitised, having received an input for one cycle and then no input for one cycle) ## S11 – (sensitised, having received input for two cycles) # the confluent states (in 4 states of excitation) ## C00 – quiescent (and will also be quiescent next cycle) ## C01 – next-excited (now quiescent, but will be excited next cycle) ## C10 – excited (but will be quiescent next cycle) ## C11 – excited next-excited (currently excited and will be excited next cycle) # the ordinary transmission states (in 4 directions, excited or quiescent, making 8 states) ## North-directed (excited and quiescent) ## South-directed (excited and quiescent) ## West-directed (excited and quiescent) ## East-directed (excited and quiescent) # the special transmission states (in 4 directions, excited or quiescent, making 8 states) ## North-directed (excited and quiescent) ## South-directed (excited and quiescent) ## West-directed (excited and quiescent) ## East-directed (excited and quiescent) \\"Excited\\" states carry data, at the rate of one bit per state transition step. Note that confluent states have the property of a one-cycle delay, thus effectively holding two bits of data at any given time. === Transmission state rules === The flow of bits between cells is indicated by the direction property. The following rules apply: * Transmission states apply the OR operator to inputs, meaning a cell in a transmission state (ordinary or special) will be excited at time t+1 if any of the inputs pointing to it is excited at time t * Data passes from cell A in an ordinary transmission state to an adjacent cell B in an ordinary transmission state, according to the direction property of A (unless B is also directed towards A, in which case the data disappears). * Data passes from cell A in a special transmission state to an adjacent cell B in a special transmission state, according to the same rules as for ordinary transmission states. * The two subsets of transmission states, ordinary and special, are mutually antagonistic: ** Given a cell A at time t in the excited ordinary transmission state ** pointing to a cell B in any special transmission state ** at time t+1 cell B will become the ground state. The special transmission cell has been \\"destroyed\\". ** a similar sequence will occur in the case of a cell in the special transmission state \\"pointing\\" to a cell in the ordinary transmission state === Confluent state rules === The following specific rules apply to confluent states: * Confluent states do not pass data between each other. * Confluent states take input from one or more ordinary transmission states, and deliver output to transmission states, ordinary and special, that are not directed toward the confluent state. * Data are not transmitted against the transmission state direction property. * Data held by a confluent state is lost if that state has no adjacent transmission state that is also not pointed at the confluent state. * Thus, confluent-state cells are used as \\"bridges\\" from transmission lines of ordinary- to special-transmission state cells. * The confluent state applies the AND operator to inputs, only \\"saving\\" an excited input if all potential inputs are excited simultaneously. * Confluent cells delay signals by one generation more than OTS cells; this is necessary due to parity constraints. === Construction rules === The nine cell types that can be constructed in von Neumann's CA. Here, binary signals pass along nine ordinary transmission lines, constructing a new cell when they encounter a ground state at the end. For example, the binary string 1011 is shown on the fifth line, and constructs the east-directed special transmission state – this is the same process as used in the automaton at the top of this page. Note that there is no interaction between neighbouring wires, unlike in Wireworld for example, allowing for a compact packing of components. Initially, much of the cell- space, the universe of the cellular automaton, is \\"blank,\\" consisting of cells in the ground state U. When given an input excitation from a neighboring ordinary- or special transmission state, the cell in the ground state becomes \\"sensitised,\\" transitioning through a series of states before finally \\"resting\\" at a quiescent transmission or confluent state. The choice of which destination state the cell will reach is determined by the sequence of input signals. Therefore, the transition/sensitised states can be thought of as the nodes of a bifurcation tree leading from the ground-state to each of the quiescent transmission and confluent states. In the following tree, the sequence of inputs is shown as a binary string after each step: * a cell in the ground state U, given an input, will transition to the S (newly sensitised) state in the next cycle (1) * a cell in the S state, given no input, will transition into the S0 state (10) ** a cell in the S0 state, given no input, will transition into the S00 state (100) *** a cell in the S00 state, given no input, will transition into the S000 state (1000) **** a cell in the S000 state, given no input, will transition into the east-directed ordinary transmission state (10000) **** a cell in the S000 state, given an input, will transition into the north-directed ordinary transmission state (10001) *** a cell in the S00 state, given an input, will transition into the west-directed ordinary transmission state (1001) ** a cell in the S0 state, given an input, will transition into the S01 state (101) *** a cell in the S01 state, given no input, will transition into the south-directed ordinary transmission state (1010) *** a cell in the S01 state, given an input, will transition into the east-directed special transmission state (1011) * a cell in the S state, given an input, will transition into the S1 state (11) ** a cell in the S1 state, given no input, will transition into the S10 state (110) *** a cell in the S10 state, given no input, will transition into the north- directed special transmission state (1100) *** a cell in the S10 state, given an input, will transition into the west-directed special transmission state (1101) ** a cell in the S1 state, given an input, will transition into the S11 state (111) *** a cell in the S11 state, given no input, will transition into the south-directed special transmission state (1110) *** a cell in the S11 state, given an input, will transition into the quiescent confluent state C00 (1111) Note that: * one more cycle of input (four after the initial sensitization) is required to build the east- or north-directed ordinary transmission state than any of the other states (which require three cycles of input after the initial sensitization), * the \\"default\\" quiescent state resulting in construction is the east-directed ordinary transmission state- which requires an initial sensitization input, and then four cycles of no input. === Destruction rules === Roughly 4000 bits of data in a curled up \\"tape\\" constructing a complex pattern. This uses a 32-state variation of von Neumann cellular automata known as Hutton32. * An input into a confluent-state cell from a special-transmission state cell will result in the confluent state cell being reduced back to the ground state. * Likewise, an input into an ordinary transmission-state cell from a special-transmission state cell will result in the ordinary-transmission state cell being reduced back to the ground state. * Conversely, an input into a special transmission-state cell from an ordinary-transmission state cell will result in the special- transmission state cell being reduced back to the ground state. ==See also== *Codd's cellular automaton *Langton's loops *von Neumann Universal Constructor *Wireworld ==References== * Von Neumann, J. and A.

He is a member of R&B; group B2K. The group achieved success in the early 2000s with singles like \\"Bump, Bump, Bump\\", \\"Uh Huh\\", and \\"Girlfriend\\", which all reached success on the Billboard Hot 100. == Early life == J-Boog, the youngest of three children, was born and raised in Compton, California and has been rapping, singing, and dancing since the age of two. He is the first cousin of Marques Houston. ==B2K== J-Boog was a member of the boy group B2K, along with Lil' Fizz, Raz-B, and Omarion. He starred in You Got Served, the hit dance movie, with his B2K bandmates, along with Marques Houston. He played the character Rico, the peacemaker of the group. Despite the film receiving mostly negative reviews, his performance in the movie was praised by many critics. Soon after, B2K announced they were disbanding and led each member on a various future endeavors. == Post-B2K == After the split of the boy band, Jarell partnered with bandmate Lil Fizz in 2006, where they recorded an EP album \\"Night Life\\".

It is the eleventh installment in the Crash Bandicoot series and the fifth game in the main franchise. The game's story takes place three years after the events of Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex and follows the main protagonist and main antagonist of the series, Crash Bandicoot and Doctor Neo Cortex, who must work together to stop the Evil Twins, a pair of interdimensional parrots, from destroying the Wumpa Islands. Crash Twinsanity began development as Crash Bandicoot Evolution and was intended to have a more serious tone than previous games. The similarity of the game's premise to Ratchet & Clank convinced Traveller's Tales to restart production and create Crash Twinsanity as a comedic title in which Doctor Cortex would be teamed up with Crash as a means of exploring his character. The game marks the debut of Lex Lang as the voice of Doctor Cortex, replacing previous actor Clancy Brown. Various concepts were removed from the game during production due to time constraints, but were incorporated into the final game as unlockable extras. Crash Twinsanity received mixed reviews upon release. Critics praised the gameplay variety, visuals, humour and Lang's voice-acting, but had mixed reactions to the music and criticized the camera, controls and platforming sections. Two mobile versions of the game were subsequently released and also met with mixed receptions. == Gameplay == Crash Twinsanity features several styles of gameplay, one of which is named \\"HumiliSkate\\", in which Crash rides Dr. Cortex as a snowboard. Crash Twinsanity differs from previous entries in the series through its free-roaming gameplay style; the player can explore the game's environments in all directions and travel seamlessly between levels. As opposed to the \\"hub room\\" format utilized by previous games, the player's progression through Twinsanity is influenced by the plot. Over the course of the game, the player controls three different characters: Crash Bandicoot, Doctor Neo Cortex (or both at the same time) and new character Nina Cortex; the controlled character alternates between particular levels. Crash is the primary player character and has the ability to jump into the air and land on enemy characters, spin in a tornado-like fashion to knock enemies off-screen, slide across the ground and perform a body slam to break certain objects. Cortex is armed with a raygun and a limited amount of ammo, and Nina uses her mechanical arms to punch enemies and latch onto distant ledges. When Crash and Cortex are together, Crash can use Cortex to increase the range of his spin attack, use Cortex's head as a hammer to break certain objects, and hurl Cortex across gaps to activate switches. Two levels in the game incorporate a gameplay style named \\"HumiliSkate\\", which involves Crash riding Cortex as a makeshift snowboard, while two others are played in a style named \\"Doc Amok\\", which involves Crash clearing a path for a fleeing Cortex. Another gameplay style, named \\"RollerBrawl\\", involves the player steering Crash and Cortex through the level as they engage in a brawl. Wumpa Fruit is scattered throughout the game, and grant an extra life if 100 Fruits are collected. Crates also carry Wumpa Fruit, which can be obtained if the crates are broken. TNT crates explode after a three-second fuse when jumped on, while Nitro crates explode upon any physical contact. Crates with plungers will detonate any Nitro crates in the immediate vicinity. Checkpoint crates allow the player to return to a specific point in the stage upon losing a life, while World crates save the player's progress. Gems littered throughout the levels can be collected to unlock extra content such as concept art and storyboards. ==Plot== Three years after his previous defeat by Crash Bandicoot in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, Dr. Neo Cortex returns to the Wumpa Islands to exact revenge on Crash. Cortex incapacitates Crash's sister, Coco and impersonates her to lure Crash into a trap. After Crash's victory against Cortex and his Mecha-Bandicoot, Cortex and Crash are both sent plummeting down a hole and land in a cave. Enraged by his defeat, Cortex attacks Crash, and the pair engage in a prolonged fight across the cave. Upon returning to the surface, Crash and Cortex encounter a pair of interdimensional parrots named the Evil Twins, who plan to destroy the Wumpa Islands and steal Cortex's brain. After Cortex pleads for Crash's help, he is spontaneously attacked by bees and finds himself captured by Papu Papu and his subordinate tribesmen after stumbling into their territory. Crash rescues Cortex from captivity and escapes a pursuing mob of tribesmen. Crash and Cortex have another encounter with the Evil Twins, who bring a deity statue to life to attack the pair. Cortex, having learned that the Evil Twins come from the Tenth Dimension, concocts a plan and beckons Crash to his arctic lair. Crash and Cortex attempt to enter the Iceberg Lair through the front entrance, but the door is frozen shut, forcing the pair to take an alternate path inside. They inadvertently free Uka Uka in the process, who attacks them with a giant body formed from ice. Uka Uka is convinced by his twin brother Aku Aku to join forces and attack the Evil Twins themselves, but both are easily defeated. Cortex introduces the Psychetron, a device that will allow travel to the Tenth Dimension, but requires Power Crystals to function. Crash uses Cortex as an impromptu snowboard in an attempt to reach Doctor N. Gin's battleship and gather the Power Crystals, and destroys Dingodile's shack in the process. Crash's venture through the battleship eventually results in an explosion of a cache of TNT crates, which sinks the ship and propels Crash into a confrontation with Doctors Nefarious Tropy and Nitrus Brio on a distant ice floe. Crash returns to the Iceberg Lair with Cortex, where the latter is attacked by a recovered Coco, who believes that Cortex kidnapped Crash. Coco's assault sends two of the Power Crystals flying into the Psychetron, which damages the machine and paralyzes Coco in a chain reaction. Crash and Cortex set a course for Madame Amberly's Academy of Evil in the hopes of recruiting Cortex's niece Nina to assist in repairing the Psychetron. Crash and Cortex sneak into the Academy through the sewer system, where they fend off an attack from Dingodile. After Cortex finds Nina and has an encounter with Madame Amberly, he recalls the origin of the Evil Twins; when Cortex was an 8-year- old student in the Academy, he used his two pet parrots Victor and Moritz as test subjects for a prototype of his Evolvo-Ray, but the experiment resulted in the parrots being transported to the Tenth Dimension, where they would be mutated by the environment's severe \\"reverso-radioactivity\\". The trio return to the Iceberg Lair, repair the Psychetron and travel to the Tenth Dimension to face the Evil Twins. Upon their arrival, Nina is kidnapped by an evil doppelganger of Crash and taken to his desolate home on Twinsanity Island. After cornering Evil Crash, Cortex valiantly offers himself in Nina's stead, which leads to a chase. Crash, Cortex and Nina escape Evil Crash and make their way to the Evil Twins' compound, where Cortex confronts the Evil Twins and commands them back into their cage. The Evil Twins transform their cage into a giant robot and engage in a final battle with the trio. The Evil Twins are defeated and flee the compound, only to be devoured by Evil Crash when they take refuge in his home. After the trio return to their own dimension, Cortex attempts to eliminate Crash, but the malfunctioning Psychetron teleports Cortex into Crash's brain, where he is trapped with a crowd of dancing Crash duplicates. == Development and release == Crash Twinsanity marks the debut of Lex Lang (pictured in 2013) as the voice of series antagonist Doctor Neo Cortex. Crash Twinsanity was developed by Traveller's Tales' Oxford division and published by VU Games under its Sierra Entertainment brand. The game was originally titled Crash Bandicoot Evolution and featured a premise involving the Evil Twins stealing Crash's island from Earth and grafting it onto a giant planet made from pieces of others. The tone of the game was intended to be more serious than preceding entries in the series, with the term \\"edgy\\" being widely used among the development team. In response to the release of Insomniac Games' Ratchet & Clank, which featured an identical premise, Traveller's Tales abandoned Crash Bandicoot Evolution and restarted production with a focus on making the next Crash title as comedic as possible. The new game went through several working subtitles, including Unlimited, Fully Fluxed and Twinsane. Eventually, VU Games gave Traveller's Tales one hour to choose the final title before the default selection of Unlimited. Concept artist Keith Webb came up with the title Crash Twinsanity with only five minutes to spare. The game was announced as Crash Bandicoot: Unlimited on March 26, 2004, with Crash Twinsanity originally intended as the game's American title. Lead designer Paul Gardner and artist Daniel Tonkin explained that Doctor Cortex was made playable as an opportunity to explore his character, and was teamed up with Crash because \\"it didn't make sense to make them two opposing characters who were playable because the player would be kind of playing against himself\\". Producer and creative director David Robinson cited Jay and Silent Bob and The Ren & Stimpy Show as the central influences on the game's character dynamic, as both properties provide a variation of two opposing personalities spending a large amount of time together; Ren & Stimpy crew member Jordan Reichek wrote the game's script, provided creative input on the characters and game mechanics, and illustrated the game's cover art. The character Nina Cortex was created and designed by Duke Mighten for an early version of Crash Nitro Kart, and was re-appropriated for Crash Twinsanity due to her popularity among the development team. Gardner created a rough model of Nina modified from that of Neo Cortex, and her final model was created by Chris Abedelmassieh. Nina's model was created over the course of a single weekend. Although Crash Twinsanity was intended to be Nina's debut appearance, Gardner was alerted to her early appearance in Crash Bandicoot Purple: Ripto's Rampage by Webb, who came across Nina's image in newly released screenshots of the game. Crunch Bandicoot was included in a cameo appearance due to his fan-favourite status. A stage taking place in Coco's mind, \\"Gone a Bit Coco\\", was removed because production was too far along to guarantee that the stage could be finished and played without crashing. Other content, such as a cameo by Fake Crash and the appearance of a good version of Doctor Cortex, was also removed, but appears in unlockable concept images in the final game.Crash Twinsanity (PlayStation 2, Xbox) Extras A punching maneuver by Crash that appeared in the Crash Bandicoot Unlimited demo was removed due to its inadvertent capability of destroying scenery. Crash Twinsanitys voice actors were cast and directed by Chris Borders. Lex Lang was called in for an audition to replace previous voice actor Clancy Brown, as VU Games reportedly considered Brown's performance to be \\"too mean\\". After Borders described Doctor Cortex to Lang and had him listen to signature samples of Brown's performance, he encouraged Lang to play Cortex as more flamboyant and self-absorbed. Lang eventually created a depiction of Cortex that was \\"master evil with a bit of a childish feminine side that leaks out in his tirades\\" that had everyone laughing at the lines and the character. Monty Python's Flying Circus was an additional influence on Lang's delivery as Cortex. Other cast members include Mel Winkler, Michael Ensign, Susan Silo, Debi Derryberry, Alex Fernandez, Dwight Schultz and Quinton Flynn. The full- motion videos of Crash Twinsanity were created by Red Eye Studios, who previously created the full-motion videos for Crash Nitro Kart. The soundtrack of Crash Twinsanity was composed, performed, arranged and produced by a cappella band Spiralmouth, while Gabriel Mann recorded and mixed the soundtrack at Asylum Recording Studios in Los Angeles. Crash Twinsanity was showcased alongside other VU Games titles at the Game Stars Live consumer games show held at ExCeL London from September 1–5, 2004. VU Games' booth featured a \\"Challenge Corner\\" where attendees competed for Crash and Spyro- based prizes. The game went gold on September 7, 2004, and was released in North America on September 28, 2004 and in Europe on October 8, 2004. A version for the GameCube was announced, but not released; IGN speculated that the port's cancellation was due to the disappointing financial performance of other VU Games titles on the system. In the United Kingdom, Crash Twinsanity debuted at #25 in the sales charts, and remained within the top 40 best- sellers by the 2004 Christmas season. A mobile version of Crash Twinsanity was developed by VU Games, published by I-play and released on November 6, 2004. The mobile version consists of six levels based on the \\"Doc Amok\\" stages of the console version. Another mobile version, titled Crash Twinsanity 3D, was published by Vivendi Games Mobile and Wonderphone and developed by Kuju Entertainment for an exclusive selection of 3G java-enabled handsets that accompanied the commercial launch of Vodafone live! in December 2004, including the Motorola E1000, V980 and C980, the Nokia 6630, the Sony Ericsson V800, the Sharp 802 SH and 902 SH, and the Toshiba V902T. In this version, the player controls Crash Bandicoot, who must sprint along a three-dimensional road and dodge obstacles, defeat enemies and collect items en route. In 2007, the PlayStation 2 version of Crash Twinsanity was re-released in the three- disc Crash Bandicoot Action Pack compilation alongside Crash Nitro Kart and Crash Tag Team Racing. == Reception == Crash Twinsanity received mixed reviews from critics upon release. The open-world setting was welcomed as an improvement over the \\"claustrophobic\\" level design of previous games, and the various gameplay styles were commended as clever and well-implemented; James B. Pringle of IGN compared the 'ingenious' Doc Amok levels to Lemmings, and Louis Bedigian of GameZone considered the RollerBrawl sequence to be the game's best. However, the platforming sections were considered formulaic and tired. The gameplay aspect of controlling Crash and Cortex in tandem drew comparisons to Jak and Daxter and Whiplash, while the RollerBrawl segment was widely compared to Super Monkey Ball. The character Nina Cortex was positively received by critics, some of whom compared her extending robotic arms to Bionic Commando. The game's camera was widely criticized as dodgy and uncooperative, and the controls were deemed sluggish. Kristan Reed of Eurogamer and GR Chimp of GameRevolution respectively derided the checkpoint/autosave system as faulty and spaced too far apart. Most assessments of the visuals were positive. Pringle noted the \\"cartoon-like\\" feel given to the game by its crisp and vibrant colors. Chris Stead of Australian GamePro acknowledged the graphics as \\"quite pretty\\", but stated that the collision detection and frequent invisible barriers \\"leave a lot to be desired\\". Brent Soboleski of TeamXbox, Ryan Davis of GameSpot and Nick Valentino of GameZone proclaimed Twinsanity to be the best-looking Crash Bandicoot game to date; they pointed out the increased detail in Crash and Cortex's designs and their smoother and more expressive animations that telegraph their personalities, although Soboleski, Davis and GR Chimp felt the particle and lighting effects and frame rate in the PlayStation 2 version were inferior to those in the Xbox version. Soboleski and Reed observed a lack of texture and detail in the environments, and Reed and Wooldridge pointed out the short draw distance. Bedigian and a blurb in Electronic Gaming Monthly both dismissed the visuals as lacklustre. Pringle and Reed commended the full- motion videos for their polished quality, though the inability to skip them was seen as a nuisance. The audio, particularly the music, was met with a mixed response. Pringle stated that the music was fitting, but admitted that he \\"wasn't a fan\\" of the \\"pop-jazz\\" music in the snow/ice level, which \\"ended up wearing on my nerves after a while\\". Soboleski praised the voice-acting as \\"well done, with the right amount of sarcasm, humor and attitude to keep players laughing\\", but criticized the music as \\"quite repetitive and pretty cliché based on what we have been hearing year after year from the series.\\" Andrew Wooldridge of 1Up.com was amused by the game's music and said that \\"Sounding something like a team of Bobby McFerrin wannabes (you know, \\"Don't Worry, Be Happy\\") the vocalists really go all out to give the game a slapstick feel\\". Davis commended the music as catchy and admired the unique a cappella aspect of the soundtrack, but added that while the game's stock Crash Bandicoot sound effects \\"fit snugly\\" into the sound design, \\"some of them are used too often and some of them just sound a little tired.\\" While Valentino enjoyed the game's soundtrack, Bedigian lambasted it as \\"insanely annoying music that doesn't fit with the wacky and crazy world of Crash Bandicoot\\". Vincent Lopez of Official Xbox Magazine remarked that the \\"mixed-up\\" score \\"would find a welcome home in Pee Wee's Playhouse\\". Reed found the music to be \\"occasionally inspired\\" and was surprised by the quality of some of the game's tracks (citing the Uka Uka boss fight as an example), but warned that \\"others, however, numb the brain into mulch so don't expect undiluted quality\\". Andrew Reiner of Game Informer acknowledged the game's \\"doo-wop and choral music- influenced\\" score and vocal arrangements as \\"wildly inventive\\". GR Chimp described the soundtrack as a \\"thoroughly weird and catchy\\" \\"combination of jungle, pop and a barbershop quartet\\", and opined that \\"the quirky approach to the composition helps give the game its attitude\\". The humourous dialogue and slapstick comedy were considered a highlight, and the characterization of Doctor Cortex and Lex Lang's vocal performance were singled out for praise. Pringle noted that the game \\"shows a side of the evil doctor that we haven't seen before\\" and, while describing the game's dialogue as \\"solid,\\" said that \\"Cortex is the one you want to keep listening to.\\" Soboleski believed that Cortex was \\"probably the best and most entertaining character of the game since players get a completely different look at his personality this time through,\\" and felt that he was \\"very funny and his sarcasm and evil attitude are a perfect match for his personality.\\" Davis analyzed \\"Cortex's constant creeping and sniveling\\" as \\"a great showcase of the kinds of neuroses that might cause one to gain an interest in evil science,\\" and added that \\"the strained grandeur of Cortex's speech\\" was the most accomplished voice work in the game. Valentino felt that \\"the biggest laughs, believe it or not, come from Doctor Neo Cortex who comes off as nutty in the best possible way. He's filled with witty observations and often pokes fun of his past encounters with Crash.\\" He later remarked that \\"the twisted Doctor is one hilarious bloke and his dialogue just makes him all the more likeable\\". Reiner admitted that \\"turning Cortex into a cross-dressing lunatic brought about a few chuckles\\". Reception to the mobile versions was also mixed. Levi Buchanan of IGN considered the I-play version to be \\"infinitely more enjoyable\\" than its console counterpart, pointing out the colorful graphics and \\"well-done\\" character art, but noting the insensitive controls and lack of audio as negative points. Avery Score of GameSpot commented positively on the \\"tried- and-true\\" gameplay, \\"great\\" graphics, \\"decent\\" value and \\"good\\" character likenesses, but criticized the lack of in-game audio, \\"finicky\\" control, lack of innovation in terms of gameplay, lack of enemy characters and the fact that Cortex seemed \\"mindless\\". Chris James of Pocket Gamer gave Crash Twinsanity 3D a score of 5 out of 10, noting the game's simple and relatively responsive controls and polished presentation, but criticising the awkward perspective, \\"very finicky\\" collision detection, lengthy character animation and long loading screens. == Continuation == Preceding the European release of Crash Twinsanity, Daniel Tonkin stated that Traveller's Tales was \\"still very interested in the franchise and I think if the opportunity came up we'd be more than happy to do another game\\". A pitch for a new Crash Bandicoot game, tentatively titled Cortex Chaos, was developed by Traveller's Tales after Twinsanitys completion. The game's premise centered around Crash being sucked into several television programs by an invention created by Cortex. Twinsanity was ultimately followed by the Radical Entertainment-developed titles Crash of the Titans and Crash: Mind over Mutant. In a 2012 interview, Keith Webb noted that if his video game Go! Go! Kokopolo was successful enough for him to expand his studio, he would try to approach Activision with a bid to create Cortex Chaos with as many members of the Twinsanity development team as possible. On August 3, 2017, following the release of the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Webb sent an open letter to Vicarious Visions congratulating them on the game's success. In the letter, Webb stated that if Activision ever expressed interest in developing a Twinsanity remake, he and a handful of previous developers would gladly return to work on it. == References  Notes = Citations === == External links == * Category:2004 video games Category:Crash Bandicoot games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:Xbox games Category:Cancelled GameCube games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:3D platform games Category:Traveller's Tales games Category:Universal Interactive games Category:Sierra Entertainment games Category:Video games set in Australia Category:Video games featuring parallel universes Category:Single-player video games Category:Crossover video games Category:Twins in fiction ","title":"Crash Twinsanity"},{"id":"2234031","text":"The Costa Rican Renewal Party () is a Christian political party in Costa Rica. ==History== Established in 1995, as a splinter of the National Christian Alliance, the party first participated in national elections in 1998, when its presidential candidate, Sherman Thomas Jackson, received 1.4% of the vote,Nohlen, D (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I, p182 whilst they won a single seat in the parliamentary elections, taken by pastor and lawyer Justo Orozco. During the 1999–2000 popular protests against the electric liberalization bill known as Combo ICE, Orozco supported the protests and voted against the bill. Orozco was the party's presidential candidate in 2002, finishing fifth with 1.1% of the vote. The party also retained its sole parliamentary seat in the elections, taken by Carlos Avendaño. However, Avendaño left the party and founded his own (National Restoration Party). In the 2006 elections the party's candidate Bolívar Serrano Hidalgo won 3.4% of the vote in the presidential election, but the party lost its parliamentary seat (to Avendaño's party). Journalist David Romero Mora, well known for his book El caso Chemise, endorsed the party in this period. During the 2007 Costa Rican Dominican Republic – Central America Free Trade Agreement referendum, it stood with the opposition to the agreement. In 2010 elections, former Tibás mayor Mayra Gonzalez finished sixth in the presidential contest with 0.7%, but the party regained parliamentary representation, winning a solitary seat, taken by Orozco. Orozco was very polemic during his tenure especially because some of his public comments were accused of homophobia and because he was elected president of the Human Rights Commission of Parliament thanks to his alliance with then ruling PLN. Orozco was candidate again in 2014 gaining similar results (1% of the votes) yet obtaining 2 seats in Congress, took by Gonzalo Ramírez Zamora and Abelino Esquivel. One of them, Gonzalo Ramírez Zamora, was elected president of the Legislative Assembly for the 2017–2018 period, supported by the National Liberation Party branch. During the mandatory party structures renovation process for the 2017–2018 election campaign, the party divided between Orozco supporters and critics. Orozco critics, lead by both party congressmen at that moment, Gonzalo Ramírez and Abelino Esquivel, won the process, so Orozco and his supporters left the party, and did not join any other for that election. At the end, Ramírez tendency, considered pro-PLN, took control of the party, also excluding Esquivel's tendency from the party conduction and candidate lists. With both Orozco and Esquivel center-leftist tendencies out of the race, journalist Stephanie Campos was elected as presidential candidate and former liberacionista right-wing Congressman Daniel Gallardo Monge as its head of list. Finally, the party got very weak results and couldn't maintain any seat in Congress. The party holds very conservative beliefs and is directed toward the evangelical Christian minority, opposing such subjects as abortion, same-sex marriage, marijuana legalization and violent video games. ==See also== * Evangelical Christian politics in Latin America ==References== Category:1995 establishments in Costa Rica Category:Conservative parties in Costa Rica Category:Political parties established in 1995 Category:Political parties in Costa Rica Category:Protestant political parties ","title":"Costa Rican Renewal Party"},{"id":"2234032","text":"Democratic Force () nicknamed “El Naranjazo” (the Big Orange or the Orange Hit because the color of its flag) was a political party in Costa Rica.

Until 2002 he was a member of Fianna Fáil, and since then has been independent. ==Early life and career== Michael Collins was born in Abbeyfeale, County Limerick in 1940. He is the son of James Collins and a brother of Gerry Collins, both Fianna Fáil members of Dáil Éireann. Collins was involved in local politics for many years, serving as a councillor and chairman of the Limerick County Council. He was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1997 general election as a Fianna Fáil TD and held his seat until retiring at the 2007 general election citing health reasons. His nephew, Niall Collins was elected to succeed him, maintaining the family's continuous occupation of a seat in that constituency since the 1948 general election. ==Tax evasion== Collins hit the headlines in 2003 when it was revealed that he had set up a bogus offshore account to evade paying tax. He settled the bill with the Revenue Commissioners, paying over €130,000 in taxes, interest and penalties. He also resigned from the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party after it emerged he was on a list of tax defaulters. On 11 July 2006, Collins appeared in Rathkeale district court charged with two tax offences: cheating the Collector General and obtaining a tax clearance certificate by false pretences. He was remanded on bail until 28 September 2006 when he was due to appear at Limerick District Court. On 9 January 2007 the Court decided to adjourn the case until after the General Election. On 28 September 2007 after just under an hour of deliberation, a jury of seven men and five women returned its verdict. Collins was found guilty of obtaining a tax clearance certificate under false pretences. ===Response of Standards Commission=== Collins provided a Tax Clearance Certificate and a Statutory Declaration to the Standards Commission on 14 June 2002 as evidence of his compliance with the Tax Acts. When Collins name appeared in Iris Oifigiúil the State gazette, as the holder of a bogus non-resident bank account, the Standards Commission sought legal advice and were advised that in the absence of a complaint, it did not have the legal authority to investigate Collins. The Commission advised the Minister for Finance of the limitations of the Ethics Acts which had been exposed through this matter. Subsequently, the Chairman of the Committee on Members' Interests of Dáil Éireann made a written complaint and the Committee determined that an investigation be carried out by the Commission on foot of this. The investigation commenced but has been suspended pending the outcome of the Garda investigation and legal proceedings. The Standards Commission is concerned at the length of time this matter has been under consideration and urges that it be resolved without delay. ==See also== *Families in the Oireachtas ==References== Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:Fianna Fáil TDs Category:Independent TDs Category:Members of the 28th Dáil Category:Members of the 29th Dáil Category:Local councillors in County Limerick Category:Irish people convicted of tax crimes ","title":"Michael Collins (Limerick politician)"},{"id":"2234037","text":"Patriotic Alliance () is a political party in Costa Rica.

With its highest summit, the Combin de Grafeneire, it is one of the highest peaks in the AlpsConsidering peaks with at least 300 metres prominence, it is the eighth highest. and the second most prominent of the Pennine Alps. The Grand Combin is also a large glaciated massif consisting of several summits, among which three are above 4000 metres (Combin de Grafeneire , Combin de Valsorey , Combin de la Tsessette ). The highest part of the massif is wholly in Switzerland, although the border with Italy lies a few kilometres south. The normal route starts from the Panossière Hut, which lies on the north side in the Corbassière valley. Despite the fact that no major difficulties exist, a particularly dangerous passage has to be traversed on the north flank: Le Corridor. It is a couloir dominated by seracs continuously falling on it.Helmut Dumler,Willi P. Burkhardt, Les 4000 des Alpes, ==Geography== Corbassière Valley: Grand Combin (left) and Combin de Corbassière (right) The massif of the Grand Combin lies in Lower Valais, south of Verbier between the Val d'Entremont (west) and Val de Bagnes (west). The north-western facing side of Grand Combin is entirely covered by eternal snows and glaciers which are prone to serac falls. The southern and eastern walls are more steep and thus exempt of snow. The topography of the Grand Combin is intricate. Between the Val d'Entremont and the Val de Bagnes are two high ridges, nearly parallel to each other and to those valleys, which both diverge from a short transverse ridge of great height. The southern end of the space enclosed between these three ridges is an elevated plateau of great extent, where the snows accumulate and feed the Corbassière Glacier which descends thence for about ten kilometers to the north. The glacier is surrounded by the peaks of Petit Combin, Combin de Corbassière and Combin de Boveire on the west, Grand Tavé and Tournelon Blanc on the east. Smaller glaciers lie on the external flanks such as Boveire and Mont Durand Glacier. At the south-east extremity of the plateau, the highest part of the enclosing ridge is surmounted by two conical summits, of which the higher south-west point (Grand Combin de Grafeneire) is 4,314 meters in height, while the neighbouring north- east summit (Aiguille du Croissant) is lower by less than 60 meters (4,260 metres). Two other minor summits over 4,000 metres are located on the ridge: the Grand Combin de Valsorey (4184 m) on the west and the Combin de la Tsessette (4135 m) on the east. On the west side, the plateau sinks to a considerably lower level, and over this lies the Col des Maisons Blanches (3,418 m), by which access to the Corbassiere valley is obtained from the side of the Val d'Entremont. All the waters flowing on the region end up in the Dranse river and the Rhone. After Dom, Weisshorn, it is the highest massif of the Alps situated out of the main chain. South of the Grand Combin, the ridge separating the glaciers of Mont Durand and Sonadon reaches the Grande Tête de By a few kilometres away, which is located on the main watershed and border with the Italian region of Aosta Valley. The ridge diverges to the south-west and appears to be continuous with the range of the Aiguilles Vertes, or Aiguilles de Valsorey, and that of Mont Vélan. From this branches the lower range, which divides the channel of the Glacier du Mont Durand (north) from the Val d'Ollomont in the Aosta Valley (south), and extends by the Col de Fenêtre to the Mont Gelé.John Ball, A guide to the Western Alps, p. 271, 1866, London == Climbing history == The Grand Combin, which yields in height to only a few European mountains, was long one of the least known of Alpine summits. The first to commence the exploration of the great massif which separates the Val de Bagnes from the Val d'Entremont was Gottlieb Samuel Studer, of Berne, who on August 14, 1851 reached for the first time the summit of the Combin de Corbassière with the guide Joseph-Benjamin Fellay,Combin de Corbassière bagnes.ch. Retrieved 2010-02-08 and has published an account of that and a subsequent excursion in Bergund Gletscher-Fahrten. He was followed in that ascent five years later by W. and C. E. Mathews, and in 1857, William Mathews anticipated Studer in the ascent of the second peak of the Grand Combin.John Ball, A guide to the Western Alps, p.271, 1866, London The first four expeditions on Grand Combin reached only the minor summit east of Grand Combin (Aiguille du Croissant). The first one was made by mountain guides from the valley (Maurice Fellay and Jouvence Bruchez) on July 20, 1857. The first complete ascent of Grand Combin was finally made on July 30, 1859 by Charles Sainte-Claire Deville with Daniel, Emmanuel and Gaspard Balleys, and Basile Dorsaz. The Grand Combin de Valsoray on the west was reached for the first time on 16 September 1872 by J. H. Isler and J. Gillioz. They climbed the south south face above the Plateau du Couloir. The itinerary on the south-east ridge was opened on 10 September 1891 by O. Glynne Jones, A.Bovier and P.

The capital city was destroyed by the invading Gurkha army and only the ruins of the palace and the chortens are seen here now. However, the ruins of this city are seen close to Pelling and in West Sikkim district in the Northeastern Indian state of present-day Sikkim; Pemayangtse Monastery is one of the oldest monasteries in Sikkim which is close to the ruins. From the vantage point of this former capital, superb views of the Khanchendzonga ranges can be witnessed. This monument has been declared as of national importance by the Archaeological Survey of India. It was first established in 1670 by Chadok Namgyal son of Phuntsog Namgyal by shifting from the first capital of Yuksom that was consecrated in 1642. The Rabdentse ruins are part of Buddhist religious pilgrimage circuit starting with the first monastery at Yuksom known as the Dubdi Monastery, followed by Norbugang Chorten, Tashiding Monastery, the Pemayangtse Monastery, the Sanga Choeling Monastery, and the Khecheopalri Lake. ==History== Phuntsog Namgyal, the first Chogyal or King of Sikkim, was consecrated as king of Sikkim at Yuksom and succeeded by his son, Tensung Namgyal in 1670. The reign of the Chogyal was peaceful and saw the capital shifted from Yuksom to Rabdentse. The Namgyal had three wives – a Tibetan, a Bhutanese and a Limbu girl. The Limbu girl, daughter of the Limbu chief Yo Yo-Hang had inducted seven girls from her family who all married into noble Sikkim families. Many of them became councillors to the King and were given the title Kazi, which gave them enormous powers and privileges. The king's second wife's son Chador Namgyal, took over the reins of power in Sikkim, after his father’s death, in 1700. He was a minor at that time. This outraged his elder half-sister Pendiongmu (daughter of first wife of Tensung Namgyal), of Bhutanese descent, who opposed the succession and with help from Bhutan evicted Chador. Chador fled to Tibet (Yungthing Yeshe, a loyal Minister escorted the minor king to Lhasa) where he remained in exile for ten years before returning and reclaiming his lost territory with the help of the Tibetans. While in Lhasa, Chador Namgyal became very proficient in Buddhism and Tibetan literature, and also became the state astrologer to the Sixth Dalai Lama. During his exile, the Sixth Dalai Lama pleased with the erudition of Chador Namgyal had conferred on him exclusive rights to an estate in Tibet. During this period, the son of Yugthing Yeshe (who had saved Chador and taken him to Tibet) was imprisoned by the Bhutanese in Rabdentse. Tibet intervened in the matter and also prevailed on King Deb of Bhutan to withdraw from Sikkim. Chador Namgyal then returned to Rebdantse and the small forces of Bhutan which remained were forced to withdraw. During this period, Sikkim lost some areas in its south-eastern region since Bhutan had colonized the area. Pedi, the Chogyal’s half sister, had not given up on her enmity against her half brother Chador. With the help of a medicinal man from Tibet she got Chador Namgyal murdered in 1716 through a mysterious blood letting from a main artery while the king was on a holiday at the Ralang hot water spring. Immediately, the royal armed forces executed the Tibetan doctor and also put Pedi to death by strangling her with a silk scarf. Gurmed Namgyal succeeded his father Chadok in 1717. Gurmed's reign saw many skirmishes between the Nepalese and Sikkimese. He had Rabdentse fortified to prevent invasions by the Gurkhas (Nepalese) and Bhutanese. In addition, a local Magar chieftain Tashi Bidur had also rebelled, but was subdued. Gurmed died in 1733 at a young age of 26. Since he did not have any legitimate children, on his death bed he conveyed that a nun at Sanga Cheoling was carrying his child (this is said to be the story concocted by the Lamas to perpetuate the Namgyal Dynasty). Subsequently, the nun gave birth to a male child who was accepted as heir to Gurmed and was given the name Phuntsog, after the first temporal and the spiritual head of Sikkim. Phunstog Namgyal II, the illegitimate child of Gurmed, succeeded his father to the throne in 1733. His reign was tumultuous as he was faced with attacks by the Bhutanese and the Nepalese, apart from rebellions within Sikkim from Magars and the Tsongs in 1752. Since Namgyal II was a weak king, the Nepalese had made 17 invasions against Sikkim. Bhutan had also attacked Sikkim and occupied areas east of Tista River; however, they later withdrew to present frontiers after negotiations held at Rhenock. Tenzing Namgyal, the next king was also a weak ruler, and his sovereignty saw most of Sikkim being appropriated by Nepal. The Chogyal was forced to flee from Rabdentse to Lhasa where he died in 1780. Tshudpud Namgyal, his son returned to Sikkim in 1793 to reclaim the throne with the help of China. Finding Rabdentse too close to the Nepalese border, he shifted the capital to Tumlong. Consequent to the repeated attacks by the Bhutanese and Nepalese over the many invasions, the capital city was reduced to ruins by the liberating army of Nepal. ==Structures== The Three Chortens where the Royal family of Sikkim used to offer prayers to their deities at Rabdentse palace The ruins seen now in Rabdentse consist mainly of \\"chunky wall stubs\\" whose heritage value is accentuated by its location on a ridge, near upper Pelling ( away) from where commanding views of the Kanchendzong hill ranges and surroundings on one side and the mountains and valleys on the other side are visible. The approach to this location is from an ornamental yellow gate near the Pelling–Geyshing road, from where it is a walking distance of about 15 minutes through a lake and forested hills. Along the trek path from the gate, an avenue of chestnut trees with sodden moss leads to a stone throne comprising three standing stones called as \\"Namphogang\\", which was the pulpit of the judges from where judgments were pronounced during the active days of the king's reign from Rabdentse. Further ahead, the 'Taphap Chorten' is seen in semi ruined condition. This was the entry point to the Palace and people seeking access to the palace had to dismount from their horses and remove their hat as a mark of respect to the King here. The palace ruins are at the centre of the fourth courtyard. The ruins of the palace are made up two of the northern and southern wings. The northern wing was the residence of the royal family. This wing has an open quadrangle where the \\"Dab Lhagang\\", now in ruins, is also seen; the Royal family used to offer prayers with incense to their deities here. A white marble slab of size x (reported to have been shifted from the river and carried by single person ) is also seen at this location, which was once the location of the monastery known as \\"Risum Gompa\\". Next to the ruins of the palace are three chortens, religious sites where members of the royal family offered incense to the deities. The chortens are in a fair state of preservation. On the southern wing, common people were given an audience by the king, which is obvious from the stone throne seen here. The Archaeological Survey of India has declared Rabdentse as a heritage monument and has undertaken the needed preservation and restoration measures. ==See also== * History of Sikkim ==References== ==External links== *Coordinates of Rabdentse Category:Sikkim Category:Cities and towns in West Sikkim district ","title":"Rabdentse"},{"id":"2234079","text":"Patrick Andrew Collins (March 12, 1844 - September 13, 1905) was a U.S. Representative from Massachusetts and Mayor of Boston from 1902 until his death. ==BiographyEarly life=== Collins was born March 12, 1844, near Fermoy, County Cork, Ireland (then a part of the U.K.).

In 1988, Breukink won the youth competition in the Tour de France. In 1990, Breukink reached the podium in Paris, finishing 3rd in the 1990 Tour de France. Most recently, he served as the manager of the team. ==BiographyAmateur cycling years=== Born in Rheden, Breukink was born in a cycling family, as his father Willem Breukink was director of the Gazelle bicycle factory. Despite this, he chose to be a footballer. In 1980 he changed to pursue a cycling career. In 1982, this appeared to be a good choice, when he won the Dutch national pursuit championship for juniors. At the 1984 Olympic Games, Erik Breukink competed with Gert Jakobs, Maarten Ducrot and Jos Alberts in the 100 km Team Pursuit and finish fourth place.Official results 1984 Olympic Games In 1985, Breukink won 2 time trial stages in Olympia's Tour, and finished 3rd place overall. He decided to switch to a professional career. ===Professional cycling years=== Dutch national champion at the 1993 Tour de France Breukink made his debut as a pro in 1986 for the Skala-Gazelle team. He turned out to be a time trial specialist and was a good climber. In his Tour de France debut in 1987, he won one stage and finished second in the young rider classification. His real breakthrough in the major courses was the 1988 Giro d'Italia, where he debuted with a 2nd place, winning the Gavia Pass stage in a snowstorm. In the 1988 Tour de France he won the young rider classification and finished 13th place. In the 1989 Tour de France, he showed his time trial skills by winning the prologue, and wearing the yellow jersey for one day. In that year's Giro d'Italia, he almost won, but lost the lead in the Dolomites due to hunger. In 1990, Breukink wanted to focus on the Tour de France, so he switched to the PDM team, that allowed him to do so. In the 1990 Tour de France, the result was good, winning two stages and finishing 3rd overall. The result could even have been better, but Breukink suffered from some bad luck: in the climb to the Tourmalet Breukink had to switch bicycles three times. In 1991, Breukink together with the entire PDM-team had to leave the tour ranked 3rd, officially due to food poisoning, but it was later exposed that it was due to Intralipid.Terug naar ... 16 juli 1991Dutch Drugs Scandal – Part 6 In 1992, he appeared weak, especially in his favourite time trials. In 1993, Breukink switched to the team, where his performance improved again. Bad luck followed him however, as just before the start of the 1993 Tour de France, he was hit by a car test riding the new Lotus 110. The damage to his left knee caused him to give up during the Tour. Breukink rode the Tour de France four times afterwards, but never reached his old level. In 1997 he ended his professional cycling career, having ridden 11 Tours de France and won 4 stages. He garnered 61 career victories in total. ===Sports commentator=== After one year as a Public Relations officer for the Rabobank- team, Breukink started as co-commentator for the NOS, covering the Tour de France.

He served on the Houston City Council, served two terms as Mayor of Houston, and served three terms in the Texas House of Representatives. ==Early life== John Thomas Browne was born March 23, 1845 in Ballylanders, County Limerick, Ireland to Michael and Winifred (Hennessy) Browne. His family emigrated to the United States in October 1851. Not long after arriving in New Orleans, his father died. In 1852, Winifred relocated with her five children to Houston, Texas to be closer to family of her mother.(1895) A History of Texas and Texans, Together with a Biographical Sketch of the Cities of Houston and Galveston, Chicago: Lewis Publishing Company, p.384-385. Winifred's Irish uncle, Patrick Hayes, was an herbal medicine doctor and farmer in Madison County, Texas. Browne spent much of the 1850s on Spann Plantation in Washington County, Texas at the behest of Father Gunnard, where he also received an education. At age fourteen in 1859, he left the plantation, and found work hauling bricks in Madison County, Texas. He returned to Houston to first work as a baggage hauler, then performed messenger duties for Commercial and Southwestern Express Company before settling in at the Houston and Texas Central Railroad. The 1860 Census listed John residing with his mother in Houston's Fourth Ward. ==Civil War== Correction: The tombstone of Mayor John T. Browne in the City of Houston actually states that he served in Company A, 36 Texas Cavalry. Family history passed down that he was seriously wounded in a major battle of the Civil War, but recovered fully. Browne joined the Confederacy, officially serving in Company B of the Second Texas Infantry. He served in Houston, detached from his unit, maintaining employment with the Houston and Texas Central Railroad, but in a new capacity as a fireman. He was briefly dispatched to the defense of Galveston, Texas. He was officially released from military duty in Houston on June 27, 1865. ==Rise to the Merchant Class== Browne and Bollfrass Building Browne returned to messenger service in Houston after the Civil War. He worked for Adams Express Company, then for Southern Express Company. He transitioned into the grocery business first as a bookkeeper and clerk for H.P. Levy. Browne married Mary Jane \\"Mollie\\" Bergin on September 13, 1871. They were the first marriage to be recorded at Annunciation Catholic Church. In 1872, Browne and Charles Bollfrass started a business as wholesale and retail grocers with $500 in capital. By the early 1890s, this grocery was amassing about $340,000 in annual sales. He was a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians and the Knights of Columbus. ==Political Life== Browne was elected to Houston City Council, representing the Fifth Ward while chairing the Finance Committee in 1887. He ran for Mayor of Houston in 1892. He won in a landslide: 3900 to 600. During his time as mayor he lived in the Fifth Ward.West, Richard. \\"Only the Strong Survive.\\" Texas Monthly. Emmis Communications, February 1979. Volume 7, No. 2. ISSN 0148-7736. START: p. 94. CITED: p. 105. Browne's first term as Mayor of Houston began the same year as the Panic of 1893. He had campaigned on a platform of balancing the budget. The City of Houston ran budget deficits during Browne's first term, but these deficits were proportionately lower than those in previous years. Browne had been an advocate for lowering municipal utility bills through municipal ownership of the utilities. However, estimates for the City of Houston to build its own waterworks and electrical power plant had gone up to a range $500,000 to $900,000. Browne abandoned this option while favoring a policy of dedicating all capital spending on street paving and sewerage. The Browne administration also hired a city planning expert to study demands based hypothetically on a population of 75,000.Platt, Harold L. (1983). City Building in the New South, Philadelphia: Temple University Press, p.146-147. Mayor Browne proposed converting the Houston Volunteer Firefighters to a professional department under municipal management. The City of Houston would need to buy existing equipment and horses from the volunteer department, but could lease firehouses and would not be required to buy them. Houston City Council drafted an ordinance and passed it. In April 1895, the Texas Supreme Court ruling in Higgins v. Bordages, \\"held that special assessment tax liens were unenforceable against urban homesteads.\\"Platt, p.148. The City of Houston imposed special tax levies for road and sewerage projects on owners of property abutting the sections of street being improved. The ruling effectively removed the only tool the city had for enforcing payment of the special assessments by homeowners. Road construction contractors stopped all work because they feared the city would not pay them. Many homeowners stopped paying their assessment bills. To meet this immediate revenue crisis, the Browne administration devised a plan to issue $500,000 in municipal bonds to be sold over a three to four-year period. The Labor Council opposed the bonding measure, and organized to defeat the measure when the referendum made it to the ballot. The City of Houston would need to find another way to compensate for $300,000 in uncollected taxes.Platt, p.150. Browne represented Houston in the Texas House of Representatives from 1897 to 1899, and again in 1907. ==Death== Browne died on August 19, 1941 of pneumonia in Houston. He was buried at Glenwood Cemetery in Houston. He was survived by six children and thirty-eight grand children. In 1979 his former residence in the Fifth Ward was used by an Italian American-owned grocery, Orlando's Grocery. ==References== Category:1845 births Category:1941 deaths Category:Burials at Glenwood Cemetery (Houston, Texas) Category:People from County Limerick Category:Mayors of Houston Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Infectious disease deaths in Texas Category:Irish emigrants to the United States (before 1923) ","title":"John T.

The club are members of the and play at New Bucks Park. ==HistoryPrevious clubs in Bootle=== The original Bootle F.C. were formed in 1879 and played their first fixture in 1880 on Hawthorne Road, adjacent to Bootle Cricket Club. The club were Everton F.C.'s main rivals and competed with Everton for the prestigious place in the newly formed Football League. Because only one club per area were permitted to join, Bootle narrowly lost out, despite the fact that in the run up to the decision Everton were banned from the both the FA Cup and the Liverpool Senior Cup the previous year. However Bootle lost out and in 1889–90 Bootle became founder members of the Football Alliance, which became the newly formed Football League Second Division. That season was the most successful as the club finished league runners-up and reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, losing to Blackburn Rovers. When the Alliance merged with the Football League in 1892, Bootle became founder members of the new Second Division. However, despite finishing in a respectable 8th place, the club dropped out after one season due to ongoing financial problems. Ironically a new local club, Liverpool, took Bootle's place in the second division. The possible resurrection of a Bootle team became a distinct probability in August 1947 when local councillors identified the popularity and talent on show in the ‘Bootle JOC’ league and knew the town was big enough to be put back on the football map with its own team again. For years it had been an exporter of its many players to other clubs, both professional and semi-professional. The promise of sponsorship money from local businesses brought great optimism and the issue of one shilling shares further boosted club finances. After local residents were assured that the ground at Bootle Stadium (Maguire Avenue) would not be used solely as a football ground, an application to join the Lancashire Combination for the 1948/49 season was made, and accepted. Club colours even posed a problem; red or blue were dismissed for fear of showing favour to either of the ‘big two’ so it was agreed that, as the original Bootle FC wore white shorts, this colour would be adopted. Players mostly came from the local league and surrounding clubs, however one player that Bootle overlooked was a tall, blonde, ex-prisoner-of-war German, Bert Trautmann. Trautman, then living in Huyton, trained with Bootle at the stadium for several weeks but, with the area taking such a heavy pounding during the war, it was decided not to tempt any local bitterness and he was allowed to join St Helens Town and of course moved on to FA Cup and Manchester City folklore. They kicked off their new campaign in 1948 against Barnoldswick and district. The league was won at the first attempt. However, Bootle struggled in the top-flight and after several tough seasons and also a change in Council priorities they withdrew from the league and folded during the 1953–54 campaign. ===Modern club=== In 1953, the current club was formed as Langton with Frank Doran Senior and Ben Dunning being one of the founding members. The club played in the various local Bootle leagues. After a successful spell in the Liverpool County Combination, winning multiple leagues and cups, the club requested to change its name to the latest incarnation of Bootle FC. This was accepted in 1973 and a year later ‘the Bucks’ joined the Lancashire Combination. After winning the Combination in both 1976 and 1977, Bootle then joined the Second Division of the Cheshire County League, which was won in the first season, and were promoted to the First Division. In 1982 the Cheshire County League was one of the leagues that merged to form the North West Counties League, which Bootle duly joined, becoming a member of the First Division (Which is now called the Premier Division). The club spent most of their time in the First Division until 2000 when the club was relegated to the Second Division. However, despite finishing 6th in 2002, the club dropped into the Liverpool County Combination as Bucks Park on Copy Lane closed its doors for the final time. In 2006 the club, with a new ground on Vesty Road, were elected back into Division 2 of the North West Counties League. In 2009 Bootle won promotion to the NWCFL Premier Division and also won the Championship. In 2009/10, the first season back in the NWCFL Premier Division Bootle finished a NWCFL high for the first time reaching 3rd place. In 2010/11 finished 6th place. They equalled the 3rd place again in 2012. More success followed in 2013 when the club lifted the Liverpool Senior Cup. In 2017 Bootle finished runners-up for the first time in the NWCFL Premier Division, losing out to Atherton Collieries for the title. In 2019 the Bucks agonisingly missed out on the title yet again, finishing runner-up after a 20 match winning streak was halted by a final day draw at home to Northwich Victoria saw City of Liverpool claim the league. Since 1953 Frank Doran Senior has been the mainstay of this era for Bootle FC. Being a player, manager, secretary, grounds man, and now president of the club. And these foundations have been built on with a family and community spirit felt at the club. ==Notable former players== Players who have gone on to play for professional clubs include: *Lee Steele *Larry Carberry ==Honours== *North West Counties League **Division One champions 2008–09 *Cheshire County League **Division Two champions 1978–79 *Lancashire Combination **Champions 1975–76, 1976–77 *Liverpool Senior Cup **Winners 2012–13 *Liverpool County Football Combination **Champions 1964–65, 1965–66, 1967–68,1968–69, 1969–70, 1970–71,1971–72, 1972–73, 1973–74 *Liverpool Challenge Cup **Winners 1964–65, 1975–76,1978–79 *Liverpool Amateur Cup **Winners 1965–66, 1967–68,1973–74 ==Records== *Best FA Cup performance: Third Qualifying Round, 1990–91 *Best FA Vase performance: 4th Round, 2008–09 *North West Counties League Division 1 Champions 2008–09 ==ReferencesCategory:Football clubs in England Category:Football clubs in Merseyside Category:North West Counties Football League clubs Category:Sport in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton Category:1953 establishments in England Category:Lancashire Combination Category:Association football clubs established in 1953 Category:Bootle Category:Cheshire County League ","title":"Bootle F.C."},{"id":"2234137","text":"Pierre-Louis Charles de Failly (21 January 1810 - 15 November 1892) was a French general. He was born in Rozoy-sur-Serre, Aisne, the son of Count Charles-Louis de Failly (descendant of a family of ancient nobility from Lorraine), and of Sophie Desmons de Maigneux. He was educated at the Saint-Cyr and entered the army in 1828. In 1851 he had risen to the rank of colonel, and Napoleon III, with whom he was a favorite, made him general of brigade in 1854 and general of division in 1855, after which Failly was for a time his aide- de-camp. During the Crimean War he served in the siege of Sevastopol. During the Austro-Sardinian War he commanded the 3rd Infantry Division in the 4th Corps. In 1867 he led the French expeditionary corps sent to protect the Papal States with which he defeated Giuseppe Garibaldi at Mentana, this action being the first in which the chassepot rifle was used. Back in France, he was made a senator for life. In 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, Failly commanded the 5th Corps. His inactivity at Bitche on 6 August while the 1st Corps on his right and the 2nd Corps on his left were crushed at the battles of Wörth and Spicheren respectively, gave rise to the greatest indignation in France. Failly then commanded the right wing of Marshal de Mac-Mahon's Army of Châlons during the Sedan campaign, and the disastrous outcome of that campaign is partly ascribed to Failly's tactics, though he is certainly no more to blame than the other French generals. Failly and his 5th Corps were routed at Beaumont on 30 August 1870 by two corps led by George of Saxony. In this battle the French were surprised in their cantonments and driven back upon Mouzon. The defeat closed the southern escape route and forced the French Army of Châlons towards the Belgian frontier and encirclement at Sedan. He was captured by the Prussians at Sedan on 2 September, but was liberated some months later. The rest of his life was spent in retirement. He died at Compiègne, aged 82.

Productions were often out of doors, sometimes ticketed, sometimes freely viewable in public spaces. It is now defunct. == Production history == Redmoon Theater was founded in 1990 by puppeteer Blair Thomas and choreographer Lauri Macklin. In 1992, Macklin left and Thomas continued on his own until Jim Lasko joined the theater. Team garnered critical praise for their indoor theater productions of classic stories like Moby-Dick and Frankenstein, while beginning to explore how the same theatrical skills could activate outdoor spaces. Mr. Thomas left the theater in 1998, leaving it to Jim Lasko. In 2009, Mr. Lasko accepted a one- year appointment to become the Artist in Residence for the City of Chicago, and, after 13 years of working as an artist and community leader with the organization, Frank Maugeri assumed the role of Artistic Director. A year later, the duo joined forces to co-lead Redmoon. Redmoon has contributed to such projects as The Millennium Park Opening Ceremony, Art Institute Ground Breaking, the City of Chicago’s Looptopia Festival, and the 2009 Halloween celebrations before the First family. == Productions == The company has created theater productions, community projects and large-scale, site-specific performances, that have been experienced across Chicago from Belmont Harbor and the Jackson Park Lagoon to the façade of the Museum of Contemporary Art. Redmoon has also worked in traditional theater venues from the stage of Harris Theater to Steppenwolf. In addition, the company has produced international projects in the Netherlands, Ireland, France, and Australia. === Major works === For eight years (1995–2002), Redmoon produced All Hallows' Eve, a ritual performance during Halloween in Chicago's Logan Square neighborhood that in its final year brought an audience of over 10,000. In 2007, Redmoon created a large-scale commissioned work for the newly created festival Looptopia, which featured site installations throughout the Loop with a procession down Washington Street in a performance in Daley Plaza for more than 20,000 spectators. In 2010, co-produced by Redmoon Theater and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, \\"The Astronaut's Birthday,\\" a production reminiscent of a graphic novel, was projected onto the west façade of the MCA as audience members watched from the plaza. == Style == With this unique visual language, Redmoon Theater aspires to transform streets and stages into places of public celebration, capable of speaking across cultural, ethnic, and generational boundaries that focuses on contributing to civic well-being and social exchange. Highly influenced by contemporary art works and ancient theatrical forms, Redmoon Theater created a performance style that is part pageantry, gadgetry, acrobatics, and ephemera. == Critical reception == The company has been hailed by the Chicago Tribune as “impossibly inventive” and “full of visual wit,” and described by the Chicago Sun-Times as “one of the only theaters that can keep a 2-year-old and a 50-year-old equally enchanted and filled with wide-eyed wonder.” ==See also== *Antonio Sacre *Chris Lafferty ==References== Category:Theatre companies in Chicago ","title":"Redmoon Theater"},{"id":"2234168","text":"Escapist may refer to: *Escapist, a person engaged in the act of escapism *Escapist fiction ==Books== *The Escapists, novel by Alexander Fullerton 1972 ==Comics and games== *The Escapist (website), a role-playing-games advocacy website *The Escapist (magazine), an online magazine *The Escapist (character), a comic book character *The Escapists, a 2015 video game ==Film and TV== *The Escapist (1983 film), starring escape artist Bill Shirk *The Escapist (2002 film), directed by Gillies MacKinnon *The Escapist (2008 film), directed by Rupert Wyatt ==Music== *The Escapist (album) a 1996 album by Stephen Cummings *\\"The Escapist\\" (1998), an album by Phil Western *\\"The Escapist\\", hidden track on Coldplay's 2008 album Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends *\\"The Escapist\\", a single from The Streets' 2008 album Everything Is Borrowed *\\"Escapist\\", a song by Nightwish on their album Dark Passion Play ==See also== *Escapism (disambiguation) *Escapologist * * ","title":"Escapist"},{"id":"2234169","text":"Angelique Bouchard is a fictional character from the gothic horror-soap opera and film Dark Shadows, in which she is the main antagonist. She is primarily portrayed as a powerful witch driven by her vacillating love and hatred for Barnabas Collins. In the original TV series, the character was portrayed by Lara Parker, and appeared within several storylines of the series which aired from June 1966 through April 1971. Angelique was originally introduced to explain how Barnabas Collins became a vampire, but she proved popular enough in her own right to make many return appearances. She is portrayed by English actress Lysette Anthony in the 1991 revival TV series, and French actress Eva Green in the 2012 feature film directed by Tim Burton. ==Original history== Angélique was born as Miranda DuVal during the 17th century in the West Indies of Martinique. During her early teen years, Angélique travelled to America, where she became a faithful and loyal follower of a warlock named Judah Zachary. Judah took Angélique under his wing, and taught her the sacred arts of magic and witchcraft. One year later, both Angélique and Judah were captured and exposed as witches by the Catholic Church. Fearing her fate of death, Angélique betrayed Judah by testifying against him in exchange for her freedom. Miranda was later reincarnated as Angélique Bouchard. She was raised by Theodore Bouchard, who she believed to be her father, before coming to work for the duPres family. As Countess Natalie duPres' servant, she followed her to Collinsport, Maine. However, after having a brief affair with Barnabas Collins, Angélique was heartbroken after Barnabas declared his love to another woman - Josette du Prés. After countless failed attempts to rekindling her romance with Barnabas, Angélique hexed a powerful spell to manipulate Josette’s love for Jeremiah Collins, Barnabas’ uncle. After Josette eloped with Jeremiah, Angelique coerced Barnabas into marrying her. However, after the discovery of her practices in witchcraft, Barnabas supposedly murdered Angélique. Before her \\"death\\", Angélique cursed Barnabas as a species of the undead and fell into a coma where she was presumed to die. Later, after her surprising survival, Angélique was devastated about what she did to Barnabas, and tried to reverse her spell. She is the first victim of her own curse, being in love with Barnabas. He strangles her in the secret room of the mausoleum. Her soul is claimed by The Dark Lord in exchange for letting Barnabas continue existing as a vampire through her curse rather than perish. During the early spring of 1968, Angélique changed her name to Cassandra Blair, and became the second wife of Roger Collins. Roger introduced his new bride to his family. She received a lukewarm welcome and Barnabas (who immediately recognized his former estranged wife) never doubted her true identity. Later, throughout the first year of their marriage, the happily married couple grow further and further apart. As Roger begins to realize his mistake in marrying \\"Cassandra\\", Angélique has affairs with multiple men - most notably Tony Peterson - of whom Elizabeth Collins Stoddard finds in the middle of one such affair and threaten to tell Roger. However, before having the chance to expose \\"Cassandra\\", Angélique hexes Elizabeth with a spell that surrenders her into a deathlike state. Believing her to be dead, the Collins family unknowingly buries Elizabeth alive. She is destroyed by the Ghost of Reverend Trask, but is brought back from the dead and cursed as a vampire by Nicolas Blair. She attacks Joe Haskell on orders from Nicolas, and turns him into her slave. Then when Nicolas tells her she can have Barnabas, she no longer wants Joe and quits summoning him. She then turns on Barnabas and she bites him several times and turns him into her slave. Angelique traveled back to 1897 in order to further torment a time-traveling Barnabas. Initially a villain once more, she falls in love with Quentin Collins, and eventually becomes a firm ally in the enduring war against Andreas Petofi. Angelique's next storyline comes when she is discovered retired from witchcraft in 1970. After her marriage to Skyler Rumson, Angelique desired to live a normal life by renouncing her powers. After her encounter with Julia Hoffman, she claimed not be interested in the Collins family any longer. However, after the rise of the Leviathans, Barnabas sought her assistance and begged her for help. Though hesitant to practice magic again, Angelique reluctantly agreed. After the discovery of her husband’s allegiance to the Leviathans, Angelique abandoned Sky and took refuge in Collinsport at The Old House. A post-1795 Angelique is encountered in 1840 by Barnabas during his final TV storyline, where she has no knowledge of future events. Initially once more an antagonist, she eventually aids Barnabas against the threat of Judah Zachary and Lamar Trask, losing her powers in the process. Mortally wounded, she dies in Barnabas' arms, moments before he declares his love for her. ==Powers and abilities== *Conjuration: The act of calling, commanding, or summoning an object, person, or spirit already in existence. *Elemental Control: The act of controlling and manipulating the elements of air, earth, fire, water, and weather. *Mediumship: The act of calling, communicating, and invoking the spirits of the dead. *Necromancy: The act of controlling and manipulating the spirits of the dead. *Spell Casting: The act of changing and controlling events by magical influence. *Telekinesis: The act of controlling and manipulating the movements of objects and persons. *Voodoo: The act of controlling and manipulating another person through the use of dolls and wax figures. ==Books== In 1998, Lara Parker made her writing debut with the novel Angelique's Descent, which focused on Angelique’s early years in Martinique and her love affair with Barnabas Collins. In 2006, she released a sequel, The Salem Branch. She also wrote the introduction to the novel Dark Shadows: Dreams of the Dark (1999), written by Stephen Mark Rainey and Elizabeth Massie. Lara released Wolf Moon Rising in 2013 and noted there would be a fourth book in the series that focuses on Victoria Winters coming back to Collinwood after her return to 1795. ==2012 film== In the 2012 Dark Shadows film, Angelique (portrayed by French actress Eva Green) is an amazingly powerful and resilient witch, and a successful local businesswoman and community symbol. Her interest in Barnabas, after he is unwittingly released from her imprisonment, is again inflamed and she immediately seeks him out. In a single brief childhood scene establishing Angelique's early interest in Barnabas, the young Angelique (played by Raffey Cassidy) is shown with her mother, a servant, departing from Liverpool for \\"the New World\\" along with the Collins family. The childhood scene establishes, more intensively than the television series did, Angelique's class-based resentment of the Collins clan's privileges, for she is cautioned by her mother that she must accept her place, servitude, in the social structure of the time and not even gaze freely upon her \\"betters\\", including Barnabas. It is later learned that Angelique had caused the fatal accident that claimed Barnabas' parents' lives. ==External links== *Lara Parker Official Website Category:Dark Shadows characters Category:Female characters in film Category:Female horror film villains Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Fictional characters with earth or stone abilities Category:Fictional characters who can teleport Category:Fictional characters who use magic Category:Fictional necromancers Category:Fictional servants Category:Fictional spiritual mediums Category:Fictional telekinetics Category:Fictional witches Category:Television characters introduced in 1967 Category:Fictional characters with air or wind abilities Category:Fictional characters with water abilities Category:Fictional characters with weather abilities Category:Fictional characters with fire or heat abilities ","title":"Angelique Bouchard Collins"},{"id":"2234170","text":"\\"The Breeze and I\\" is a popular song.

In the novel, the Escapist is a fictional character created by the comics writer protagonists. The character later featured in the metafictional work Michael Chabon Presents the Amazing Adventures of the Escapist and Brian K. Vaughan's comic The Escapists. Chabon created the Escapist as an homage to the heroes of the Golden Age of Comic Books. The character's abilities as an escape artist are inspired by escape artist Harry Houdini as well as Robin Hood and Albert Schweitzer. Another inspiration was the early illusionist career of comic book artist Jim Steranko.real kavaliers & clays ==Publication historyKavalier and Clay=== Introduced in Chabon's novel in 2000, the Escapist is said to be the creation of the book's protagonists, the cousins Joe Kavalier and Sam Clay, a pair of Jewish comic book creators in the 1930s and 1940s. The character's modus operandi is part of a recurring theme of escapism in the novel, representing the imaginative and positive effects of escapism in superhero comics as well as Kavalier and Clay's attempts to escape from the troubles of their past. Joe Kavalier has fled to America from Nazi-occupied Prague in Europe, leaving the rest of his family behind. Unable to help them, he starts fleeing from himself and everyone trying to get close to him. Sam Clay also wants to escape from himself – both his polio-stricken body and repressed homosexuality. Within the story, the Escapist makes his first appearance in Amazing Midget Radio Comics #1, published by Empire Comics, a former novelty device company. He provides Kavalier and Clay with a measure of success and fame. However, having signed the rights to the character to the publisher, they make comparatively little from the massively successful character. ===Comics adaptation=== Writer Brian K. Vaughan signing a copy of the comics adaptation at Midtown Comics in Manhattan In 2004, Chabon teamed with Dark Horse Comics to create an actual comic book series of the Escapist. Named Michael Chabon Presents the Amazing Adventures of the Escapist, the comic chronicled the supposed decades-long publishing history of the character. The stories and text pieces were written with the concept that Kavalier and Clay were real people and that the Escapist had actually been a character from the Golden Age of Comics. As such, the stories in the anthology were frequently written and drawn in older or simpler styles, in homage to the comics of past eras. In addition to the Escapist himself, the comic featured stories of other characters supposedly created by Kavalier and Clay, such as the heroine Luna Moth and villains such as the gun-wielding Mr. Machine Gun or The Saboteur. The comic book won \\"Best Anthology\\" at the 2005 Eisner Awards. It is also notable for featuring the final story of The Spirit by the late Will Eisner, which appeared in issue #6 of The Escapist. In 2006, writer Brian K. Vaughan took on a 6-part mini-series titled The Escapists, which follows a longtime fan's dreams of reviving the character in all new comic adventures. Partly mirroring the story of Kavalier and Clay, The Escapists focuses on Cleveland- born Jewish writer Max Roth, whose late father was an avid Escapist fan. Using his inheritance money to buy the rights to the character, Max teams with artist Case Weaver and letterer Denny Jones, the latter of whom dresses as the Escapist and stops a crime in an attempt to stir up publicity for their comic. Inevitably, things begin to spiral out of the trio's control. ==Character history== The Escapist's true identity is Tom Mayflower. He is the crippled nephew of escape artist Max Mayflower (who performs under the stage name of Misterioso). When Max is fatally shot while performing onstage, he reveals that he isn't his real uncle, having rescued him from a cruel orphanage as a baby. He gives Tom a golden key and a costume, explaining that he was recruited long ago by a mysterious organization called the League of the Golden Key to fight tyranny and free the oppressed. With his dying breath, Max commissions Tom to carry on his work. As long as Tom is wearing the costume and the key, he finds that he is no longer lame of leg and can perform amazing feats of escapology. Tom uses his powers to fight crime under the guise of the Escapist, especially against the evil forces of the mysterious criminal network, the Iron Chain. Like The Shadow, the Escapist is assisted in his quest by specially gifted agents, his sidekicks, who include the former circus strongman Big Al, exotic Asian beauty Miss Plum Blossom, and Omar, an East Indian mystic who possesses the power of hypnosis. The Escapist is also sometimes aided by his benefactors, the League of the Golden Key, a secret society dedicated to freeing the oppressed and imprisoned. They are the source of the mystic key that grants the Escapist his powers, having granted it to Tom's uncle after freeing him from kidnappers when he was younger. During World War II, the League makes the Escapist an emergency Champion of Freedom and grant him full access to the powers of the Golden Key. This temporarily grants the Escapist superhuman strength and agility, allowing him to openly combat the Axis forces (coinciding in the novel with Joe Kavalier's feeling of helplessness as the war continues to rage on, while he is unable to rescue his family from Nazi-occupied Europe). Following the war, the Escapist's abilities return to their original level. In the comic-within-a-comic sequences of The Escapists, Tom's final fate is revealed and a new Escapist takes up the mantle of the hero. Things are not quite as they appear however. In a story meant to embody and comment on the darker \\"grim and gritty\\" trend of modern comics, the original Escapist is said to have been killed in action, leaving a young locksmith as his successor. The new Escapist is aided by a new Luna Moth, who claims to be the original Escapist's daughter. She is soon revealed as a fraud however and betrays him to his enemies. When all seems lost, the dark and violent world fades, revealed as a dream of Tom Mayflower, still very much alive. This coincides in the \\"real world\\" with Max Roth losing the rights to the Escapist to a corporation that prefers to revert the series to its classic style. ==References* *Interview with Michael Chabon about The Escapist Category:2004 comics debuts Category:Comics characters introduced in 2004 Category:Comics based on novels Category:Dark Horse Comics superheroes Category:Dark Horse Comics titles Category:Metafictional characters Category:Fictional escapologists Category:Fictional Jews in comics Category:Jewish superheroes ","title":"Escapist (character)"},{"id":"2234183","text":"Michael K.

Pro Wrestling's Greatest Secrets (under a mask as \\"Private Pain\\"). == Professional wrestling career == Modest began wrestling in 1991, and has worked for All Pro Wrestling, Universal Wrestling Association, and World Championship Wrestling (WCW), along with both AAA and Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) in Mexico. Modest had try-out matches for both the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and WCW, and eventually got signed to a WCW contract, although he was released after WWF bought WCW. After his release, he began working for Pro Wrestling Noah in Japan. In 2001, he also worked for Stampede Wrestling, and won the North American Heavyweight and Pacific Heavyweight titles. He was the last ever Pacific Heavyweight Champion. Modest also operated the Pro Wrestling IRON school and promotion in the USA, along with his tag team partner Donovan Morgan. He also briefly worked for Ring of Honor. On March 18, 2005, Modest won the Mike Lockwood Memorial Tournament held by New Breed Wrestling Association, defeating Jamie Noble in the finals.

Redox potential is measured in volts (V), or millivolts (mV). Each species has its own intrinsic redox potential; for example, the more positive the reduction potential (reduction potential is more often used due to general formalism in electrochemistry), the greater the species' affinity for electrons and tendency to be reduced. ORP can reflect the antimicrobial potential of the water. Trevor V. Suslow, 2004. Oxidation- Reduction Potential for Water Disinfection Monitoring, Control, and Documentation, University of California Davis, http://anrcatalog.ucdavis.edu/pdf/8149.pdf ==Measurement and interpretation == In aqueous solutions, redox potential is a measure of the tendency of the solution to either gain or lose electrons when it is subjected to change by introduction of a new species. A solution with a higher (more positive) reduction potential than the new species will have a tendency to gain electrons from the new species (i.e. to be reduced by oxidizing the new species) and a solution with a lower (more negative) reduction potential will have a tendency to lose electrons to the new species (i.e. to be oxidized by reducing the new species). Because the absolute potentials are next to impossible to accurately measure, reduction potentials are defined relative to a reference electrode. Reduction potentials of aqueous solutions are determined by measuring the potential difference between an inert sensing electrode in contact with the solution and a stable reference electrode connected to the solution by a salt bridge. The sensing electrode acts as a platform for electron transfer to or from the reference half cell; it is typically made of platinum, although gold and graphite can be used as well. The reference half cell consists of a redox standard of known potential. The standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) is the reference from which all standard redox potentials are determined, and has been assigned an arbitrary half cell potential of 0.0 mV. However, it is fragile and impractical for routine laboratory use. Therefore, other more stable reference electrodes such as silver chloride and saturated calomel (SCE) are commonly used because of their more reliable performance. Although measurement of the redox potential in aqueous solutions is relatively straightforward, many factors limit its interpretation, such as effects of solution temperature and pH, irreversible reactions, slow electrode kinetics, non-equilibrium, presence of multiple redox couples, electrode poisoning, small exchange currents, and inert redox couples. Consequently, practical measurements seldom correlate with calculated values. Nevertheless, reduction potential measurement has proven useful as an analytical tool in monitoring changes in a system rather than determining their absolute value (e.g. process control and titrations). ==Explanation== Similar to how the concentration of hydrogen ion determines the acidity or pH of an aqueous solution, the tendency of electron transfer between a chemical species and an electrode determines the redox potential of an electrode couple. Like pH, redox potential represents how easily electrons are transferred to or from species in solution. Redox potential characterises the ability under the specific condition of a chemical species to lose or gain electrons instead of the amount of electrons available for oxidation or reduction. In fact, it is possible to define pe, the negative logarithm of electron concentration (−log[e−]) in a solution, which will be directly proportional to the redox potential.1981 Stumm, W. and Morgan, J. J. (1981): Aquatic chemistry, 2nd Ed.; John Wiley & Sons, New York. Sometimes pe is used as a unit of reduction potential instead of E_h, for example, in environmental chemistry. If we normalize pe of hydrogen to zero, we will have the relation pe = 16.9 E_h at room temperature. This point of view is useful for understanding redox potential, although the transfer of electrons, rather than the absolute concentration of free electrons in thermal equilibrium, is how one usually thinks of redox potential. Theoretically, however, the two approaches are equivalent. Conversely, one could define a potential corresponding to pH as a potential difference between a solute and pH neutral water, separated by porous membrane (that is permeable to hydrogen ions). Such potential differences actually do occur from differences in acidity on biological membranes. This potential (where pH neutral water is set to 0 V) is analogous with redox potential (where standardized hydrogen solution is set to 0 V), but instead of hydrogen ions, electrons are transferred across in the redox case. Both pH and redox potentials are properties of solutions, not of elements or chemical compounds themselves, and depend on concentrations, temperature etc. ==Standard reduction potential== The standard reduction potential (E_{0}) is measured under standard conditions: 25 °C, a 1 activity for each ion participating in the reaction, a partial pressure of 1 bar for each gas that is part of the reaction, and metals in their pure state. The standard reduction potential is defined relative to a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) reference electrode, which is arbitrarily given a potential of 0.00 V. However, because these can also be referred to as \\"redox potentials\\", the terms \\"reduction potentials\\" and \\"oxidation potentials\\" are preferred by the IUPAC. The two may be explicitly distinguished in symbols as E_{0}^{r} and E_{0}^{o}. ==Half cells== The relative reactivities of different half cells can be compared to predict the direction of electron flow. A higher E_{0} means there is a greater tendency for reduction to occur, while a lower one means there is a greater tendency for oxidation to occur. Any system or environment that accepts electrons from a normal hydrogen electrode is a half cell that is defined as having a positive redox potential; any system donating electrons to the hydrogen electrode is defined as having a negative redox potential. E_{h} is measured in millivolts (mV). A high positive E_{h} indicates an environment that favors oxidation reaction such as free oxygen. A low negative E_{h} indicates a strong reducing environment, such as free metals. Sometimes when electrolysis is carried out in an aqueous solution, water, rather than the solute, is oxidized or reduced. For example, if an aqueous solution of NaCl is electrolyzed, water may be reduced at the cathode to produce H2(g) and OH− ions, instead of Na+ being reduced to Na(s), as occurs in the absence of water. It is the reduction potential of each species present that will determine which species will be oxidized or reduced. Absolute reduction potentials can be determined if we find the actual potential between electrode and electrolyte for any one reaction. Surface polarization interferes with measurements, but various sources give an estimated potential for the standard hydrogen electrode of 4.4 V to 4.6 V (the electrolyte being positive.) Half-cell equations can be combined if one is reversed to an oxidation in a manner that cancels out the electrons to obtain an equation without electrons in it. ==Nernst equation== The E_h and pH of a solution are related. For a half cell equation, conventionally written as reduction (electrons on the left side): : a A + b B + n [e^{-}] + h [\\\\ce{H+}] = c C + d D. The half-cell standard potential E_0 is given by : E_0 (\\\\text{volts}) = -\\\\frac{\\\\Delta G^\\\\ominus}{nF}, where \\\\Delta G^\\\\ominus is the standard Gibbs free energy change, is the number of electrons involved, and is Faraday's constant. The Nernst equation relates pH and E_h: : E_h = E_0 + \\\\frac{0.05916}{n} \\\\log\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\\\\\{A\\\\\\\\}^a\\\\\\\\{B\\\\\\\\}^b}{\\\\\\\\{C\\\\\\\\}^c\\\\\\\\{D\\\\\\\\}^d}\\\\right) - \\\\frac{0.05916\\\\,h}{n} \\\\text{pH}, where curly brackets indicate activities, and exponents are shown in the conventional manner. This equation is the equation of a straight line for E_h as a function of pH with a slope of -0.05916\\\\,h/n volt (pH has no units). This equation predicts lower E_h at higher pH values. This is observed for reduction of O2 to OH− and for reduction of H+ to H2. If H+ were on the opposite side of the equation from H+, the slope of the line would be reversed (higher E_h at higher pH). An example of that would be the formation of magnetite (Fe3O4) from HFeO: : 3 + H+ = Fe3O4 \\\\+ 2 H2O + 2 e−, where . Note that the slope of the line is −1/2 of the −0.05916 value above, since . == Biochemistry == Many enzymatic reactions are oxidation–reduction reactions, in which one compound is oxidized and another compound is reduced. The ability of an organism to carry out oxidation–reduction reactions depends on the oxidation–reduction state of the environment, or its reduction potential (E_h). Strictly aerobic microorganisms are generally active at positive E_h values, whereas strict anaerobes are generally active at negative E_h values. Redox affects the solubility of nutrients, especially metal ions. There are organisms that can adjust their metabolism to their environment, such as facultative anaerobes. Facultative anaerobes can be active at positive Eh values, and at negative Eh values in the presence of oxygen-bearing inorganic compounds, such as nitrates and sulfates. == Environmental chemistry == In the field of environmental chemistry, the reduction potential is used to determine if oxidizing or reducing conditions are prevalent in water or soil, and to predict the states of different chemical species in the water, such as dissolved metals. pe values in water range from -12 to 25; the levels where the water itself becomes reduced or oxidized, respectively. The reduction potentials in natural systems often lie comparatively near one of the boundaries of the stability region of water. Aerated surface water, rivers, lakes, oceans, rainwater and acid mine water, usually have oxidizing conditions (positive potentials). In places with limitations in air supply, such as submerged soils, swamps and marine sediments, reducing conditions (negative potentials) are the norm. Intermediate values are rare and usually a temporary condition found in systems moving to higher or lower pe values. In environmental situations, it is common to have complex non-equilibrium conditions between a large number of species, meaning that it is often not possible to make accurate and precise measurements of the reduction potential. However, it is usually possible to obtain an approximate value and define the conditions as being in the oxidizing or reducing regime. In the soil there are two main redox constituents: 1) anorganic redox systems (mainly ox/red compounds of Fe and Mn) and measurement in water extracts; 2) natural soil samples with all microbial and root components and measurement by direct method [Husson O. et al.: Practical improvements in soil redox potential (E_{h}) measurement for characterisation of soil properties. Application for comparison of conventional and conservation agriculture cropping systems. Anal. Chim. Acta 906 (2016): 98-109]. ==Water quality== Oxidation reduction potential (ORP) can be used for water system monitoring with the benefit of a single-value measure of the disinfection potential, showing the activity of the disinfectant rather than the applied dose. For example, E. coli, Salmonella, Listeria and other pathogens have survival times of under 30 s when the ORP is above 665 mV, compared against >300 s when it is below 485 mV. A study was conducted comparing traditional parts per million chlorination reading and ORP in Hennepin County, Minnesota. The results of this study argue for the inclusion of ORP above 650mV in local health codes. ==Geology== Eh–pH (Pourbaix) diagrams are commonly used in mining and geology for assessment of the stability fields of minerals and dissolved species. Under the conditions where a mineral (solid) phase is predicted to be the most stable form of an element, these diagrams show that mineral. As the predicted results are all from thermodynamic (at equilibrium state) evaluations, these diagrams should be used with caution. Although the formation of a mineral or its dissolution may be predicted to occur under a set of conditions, the process may practically be negligible because its rate is too slow. Consequently, kinetic evaluations at the same time are necessary. Nevertheless, the equilibrium conditions can be used to evaluate the direction of spontaneous changes and the magnitude of the driving force behind them. ==See also== * Galvanic cell * Electrolytic cell * Electromotive force * Electrochemical potential * Standard electrode potential * Solvated electron ** Table of standard electrode potentials * Oxygen radical absorbance capacity * Redox * Fermi level == Weblinks == * Online Calculator Redoxpotential („Redox Compensation”) == References == ==Additional notes== == External links == * Redox potential definition * Large table of potentials (Site broken.

High voltage is applied to a liquid supplied through an emitter (usually a glass or metallic capillary). Ideally the liquid reaching the emitter tip forms a Taylor cone, which emits a liquid jet through its apex. Varicose waves on the surface of the jet lead to the formation of small and highly charged liquid droplets, which are radially dispersed due to Coulomb repulsion. ==History== In the late 16th century William GilbertGilbert, W. (1628) De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure (On the Magnet and Magnetic Bodies, and on That Great Magnet the Earth), London, Peter Short set out to describe the behaviour of magnetic and electrostatic phenomena. He observed that, in the presence of a charged piece of amber, a drop of water deformed into a cone. This effect is clearly related to electrosprays, even though Gilbert did not record any observation related to liquid dispersion under the effect of the electric field. In 1750 the French clergyman and physicist Jean-Antoine (Abbé) Nollet noted water flowing from a vessel would aerosolize if the vessel was electrified and placed near electrical ground. He also noted that similarly \\"a person, electrified by connection to a high- voltage generator, would not bleed normally if he were to cut himself; blood would spray from the wound\\". In 1882, Lord Rayleigh theoretically estimated the maximum amount of charge a liquid droplet could carry; this is now known as the \\"Rayleigh limit\\". His prediction that a droplet reaching this limit would throw out fine jets of liquid was confirmed experimentally more than 100 years later. In 1914, John Zeleny published work on the behaviour of fluid droplets at the end of glass capillaries. This report presents experimental evidence for several electrospray operating regimes (dripping, burst, pulsating, and cone-jet). A few years later, Zeleny captured the first time- lapse images of the dynamic liquid meniscus. Between 1964 and 1969 Sir Geoffrey Ingram Taylor produced the theoretical underpinning of electrospraying. Taylor modeled the shape of the cone formed by the fluid droplet under the effect of an electric field; this characteristic droplet shape is now known as the Taylor cone. He further worked with J. R. Melcher to develop the \\"leaky dielectric model\\" for conducting fluids.Melcher, J. R. & Taylor, G. (1969) Electrohydrodynamics: A Review of the Role of Interfacial Shear Stresses. Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics, 1, 111-146 ==Mechanism== A close-up of an electrospray device. The jet of ionised spray is visible within the image. To simplify the discussion, the following paragraphs will address the case of a positive electrospray with the high voltage applied to a metallic emitter. A classical electrospray setup is considered, with the emitter situated at a distance d\\\\, from a grounded counter-electrode. The liquid being sprayed is characterized by its viscosity (\\\\mu)\\\\,, surface tension (\\\\gamma)\\\\,, conductivity (\\\\kappa)\\\\,, and relative permittivity (\\\\epsilon_r)\\\\,. ===Effect of small electric fields on liquid menisci=== Under the effect of surface tension, the liquid meniscus assumes a semi-spherical shape at the tip of the emitter. Application of the positive voltage V\\\\, will induce the electric field: :E={2V \\\\over r \\\\ln(4d/r)} where r\\\\, is the liquid radius of curvature. This field leads to liquid polarization: the negative/positive charge carriers migrate toward/away from the electrode where the voltage is applied. At voltages below a certain threshold, the liquid quickly reaches a new equilibrium geometry with a smaller radius of curvature. ===The Taylor cone=== Voltages above the threshold draw the liquid into a cone. Sir Geoffrey Ingram Taylor described the theoretical shape of this cone based on the assumptions that (1) the surface of the cone is an equipotential surface and (2) the cone exists in a steady state equilibrium. To meet both of these criteria the electric field must have azimuthal symmetry and have R^{1/2}\\\\, dependence to balance the surface tension and produce the cone. The solution to this problem is: :V=V_0+AR^{1/2}P _{1/2} (\\\\cos\\\\theta _0)\\\\, where V=V_0\\\\, (equipotential surface) exists at a value of \\\\theta _0 (regardless of R) producing an equipotential cone. The magic angle necessary for V=V_0\\\\, for all R is a zero of the Legendre polynomial of order 1/2, P _{1/2} (\\\\cos\\\\theta _0)\\\\,. There is only one zero between 0 and \\\\pi\\\\, at 130.7099°, which is the complement of the Taylor's now famous 49.3° angle. ===Singularity development=== The apex of the conical meniscus cannot become infinitely small. A singularity develops when the hydrodynamic relaxation time \\\\tau_H={\\\\mu r \\\\over \\\\gamma} becomes larger than the charge relaxation time \\\\tau_C={\\\\epsilon_r\\\\epsilon_0 \\\\over \\\\kappa}. The undefined symbols stand for characteristic length (r)\\\\, and vacuum permittivity (\\\\epsilon_0)\\\\,. Due to intrinsic varicose instability, the charged liquid jet ejected through the cone apex breaks into small charged droplets, which are radially dispersed by the space-charge. ===Closing the electrical circuit=== The charged liquid is ejected through the cone apex and captured on the counter electrode as charged droplets or positive ions. To balance the charge loss, the excess negative charge is neutralized electrochemically at the emitter. Imbalances between the amount of charge generated electrochemically and the amount of charge lost at the cone apex can lead to several electrospray operating regimes. For cone-jet electrosprays, the potential at the metal/liquid interface self-regulates to generate the same amount of charge as that lost through the cone apex. ==ApplicationsElectrospray ionization=== Electrospray became widely used as ionization source for mass spectrometry after the Fenn group successfully demonstrated its use as ion source for the analysis of large biomolecules. ===Liquid metal ion source=== A liquid metal ion source (LMIS) uses electrospray in conjunction with liquid metal to form ions. Ions are produced by field evaporation at tip of the Taylor cone. Ions from a LMIS are used in ion implantation and in focused ion beam instruments. ===Electrospinning=== Similarly to the standard electrospray, the application of high voltage to a polymer solution can result in the formation of a cone-jet geometry. If the jet turns into very fine fibers instead of breaking into small droplets, the process is known as electrospinning . ===Colloid thrusters=== Electrospray techniques are used as low thrust electric propulsion rocket engines to control satellites, since the fine-controllable particle ejection allows precise and effective thrust. ===Deposition of particles for nanostructures=== Electrospray may be used in nanotechnology, for example to deposit single particles on surfaces. This is done by spraying colloids on average containing only one particle per droplet. The solvent evaporates, leaving an aerosol stream of single particles of the desired type. The ionizing property of the process is not crucial for the application but may be used in electrostatic precipitation of the particles. ===Deposition of ions as precursors for nanoparticles and nanostructures=== Instead of depositing nanoparticles, nanoparticles and nano structures can also fabricated in situ by depositing metal ions to desired locations. Electrochemical reduction of ions to atoms and in situ assembly was believed to be the mechanism of nano structure formation. ===Fabrication of drug carriers=== Electrospray has garnered attention in the field of drug delivery, and it has been used to fabricate drug carriers including polymer microparticles used in immunotherapy as well as lipoplexes used for nucleic acid delivery. The sub-micrometer-sized drug particles created by electrospray possess increased dissolution rates, thus increased bioavailability due to the increased surface area. The side-effects of drugs can thus be reduced, as smaller dosage is enough for the same effect. ===Air purifiers=== Electrospray is used in some air purifiers. Particulate suspended in air can be charged by aerosol electrospray, manipulated by an electric field, and collected on a grounded electrode. This approach minimizes the production of ozone which is common to other types of air purifiers. ==See also== *Flow focusing ==References== Category:Electric and magnetic fields in matter Category:Industrial equipment Category:Aerosols ","title":"Electrospray"},{"id":"2234217","text":"\\"Pigs\\" As depicted by \\"Spy\\" (Leslie Ward) in Vanity Fair, 21 December 1878 Charles Seely (3 October 1803 – 21 October 1887) was a 19th-century industrialist and British Liberal Party politician, who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Lincoln from 1847 to 1848 and again from 1861 to 1885. He was one of the wealthiest industrialists of the Victorian era. ==Personal life== Seely was born and educated in Lincoln. His parents were Charles Seely (1768–1809) and Ann Wilkinson of Lincoln. He married Mary Hilton in 1831. ==Hosting Garibaldi== In 1864, Seely was the Deputy Lieutenant for Lincolnshire, when he played host to the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi, when Garibaldi visited 26 Prince's Gate Hyde Park, his house in London and Seely's estate at Brook House on the Isle of Wight. Garibaldi stayed at Brook House from 3 to 11 April, during which time he was also joined by Giuseppe Mazzini, the Italian writer and politician whose efforts helped bring about the modern Italian state. During this time Garibaldi raised funds for his Italian campaigns. On 11 April Garibaldi left Brook House with Seely and travelled from Southampton to London, where he was greeted by crowds estimated at half a million people, according to the Illustrated London News. Garibaldi stayed several days at Seely's house in London where a reception was hosted for him on 19 April. The next day he travelled to the Guildhall where he was given the Freedom of the City of London. ==Wealth== Seely made his fortune in the Industrial Revolution through milling, agricultural machinery and coal mining. On his death in 1887, \\"his personal estate was valued at almost £500,000, and real estate worth £2 million\\", equivalent to 322 million UK Pounds in 2018 or 2 billion UK pounds as a proportion of UK GDP.https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary- policy/inflation/inflation-calculator, https://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/ukcompare/\\"Mark Acton and Stephen Roberts\\" (2019) He was chairman of the House of Commons Committee on Admiralty Reform in 1868. In a Vanity Fair \\"Spy\\" cartoon of 1878, on notable people of the day, he was caricatured as \\"Pigs\\". He later diversified his fortune into acquiring coal mines and property: in 1883 he owned 9,264 acres on the Isle of Wight,John Bateman, The Great Landowners of Great Britain and Ireland, London, 1876, page 400. 2,929 in Worcestershire and 394 in Bedfordshire. By 1900 the family estates in the Isle of Wight comprised almost the entire west side of the island. In the 1870s he commissioned Myles Birket Foster to paint 50 watercolours of Venice. ==Descendants== Five other members of his family became Members of Parliament during the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries: * His grandson, the Secretary of State for War (1912–1914), Major General John Edward Bernard Seely, 1st Baron Mottistone. * His eldest son Sir Charles Seely, 1st Baronet. * His grandson Sir Charles Seely, 2nd Baronet. * His great-grandson the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Air (1941–1945) Sir Hugh Seely 3rd Baronet, and 1st Baron Sherwood. * His great-great-great-grandson Bob Seely was elected in 2017 as Member of Parliament for the Isle of Wight. Additionally, his great-grandson David Peter Seely, 4th Baron Mottistone, who was baptised with Winston Churchill and the then Prince of Wales (subsequently Edward VIII) as his godparents, was the Deputy Lieutenant for Lincolnshire, Lord Lieutenant of the Isle of Wight and its last Governor. His youngest sister Jane Anne Seely married (1882) Henry George Gore-Browne who received the Victoria Cross during the Indian Mutiny in 1857. Henry was a great-great grandson of the 1st Earl of Altamont MP, whose heir is the Marquess of Sligo. == References == ==Sources== * Mark Acton and Stephen Roberts (2019), Charles Seely of Lincoln.

Initial Palestinian planning had called for an attack against the Israeli tourist city of Nahariya, yet the team was apparently unable to locate the city on the night of a previous attempt, two months earlier. The operation's objectives were then changed to the Manshiya Neighborhood Youth Club and the Tel Aviv Opera Building. The contingency plan in case the original targets could not be located was to select any nearby buildings that were populated as targets. The attackers were told to take hostages, then demand the release of Palestinian prisoners, as well as air transport out of Israel to Damascus. If the negotiations failed, they were told to kill their hostages and commit suicide. In the event of capture, they were instructed to tell their interrogators that they had come from Egypt, in the hope that this would result in a breakdown of ongoing Israeli-Egyptian peace negotiations, and to direct Israeli retaliation away from Lebanon.Terrorist Suicide Operation Analysis. Shai Avital. Globalsecurity.org ==The attack== The vessel that transported the attackers At 11:00 p.m. on the night of 4 March 1975, eight Palestinians in two teams landed by boat on the Tel Aviv beach at the foot of Allenby Street. They had departed from the Lebanese port of Sarafenda, near Tyre on an Egyptian merchant vessel. When they were about 60 miles off Tel Aviv, the teams were lowered in a boat, and landed on the shore. As they landed on the shore, they were spotted by police officers in a patrol vehicle that was passing by. The officers in the car opened fire at them, and one of the boats which was stocked with weapons was hit and exploded. The militants escaped the beach onto a street corner, leaving much of their weaponry behind in the boats. They then crossed onto Herbert Samuel Street, where they shot and threw grenades. Unable to locate their original targets, they tried but failed to break into a cinema. Afterwards, they continued down the street and took over the Savoy Hotel, at the corner of HaYarkon and Geula streets, near the center of the city. The Savoy Hotel was picked due to it being the only illuminated building on the street. During the takeover of the hotel, three people were killed. Three people managed to escape in the confusion, but most guests and staff were taken hostage and taken to the top floor of the building. Private Moshe Deutschmann, a soldier from the Israeli army's Golani Brigade who was on home leave at the time, grabbed his weapon and ran to the hotel after hearing gunfire. Meanwhile, some militants attempted to leave the hotel. Deutschmann saw them at the entrance to the hotel and engaged them. In the exchange of fire, Deutschmann was hit. He managed to crawl away, and was later evacuated to Hadassah Medical Center, where he died of his injuries. Deutschmann was posthumously awarded the Medal of Distinguished Service. Israeli security forces soon arrived on the scene, and the Palestinians barricaded themselves in the hotel with their hostages, detonated an explosive charge which caused part of the building to collapse, and threatened that if Israel did not release 20 Palestinian prisoners within four hours, the hostages would be executed. According to an eyewitness account: > When I went into the street, I saw a nightmarish spectacle. Red tracer > bullets streaked through the night air. The four-story Savoy Hotel, > illuminated by floodlights, was surrounded by troops, local police and > border police in full battle regalia. Military vehicles, armored cars and > personnel carriers clogged the surrounding streets. Red Magen David > ambulance crews were administering first aid to wounded civilians on the > sidewalks and gutters. Looking out to sea, the blinding light of magnesium > flares revealed naval patrol boats cruising just off the beach. Israeli security forces conducted negotiations with the militants. One hostage, Kochava Levy, became a mediator between the security forces and militants, as she spoke Arabic. During the negotiations, Levy provided the security forces detailed information on the militants. Early the next morning, the Israeli counter-terrorism unit Sayeret Matkal stormed the hotel, killing seven of the perpetrators and capturing the eighth. One Sayeret Matkal officer, Colonel Uzi Yairi, was also killed. Five hostages were freed, while five were killed. A few hours after the rescue operation, the boat that had transported the militants was captured on the high seas by the Israeli Navy. After the boat was detected by a reconnaissance aircraft, the Sa'ar 3-class missile boat INS Ga'ash and the Sa'ar 2-class missile boat INS Miznak moved to intercept it. They captured the boat about 70 miles off the coast of Hadera, and its crew was arrested. Two of the crew, who were Egyptian, were released, while the others were tried and convicted. One was sentenced to life imprisonment, while three others were given prison terms of 5–10 years. ==Perpetrators== Members of the Savoy cell included Musa Juma al-Tallka, the sole survivor, Muhammad Mashala, Hader Muhammad, Ziad Talk al-Zrir, Musa Awad, Muhammed al-Masri, Abu al-Lel, and Ahmed Hamid, who were all killed by the Israeli troops. Tallka was tried in a military court, convicted, and sentenced to death by hanging in March 1976. His death sentence was commuted. The bodies of those killed were released by the IDF in May 2012. ==Aftermath== Memorial plaque with the names of the victims in front of the Savoy Hotel The partially destroyed Savoy Hotel was completely demolished, and a new hotel of the same name was built in its place. The new Savoy Hotel opened in 1987. At its entrance is a memorial plaque with the names of the victims of the attack. In August 2012, it was reported that the Ramallah municipality approved the construction of a mausoleum to honor the eight Palestinians who were involved in the attack (the vote was initially reported by the PA daily newspaper Al- Hayat Al-Jadida and subsequently translated into English by Palestinian Media Watch). The decision to build the mausoleum coincides with the return of the perpetrators' remains, which were among the bodies of 91 Palestinian militants repatriated to the Palestinian Authority in June 2012 as an Israeli good-will gesture.Ramallah to honor remains of Savoy Hotel terrorists, Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), 14 August 2012. == References == ==External links== *Terrorist Suicide Operation Analysis Global Security Category:Mass murder in 1975 Category:Terrorist incidents in Asia in 1975 Category:Terrorist attacks attributed to Palestinian militant groups Category:Operations involving Israeli special forces Category:1970s murders in Israel Category:1975 crimes in Israel Category:1975 murders in Asia Category:Spree shootings in Israel Category:Terrorist incidents in Tel Aviv Category:Hostage taking in Israel Category:Attacks on hotels in Asia Category:Hotel bombings Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in Israel Category:Terrorist incidents in Israel in the 1970s Category:1970s in Tel Aviv ","title":"Savoy Hotel attack"},{"id":"2234260","text":"Caher is an Anglicised form of the Irish language word cathair (meaning \\"stone ringfort\\") and may refer to: Caher ==Historical== * Cathair, a general term for a stone ringfort in Ireland ==Places== Anglicised forms of many Irish place-names, such as * Caher Island an uninhabited island off the coast of County Mayo. * Cahir (sometimes spelled Caher) a town in South Tipperary in Ireland. * Several historic Electoral divisions in Ireland - including places named \\"Caher\\" in Clare, Cork, Kerry, Queen's County (Laois), and Tipperary: ** In County Clare, Scarriff SRD, several townlands named Caher in Ogonnelloe civil parish in Tulla Lower barony and in Feakle civil parish in Tulla Upper barony. ** In County Cork (East Riding section), SRD Youghal, a townland named Caher in Mogeely civil parish in Kinnatalloon barony. ** In County Cork (West Riding section), six townlands in six separate SRDs and DEDs. ** In County Kerry, three townlands in three separate SRDs and DEDs. ** In County Laois (Queens), two townlands, both in the civil parish of Offerlane in Upperwoods barony, Abbeyleix SRD, Caher DED. ** In County Tipperary (South Riding section), a civil parish (containing Caher Town) in Iffa and Offa West barony, Clogheen SRD, Caher DED. ==Geographical== * Caher Mountain (Kerry) (1,000 metres), the third highest peak in Ireland; part of the MacGillycuddy's Reeks range. * Caher Mountain (Cork) (338 metres), a hill near Kilcrohane in County Cork, Ireland ","title":"Caher"},{"id":"2234264","text":"Amadeus Flugdienst was a German airline.

He has held NWA Zero-One's United States Championship twice and Ultimate Pro Wrestling's first Heavyweight Champion. ==Early life== While attending North Carolina State University, he finished second in the 1992 NCAA Division I Heavyweight tournament, losing to future Olympic gold medalist Kurt Angle by points, 2-1, and later became champion in 1993. According to Angle's autobiography It's True, It's True, Terkay had 78 pins during his college career. ==Professional wrestling career== After training under Rick Bassman's Ultimate Pro Wrestling school in California, Terkay was signed to a WWE developmental contract, but later released. He joined Japanese pro wrestling promotion Pro Wrestling Zero1 in 2001 under the ring name The Predator, patterned after Bruiser Brody's character. ===World Wrestling Entertainment (2006–2007)=== Terkay (left) with Elijah Burke at December to Dismember After more training with WWE's Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) developmental territory, Terkay was brought up to the main roster of SmackDown! on July 28, 2006 working an MMA gimmick with Elijah Burke, who acted as his cornerman. Terkay defeated Matt Hardy in his debut match on SmackDown!. In the following weeks, Terkay dominated jobbers as well as later interfering in Burke's matches. On the October 20 episode of SmackDown!, Terkay helped Burke defeat Vito, breaking his 4-month undefeated streak. On the November 7, 2006 edition of WWE's ECW on Sci Fi, Terkay and his associate Elijah Burke debuted in ECW by doing a backstage promo. Their undefeated streak as a tag team was ended when The Hardys defeated them on ECW. At ECW's December To Dismember Terkay and Burke defeated The F.B.I. (Little Guido Maritato and Tony Mamaluke). In a backstage ECW promo Burke and Terkay dubbed themselves as the \\"Knock-out Tap-out Connection\\", a reference to Terkay's MMA and kickboxing background and Burke's amateur boxing background. He accompanied Burke to his matches in a bodyguard-type role for the next several weeks. Terkay remained undefeated in TV singles competition. On January 18, 2007, Terkay was released from his WWE contract. ===Japan (2010–2012)=== After leaving the WWE, Terkay returned to wrestling for the Japanese promotions of Inoki Genome Federation (IGF) and Pro Wrestling Zero1 and wrestled under his alter ego The Predator. On March 31, 2012 Terkay worked his last match which took place in Georgetown, Guyana for the WrestleRama event. ==Mixed martial arts career== During his time in Zero1, Terkay also fought in several mixed martial arts (MMA) matches for K-1. He made his debut by knocking his opponent Mauricio da Silva out in 13 seconds as part of the annual K-1 New Year's Eve spectacular, K-1 Dynamite. He returned at the Romanex event in 2004, facing Ultimate Fighting Championship and PRIDE Fighting Championships veteran Gary Goodridge. Despite Terkay's size advantage, experience played in Goodridge's favor and he finished Sylvester in 1:22. Also in 2004, however, Terkay defeated K-1 veteran Kristof Midoux, former trainer of Georges St-Pierre and Choi Mu-Bae, submitting him with a wrestling neck crank. This attracted a revenge match against Mu-Bae, which was won again by Terkay by unanimous decision in his last MMA venture. It was reported he had trouble getting fight contracts, as his lack of name value mixed with his good performances were seen as dangerous to established stars. ==Kickboxing career== In December 2005, Terkay made his kickboxing debut against Remy Bonjasky in K-1 Premium 2005, losing the match in a controversial unanimous decision. The normally polite Japanese audience booed heavily at this outcome, feeling Terkay was the true winner, and K-1 chairman Sadaharu Tanikawa agreed their opinion in the post-event press conference.Kamipro magazine, December 2005 Terkay had his second and last kickboxing fight at K-1 Las Vegas, facing fellow superheavyweight Choi Hong-man, who came similarly from losing to Remy Bonjasky. Hong-man scored an early knockdown, but Terkay come back soon and fought a back and forth first round. The second was not different, with the Korean taking another point by knockdown and making Terkay bleed, only for Terkay to rally back and almost drop the Korean down before the bell rang. At the third, Terkay controlled an exhausted Choi, harassing him with combinations against the ropes until the end of the match. The decision was given to Choi due to the points scored.K-1 VEGAS REVIEW AND RESULTSSchilt, Karaev and Choi Victorious in K-1 As in the previous match, the audience booed the decision, again feeling that Terkay was the victor and that the score system did not do justice to the match. ==Other media== Terkay has appeared in multiple films and TV shows over the years. He appeared in the 2001 movie Slammed along with former wrestling personality Zeus. He appeared on an episode of In the House as a Santa Imposter, and also appeared on the game show Distraction and bodyslammed contestants while they tried to answer questions. He made an appearance in the 2006 movie Evil Bong as a nightclub bouncer. He appeared in the 2010 movie True Legend as a fighter named Elder Scot Brother. He also appeared in the movie/documentary \\"101 Reasons Not To Be A Pro Wrestler\\", where he talked about his views on the wrestling business. In the 2014 film Pro Wrestlers vs Zombies, Terkay makes a cameo appearance as a zombie wrestler who fights Kurt Angle. ==Filmography== Film { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" align=\\"center\\" ! colspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"background: LightSteelBlue;\\"  Film - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" align=\\"center\\" !

This can be at macro-levels as in economics and at micro-levels within individual organizations. For example, at macro-levels, a government may influence interest rates to regulate financial demand. At the micro-level, a cellular service provider may provide free night and weekend use to reduce demand during peak hours. Demand management has a defined set of processes, capabilities and recommended behaviors for companies that produce goods and services. Consumer electronics and goods companies often lead in the application of demand management practices to their demand chains; demand management outcomes are a reflection of policies and programs to influence demand as well as competition and options available to users and consumers. Effective demand management follows the concept of a \\"closed loop\\" where feedback from the results of the demand plans is fed back into the planning process to improve the predictability of outcomes. Many practices reflect elements of systems dynamics. Volatility is being recognized as significant an issue as the focus on variance of demand to plans and forecasts. ==In economicsMacroeconomics=== In macroeconomics, demand management it is the art or science of controlling aggregate demand to avoid a recession. Demand management at the macroeconomic level involves the use of discretionary policy and is inspired by Keynesian economics, though today elements of it are part of the economic mainstream. The underlying idea is for the government to use tools like interest rates, taxation, and public expenditure to change key economic decisions like consumption, investment, the balance of trade, and public sector borrowing resulting in an 'evening out' of the business cycle. Demand management was widely adopted in the 1950s to 1970s, and was for a time successful. It did not prevent the stagflation of the 1970s, which is considered to have been precipitated by the supply shock caused by the 1973 oil crisis. Theoretical criticisms of demand management are that it relies on a long-run Phillips Curve for which there is no evidence, and that it produces dynamic inconsistency and can therefore be non-credible. Today, most governments relatively limit interventions in demand management to tackling short-term crises, and rely on policies like independent central banks and fiscal policy rules to prevent long-run economic disruption. ===Natural resources and environment=== In natural resources management and environmental policy more generally, demand management refers to policies to control consumer demand for environmentally sensitive or harmful goods such as water and energy. Within manufacturing firms the term is used to describe the activities of demand forecasting, planning, and order fulfillment. In the environmental context demand management is increasingly taken seriously to reduce the economy's throughput of scarce resources for which market pricing does not reflect true costs. Examples include metering of municipal water, and carbon taxes on gasoline. ===Welfare economics=== Demand management in economics focuses on the optimal allocation resources to affect social welfare. Welfare economics uses the perspective and techniques of microeconomics, but they can be aggregated to make macroeconomic conclusions. Because different \\"optimal\\" states may exist in an economy in terms of the allocation of resources, welfare economics seeks the state that will create the highest overall level of social welfare. Some people object to the idea of wealth redistribution because it flies in the face of pure capitalist ideals, but economists suggest that greater states of overall social good might be achieved by redistributing incomes in the economy.\\"Welfare Economics\\", Investopedia Because welfare economics follows the techniques of microeconomics, where demand planning is part of the process especially the redistribution of the funds through government taxes, fees and royalties to programs for societal good, such as roads, services, income support and agriculture support programs. ==Demand management as a business process== Demand management is both a stand-alone process and one that is integrated into sales and operations planning (S&OP;) or integrated business planning (IBP). Demand management in its most effective form has a broad definition well beyond just developing a \\"forecast\\" based on history supplemented by \\"market\\" or customer intelligence, and often left to the supply chain organization to interpret. Philip Kotler notes two key points: 1. Demand management is the responsibility of the marketing organization (in his definition sales is subset of marketing); 2. The demand \\"forecast\\" is the result of planned marketing efforts. Those planned efforts, not only should focus on stimulating demand, more importantly influencing demand so that a business's objectives are achieved. The components of effective demand management, identified by George Palmatier and Colleen Crum, are: 1. planning demand; 2. communicating demand; 3. influencing demand and 4. prioritizing demand. === Demand control === Demand control is a principle of the overarching demand management process found in most manufacturing businesses. Demand control focuses on alignment of supply and demand when there is a sudden, unexpected shift in the demand plan. The shifts can occur when near- term demand becomes greater than supply, or when actual orders are less than the established demand plan. The result can lead to reactive decisions, which can have a negative impact of workloads, costs, and customer satisfaction. Demand control creates synchronization across the sales, demand planning, and supply planning functions. Unlike typical monthly demand or supply planning reviews, demand control reviews occur at more frequent intervals (daily or weekly), which allows the organization to respond quickly and proactively to possible demand or supply imbalances.  Time fences  thumb The demand control process requires that all functions agree on time fences within the planning horizon, which should be no less than a rolling 24 months based on integrated business planning best practices. A time fence is a decision point within a manufacturer's planning horizon. Typically, three established time fences exist within a company: * Future planning zone - Supply is managed to match demand * Trading zone - Demand is managed to match supply for production * Firm zone - Demand is managed to match supply for procurement  Demand controller  A demand controller is established when a company implements a demand control process. Unlike a demand planner who focuses on long-term order management, the demand controller is responsible for short-term order management, focusing specifically when demand exceeds supply or demand appears to be less than planned, and engages sales management in both situations. The demand controller works across multiple functions involved in the supply and demand processes, including demand planning, supply planning, sales, and marketing. ==Elements== Planning demand involves a full multiple-view process or work flow; including statistical forecast as a baseline from clean \\"demand history\\" [not shipments], using the most effective statistical models. Kai Trepte developed the Microsoft Excel add-in \\"Forecast X\\" to provide practitioners with a workstation capability to assess the best matches between data and forecast models. Increasingly \\"predictive forecasts\\" have moved from a limited use to becoming best practice for more companies. Predictive forecasts use simulation of potential future outcomes and their probabilities rather than history to form the basis for long range (5-10+ years) demand plans. Baseline forecasts are typically developed by demand planners and analysts, who may be regional or centrally located. They work under the guidance of the demand manager. Baseline forecasts are communicated to members of the demand management team. This usually includes regional sales leaders, market managers, and product managers. The team may include customer service leads who manager orders under service agreements with customers and have direct insight into customer demand. For major retailers this is often point of sale data provided to suppliers. ==Information technology== Information technology and information system demand managers seek to understand in advance how to best meet the needs and expectations of customers, clients, partners, and enablers. Thus, proper forecast and sizing of demand is required in order to deliver a stable and effective technology environment. == Demand management as part of project portfolio management == Romano, Grimaldi, and Colasuonno consider demand management as a harvesting activity, governed by a strategy that gives portfolios direction and a selection model intended to select the best beneficial set of activities aligned with strategic objectives. They suggest component-oriented demand management be approached proactively, with a strategy driven by business objectives, and responsibility of top management representing the chosen strategic direction. ==See also== *Customer demand planning *Demand chain *Demand modeling *Forecasting *Functional finance *Inventory control *Supply and demand *Workforce modeling ==References== ==External links== * Demand Management for IT Category:Economic planning Category:Demand Category:Supply chain management ","title":"Demand management"},{"id":"2234279","text":"Casual Viewin' is a 2000 album by Canadian alternative rock band 54-40.

In translation theory, another term for \\"literal translation\\" is \\"metaphrase\\" and for phrasal (\\"sense\\") translation — \\"paraphrase.\\" Literal translation leads to mistranslating of idioms, which is a serious problem for machine translation.John Hutchins, \\"The whisky was invisible\\", or Persistent myths of MT, MT News International 11 (June 1995), pp. 17-18. == The term as used in translation studies Usage=== The term \\"literal translation\\" often appeared in the titles of 19th-century English translations of classical, Bible and other texts. ===Cribs=== Word-for-word translations (\\"cribs,\\" \\"ponies\\", or \\"trots\\") are sometimes prepared for a writer who is translating a work written in a language he does not know. For example, Robert Pinsky is reported to have used a literal translation in preparing his translation of Dante's Inferno (1994), as he does not know Italian. Similarly, Richard Pevear worked from literal translations provided by his wife, Larissa Volokhonsky, in their translations of several Russian novels. ===Poetry to prose=== Literal translation can also denote a translation that represents the precise meaning of the original text but does not attempt to convey its style, beauty, or poetry. There is, however, a great deal of difference between a literal translation of a poetic work and a prose translation. A literal translation of poetry may be in prose rather than verse, but also be error free. Charles Singleton's translation of The Divine Comedy (1975) is regarded as a prose translation. == As bad practice == \\"Literal\\" translation implies that it is probably full of errors, since the translator has made no effort to convey, for example, correct idioms or shades of meaning, but it might be also useful in seeing how words are used to convey meaning in the source language. ===Examples=== A literal English translation of the German word \\"Kindergarten\\" would be \\"children's garden,\\" but in English, the expression refers to the school year between pre-school and first grade. Literal translations in which individual components within words or compounds are translated to create new lexical items in the target language (a process also known as “loan translation”) are called calques, e.g., “beer garden” from German “Biergarten.” The literal translation of the Italian sentence, \\"So che questo non va bene\\" (\\"I know that this is not good\\"), produces \\"Know(I) that this not goes(it) well,\\" which has English words and Italian grammar. ===Machine translation=== Early machine translations (as of 1962 at least) were notorious for this type of translation as they simply employed a database of words and their translations. Later attempts utilized common phrases which resulted in better grammatical structure and capture of idioms but with many words left in the original language. For translating synthetic languages, a morphosyntactic analyzer and synthesizer is required. The best systems today use a combination of the above technologies and apply algorithms to correct the \\"natural\\" sound of the translation. In the end though, professional translation firms that employ machine translation use it as a tool to create a rough translation that is then tweaked by a human, professional translator. ===Pidgins=== Often, first-generation immigrants create something of a literal translation in how they speak their parents' native language. This results in a mix of the two languages in something of a pidgin. Many such mixes have specific names, e.g. Spanglish or Germish. For example, American children of German immigrants are heard using \\"rockingstool\\" from the German word \\"Schaukelstuhl\\" instead of \\"rocking chair\\". ==Translator's humor== Literal translation of idioms is a source of numerous translators' jokes and apocrypha. The following joke has often been told both in the context of newbie translators and that of machine translation: When the sentence \\"The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak\\" (дух бодр, плоть же немощна, an allusion to Mark 14:38) was translated into Russian and then back to English, the result was \\"The vodka is good, but the meat is rotten\\" (водка хорошая, но мясо протухло). This is generally believed to be simply an amusing story, and not a factual reference to an actual machine translation error. == See also == *All your base are belong to us *Calque *Dynamic and formal equivalence *Literal Standard Version *Metaphrase *Translation *Young's Literal Translation (of the Bible) == References == ==Further reading== *Olive Classe, Encyclopedia of literary translation into English, vol. 1, Taylor & Francis, 2000, , p. viii.

His children were Eleanor (1896–1992) (later Lady Castle Stewart after her marriage to Arthur Stuart, 7th Earl Castle Stewart), Gertrude (1898–1966) and Barbara Guggenheim (1904–1985). He began collecting works of the old masters in the 1890s. He retired from his business in 1919 to devote more time to art collecting and in 1926, met Baroness Hilla von Rebay. In 1930, they visited Wassily Kandinsky’s studio in Dessau, Germany, and Guggenheim began to purchase Kandinsky's work. The same year, Guggenheim began to display the collection to the public at his apartment in the Plaza Hotel in New York City. Guggenheim's purchases continued with the works of Rudolf Bauer, Marc Chagall, Fernand Léger and László Moholy-Nagy. ===Foundation and museum=== In 1937, Guggenheim established the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation to foster the appreciation of modern art, and in 1939, he and his art advisor, Baroness Rebay, opened a venue for the display of his collection, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, at 24 East 54th Street.Vail, pp. 25 and 36 Under Rebay's guidance, Guggenheim sought to include in the collection the most important examples of non-objective art available at the time, such as Kandinsky's Composition 8 (1923), Léger's Contrast of Forms (1913) and Robert Delaunay's Simultaneous Windows (2nd Motif, 1st Part) (1912).Calnek, Anthony, et al. The Guggenheim Collection, pp. 39–40, New York: The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, 2006 By the early 1940s, the museum had accumulated such a large collection of avant-garde paintings that the need for a permanent building to house the art collection had become apparent.Winter, Damon. \\"Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum\\", The New York Times, October 21, 2009, accessed March 7, 2012 In 1943, Guggenheim and Rebay commissioned architect Frank Lloyd Wright to design a new museum building.Vail, p. 333 In 1948, the collection was greatly expanded through the purchase of art dealer Karl Nierendorf's estate of some 730 objects, notably German expressionist paintings. By that time, the museum's collection included a broad spectrum of expressionist and surrealist works, including paintings by Paul Klee, Oskar Kokoschka and Joan Miró. Guggenheim died in 1949 on Long Island, New York, and the museum was renamed the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 1952. The museum opened in New York City on October 21, 1959. ==Legacy== In addition to the New York Museum, the Guggenheim Foundation operates, among other things, the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain and the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, which was established by Guggenheim's niece, Peggy Guggenheim. ==See also== * Guggenheim family ==Notes== ==References== * * ==External links== * * Category:1861 births Category:1949 deaths Category:American people of Swiss-Jewish descent Category:American philanthropists Solomon R.

They were led by the new Governor, Daniel de Rémy de Courcelles, and Lieutenant General Alexandre de Prouville, Sieur de Tracy. Approximately 1,200 men (Piedmont, Savoyard and Ligurian) arrived in New France the middle of 1665. ==Formation== The Carignan-Salières was formed from two existing regiments: the Balthasar Regiment, formed during the Thirty Years' War and becoming the Salières when Balthasar died in 1665, and the Carignan Regiment, formed in 1644 in Piedmont. Following the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, both regiments avoided disbandment by merging to form the Carignan-Salières Regiment. ==Crisis In New France== New France was initially a proprietary colony granted by the French Crown to various corporations to rule provided they fulfilled various terms of their charters like supporting the missionary work of the Roman Catholic Church amongst the Indians. After the successive bankruptcies of the various corporations which had previously received royal charters, in 1627, trading in New France was granted by the Crown to the Compagnie des Cent-Associés (\\"Company of 100 Associates\\"), who gained exclusive rights to rule New France, provided they fulfilled the terms of the royal charter. In 1649, the Iroquois began the Beaver Wars to take control of the fur trade by eliminating other middlemen, which also embroiled them in conflict with the French.Richter, Daniel \\"War and Culture: The Iroquois Experience\\" pages 528-559 from The William and Mary Quarterly, Volume 40, No. 4, October 1983 page 540. In 1649, the Iroquois destroyed the enervatedSympatico \\"1634-1649 - Smallpox and the End of the Hurons\\"; A Brief History of Canada 1600 to 1699 Settlement, Fur Trade & War. Wendat (Huron) nation, whose homeland, Wendake, lies in what is now southern Ontario, bordered on three sides by Lake Ontario, Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay; it was through Wendake that the Ojibwa and Cree, who lived further north, traded with the French.Verney, Jack The Good Regiment\\", Montreal: McGill Press, 1992, page 19. The destruction of the Wendat nation destabilized the fur trade for the French, and the Odawa quickly took their place as the middlemen, bringing furs from the northern lands to Montreal, as did coureurs de bois. The Compagnie des Cent-Associés barely hung on against the Iroquois onslaught, with Iroquois war parties intercepting canoes carrying furs to Montreal, cutting off French forts, raiding French settlements along the banks of the St. Lawrence river to carry off captives, and sometimes laying out iron chains they had obtained from the Dutch to blockade the St. Lawrence to prevent ships from using the river. By 1660, the total population of New France was 3, 035 with about 1, 928 being French.Verney, Jack The Good Regiment\\", Montreal: McGill Press, 1992 page 4. There were about 900 people living in Quebec City and about 200 each in Montreal and Trois-Rivères, and the rest spread out in small settlements along the St. Lawrence. The white population of New France was 63% male and most were engaged in someway in the fur trade. The Compagnie des Cent-Associés fulfilled the terms of its royal charter to bring settlers to New France, but most were indentured laborers who left New France at the end of their five- year contracts. The harsh winters, the shortage of women, and the threat of being carried off by the Iroquois led to very few Frenchmen wanting to stay, and unable to build the population, the Compagnie des Cent-Associés simply lacked the manpower to counter the Iroquois. Throughout the struggle, the authorities in New France sent desperate appeals for help to Paris, only to be informed France was fully engaged in a war with Spain that did not end until 1659 and there were no soldiers to spare to send to New France. Additionally, France was caught in a series of civil wars known as the Fronde in the 1650s, and with Frenchmen busy killing each other, it was inconceivable to send a force across the Atlantic. But even after the Peace of the Pyrenees ended the war with Spain in 1659, the Crown remained indifferent to New France. In 1661, Pierre Boucher, the governor of Trois-Rivères, visited Paris to beg for help, saying that people in Trois-Rivères were afraid to go outside without a weapon lest they be carried off by the Iroquois, only to be politely told that the responsibility of the defense of New France rested with the Compagnie des Cent-Associés, not the Crown. Unable to turn a profit with the \\"Beaver Wars\\" raging, the Compagnie des Cent-Associés went bankrupt in 1663 and New France became a Crown colony ruled directly by the French state. The immediate concern of King Louis XIV was to make the new Crown colony turn a profit, which would require ending the Iroquois threat. In 1664, following the request of the Sovereign Council, the French finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert ordered the Carignan-Salières to reinforce the existing 100 man force in New France. This reinforcement was as much, if not more, motivated by mercantile ambitions than actual cries for help from New France. In a letter to Bishop François Laval written on 18 March 1664, Colbert promised him: \\"His Majesty has resolved to send a good regiment of infantry at the end of the year, or in the month of February next, in order to destroy these barbarians [the Iroquois] completely\\".Verney, Jack The Good Regiment\\", Montreal: McGill Press, 1992 page 3. Louis XIV had ambitious foreign policy plans for Europe, most notably pushing France to its \\"natural frontiers\\", and Colbert had promoted a mercantile economic policy to pay for the projected wars in Europe.Verney, Jack The Good Regiment\\", Montreal: McGill Press, 1992 page 5. Colbert had hopes that if New France was properly developed, it could play the same role for France that Peru and Mexico did for Spain, providing a source of wealth that would pay for the wars to come. Louis, Colbert and other French leaders were envious of the way that the gold and silver of the New World had allowed Spain to afford a powerful military, and very much wanted New France to play the same role for them. By now the regiment had been reduced to eight companies of about 400 troops; this was insufficient to meet King Louis XIV's demand for a large military force. The regiment's strength was increased to 20 companies and 1000 troops by absorbing 12 other French companies, including those from the Lallier, Chambellé, Poitou, and Broglio regiments. A popular erroneous story in New France was that the regiment had fought in the Austro- Turkish War of 1663–64; the story may have arisen from troops of the 12 new companies, many of whom may have fought in that war. Four companies under Alexandre de Prouville joined the Carignan-Salières in New France from Martinique; de Prouville companies were attached to, but never formally integrated into, the Carignan-Salières. ==Leadership== The following were members of the leadership hierarchy in New France during the regiment's stay: *Lieutenant General in command of French America: Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy *Governor of New France: Daniel de Rémy de Courcelles *Intendent: Jean Talon *Commanding Officer: Henri de Chastelard de Salières (in charge of seven companies) *Surgeon Major: Vincent Basset du Tartre ==Arrival in New France== The following is a list of ships that carried the Carignan-Salières Regiment from France to New France in 1665. { class= ! colspan=2  Ship !

The first, Le Vieux Siméon, departed La Rochelle 19 April 1665, arriving at Quebec 1 July 1665. On board were the companies of La Fouille, Froment, Chambly and Rougment. The arrival of the first companies of the regiment at one stroke increased the population of Quebec City by 25%, and an immediate problem was building housing for the newly arrived soldiers who at first had to camp out in tents outside Quebec City. The Le Vieux Siméon was a Dutch ship chartered by a La Rochelle merchant, Pierre Gaigneur, who was well-experienced sailing between France and its colonies. The next two ships to depart from France were La Paix and L’Aigle d’Or. The former carried the companies of La Colonelle, celles de Contrecoeur, Maximy, and Sorel, and on board the latter were de Salières, La Fredière, Grandfontaine and La Motte. These both were royal ships of the king's navy that departed from La Rochelle 13 May 1665, arriving at Quebec 18 August 1665. The following two ships were also royal vessels: Le Saint Sébastian and Le Justice. Aboard Le Saint Sébastian, amongst these next seven companies being transported to New France, were the newly appointed Intendant of New France, Jean Talon, and the Governor Daniel de Rémy de Courcelles. Aboard the final two ships were the companies of Du Prat, Naurois, Laubia, Saint-Ours, Petit, La Varenne, Vernon. These last two ships to depart from France left La Rochelle 24 May 1665, arriving at Quebec 12 September 1665. Four companies arrived with Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy on the Brézé from the Antilles, arriving in New France 30 June 1665. The captains of these companies were La Durantaye (Chambellé), Berthier (L'Allier), La Brisardière (Orléans), Monteil (Poitou). Tracy had been in the West Indies as part of his royal commission to officially establish Louis XIV's rule of the French colonies, following the King's takeover of the French territories after the bankruptcy of the Company of 100 Associates. The last ship to sail from France associated with the regiment was the Jardin de Hollande which carried the provisions and equipment for the troops. Depending on sources, there are some contradictions as to when ships arrived in New France and what companies were on board said ships. ==Reception in New France== They were welcomed as saviours, particularly by Mother Marie of the Incarnation, head of the local convent, who wrote of their arrival: Although Mother Marie viewed them as saviors, modern day scholars like Jack Verney argue that their mission, contrary to what she states, was \\"a secular rather than sacred one\\".Jean-Baptiste Colbert wanted to develop the colony's economic potential. After requiring that the Company of One Hundred Associates (Compagnie de la Nouvelle-France) relinquish its monopoly on trade in 1663, Louis XIV and his minister finally had the control they needed to develop the colony's economic potential.Edits, ordonnaces royaux, I: 21-4 In Montreal, the Sulpician priest, François Dollier de Casson, reacted to the soldiers negatively, saying that \\"vices which have, in fact, risen and grown here since that time [when the troops arrived], along with many other troubles and misfortunes which had not up to that time made their appearance here\\". In Verney's view, this is a much more realistic account of how the men had \\"marked their progress along the road to La Rochelle with outbreaks of disorder and indiscipline\\". ==Fort building== The regiment's service in New France began when a third of them were ordered to build new forts along the Richelieu River, the principal route of the Iroquois marauders. Fort Chambly formerly known as Fort St. Louis at Chambly, Fort Sainte Thérèse, and Fort Saint-Jean at Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, were along the Richelieu River and were constructed as ways to limit Iroquois nation attacks on citizens of New France. Fort Sainte Anne in Lake Champlain was near the river's source. All of the forts were used as supply stations for the troops as they were deployed on their two campaigns into Iroquois nation land in 1666. Fort Chambly as constructed in 1665 was the first wooden fort constructed in New France and had a rudimentary wood wall system with a building in the center of the fort. Inside, and near the center building, were small buildings for the troops. ==Campaigns First campaign === The first of the regiment's campaign took place in the winter of 1666. The expedition was initiated by the governor, Daniel de Rémy de Courcelles. General Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy agreed to the campaign after the Mohawks refused to attend a delegation of the Iroquois nations and French leaders in Montreal in November 1665. At this delegation the French entered into agreements with the Oneida and Onondaga nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, who were there to represent themselves as well as the Cayugas and the Senecas. Tracy interpreted the Mohawk absence as signalling a threatening lack of intimidation by the presence of the Carignan- Salières soldiers. The Marquis de Salières, recognized that the winter campaign would not succeed without basic necessities such as proper clothing, shoes and cooking equipment. Marquis de Salières thought that this endeavour was impossible, stating in his memoirs that: The men left 30 January 1666 under the orders of Courcelles, despite the fact that their Native guides had not yet arrived. Indeed, this campaign also differed greatly from the European tradition of not campaigning in winter. The campaign was made up of about five hundred men of regimental soldiers, a number of Indians, and an estimated 200 volunteer habitants. The column ended up getting lost, wandering in the wilderness for three weeks before ending up on the outskirts of the Anglo- Dutch settlement of Schenectady. The soldiers came across a village that they assumed was Mohawk and launched a brutal attack, ravaging the village and killing two and severely wounding another two. The sounds of the battle were overheard by a passing Mohawk party of composed of approximately sixty warriors. The French and Mohawks engaged in a small skirmish which resulted in a small number of casualties on both sides. The French troops were at a tactical disadvantage as they were used to the pitched battles regulated by rigid drills commonly used in Continental Europe. Despite the experience of the soldiers of the Carignan-Salières Regiment, their tactics were useless against the hit-and-run tactics used by the Mohawks. The fighting ended when the burgomaster of Schenectady informed Courcelles that he was in the territory of the Duke of York. The burgomaster implied that if the French chose to stay in the settlement they would be vulnerable to attacks by both Indians and the English units stationed at Schenectady and Albany (less than 25 kilometres away). The French stopped the attack and the burgomaster agreed to provide the men with some provisions for their return journey. The campaign was ultimately a failure. Nothing was accomplished and the regiment sustained great losses; 400 out of 500 died. Due to the hastiness with which the campaign had been launched and the harshness of the weather, most of the deaths occurred while travelling from and to Fort St. Louis. When Courcelles commanded that the troops were to meet at Fort St. Louis at the end of January, he said that they should be prepared with three weeks worth of provisions. In total, the expedition took a little over five weeks to complete. What is more, the men were ill-equipped—many left the fort without snowshoes—which contributed significantly to the campaign's death toll. === Second campaign === The regiment's second and final campaign was led by Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy. The plan was to enter into Mohawk territory, located northwest of Schenectady along what is now the Mohawk River. The necessity of the campaign was created by the declaration of the Second Anglo- Dutch War in the summer of 1666. King Louis XIV wanted de Tracy to lead the men into the same area where they were the last year near Albany and Schenectady. However, it was first necessary for the French to subdue the Mohawks to protect themselves from facing multiple fronts against both the English and Mohawks. In addition, they wanted to ensure that their two opponents would not ally themselves against the French. The destruction of four Mohawk villages was the most important outcome of the venture. However, there was no real fighting as the villages the regiment came across had been abandoned prior to the arrival of the regiment. The plan was for the regiment to regroup at Fort Sainte Anne on the 28 and push into Mohawk territory on 29 September 1666. The Late arriving of several parties meant the regiment left in three separate columns over a period of three days. The number of men available in the campaign was approximately 120 regimental soldiers, habitants and Native warriors. Because de Tracy sought to use the element of surprise and swiftly move into enemy territory, he ordered his soldiers to travel light. Thus, from the beginning of the campaign, the Regiment's situation was precarious as the soldiers brought insufficient provisions and did not carry the necessary equipment for a lengthy assault. Inclement weather added to the danger of the mission and further threatened the campaign's success. As it moved inland, the regiment encountered four Mohawk villages all of which had been abandoned. The fact that the Mohawks abandoned their villages was fortuitous for the regiment since it was not operating at full strength and the soldiers were stretched over a large area. At this point in the campaign, the regiment probably would not have been able to withstand a large-scale attack. What is more, the villages were hastily abandoned thus providing the French troops with a supply of food, tools, weapons, and other provisions. After regrouping at the last of the four villages, Tracy ordered the soldiers to turn around and burn each one as they went, carrying all the loot they could back to Quebec. The Mohawks, though skilled in guerilla fighting, were caught by surprise by the speed of the French attack and were unable to engage the French. On 17 October 1666, the lands and fields surrounding the Mohawk villages were all claimed as French territory and crosses were erected to symbolize that claim. However, the French never returned to the area to enforce this territorial claim. Despite the fact that the French troops had not directly engaged the Mohawks or the English, the campaign was considered a great success; the French finally assumed a position of tactical superiority over the Mohawk and Iroquois Confederacy which in turn gave the French a diplomatic advantage in the following peace talks. In July 1667, peace was signed with the Iroquois following a five-day summit. The main objective of the French during the negotiations was to consolidate their control of the fur trade at the expense of the Anglo-Dutch interests in Albany. They sought to do so by placing themselves in a position that allowed them to oversee the traffic of the fur trade in the region. As a result, the French were able to place French-speaking traders as well as Jesuits in a number of Iroquois village. To ensure the success of this agreement as well as the security of the traders and missionaries, a system of hostages was implemented. Each Iroquois village was required to send two members of a leading family to live among in the St. Lawrence Valley. Following the ratification of the treaties of 1667, the peace was kept in the region for twenty years. The peace treaties of 1667 also signaled the end of the regiment's operations in New France. Nonetheless, the troops of the Carignan-Salières Regiment were held in duty until another means of protecting New France could be devised. == Troop life  Religion === Even though the Edict of Nantes in 1598 had allowed French Protestants to live in France, the law was not always observed in the colonies. The king had given huge power to the Jesuit order by making it part of New France's government. So, when Mgr de Laval discovered the significant numbers of unconfirmed Catholics and even some French Protestants within the ranks of the regiment, drastic measures were taken. Jesuit Father Claude Dablon gave two emergency sermons within five days of the first eight companies landing in New France to reaffirm the relapsed and unconfirmed Catholics in the regiment. === Equipment === The first regulars of the Carignan-Salières were dressed for \\"efficiency rather than looks\\". Additionally, the soldiers were rather poorly equipped during their first year. In the duration of one year, the king had sent only 200 flintlocks as well as 100 pistols for a troop force of over 1,200 men. Below are descriptions of some of the equipment used: *Powder horn: used to store gunpowder for firing their weapons. *Black powder: used to arm and fire the newly issued muskets of the regiment. *Sword: used commonly for hand-to-hand fighting and every soldier had one. *Flintlock musket: became the main weapon of long range fighting for the Carignan-Salières. It replaced the matchlock musket that was common in early years due to its increased reliability and ability to be fired without the use of an external flame. Additionally, it was capable of a much higher rate of fire than the earlier matchlock. *Bayonet: the Carignan-Salières were one of the first regiments to transition to the bayonet, which was introduced in 1647. *Pistol: a standard issue weapon but was not in high-supplies in New France. *Slouch hat: was worn in place of later tricorn hats. It was better at repelling rain and wind from the faces of soldiers. *Uniform: The Carignan-Salières wore brown coats with contrasting colour sleeves. The Carignan-Salières were one of the first French forces to wear uniforms. ==Departure and settlement in Canada== With the end to the Iroquois threat, King Louis XIV decided to offer the men of the regiment an opportunity to stay in New France to help increase the population. As incentive, regular officers were offered 100 livres or 50 livres and a year worth of rations. Lieutenants, alternatively, were offered 150 livres or 100 livres and a year worth of rations. Officers were also offered the incentive of large land grants in the forms of seigneuries. This offer was particularly beneficial to such men as Pierre de Saurel, Alexandre Berthier, Antoine Pécaudy de Contrecœur, and François Jarret de Verchères, who were granted large seigneuries in New France. Although the majority of the regiment returned to France in 1668, about 450 remained behind to settle in Canada. These men were highly encouraged to marry, being offered land as incentive. As a result, most of them did marry newly arriving women to the colony known as Filles du Roi. The largest import of women to New France occurred during the 1660s and early 1670s, largely in response to the need to provide wives for the regiment. Besides just rewarding Carignan-Salières officers by granting them seigneurial tenures, the tenure properties served an ulterior purpose. The properties granted to Contrecœur and Saurel were placed in strategic areas that could be used as a buffer between invaders both foreign (the British) as well as domestic (the Iroquois). It was believed that the men of the Carignan- Salières would be the colonists best suited to defend the territories of New France, therefore many of them were given properties on the Richelieu river and other areas prone to attack. These Seigneurs would sub grant land to the men of their companies in order to create an even more thoroughly reinforced zone. Saurel's land would later be known as Sorel-Tracy in Quebec, while Contrecœur's property would later become a region named after himself. The French had a practice of allotting noms de guerre – nicknames – to their soldiers (this is still continued, but for different reasons, in the Foreign Legion). Many of these nicknames remain today as they gradually became the official surnames of the many soldiers who elected to remain in Canada when their service expired as well as the names of cities and towns throughout New France. ==Names after departure from Canada== *1677: Renamed Régiment de Soissons *1690: Renamed Régiment de Perche *1744: Renamed Gardes de Lorraine *1766: Renamed Régiment de Lorraine *1791: 47e Régiment de Infanterie *1793: 47e demi-brigade de bataille ==References== ==External links== *Regimental Lineage Chart by John P.

Digital data comes in these three states: data at rest, data in transit and data in use. ==Characteristics== To translate data to information, there must be several known factors considered. The factors involved are determined by the creator of the data and the desired information. Metadata is data about the data. Metadata may be implied, specified or given. Data relating to physical events or processes will also have a temporal component. In almost all cases this temporal component is implied. This is the case when a device such as a temperature logger receives data from a temperature sensor. When the temperature is received it is assumed that the data has a temporal reference of now. So the device records the date, time and temperature together. When the data logger communicates temperatures, it must also report the date and time (metadata) for each temperature reading. At its most essential, a single datum is a value stored at a specific location. Fundamentally, computers follow a sequence of instructions they are given in the form of data. A set of instructions to perform a given task (or tasks) is called a \\"program\\". In the nominal case, the program, as executed by the computer, will consist of binary machine code. The elements of storage manipulated by the program, but not actually executed by the CPU, are also data. Program instructions, and the data that the program manipulates, are both stored in exactly the same way. Therefore, it is possible for computer programs to operate on other computer programs, by manipulating their programmatic data. The line between program and data can become blurry. An interpreter, for example, is a program. The input data to an interpreter is itself a program, just not one expressed in native machine language. In many cases, the interpreted program will be a human-readable text file, which is manipulated with a text editor program (more normally associated with plain text data). Metaprogramming similarly involves programs manipulating other programs as data. Programs like compilers, linkers, debuggers, program updaters, virus scanners and such use other programs as their data. To store data bytes in a file, they have to be serialized in a \\"file format\\". Typically, programs are stored in special file types, different from those used for other data. Executable files contain programs; all other files are also data files. However, executable files may also contain \\"in-line\\" data which is built into the program. In particular, some executable files have a data segment, which nominally contains constants and initial values (both data). For example: a user might first instruct the operating system to load a word processor program from one file, and then edit a document stored in another file with the word processor program. In this example, the document would be considered data. If the word processor also features a spell checker, then the dictionary (word list) for the spell checker would also be considered data. The algorithms used by the spell checker to suggest corrections would be either machine code data or text in some interpretable programming language. ==Data keys and values, structures and persistence== Keys in data provide the context for values. Regardless of the structure of data, there is always a key component present. Data keys in data and data-structures are essential for giving meaning to data values. Without a key that is directly or indirectly associated with a value, or collection of values in a structure, the values become meaningless and cease to be data. That is to say, there has to be at least a key component linked to a value component in order for it to be considered data. Data can be represented in computers in multiple ways, as per the following examples: ===RAM=== * Random Access Memory holds data that the computer processor(s) has direct access to. A computer processor (CPU) may only manipulate data within itself (Processor register) or memory. This is as opposed to data storage, where the processor(s) must move data between the storage device (disk, tape...) and memory. RAM is an array of one (1) or more block(s) of linear contiguous locations that a processor may read or write by providing an address for the read or write operation. The \\"random\\" part of RAM means that the processor may operate on any location in memory at any time in any order. (Also see Memory management unit). In RAM the smallest element of data is the \\"Binary Bit\\". The capabilities and limitations of accessing RAM are processor specific. In general main memory or RAM is arranged as an array of \\"sets of electronic on/off switches\\" or locations beginning at address 0 (hexadecimal 0). Each location can store usually 8, 16, 32 or 64 parallel bits depending on the processor (CPU) architecture. Therefore, any value stored in a byte in RAM has a matching location expressed as an offset from the first memory location in the memory array i.e. 0+n, where n is the offset into the array of memory locations. ===Keys=== * Data keys need not be a direct hardware address in memory. Indirect, abstract and logical keys codes can be stored in association with values to form a data structure. Data structures have predetermined offsets (or links or paths) from the start of the structure, in which data values are stored. Therefore, the data key consists of the key to the structure plus the offset (or links or paths) into the structure. When such a structure is repeated, storing variations of [the data values and the data keys] within the same repeating structure, the result can be considered to resemble a table, in which each element of the repeating structure is considered to be a column and each repetition of the structure is considered as a row of the table. In such an organization of data, the data key is usually a value in one (or a composite of the values in several of) the columns. ===Organised recurring data structures=== * The tabular view of repeating data structures is only one of many possibilities. Repeating data structures can be organised hierarchically, such that nodes are linked to each other in a cascade of parent-child relationships. Values and potentially more complex data-structures are linked to the nodes. Thus the nodal hierarchy provides the key for addressing the data structures associated with the nodes. This representation can be thought of as an inverted tree. E.g. Modern computer operating system file-systems are a common example; and XML is another. ===Sorted or ordered data=== * Data has some inherent features when it is sorted on a key. All the values for subsets of the key appear together. When passing sequentially through groups of the data with the same key, or a subset of the key changes, this is referred to in data processing circles as a break, or a control break. It particularly facilitates aggregation of data values on subsets of a key. ===Peripheral storage=== * Until the advent of non-volatile computer memories like USB sticks, persistent data storage was traditionally achieved by writing the data to external block devices like magnetic tape and disk drives. These devices typically seek to a location on the magnetic media and then read or write blocks of data of a predetermined size. In this case, the seek location on the media, is the data key and the blocks are the data values. Early data file-systems, or disc operating systems used to reserve contiguous blocks on the disc drive for data files. In those systems, the files could be filled up, running out of data space before all the data had been written to them. Thus much unused data space was reserved unproductively to avoid incurring that situation. This was known as raw disk. Later file-systems introduced partitions. They reserved blocks of disc data space for partitions and used the allocated blocks more economically, by dynamically assigning blocks of a partition to a file as needed. To achieve this, the file-system had to keep track of which blocks were used or unused by data files in a catalog or file allocation table. Though this made better use of the disc data space, it resulted in fragmentation of files across the disc, and a concomitant performance overhead due to latency. Modern file systems reorganize fragmented files dynamically to optimize file access times. Further developments in file systems resulted in virtualization of disc drives i.e. where a logical drive can be defined as partitions from a number of physical drives. ===Indexed data=== * Retrieving a small subset of data from a much larger set implies searching though the data sequentially. This is uneconomical. Indexes are a way to copy out keys and location addresses from data structures in files, tables and data sets, then organize them using inverted tree structures to reduce the time taken to retrieve a subset of the original data. In order to do this, the key of the subset of data to be retrieved must be known before retrieval begins. The most popular indexes are the B-tree and the dynamic hash key indexing methods. Indexing is yet another costly overhead for filing and retrieving data. There are other ways of organizing indexes, e.g. sorting the keys or correction of quantities (or even the key and the data together), and using a binary search on them. ===Abstraction and indirection=== * Object orientation uses two basic concepts for understanding data and software: 1) The taxonomic rank-structure of program-code classes, which is an example of a hierarchical data structure; and 2) At run time, the creation of data key references to in-memory data- structures of objects that have been instantiated from a class library. It is only after instantiation that an executing object of a specified class exists. After an object's key reference is nullified, the data referred to by that object ceases to be data because the data key reference is null; and therefore the object also ceases to exist. The memory locations where the object's data was stored are then referred to as garbage and are reclassified as unused memory available for reuse. ===Database data=== * The advent of databases introduced a further layer of abstraction for persistent data storage. Databases use meta data, and a structured query language protocol between client and server systems, communicating over a network, using a two phase commit logging system to ensure transactional completeness, when persisting data. ===Parallel distributed data processing=== * Modern scalable / high performance data persistence technologies rely on massively parallel distributed data processing across many commodity computers on a high bandwidth network. An example of one is Apache Hadoop. In such systems, the data is distributed across multiple computers and therefore any particular computer in the system must be represented in the key of the data, either directly, or indirectly. This enables the differentiation between two identical sets of data, each being processed on a different computer at the same time. ==See also== * Assembly language * Big data * Bus (computing) * Byte * Computer memory * CPU * CPU cache * Data * Data dictionary * Data modeling * Data network * Data storage device * Data stream * Data type * Database * Databus * Data set * Digital data * Foreign key * Hash key * Information processor * Instruction set * Memory address/location/key * Offset (computer science) * Primary/unique key * Processor register * Shift register * State (computer science) * Tuple * Value (computer science) * Von Neumann architecture ==References== ","title":"Data (computing)"},{"id":"2234334","text":"An approved drug is a preparation that has been validated for a therapeutic use by a ruling authority of a government. This process is specific by country. == Process by country  United States === In the United States, the FDA approves drugs. Before a drug can be prescribed, it must undergo the FDA's approval process. Drug companies seeking to sell a drug in the United States must first test it. The company then sends the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) evidence from these tests to prove the drug is safe and effective for its intended use. A fee is required to make such FDA submission. For financial year 2020, this fee was: for an application requiring clinical data ($2,942,965) and for an application not requiring clinical data ($1,471,483). A team of CDER physicians, statisticians, chemists, pharmacologists, and other scientists reviews the company's data and proposed labeling. If this independent and unbiased review establishes that a drug's health benefits outweigh its known risks, the drug is approved for sale. The center doesn't actually test drugs itself, although it does conduct limited research in the areas of drug quality, safety, and effectiveness standards.

Bordered by 58th Street, 59th Street, Broadway, and Eighth Avenue, it stands on the site of the former seven-story Grand Circle Hotel. It opened in 1964, after A&P; heir Huntington Hartford hired architect Edward Durell Stone to build a museum for him at the site. Controversy was sparked in 2002 after the Museum of Arts and Design (MAD) purchased the building and planned to significantly alter its design, including modifying its facade. Calls had been made since 1996 for the building to be landmarked, so its proposed landmark status was brought into question with this renovation. The renovations were completed in 2008. ==HistoryEarly history and site, pre-renovation=== The seven-story Grand Circle Hotel, designed by William H.

Museum of the City of New York website In 1964, A&P; heir Huntington Hartford hired architect Edward Durell Stone to build a museum for him at 2 Columbus Circle. At the time Hartford had one of the world's greatest art collections, including works by Rembrandt, Monet, Manet, Turner, and Salvador Dalí. Hartford commissioned Dalí to paint a painting called The Discovery of America by Christopher Columbus for the opening, which attracted many celebrities, such as the Duke of Windsor. 2 Columbus Circle opened as the Gallery of Modern Art, displaying Hartford's collection. Until 2005, the building was a 12-story modernist structure,Pascucci, Denim (February 13, 2014). \\"2 Columbus Circle / Edward Durell Stone & Associates\\". ArchDaily marble-clad with Venetian motifs and a curved façade. It had filigree-like portholes and windows that ran along an upper loggia at its top stories. With architect Philip L. Goodwin, Stone had previously designed the Museum of Modern Art in the International style, which opened to the public on May 10, 1939. Hartford wanted his Gallery of Modern Art to represent an alternative view of modernism. The building was often called \\"The Lollipop Building\\" in reference to a mocking review by architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable in which she called it a \\"die-cut Venetian palazzo on lollipops\\".Dunlap, David W. (January 8, 2013). \\"Ada Louise Huxtable, Champion of Livable Architecture, Dies at 91\\". The New York Times However, three decades later she admitted that she got \\"a little lift, a sense of pleasure\\" when she walked past it. Nonetheless, Huxtable took issue with the campaign to save the building, writing in The Wall Street Journal that: \\"It was an unworthy performance that did little credit to anyone who cares about preservation and can only serve as an object lesson of how not to go about it.\\" The Gallery of Modern Art closed by 1969. Fairleigh Dickinson University received 2 Columbus Circle as a gift from Hartford and operated it as the New York Cultural Center, where art exhibitions were sometimes hosted. Six years later, Gulf and Western Industries purchased 2 Columbus Circle. In exchange for tax breaks, Sumner Redstone got a clause that Hartford had, which said that the building could never be renovated or destroyed. The building went unused until 1980, when Gulf and Western presented 2 Columbus Circle to the City of New York as a gift. The City of New York accepted 2 Columbus Circle and installed the headquarters for the Department of Cultural Affairs. The New York Convention and Visitors Bureau also began to be housed in 2 Columbus Circle. ===Museum of Arts and Design renovation=== The Museum of Arts and Design, now at 2 Columbus Circle, was founded in 1956 by the American Craft Council together with philanthropist Aileen Osborn Webb, as the Museum of Contemporary Crafts. It relocated to 40 West 53rd Street in 1986, and was renamed the American Craft Museum. In 2002, it changed its name again to the Museum of Arts and Design. Concurrently, interest in landmarking this building had begun in 1996, soon after the building turned thirty years old and became eligible for landmark designation. In this year, Robert A. M. Stern included it in his article \\"A Preservationist's List of 35 Modern Landmarks-in-Waiting\\" written for The New York Times. Stone's design at 2 Columbus Circle was listed as one of the World Monuments Fund's \\"100 most endangered sites\\" in 2006. The same year, Jennifer Raab, Chairman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, reviewed with the Designation Committee of the Commission the possibility of recommending a hearing on 2 Columbus Circle. In 1998, the Department of Cultural Affairs and the Convention and Visitors Bureau vacated 2 Columbus Circle, and in 2002, under Landmarks Preservation Commission Chairman Sherida Paulsen, the Designation Committee reviewed the request to hold a hearing and again voted not to. MAD was designated as the site developer of 2 Columbus Circle by the New York City Economic Development Corporation in June 2002. In 2004, the National Trust for Historic Preservation called it one of America's \\"11 Most Endangered Historic Places\\". Despite a serious preservation effort, the New York City Department of Buildings approved the permit for MAD to begin removing 2 Columbus Circle's facade. By the end of renovations in 2008, the museum moved to this building. The new location at 2 Columbus Circle, with more than , more than tripled the size of the Museum's former space. It includes four floors of exhibition galleries for works by established and emerging artists; a 150-seat auditorium in which the museum plans to feature lectures, films, and performances; and a restaurant. It also includes a Center for the Study of Jewelry, and an Education Center that offers multi-media access to primary source material, hands-on classrooms for students, and three artists-in-residence studios. Redesign and landmark controversy The museum's plans to radically alter the building's original designArchDaily: AD Classics: 2 Columbus Circle / Edward Durell Stone & Associates by Denim Pascucci (13 February 2014) touched off a preservation debate joined by many notable people, including Tom Wolfe (The New York Times; October 12, 2003 and October 13, 2003), Chuck Close, Frank Stella, Robert A. M. Stern, Columbia University art history department chairman Barry Bergdoll, New York Times architecture critics Herbert Muschamp and Nicolai Ouroussoff, and urbanist scholar Witold Rybczynski, among others. Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY) referred to it as \\"one of New York's most photographed and readily recognizable buildings.\\" However, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Ada Louise Huxtable, and others supported the redevelopment of the long-neglected site. Stone's building was listed as worthy of preservation by organizations, including: the New York/Tri-State Chapter of DOCOMOMO, the Historic Districts Council, the Municipal Art Society, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the New York Landmarks Conservancy, the Preservation League of New York State, and the World Monuments Fund. Despite this, the New York City Landmarks Commission never held a public hearing on its fate. E-mails obtained under the Freedom of Information Act between NYC Landmarks Commission chairman Robert Tierney and Laurie Beckelman, who worked for the Museum of Art and Design, suggest that the pair worked behind the scenes to keep the building from being considered by the landmarks panel. A city permit to allow removal of the existing facade was issued on June 29, 2005. The August 9, 2005, edition of The New York Times reported that members of the Landmarks Preservation Commission took the rare step of public disagreement over this issue, despite City Hall's insistence that the case against the building had been closed for nine years. Roberta Brandes Gratz, a commission member, said in a letter to The New York Times, \\"Neither I as an individual commissioner nor the current commission as a whole has rendered a 'professional judgment' on whether there should be a hearing or a designation.\\" In addition, telephone interviews conducted by The New York Times suggested that at least some of the other eleven commissioners also favored a public hearing. Yet the commission's executive director, Ronda Wist, said chairman Tierney \\"is not inclined to revisit this question.\\" Tierney said his principal architectural education occurred when he took an undergraduate course with Vincent Scully, now the Sterling professor emeritus of art history at Yale University. On August 14, 2005, Scully stated in a letter to Tierney: > Something rather wonderful has occurred, by which the building, rarely > anyone's favorite in the past, is looking better every day ... Its own > integrity, its uniqueness, the indomitable determination to make a point > that produced it, are coming to the fore and are powerfully affecting the > way we see it. ... It is in fact, becoming the icon it never was, one about > which the city now cares a great deal. The New York City Landmarks Commission's refusal to hold a public hearing on the building was based on a consensus reached in June 1996 by a four-member committee made up of the Rev. Thomas F. Pike, Charles Sachs, Vicki Match Suna, and Professor Sarah Bradford Landau. However, on August 18, 2005, The New York Times reported that Landau joined other former commissioners – William E. Davis, Stephen M. Raphael, Mildred F. Schmertz, along with Gene A. Norman, a former chairman, and Beverly Moss Spatt, a former chairwoman – in calling for a hearing. She wrote: > Had there been such a large and broad demand for a public hearing about the > building in 1996, I'm not at all sure I would have voted the way I did ... > It is in the long-term interest of the commission to maintain good rapport > with the preservation community.

During facade reconstruction On December 25, 2005, New York Times architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff wrote: > Recent landmark preservation battles in New York suggest that the civic > powers-that-be insist on defending a narrow view of the past and of > Modernism in particular.

In 2008, Ouroussoff named the renovated building as one of seven buildings in New York City that should be torn down because they \\"have a traumatic effect on the city.\\" He also wrote: > The renovation remedies the annoying functional defects that had plagued the > building for decades.

The redesigned building has the same massing and geometric shape as the original, but has channels carved in its exterior. The original white Vermont Marble has been replaced with a glazed terra-cotta and glass facade. Ada Louise Huxtable, who had originally coined the term \\"Lollipop Building\\" for the original structure, wrote: > Two Columbus Circle was on the down curve of an architect who had done his > best work in the 1930s ...

Of the newly uncovered redesign, James Gardner, architecture critic for the New York Sun wrote: > Say what you want about Stone's building, it was indubitably a landmark; the > best that can be said for its replacement is that, if we're lucky, no one > will ever notice it ...

Tung wrote a letter to Landmarks Commission Chair Robert B. Tierney, stating, \\"Simply, in the twenty-six years of my involvement in preservation matters, beginning with my appointment as a commissioner by Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1979, I have never seen the commission turn its back on such a widely supported and substantive argument for a hearing.\\" * September 2004 – Former Landmarks Commission Chair Beverly Moss Spatt wrote in a letter to current Chair Tierney that \\"a public hearing on 2 Columbus Circle is necessary to afford space and opportunity to hear from all sides whether it is not or is worthy of designation ... Good government is that government in which all people have a part.\\" * March 2005 – An article entitled, \\"In Preservation Wars, a Focus on Midcentury,\\" featured quotes from Robert A. M. Stern (\\"The commission ought to hear the arguments and let them be debated in a public forum – that's democracy.\\") Modern Architecture Working Group co-chair John Jurayj (\\"Modern preservation is in a major crisis in our city, a crisis that is shortly going to get worse unless the Landmarks Preservation Commission starts to act more aggressively.\\") and Landmark West! Executive Director Kate Wood (\\"If the Landmarks Commission held a public hearing for 2 Columbus Circle, literally hundreds of people would attend and testify – both for and against designation. The question is, what more will it take?\\") * May 2005 – The New York Times reported: \\"Not to preserve [2 Columbus Circle] is shocking, but not to hear it is criminal,\\" said architect and Yale Dean Robert A. M. Stern to fellow panelist Robert B. Tierney, Chair of the New York's Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC), at the 92nd Street Y. On the same subject, Crain's New York Business reported: \\"The battle between preservationists and the city over 2 Columbus Circle is about to get noisy again\\". Then, Landmark West! hired The Advance Group, the consultants behind the successful \\"Save the Plaza Hotel\\" campaign, to help convince the Bloomberg Administration to hold a landmark designation hearing on 2 Columbus Circle. At a May 16 City Council oversight hearing on the Landmarks Preservation Commission (only the third in the forty-year history of the agency), former Landmarks Commission Chair Gene A. Norman called on current Chair Tierney to hold a hearing on 2 Columbus Circle, arguing that \\"if people are preventing things from moving in a forward direction, they should be replaced.\\" Afterward, Nicolai Ouroussoff, chief architecture critic of The New York Times, wrote, \\"Representing a pivotal moment in architecture's eventual turn from mainstream Modernism, the Stone building's modest scale and concave facade are a gentle counterpoint to the new Time Warner Center's bland gigantism. Even so, the [Landmark's Preservation] commission declines to debate whether it deserves landmark status. Additionally, \\"Architecture Lovers Rally to Save 2 Columbus Circle\\" became the headline of an NY1 news report following a May 31 demonstration in front of the Museum of Arts and Design (MAD, formerly the American Craft Museum). Then, Landmark West! filed an Article 78 lawsuit against LPC Chair Robert B. Tierney, MAD and its affiliates Laurie Beckelman, Holly Hotchner, and Jerome Chazen for \\"conspiracy to obstruct and subvert the lawful functioning of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.\\" Holly Hotchner won the right to go ahead with her Portland architect for removing the outside of 2 Columbus Circle using the lawyer Charles Moerdler from Stroock Stroock and Lavan Law Firm. * June 2005 – Supporters of a public hearing for Edward Durell Stone's iconic 1964 design join hands in a \\"circle of support\\" all the way around the building's famous \\"lollipop\\" base at a rally on June 23. Then, the World Monuments Fund (WMF) included 2 Columbus Circle on its 2006 \\"Watch List\\" of the 100 Most Endangered Sites on earth. WMF's website (www.wmf.org) states, \\"The listing of 2 Columbus Circle highlights the widespread failure of public authorities to recognize the architectural merit of postwar buildings and sites as part of our collective cultural heritage.\\" The New York Times, New York magazine, and the Architect's Newspaper reported on \\"chummy\\" e-mail exchanges between NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission chair Robert Tierney and Laurie Beckelman, a representative from the Museum of Arts and Design soon after. Their relationship was described as a \\"conflict of interest\\" and \\"easily lead one to think that Tierney ... is in cahoots with MAD.\\" In one e-mail, Tierney tells Beckelman, \\"Let me know how I can help on the trouble ahead.\\" The e-mails were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by Landmarks West! * July 2005 – The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, announced in a letter to Landmarks West! that 2 Columbus Circle \\"does appear to meet the eligibility criteria for listing on the State and National Registers of Historic Places.\\" The State is reviewing the building's eligibility under criterion \\"C\\" for sites that \\"embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values...\\" The New York City Law Department then committed to a New York Supreme Court justice that the City \\"will neither close on the sale [of 2 Columbus Circle] nor authorize work under any existing building permits prior to either September 7, 2005\\" or the date of a court decision in the matter of Landmark West! et al. v. City of New York (one of three still-pending lawsuits brought by LW! and other citizens to prevent the defacement of 2 Columbus Circle without due process). * August 2005 – The New York Times reported in an article titled \\"Unanimity on a Building Is a Façade, Insiders Say\\": \\"The debate over whether 2 Columbus Circle merits consideration as an official landmark is playing out on the Landmarks Preservation Commission itself. A letter from Landmarks Commissioner Roberta Brandes Gratz to the editor of the Times \\"suggested that at least some of the 11 commissioners favor a public hearing, as did telephone interviews yesterday with several members.\\" ==ReferencesCategory:Museums in Manhattan Category:Edward Durell Stone buildings Category:Columbus Circle Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1964 ","title":"2 Columbus Circle"},{"id":"2234364","text":"Richard Verreau dans Faust de Gounod Richard Verreau, (January 1, 1926 - July 6, 2005) was a French-Canadian operatic tenor, particularly associated with the French and Italian repertories. ==Biography== Born Richard Verreault, in Chateau-Richer, near Québec City, he began singing as a child in church choir. He studied at the Laval University with Émile Larochelle. In 1949, on a Quebec government scholarship, he went to Paris and studied with Raoul Jobin. He made his debut at the Opéra de Lyon in 1951, where he sang the lead tenor roles in Lakmé, Manon, Mireille, and Les pêcheurs de perles. In Europe, Verreau performed in Belgium, Italy, Austria, and even Russia (then the USSR). He made his debut at the Royal Opera House in London, as the Duke in Rigoletto, in 1957, other roles there included: Alfredo in La traviata, Rodolfo in La bohème, Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly.

He appeared at the San Francisco Opera, as Roméo in Roméo et Juliette. He also performed as soloist with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Verreau was praised for the velvety quality of his voice, and his warm tone, unfortunately, an unsuccessful throat surgery ended his career in 1977. In 1998, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 2000, he was made an Officer of the National Order of Quebec. ==Sources== * The Encyclopedia of Music in Canada, Cécile Huot. ==External links== * Richard Verreau The Canadian Encyclopedia Category:1926 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Canadian operatic tenors Category:Officers of the National Order of Quebec Category:Officers of the Order of Canada Category:People from Capitale-Nationale Category:20th-century Canadian singers Category:20th-century opera singers Category:20th-century male singers Category:Université Laval alumni ","title":"Richard Verreau"},{"id":"2234365","text":"Goodbye Flatland is a 2003 album by Canadian alternative rock band 54-40. ==Track listing== # \\"Ride\\" – 3:53 # \\"Animal in Pain\\" – 2:50 # \\"Take Me Out\\" – 4:01 # \\"Hope the Hell I Haven't Died\\" – 3:11 # \\"Not Enough to Make You Happy\\" – 3:33 # \\"Who is Sylvia\\" – 4:18 # \\"Broken Girl\\" – 4:16 # \\"Goodbye Flatland\\" – 3:26 # \\"Secret\\" – 4:31 # \\"Giants\\" – 3:40 # \\"Seventeen On\\" – 4:23 # \\"Wish I Knew\\" – 2:48 ==Production== * Howard Redekopp - Producer, Engineer * Warne Livesey - Mixer Category:2003 albums Category:54-40 albums ","title":"Goodbye Flatland"},{"id":"2234374","text":"State Route 207 (SR 207) is a state highway in western Douglas County, Nevada, United States. Commonly known as the Kingsbury Grade, it is one of three Nevada highways that connects the western edge of the state to the Lake Tahoe region through the Carson Range. The route was part of State Route 19 prior to 1976. ==Route description== Stateline looking eastbound, October 2015 SR 207 begins at a junction with U.S. Route 50 in Stateline, less than from the California state line near the southern shores of Lake Tahoe. From there, the route heads eastward on an uphill climb through the Kingsbury area to travel through Daggett Pass (elevation ). After exiting the pass, SR 207 continues its trek eastward through Toiyabe National Forest lands. It goes through several switchbacks, eventually turning southward as it descends the mountains. The road goes down an escarpment to the Carson Valley floor. SR 207 comes to an end at its junction with Foothill Road (SR 206), at the site of Mottsville west of Gardnerville. ==History== View south towards Mottsville, Nevada and the Carson Valley from SR 207, October 2015 Historical marker #117 A road connecting Lake Tahoe to the Carson Valley, situated in the approximate location of today's SR 207, appears on Nevada state maps as early as 1919. By 1929, this unimproved road was included in the state highway system as the northwestern end of the former SR 19, a longer route stretching from Lake Tahoe through Minden and south to the California state line near Holbrook. This section of the former SR 19 was long, about of which comprised the Kingsbury Grade portion of highway. SR 19 through the mountains remained unimproved for many years; the route was not paved until 1967. By 1968, the eastern end of the Kingsbury Grade was moved southwards to line up with what is now Mottsville Lane, mirroring the approximately alignment of the present highway. Following the realignment, the Kingsbury Grade section of SR 19 was not altered until the 1976 renumbering of Nevada's state highway system on July 1, 1976. In that process, this portion of SR 19 was assigned to the new SR 207. This change was first seen on state highway maps in 1978. Also included in the new SR 207 was the section of Mottsville Lane which connects Kingsbury Grade to SR 88, making SR 207 about long; however, this section appears to have been removed from the route by 1983. The route has been largely unchanged since. ==Major intersections== ==See also== * List of state routes in Nevada * List of highways numbered 207 ==References== ==External links== 207 State Route 207 Category:Central Overland Route ","title":"Nevada State Route 207"},{"id":"2234377","text":"The Carol Duvall Show is an arts and crafts show which aired on the HGTV cable channel from 1994 to 2005 hosted by Carol Duvall.

It is located at the Howlands Farm site next to residences of Stephenson College and John Snow College. In the centre of the college is a grass-covered hill, called \\"The Mound.\\" It is a fully self-catered college of the University with facilities far more modern than any of the existing undergraduate colleges in Durham (the newest of which was opened in 1972) and all rooms are en-suite. The college bar is the largest of all the college bars in Durham, and has extensive leisure facilities, and a library area during the day. On 14 December 2005, it was announced that the college had been named after Josephine Butler, a Victorian feminist campaigner and a grand-niece of the 2nd Earl Grey, after whom Grey College was named. ==Shield and motto== The college arms are blazoned as \\"Gules on a chevron Or charged with a Cross formy, with cotises invected, between in chief two lions Argent and in base an open book charged with two covered cups\\". The arms represent in large the heritage of Josephine Butler, with the lion argent being a symbol of the Grey family, of which Earl Grey (whom Grey College is named after) was Josephine Butler's uncle. Further the covered cups on the pages of the books are a heraldic symbol of the Butler family. The college's motto is \\"Comme je trouve\\", which can be translated to \\"as I find\\" and is intended to mean 'we take life as we find it and make of it the best we can'. ==FacilitiesHowlands Building=== The Howlands building is shared with Butler's neighbouring college, Stephenson College. Howlands contains the college gym, laundry and music room. A large multi-purpose hall is also contained in the building that is used to host formal dinners and paves the way for some sports activities, where badminton and table tennis clubs practise. ===Butler Building=== The Butler building acts as the main social building of the college and mainly contains the college bar and some other rooms such as the college offices, porters lodge and reception, in addition to the JCR, the MCR, TV room, college library lounge, IT suite, and study spaces. ===Accommodation blocks and the Mound=== Kirknewton Building Butler is placed around the \\"Mound\\", which stands between Butler and Stephenson College. The college has four separate self-contained accommodation blocks; Kirknewton, Dilston, Milfield, Wooler, as well as a small fifth block called Elm. Each building is divided up into 6 bed-roomed flats, with en-suite facilities. The main four accommodation blocks are all named after locations related to Josephine Butler's life: she was born in Milfield, spent a lot of her early life in Dilston, died in Wooler and is buried in Kirknewton. In July 2017 Josephine Butler College accommodation was ranked fourth best student halls in the UK, based on analysis of over 10,000 student and graduate reviews.https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/news/top-50-student- accommodation-halls-uk ==Societies== The college has its own theatre company, Suffragette Theatre Company, as well as a Film Society and a Music Society. The JCR governs college societies. === Josephine Butler College Cricket Club (JBCCC) === Josephine Butler College Cricket Club (JBCCC) is the college's cricket team. As of 2018 the club consists of two outdoor sides, the A team and the Development team, and two indoor teams, an A and B team. Indoor cricket is played across the Epiphany term, and in the Easter term outdoor T20 cricket is played. The club won back to back indoor titles in 2014 and 2015. In 2018 they reached the final of the outdoor T20 competition. In the same year a 24-hour charity cricket match was held in the Howlands, which raised over £700 for the Glenn McGrath Foundation. ===Butler College Boat Club === Butler College Boat Club (BCBC) is the boat club of Josephine Butler College, at Durham University. The club is responsible for hosting its own inter- collegiate head race, Butler Head. In 2015 a BCBC VIII beat 3 other boats including the University of Leeds to get to the final of Durham Regatta. The biggest success came to the boat club in the 2016 Durham Regatta season where the 2015 BCBC VIII took the title of Durham Regatta by winning the Alderman Thurlow Trophy. === Suffragette Theatre Company === Suffragette Theatre Company (STC), formerly known as the Society of Theatrical Arts at Butler (STAB), is the Drama society for Josephine Butler College. The Theatre Company accepts members from in and outside of the college, and focuses on politically and socially charged productions, such as its production of 'The Tempest' at the Gala Theatre in June 2019.https://www.durhamstudenttheatre.org/society-of- theatrical-arts-at-butler The society is primarily known in college for its formal that is held in Michaelmas term every year, involving a Murder Mystery style format. ==List of principals== The head of College is titled the Principal.

It can reach a maximum length of over 1 meter in the wild, but has an average size of 12 inches in the aquarium. It is quite hardy and greedily accepts most foods, although some experimentation may be required to find the best food. The only other animals that are compatible with this species are snails, which they will ignore. A minimum aquarium size of 55 gallons is required, with bogwood or pieces of PVC pipe. They are active burrowers and will often remove the gravel from under their favorite hiding spot. A minimum temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit is necessary.

In 1982 signed a young Pedro Delgado who acted as a domestique for team leader Ángel Arroyo during the 1982 Vuelta a España. Arroyo won the Vuelta after his team controlled the race after he took the lead. But 48 hours after his Vuelta win, the results of a positive test were made known for Methylphenidate (Ritalin). Arroyo and the Reynolds team denied that Arroyo doped and asked for a B-analysis which confirmed the positive A-sample. Arroyo became the first winner of the Vuelta a España to be disqualified. Delgado changed teams in 1985 but returned to Reynolds in 1988 where he won the 1988 Tour de France and then the 1989 Vuelta a España with the team. In 1984, Miguel Indurain made his professional debut with the team. ===Banesto (1990–2003)=== In 1990, Spanish bank Banesto took over as the main sponsor of the team from Reynolds. Delgado was the team leader for the Tour de France while Miguel Indurain and Julián Gorospe were the leaders for the week long stage races. When Gorospe took the lead in that year's Vuelta, the team went behind him in a bid to win the race. However Gorospe lost the leader's jersey and Delgado took over the leadership but could not regain the time that Italian Marco Giovannetti had gained and ended the race second overall behind Giovannetti. Over the following years, Indurain rose to become a dominator of stage races winning five editions of the Tour de France and two editions of the Giro d'Italia. Delgado was the team leader for the Vuelta. The team also achieved success with Jean-François Bernard who won the 1992 edition of Paris–Nice with the team. The team won the Vuelta again in 1998 with Abraham Olano. During this time Alex Zülle joined the team and finished the 1999 Tour de France second overall while legendary climber José María Jiménez performed in the Vuelta a España. The team became known as iBanesto.com in the final years of the sponsorship of the Banesto bank. ===Illes Balears (2004–2005)=== In 2004, Illes Balears, the Balearic Island's Tourism Board, became the team's principal sponsor, the team's name was Illes Balears-Banesto until 2005. Caisse d'Epargne took over from Banesto as the second sponsor in the 2005 season, the team was then known as Illes Balears-Caisse d'Epargne. Caisse d'Epargne then became the main sponsor in 2006 reversing the title sponsor ordering with the name, Caisse d'Epargne-Illes Balears. The team fielded a number of strong contenders in the 2005 Tour de France including Francisco Mancebo (former National Champion of Spain), Alejandro Valverde, Vladimir Karpets and sprinter Isaac Gálvez. Mancebo produced the best results finishing fourth overall in the General Classification. ===Caisse d'Epargne (2006–2010)=== Caisse d'Epargne-Illes Balears finished fifth overall (56 minutes, 53 seconds behind Team T-Mobile) in the Team Classification at the 2006 Tour de France. Individually, the team's top rider, Óscar Pereiro, finished in second place. The Tour victory of Phonak rider Floyd Landis was almost immediately called into question, after a urine sample taken after his Stage 17 win twice tested positive for banned synthetic testosterone as well as a ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone nearly three times the limit allowed by World Anti-Doping Agency rules. After hearing of the positive \\"A\\" test, Pereiro stated that it was only an initial, unconfirmed result and he would not yet consider Landis guilty or himself the Tour winner. \\"I have too much respect for Landis to do otherwise\\", he said. After hearing that the Landis \\"B\\" test also came back positive, Pereiro stated that he now considers himself Tour champion and the Landis scandal should not diminish his own achievement. \\"Right now I feel like the winner of the Tour de France\\", Pereiro said. \\"It's a victory for the whole team.\\" After nearly two years of appeals, Pereiro was officially upgraded to Tour champion for 2006. ===Movistar (2011– )=== On 31 May 2010, the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld the appeals from WADA and the UCI regarding the suspension of Alejandro Valverde for his implication in the Operación Puerto doping case. Valverde was banned for two years, starting 1 January 2010 and after serving the two-year suspension returned to competition in 2012 riding for the Movistar Team. The 2011 season proved to be a transitional one for the team, with their first victory coming as a single stage win in the Tour Down Under, courtesy of Francisco Jose Ventoso. The team found success with stage wins in the Volta a Catalunya and Tour of the Basque Country. The team also won two stages of the Giro d'Italia: Ventoso won stage 6 and Vasil Kiryienka won stage 20. The team's final Grand Tour win came courtesy of Rui Costa in the Tour de France. The 2012 season saw the team re-establish itself as one of the major general classification contenders. The return of Valverde almost immediately brought the team success with a stage win in the Tour Down Under, followed by the overall win of the Vuelta a Andalucía as well as a stage win. Colombian new recruit Nairo Quintana also brought the team overall victory at the Vuelta a Murcia. The team scored multiple overall classification victories; Quintana claimed the Route du Sud, Rui Costa the Tour de Suisse, Javier Moreno the Vuelta a Castilla y León and finally Beñat Intxausti won the Vuelta a Asturias. The team also won stages in all three Grand Tours. The 2013 season closely followed the previous years, Valverde scored multiple early season results with the Trofeo Serra de Tramuntana and an overall win in the Vuelta a Andalucía. Quintana further reinforced his potential as a Grand Tour GC rider with the overall win in the Tour of the Basque Country as well as claiming second place in the Tour de France, taking the King of the Mountains in addition to the Young rider classification. He further reinforced his reputation as a force to be reckoned with, with an overall win in the Vuelta a Burgos. Intxausti got the team's final overall win of the year and Costa won the UCI World Road Race championships. For the 2014 season the team confirmed that they would shift from Pinarello bikes to Canyon Bicycles. For 2014, the team adopted a 'divide and conquer' based tactic for the season's Grand Tours; first sending Quintana to the Giro, Valverde to the Tour and then finally both riders to the Vuelta. Quintana achieved the team's first victory - winning stage 4 of the Tour de San Luis as well as the overall classification, Adriano Malori also won the individual time trial stage. Once again Valverde won the Vuelta a Andalucía as well as the Vuelta a Murcia, Roma Maxima, GP Miguel Indurain and La Flèche Wallonne. In May, Quintana won the team's first Grand Tour since Valverde's 2009 Vuelta victory, the 2014 Giro d'Italia. As with the previous season, Quintana defended his Vuelta a Burgos title winning it for the second straight year. In August 2014, the team announced the signing of Marc Soler () and Rubén Fernández () on a 2-year contract. At the 2015 Tour de France, the team finished first in the teams classification, and the two top men of the team, Nairo Quintana and Alejandro Valverde finished second and third in the general classification, respectively, with Quintana also winning the white jersey as best young rider, and finishing second in the king of the mountains classification. During the 2016 Tour, the team finished first in the teams classification by 8' 14\\" over Team Sky. Nairo Quintana made the podium by finishing third overall in the general classification standings and Ion Izagirre claimed victory on stage 20. Later during the 2016 Vuelta a España, Quintana won stage 10 and the overall. The team concluded the year with their fourth win in the team ranking of 2016 UCI World Tour. In 2019, Richard Carapaz won the Giro d'Italia, and the team won the team classification in all three Grand Tours. The team's season is captured in a documentary series, The Least Expected Day: Inside the Movistar Team 2019, available on Netflix. ==Team roster== ==Major wins== ==National, continental and world champions== ;1982 :20px Spain Road Race José Luis Laguía ;1983 :20px Spain Road Race Carlos Hernández ;1992 :20px Spain Road Race Miguel Indurain ;1995 :20px World Time Trial Miguel Indurain ;1997 :20px British Road Race Jeremy Hunt :20px Spain Road Race José María Jiménez ;1998 :20px World Time Trial Abraham Olano ;2003 :20px Spain Road Race Rubén Plaza ;2004 :20px Spain Road Race Francisco Mancebo :20px Spain Time Trial Jose Ivan Gutierrez ;2005 :20px Spain Time Trial Jose Ivan Gutierrez ;2006 :20px France Road Race Florent Brard ;2007 :20px Spain Road Race Joaquim Rodríguez :20px Spain Time Trial Jose Ivan Gutierrez ;2008 :20px Spain Road Race Alejandro Valverde :20px Spain Time Trial Luis León Sanchez ;2010 :20px Spain Road Race Jose Ivan Gutierrez :20px Spain Time Trial Luis León Sanchez :20px Portugal Time Trial Rui Costa ;2011 :20px Spain Road Race Jose Joaquin Rojas ;2012 :20px Spain Road Race Francisco Ventoso :20px Belarus Time Trial Branislau Samoilau ;2013 :20px British Time Trial Alex Dowsett :20px Spain Time Trial Jonathan Castroviejo :20px Portugal Time Trial Rui Costa :20px Spain Road Race Jesús Herrada :20px World Road Race Rui Costa ;2014 :20px Spain Time Trial Alejandro Valverde :20px Spain Road Race Ion Izagirre :20px Italy Time Trial Adriano Malori ;2015 :20px British Time Trial Alex Dowsett :20px Italy Time Trial Adriano Malori :20px Spain Time Trial Jonathan Castroviejo :20px Spain Road Race Alejandro Valverde ;2016 :20px British Time Trial Alex Dowsett :20px Spain Time Trial Ion Izagirre :20px Portugal Time Trial Nelson Oliveira :20px Spain Road Race José Joaquín Rojas :20px European Time Trial Jonathan Castroviejo ;2017 :20px Spain Time Trial Jonathan Castroviejo :20px Spain Road Race Jesús Herrada ;2018 :20px World Road Race Alejandro Valverde ;2019 :20px Spain Road Race Alejandro Valverde ==Former riders== ==See also== * *List of cycling teams in Spain ==References== ==External links== * Movistar Category:Cycling teams based in Spain Category:Cycling teams established in 1980 Category:Telefónica Category:1980 establishments in Spain ","title":"Movistar Team (men's team)"},{"id":"2234410","text":"William Lawrence (September 2, 1814 - September 8, 1895) was a member of the United States House of Representatives from the 17th District of Ohio.

Monkeys and darts of the same colour correspond to their positions at the same moment in time. In the SVG file, hover over a monkey or dart to highlight those contemporaneous with it. Note that monkey and darts remain in a line parallel to the line connecting their initial positions. \\"The monkey and the hunter\\" is a physics demonstration often used to illustrate the effect of gravity on projectile motion. No live monkey is used in the demonstrations. The essentials of the problem are stated in many introductory guides to physics. In essence, the problem is as follows: A hunter with a blowgun goes out in the woods to hunt for monkeys and sees one hanging in a tree. The monkey releases its grip the instant the hunter fires his blowgun. Where should the hunter aim in order to hit the monkey? == Discussion == To answer this question, recall that according to Galileo's law, all objects fall with the same constant acceleration of gravity (about 9.8 metres per second per second near the Earth's surface), regardless of the object's weight. Furthermore, horizontal motions and vertical motions are independent: gravity acts only upon an object's vertical velocity, not upon its velocity in the horizontal direction. The hunter's dart, therefore, falls with the same acceleration as the monkey. Assume for the moment that gravity was not at work. In that case, the dart would proceed in a straight-line trajectory at a constant speed (Newton's first law). Gravity causes the dart to fall away from this straight-line path, making a trajectory that is in fact a parabola. Now, consider what happens if the hunter aims directly at the monkey, and the monkey releases his grip the instant the hunter fires. Because the force of gravity accelerates the dart and the monkey equally, they fall the same distance in the same time: the monkey falls from the tree branch, and the dart falls the same distance from the straight-line path it would have taken in the absence of gravity. Therefore, the dart will always hit the monkey, no matter the initial speed of the dart, no matter the acceleration of gravity. Another way of looking at the problem is by a transformation of the reference frame. Earlier the problem was stated in a reference frame in which the Earth is motionless. However, for very small distances on the surface of Earth the acceleration due to gravity can be considered constant to good approximation. Therefore, the same acceleration acts upon both the dart and the monkey throughout the fall. Transform the reference frame to one that is accelerated upward by the amount with respect to the Earth's reference frame (which is to say the acceleration of the new frame with respect to the Earth is ). Because of Galilean equivalence, the (approximately) constant gravitational field (approximately) disappears, leaving us with only the horizontal velocity of both the dart and the monkey. In this reference frame the hunter should aim straight at the monkey, since the monkey is stationary. Since angles are invariant under transformations of reference frames, transforming back to the Earth's reference frame the result is still that the hunter should aim straight at the monkey. While this approach has the advantage of making the results intuitively obvious, it suffers from the slight logical blemish that the laws of classical mechanics are not postulated within the theory to be invariant under transformations to non-inertial (accelerated) reference frames (see also principle of relativity). ==References== == External links == * An intuitive explanation: http://BrainExperiments.com/MonkeyAndHunter.aspx ","title":"Monkey and hunter"},{"id":"2234430","text":"A turnover is a type of pastry or bread made by placing a filling on a piece of dough, folding the dough over, sealing, and baking it. Turnovers can be sweet or savory and are often made as a sort of portable meal or dessert, similar to a sandwich. They are often eaten for breakfast. It is common for sweet turnovers to have a fruit filling and be made with a puff pastry or shortcrust pastry dough and covered with icing; savory turnovers generally contain meat and/or vegetables and can be made with any sort of dough, though a kneaded yeast dough seems to be the most common in Western cuisines. They are usually baked, but may be fried. Savory turnovers are often sold as convenience foods in supermarkets. Savory turnovers with meat or poultry and identified as a turnover in the United States (for example, \\"Beef Turnover\\" or \\"Cheesy Chicken Turnover\\") have to meet a standard of identity or composition and should contain a certain amount of meat or poultry.Refer to the United States Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book entries for \\"Turnover\\" and \\"Poultry Turnover.\\" ==Names== A meat or vegetarian turnover may be called a \\"patty\\" in South Asian and Caribbean cuisine, e.g. a South Asian chicken patty, a Jamaican patty, a Haitian patty. It may be a \\"pasty\\" in Cornish cooking. ==Fillings== Common turnover fillings include fruits such as apples, peaches and cherries, meats like chicken, beef and pork, vegetables such as potatoes, broccoli and onions, and savory ingredients like cheese. Specialty versions are also found, such as wild rabbit and leek. In the United Kingdom turnovers are usually filled with cooked apples, but any fruit can be used, as described in Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management.http://appleturnover.tv/2012/05/mrs_beetons/ Another type of turnover, a calzone, originated in Naples in the 18th Century.

Ibrahim was from the Koba branch of the Zaghawa ethnic group, which is located mainly in Sudan, with a minority on the Chad side of the border. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the National Islamic Front (NIF) seizure of power under the direction of Islamist Hassan al-Turabi in 1989. He also served as the state minister for education in Darfur between 1991 and 1994 in al-Fashir, North Darfur. A physician, Dr. Khalil spent four months in 1992 to fight Sudan People's Armed Forces. By Ibrahim's own account, he was disaffected with the Islamist movement by 2000 after seeing the economic neglect of the NIF, as well as its support to armed militias. At this time, he became part of a covert cell of Islamists who were seeking to change the NiF from inside. Dr. Ibrahim went on to serve as the state minister for social affairs in Blue Nile in 1997 before a post as adviser to the governor of Southern Sudan in Juba in 1998. However, others noted that he never received a national level appointment. Ibrahim's colleague in JEM, Ahmad Tugod, stated, \\"Khalil is not a first or even second class political leader. [...] He struggled all of his life to get a post in Khartoum.\\"Flint, Julie and Alex de Waal, Darfur: A Short History of a Long War, Zed Books, London March 2006, , p. 91 He quit the post in August 1998, several months before the end of his appointment, and formed an NGO called \\"Fighting Poverty\\". In December 1999, when al-Bashir sidelined al-Turabi with the help of Ali Osman Taha, Dr. Ibrahim was in the Netherlands, studying for a Masters in Public Health at Universiteit Maastricht. In the meantime, the structure of covert cells that Ibrahim had helped set up in 1994 had spread to Khartoum. The dissidents, dubbing themselves \\"The Seekers of Truth and Justice\\" published the Black Book in 2000, claiming that riverine Arabs dominated political power and resources. In 2001, Khalil Ibrahim was one of twenty people sent out of the country by the dissidents to go public. In August 2001, Ibrahim published a press release from the Netherlands, in which he announced the formation of the Justice and Equality Movement. The JEM has a relatively small ethnic base of support, being limited to the Kobe Zaghawa, including many kinsmen from across the Chadian border. Ibrahim received political and financial support from Libya and its leader Muammar Gaddafi. After the NTC's win in the 2011 Libyan civil war against the government of the Jamahiriya he was forced to flee back to Darfur. ==Darfur conflict== On 5 March 2002, Dr. Ibrahim claimed credit for initiating a government revolt. This apparent claim of the landmark attack on Golo, actually carried out by the Sudan Liberation Army, was mocked by the SLA and the JEM was forced to back away from their announcement. Regardless, the JEM and the anti-government SLA formed a loose alliance in prosecuting the Darfur conflict. In May 2006, the JEM rejected the Abuja peace process, which was accepted by the faction of the SLA led by Minni Minnawi, but rejected by the smaller SLA factions. On 30 June 2006, Ibrahim, Khamis Abdalla, the leader of an SLM faction, Dr Sharif Harir and Ahmed Ibrahim, co-leaders of the National Democratic Alliance (Sudan), founded the National Redemption Front rebel group in Asmara, Eritrea but which is based in Chad. Ibrahim lived in exile in Libya from May 2010 to September 2011, when the Libyan civil war compelled him to flee across the Sahara and return to Darfur. The Sudanese government and diplomatic sources accused Ibrahim's group of rebels in Libya of fighting as mercenaries for Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi during the war, charges to which Ibrahim never responded. ==Death== The Sudan Armed Forces announced that it had killed Ibrahim with an air strike in North Kordofan on 25 December 2011. == References == Category:1957 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Zaghawa people Category:People from North Darfur Category:People of the War in Darfur Category:Sudanese Islamists Category:Deaths by airstrike ","title":"Khalil Ibrahim"},{"id":"2234456","text":"The Dance Music Hall of Fame was an organization established in 2003 to honor and remember significant contributors to the genre of dance music.

It usually also includes french fries, coleslaw, hushpuppies, lemon slices, tartar sauce, hot sauce, malt vinegar and dessert. Some Native American versions are cooked by coating fish with semolina and egg yolk. Fish is often served on Friday nights during Lent as a restaurant special or through church fundraisers. Beer is a common beverage of choice to accompany a fish fry. A fish fry may include potato pancakes (with accompanying side dishes of sour cream or applesauce) and sliced caraway rye bread if served in a German restaurant or area. A \\"shore lunch\\" is traditional in the northern United States and Canada. For decades, outdoor enthusiasts have been cooking their catch on the shores of their favorite lakes. Fish fries are very common in the Midwestern and northeastern regions of the United States. This is especially true for predominantly Roman Catholic communities on Fridays during Lent, when regulations call for abstinence from most meat products. == Lenten fish fries == The tradition of Christians fasting on Fridays to recognize Jesus's crucifixion on Good Friday dates to the first century AD. Fish had been associated with religious holidays even in pre-Christian times. The first mention of fish in connection with Lent comes from Socrates of Constantinople, a church historian in the third and fourth centuries who spoke of abstaining from meat and meat products (such as cheese and eggs) during the 40 days of Lent. The custom was mentioned by Pope Gregory I, who was elected in 590, and was later incorporated into canon law. Roman Catholic tradition has been that the flesh of warm-blooded animals is off limits on Fridays, although the 1983 Code of Canon Law provided for alternative observances of the Friday penance outside Lent. McDonald's addition of the Filet-o-Fish to its menu occurred when a Cincinnati franchise in a heavily Catholic neighborhood was struggling to sell hamburgers on Fridays during Lent. ==Northeastern United States== Battered or breaded haddock and cod fish fry is one of the trademarks of upstate New York cuisine and northwestern Pennsylvania, especially Albany, Buffalo and Rochester, as well as Syracuse, New York, and Utica, New York. The majority of restaurants in these cities serve a fish fry on Friday, even outside Lent, and it's often available throughout the week. These meals typically consist of a piece of fish, coleslaw (sometimes potato salad or macaroni salad), french fries, and a dinner roll. ==Southeastern United States== In the southern United States, a fish fry is a family or social gathering, held outdoors or in large halls. At a typical fish fry, quantities of fish (such as bream, catfish, flounder and bass) available locally are battered and deep fried in cooking oil. The batter usually consists of corn meal, milk or buttermilk, and seasonings. In addition to the fish, hushpuppies (deep fried, seasoned corn dumplings), and cole slaw are served. These events are often potluck affairs. In Georgia and South Carolina, fish are dipped in milk, then into a mix of flour, cornmeal and seasonings before frying. Cheese grits is often a side dish. == Midwestern United States == The modern fish fry tradition is strong in Wisconsin, where hundreds of eateries hold fish fries on Fridays, and sometimes on Wednesdays. The Friday night fish fry is a popular-year round tradition in Wisconsin among people of all religious backgrounds. Fish fries there are offered at many non-chain restaurants, taverns that serve food, some chain restaurants, and at Roman Catholic churches as fundraisers. A typical Wisconsin fish fry consists of beer batter fried cod, perch, bluegill, walleye, smelt, or in areas along the Mississippi River, catfish. The meal usually comes with tartar sauce, french fries or German-style potato pancakes, coleslaw, and rye bread, though baked beans are not uncommon. The tradition in Wisconsin began because Wisconsin was settled heavily by Catholics of German, Polish, and other backgrounds whose religion forbade eating meat on Fridays. The number of lakes in the state meant that eating fish became a popular alternative. Scandinavian settlements in northern and eastern Wisconsin favored the fish boil, a variant on the fish fry, which involves heating potatoes, white fish, and salt in a large cauldron. ==See also== * Burgoo, a Southern stew that is sometimes a church fundraiser * Fasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church * Fish and chips * Fish boil * Fish (fry), a juvenile fish * Pescado frito * Seafood boil * Stamp and Go, Jamaican breakfast fish fritter * Wurst mart, a sausage cook event ==References== Fry Category:Cuisine of Wisconsin Category:Cuisine of the Southern United States Category:Cuisine of the Midwestern United States Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Fish fry"},{"id":"2234459","text":"By the Book may refer to: * By the Book (novel), a 2002 Star Trek: Enterprise novel * \\"By the Book\\" (song), a 1999 song by Michael Peterson * \\"By the Book\\", a first season television episode of 8 Simple Rules * \\"By the Book\\", a controversial mission in the video game Grand Theft Auto V * By the Book (film), a 2013 film by Milan J.

He is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame for his contributions while playing for the Washington State Cougars. ==Early life and high school== He first gained notoriety as a running back at North Battleford Comprehensive High School in North Battleford, Saskatchewan. In 1980, Mayes led the NBCHS Vikings to an undefeated season and the SHSAA 3A provincial football championship. In 1981, he set a provincial record in the 100 metres at the SHSAA provincial track and field championship that still stands. ==College career== Mayes played college football at the Washington State University in Pullman, where he was recognized as a consensus All-American and finished tenth in the Heisman Trophy voting in 1984. Mayes set single-season and career-rushing school records (1,632; 3,519 yards) with the Cougars, and established an NCAA record for most rushing yards in one game (357 at Oregon in 1984). It was the Pacific-10 Conference record for over a quarter century, until broken by Ka'Deem Carey in 2012. In 1995, a panel of experts commissioned by The Spokesman-Review named Mayes to the all-time WSU team. The honor was repeated in 1998 by Cougfan.com when it picked its list of the school's all-time greatest players. On May 1, 2008 he was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame. In August 2017, a group of panelists commissioned by the Pac-12 Network picked the 12 greatest Washington State players of all time and Mayes ranked No. 1. ==Professional career== Mayes was selected in the third round (57th overall) of the 1986 NFL Draft by the New Orleans Saints. He won the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Award that year from the Associated Press, and although his NFL career was hampered by injuries, he was named to the Pro Bowl twice. After five seasons with the Saints, Mayes was traded to the Seattle Seahawks in April 1992, where he played the final two years of his career. ===Statistics=== { class=  +Rueben Mayes statistics ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Team ! colspan=\\"2\\"Games ! colspan=\\"5\\"Rushing ! colspan=\\"5\\"Receiving - !

His son Logan was a three-star recruited linebacker at Marist Catholic High School in Eugene, Oregon, and committed to play at Washington State, following his father's footsteps. Mayes is one of the only five Saskatchewan natives to make it to the NFL, the others were Arnie Weinmeister, Jon Ryan, Ben Heenan, and Brett Jones. Mayes was the subject of a 1989 documentary film, The Saint from North Battleford, directed by Selwyn Jacob. ==ReferencesNFL stats Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:All-American college football players Category:American football running backs Category:Black Canadian players of American football Category:Canadian expatriate American football people in the United States Category:Canadian players of American football Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:National Conference Pro Bowl players Category:National Football League Offensive Rookie of the Year Award winners Category:New Orleans Saints players Category:Sportspeople from North Battleford Category:Seattle Seahawks players Category:Sportspeople from Saskatchewan Category:Washington State Cougars football players ","title":"Rueben Mayes"},{"id":"2234553","text":"An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.ICH GCP AEs in patients participating in clinical trials must be reported to the study sponsor and if required could be reported to local ethics committee. Adverse events categorized as \\"serious\\" (results in death, illness requiring hospitalization, events deemed life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect or medically important condition) must be reported to the regulatory authorities immediately, whereas non-serious adverse events are merely documented in the annual summary sent to the regulatory authority. The sponsor collects AE reports from the local researchers, and notifies all participating sites of the AEs at the other sites, as well as both the local investigators' and the sponsors' judgment of the seriousness of the AEs. This process allows the sponsor and all the local investigators access to a set of data that might suggest potential problems with the study treatment while the study is still ongoing. ==Types of adverse events== All clinical trials have the potential to produce AEs. AEs are classified as serious or non-serious; expected or unexpected; and study-related, possibly study-related, or not study-related. For example, while a study that tests the effectiveness of a new blood pressure cuff for a period of 10 minutes might seem innocuous, the potential exists for the patient's skin to be irritated by the device. Patients in that study might also die during that 10-minute period. Both skin irritation and sudden death would be considered AEs. In this case, the skin irritation would be classified as not serious, unexpected, and possibly study-related. The death would be classified as serious and unexpected (unless the patient was already at death's door). The local researcher would use his/her medical judgment to determine whether the death could have been related to the study device. Both the skin irritation and the death are unexpected events, and should alert the researcher to the potential existence of a problem with the device (for instance, it could have malfunctioned and shocked the patient). The researcher would report these AEs to the local Institutional Review Board and to the sponsor, and await direction on whether to stop the study. If the researcher feels there is an imminent danger posed by the device, he or she can use medical discretion to stop patients from participating in the study. An adverse event can also be declared in the normal treatment of a patient which is suspected of being caused by the medication being taken or a medical device used in the treatment of the patient. In Australia, 'Adverse EVENT' refers generically to medical errors of all kinds, surgical, medical or nursing related. The most recent available official study (1995) indicated 18,000 deaths per year are a result of hospital care. The Medical Error Action Group is lobbying for legislation to improve the reporting of AEs and through quality control, minimize the needless deaths. ==Reporting of adverse events== Researchers participating in a clinical trial must report all adverse events to the drug regulatory authority of the respective country where the drug or device is to be registered [e.g. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) if it is US]. Serious AEs must be reported immediately; minor AEs are 'bundled' by the sponsor and submitted later. ==Grades of AE== Clinical trial results often report the number of grade 3 and grade 4 adverse events. Grades are defined:Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events *Grade 1 Mild AE *Grade 2 Moderate AE *Grade 3 Severe AE *Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE *Grade 5 Death related to AE ==Database of adverse events== The FDA provides a database for reporting of adverse events called the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database (MAUDE)[1]. The data consist of voluntary reports since June 1993, user facility reports since 1991, distributor reports since 1993, and manufacturer reports since August 1996, and is open for public view. Two private companies have also recently started providing access to analyzed adverse event information: Clarimed provides adverse event information for medical devices and AdverseEvents provides adverse event data for drugs. == See also == * Clinical trial * Complication (medicine) * Good clinical practice (GCP) * Data monitoring committees * Serious adverse event * Adverse effect * Adverse drug reaction * Pharmacovigilance * EudraVigilance (European Union AE reporting and evaluating network) * Clinical Trials Directive (Directive 2001/20/EC by European Union) * Adverse Event Reporting System * Yellow Card Scheme == References == == External links == *ClinicalTrials.gov from US National Library of Medicine *ICH Website *FDA Website Category:Clinical research Category:Pharmaceutical industry ","title":"Adverse event"},{"id":"2234555","text":"Colonel José María San Martín (29 March 1811 - 12 August 1857) was a military officer, politician and President of El Salvador. == Early life == Born in Nacaome, Honduras to Colonel Joaquín de San Martín and Joaquina Fugón,http://archive.laprensa.com.sv/20040822/opinion/opinion1.asp La Prensa Grafica, 22 August 2004, La distinguida genealogía de los San Martín he moved with his family to Chalatenango, El Salvador as a child.

Adverse events are further defined as “Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.” ==Research== Investigators in human clinical trials are obligated to report these events in clinical study reports. Research suggests that these events are often inadequately reported in publicly available reports. Because of the lack of these data and uncertainty about methods for synthesising them, individuals conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of therapeutic interventions often unknowingly overemphasise health benefit. To balance the overemphasis on benefit, scholars have called for more complete reporting of harm from clinical trials. ==Related terms== Serious adverse reactions are serious adverse events judged to be related to drug therapy. A SUSAR (suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction) should be reported to a drug regulatory authority under an investigational license by using the CIOMS form (or in some countries an equivalent form). \\"Unexpected\\" means that for an authorised (approved) medicinal product that the event is not described in the product's labeling, or in the case of an investigational (unapproved) product that the event is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure.

It is presented from the perspective of within the story. When the author steps in and speaks directly to the reader, that is more properly considered an afterword. The opposite is a prologue--a piece of writing at the beginning of a work of literature or drama, usually used to open the story and capture interest. Some genres, for example television programs and video games, call the epilogue an \\"outro\\" patterned on the use of \\"intro\\" for \\"introduction\\". ==In literature== Grandville. An epilogue is the final chapter at the end of a story that often serves to reveal the fates of the characters. Some epilogues may feature scenes only tangentially related to the subject of the story. They can be used to hint at a sequel or wrap up all the loose ends. They can occur at a significant period of time after the main plot has ended. In some cases, the epilogue is used to allow the main character a chance to \\"speak freely\\". An epilogue can continue in the same narrative style and perspective as the preceding story, although the form of an epilogue can occasionally be drastically different from the overall story. It can also be used as a sequel. ==In opera== Because commenting on past action is inherently undramatic, few operas have epilogues, even those with prologues. Among those explicitly called epilogues are the concluding scenes of Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress and Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann. Other operas whose final scenes could be described as epilogues are Mozart's Don Giovanni, Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov, and Delius's Fennimore and Gerda. ==In film== In films, the final scenes may feature a montage of images or clips with a short explanation of what happens to the characters. A few examples of such films are 9 to 5, American Graffiti, National Lampoon's Animal House, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Remember the Titans, and Changeling. The epilogue of La La Land shows a happy ending, an alternative to the actual ending. In many documentaries and biopics, the epilogue is text-based, explaining what happened to the subjects after the events covered in the film. ==In video games== In video games, epilogues can occur at the end of the story, usually after the credits have rolled. An epilogue in a game functions similarly to an epilogue in film and literature, providing closure to the end of a story. However, the way in which a video game epilogue is interacted with can then determine how the story ends in works of fiction that contain multiple endings. For example, there are four possible endings to the 2012 video game Spec Ops: The Line, and three of the endings are chosen by what the player does in the epilogue. In video games that allow the permanent death of playable characters, an epilogue can chronicle what happened to the playable characters who survived and depict how their situation has changed after the story has ended. For example, the 2015 video game Until Dawn features characters who survived (if any) recounting their experiences to the police after being rescued. This system can also be expanded; relationships can be built between characters in most games of the Fire Emblem series, allowing for unique outcomes for characters depending on the actions of the player throughout the campaign. A visual novel can also feature a type of epilogue, which will wrap up all of the scenarios encountered by a player, most often after the game has been fully completed by reaching all of the multiple endings; as is the case with Tsukihime, featuring an epilogue that expands on the endings of all completable routes, as well as providing context for the rest of the game by explaining events in the prologue. ==In television== For many years The Epilogue, a reflective 5-minute sermonette, was the last programme of the day broadcast on a Sunday evening by BBC radio and later television. The format was picked up by the independent broadcaster ITV in 1956 and was adopted across its various franchises until 1988. ==See also== * Conclusion * Fortspinnung * Prologue ==References== ==External links== * Category:Book design Category:Literature Category:Fiction Category:Style (fiction) ","title":"Epilogue"},{"id":"2234575","text":"Tom York (born November 30, 1924) is an American television personality, who worked for WBRC in Birmingham, Alabama from 1957 to 1989. == Early life and education == York was born in Holland, Missouri. He served in the United States Navy as an aviation radioman and gunner during World War II. He graduated from Florence State Teachers College (now the University of North Alabama), then worked as a radio host in North Alabama before moving to Birmingham. == Career == While he served in several capacities with the station, he is best remembered for The Tom York Morning Show, which was the station's primary morning show for 32 years. During the early 1960s, Fannie Flagg served as his co-host. The show was so popular that when WBRC's parent network, ABC, premiered its own morning show, Good Morning America, WBRC refused to carry it since it would have required moving York's show to another timeslot or canceling it altogether. WBRC began airing the second hour of GMA in the early-1980s, and only began airing the entire show in 1989 after York retired. Since retiring from broadcast television, York has worked as a weekly columnist for his hometown newspaper, The Hoover Gazette, from 2006 until shortly before the newspaper's demise in 2007. York won a regional Emmy Award in 1995. York was the master of ceremonies for the induction ceremonies for the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame for more than a quarter century, and was himself inducted into ASHOF in 1996.

According to their mission statement: Other Minds, Inc., is dedicated to the encouragement and propagation of contemporary music in all its forms through concerts, workshops and conferences that bring together artists and audiences of diverse traditions, generations and cultural backgrounds. By fostering cross-cultural exchange and creative dialogue and by encouraging exploration of areas in new music seldom touched upon by mainstream music institutions, Other Minds is committed to expanding and reshaping the definition of what constitutes \\"serious music.\\". The name \\"Other Minds\\" has been attributed by Jim Newman to an anonymous obituary that ran in the New Yorker in 1992 which stated that John Cage \\"...composed music in other people's minds.\\"Website for Other Minds Other Minds has achieved wide recognition and acclaim including the ASCAP award in 2009 for adventurous programming and the American Music Center's 2005 letter of distinction for service to American composers. ==Concerts== Since 1993 they have presented an annual concert series featuring a wide range of composers from every part of the world, some well-known, some rising stars who reflect the aesthetic of Other Minds. These concerts are produced in conjunction with an artist residency retreat held at the Djerassi Resident Artists Program in Woodside, California just south of San Francisco in which that year's artists have an opportunity to share their work with each other prior to the festival performances. In addition Other Minds organizes occasional concerts and events known as \\"New Music Seances\\" in various venues in the Bay Area throughout the year featuring live performances with local artists of music by undeservedly lesser known past masters such as Henry Cowell, Ruth Crawford, Dane Rudhyar, Alan Hovhaness and Lester Bowie. The annual concert series usually occurs in early March and is currently being held at the Taube Atrium Theater and the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Theater. Composers represented in the annual festival have included such artists as Meredith Monk, Muhal Richard Abrams, Terry Riley, Philip Glass, Frederic Rzewski, Margaret Leng Tan, Henry Brant, Conlon Nancarrow, Robert Ashley, Pauline Oliveros, Lou Harrison, Laurie Anderson, LaMonte Young, Leroy Jenkins, Janice Giteck, Kyle Gann, Olly Wilson, William Parker, Gavin Bryars, Michael Nyman, Brian Eno and many others. Henry Brant's Pulitzer Prize winning Ice Field from 2001 was an Other Minds commission. Grawemeyer Award winner Louis Andriessen was recently featured as was MacArthur Fellow Jason Moran. ==Preservation & Online Archives== radiOM logo Since 2000, Other Minds has been involved in preserving audiovisual materials which includes an extensive audio collection from the KPFA Music Dept. Archives, as well as the organization's own programming collection. In 2002 Other Minds inaugurated a free online archive called radiOM,radiOM.org where users can access hundreds of hours of archival audio material including interviews with prominent composers of our time, past OM festival performances, examples of sound poetry, and much more. ==Weekly Radio Program== Executive Director Charles Amirkhanian in his office with ASCAP award in background Music from Other MindsMusic From Other Minds is a weekly program produced and hosted by Charles Amirkhanian and Other Minds staff.

The change to the Roman Method led Colmán to leave and travel back to Scotland and eventually, back to Iona. Later tradition states that between the years 665 and 667, Colman founded several churches in Scotland before returning to Iona. However, there are no seventh-century records of such activity by him. From Iona he sailed for Ireland, settling at Inishbofin in 668 ADGrattan-Flood, William. \\"St. Colman.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 4.

This was reputed to be in Mayo Abbey until its vanishment during the Reformation in 1537. Colman was stepping into a landscape that had been decimated by the plague of 664-665. He may have been reviving an earlier church on the island or one in the area in central Connacht where Mag Éo was founded later. On Inishbofin a rift occurred between the Irish and the English \\"because in summer the Irish went off to wander on their own around places they knew instead of assisting at harvest, and then, as winter approached, came back and wanted to share whatever the English monks had gathered.\\" What was the reason for their intermittent absence? Earlier commentators suspected that the two nations came from different agricultural backgrounds and that the Irish intermittently removed themselves from the island with the monastery’s livestock for the purpose of ‘booleying’, a form of transhumance. It is also possible that the Irish visited their kinsfolk on the mainland. Returning to the island in winter, they helped to consume the fruits of the Saxons' labours. This situation inevitably led to tensions within the community. Disputes arose between the Saxon and Irish monks after a short time. Colman brought his Saxon followers onto the mainland and founded a monastery for them at \\"Magh Eó\\" - the Plain of Yew Trees, subsequently known as \\"Mayo of the Saxons\\". Colman's last days were spent on the island of Inishbofin, where he died in 674.Brett, Joe. \\"The Monastic Settlement of 'Mayo of the Saxons'\\", Mayo Abbey Parish Magazine, 1994 His feast is celebrated on 8 August and on 13 November. ==Citations== ==References== * * Walsh, Michael A New Dictionary of Saints: East and West London: Burns & Oats 2007 ==External links== * Category:Bishops of Lindisfarne Category:7th-century bishops Category:605 births Category:675 deaths Category:7th-century Irish people Category:7th- century Christian saints Category:Medieval Irish saints Category:Northumbrian saints Category:Colombanian saints Category:People from County Galway Category:Irish expatriates in England ","title":"Colmán of Lindisfarne"},{"id":"2234632","text":"Maurice Lewis (Maury) Van Vliet, (August 3, 1913 - April 4, 2001) was a USA- born Canadian academic who taught physical education and fitness.

It is located in San Pedro, Los Angeles, California, at 478 West 6th Street. The design of the Warner Grand Theatre was a collaboration by architect B. Marcus Priteca and interior designer Anthony Heinsbergen, in the Art Deco—Moderne style. It was one of three similarly lavish Los Angeles area Art Deco movie palaces on which Priteca and Heinsbergen collaborated for the Warner Bros. company in the early 1930s. The others were located in Beverly Hills and Huntington Park. Priteca later designed Hollywood's famous Pantages Theatre. The Warner Beverly Hills Theatre has been demolished, and the Huntington Park Warner, closed for many years, has been extensively altered, leaving the Grand as the last of the three original theaters remaining intact. By the mid-1990s it had suffered a lengthy period of neglect, despite having been declared a historical and cultural monument of the city in 1982. Adjusting the sign on the Warner Grand marquis The theater was facing possible demolition or re-development when, in 1995, a local group of activists formed the Grand Vision Foundation to work for the preservation of the historic building. Their efforts were successful when the theater was purchased by the Cultural Affairs Department (later renamed the Department of Cultural Affairs) of the City of Los Angeles in 1996. Efforts to both restore and program the theater have been ongoing since the acquisition. That same year, the Grand Vision Foundation incorporated as a 501(c)(3) charitable corporation, to preserve and promote the Warner Grand Theatre. In 1999, the Warner was added to the National Register of Historic Places as building #98001633. Warner Grand Theatre currently hosts foreign films, art films, and family films presented by Cinema Grand, Grand Vision Foundation, the Los Angeles Harbor International Film Festival, and the San Pedro International Film Festival. Jack L. Warner called it \\"The Castle of Your Dreams\\". The Warner Grand Theatre has also been used as a location in some movies, including Remote Control (1988), What's Love Got to Do with It (1993) and Pearl Harbor (2001). ==See also== * List of Registered Historic Places in Los Angeles * List of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments in the Harbor area ==References== ==External links== *Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs *Official Warner Grand Theatre Website *The Grand Vision Foundation *Flickr Photo set by a volunteer Category:Cinemas and movie theaters in Los Angeles Category:Movie palaces Category:San Pedro, Los Angeles Category:Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments Category:Theatres on the National Register of Historic Places in Los Angeles Category:Theatres completed in 1931 Category:B.

The band calls their music \\"splattercore\\", and their zombie mascot, Martha Splatterhead, appears on most of their albums. Common themes involve social issues and the theme of Martha Splatterhead coming back from the dead to slaughter rapists and child molesters. The band name \\"The ACCUSED\\" is a United States Registered Trademark (#5674245). == History Early years (1981–1992)=== The Accüsed was created in 1981 in Oak Harbor, Washington by bassist Chibon 'Chewy' Batterman; drummer Dana Collins; and guitarist Tommy Niemeyer. John Dahlin was the vocalist from 1982 to 1984. The band's first two demo cassettes and their album, Please Pardon Our Noise, It Is the Sound of Freedom, released in 1983 drew heavily from hardcore punk. In 1984 the Fartz vocalist, Blaine Cook, replaced Dahlin. In 1984 the band began adopting metal into their sound and dubbed their style \\"splatter rock\\", in 'homage' to their favorite genre of horror films. According to a review, \\"Their hybrid musical formula was distinguishable by Cook's unusual choking-sound vocals, Niemeyer's muted, choppy, buzz-saw guitars, dark metallic riffs, and Dana Collins rapid- fire, double-kick drumming.\\" The band also created the zombie mascot, Martha Splatterhead, whose likeness (created by Niemeyer) adorns most of their albums and many of their promotional items. A recurring theme in the band's lyrics involve Martha Splatterhead coming back from the dead to eviscerate and slaughter rapists and child molesters. They released their first full EP, Martha Splatterhead, in 1985 on their own Condar label. Their first full- length LP was The Return of Martha Splatterhead, released on Subcore Records, and later re-released on Earache Records (the first mosh album), in 1986. According to reviewer Jeb Branin, \\"I was writing for a zine in Canada called Northern Metal that reviewed the new LP The Return Of Martha Splatterhead giving it a 0.0 rating and absolutely crucifying it in the review. It is the only 0.0 review I remember ever seeing in Northern Metal. They hated it so much I knew I had to buy it. As I suspected, the album was a masterpiece of hardcore hysteria.\\" The LPs More Fun Than an Open Casket Funeral and Martha Splatterhead's Maddest Stories Ever Told quickly followed, as well a number of other annual releases. Starting with Hymns For the Deranged, the band also began working with Seattle producer Jack Endino, and their next album, Grinning Like An Undertaker, with Josh Sinder now on drums, was released on Nastymix Records followed by the EP \\"Straight Razor\\". The band maintained an active touring schedule, and according to a review, \\"...live, The Accüsed were untouchable ... the whole band was a frenzy of epileptic gyrations, although Blaine's high flying leaps and bouncing off the walls like a deranged gnome were definitely the highlight ... even in today's underground you aren't going to find a more devastating band than The Accüsed.\\" The Accüsed took an 11-year hiatus in 1992, with members taking time to play in other Seattle bands, such as the Fartz and Gruntruck. ===Re-formation (2003–2010 and 2019)=== The Accüsed re-formed in 2003, playing live shows in the Seattle area, and in 2005 released the album Oh, Martha! on the band's CONDAR label. This \\"comeback record\\" landed on Revolver magazine's Top Ten Albums of the Year and writer's lists from Metal Maniacs magazine. Oh, Martha! followed the tradition of many earlier releases by The Accüsed in that it featured a track with a guest lead singer. In this case, guitarist Tommy Niemeyer sang lead vocals on the angry \\"13 Letters\\" (though no lead vocal credit was printed on the album). In 2006 a limited-edition, split 7\\" with Whidbey Island, Washington's punk icons Potbelly was released. The Accüsed 2003 reunion line-up was short-lived, however, as a newly reformed version of the band surfaced in 2006, and yet another incarnation in Summer 2019. In an interview with Rock-A-Rolla, Tom Niemeyer stated that, during one of the band's many line-up changes, Mike Patton (of Mr. Bungle) was approached for the role of vocalist, with Patton ultimately declining Niemeyer's offer due to being \\"totally booked up\\". Patton did suggest Brad Mowen (ASVA, Burning Witch, Mommy, Master Musicians of Bukkake, et al.) who joined The Accüsed in 2006. The 'new' line-up released two new songs, via free download, \\"Scotty Came Back\\" and \\"Fuck Sorry\\", January 26, 2007. In 2009, the band released their sixth full-length album, The Curse of Martha Splatterhead, via Southern Lord Records. The album's first pressing sold-out quickly and received widespread critical praise, forcing Southern Lord Records into a hasty 2nd-pressing of the CD title only weeks after its release. In 2010, the band was included as a part of the soundtrack for Namco Bandai Games' 2010 remake of Splatterhouse. As of April 28, 2019, the Accüsed are, according to founding member and guitarist, Niemeyer, \\"...once again active; with new material slated to be released Summer 2019, as well as a vintage 1983 Live gig from Missoula, Montana coming out on P.I.G. Records in 2019...\\" Niemeyer stated The ACCUSED would also be performing live gigs in select markets accompanying both releases in the summer of 2019. After several line-up changes, the band \\"...have returned with new songs, and releases of older, vintage material–both due out Summer 2019; with select LIVE appearances to follow...\\" according to band founder and guitarist Tommy Niemeyer. Drummer, Josh Sinder, from the Grinning Like An Undertaker and Straight Razor releases, will team up with Niemeyer as the band prepared to move ahead in the years to come. In 2019, a lineup of former members Blaine Cook, Alex Sibbald, Steve Nelson, and Steve McVay joined forces as The Accüsed A.D. They released a music video for \\"Juego Terminado,\\" a song from a forthcoming album.) ==Impact== Despite being frequently cited as an influence by other punk and metal bands, the Accüsed has largely remained in the underground. According to Sputnik Music, \\"It's a shame really [that] The Accüsed aren't recognized in the metal music industry as being one of the pioneering members of crossover thrash. These boys deserve more attention than they get.\\" ==Timeline== ==DiscographyAlbums=== * 1981: Brain Damage 1 (Demo Cassette) * 1982: Brain Damage 2 (Demo Cassette) * 1983: Please Pardon Our Noise, It Is a Sound of Freedom aka Accüsed/Rejectors Split (Fatal Erection) * 1985: Martha Splatterhead (EP, Condar) * 1986: The Return of Martha Splatterhead (LP, Subcore and Earache) * 1987: More Fun Than an Open Casket Funeral (LP, Combat) * 1987: 38 Song Archives Tapes 1981-86 (200 Cassettes Self-Released by The Accüsed) * 1988: Martha Splatterhead's Maddest Stories Ever Told (LP, re- released in 1991 on Combat Records.) * 1988: Hymns for the Deranged (LP, Empty Records) * 1990: Grinning Like an Undertaker (LP, Sub Pop, Nastymix) * 1991: Straight Razor (EP, Nastymix) * 1992: Splatter Rock (LP, Nastymix) * 2006: Oh Martha! + Baked Tapes (Double LP, Nuclear Blast and GmbH) – 666 pressed * 2006: 34 Song Archives Tapes 1981-86 (Condar; #Cond002) * 2007: Why Even Try?

Barrios was a liberal and supported the unity of Central America. He was, from a young age, part of the army of the last president of Federation of Central American Estates, Francisco Morazan. After his death he became the leader or the unionist movement. He served as president of El Salvador several times - in 1858 in acting capacity, from 1859 to 1860 in acting capacity and again from 1860 to 1863. He was known for his concern for international relations and is attributed for introducing coffee production to El Salvador, accelerating the spread through Central America. Coffee became the basis of El Salvador's economy. Between 1860 and 1863, Barrios launched a reorganization of the public finances and promoted the coffee production and silk-elaboration related activities. He also created a professional armed force, and favored non-religious public education. In his first years of government he looked for a pacific convivance with Guatemala, which made him visit that country in 1860. However, conflicts were not absent, especially with the church. One of the first incidents was the expulsion of three Capuchin friars. In 1860, conflicts escalated when the clerk represented by bishop Tomás Pineda y Zaldaña, denied to accept the Constitution on the Republic, claiming that none of the priests were committed to obey the government, because the only authority above all earth is God, the bishop and the Pope. Conservatives felt outraged by Barrios, claiming he was anti-clerical, despotic and liberal. Many conservatives, including bishop Pineda y Zaldaña, had to look for shelter in Guatemala and from there they launched a newspaper campaign against the Salvadoran government. In 1861 attacks were strong, and even worse, a confrontational climate began to grow between the two countries. Particularly because of Guatemala's President aspirations to become the controller of Central America. In 1863, after a few border skirmishes El Salvador declared war on Guatemala, and on June 19 Guatemalan troops began invading El Salvador. On October 26, after a long siege, Carrera took over San Salvador, taking full control of the city. The same year Barrios escaped to San Miguel. With Carrera's approval, Francisco Dueñas installed himself as a president and won the 1865 elections. As a constitutional president, he promoted a trial against Barrios, who was captured in Nicaragua on July 27 and extradited to El Salvador the same week. The court martial began on August 10, and he was sentenced to death on August 28; the execution took place the following day. Statue of Barrios in San Salvador. In 1910 he was officially granted a title of 'national hero' for his heroic efforts to protect the rights of the farming communities as well as leading his military triumphs to protect Central America from foreign invasions. His name has been honored by naming national institutions, two cities (Ciudad Barrios and San Gerardo), and a major street after him, as well as having his life taught at schools. ==References== Category:Presidents of El Salvador Category:Executed presidents Category:1813 births Category:1865 deaths Category:Salvadoran people of Spanish descent Category:Executed Salvadoran people Category:People executed by El Salvador Category:National Liberal Party (El Salvador) politicians Category:Salvadoran military personnel ","title":"Gerardo Barrios"},{"id":"2234649","text":"Santiago González Portillo (25 July 1818 - 1 August 1887) was a general from El Salvador.

Andrés del Valle was a member of the constitutional assembly from 1872 until 1873. In 1874 he became senator for the Santa Ana Department. In 1875, he was vice-chairman of the Senate and chairman of the parliament. On March 1, 1875 the parliament called for elections on the first Sunday of December that year. Andres was elected for the administration between February 1, 1876 and February 1, 1880. His vice-president was the predecessor, Santiago González. A government loan of a half a million USD was enforced on the same day. Justo Rufino Barrios Auyón, then president of Guatemala, was skeptical, because Santiago González supported political refugees from Guatemala. He also suspected Ponciano Leiva from Honduras to be planning to overthrow him. Barrios let Valle know, that in case he planned to continue this course, he would see to it that the Guatemalan government would support José María Medina from Honduras in overthrowing Ponciano Leiva. ==Conference at Volcán Chingo== The government of El Salvador insisted on González's goodwill and a conference at the Volcán Chingo was agreed on, at which, with mediation of Marco Aurelio Soto, an agreement was signed. Barrios was convinced, González remained the actual head of state in El Salvador and insinuated him holding public speeches, as well as committing hypocrisy and treason. ==Guerra de Barrioshttps://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/hubert- howe-bancroft/the-works-of-hubert-howe-bancroft-volume-08-hci/page-42-the- works-of-hubert-howe-bancroft-volume-08-hci.shtml The works of Hubert Howe Bancroft (Volume 08).== Barrios let 1.500 soldiers attack Honduras and led an army himself, which entered Salvador without a declaration of war from the West. On March 20, 1876 the Guatemalan Secretary of War, Jose Maria Samayoa, declared all official relations with El Salvador as terminated, asserted that on March 27, 1876 troops from El Salvador had invaded Guatemala, declared war and gave Barrio absolute power for defending Guatemala's dignity. On March 26, 1876, the government of El Salvador declared the Friendliness- and Support act closed with Guatemala on January 24, 1872 for void. Barrio's plan was to directly attack El Salvador from the West, from Guatemala with one of his armies and, at the same time attack the Departments of San Miguel and La Union from the East, through Honduras. At that time, Mexican General Jose Lopez Uraga was stationed at camp Jutiapa to guard the arsenal there. The troops were unsuccessfully attacking an isolated station on the border from El Salvador, which led Barrios to pass orders to Uraga to move the equipment to Chingo, whilst himself commencing the attack on El Salvador. Barrios held Chalcuapa in garrison. The headquarters of El Salvador was in Santa Ana. Barrios besieged Ahuachapan with approx. 8000 soldiers, Uraga led approx. 1500 soldiers in Chalchuapa and only a handful of soldiers remained in Chingo. The Guatemalan troops holding Apaneca in garrison were forced back. When they tried to return on the morning of April 15, 1875, they involved in combat lasting well into the night until they retreated to Atiquizaya having suffered severe casualties. Between April 17 and 19 1876, General Gregorio Solares had the troops of generals Brioso, Delgado, Sanchez and Espinosa beat and thus controlled the Departments San Miguel an La Union, threatening the Departments San Vincete as well as Usulután and even the official residence of President Valle, cutting off the Salvadorian government from essential resources. Approx. 800 Salvadorian soldiers had been killed and the troops retreated to San Miguel, where only 200 soldiers arrived. Solares had San Miguel and La Union held in garrison. There were enough soldiers to defend Ciudad San Vecente, but the government of El Salvador gave orders for the garrison to troop in the capital. In the West, the army of El Salvador had shrunk to 2600 during the Semana Santa battle in Ahuachapan and nearly 3500 in Santa Ana. After Easter, there were only 900 soldiers left to try to take in Chalchuapa, in vain. During the siege of Atiquizaya, according to the American historian Hubert Howe Bancroft, Barrio had 900 bombs thrown, subsequently marching into Ahuachapan and the following day into Cahlchuapa, where peace talks took place. A peace accord was closed on April 25, 1876 and ratified by the parliaments the following day. This peace was preconditioned by a Conditio- sine-qua-non-formula of a complete replacement of the government of El Salvador. President Valle was forced to resign. ==References== ==External links== * List of El Salvador presidents at worldstatesmen.org Category:Presidents of El Salvador Category:1833 births Category:1888 deaths Category:People from Santa Ana Department Category:Members of the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador Category:19th-century Salvadoran people ","title":"Andrés del Valle"},{"id":"2234655","text":"Rafael Zaldívar Rafael Zaldívar (1834, in San Alejo – 2 March 1903, in Paris) was President of El Salvador from 1 May 1876 until 21 June 1885, and later a diplomat. Zaldívar studied medicine in Europe and began his career as a physician. In 1860 he was appointed to the Chair of Philosophy and Hygiene at the University of Guatemala. After leaving this post, Zaldívar entered politics and was elected to the House of Representatives, then to the Senate, and finally elected president in 1876. It was under his administration that liberal reforms abolished the existence of collectively owned ejidos and tierras comunales throughout the country. He also remains a key figure in what later became known as the \\"Coffee Revolution.\\" It was Rafael Zaldívar who introduced reforms that paved the way for cultivation on large scale. Under the Zaldívar administration, virgin land was turned into farmlands. This was done by allowing for the sale of Indian lands. Resistance resulted from the Indians, but it quelled by the Zaldívar government, mostly by creating and then deploying a rural police force. President Zaldívar was not in favour of the proposed rebirth of the Unified Central Republic agreed to by his predecessors and decided to withdraw from the Union. He was later overthrown in a military coup and succeeded by General Francisco Menéndez. He was appointed as his country's Envoy Extraordnairy and Minister Plenipotentiary to the United Kingdom in early 1900, and later held the same position to France.

Diagonal pliers (or wire cutters or diagonal cutting pliers or diagonal cutters or side cutting pliers) are pliers intended for the cutting of wire (they are generally not used to grab or turn anything). The plane defined by the cutting edges of the jaws intersects the joint rivet at an angle or \\"on a diagonal\\", hence the name. ==Action== Instead of using a shearing action as with scissors, diagonal pliers cut by indenting and wedging the wire apart. The jaw edges are ground to a symmetrical \\"V\\" shape, thus the two jaws can be visualized to form the letter \\"X\\", as seen end-on when fully occluded. The pliers are made of tempered steel, and inductive heating and quenching are often used to selectively harden the jaws. ==Jargon== Diags or dikes (a portmanteau of \\"diagonal cutters\\") is jargon used especially in the US electrical industry, to describe diagonal pliers. \\"Dike\\" can also be used as a verb, such as in the idiom \\"when in doubt, dike it out\\". \\"It is also the term used for hose clamping pliers that crush a hose, shutting off the flow of fluid with a pair of parallel surfaces that come together.\\" In the United Kingdom and Ireland, diagonal pliers are commonly referred to as snips or nippers, and in Canada, Australia and New Zealand they are often referred to as side cutters. ==Insulation== The handles of diagonal cutting pliers are commonly insulated with a dip-type or shrink fit electrically- insulating material for comfort and some protection against electric shock. ==Uses== Diagonal pliers are useful for cutting copper, brass, iron, aluminium and steel wire. Lower quality versions are generally not suitable for cutting tempered steel, such as piano wire, as the jaws are not hard enough. Attempting to cut such material will usually cause indentations to be made in the jaws, or a piece to break out of one or both jaws, thus ruining the tool. However higher quality side cutters can cut hardened steel, such as 2 mm piano wire. ==Variations== For electronics work, special diagonal cutters that are ground flush to the apex of the cutting edge on one side of the jaws are often used. These flush-cutting pliers allow wires to be trimmed flush or nearly flush to a solder joint, avoiding the sharp tip left by symmetrical diagonal cutters. It is common for this type of diagonal cutter to be referred to by another name, such as \\"flush cutter\\" to distinguish it from symmetrical cutters. Light duty flush cutting wire cutters with offcut retaining finger. Compound action wire cutters. For easier cutting of larger gauge wire, a compound-action can be employed to increase the mechanical advantage.

Jones was drafted out of Albany State College by the Philadelphia 76ers with the 14th pick in the 1973 NBA draft. He played three seasons in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and 14 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA), most extensively with the 76ers. Jones led the ABA in blocked shots in the 1973–74 season, and played in the 1975 ABA All-Star Game. He shares (with Julius Keye) the ABA's all-time record for blocked shots in a game with 12. Jones' brothers, Charles, Wil and Major all played at Albany State and in the NBA. The most prominent of the foursome, Caldwell, was best known as the least flamboyant member of the high-powered 76ers teams of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Playing alongside Julius Erving and company, Jones did not need to score much with Philadelphia, so he concentrated on rebounding, shotblocking, and defense. A lanky yet strong pivotman, his hustle, board work, and defense kept him in professional basketball for 17 years. Playing in his final season at the age of 39, he was the fifth-oldest NBA player ever to have suited up at the time. He finished with 10,241 points (in the NBA and ABA), but it had taken him 1,299 games to rack them up. No other player who scored 10,000 points had ever needed more than 1,200 games to do so. ==Playing career== Jones began his career in 1973–74 with the ABA's San Diego Conquistadors, coached by Wilt Chamberlain. During three ABA seasons (including short stints with the Kentucky Colonels and the Spirits of St. Louis), Jones averaged 15.8 points, hitting a career high of 19.5 points per game in 1974–75. \\"I was a gunner\\", he later told the Dallas Morning News. \\"Every time I caught the ball I shot it.\\" With the ABA–NBA merger prior to the 1976–77 season, Jones landed with Philadelphia. His days as a scorer were over. \\"We had so much talent on those 76ers teams that [Coach] Gene Shue said all he wanted his centers to do was play defense and rebound. I had no argument with that\\", Jones later told the Portland Oregonian...\\"We were winning and that's the name of the game. And it's kept me around for 16 years.\\" In Jones' first season with Philadelphia, the team was particularly explosive. Erving (21.6 point per game), George McGinnis (21.4 pointe per game), Doug Collins (18.3 points per game), and Lloyd B. Free (later World B. Free) (16.3 points per game) propelled the squad to a 50–32 regular season record and an 1977 NBA Finals meeting with the Portland Trail Blazers. Jumping out to a two-game lead, the 76ers appeared to be headed for the title, but the Trail Blazers rallied for a dramatic 4–2 Finals win. For the season, Jones averaged 6.0 points and 8.1 rebounds and finished sixth on the team in minutes played. He also ranked fifth in the league in blocked shots with 200. Philadelphia won the Atlantic Division again in 1977–78 but lost to the Washington Bullets in the Eastern Conference Finals. Jones averaged 5.4 points (ninth on the team) and 7.0 rebounds (third). That season marked the emergence of Darryl Dawkins, with whom Jones shared minutes in the pivot during the following seasons. In 1978–79 the 76ers slipped a bit, finishing second in the Atlantic Division to Washington and losing to the San Antonio Spurs in the conference semifinals. Jones averaged 9.3 points (his highest average at Philadelphia) and 9.6 rebounds and was ninth in the league in blocks with 157. The 76ers reached the 1980 NBA Finals. Erving scored 26.9 points per game in the season, and Jones was a defensive force, pulling down 11.9 rebounds per game, fourth in the league, and blocking 162 shots, seventh in the league. Although Philadelphia finished behind the Boston Celtics in the regular season, the 76ers tore through the playoffs before coming up short against the Los Angeles Lakers in the Finals. Jones and teammate Bobby Jones (no relation) were NBA All-Defensive First Team selections for the next two seasons, and the 76ers made another trip to the NBA Finals and battled the Lakers in 1982. Philadelphia again fell in six games. After the season, the 76ers sent Jones to the Houston Rockets in a deal that brought Moses Malone to Philadelphia. The 76ers won the championship the following season. Jones played two seasons in Houston (joining his brother Major on the Rockets' squad), one in Chicago, four in Portland, and one in San Antonio. Primarily he was a reserve, called upon to spell the starting center, grab some rebounds, and play some defense. \\"I'm like a spare tire on the Cadillac\\", he told USA Today in the twilight of his career. \\"I'm just sitting around in the trunk, waiting to get put on the car if one of the fancy tires blows out\\". \\"Everybody likes to look at the glorified part of the game, like scoring points\\", Jones told USA Today in 1990. \\"But there is a lot more to the game. I look at myself like an offensive lineman. Someone has to open the holes for the 1,000-yard rushers.\\" \\"What do I think of Caldwell Jones? When he retires, I think they should have a farewell tour for him\\", Larry Brown, Jones's coach with the San Antonio Spurs, told USA Today. ==Personal life== Jones grew up in McGehee, Arkansas, a member of a very tall family. The Caldwell Jones, Sr., and his wife, Cecelia, had eight children. Their shortest child was Clovis, the only daughter, who grew to . Four of the Jones' boys played in the NBA: Wilbert (, one season each with the Indiana Pacers and the Buffalo Braves, plus seven seasons with three ABA teams), Caldwell (five NBA and three ABA teams), Major (, five seasons with the Houston Rockets, one with the Detroit Pistons), and Charles (, 15 seasons total with Philadelphia, the Chicago Bulls, the Washington Bullets, the Detroit Pistons and the Houston Rockets). Two other brothers played minor league basketball. In the 37 NBA seasons accumulated by the four Jones' brothers, only once did a Jones post a scoring average in double figures—Wilbert did it in the 1976–77 season with the Pacers, tallying 13.0 points per game. However, between them the brothers had several double- figure scoring seasons in the ABA. Oliver was the first of the Jones' brothers to play basketball at Albany State and later became head coach for 28 years at the school. Five other brothers, including Caldwell, followed. For 18 straight seasons, a Jones occupied the center position for the Albany basketball team. Caldwell distinguished himself the most as a professional out of all brothers. Jones died of a heart attack while at a driving range near his home in Stockbridge, Georgia on September 21, 2014. He was 64 years old. \\"Caldwell had never been much of a golfer\\", his wife Vanessa said. \\"He’d discovered the game late in life. But you know, he wrote that he would play golf if that’s the only thing he could do. That’s what he would do every day for the rest of his life\\". \\"Too sudden\\", Vanessa said, \\"he was fine in church and at brunch. Just a normal day. No reason to think anything was up. I miss him so much\\". ==See also== * List of National Basketball Association career blocks leaders * List of National Basketball Association career playoff blocks leaders ==References== ==External links== Category:1950 births Category:2014 deaths Category:African-American basketball players Category:Albany State Golden Rams men's basketball players Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players from Arkansas Category:Centers (basketball) Category:Chicago Bulls players Category:Houston Rockets players Category:Kentucky Colonels players Category:People from McGehee, Arkansas Category:Philadelphia 76ers draft picks Category:Philadelphia 76ers players Category:Portland Trail Blazers assistant coaches Category:Portland Trail Blazers players Category:Power forwards (basketball) Category:San Antonio Spurs players Category:San Diego Conquistadors players Category:San Diego Sails players Category:Spirits of St. Louis players ","title":"Caldwell Jones"},{"id":"2234678","text":"General Tomás Herculano de Jesús Regalado Romero (November 7, 1861 in Santa Ana, El Salvador – July 11, 1906 in Jutiapa, Guatemala) was President of El Salvador from 14 November 1898 until 1 March 1903. He was a military ruler and gained power by deposing Rafael Antonio Gutiérrez, a man he had previously helped achieve control of the country by taking part in a conspiracy to oust Carlos Ezeta four years earlier. Elected to a four-year term in 1899, he promoted the construction of railways, declared an amnesty for political exiles, and began the construction of the beautiful Santa Ana Theater. Upon leaving office, he remained active in the Army of El Salvador and was appointed Minister of War by his handpicked successor Pedro José Escalón. During a war against Guatemala in 1906 he led a Salvadoran invasion force and went into battle. Seriously wounded, he soon died on the 11th of June . His coup d'état led to the dissolution of the Greater Republic of Central America after his government withdrew from it.Walker, Thomas W. Nicaragua, the Land of Sandino. Boulder: Westview Press, 1981., p. 17. Regalado was the last in a series of presidents who had come to power by force during the 19th Century. His peaceful transfer of power to Pedro José Escalón in 1903 allowed for a degree of political stability that persisted until the events of 1931-32. ==References== Category:Presidents of El Salvador Category:1861 births Category:1906 deaths Category:People from Santa Ana, El Salvador Category:Leaders who took power by coup Category:Defence ministers of El Salvador Category:Salvadoran military personnel ","title":"Tomás Regalado (Salvadoran politician)"},{"id":"2234679","text":"The Internet Adult Film Database (IAFD) is an online database of information pertaining to, in United States, the pornography industry: actors, actresses, directors, studios, distributors and pornographic films. ==History== The predecessor to IAFD was email- and FTP-accessible database of adult film actresses called Abserver that had been created by Dan Abend in 1993. IAFD itself was started by Peter van Aarle, who had collected data on adult movies since 1981, when he began keeping notes on index cards on adult movies he had seen or were reviewed in Adam Film World. In 1993, he began contributing to the Usenet newsgroup alt.sex.movies, where he met Dan Abend. The two exchanged databases and began work on a WWW-based database. Van Aarle later collaborated on this Web database with Ron Wilhelm, who went by the pseudonym of \\"Heretic\\". The first version of the IAFD was brought on-line in 1995 by the programming efforts of Wilhelm, who used the project as a training ground for SGML programming which he was learning in college. After Wilhelm left the Internet to join the military, the site eventually fell victim to link rot. In the fall of 1998, Van Aarle was at a trade show with Jeff Vanzetti, who asked if Van Aarle would be interested in resurrecting the IAFD — this time under its own domain. Vanzetti was looking for a project on which to teach himself on-line database programming using SQL Server, and this seemed like a natural fit, since they were both co-moderators of the newsgroup rec.arts.movies.erotica (RAME), and members of the newsgroup would often lament about the passing of the original Internet Adult Film Database. The beginning of 1999 brought the first steps towards the relaunch of the IAFD. Initially, search boxes only searched females, and data was restricted to movies released post-1989. Van Aarle said on this: > In those early days of the IAFD I had made one stipulation: I did not want > the movie info on movies before 1989 to be available. The idea behind this > was basically that if I would ever decide I wanted to do something > commercially with my database it would be a good idea to keep the most > valuable parts of it off limits. The data on older titles was clearly the > most difficult to compile (and very few people I ever talked to had much > info on the older stuff, with a few notable exceptions like Jim Holliday), > and therefore the more valuable part of the data. The cut-off date of 1989 > was a compromise to include at least the titles of Buttman, who was one of > the most popular directors of the time. Van Aarle died on September 18, 2005 at the age of 42 from a heart attack. In 2011, he was inducted into the XRCO Hall of Fame. On March 1, 2007, the IAFD rolled out information on over 18,000 gay titles and some 39,000 gay performers. Like the IMDb, forms are used for submitting data corrections, though the IAFD's form is considerably simpler than the IMDb's. However, neither IMDb or IAFD corrections are immediate; thus both correction services are fairly equal. According to the site, it contains entries on over 119,453 titles and 111,498 persons (both actors and directors). According to Vanzetti, IAFD adds about 500 new titles a month and processes thousands of corrections—corrections that anyone can submit for review. IAFD has a \\"team of editors\\" that exercises editorial control over what's posted on the site: \\"If it's submitted by a fan of the performer and the working editor trusts the submitter, it gets listed. If it's published by someone else, it might get added—we are skeptical of user generated sites since anyone can submit anything to them regardless of accuracy and then it becomes 'fact'. Otherwise, no data.\\" IAFD's policy on releasing real names of adult film performers is: \\"The exception to this rule is when it comes to real names. We're not interested in linking your real name to your porn name, so if your real name appears on the site, we will remove it (assuming we know what your real name is). However, if your real name appeared on a boxcover due to a mix up in the Art Department, there's little we can do about that.\\" IAFD gets \\"paid by sponsors for ad banners\\", and they \\"get an affiliate commission from products purchased\\" via the site. ==Review and research== The site has been used as a reference by a variety of outlets that include newspaper articles, books, and research studies. The academic and non-academic writing community has also used the site's information to varying degrees. In 2011, the site released a report of compiled data for the year. Included in the statistics released were the number of new titles added that year (9,384) and a ranking of who the busiest performers were. The report also included site data, such as that it was visited by 20.7 million unique viewers and that visitors to the site viewed nearly a quarter of a billion pages. An editor at AVN magazine stated: \\"[it] underscores the fact that a lot of people not only like porn but want to research information about movies and performers.\\" ===Media outlets=== On October 1, 2007, an article about the Internet Adult Film Database appeared in the online equivalent of the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S. Paulo. Considered the \\"Internet Movie Database\\" of the adult entertainment world\\", the site is also routinely quoted or referenced by the majority of the industry trade publications, such as Adult Video News (AVN) and XBIZ. ===Deep Inside: A Study of 10,000 Porn Stars=== On February 14, 2013, a study was released by freelance journalist Jon Millward that sampled the data from 10,000 actors (7,000 women and 3,000 men) from the site to, among other things, compile a profile of the \\"average porn star\\" as well as generate some statistics about adult industry actors based on IAFD data. The study was written about several days later on Playboy.com. It showed that the typical female porn star was a five-foot-five-inch brunette with B-cup breasts. The survey was started in 2011, with the researcher's first visit to IAFD.com, with the bulk of Millward's research taking place in the six months prior to the release of the study. For comparative results, the study also cites Center for Disease Control and U.S. Census statistics as well as information from a Stanford University linguistics professor. The survey covers roughly a 40-year span of the adult industry and presents statistics on categories such as age, race, state of origin, chosen screen name, biological data (height, weight, hair color, etc.), and the type of sexual acts performed over an actor's career. ==See also== * Adult Film ==References== == External links == * * \\"Remembering Peter Van Aarle\\", IAFD.com, September 21, 2005. * Category:American erotica and pornography websites Adult Film Database Category:Works about pornography ","title":"Internet Adult Film Database"},{"id":"2234681","text":"Pedro José Escalón (March 25, 1847 - September 6, 1923) was born in Santa Ana, El Salvador.

Escalón's presidency was paved by General Tomas Regalado who, in 1903, after gaining and centralizing power, transferred power to him. Escalón's presidency also marked the beginning of democracy in the country. It was from his term in office that the law of every president being allowed a maximum of four years in office was put into effect. ==References== Category:Presidents of El Salvador Category:1847 births Category:1923 deaths Category:People from Santa Ana, El Salvador Category:Salvadoran military personnel ","title":"Pedro José Escalón"},{"id":"2234683","text":"General Fernando Figueroa (4 March 1849 - 16 June 1919) was president of El Salvador from 1 March 1907 to 1 March 1911.\\"El Salvador\\".

His family were wealthy landowners who cultivated coffee; his father was of Basque and his mother of Portuguese descent. As a young man he studied medicine at the University of El Salvador, and after earning his doctorate in 1891 at age 26, he went to Europe to continue his studies specializing in surgery. ==Presidency== Araujo served as the Vice President of Fernando Figueroa from March 1907 to March 1911. At age forty-five, Dr. Araujo stood as an official candidate for national president in the election of November 1910, and won the office with the support of outgoing president Fernando Figueroa. During his presidency, the Army received special attention and increased funding; consequently, many foreign military advisors were hired to educate and train Salvadoran officers. In 1912, Araujo founded the National Guard as a rural police force for the country. Former officers of the Spanish Civil Guard were recruited to train them and to provide men for his private security corps. In a reorganization of the national judicial system, offices of Justices of the Peace were established in all the country's municipalities to ensure the rule of law throughout the nation. A Ministry of Agriculture was formed to promote the cultivation of coffee. In 1911, the Teatro Nacional (National Theatre) was built in San Salvador, and the centenary of the independence uprising of 1811 was celebrated with the inauguration of the Monumento a los Próceres de 1811 (Monument to the Heroes of 1811) in Plaza Libertad (Freedom Park) to memorialize the heroes of the movement. The current national flag and the coat of arms it contains were adopted in 1912. ==Death== On 9 February 1913, during a concert in the San Salvador Bolivar Park (now Plaza Gerardo Barrios), President Araujo was severely wounded when farmers Mulatilo Virgilio, Fermin Perez and Fabian Graciano assaulted him with machetes. Araujo died five days later and was buried in one of El Salvador's famous cemeteries. The motives of the attackers, who were executed after a military trial, were never thoroughly investigated. ==References== Category:1865 births Category:1913 deaths Category:People from Usulután Department Category:Presidents of El Salvador Category:Vice Presidents of El Salvador Category:Salvadoran people of Basque descent Category:Salvadoran people of Portuguese descent Category:Salvadoran surgeons Category:Deaths by blade weapons Category:People murdered in El Salvador Category:Assassinated Salvadoran politicians Category:1913 crimes in El Salvador Category:1913 murders in North America Category:1910s murders in El Salvador ","title":"Manuel Enrique Araujo"},{"id":"2234691","text":"In Italy, Pro Loco (the term is both singular and plural) are grass-roots organizations that seek to promote some particular place, almost always a town and its immediate area; pro loco is a Latin phrase that may be roughly translated \\"in favor of the place\\". Usually the town is a full-fledged comune, but not always: frazioni and other small places with a high level of civic pride may have their own Pro Loco. Very often, the name of a Pro Loco is just \\"Pro Loco N\\", where N is the name of the town; not infrequently, though, one meets with the simpler \\"Pro N\\", where N may be the name of the town or even its ancient Roman name. The Pro Loco is a volunteer, grass-roots organization, and must not be confused with such publicly financed organizations as the Azienda di Promozione Turistica (APT) or the Ufficio di Informazione e Accoglienza Turistica (IAT), the aim of which is to promote tourism. Still, Pro Loco could have a legal identity as a no-profit organization if part of the UNPLI, Unione Nazionale Pro Loco d'Italia, the National Union: Pro Loco with a statute in line with UNPLI's protocols could have legal advice and some fiscal advantages, mostly a reduced fare in paying the (quite expensive) rights to SIAE to play music or theatre in public places. In most Italian towns, the Pro Loco's main purpose is to organize, finance, advertise, and operate the local Sagra or palio; it is thus quintessentially at the service of residents rather than visitors. In some places though, a wider purpose has been taken on, that of promoting the town's products or tourism; and in some few cases, a very active and socially conscious Pro Loco will sponsor publications, scholarly research, or the restoration of local monuments. ==References== Category:Organisations based in Italy ","title":"Pro Loco"},{"id":"2234698","text":"Sungenis is a family name of Italian origin, originally spelled San Genisi, in reference to Saint Genesius of Rome.

Because of the abundant variety of this part of the Velebit range, the area was upgraded from a nature reserve in 1999, and opened as a national park in September the same year. The whole of the Velebit range is a \\"nature park\\", a lesser conservation category. Another national park on Velebit is the Paklenica on its southern side. ==The park== The park reserve is protected and visitors are restricted to designated trails. Inside the reserve is the Visibaba (Galanthus) botanical reserve, with an abundance of the endemic Croatian subspecies of Sibiraea altaiensis, and the Zavižan–Balinovac–Velika kosa botanical reserve, famous for its outstanding collection of mountain flora species. Inside the reserve is the well-known Velebit Botany Garden, founded by pharmacology professor and botanist Fran Kušan in 1967. The Park is criss-crossed with mountaineering trails. The best- known is Premužić's Trail, named after its constructor, the forester Ante Premužić who built it in late 1933. The path runs through the most beautiful and most interesting parts of the park. From the numerous peaks in the surroundings there are magnificent views of the Adriatic Sea and its islands (Pag, Rab, Goli Otok, Prvić and Krk) as well as of the continental side. Park map Adding to the Park's cultural value are the numerous ruins of so-called \\"summer lodges\\". These remain from when Velebit was populated by shepherds and cattle farmers. On its coastal slopes are many ruined houses, lodges and stone walls, all the remaining evidence of a lost local population. The Zavižan (1676 m) peak is within the park, the highest meteorological station in Croatia. ==Special reservations== The special reservations in the park are two locales called Hajdučki kukovi and Rožanski kukovi. Their names come from a folk name given to large stone masses which rise up over the surroundings of the Velebit mountains. They are in the center of the park, but are not a regular part of it, access to them is restricted to scientific researchers and educational visitors. ===Hajdučki kukovi=== Hajdučki kukovi is one of the Kukovi group of peaks in the northern part of the Velebit. Together with Rožanski kukovi it forms an area of around 22 km2 declared as a nature reserve in 1969. It is separated from Rožanski kukovi by the Skrbina Draga and Veliki Lubenovac field. The kukovi group has around 40 summits exceeding 1600 m. The area around Hajdučki kukovi has a complex underground drainage system. The terrain is much wilder than around Rožanski kukovi, and there are parts where even today no human foot has ever trod.Radovan Radovinović, The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide, pg. 143, Naklada Naprijed - Zagreb (1999), Lukina jama, the deepest mountain cave in Croatia and one of the deepest in southeast Europe, with a depth of 1392 m, was discovered in 1992 by a local caving enthusiast named Ozren Lukić.

The centre of the rocks begin immediately behind Rossijeva koliba (a mountain hut), also 2.5 hours' walk from the hostel. The most interesting part of this rocky region is on the path from Rossilijeva koliba to Crikvena (1641 m), half an hour's walk from the hut. In an area of about 18 km2 there are more than fifty stony peaks, all over 1600 m, some with bizarre shapes of towers, spires or obelisks. Here all the phenomena of karst rock meet – chasms, dizzying heights, crevices, caves, natural gateways and passes.

The toys are identified by their characteristic wrinkled faces and clothing. They were based on the hound breed of dog. The original design was created by Senitt Puppets, based in Carnarvon, Ontario. Catherine Senitt designed and sold handmade puppets for over twenty years throughout the United States and Canada.Trunkit, the Wrinkles elephant The dogs were made in three sizes. Most common are the medium-sized toys, which are about 18 inches (46 cm) high, and are the most anthropomorphic, as they were designed to sit upright. They are dressed in jogging suits, in overalls and a T-shirt, or in dresses, and have openings to allow them to double as hand puppets. There are also smaller, nine-inch-high (23 cm) toys, who sit on four legs and wear bonnets and booties, and larger toys, which are over 2 feet (61 cm) tall. Other Wrinkles animals were also manufactured, including a moose named Moogums (or Moogy), and an elephant named Trunkit. As proof of authenticity, all Wrinkles toys have a bone-shaped symbol embroidered into their ear. As well, they all came with a fabric bone. The plush Wrinkles spawned some additional merchandise, including metal dinner trays, PVC figures, poseable dolls and even a direct to video movie featuring child actress Amy Foster. The Wrinkles TV advertisement which aired during the 1980s featured the Wrinkles talking and chatting to the camera and finished with the dog looking to the screen and exclaiming \\"Hi, I'm Wrinkles, I've got my name under my ear!\\", at which point it flicked its little plush head to one side, lifting its ear to reveal the bone-shaped symbol under the ear. Wrinkles have been sold as part of Ganz's \\"Heritage Collection\\", though the line appears to have been discontinued. Wrinkles dogs are fairly common fare on eBay and other auction sites selling toys. They can also still be purchased from the original designers at Senitt Puppets. == References == ==External links== *Ganzbros Wrinkles (Yahoo Group, archived on October 22, 2012) *WrinklesClub.com (archived on February 5, 2005) Category:Stuffed toys Category:Toy animals Category:1980s toys ","title":"Wrinkles (toy)"},{"id":"2234735","text":"Emperor Tomato Ketchup is the fourth studio album by English-French rock band Stereolab. It was released on 18 March 1996 in the United Kingdom by Duophonic Records and on 9 April 1996 in the United States by Elektra Records. The album takes its name from the 1971 experimental film Tomato Kecchappu Kōtei (Emperor Tomato Ketchup) by Japanese author and director Shūji Terayama, whilst the artwork is inspired by the sleeve of a 1964 recording of composer Béla Bartók's Concerto for Orchestra by the Bamberg Symphony conducted by Heinrich Hollreiser. Two singles were released from Emperor Tomato Ketchup: \\"Cybele's Reverie\\" and \\"Metronomic Underground\\". A video was released for \\"The Noise of Carpet\\". ==Composition== Emperor Tomato Ketchup saw Stereolab experiment with building tracks around looped sounds instead of traditional riffs. Critic Tom Moon wrote that on the album, loops are overlaid together into \\"richly textured collages\\" in a fashion similar to hip hop and electronica music. ==Reception== Emperor Tomato Ketchup was released to positive reception, becoming the band's most commercially and critically successful album to date. By August 1997, the album had sold over 46,000 units in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. ==Legacy== Emperor Tomato Ketchup has appeared in numerous lists of the greatest albums. Spin named it the 46th best album of the 1990s. It was ranked 51st on Pitchforks list of the decade's best albums, with site writer Brent DiCrescenzo praising it as Stereolab's \\"most definitive and recommended statement\\" and recalling that it \\"sounded wholly futuristic and alien\\" at the time of its release. Tom Moon included Emperor Tomato Ketchup in his book 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die (2008), and it was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits for Emperor Tomato Ketchup adapted from album liner notes.

Molina was one of the founders of the Democratic Party of El Salvador. His policies largely served the interests of the coffee oligarchy of the country. In 1918, Molina established the Lega Rojas, or the Red league,which intended to work as a mediator between the oligarchy and the peasants. It was deemed as the first attempt to form an official party in the country.https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs- transcripts-and-maps/quinones-molina-alfonso-1873-1950 However, the far- reaching oligarchic control of the prevented the organization from achieving its goal. Later it supported the candidacy of President Jorge Melendez. After becoming president in 1923, Molina ruled El Salvador like a ruthless dictator,harassing and suppressing any form of opposition. It was common among Salvadoran presidents to declare an heir during the final days of their terms, as the constitution barred immediate re-election. Molina handed the presidency to Vice-president Romero. He thought that as Romero did not spring from a rich family, he would be a puppet of Molina. However, Molina's plan backfired,and he,along with other members of the dynasty organized a coup against the new president. But, the coup, which took place in December 1927, ultimately failed.https://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/q/quinones_molina.htm Molina's decision to borrow money from other countries to pave the roads of San Salvador sparked controversy in the country, and this controversy was exploited by subsequent rulers, like Maximiliano Hernández Martinez. ==References== Category:1874 births Category:1950 deaths Category:People from Cuscatlán Department Category:Presidents of El Salvador Category:Vice Presidents of El Salvador ","title":"Alfonso Quiñónez Molina"},{"id":"2234746","text":"Jorge Meléndez Ramírez (April 15, 1871 - November 22, 1953), was born to Rafael Meléndez and Mercedes Ramírez (daughter of Norberto Ramírez).

An agricultural leader and engineer, Araujo had been elected in what is generally reckoned as the country's first honest presidential contest.The New York Times of December 4, 1931 Arturo Araujo was a distant relative of Manuel Enrique Araujo. Pachita Tennant Mejía de Pike, who is familiar with the history of Salvadoran families, says that the Araujo family mostly comes from the town of Jucuapa, in the department of Usulután, El Salvador. However, Arturo Araujo's family originally came from Suchitoto, in the department of Cuscatlán, moving to Santa Tecla around 1885. His parents were Enriqueta Fajardo de Araujo and Dr. Eugenio Araujo, Finance Minister in the Administration of General Francisco Menéndez.Arturo Araujo He spent some time studying in Liverpool, England. It was there that Araujo became involved with Labour Party politics. He also met his English wife, Dora née Morton, while a student there.White, Alastair El Salvador London 1973 p.98 ==Biography== Araujo was a member of land-owning oligarchy of El Salvador. He made an unsuccessful bid for presidency in 1919. Before that, his speech at the first workers congress in the western town of Armenia earned him the nickname \\"Benefactor of the general people.\\" In 1922, he made a failed attempt to invade the country from Honduras. The free elections in 1931 failed to obtain a plurality for any of the candidate. Arturo won the elections with the backing of his supporters in the congress. Alberto Masferrer had proposed a nine-point reform program of the country, based on which the president promised food, cloth, work and housing to every Salvadoran. However, Government corruption and the Great Depression created disadvantage for the president. Soon he was overthrown in a military coup, and with his overthrow began five decades of military rule in the country.https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs- transcripts-and-maps/araujo-arturo-1878-1967 ==Notes== Category:1878 births Category:1967 deaths Category:People from La Libertad Department (El Salvador) Category:Presidents of El Salvador Category:Leaders ousted by a coup ","title":"Arturo Araujo"},{"id":"2234756","text":"Brigadier General Andrés Ignacio Menéndez (1 February 1879-7 June 1962) was born in Santa Ana, El Salvador.

The Supreme Court declared his term unconstitutional, even the United States did not recognize his coming to power, which deemed his regime pro- fascist.https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs- transcripts-and-maps/aguirre-y-salinas-osmin-1889-1977 == Personal Life == Osmín Aguirre y Salinas was born in San Miguel, San Miguel, on December 24, 1889. He married Mrs. Rosa Cardona and fathered four children. == Government of Hernández Martínez == Civic Directory of El Salvador. Osmín Aguirre y Salinas is the 5th from the right. On December 2, 1931, President Arturo Araujo was overthrown by Army officers over anger that they had not been paid. Colonel Osmín Aguirre y Salinas took part in the coup and helped establish the Civic Directory. The Civic Directory handed over the Presidency of El Salvador to then Vice President General Maximiliano Hernández Martínez on December 4. Aguirre y Salinas acted as Director of the National Police during Hernández Martínez's presidency from 1931 through 1944. In January 1932, peasants across western El Salvador took up arms against the government after legislative elections were cancelled by President Hernández Martínez.Lungo Uclés, Mario (1996) El Salvador in the eighties: counterinsurgency and revolution Philadelphia: Temple University Press, p 114Nohlen, D (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I, p 277 In what would become a massacre of 25,000 to 40,000 indigenous and communists, Aguirre y Salinas was put in charge of capturing Farabundo Martí, one of the rebellion's communist leaders. == Presidency == Osmín Aguirre y Salinas. On May 9, 1944, Maximiliano Hernández Martínez resigned due to an attempted coup, strikes being conducted against his government, and pressure from the United States.A Force More Powerful: A Century of Non-violent Conflict, by Peter Ackerman and Jack DuVall, St. Martin's Press, 2015, pages 256-263A Force More Powerful: A Century of Non-violent Conflict, by Peter Ackerman and Jack DuVall, St. Martin's Press, 2015, pages 256-263 After Hernández Martínez's resignation, Andrés Ignacio Menéndez became Provisional President of El Salvador. On October 21, 1944, Aguirre y Salinas and other military officers who previously supported Hernández Martínez overthrew Andrés Ignacio Menéndez's government and established himself as Provisional President of El Salvador. He cracked down on political opposition which lead to an armed uprising being launched by students in San Salvador on December 8, followed by an insurgent attack from Guatemala four days later where dictator Jorge Ubico had been overthrown in July. Both movements were crushed by the Aguirre y Salinas government, which thus consolidated its position in power. During his brief and short presidency, he issued a decree reforming the regulations of executive power on February 28, 1945, with the purpose of making a \\"more rational distribution of the different branches of public administration\\" and considering \\"urgent the introduction of some reforms to the Regulation of the Executive Power, so that the incoming Government can organize said services on new bases.\\" In January 1945, Aguirre y Salinas oversaw the presidential elections and ran in them to be elected to a second term. The election was boycotted by five candidates who withdrew after accusing Osmín Aguirre y Salinas of unfair election practices to ensure victory for his favored candidate.Parker, Franklin D (1981) The Central American republics Westport: Greenwood Press, p152 The election ended in a victory for Salvador Castaneda Castro of the Social Democratic Unification Party with 312,754 votes and a margin of 99.70%.Nohlen, D (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook Vol. 1 Oxford University Press, p287 Aguirre y Salinas himself only received 690 votes, a margin of 0.22%, in the heavily rigged election.

He had previously served as Interior Minister under President Maximiliano Hernández Martínez. He was elected unopposed during martial law in January 1945, and was overthrown in a coup by other military officers in December 1948. ==1944 Salvadoran uprisings== A general strike had begun on 19 April 1944 in reaction to the repressive policies of the President Maximiliano Hernández Martínez, which included acts of civil disobedience by workers, students, and government employees, who refused to attend work or school during the strike. During the strike a member of the police killed the son of a wealthy United States immigrant. The US ambassador demanded an explanation, and the struggling economy also contributed to the pressure on Hernández Martínez, who resigned. Before leaving for exile, Hernández Martínez appointed General Andrés Ignacio Menéndez as provisional president. Although the strike succeeded in ousting Hernández Martínez, its leaders were not organized well enough to form an enduring organization. Hernández Martínez' supporters also succeeded in arresting or exiling many of the leaders of the strike. In October 1944, Osmín Aguirre y Salinas, who had been the director of the National Police, staged a counter-coup along with many other very conservative military officials. He promptly repressed most dissident groups. This repression radicalized the oppression, which armed itself in neighboring Guatemala, which had just overthrown its dictator Jorge Ubico during the Guatemalan Revolution. An armed uprising was launched by students in San Salvador on 8 December, followed by an insurgent attack from Guatemala four days later. Both movements were crushed by the Aguirre government, which thus consolidated its position in power. ==Presidency== In early 1945, Aguirre transferred power to Castaneda Castro. In January 1945, Castaneda Castro was elected president, with the backing of the elites that had supported Hernández Martínez. He contested the election as a candidate of Partido Agraria, or the Agrarian Party. He faced no opposition in the election, and the country remained under martial law during the entire process. Castaneda Castro had previously served as the interior minister in the government of Hernández Martínez, as had many of the ministers that Castaneda Castro appointed. The Castaneda Castro government passed a measure that loosened the restrictions on labor unions in January 1946. However, the government did not liberalize its response to strikes; In October 1946, workers from a bakers union and a textile factory led a general strike in the hope of ousting Castaneda Castro from the presidency. The strike was put down by the government, and two hundred workers were arrested. In September 1946, in response to a further strike, Castaneda Castro disbanded all the labor organizations and exiled their leaders. The situation in the country during Castro's government has been described by historian Paul Almeida as a \\"state of siege. R.V. Elam stated that the governments of Aguirre and Castaneda Castro \\"reestablished elitist rule, [and] restricted political activity.\\" James Dunkerley has stated that during Castaneda Castro's government, the country saw an economic recovery as the price of coffee rose, even as a return to democracy became less likely as the cold war strengthened anti-communist sentiment. In 1945 Castaneda Castro met Guatemalan President Juan Jose Arevalo to discuss the possibility of a Central American Union. In 1946, the two presidents signed the Pact of Santa Ana, and a year afterward they signed the Pact of the Confederate Union of the Central American States. However, this project was never fully realized. Castro was deposed in a coup in December 1948. The coup was led by many younger military officers. ==References== Category:1888 births Category:1965 deaths Category:People from Santa Ana Department Category:Salvadoran people of Spanish descent Category:Presidents of El Salvador Category:World War II political leaders Category:Leaders ousted by a coup Category:Salvadoran military personnel ","title":"Salvador Castaneda Castro"},{"id":"2234771","text":"Óscar Osorio Hernández (December 14, 1910 - March 6, 1969) ruled as a member of the Revolutionary Council of Government from December 14, 1948 to September 14, 1950. He was President of El Salvador from September 14, 1950 until September 14, 1956. ==Biography== Osorio was born in the town of Sonsonate, El Salvador, on December 14, 1910. El coronel Oscar Osorio asume la Presidencia de el Salvador en 1950 He married twice: first with Leticia Rosales, with whom she had three children: Ana Maya, Rhina and Oscar. His second wife was Esperanza Llerena and had two children, Cecilia and Humberto. His primary education was made in Sonsonate, Santa Ana and San Salvador, and worked in the Military School Captain General Gerardo Barrios in the capital. He did his higher education in various national and foreign academies, but mostly 3 years in the War College in Turin, Italy, where he returned to the country in October 1943. On December 14, 1948, there was a coup d'état of the \\"young soldiers\\" against President Salvador Castaneda Castro. Osorio, in the end with the rank of major, was added as a diplomatic mission in El Salvador in Mexico, and was called to lead the provisional government called the Revolutionary Council government, formed by Major Oscar Bolaños and civilians Reynaldo Galindo Pohl and Humberto Costa. Under the new constitution of 1950 the presidential elections were held. In the elections of that year, he presented himself as a candidate of the Revolutionary Party of Democratic Unification, founded in 1945 and beat the only opposition candidate, Colonel José Menéndez Ascencio, who was presented by the Action Party Renovadora. He assumed the constitutional presidency of El Salvador in 1950 and Osorio's government coincided with a period of calm because the coffee and cotton prices rose considerably. His presidency had adopted a plan of social reforms including the introduction of Social Security for urban workers and the creation of the Institute of Urban Housing (IVU) and developmental measures (pulse limited industrialization). With what he perceived the state in taxes on exports of coffee were initiated numerous public works, particularly the establishment of the Executive Committee on Ports, ECA, the construction of the Hydroelectric Dam \\"November 5, and the Coastal Highway the \\"Golden Bridge\\" on the Lempa River, numerous schools and multifamily housing complexes. It was also celebrated with great pomp the anniversary of the coup d'état of December 14 (officially known as the Revolution of 1948).These economic reforms largely helped the middle class and urban residents. https://www.britannica.com/place/El-Salvador/Military-dictatorships#ref468014 There was also a strong impetus to the arts, and he established a scholarship scheme for artists to study abroad. At the same time, however, together with the democratic opening, Osorio created rules that put the country under a suspension of individual rights and collective, known as the Law on Defense of the Constitutional Order. Based on it, from 1952 until the end of his term, Osorio had developed a policy of selective repression against labor leaders and students, before the rise of the popular movement that emerged from the struggles that led to the overthrow of General Maximiliano Hernández Martínez in 1944. Osorio passed as political disappearances the imprisonment of the most important leaders of the Salvadoran left—labor leaders Salvador Cayetano Carpio and his wife Tula Alvarenga, the student leader Gabriel Gallegos Valdés and academic Celestino Castro. All were interrogated and tortured by the National Police, as documented in his book Abduction and Hood, first published in 1956. The features of the government Osorio called Revolution 48 were: His continued representation as of 1932 as the government of the oligarchy and imperialism. With the rising price of coffee, there was a boom in the country. In tandem with the high rhetoric, the government of Colonel Osorio accentuated the line of repression and terror against the democratic movement organized in the country. After splitting the labor movement and supporting a central reactionary movement with the full support of the state machinery, the Osores- led government acted against the organization of the working class in El Salvador in an attempt to repress it, albeit less intensely than in 1932. At the time of Osorio, people began growing cotton on a large scale in the plains of the coast, especially in the east. Another important fact is the Central American economic integration treaties signed in 1951. Osorio died in Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas, United States, as a result of kidney failure complicated by pneumonia. ==Military ranks== * Promoted to lieutenant on December 12, 1931 * Promoted to lieutenant on June 15, 1934 * Promoted to captain on October 15, 1937 * Promoted to captain staff on October 15, 1937 * Promoted to lieutenant colonel on September 9, 1950 ==Decorations== * 60px Collar of the Order of the Aztec Eagle (Mexico, July 1951) * 60px Grand Cross of the Order of Bernardo O'Higgins (Chile, October 1951) * 60px Grand Cross of the Order of Rubén Darío (Nicaragua, January 1952) * 60px Extraordinary Grand Cross of the Order of Vasco Núñez de Balboa (Panama, September 1952) * 60px Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit (Ecuador, May 1953) * 60px Grand Cross Special Class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (Germany, December 1954) * 60px Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (Italy, February 1955) ==References== Category:1910 births Category:1969 deaths Category:People from Sonsonate Department Category:Salvadoran Protestants Category:Salvadoran people of Spanish descent Category:Presidents of El Salvador Category:Salvadoran military personnel Category:Grand Crosses Special Class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Category:Recipients of the Order of the Aztec Eagle Category:Revolutionary Party of Democratic Unification politicians ","title":"Óscar Osorio"},{"id":"2234773","text":"A 2007 design for \\"Hooah\\" bar, as packaged in MREs The Soldier Fuel bar, formerly known as Hooah! bar, is a dairy-based calcium-enriched energy bar created by the United States military in 1996.

He is best known for his time in World Wrestling Entertainment, where he performed under the ring name DJ Gabriel. Lewington currently wrestles independently as \\"The Swole-verine\\" Bronson. ==Professional wrestling careerAll Star Wrestling and Ohio Valley Wrestling (2003–2005)=== After graduating from Senior School Sixth Form at the Forest School Winnersh, Lewington attended Farnborough College of Technology where he earned a Higher National Diploma in Aeronautical Engineering. After developing an interest in professional wrestling, however, Lewington applied and was accepted to attend an Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) tryout in America between 23 and 28 February 2003. Lewington's official training began 8 months later in the beginners' class at the Old Davis arena. Lewington would return to England in late 2004 where he would work with All Star Wrestling. Throughout early 2005, Lewington would train and appear with ASW as well as becoming the subject of an episode of UKTV People's Secret Life of the Gym. ===World Wrestling Entertainment=== While WWE was touring England in 2005, Lewington would make three appearances on its main programming, once as a jobber on Carlito's Cabana interview segment, again as a jobber to Kurt Angle after Angle disrespected England and once as part of the WWE security squad that helped keep the warring Raw and SmackDown! wrestlers apart. Other British wrestlers including Robbie Brookside and Thunder were a part of the security team. After his appearances in WWE programming in 2005, Lewington stayed in the United Kingdom to compete for the All Star Wrestling (ASW) promotion, under the ring name Steve Sonic. On 17 January 2006 in Croydon, Sonic faced Drew McDonald in a ladder match for the ASW British Heavyweight Championship, and won. Sonic would remain champion for several months before relinquishing the title to return to WWE's developmental promotion in July 2006. Developmental territories (2006–2008) During April 2006, WWE would once again tour England allowing Lewington to make another appearance on Raw on 24 April, losing to Umaga. His performance in this match would earn Lewington a developmental deal. After receiving his contract, Lewington was sent to OVW and formed a tag team called \\"Terminal Velocity\\" with Chet the Jett. After Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) opened, however, Terminal Velocity was moved down to the new territory. After a brief run in FCW, Terminal Velocity was called back up to OVW and won the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship for the first time, giving Lewington the first tag team championship of his career. On 26 September 2007, Lewington and Chet lost the championship to The James Boys (KC James and Kassidy James). After their title loss, both members of Terminal Velocity were moved back down to FCW. After their return to FCW, however, Terminal Velocity split up when Chet renamed himself Mariouz Jablonski and developed an in-ring persona based on his Polish ancestry. Lewington later began teaming with Heath Miller and both advanced to the finals of a tournament to crown the inaugural FCW Florida Tag Team Champions, but they were defeated by The Puerto Rican Nightmares (Eddie Colón and Eric Pérez). Lewington and Miller defeated Brandon Groom and Greg Jackson and The Thoroughbreds (Johnny Curtis and Kevin Kiley) en route to the finals. On 4 March 2008 he changed his name to \\"Jack Gabriel\\". ECW (2008–2009) On 18 November 2008, Lewington made his debut as a face in ECW, under the ring name \\"DJ Gabriel\\", with a dancing persona, and was managed by Alicia Fox. He defeated local wrestler Sal Rinauro in his debut match for the brand. Over the next weeks, he defeated several jobbers, before defeating Paul Burchill on the last episode of ECW in 2008. On 13 January 2009 episode of ECW, Gabriel and Fox defeated The Burchills, Paul and Katie Lea, in a mixed tag team match. On 24 February, Lewington suffered his ECW first loss since coming to the brand against Mark Henry. Several weeks later Gabriel lost to Tyson Kidd in a singles match, which was his last televised match on the brand. On 15 April 2009, Fox returned to the SmackDown brand as a part of the 2009 Supplemental Draft, leaving Gabriel on his own. Departure (2009–2010) After Fox returned to SmackDown, Lewington was sent back to FCW and developed a new character of a \\"true British man\\", while his ring name was tweaked to simply Gabriel.

Many of her designs are considered \\"over the top\\" and embellished. She also is known for doing a cartwheel ending in a split at the end of her fashion shows. ==Early life and education== Johnson was born in Wethersfield, Connecticut, the second of three children born to Lena and John Johnson. She has an elder sister, Sally, and a younger brother, Robert. Johnson grew up in Terryville, Connecticut and took many dance classes, which inspired her love of costumes.\\"Betsey Johnson Still Loves Cheerleaders and the Prom\\". New York Magazine, February 14, 2012. Following her graduation from high school, Johnson studied at the Pratt Institute and then later graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Syracuse University where she was a member of the Alpha Xi Delta women's sorority. After graduation, she spent a summer as an intern at Mademoiselle magazine. ==Career== Johnson's fashion career started after she entered and won the Mademoiselle Guest Editor Contest. Within a year, she was the in-house designer for Manhattan boutique Paraphernalia. Johnson became part of both the youthquake fashion movement and Andy Warhol's underground scene, along with The Velvet Underground, Edie Sedgwick, Nico, and Lou Reed. In 1969, she opened a boutique called Betsey Bunky Nini on New York City's Upper East Side. Edie Sedgwick was her house model and Johnson designed the clothing Sedgwick wore on her last film, Ciao! Manhattan. In the 1970s, Johnson took control of the fashion label \\"Alley Cat\\" which was popular with the rock 'n roll musicians of the day. In her first year, her debut collection for Alley Cat reportedly sold $5 million in volume. In September 1971 she received the Coty Fashion Critics' Award (a 'Winnie'). In 1978, Johnson started her own fashion line. Her second collection did not sell well, leaving her with 3,000 pieces of spring clothing and insufficient funds to stage a 1981 fashion show to sell them and Johnson opened a retail store in the SoHo area of New York City. She designed the dress that Lisa Loeb wore in the music video for her 1994 hit \\"Stay (I Missed You)\\". In 2002, Johnson was inducted into the Fashion Walk of Fame. Her bronze plaque held one of her original sketches. In 2003, she expanded her line for 2004 to include handbags, accessories, hats, and scarves. In 2008, Johnson was a contributor to Carrie Borzillo-Vrenna's book Cherry Bomb. The National Arts Club awarded Johnson the 2009 Medal of Honor for Lifetime Achievement in Fashion. She once described her style as a formula: \\"Take a leotard and add a skirt.\\" As of 2011, she has more than 65 stores worldwide. On April 26, 2012, Betsey Johnson, LLC filed voluntarily for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On September 12, 2012, she celebrated 40 years of her brand with a retrospective fashion show with Cyndi Lauper performing. As of May 2013, Johnson and her daughter Lulu Johnson have a reality TV show that airs on the Style Network. On September 4, 2014, it was announced that Johnson would be one of the celebrities competing on the 19th season of Dancing with the Stars. The couple was eliminated in week 4, finishing in 10th place. In 2018, Johnson appeared on Sugar Rush as a guest judge (Episode: \\"Frosted Fashion\\"). ==Personal life== Johnson is a long-term breast cancer survivor. Johnson has been married three times. She married John Cale in 1968. They divorced in 1969. Johnson then married Jeffrey Oliviere in 1981. They divorced in 1984. Johnson's current husband is Brian Reynolds, they married in 1997. ==References* * Betsey Johnson: America's 25 most Fascinating Entrepreneurs * Betsey Johnson: New York Fashion Designer * Women Making History: Betsey Johnson Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:American fashion designers Category:People from Wethersfield, Connecticut Category:Syracuse University alumni Category:Breast cancer survivors Category:21st-century American politicians Category:People from Terryville, Connecticut Category:Women fashion designers ","title":"Betsey Johnson"},{"id":"2234793","text":"Eastern Orthodox cross July 24 - Eastern Orthodox calendar - July 26 All fixed commemorations below are celebrated on August 7 by Old Calendar.

Category:July in the Eastern Orthodox calendar ","title":"July 25 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)"},{"id":"2234797","text":"Enhanced SpeedStep is a series of dynamic frequency scaling technologies (codenamed Geyserville and including SpeedStep, SpeedStep II, and SpeedStep III) built into some Intel microprocessors that allow the clock speed of the processor to be dynamically changed (to different P-states) by software. This allows the processor to meet the instantaneous performance needs of the operation being performed, while minimizing power draw and heat generation. EIST (SpeedStep III) was introduced in several Prescott 6 series in the first quarter of 2005, namely the Pentium 4 660. Intel Speed Shift Technology (SST) was introduced in Intel Skylake Processor. Enhanced Intel SpeedStep is sometimes abbreviated as EIST. Intel's trademark of \\"INTEL SPEEDSTEP\\" was cancelled due to the trademark being invalidated in 2012. ==Explanation== Running a processor at high clock speeds allows for better performance. However, when the same processor is run at a lower frequency (speed), it generates less heat and consumes less power. In many cases, the core voltage can also be reduced, further reducing power consumption and heat generation. By using SpeedStep, users can select the balance of power conservation and performance that best suits them, or even change the clock speed dynamically as the processor burden changes. The power consumed by a CPU with a capacitance C, running at frequency f and voltage V is approximately: : P = C V^2 f For a given processor, C is a fixed value. However, V and f can vary considerably. For example, for a 1.6 GHz Pentium M, the clock frequency can be stepped down in 200 MHz decrements over the range from 1.6 to 0.6 GHz. At the same time, the voltage requirement decreases from 1.484 to 0.956 V. The result is that the power consumption theoretically goes down by a factor of 6.4. In practice, the effect may be smaller because some CPU instructions use less energy per tick of the CPU clock than others. For example, when an operating system is not busy, it tends to issue x86 halt (HLT) instructions, which suspend operation of parts of the CPU for a time period, so it uses less energy per tick of the CPU clock than when executing productive instructions in its normal state. For a given rate of work, a CPU running at a higher clock rate will execute a greater proportion of HLT instructions. The simple equation which relates power, voltage and frequency above also does not take into account the static power consumption of the CPU. This tends not to change with frequency, but does change with temperature and voltage. Hot electrons, and electrons exposed to a stronger electric field are more likely to migrate across a gate as \\"gate leakage\\" current, leading to an increase in static power consumption. Older processors such as the Pentium 4-M, which use older versions of SpeedStep, have fewer clock-speed increments. SpeedStep technology is partly responsible for the reduced power consumption of Intel’s Pentium M processor, part of the Centrino brand. ==Known issues== Microsoft has reported that there may be problems previewing video files when SpeedStep (or the AMD equivalent PowerNow!) is enabled under Windows 2000 or Windows XP. ==Operating system support== * Solaris has supported SpeedStep since OpenSolaris SXDE 9/07. * Older versions of Microsoft Windows, Windows 2000 and earlier, need a special driver and dashboard application to access the SpeedStep feature. Intel's website specifically states that such drivers must come from the computer manufacturer; there are no generic drivers supplied by Intel which will enable SpeedStep for older Windows versions if one cannot obtain a manufacturer's driver. * Under Microsoft Windows XP, SpeedStep support is built into the power management console under the control panel. In Windows XP a user can regulate processor speed indirectly by changing power schemes. The \\"Home/Office Desk\\" setting disables SpeedStep, the \\"Portable/Laptop\\" power scheme enables SpeedStep, and the \\"Max Battery\\" uses SpeedStep to slow the processor to minimal power levels as the battery weakens. The SpeedStep settings for power schemes, either built-in or custom, cannot be modified from the control panel's GUI, but can be modified using the POWERCFG.EXE command- line utility. * The Linux kernel has a subsystem, tunable by power-scheme and command line, devoted to the control of the operating frequency and voltage of a CPU. Linux runs on Intel, AMD, and other makes of CPU. * Newer version Windows 10 and Linux kernel support Intel Speed Shift Technology. In contrast, AMD has supplied and supported drivers for its competing PowerNow! technology that work on Windows 2000, ME, 98, and NT. ==See also== * Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) * AMD PowerTune (for GPUs) * AMD Turbo Core (for CPUs) * Cool'n'Quiet * CPU-Z * Dynamic frequency scaling * Intel Turbo Boost * Power management ==References== Category:Clock signal Category:Computer hardware tuning Category:Intel products ","title":"SpeedStep"},{"id":"2234805","text":"A glass of Japanese Calpis A glass of Fanta melon soda A glass of German fassbrause A glass of ginger ale A glass of Swedish Julmust Kickapoo Joy Juice originated in the United States Orange soda Japanese Ramune Glasses of Red Bull Cola This is a list of soft drinks in order of the brand's country of origin.

Note that the set of ∞-Borel sets may not actually be closed under wellordered union; see below. ==Formal definition== More formally: we define by simultaneous transfinite recursion the notion of ∞-Borel code, and of the interpretation of such codes. Since X is Polish, it has a countable base. Let \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\mathcal{N}_ii<\\\\omega\\\\right\\\\rangle enumerate that base (that is, \\\\mathcal{N}_i is the i^\\\\mathrm{th} basic open set). Now: * Every natural number i is an ∞-Borel code. Its interpretation is \\\\mathcal{N}_i. * If c is an ∞-Borel code with interpretation A_c, then the ordered pair \\\\left\\\\langle 0,c\\\\right\\\\rangle is also an ∞-Borel code, and its interpretation is the complement of A_c, that is, X\\\\setminus A_c. * If \\\\vec c is a length-α sequence of ∞-Borel codes for some ordinal α (that is, if for every β<α, c_\\\\beta is an ∞-Borel code, say with interpretation A_{c_{\\\\beta}}), then the ordered pair \\\\left\\\\langle1,\\\\vec c\\\\right\\\\rangle is an ∞-Borel code, and its interpretation is \\\\bigcup_{\\\\beta<\\\\alpha}A_{c_{\\\\beta}}. Now a set is ∞-Borel if it is the interpretation of some ∞-Borel code. The axiom of choice implies that every set can be wellordered, and therefore that every subset of every Polish space is ∞-Borel. Therefore, the notion is interesting only in contexts where AC does not hold (or is not known to hold). Unfortunately, without the axiom of choice, it is not clear that the ∞-Borel sets are closed under wellordered union. This is because, given a wellordered union of ∞-Borel sets, each of the individual sets may have many ∞-Borel codes, and there may be no way to choose one code for each of the sets, with which to form the code for the union. The assumption that every set of reals is ∞-Borel is part of AD+, an extension of the axiom of determinacy studied by Woodin. ==Incorrect definition== It is very tempting to read the informal description at the top of this article as claiming that the ∞-Borel sets are the smallest class of subsets of X containing all the open sets and closed under complementation and wellordered union. That is, one might wish to dispense with the ∞-Borel codes altogether and try a definition like this: : For each ordinal α define by transfinite recursion Bα as follows: :# B0 is the collection of all open subsets of X. :# For a given even ordinal α, Bα+1 is the union of Bα with the set of all complements of sets in Bα. :# For a given even ordinal α, Bα+2 is the set of all wellordered unions of sets in Bα+1. :# For a given limit ordinal λ, Bλ is the union of all Bα for α<λ : It follows from the Burali-Forti paradox that there must be some ordinal α such that Bβ equals Bα for every β>α. For this value of α, Bα is the collection of \\"∞-Borel sets\\". This set is manifestly closed under well-ordered unions, but without AC it cannot be proved equal to the ∞-Borel sets (as defined in the previous section). Specifically, it is instead the closure of the ∞-Borel sets under all well-ordered unions, even those for which a choice of codes cannot be made. ==Alternative characterization== For subsets of Baire space or Cantor space, there is a more concise (if less transparent) alternative definition, which turns out to be equivalent. A subset A of Baire space is ∞-Borel just in case there is a set of ordinals S and a first-order formula φ of the language of set theory such that, for every x in Baire space, : x\\\\in A\\\\iff L[S,x]\\\\models\\\\phi(S,x) where L[S,x] is Gödel's constructible universe relativized to S and x. When using this definition, the ∞-Borel code is made up of the set S and the formula φ, taken together. ==References== *W.H.

Walter Thompson (JWT) was an advertisement holding company incorporated in 1896 by American advertising pioneer James Walter Thompson. The company was acquired in 1987 by multinational holding company WPP plc, and in November 2018, WPP merged J. Walter Thompson with fellow agency Wunderman to form Wunderman Thompson. ==HistoryPre-James Walter Thompson=== J. Walter Thompson traces its origins to the Carlton & Smith agency, which opened its doors in 1864, one of the first known advertising agencies in the United States. Founder William James Carlton started selling advertising space in religious magazines, but almost nothing is known about the partner named Smith. The New York Times wrote that \\"the agency traces its roots to a newspaper space brokerage that began operation on Dec. 5, 1864.\\" ===1868 - 1969=== In 1868, Carlton hired James Walter Thompson as a bookkeeper. Eventually, Thompson found that soliciting and sales were much more profitable, and he became a very effective salesman for the small company. In 1877, Thompson purchased the business of his employer for $500 and, a year later, purchased the office furniture for $800. He changed the company designation to J. Walter Thompson, as he felt that James Thompson was too common a name in New York. One of his first clients was a personal friend – Robert Wood Johnson, one of the three brothers who founded Johnson & Johnson – for whom Thomson personally wrote advertising for the toothpaste brand Zonweis Thompson, who had served as a U.S. Marine during the Civil War, had first been employed by Carlton & Smith to sell space in religious publications. Under his leadership, the agency became the seller of advertising space in many American magazines and periodicals. By 1889, 80 percent of the advertising in the United States was placed through J. Walter Thompson.Applegate, E. (2012). Stanley B. Resor and the J. Walter Thompson Company: 1908-1961. In The rise of advertising in the United States: A history of innovation to 1960 (p. 134). Lanham: Scarecrow Press In 1896, the company incorporated. More growth followed, and J. Walter Thompson became the first American agency to expand internationally with the opening of J. Walter Thompson London in 1899. The business subsequently expanded across the globe, being one of the first American agencies in Egypt, South Africa and Asia.Ciochetto, L. (2011). China. In Globalisation and advertising in emerging economies: Brazil, Russia, India, and China (p. 95). London: Routledge In a special 1964 commemorative issue celebrating the agency's centennial, Advertising Age wrote that the \\"history and expansion overseas\\" of the J. Walter Thompson Co. \\"seems peculiarly to match the whole history of modern advertising.\\" ===1969 - 2018 === In 1969, J. Walter Thompson became a public corporation. In the mid-1970s, J. Walter Thompson was hired by the military dictatorship of Chile, led by Augusto Pinochet, to \\"refurbish the image of the regime\\" after international and Chilean human-rights organizations had documented extensive violations. In 1980, the company was organized into a holding company JWT Group, consisting of J. Walter Thompson Company; Hill & Knowlton; and Lord Geller Federico & Einstein. In 1987, British media giant WPP acquired JWT Group. In 2005, the company renamed itself as JWT. As of 2014, its most longstanding clients included Unilever/Lever Brothers (109+ years); Mondelēz International/Kraft Foods (89+ years); Kimberly-Clark (84+ years); Nestlé (81+ years); Kellogg's (80+ years); and Ford Motor (67+ years). Other notable clients include Avon, Treasury Wine Estates, Edgewell/Schick, Tudor, HSBC, Johnson & Johnson, Newell, Air Canada and the United States Marine Corps. JWT celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2014 by reverting to its \\"classic\\" J. Walter Thompson name. In 2015, JWT launched Colloquial, a content-marketing joint venture unit with Group SJR; Also in 2015, the company acquired a minority stake in Turkish independent digital agency Wanda Digital. In 2016, the company acquired iStrategyLabs (ISL), a Washington, D.C.-based digital agency. ===Merger with Wunderman=== J. Walter Thompson Co. ceased its independent existence when holding company owner WPP announced in November, 2018 that it was merging the agency into the digital agency Wunderman. While called a merger of equals, observers note that it is really a takeover by Wunderman and an end to JWT, noting of the end of America’s first ad agency that its \\"demise is a metaphor of the demise of Madison Avenue.\\" At the time, the company was headquartered in New York City and had more than 200 offices in over 90 countries and employed over 12,000 marketing professionals. ===Legacy=== J. Walter Thompson was among the first agencies to employ writers and artists to create interesting advertisements for their clients, replacing the standard ads created by in-house departments. It was also the first agency to provide a wide range of advertising services to clients, including copy, layout, package design, trademark development and rudimentary, market research. Many of these methods can be seen in notable work that the agency has produced, including work for Kraft Cheese that resulted in the creation of the grilled-cheese sandwich, a campaign for Swift & Co. that added measurement marks to sticks of butter, the Toys \\"R\\" Us Kid slogan and jingle, De Beers diamond ads (\\"A Diamond is Forever\\") and the \\"I wish I were an Oscar Mayer Weiner\\" campaign. The agency is also credited with hiring the first female copywriter, Helen Lansdowne Resor. While with the agency, she pioneered ideas including celebrity testimonials, sex appeal, and was responsible for developing its reputation as an agency where bright young women could succeed. Lansdowne went on to become the first female creative director in the industry. To honor this legacy, in 2014 J. Walter Thompson announced a $250,000 scholarship opportunity called the Helen Lansdowne Resor Scholarship. It assists and promotes talented female creative advertising students who aspire to join the ranks of creative leadership. The New York Times reported that \\"some two million other documents ... (are) .. within the J. Walter Thompson Archives at Duke University in Durham, N.C.\\" Among these are internal position papers for JWT being challenged by and countering the American Medical Association. Many of these documents are the basis of the agency's award-winning creative work. ==Criticism== In June 2018, then CEO, Gustavo Martinez officially parted ways with J. Walter Thompson (JWT) and parent company WPP two months after settling a sexual harassment case brought by a female colleague. In May 2018 Jo Wallace the creative director of the London branch, who identifies as a gay woman, stated at Creative Equals conference that she would \\"obliterate JWT’s reputation as an agency full of white, English, privileged, straight men\\". According to a Business Insider article, five straight, white men queried this statement with the company's human resources department and were later fired. The men have reportedly retained a solicitor to consider a case of discrimination. ==Clients== J.

De Mairan lost his father, François d'Ortous, at age four and his mother twelve years later at age sixteen. Over the course of his life, de Mairan was elected into numerous scientific societies and made key discoveries in a variety of fields including ancient texts and astronomy. His observations and experiments also inspired the beginning of what is now known as the study of biological circadian rhythms. At the age of 92, de Mairan died of pneumonia in Paris on 20 February 1771. ==Biography == De Mairan attended college in Toulouse from 1694-1697 with a focus in ancient Greek. In 1698 he went to Paris to study mathematics and physics under the teachings of Nicolas Malebranche. In 1702, he returned home to Béziers and began his lifelong study of several fields, most notably astronomy and plant rhythms. Furthermore, during his time in Béziers, he ate almost every day with the Bishop, Louis-Charles des Alris de Rousset. In 1723, de Mairan, who had become a member of the Académie Royale des Sciences, co- founded the Académie de Béziers under the protection of Cardinal de Fleury, acting prime minister of Louis XV (and himself a protégé of a former Bishop of Béziers, Pierre de Bonsi). Eventually, de Mairan received official lodging in the Louvre where he remained pensionnaire until 1743 and served as secretary from 1741 to 1743. In 1746, he was reinstated as pensionnaire géomètre, or full-time boarding surveyor. It is reported that the Prince of Conti and other great lords heaped extravagant gifts upon him. He was also secretary to the Duke of Orléans. ===Observations and notable experiments=== *In 1719, De Mairan discussed the varying obliquity of light that causes cold in winter and heat in summer. He postulated that the sun's heating effect was related to the square of the sine of its elevation. He neglected the effects of atmosphere, admitting that he did not know how much the sun's heat would be absorbed by it. Two and a half years later, he presented a paper to the Academie Royale des Sciences in Paris: \\"Problem: the ratio of two degrees or quantities of sunlight seen through the atmosphere at two different known angular elevations being given, to find what part of the absolute light of the sun is intercepted by the atmosphere at any desired elevation.\\" In this paper, de Mairan made a hypothesis based on mere observations, supposing that the ratio had been measured, even though it had not. The significance of de Mairan's work, although incorrect, led his protégé, Pierre Bouguer, to invent the photometer. * In 1729, de Mairan constructed an experiment showing the existence of a circadian rhythm in plants, presumably originating from an endogenous clock (See 'Experiment on circadian rhythms in plants' below). * In 1731, he also observed a nebulosity around a star near the Orion nebula. This was later designated M43 by Charles Messier. ==Experiment on circadian rhythms in plants== In 1729, de Mairan performed an experiment that demonstrated the existence of circadian rhythms in plants, specifically the Mimosa pudica. He was intrigued by the daily opening and closing of the heliotrope plant and performed a simple experiment where he exposed the plants to constant darkness and recorded the behaviour. De Mairan's key conclusion was that the daily rhythmic opening and closing of the leaves persisted even in the absence of sunlight. However, de Mairan did not infer that heliotropes have internal clocks driving leaf rhythms, but rather that they were able \\"to sense the Sun without ever seeing it\\". The concept of an internal clock was actually not formulated until much later, although de Mairan did suggest that \\"it would be curious to test [...] whether, using kilns heated to higher or lower temperatures, one could artificially recreate a day & night perceptible to [plants]; and whether in doing so one could reverse the order of the phenomena of true day & true night.\\"de Mairan's paper can be accessed here, together with its analysis in the light of present views of circadian rhythms. That analysis is available in English. These results may have gone unnoticed had his colleague, Marchant, not published them for de Mairan. Alternatively, it may be that de Mairan simply was not available to present this work himself. It was quite common at the time, when travels were slow, for one scientist to present the work of another. Whatever the case, this rather obscure one-page contribution by a prolific and highly respected Academician did stand the test of time. It is by far the most if not the only paper by de Mairan which is still quoted in the current scientific literature (bar purely historical reviews). Indeed, when describing his work with eclosion rhythms in his Drosophila models or the rhythmic running activity of mice, founder of modern chronobiology, Colin Pittendrigh, recognised the work of Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan. A video showing circadian rhythms in a cucumber plant in constant conditions, similar to what de Mairan observed, can be seen . ===de Mairan's experimental legacy=== Despite Marchant's publication of de Mairan's work, which might have suggested the existence of endogenous biological clocks, rhythms in plant movements were for a long time thought to be extrinsically controlled, by light and dark cycles, or magnetic and temperature oscillations, or even a mysterious, yet-to-be identified X-factor. In 1823, almost a century after de Mairan's work, the Swiss botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle expanded on it by measuring the free running period of Mimosa pudica leaf movements in constant conditions, finding them to be 22–23 hours long. This was probably the first hint of what is now called the circadian (from Latin circa, about, and diem) nature of such endogenous rhythms, found in practically all living organisms, including some bacteria ==Scientific societies and recognition== In 1718, de Mairan was inducted into the Académie Royale des Sciences. The Cardinal de Fleury and the Count of Maurepas selected Mairan to replace Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle as \\"Secrétaire perpétuel\\" of the Académie in 1740, a position he accepted only for 3 years, and thus duly resigned in 1743. De Mairan also served as the Académie's assistant director and later director intermittently between 1721 and 1760. Eventually, de Mairan was appointed editor of the Journal des sçavans, a science periodical, by Chancellor d'Aguesseau. Also, in 1735, de Mairan was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1769, a Foreign Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences as well as to the Russian Academy (St. Petersburg) in 1718. De Mairan was also a member of the Royal Societies of London, Edinburgh, and Uppsala and the Institute of Bologna. With Jean Bouillet and Antoine Portalon, he founded his own scientific society in his hometown of Béziers around 1723. ==Key publications== Sur la question des forces vives, 1741 Beyond astronomical and circadian observations, de Mairan actively worked in several other fields of physics including \\"heat, light, sound, motion, the shape of the Earth, and the aurora\\". The following is an abbreviated list of publications (with their English translations) organised by Dr. Robert A. Hatch at the University of Florida: * Dissertation sur les variations du barometre (Bordeaux, 1715) (Essays on barometric variations) * Dissertation sur la glace (Bordeaux, 1716) (Essay on the ice) * Dissertation sur la cause de la lumiere des phosphores et des noctiluques (Bordeaux, 1717) (Dissertation on the cause of light phosphates and noctilucence or nightly light) * Dissertation sur l'estimation et la mesure des forces motrices des corps (1728) (Essay on the estimation of the measures of forces on the body) * Lettre de m. de Mairan a Madame.

Dedicated to the history of sports in Canada, it serves as a hall of fame and museum for accomplished Canadian athletes, and sports builders and officials. Established in 1955, the organization inducted its first class of hall of famers, and opened a museum to the public that year. The museum was originally located at Exhibition Place in Toronto. In 1957, the hall of fame moved to another facility at Exhibition Place, sharing the space with the Hockey Hall of Fame. A new building to house the two hall of fames was later built at Exhibition Place in 1961. The two halls of fame continued to share facilities until 1993, when the Hockey Hall of Fame moved to a different location. Canada's Sports Hall of Fame became the building's sole occupant until it was closed in 2006 to make way for BMO Field. The organization continued to induct honourees to its hall of fame, although a new facility to house its museum was not completed until 2011. The facility was opened at Canada Olympic Park in Calgary, and houses the organization's offices and hall of fame museum. As of 2019, there were 673 inductees into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, categorized either as athletes, or as builders of the sport. Inductees are nominated by the Canadian public, though are ultimately selected by the organization's selection committee. In addition to inductions into its hall of fame, the organization has also conferred awards for accomplishments in sport, and in the larger community. ==History== Stanley Barracks in Toronto from 1955 to 1957 Efforts to create a national sports hall of fame were spurred by Harry Price, the chairman of the sports committee of the Canadian National Exhibition, who began to travel across Canada in 1947 to gather support for a museum and hall of fame. The hall of fame museum was formally opened on 24 August 1955, at Stanley Barracks in Exhibition Place, Toronto. In 1957, the hall of fame was relocated to the Press Building in Exhibition Place, sharing the facilities with the Hockey Hall of Fame. After the Hockey Hall of Fame announced it would build a new museum and hall of fame building at Exhibition Place in 1958, it extended an invitation to Canada's Sports Hall of Fame to move into its new facility. The Hall of Fame building was officially opened on 1 May 1961, with Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, and the Hockey Hall of Fame as its occupants. Canada's Hall of Fame would share the same building with the Hockey Hall of Fame until 1993, when the Hockey Hall of Fame moved into Brookfield Place in downtown Toronto. The Hockey Hall of Fames' move to downtown Toronto led to a decline in attendance, and in the late 1990s, plans were made to move the hall of fame to Ottawa. However, the federal government cancelled those plans in 1999. Canada's Sports Hall of Fame closed its museum to the public in 2006, with the building demolished to make way for BMO Field. The organization placed its collections in storage at Stanley Barracks, until a new facility to house the museum was completed. In 2008, the hall of fame's board of governors announced a national bid for a new permanent location for the museum. Nine cities submitted bids to host the museum, although the city of Calgary was eventually selected. Constructed at Canada Olympic Park, funding was provided by the federal government, provincial, and municipal government; in addition to private funds. The federal government contributed C$15 million to the construction budget, whereas the provincial government contributed C$10 million, and the municipal government contributing C$5 million. Canada's Sports Hall of Fame was tasked with raising an additional C$20 million to help pay operational expenses. The building opened to the public on 1 July 2011. Ceremony for the inaugural members of the hall of fame's Order of Sport, October 2019 In 2019, the hall of fame introduced the People's Choice Award, to recognize an individual sport champion who also contributes to charities and local communities. The inaugural winner of the award was champion golfer and 9-time winner on the LPGA Tour, Brooke Henderson. In the same year, the organization also introduced the Order of Sport Award, which served as a physical award for being inductee to the hall of fame. ==Building== The building cantilevers from the ground The hall of fame and museum building is located Canada Olympic Road, at Canada Olympic Park, a ski hill and multi-purpose training and competition facility in Calgary. The museum was formerly located at Exhibition Place in Toronto, before it relocated to a new permanent facility in Calgary. Completed in 2011, Canada's Hall of Fame building was designed by Stantec, on behalf of CANA Construction, the project manager and design-lead for the museum. The exterior facade with its cantilevered structure, was designed to mimic the elevated platforms where athletes receive their medals. The building colour of red and white was taken from the colours of the flag of Canada. The structure was designed to be a sustainable building, and received LEED Silver certification. The interior of the building is made of three components, the museum and exhibition halls, the organization's office space, and storage space for the museum's collections. All components of the building is connected through a two-and-a-half storey atrium. ===Museum=== The museum and exhibit hall was purposely designed on the upper level of the building, with the upper level having more floor area than the floor below it. The museum space takes up approximately of the building's floor space. The upper level is perched on the glass and steel structure, and cantilevers above the lower floor, creating the illusion that the upper level was floating. The cantilevered area also holds exhibits on individual sports. Exhibit on cycling at Canada's Sports Hall of Fame The museum space features twelve galleries, a theatre, and interactive exhibits on the hall of fame's inductees, and Canadian sport. The museum's twelve themed galleries located on various levels, are separated by a \\"series of bays\\". The exhibits are designed to circulate around the museum's central atrium or the \\"Grand Hall,\\" which houses six national trophy exhibits. The design of the museum exhibits was done by Cambridge Seven Associates. The museum's collections includes over 60,000 photographs, and 100,000 artifacts. ==Inductees== As of November 2019, Canada's Sports Hall of Fame had over 670 inductees, categorized either as athletes or builders of the sport. Beginning with the induction of the 2019 class of hall of famers, Canada's Sports Hall of Fame began to issue the Order of Sport award to inductees, as a physical token of their induction into the hall of fame. Hall of famers that were inducted prior to 2019 were all retroactively made \\"peers\\" of the order, upon its creation. Nominations for inductees are accepted from the Canadian public throughout the year. Athletes nominated are required to have been retired for at least four years, although builders may be nominated when they are still active in their careers. Animals and inanimate objects may be considered for induction, although their nomination requires the approval of the Hall's Board of Governors. A new group of inductees has been introduced into Canada's Hall of Fame annually since its inception in 1955. The annual election of nominees is chosen through a selection committee of ten to 16 people. ===Canadian sport legends class=== On June 17, 2015, the Hall of Fame introduced the Sport Legends class of inductees, made up of athletes whose careers occurred before 1955. The creation of the Sport Legend class was undertaken in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of Canada.

It will launch its first products with the rollout of the 3.0 operating system for those devices. Prior to this, Jeffery was the president of Sega of America from 2004 to 2009. He was president of LucasArts between 2000 and 2003, and a director at the company for three years beforehand. Prior to joining LucasArts, Jeffery worked in a number of marketing, business and development roles for Virgin Interactive and Electronic Arts. At Sega, Jeffery plans to recruit Western development houses to work with Japanese Sega IP and strengthening Sega's game production in the West in general.http://www.next- gen.biz/features/simon-jeffery At E3 2008 Jeffery told Sega fans there is not going to be a new console from Sega, and no current plans to develop a Shenmue 3. This kills off hope of a Dreamcast 2 and downheartens many Sega fans who still believed it would happen. Jeffery's main accomplishment during his tenure at LucasArts was forging new relations with external developers to fully develop the Star Wars gaming IP, such as Pandemic Studios, Planet Moon Studios, The Collective, Raven Software and BioWare. Several of LucasArts' most revered and successful Star Wars games were launched during this period, including Rogue Squadron, Jedi Knight II, Star Wars: Battlefront, and Knights of the Old Republic. However, his goal of turning around a creative original IP slump at the company was never fully realized. According to Jeffery, LucasArts had too heavily relied on its Star Wars license, but successful new IP failed to materialize. Games such as Gladius and RTX Red Rock did not achieve critical acclaim or great sales; follow-ups to classic LucasArts adventure games, Full Throttle: Hell on Wheels and Sam & Max: Freelance Police were cancelled, to much dismay of the fans. (An online petition to save Freelance Police got over 31000 signatures.) Simon Jeffery later became the subject of several fan animations in the LucasArts fan community, often depicted as a Jesus-like figure. Jeffery is a big Star Wars fan and once claimed to have seen A New Hope 93 times. ==References== Category:Ngmoco Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Sega people Category:American entertainment industry businesspeople Category:Video game businesspeople ","title":"Simon Jeffery"},{"id":"2234844","text":"Odds and evens is a simple game of chance and hand game, involving two people simultaneously revealing a number of fingers and winning or losing depending on whether they are odd or even, or alternatively involving one person taking picking up coins or other small objects and hiding them in their closed hand, while another player guesses whether they have an odd or even number. The game may be used to make a decision or played for fun. The finger game is also known as swords, choosies, pick, odds-on poke, or bucking up. This zero-sum game, a variation of the ancient morra and par-impar, is played in Europe and the US, especially among children. ==History== Even-Odd as an early form of roulette This game was known by the Greeks (as artiazein) and Romans (as ludere par impar). In the 1858 Krünitzlexikon it says:Krünitzlexikon von 1858 \\"The game Odds and Evens was very common amongst the Romans and was played either with tali, tesseris, or money and known as \\"Alea maior\\", or with nuts, beans and almonds and known as \\"Alea minor\\".\\"http://www.kruenitz1.uni- trier.de/xxx/g/kg01509.htm A medieval reference is found in the Renner by Hugo von Trimberg (verse 2695). Odds and Evens (Gerade und Ungerade) is included in the list of games prohibited in Austria-Hungary in 1904 by the Ministry of Justice. == Playing == The game has similarities with the finger game of Morra or Fingerlosere one person hides their hand and then quickly folds or extends one's fingers and the other player has to guess how many fingers are folded or extended. Meyers Konversationslexikon 1885-1892, Stichwort Gerade und Ungerade In Odds and Evens, however, individuals prepare by deciding who will be assigned odds and who will be evens. Then, one or both people say \\"One, two, three, shoot!\\" or \\"once, twice, three, shoot!\\" As the word \\"shoot\\" is said, the two people quickly and simultaneously thrust a fist into the center, extending either an index finger, or both the middle and index finger, indicating one or two. The sum total of fingers displayed is either odd or even. If the result is odd, then the person who called odds is the victor, and can decide the issue as they see fit. Often, the participants continue to shoot for a best two out of three. From a game-theoretic perspective, the game is equivalent to matching pennies. See that article for analysis of the strategies and chances of winning. ==Adaption== The name Even-Odd or EO (Gerade und Ungerade) was even given to a predecessor of roulette in the 18th century. This continues today in modern roulette in the bets on Pair and Impair. ==See also== * Chetno i likho – a game of chance where the players have to guess if the hidden objects are even or odd. * Coin flipping – a method of making a yes-or-no decision at random. * Drawing straws – a method of making a group decision - choosing one member of the group. * Matching pennies – a game of chance with a similar strategic structure, using coins instead of fingers. * Parity game – an unrelated (and much more complicated) two-player logic game, played on a colored graph. * Rock paper scissors – a game where each player has three alternatives instead of two. ==References== Category:Hand games Category:Sampling (statistics) Category:Gambling games Category:Historical games ","title":"Odds and evens (hand game)"},{"id":"2234846","text":"Leonid Borisovich Nevzlin (; , born 21 September 1959) is a Russian-born Israeli businessman, investor, and philanthropist. Nevzlin occupied various high-ranking positions at Group Menatep and its subsidiary, the Yukos Oil Company. In 2003, the Russian state expropriated Yukos and began a campaign of persecution against its executives. Nevzlin was tried in absentia in Russia in March 2008, found guilty of several counts of conspiracy to murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. In 2014, the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in favor of Nevzlin and other Yukos shareholders, calling the actions of the Russian state “a ruthless campaign to destroy Yukos and to expropriate its assets\\". ==Professional career== From 1981-87, Nevzlin was a software engineer at Zarubezhgeologia, an external trade organization of the Soviet Ministry of Geology. In 1987, he met Mikhail Khodorkovsky and became a Deputy Director at the Center for Scientific and Technical Creativity for Youth (MENATEP), attached to the Komsomol committee in Moscow's Frunzensky District. MENATEP established one of the first private banks in Russia, Bank Menatep. From 1989 to 1991, Nevzlin served as president of the bank, after which he held other high-ranking positions, including Vice Chairman of the Board (1993-1996) and Head of Public Relations (1994-1996). Nevzlin also worked at Group Menatep, focusing on corporate communications, government relations, and human resources. In April 1996 he became Vice President of Yukos, in which Menatep had acquired a 78% share in December 1995. From September 1997 to October 1998, Nevzlin served as first deputy director general of the Russian news agency ITAR TASS, creating a plan to gradually transform it into a joint-stock company. In April 1998, Nevzlin became First Vice Chairman of Bank Menatep. In 1999 he became First Vice Chairman of the board of directors of Yukos. From November 2001 to March 2003, he represented the Republic of Mordovia as a senator in the Federation Council of Russia. From June to November 2003, he served as the Rector of the Russian State University for the Humanities. In 2003 and 2004, Nevzlin was featured on Forbes magazine's list of the world’s 100 wealthiest people. In 2010, his wealth was estimated at US$1.3 billion. Nevzlin is a co-owner and board member of Haaretz, one of Israel’s liberal newspaper publishers, having purchased a 20% stake in the company in 2011 for 140 million shekels. Members of the Schocken family, descendants of the newspaper’s founders, retain a 60 percent stake in the company. In 2014, Nevzlin founded the monthly Hebrew-language magazine “Liberal,” which publishes analyses of Israeli political life, communications and culture. The inaugural issue appeared in May 2014. ===Legal disputes=== In 2003, following prolonged clashes with the Kremlin, Yukos’ controlling shareholder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and another senior executive, Platon Lebedev, were arrested on charges of fraud and tax evasion. Both were convicted in 2005 following trials that were widely condemned internationally as procedurally flawed and politically motivated. Khodorkovsky was found guilty and the sentence for tax evasion and fraud was upheld by the European Court of Human Rights for the same affair. Yukos’ assets were subsequently awarded to state-owned companies in a series of forced auctions. Yukos was declared bankrupt in August 2006. Nevzlin left Russia for Israel in 2003. In 2004 the Russian Prosecutor General's Office sought Nevzlin’s extradition over hotly disputed criminal allegations against him related to his tenure at Yukos. The Israeli government rejected the extradition request due to insufficient evidence. Two members of the public who felt aggrieved by the government’s decision sued to have it reversed. They also petitioned the interior minister to revoke Nevzlin’s Israeli citizenship on the grounds that it was obtained under false pretenses. Nevzlin’s attorney, David Libai, argued that the charges against him were the result of political persecution. A spokesman for Nevzlin stated in reaction to extradition request, \\"Amnesty International, the European Parliament, and the court in the UK, are only some of the bodies that have found that Russian president Vladimir Putin is persecuting Mikhail Khodorovsky, Leonid Nevzlin, and the other shareholders in Yukos, who dared to support democratic opposition parties and openly come out against him. Putin does not hesitate to make use of the Russian authorities that are subordinate to him to create false charges - in the best tradition of the KGB, in which Putin grew up.\\" In May 2008, Israel’s Supreme Court found there was no evidence directly connecting Nevzlin to the criminal allegations made against him. The court rejected extradition and denied the motion to strip Nevzlin of his citizenship. Israel's interior minister and attorney general were ordered to pay Nevzlin’s court costs for this case. Nevzlin was tried in absentia in Russia in March 2008, found guilty of several counts of conspiracy to murderВерховный суд признал пожизненное заключение для Леонида Невзлина законным // Коммерсантъ-Online, 27 января 2009.Невзлина признали убийцей // Росбалт, 1 августа 2008.Невзлин накануне Ходорковского // 17 декабря 2013. and sentenced to life imprisonment. Nevzlin called the court case a show trial orchestrated by Vladimir Putin. In 2014, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, despite the Russian Duma having never ratified the treaty under which this judgment has been made therefore making a non-legally binding judgment, ruled unanimously that the Russian authorities had conducted a “ruthless campaign to destroy Yukos, appropriate its assets and eliminate Mr. [Mikhail] Khodorkovsky as a political opponent.” According to the panel, the forced auction of core parts of the company through contested bankruptcy proceedings “was not driven by motives of tax collection but by the desire of the State to acquire Yukos’ most valuable asset and bankrupt Yukos…. In short, it was in effect a devious and calculated expropriation.” The former Yukos shareholders were awarded damages totaling $50 billion – the largest arbitration award in history. As the biggest shareholder of GML, the former Yukos holding company that brought the legal case, with a 70 per cent stake, Nevzlin stands to be the biggest single beneficiary from The Hague’s ruling. The Russian government failed to meet the deadline of January 15, 2015, for paying that award. Earlier news reports indicated that the former Yukos investors would seek redress by asking U.S. and EU courts to seize Russian- owned assets on their territory. ==Public affairs and philanthropy== Nevzlin was awarded the Order of Friendship, one of the Russian Federation’s highest honors, for his efforts in supporting Boris Yeltsin’s reelection campaign in 1996. From March to December 2001 Nevzlin served as president of the Russian Jewish Congress. He was a key player in Jewish historical and heritage research projects, including the establishment of the Moscow Jewish Cultural Center and the International Center for Russian and Eastern European Jewish Studies in Moscow. Moreover, Nevzlin contributed to numerous other Jewish educational programs developed in collaboration with World ORT, the Jewish Agency for Israel and the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. Since moving to Israel, Nevzlin has established the NADAV Foundation, which supports projects in Jewish studies and education, Israel-Diaspora relations and Jewish peoplehood. Its annual “NADAV Peoplehood Prize” has been awarded to such figures as author Elie Wiesel, retired Israeli Supreme Court Chief Justice Aharon Barak, and, most recently, Rabbi David Stav, an Israeli Orthodox rabbi. Nevzlin created the Leonid Nevzlin Research Center for Russian and Eastern European Jewry at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University. He has also served on the boards of both the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv University. In collaboration with the Israeli government, Nevzlin created a relief fund in 2004 to revive Beit Hatfutsot – the Museum of the Jewish People, located on the campus of Tel Aviv University, and was elected Chairman of its International Board of Governors. The NADAV Foundation launched the International School for Jewish Peoplehood Studies at Beit Hatfutsot in 2006, and the Nevzlin Center for Jewish Peoplehood at the Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya in 2010. Nevzlin has served on the Board of Governors of the Jewish Agency for Israel and the Board of Trustees of Keren Hayesod, the United Israel Appeal, and as Associate Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Jewish People Policy Planning Institute. Nevzlin is also a long-term supporter of Israeli healthcare charity Ezra Lemarpeh. ==Family and education== Nevzlin was born in Moscow on 21 September 1959 into a family of Belarusian-Jewish origin. He graduated from the Gubkin Russian State University of Oil and Gas in 1981, and earned an MA from the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, majoring in management and marketing. Nevzlin has married three times and has five children including Irina Nevzlin, chair of the board of Directors at Beit Hatfutsot. Through Irina, he is the father in law of Israeli politician Yuli-Yoel Edelstein. In 2014, Nevzlin acquired an apartment in the new, upscale Waldorf-Astoria hotel/apartment complex in the center of Jerusalem at a cost of 40 million shekels (approximately US$11.5 million). ==Writings== Nevzlin is the author of the two books “Человек с рублем” (“Man with a Ruble,” coauthored with Mikhail Khodorkovsky), in praise of free-market economics, and “Public Relations – кому это надо?” (“Public Relations – Who Needs Them?”). == See also == * Vladimir Petukhov * * David E.

These shantytowns are euphemistically called asentamientos (\\"settlements\\") or villas de emergencia (\\"emergency villages\\"). In most parts of Argentina, the non- modified word villa usually refers to a villa miseria. ==Informal settlements== These settlements consist of small houses or shacks made of tin, wood and other scrap material. Generally, the streets are not paved and narrow internal passages connect the different parts. The villas miseria have no sanitation system, though there may be water pipes passing through the settlement. Electric power is sometimes taken directly from the grid using illegal connections, which are accepted by suppliers. The villas range from small groups of precarious houses to larger, more organized communities with thousands of residents. In rural areas, the houses in the villas miserias might be made of mud and wood. Villas miseria are found around and inside the large cities of Buenos Aires, Rosario, Córdoba and Mendoza, among others. The villas draw people from several backgrounds. Some are local citizens who have fallen from an already precarious economic position. In most cases, a villa miseria is populated by the children and grandchildren of the original settlers, who have been unable to improve their economic status. ==Statistics== Improvised football match in a FONAVI development in Villa Lugano, Buenos Aires. The agency has put up over a million housing units since 1972. According to July 2004 estimates, there were about 640 \\"precarious neighborhoods\\" in suburban Buenos Aires, comprising 690,000 residents and 111,000 households. The population of the villas miseria in the city of Buenos Aires doubled during the 1990s, reaching about 120,000 as of 2005. By 2011, there were over 500,000 people living in more than 800 informal settlements around the periphery of Buenos Aires. Research from an NGO called 'A roof for my country' (UTPMP) found that of these settlements, 66% had been founded in the last fifteen years and 65% were still growing. Most slums (85%) had no sewage facilities and a similar percentage had no access to gas. The Government's statistics agency (INDEC) announced in 2016 that 8.8 million people, or 32.2% of the population, was living in poverty. This was a dramatic leap in numbers from the 4.7% people living in poverty just three years before. The non-profit TECHO estimated there more than 1,000 informal settlements in greater Buenos Aires in 2015. It stated that only 10% of villas had access to running water and 5% to sewage infrastructure. ==Programs== Attempting to address the housing problem, de facto President Alejandro Lanusse established the National Housing Fund (FONAVI) in 1972. An amalgam of long-standing national housing programs and lending facilities previously managed by the National Mortgage Bank, the FONAVI helped coordinate slum clearance efforts and, since then, has put up over 25,000 housing units a year (both single-family and multi-family types). Granting deeds on a lease-to-own basis, the fund mostly provides for households in Argentina's lowest income bracket and, thus, has historically had a collection rate of less than five per cent. The fund, one of the most important in Latin America, is largely underwritten by national fuel and other excise taxes. The military junta which ruled Argentina between 1974 and 1983 in the Dirty War attempted to destroy the informal slums by forcibly resettling people, which only succeeded in moving the villas miseria to new locations. More recently, Mayor of Buenos Aires Horacio Rodriguez Larreta intends to regularize all the informal settlements by 2023. ==Villa 1-11-14== Villa 1-11-14 is an informal settlement in the Flores area of Buenos Aires of about 70,000 people. The average age is 24 years, compared to 40 elsewhere in the city. Some streets are controlled by drug-dealing gangs. ==Villa 31== Villa 31 in Buenos Aires Villa 31 is a large villa miseria in Buenos Aires, close to Retiro railway station. It dates from the 1930s and in 2017 had around 40,000 inhabitants. The city council plans to renovate the area by 2020, by improving housing, offering the opportunity for people to become home owners and connecting electricity, water and sewage facilities. The $320 million plan, financed by the World Bank and the Inter- American Development Bank, aimed to resettle squatters into 1,350 new homes. At least 30% of the residents were concerned that they would not be rehoused. ==In culture== Mundo Villa is a TV station, a radio channel (Mundo Sur), a magazine issued monthly and a website. It is an independent media project which aims to provide villa miseria inhabitants with a voice and also to supply them with quality news. Adam Ledezma, a community activist from Villa 31, was keen to have a local newspaper and helped the project with villa-based journalism until he was murdered in 2010. Inspired by Mundo Villa, another new magazine La Garganta Poderosa ('The Mighty Throat') was set up in 2011. Argentinian painter Antonio Berni dealt with the hardships of living in a villa miseria through his series Juanito Laguna, a slum child, and Ramona Montiel, a prostitute. César Aira published his novel La Villa in 2001 (released in English translation in 2013 as Shantytown). In it he examines the invisibility of slumdwellers. The Argentinian writer Hugo Pezzini comments on the book: \\"The apparent absurdity of César Aira's novel La Villa provides an instance of resourceful mediation to semantically reorganize a situation of emergency and locate it within its particular rationale. In Argentina, a slum is popularly called 'villa miseria,' or simply 'la villa.' In politically correct language, that is, officially, is called 'villa de emergencia.'” ==See also== * Favela (Brazil) * Pueblos jóvenes (Peru) * Cantegril * Barrios * Colonia (border settlement) * Poverty * Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002) * Economy of Argentina ==References== ==External links== * El derecho a la vivienda en Argentina, Informe misión de investigación, Centre of Housing Rights and Evictions, 2004.

Governor Deane C. Davis appointed a study commission in 1969 to develop a statewide law to address these concerns, as no environmental regulations or land use controls existed. A major contributor to the construction of the law was Laura G. Wheeler, in consultation with then Vermont Attorney General James Jeffords. ==The law== The law created nine District Environmental Commissions10 V.S.A. § 6026 to review large-scale development projects using 10 criteria that are designed to safeguard the environment, community life, and aesthetic character of the state. They have the power to issue or deny a permit to real estate developers for any project that encompasses more than 10 acres (40,000 m2), or more than one acre (4,000 m2) for towns that do not have permanent zoning and subdivision bylaws. The law also applies to any development project with more than 10 housing units or housing lots; and may also apply for construction proposed above of elevation. Act 250 also created the Vermont Environmental Board to review appeals coming from District Commission rulings. ===District Commissions=== The district commissions are: * District 1: Rutland County * District 2: Windham and southern Windsor County * District 3: northern Windsor County and Orange counties * District 4: Chittenden County * District 5: Washington and Lamoille counties * District 6: Franklin and Grand Isle counties * District 7: Caledonia, Orleans and Essex counties * District 8: Bennington County * District 9: Addison County === Ten Criteria === The 10 Criteria are as follows: # Will not result in undue water or air pollution. Included are the following considerations: (A) Headwaters; (B) Waste disposal (including wastewater and stormwater); (C) Water Conservation; (D) Floodways; (E) Streams; (F) Shorelines; and (G) Wetlands. # Has sufficient water available for the needs of the subdivision or development. # Will not unreasonably burden any existing water supply. # Will not cause unreasonable soil erosion or affect the capacity of the land to hold water. # Will not cause unreasonably dangerous or congested conditions with respect to highways or other means of transportation. # Will not create an unreasonable burden on the educational facilities of the municipality. # Will not create an unreasonable burden on the municipality in providing governmental services. # Will not have an undue adverse effect on aesthetics, scenic beauty, historic sites or natural areas, and 8(A) will not imperil necessary wildlife habitat or endangered species in the immediate area. # Conforms with the Capability and Development Plan which includes the following considerations: (A) The impact the project will have on the growth of the town or region: (B) Primary agricultural soils; (C) Productive forest soils; (D) Earth resources; (E) Extraction of earth resources; (F) Energy conservation; (G) Private utility services; (H) Costs of scattered developments; (J) Public utility services; (K) Development affecting public investments; and (L) Rural growth areas. # Is in conformance with any local or regional plan or capital facilities program. The 10 criteria have changed little since the adoption of Act 250 in 1970. Efforts have been made over the years to make the permitting process work more efficiently, along with performance standards. Today, the District Commissions receive between 600 and 800 applications per year, and hold hearings on an average of 20% of these.

Act 250 jurisdiction attaches forever to permits, except to permits for quarries and logging at elevations over . These permits are allowed to close when the work required to complete them is complete. There is not sufficient funding to support personnel to verify proper completion of the required activity, so the Act 250 office must rely on the permit applicant to truthfully verify completion. Act 250 creators included Laura G. Wheeler of Barre Town, Vermont; then Attorney General James Jeffords, Howard Rusk of New York; Jeanne Garvin of Montpelier, Vermont; and Lawrence Gurnette of Michigan. The intent of the Act was to create a more esthetic Vermont by protecting rivers, air, the forest's ability to support wildlife, and to preserve Vermont's natural resources. One concern was forest conservation, and the prevention of excessive clear cutting. ==Controversy== The law has been controversial since its implementation. It is often costly to implement restrictions placed on commercial projects. In his 2002 gubernatorial campaign, Governor Jim Douglas ran on a platform that included restructuring Act 250. ==20th century== In 1993, Vermont was designated one of America's most \\"Endangered Historic Places\\" by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. ==See also== * United States energy law * Green Up Day ==Notes== ==External links and sources== * ACT 250: A Guide to Vermont's Land Use Law.

He was a Justice of the Peace for Hampshire and Nottinghamshire and the Deputy Lieutenant for Nottinghamshire. He was also a Knight of Grace of the Order of St John. == Early life == Seely was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, the eldest son of Sir Charles Seely, 1st Baronet (1833–1915), an industrialist and major land- owner in both Nottinghamshire and the Isle of Wight. Cites: He was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, and inherited the family estates at Sherwood Lodge in Nottinghamshire, and Gatcombe in the Isle of Wight. == Political career == Seely was a Liberal Unionist for the early part of his political career. He first stood for election to Parliament at the 1886 general election, when he unsuccessfully contested Mid Derbyshire. He stood for Rushcliffe at the 1892 election without success, but won a seat in Lincoln at the 1895 election, which his grandfather Charles Seely had represented until 1885 as a Liberal. He was re-elected again in 1900 with Conservative backing. However, in February 1904 he lost the backing of the local Conservative and Liberal Unionist Association over his support for free trade. The Conservatives adopted Henry Page Croft as their candidate in place of Seely, who stood in the 1906 general election as a Free Trade candidate. Despite this setback, he again stood for Lincoln in the General Election of January 1910 as a Liberal Unionist in support of Free Trade and was again opposed by a Liberal and a Conservative. This time he finished in third place and did not stand for Parliament again for another six years. He instead served as High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire for 1912. He was the successful Liberal Party candidate at a by-election in September 1916 in the Mansfield division of Nottinghamshire. At the 1918 general election, after boundary changes, he stood in the new Broxtowe division of Nottinghamshire, but the seat was won with a large majority by the Labour Party candidate.

It is a jargon rather than an actual language; it consists of a significant number of unique specialized words, but does not have its own grammar or its own basic vocabulary. Yenish speakers generally speak their local German dialect, enriched by the Yeniche vocabulary, which is derived in part from Rotwelsch, with influences from Yiddish, Romani, and other minority languages of the region. The Yenish vocabulary contains many words of Romani and Yiddish (and through this route, Hebrew) origin; it also has many unusual metaphors and metonomies that replace the standard German words. The relationship between Yenish and standard German is comparable to the relationship between Cockney or Polari and standard English. Some original Yeniche words have become parts of standard German. The Yenish were originally travelers, i.e. people with professions outside of mainstream society that required them to move from town to town, such as showpeople, tinkers, and door-to-door salesmen. Today, the Yenish jargon is only used in certain isolated locations, such as certain poor districts of Berlin, Münster, some Eifel villages, and Luxembourg.

Admiral Briscoe graduated from the United States Naval Academy in June 1918. During World War I he served on the battleship USS Alabama (BB-8) of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet and on the destroyer USS Roe (DD-24), operating from Brest, France. At the end of hostilities, he made the first postwar Midshipmen cruise in the USS Kearsarge (BB-5) and in 1919 returned to destroyer duty as engineer officer of the USS Humphreys (DD-236), stationed in Near East waters at Constantinople. During the Turko-Greek fighting in 1920–1921, he commanded a naval landing force at Derindge, Turkey.

He has been identified as one of the pioneers of modern electronics development in the Navy. === World War II === In May 1942, he assumed command of the USS Prometheus (AR-3), a recommissioned World War I repair ship. Under his command, she joined the U.S. 3rd Fleet at Noumea, New Caledonia, where he was detached to command Destroyer Squadron 5 and operated as escort commander for Task Forces 67, 68 and 70. In the intervening periods when the battleships and cruisers were not at sea, Admiral Briscoe operated Commander Task Group 675 (Cactus Striking Force) in Guadalcanal waters. He was transferred to command of the USS Denver (CL-58) in July 1943 and was in command during the Northern Solomon Islands campaign. During a thirty-six-hour battle with Japanese naval forces, his ship assisted in the sinking of five enemy warships, damaging four others and routing the enemy's surface forces. His ship's guns had barely fired their last salvo when she was attacked by sixty-seven dive bombers. Under his command, the ship downed seventeen enemy planes and thwarted the raid. He sailed the cruiser to the United States after she suffered severe battle damage off Rabaul in November 1943. In February 1944, he joined the staff of the Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet, in Washington, D.C., as head of New Developments, and with his promotion to flag rank in April 1945, assumed command of Amphibious Group 14.

Ordered in January 1952 to command the U.S. 7th Fleet in Korean waters, he retained this command until designated Commander Naval Forces, Far East, in June of that year. During this tenure, he recommended an amphibious feint to draw North Korean combatants from their dug-in front line positions to cover potential landing zones. This resulted in a significant shift of troop concentrations by enemy forces over a period of three months. Two years later, he reported as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, for Fleet Operations and Readiness, and on 2 July 1956, became Commander in Chief, Allied Forces, Southern Europe. === Decorations and awards === *60px Navy Cross for actions in the Northern Solomon Islands campaign. *60px Army Distinguished Service Medal for his service as Senior Commander of all naval forces in the Far East Command, June 4, 1952 to March 31, 1954. *60px Navy Distinguished Service Medal in his capacity as CinC of Allied Forces, Southern Europe from July 2, 1956, to December 31, 1958. *60px Legion of Merit for January 19 – February 1, 1943, Guadalcanal and a Gold Star in lieu of a second award of the Legion of Merit with Combat \\"V\\" for March 5 – 6, 1943 as Commander of Task Group 68.5, Solomon Islands. == Civilian life == On January 1, 1959, he was transferred to the Retired List of the United States Navy.

Lord Sherwood was a member of a family of politicians, industrialists and significant landowners. His great-grandfather Charles Seely (1803–1887), grandfather Sir Charles Seely, 1st Baronet, father Sir Charles Seely, 2nd Baronet, and uncle John Edward Bernard Seely, 1st Baron Mottistone were all Members of Parliament. ==See also== *Seely baronets ==References== ==Further reading== *Burke's Peerage and Baronetage 107th Edition Volume III [ *Burke's Peerage and Baronetage 107th Edition Volume III *Information on the Seely family estates at the UK National Registry of Archives *Wight Life April/May 1975 article on The Seely Family and their Island Homes *The Great Houses of Nottinghamshire, Sherwood Lodge (1881) *Correspondence with Winston Churchill == External links == * Sherwood, Hugh Seely, 1st Baron Sherwood, Hugh Seely, 1st Baron Sherwood, Hugh Seely, 1st Baron Category:Grenadier Guards officers Category:High Sheriffs of Nottinghamshire Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Ministers in the Churchill wartime government, 1940–1945 Category:People educated at Eton College Category:People from Calverton, Nottinghamshire Hugh Category:UK MPs 1923–1924 Category:UK MPs 1935–1945 Category:UK MPs who were granted peerages ","title":"Hugh Seely, 1st Baron Sherwood"},{"id":"2234982","text":"A message-waiting indicator (MWI) in telephony, is a Telcordia Technologies (formerly Bellcore) term for an FSK-based telephone calling feature that illuminates an LED on selected telephones to notify a telephone user of waiting voicemail messages on most North American public telephone networks and PBXs. As described in Telcordia Generic Requirements document GR-283-CORE, a Message_Waiting_Indicator (MWI) is a mechanism that informs the subscriber about the status of recorded messages. The subscriber may subscribe to a notification feature that makes use of the status of this MWI. ==Difference to audible message waiting indicators== This feature is also frequently called (and abbreviated) as visual message waiting indicator (VMWI). A VMWI, as defined in Telcordia GR-1401-CORE, is a stored program controlled switching (SPCS) system feature that activates and deactivates a visual indicator on customer-premises equipment (CPE) to notify the customer that new messages are waiting. VMWI differs from existing features that use other message indicators, such as audible stuttered dial tone, in that it activates a visual indicator on the CPE. The visual indicator may be as simple as lighting or flashing a light-emitting diode (LED), or as advanced as displaying a special message on a liquid-crystal display (LCD). This technology was invented by Jerome (Jerry) Schull and Wayne Howe at BellSouth's Advanced Technology R&D; group in 1992 and was issued as US Patents #5,363,431 and #5,521,964. It was introduced in 1995, with the introduction of CLASS-based calling features and ADSI. It was at one time only compatible with ADSI-compliant telephones but is now compatible with any customer premises equipment (CPE) that simply responds visually to visual FSK. ==Use of similar indicator on standalone Caller ID set-top boxes== This service is often erroneously associated with the abilities of most Caller ID standalone set-top boxes. Caller ID boxes manufactured after 1998 feature an LED that blinks green to notify that new calls have been recorded and red to indicate that a subscriber has new voicemail messages waiting. Some units also display the text \\"MESSAGE WAITING\\" (similar to ADSI-compliant telephones). These units do not use visual FSK to activate their red LEDs, but instead, they briefly \\"pick-up\\" the line at certain intervals (normally, within two minutes of a new call) to check for a \\"stuttered\\" dial tone. The presence of a stutter dial tone activates a red LED; while absence deactivates it. ==Mobile telephony== For mobile phones, the message-waiting indicator is sent via a Short Message Service (SMS) message — the same system used for texting. (SMS was actually invented for utilitarian uses like this, not for user conversation.) It not only indicates that a message is waiting, but also how many unheard messages there are on the voicemail server for that telephone number. In the event that a phone is deactivated, out of range, or otherwise removed from the network, there is often no way to clear this indicator until another message is recorded to the system, causing the MWI message to be sent again once the phone reconnects. The customer service call center for the mobile network operator may also be able to provide simple technical support to reset this by resending the MWI message manually.

A zome in the original sense is a building using unusual geometrieshttp://www.cyberarchi.com/actus&dossiers;/logement- individuel/index.php?dossier=69&article;=2896 (different from the standard house or other building which is essentially one or a series of rectangular boxes). The word \\"zome\\" was coined in 1968 by Steve Durkee, now known as Nooruddeen Durkee, combining the words dome and zonohedron. One of the earliest models ended up as a large climbing structure at the Lama Foundation. In the second sense as a learning tool or toy, \\"Zometool\\" refers to a model- construction toy manufactured by Zometool, Inc.Zometool, Inc. It is sometimes thought of as the ultimate form of the \\"ball and stick\\" construction toy, in form. It appeals to adults as well as children, and is educational on many levels (not the least, geometry). Finally, the term \\"Zome system\\" refers to the mathematics underlying the physical construction system. Both the building and the learning tool are the brainchildren of inventor/designer Steve Baer, his wife, Holly, and associates. == As building concept == Following his education at Amherst College and UCLA, Steve Baer studied mathematics at Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (Zurich, Switzerland). Here he became interested in the possibilities of building innovative structures using polyhedra. Baer and his wife, Holly, moved back to the U.S., settling in Albuquerque, New Mexico in the early 1960s. In New Mexico, he experimented with constructing buildings of unusual geometries (calling them by his friend Steve Durkee's term: \\"zomes\\" — see \\"Drop City\\") — buildings intended to be appropriate to their environment, notably to utilize solar energy well. Baer was fascinated with the dome geometry popularized by architect R. Buckminster Fuller. Baer was an occasional guest at Drop City, an arts and experimental community near Trinidad, CO. He wanted to design and construct buildings that didn't suffer from some of the limitations of the smaller, owner-built versions of geodesic domes (of the 'pure Fuller' design). In recent years, the unconventional \\"zome\\" building-design approach with its multi-faceted geometric lines has been taken up by French builders in the Pyrenees. Home Work, a book published in 2004 and edited by Lloyd Kahn, has a section featuring these buildings. While many zomes built in the last couple decades have been wood-framed and made use of wood sheathing, much of what Baer himself originally designed and constructed involved metal framing with a sheet-metal outer skin. Zomes have also been used in the artistic, sculptural, and furniture areas. Zomadic, based in San Francisco, CA and founded by Rob Bell, incorporates zome geometry into artistic structures constructed primarily from CNC machined plywood components. Bell is a frequent attendee at Burning Man, a yearly artistic showcase event located in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada. Richie Duncan of Kodama Zomes, based in southern Oregon has invented a structural system based on a hanging zome geometry, suspended from an overhead anchor point. Constructed of metal compressive elements and webbing tensile elements, the structures are able to be assembled and disassembled. This suspended zome system has been used in furniture, performing arts, and treehouse applications. Yann Lipnick of Zomadic Concepts in France has an extensive study of, and multiple project construction of zomes in many different materials. He highlights the universal appeal and healing atmosphere that zomes provide, and has training classes and reference books on zome construction. == Construction set == Zometool logo Great Grand Stellated 120-Cell modeled in Zometool The Zometool plastic construction set is produced by a privately owned company of the same name, based outside of Boulder, Colorado, and which evolved out of Baer's company ZomeWorks. It is perhaps best described as a \\"space-frame construction set\\". Its elements consist of small connector nodes and struts of various colors. The overall shape of a connector node is that of a non-uniform small rhombicosidodecahedron, except that each face is replaced by a small hole. The ends of the struts are designed to fit in the holes of the connector nodes, allowing for syntheses of a variety of structures. The idea of shape-coding the three types of struts was developed by Marc Pelletier and Paul Hildebrandt. To create the \\"balls,\\" or nodes, Pelletier and Hildebrandt invented a system of 62 hydraulic pins that came together to form a mold. The first connector node emerged from their mold perfectly on April 1, 1992. These parts are made from state-of-the-art ABS plastic injection-mold technology. In the years since 1992, Zometool has widened and enriched its line of products. Much of the development has focused on improving the style or the variety of struts available. Since 1992, the basic design of the connector node has not changed, and hence the various parts released have remained universally compatible. From 1992 until 2000, Zometool produced many kits which included connector nodes and blue, yellow, and red struts. In 2000, Zometool introduced green lines created in France by the architect Fabien VienneFabien Vienne, which were designed to allow the user to build, among other things, models of the regular tetrahedron and octahedron. In 2003, Zometool changed the style of the struts slightly. The struts \\"with clicks\\" have a different surface texture and they also have longer nibs which allow for a more robust connection between connector node and strut. === Characteristics of Zometool === The color of a Zometool strut is associated with its cross section and also with the shape of the hole of the connector node in which it fits. Each blue strut has a rectangular cross section, each yellow strut has a triangular cross section, and each red strut has a pentagonal cross section. The cross section of a green strut is a rhombus, where the ratio of the diagonals is √2. The green struts, fitting in the \\"red\\" pentagonal holes, are not a part of the 1992 release of Zometool, and, consequently, using them is not as straightforward as the other colors. One may find a variety of colors of connector nodes, but these all have the same purpose and design. At their midpoints, each of the yellow and red struts has an apparent twist. At these points, the cross-sectional shape reverses. This design feature forces the connector nodes on the ends of the strut to have the same orientation. Similarly, the cross section of the blue strut is a non-square rectangle, again ensuring that the two nodes on the ends have the same orientation. Instead of a twist, the green struts have two bends which allow them to fit into the pentagonal holes of the connector node. Among other places, the word Zome comes from the term zone. The Zome system allows no more than 61 zones. The cross-sectional shapes correspond to colors, and in turn these correspond to zone colors. Hence the Zome system has 15 blue zones, 10 yellow zones, 6 red zones, and 30 green zones. Two shapes are associated with blue. The blue struts with a rectangular cross section are designed to lie in the same zones as the blue struts, but they are half the length of a blue strut; hence these struts are often called \\"half-blue\\" (and were originally made in a light blue color). The blue-green struts with a rhombic cross section lie in the same zones as the green struts, but they are designed so that the ratio of a rhombic blue-green strut to a blue strut is 1:1 (as opposed to the green strut's √2:1). It is important to understand that, due to this length ratio, the blue-green struts having a rhombic cross section do not mathematically belong to the Zome system. == A definition of the Zome system == Here is a mathematical definition of the Zome system, on which the physical Zometool construction set is based. It is defined in terms of the vector space R^3, equipped with the standard inner product, also known as 3-dimensional Euclidean space. Let \\\\varphi denote the Golden ratio and let H_3 denote the symmetry group of the configuration of vectors (0,\\\\pm\\\\varphi,\\\\pm 1), (\\\\pm\\\\varphi,\\\\pm 1,0), and (\\\\pm 1,0,\\\\pm\\\\varphi). The group H_3, an example of a Coxeter group, is known as the icosahedral group because it is the symmetry group of a regular icosahedron having these vectors as its vertices. The subgroup of H_3 consisting of the elements with determinant 1 (i.e. the rotations) is isomorphic to A_5. Define the \\"standard blue vectors\\" as the A_5-orbit of the vector (2,0,0). Define the \\"standard yellow vectors\\" as the A_5-orbit of the vector (1,1,1). Define the \\"standard red vectors\\" as the A_5-orbit of the vector (0,\\\\varphi,1). A \\"strut\\" of the Zome System is any vector which can be obtained from the standard vectors described above by scaling by any power \\\\varphi^n, where n is an integer. A \\"node\\" of the Zome System is any element of the subgroup of R^3 generated by the struts. Finally, the \\"Zome system\\" is the set of all pairs (N,S), where N is a set of nodes and S is a set of pairs (v,w) such that v and w are in N and the difference v-w is a strut. One may check that there are 30, 20, and 12 standard vectors having the colors blue, yellow, and red, respectively. Correspondingly, the stabilizer subgroup of a blue, yellow, or red strut is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, 3, or 5, respectively. Hence, one may also describe the blue, yellow, and red struts as \\"rectangular\\", \\"triangular\\", and \\"pentagonal\\", respectively. One may extend the Zome system by adjoining green vectors. The \\"standard green vectors\\" comprise the A_5-orbit of the vector (2,2,0). and a \\"green strut\\" as any vector which can be obtained by scaling a standard green vector by any integral power \\\\varphi^n. As above, one may check that there are A_5=60 standard green vectors. One may then enhance the Zome system by including these green struts. Doing this does not affect the set of nodes. The abstract Zome system defined above is significant because of the following fact: Every connected Zome model has a faithful image in the Zome system. The converse of this fact is only partially true, but this is due only to the laws of physics. For example, the radius of a Zometool node is positive (as opposed to a node being a single point mathematically), so one cannot make a Zometool model where two nodes are separated by an arbitrarily small prescribed distance. Similarly, only a finite number of lengths of struts will ever be manufactured, and a green strut cannot be placed directly adjacent to a red strut or another green strut with which it shares the same hole (even though they are mathematically distinct). == Zome as a modeling system == Compound of five cubes, rendered in ZomeCAD Compound of five tetrahedra, rendered in vZome The Zome system is especially good at modeling 1-dimensional skeleta of highly symmetric objects in 3- and 4-dimensional Euclidean space. The most prominent among these are the five Platonic solids, and the 4-dimensional polytopes related to the 120-cell and the 600-cell. However, the list of mathematical objects which are amenable to Zome is long, and an exhaustive list is not forthcoming. Besides those already mentioned, one may use Zome to model the following mathematical objects: * Three of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra * Regular polyhedral compounds * Regular 4-dimensional polytopes and some compounds * Many stellations of the rhombic triacontahedron * Many stellations of the regular icosahedron * Zonohedra, especially the rhombic enneacontahedron and rhombic triacontahedron * Hypercubes in dimensions 61 or fewer * Most uniform polyhedra (a major exception being those formed using the snub operation) * Many uniform 4-polytopes * Thorold Gosset's exceptional semiregular polytopes in 6, 7, and 8 dimensions * A few of the Johnson solids * Desargues configuration * Two of the Catalan solids * Classical and exceptional root systems * Triality (from Lie theory) == Other uses of Zome == The uses of Zome are not restricted to pure mathematics. Other uses include the study of engineering problems, especially steel-truss structures, the study of some molecular, nanotube, and viral structures, and to make soap film surfaces. == References == * Steve Baer.

WKYS is licensed by the FCC to broadcast using HD Radio. The station simulcasts the Urban Talk programming of sister station WOL on its HD2 subchannel. Sputnik Radio English programming is broadcast on its HD3 subchannel. ==History== The station was first launched as WRC-FM in June 1947 alongside its television partner, WRC-TV channel 4 (originally as WNBW). Both were built from the ground up by NBC, which launched WRC 980 AM 24 years earlier. It inherited the call sign from its AM radio partner based on RCA's ownership of the network. During its early days, it carried a jazz format. The transition from the beautiful music format into what is now WKYS occurred when NBC moved the Top 40 format that was on sister station WRC/980 to WKYS to make way for an all-news format on the AM station. For a short time in 1975, the two stations simulcast the Top 40 format. Shortly after the simulcast was discontinued, the original AM Top 40 format continued for a short while on the FM station, but later, seeing the coming boom in disco music, WKYS adopted a highly successful disco format in the late 1970s and branded itself as WKYS, \\"Disco 93.9\\". DJs during the disco era included Donnie Simpson, Jack Harris, Stoney Richards, Joe Cipriano, Eddie Edwards, Barry \\"Reazar\\" Richards, Bill Bailey, Jeff Leonard, Chuck Davis, Candy Shannon and Max Kinkel. The disco format eventually evolved into the present urban contemporary format, WKYS, \\"93.9 Kiss FM\\" under the guidance of Donnie Simpson. In the mid-1980s, WKYS gained competition from WMMJ and WPGC. While that caused a setback in its dominance, WKYS did not suffer a huge of a threat to its ratings and audience share even as it had to rank behind the competition, including WHUR-FM which converted its jazz format to urban AC in 1993. (The D.C. radio market is one of the very few markets to have multiple urban stations on the FM dial for a long time.) When NBC divested all of its radio properties in 1988, WKYS was sold to Albimar Communications. Some years later, amid financial difficulties, the station was sold to Radio One. In the mid-1990s, WKYS was forced to drop the \\"Kiss FM\\" name and changed it to \\"93.9 WKYS\\" due to Clear Channel acquiring the rights to the branding itself and enforcing the trademark rights nationwide. However, WKYS reintroduced the \\"Kiss FM\\" name for a period of time years after with its over-the-air branding, though Clear Channel did not make further claims of legal action. WKYS, however, retired the \\"Kiss FM\\" moniker later on and simply called itself \\"93.9 WKYS\\". ===Shows=== From 1977 to 1993, WKYS was home to radio personality Donnie Simpson. The station was also once the flagship of the nationally syndicated Russ Parr Morning Show.

The wind ensemble is the higher- level band group, while the lower-level group is the concert band. The two bands have two concerts throughout the year; the winter concert, and the spring concert. The winter concert is late November, while the spring concert is mid-April. The marching band, consisting of the members of wind ensemble, performs at all of the varsity football team's home games throughout the season. When the football team has an away game, the marching band creates a \\"pep-band\\" and travels to the opposing team's stadium to support the team. The marching band performs at other various school activities, such as leading the homecoming parade and playing at the pep-rallies. The jazz ensemble is showcased in multiple concerts and performances throughout the year. A few of the showcases include the jazz concert in mid-October, another jazz concert in early February, and the Jazz Cabaret in May. ==The Paw Print== The Paw Print is an independent publication of Wilde Lake High School. ==Notable alumni== *Zach Brown (class of 2007) – American football player, free agent *David Bentley Hart (class of 1982) – theologian and cultural critic *Isaiah Coulter - attended freshman through junior year *Dr. Terri L.

S., \\"[On Junctures and Fractures in Logic]\\" (editors' title for MS 427 (the new numbering system), Fall–Winter 1882), and \\"Letter, Peirce to O. H.

(1997), \\"Matching Logical Structure to Linguistic Structure\\", Studies in the Logic of Charles Sanders Peirce, Nathan Houser, Don D. Roberts, and James Van Evra, editors, Bloomington and Indianopolis: Indiana University Press, pp. 418–444, see 420, 425, 426, 428. and continued to develop the method until his death in 1914. ==The graphs== Peirce proposed three systems of existential graphs: * alpha, isomorphic to sentential logic and the two-element Boolean algebra; * beta, isomorphic to first-order logic with identity, with all formulas closed; * gamma, (nearly) isomorphic to normal modal logic. Alpha nests in beta and gamma. Beta does not nest in gamma, quantified modal logic being more general than put forth by Peirce. ===Alpha=== Alpha graphs The syntax is: *The blank page; *Single letters or phrases written anywhere on the page; *Any graph may be enclosed by a simple closed curve called a cut or sep. A cut can be empty. Cuts can nest and concatenate at will, but must never intersect. Any well- formed part of a graph is a subgraph. The semantics are: *The blank page denotes Truth; *Letters, phrases, subgraphs, and entire graphs may be True or False; *To enclose a subgraph with a cut is equivalent to logical negation or Boolean complementation. Hence an empty cut denotes False; *All subgraphs within a given cut are tacitly conjoined. Hence the alpha graphs are a minimalist notation for sentential logic, grounded in the expressive adequacy of And and Not. The alpha graphs constitute a radical simplification of the two-element Boolean algebra and the truth functors. The depth of an object is the number of cuts that enclose it. Rules of inference: *Insertion - Any subgraph may be inserted into an odd numbered depth. *Erasure - Any subgraph in an even numbered depth may be erased. Rules of equivalence: *Double cut - A pair of cuts with nothing between them may be drawn around any subgraph. Likewise two nested cuts with nothing between them may be erased. This rule is equivalent to Boolean involution. *Iteration/Deiteration – To understand this rule, it is best to view a graph as a tree structure having nodes and ancestors. Any subgraph P in node n may be copied into any node depending on n. Likewise, any subgraph P in node n may be erased if there exists a copy of P in some node ancestral to n (i.e., some node on which n depends). For an equivalent rule in an algebraic context, see C2 in Laws of Form. A proof manipulates a graph by a series of steps, with each step justified by one of the above rules. If a graph can be reduced by steps to the blank page or an empty cut, it is what is now called a tautology (or the complement thereof). Graphs that cannot be simplified beyond a certain point are analogues of the satisfiable formulas of first-order logic. ===Beta=== Peirce notated predicates using intuitive English phrases; the standard notation of contemporary logic, capital Latin letters, may also be employed. A dot asserts the existence of some individual in the domain of discourse. Multiple instances of the same object are linked by a line, called the \\"line of identity\\". There are no literal variables or quantifiers in the sense of first-order logic. A line of identity connecting two or more predicates can be read as asserting that the predicates share a common variable. The presence of lines of identity requires modifying the alpha rules of Equivalence. The beta graphs can be read as a system in which all formula are to be taken as closed, because all variables are implicitly quantified. If the \\"shallowest\\" part of a line of identity has even (odd) depth, the associated variable is tacitly existentially (universally) quantified. Zeman (1964) was the first to note that the beta graphs are isomorphic to first-order logic with equality (also see Zeman 1967). However, the secondary literature, especially Roberts (1973) and Shin (2002), does not agree on just how this is so. Peirce's writings do not address this question, because first-order logic was first clearly articulated only some years after his death, in the 1928 first edition of David Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann's Principles of Mathematical Logic. ===Gamma=== Add to the syntax of alpha a second kind of simple closed curve, written using a dashed rather than a solid line. Peirce proposed rules for this second style of cut, which can be read as the primitive unary operator of modal logic. Zeman (1964) was the first to note that straightforward emendations of the gamma graph rules yield the well-known modal logics S4 and S5. Hence the gamma graphs can be read as a peculiar form of normal modal logic. This finding of Zeman's has gone unremarked to this day, but is nonetheless included here as a point of interest. ==Peirce's role== The existential graphs are a curious offspring of Peirce the logician/mathematician with Peirce the founder of a major strand of semiotics. Peirce's graphical logic is but one of his many accomplishments in logic and mathematics. In a series of papers beginning in 1867, and culminating with his classic paper in the 1885 American Journal of Mathematics, Peirce developed much of the two-element Boolean algebra, propositional calculus, quantification and the predicate calculus, and some rudimentary set theory. Model theorists consider Peirce the first of their kind. He also extended De Morgan's relation algebra. He stopped short of metalogic (which eluded even Principia Mathematica). But Peirce's evolving semiotic theory led him to doubt the value of logic formulated using conventional linear notation, and to prefer that logic and mathematics be notated in two (or even three) dimensions. His work went beyond Euler's diagrams and Venn's 1880 revision thereof. Frege's 1879 Begriffsschrift also employed a two-dimensional notation for logic, but one very different from Peirce's. Peirce's first published paper on graphical logic (reprinted in Vol. 3 of his Collected Papers) proposed a system dual (in effect) to the alpha existential graphs, called the entitative graphs. He very soon abandoned this formalism in favor of the existential graphs. In 1911 Victoria, Lady Welby showed the Existential graphs to C. K. Ogden who felt they could usefully be combined with Welby's thoughts in a \\"less abstruse form. Otherwise they attracted little attention during his life and were invariably denigrated or ignored after his death, until the Ph.D. theses by Roberts (1964) and Zeman (1964). ==See also== * Ampheck * Conceptual graph * Entitative graph * Logical graph ==References== ==Further readingPrimary literature=== *1931–1935 & 1958\\\\.

Known as the \\"Official Theatre of the State of Ohio\\", the historic 1928 movie palace was saved from demolition in 1969 and completely restored. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1977 as one of the nation's finest surviving grand theaters. The Ohio Theatre is owned and operated by the non-profit arts management organization CAPA (The Columbus Association for the Performing Arts), which was originally formed to save the theater in 1969. ==HistoryLoew's Ohio=== Located in Downtown Columbus on the site of the old Columbus City Hall, the Ohio Theatre was designed by the noted theatre architect Thomas W. Lamb. Of all of the theaters he designed, he noted the Ohio as one of his most successful. He intended to separate patrons from their daily lives by creating a luxurious fantasy atmosphere inside. It was decorated and furnished by New York designer Anne Dornin. Each room had a theme. Dornin's favorite was the \\"Africa Corner\\" which she decorated with authentic pieces from her travels. The theatre also featured lavish men's and women's lounge areas including separate smoking and telephone rooms. Built by the Loew's theater chain in partnership with United Artists the 2,779 (originally 3,096) seat Spanish Baroque movie palace opened on March 17, 1928. The first film shown was The Divine Woman, a silent film with Greta Garbo. The Ohio featured its own orchestra and Robert-Morton theatre organ (still in use today). In addition to movies, deluxe variety shows graced the stage, with performers that included Fred Waring, Milton Berle, Ray Bolger, Buddy Ebsen, Ginger Rogers, Conrad Nagel, and Jack Benny. Sound films were introduced at Loew's Ohio in August 1928. The great popularity of \\"talking pictures\\" reduced the need for theater chains to offer expensive live entertainment along with the films. Regular stage shows were discontinued in 1933 and the orchestra was disbanded. However organist Roger Garrett continued to perform daily at the \\"Mighty Morton\\" and occasional live appearances by stars including Judy Garland and Jean Harlow were featured on the stage. The theater was the premiere area showcase for the films of MGM and other studios and in the late 1930s double features became the norm. Programs ran for one week with the rare exception of huge hits like Gone with the Wind, which ran for three. During World War II, movie theaters were busier than ever and the Ohio was no exception, adding late night showings for war plant shift workers. War bonds were heavily promoted and sold in the theater's lobby. In 1944, when Roger Garrett was inducted into the army, live organ music was discontinued. In the late 1940s when television became popular, movie attendance gradually dropped as audiences lost the weekly moviegoing habit. Attendance further decreased when residents began moving from the city to the suburbs. The decreased profits led to a decreased staff and roped off seating. However the Ohio continued showing premium films until it closed. The James Bond films were especially popular for the theater in the 1960s. In 1966, members of the American Theatre Organ Society began restoring the Robert Morton and playing the organ for shows again. ===Restoration and rebirth=== Loew's closed the theater on February 24, 1969; the final film was Play Dirty with Michael Caine. A local development company called the 55 East State Company bought the property with plans to construct an office tower on the site of the Ohio and the adjacent Grand Theatre. Members of the community rallied to raise money to purchase an option to acquire the structure to gain time to raise additional funds and keep the theater open. Some of the non-essential interior items were sold to raise money to buy the property. Under the leadership of architect Robert Karlsberger and others, the non-profit Columbus Association for the Performing Arts (CAPA) was formed to raise money and develop a plan for the future of the theater. All the while live performances were held inside to raise money and give the public a chance to see the theater in use. CAPA was able to use the groundswell of popular interest in the theater to convince business and government leaders to support saving the theater. In late 1969 money was raised to purchase the Ohio and it immediately began presenting shows and concerts under the management of CAPA. These concerts included rock musicians like The Grateful Dead, Frank Zappa, and Alice Cooper. The Columbus Symphony Orchestra badly needed a permanent home and began performing at the Ohio in the fall of 1969, enjoying an increase in ticket sales thanks to excitement about the new venue. The building was completely restored to its original appearance in stages throughout the 1970s. The adjacent Grand Theatre was demolished and its lot was developed at first for parking. In 1984, the space was used to build an addition to the theatre, the Galbreath Pavilion, named for real estate developer John W. Galbreath and his wife Dorothy. The pavilion expanded lobby space and added offices and rehearsal rooms. The stage was gradually modernized to allow for large theatrical performances by adding a crossover passage, supplemental dressing rooms and an expanded orchestra pit. In the 1980s as the surrounding area was cleared for development of an urban shopping mall, CAPA obtained the rights to expand the stage, doubling its size, into the alleyway behind the theater. The theatre has also added dressing rooms and a loading dock to allow the Ohio to present large touring Broadway musicals. The Ohio Theatre was one of the earliest restorations of a movie palace for use as a performing arts center and served as a model for many later historic renovation projects in the United States. Unlike many remaining 1920s theaters designed by Lamb and others, the Ohio still very closely resembles its original appearance with few alterations. Today it is the home of the Columbus Symphony Orchestra, BalletMet, the Broadway Series, Opera Columbus, and the CAPA Summer Movie Series. ==Gallery== File:Ohio Theatre 01.jpgEntrance and marquee File:Ohio Theatre booth.jpgBox office File:Ohio Theatre (feb 2014) 3.jpgAuditorium File:Columbus, Ohio - Highsmith 23.jpgEntrance hall File:Columbus, Ohio - Highsmith 34.jpgBasement level ==See also== * List of concert halls * List of National Historic Landmarks in Ohio ==ReferencesLibrary of Congress.

The son of a labourer at Hallinan’s Flour Mills in the town, Twomey went to work there at the age of 14 where he rose to the position of works manager. In 1914 he became active in the Irish Volunteers. ==War of Independence== By 1918 he was adjutant of the Fermoy Battalion and a year later became an adjutant of the Cork No. 2 Brigade. He took part in an ambush of British troops in Fermoy in September 1919, one of the first attacks on British soldiers in Ireland since the 1916 Easter Rising and one of the first of the Irish War of Independence. During 1920 he helped direct IRA intelligence in his brigade area. He was staff commandant of Liam Lynch’s 1st Southern Division when he was captured and imprisoned on Spike Island during 1921. He managed to escape from the prison by rowing boat along with Dick Barrett, Tom Crofts and Bill Quirke. ==Civil War== Twomey opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921, although he was critical of the tactics adopted by the anti-Treaty forces headquartered in the Four Courts - he was influenced by Oscar Traynor's opinion that garrison would destroy the Republic Éireann - Dublin during June 1922.Twomey to Liam Lynch, 3 July 1922, UCDA P69/77. Liam Lynch was a figure from the old IRA, dedicated to the cause, but also determined to fight. Four Courts showed the leadership that they were out of touch with the reality of the awesome power of artillery. Although reunited in adversity, the factional splits had not masked the changing nature political changes. Twomey concurred with Liam Mellows that if a government was to be formed in the interest of labour it must be a republic.C Desmond Greaves, \\"Liam Mellows\\", p.209. During the Irish Civil War, Twomey became adjutant general on Lynch’s staff and was with the general when he was killed on the Knockmealdowns mountains in April 1923. Twomey was imprisoned in the same month in Dublin. ==IRA Chief of Staff== During 1924 he became involved in the reorganisation of the IRA, inspecting its southern divisions that summer and its northern units during 1925. First elected onto the IRA Executive at the November 1925 IRA General Army Convention, he became a full-time IRA activist. He disguised this by describing his profession as “journalist”, justified somewhat by his regular contributions to the IRA weekly newspaper, An Phoblacht. During 1926 he was acting IRA chief of staff in the absence of Andrew Cooney, and in 1927, he was confirmed in that position. In the summer of 1925, the anti-treaty IRA had sent a delegation led by Pa Murray to the Soviet Union for a personal meeting with Joseph Stalin, in the hopes of gaining Soviet finance and weaponry assistance. A secret pact was agreed where the IRA would spy on the United States and the United Kingdom and pass information to Red Army military intelligence in New York City and London in return for £500 a month. The pact was originally approved by Frank Aiken, who left soon after, before being succeeded by Cooney and Twomey who kept up the secret espionage relationship. Twomey was not himself an ideological Marxist-Leninist (though there were some communists in the IRA at this time such as Peadar O'Donnell), he saw the arrangement as purely utilitarian and regarded the Soviets as \\"shifty\\" and \\"out to exploit us.\\" Nevertheless, the IRA passed specifications of British \\"submarine detection sonar and aeroplane engines for bombers, military journals and manuals, and gas masks\\" to the Soviets. While the IRA's man in America \\"Mr. Jones\\", passed \\"reports of the army’s chemical weapons service, state-of-the-art gas masks, machine-gun and aeroplane engine specifications, and reports from the navy, air service and army\\" to the Red Army intelligence. Although not a Marxist-Leninist, Moss Twomey was considered to be a Socialist, albeit one who put practicality before ideology. Twomey's policy as Chief of Staff was to allow individual members of the IRA to join left-wing groups, but not to let the IRA itself become attached to a political party. Twomey simultaneously feared to undermine support for Fianna Fáil and thus hand power back towards Cumann na nGaedheal, but also feared the IRA being seen as attached directly to Fianna Fáil. In 1930, Twomey married Kathleen MacLaughlin of Donegal and had two children in the early 1930s. ===Saor Eire and Fianna Fáil=== the 1932 election Cumann na nGaedheal attempted to use red scare tactics by linking Fianna Fáil to the IRA, and the IRA to Communism. In 1931 Twomey tried to quell different factions within the IRA (those seeking to establish a social programme vs those against it) by permitting IRA members to create Saor Eire, a far-left political party. However, Saor Eire quickly found itself under attack from both Cumann na nGaedheal and the Catholic Church for being a communist organisation, with the IRA painted as guilty by association. Simultaneously, the Cumann na nGaedhael government gave itself emergency powers and began arresting IRA members. Both Twomey and the IRA decided that in order to hold off Cumann na nGaedheal, they would need to rally around Fianna Fáil. In February 1932 Cumann na nGaedhael called a snap election, hoping to catch both the IRA and Fianna Fáil on the backfoot. However, Fianna Fáil were able to secure victory. To the surprise of many, Cumann na nGaedhael choose to respect the result of the vote and stood aside to let Fianna Fáil into power. Initially, many Republicans and members of the IRA were overjoyed with the result. At first Fianna Fail seem to signal goodwill to the IRA by releasing many IRA prisoners. However, it quickly dawned upon the IRA that Fianna Fáil were not going to declare a Republic, and this put them in an awkward spot. A week after Fianna Fáil came to power, an internal document produced by the IRA leadership asked two fundamental questions: \\"can Fianna Fáil’s methods and policies achieve the Republic?\\", to which they answered No, and \\"can the IRA launch a successful revolution against the Fianna Fáil Government?\\", to which they also answered No. Both Twomey and the IRA were unsure how to proceed. In Twomey's own words \\"nobody had visualised a Free State which Republicans were not supposed to attack\\". Following the election of Fianna Fáil, Tom Barry and Twomey clashed over the direction going forward. Barry wished to see Saor Eire ended (believing its policies never gain mass support, and in fact, this made Saor Eire an undemocratic concept) and for the IRA to reconcile with Fianna Fáil. Twomey instead thought that the social programme of Saor Eire could and would gain democratic support. On 18 June 1936 the Fianna Fáil government banned the IRA. The following day Twomey was tried and jailed for three years for membership of the newly proscribed organisation. Under the IRA constitution, his tenure as IRA chief of staff ended automatically upon his arrest. He was imprisoned in the Curragh from 1936 to 1938. During his period of imprisonment his family depended heavily on money sent to them by Joseph McGarrity of Clan na Gael, a US-based IRA fundraising organisation. On his release, Twomey became adjutant general on Seán Russell's army council. He travelled to Britain and inspected the IRA's units there. Twomey concluded that the IRA was in no position to launch a campaign and withdrew from IRA activity. In 1939 he opened a newsagents and confectioners in Dublin's O'Connell Street. ==Post IRA life== Following a crackdown on the IRA by Éamon de Valera's government, he was interned for two weeks during 1940. He remained close to the IRA, giving assistance to republicans deported from Britain and mediating in disputes between IRA factions. While he did not take an active role in politics after the 1940s, he did speak at a number of republican commemorations, most notably at the restoration of Wolfe Tone's grave at Bodenstown in 1971. He never claimed an IRA pension from the Irish government or gave an account of his record to the Bureau of Military History, set up to record the recollections of participants involved in the struggle against British rule. He was badly injured in an accident in 1971 and was deeply affected by the death of his wife Kathleen Twomey in April 1978. Twomey himself died in October of that year. The presence at his funeral of members of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, Sinn Féin The Workers’ Party and Provisional Sinn Féin, the Irish labour movement and old IRA comrades from the 1930s was evidence of his enduring popularity. Twomey's papers from his period as IRA chief of staff, consisting of 28 boxes, are now kept at the Archives Department of University College Dublin. ==ReferencesBibliography=== * Dalton, Charles, With the Dublin Brigade 1917-1921 (London 1929) * English, Richard, 'Green on Red: Two Case Studies in Early Twentieth-Century Irish Republican Thought', in D George Boyce et al.

Throughout Apollo, Skylab, Space Shuttle, and Space Station missions, the space suit has been required to protect astronauts from hazards faced in earth's orbit and on the surface of the moon. These hazards include the vacuum environment of space, temperature extremes ranging from -250 degrees Fahrenheit to 250 degrees Fahrenheit, the impact of micrometeoroids and orbital debris, and lunar dust. Above the 63,000 foot threshold, spacesuits are needed to supply oxygen and to provide a pressurized environment around the body to keep body fluids in a liquid state.NASA History Program Office, Human Space Flight, Spacesuits. Retrieved on 2011-02-10. ===Apollo and Skylab=== ILC began delivering spacesuits for the Apollo program in 1966. Initial deliveries of suits did not perform well in tests and NASA initially cancelled its contract with ILC and Hamilton Standard. NASA relaunched the program to develop a spacesuit for the Apollo program experimenting at first with hard suits. ILC and Hamilton Standard submitted competing designs this time with ILC winning the sole contract based on its flexible, close-fitting design which featured water cooled undergarment, a blue inner pressurized layer, and covered in a white nylon layer to protect the suits from rocks. Hamilton received a separate contract for the life support backpack unit. ILC was further challenged after the Apollo 1 fire to remove all flammable material from space suits. After a nationwide search, ILC settled on beta cloth, a fireproof silica fiber cloth. Apollo spacesuits were custom-made for each of the astronauts in the program, and for each of the twelve crewed flights carried out, ILC produced fifteen suits. Three suits were made for each of the three astronauts comprising the crew (one suit for flight, one for training, one for back-up) and two suits were made for each of the three back-up crew members (one suit for flight and one for training). Twenty extra-vehicular activities (EVAs) were performed during the Apollo program, and ten were performed during Skylab.

The SSA is made of individual components which are assembled to fit each astronaut. Since the first shuttle EVA in 1983, 216 U.S. astronauts have performed a total of 74 shuttle EVAs, combining for greater than 470 hours in space. ===International Space Station=== The shuttle EMU was improved for use on the International Space Station (ISS). The suits for the ISS were modified to provide greater mobility, to afford better tactile capabilities of the glove, and to provide an increased operational life. As of February 2011, a total of 104 EVAs on the ISS had occurred, for greater than 650 total hours in space. ===Mark III=== The Mark III (MKIII) is an experimental suit that was designed by ILC for use on the space station.

Although never qualified as an architect, he became known for his Brick Expressionist style of architecture. == Early life == Höger was the eldest of six siblings in a family who ran a small carpentry business. At the age of 14, Höger trained as a carpenter in Elmshorn and then went on to Hamburg for his masters which was completed in 1899. Following this he joined the architectural firm Lundt and Kallmorgen in Hamburg, where he worked as a technical draftsman. After his four-year stint there, Höger joined the company of his future father-in-law, Fritz Oldenburg, and married Fritz's daughter Annie in 1905.(German) Fritz HögerArchitectuul: Fritz Höger Anzeiger-Hochhaus, Hannover at night == Architecture == Höger is renowned for his use of brick, in the style of Brick Expressionism. Höger opened his own architecture office in 1907, but because of his lack of higher education he was not admitted to the Association of German Architects. Regardless, he received many commissions for private homes around Hamburg. It was during this time that Höger established his style with the use of bricks, particularly clinker bricks, which are more robust and frost resistant due to the higher temperature they are fired at. Höger's style was seen in the 'dished house' which is now home to the department store Kaufhof. It features a strong vertical and horizontal layout with the placement of the eaves and stepped floors, a technique which became typical to Höger's style of building. Höger's preference for the use of brick was along the lines of ideas espoused by Fritz Schumacher, the Hamburg chief architect beginning in 1909; Schumacher expounded his ideas in polemical writings, including the book Das Wesen des neuzeitlichen Backsteinbaues (The Essence of the Modern Brick Building), which appeared around 1920.(German) \\"Der Architeckt [Johann Friedrich, genannt Fritz, Höger].\\" Bauverein der Kirche Am Hohenzollernplatz zu Berlin- Wilmersdorf e.

Like Schumacher, Höger thought brick and clinker brick showed an \\"earthiness\\" that was familiar to the German people, particularly because these materials were typical for Northern Germany. His best-known work is the Chilehaus in Hamburg, constructed between 1922-24 for saltpeter importer Henry B. (Chile) Sloman. The office block features a curving facade reminiscent of a ship's hull, coming together at a sharp angle on the corners of Pumpen and Niedernstrasse.Architectuul: Chile House Höger constructed several other buildings, more prominently a publishing office which included a planetarium, the Anzeiger-Hochhaus (Gazette-Building) between 1927-1928. The 51m high building was the first skyscraper in Hannover.(German) Anzeiger-Hochhaus It features a now green copper dome and red clinker bricks offset with a decorative gold. The dome originally housed a planetarium, and is now a cinema.Architectuul: Anzeiger- Hochhaus Other notable works include the Kirche am Hohenzollernplatz in Berlin and the Wilhelmshaven town hall.

Later during World War II Höger sympathized with National Socialism (Nazism) and joined the party in 1932. However his expressionistic style did not meet Hitler's taste. As Höger did not follow the preferred classicist marble style of Nazi architecture, he could not obtain a position as state architect. == Fritz Höger Award == For the first time in 2008, the Fritz Höger Prize was awarded for excellence in brick architecture. The initiative goes for buildings with brick, with winners in the categories of detached or semi-detached houses, apartment buildings, office, commercial, leisure and sport, as well as public buildings.

Although the novel is fiction, it is based on real life experiences of people who have worked with feral children. ==Summary== Mila, a girl raised by dolphins, is discovered and captured on a cay and taken to a scientific research facility. She progresses quickly and meets Shay, who looks like Mila, another feral child, and thought that they were alike, two girls that are different from the people around them. Shay is a quiet girl. As more time passes, she falls in love with music and Doctor Beck's son Justin, and wonders why she progresses so quickly, yet Shay cannot. Shay is sent to another home, with other children. And Sandy explains to Mila that the feral children that have been studied, they have stopped progressing at a point, all except for Mila. Soon, Mila finds her newfound knowledge slipping away and becomes more dolphin again. She requests to be released back to the ocean and after some discussing among her caregivers, she was being returned to the ocean and reunites with her dolphin family. ==Characters== Mila: The protagonist of the story, a girl raised by dolphins. She is captured on a cay and taken to a scientific research facility, where she is taught to be a human and Doctor Beck who help her in her struggle to learn English and about human life. At one point, Mila learns that her real name could be Olivia, and that her father, who is Cuban, is alive. Doctor Beck: The main doctor that takes care of Mila and helps her learn to speak and to be a human. Shay: A friend of Mila, a little girl. Shay was said to be kept in solitary confinement in Idaho. Later, she is taken from the research facility to a foster home. Justin: Doctor Beck's son. At first he is resentful and jealous of Mila and the attention Dr. Beck gives her. Later he tells Mila that Dr. Beck's interest in Mila is more scientific than familial. However, the two fall in love in the climax of the story. Sandy: A friend of Dr. Beck's. She sometimes acts as a caregiver of Mila, who finds Sandy to be the most sympathetic and understanding person in the story. Mr. Aradondo: A janitor at the facility where Mila is kept. He appears to be afraid of Mila, though he openly expresses concern for her well-being when she develops a high fever. He reminds Mila of her grandfather. Doctor Troy and Doctor Peach: Colleagues of Doctor Beck, who also help with Mila and Shay learn about music and the English language. Dolphins: The ones that raise Mila. Her dolphin mother has a spotted tail or fluke, and wise eyes; she had lost her baby calf shortly before finding Mila. ==External links== * Karen Hesse's page on Macmillan.com Category:1996 American novels Category:American children's novels Category:Fictional feral children Category:Fiction about dolphins Category:Novels set in the Caribbean Category:Children's novels about animals Category:1996 children's books ","title":"The Music of Dolphins"},{"id":"2235113","text":"Octave effect boxes are a type of special effects unit which mix the input signal with a synthesised signal whose musical tone is an octave lower or higher than the original. The synthesised octave signal is derived from the original input signal by halving (octave-down) or doubling (octave-up) the frequency. This is possible due to the simple two-to-one relationship between the frequencies of musical notes which are separated by an octave. One of the first popular musicians to employ the octave effect was Jimi Hendrix, who also used a variety of other effects in his recordings and public performances. Hendrix used an octave-fuzz pedal known as the octavia. Analog octave effects differ from harmonizers and pitch shifters which digitally sample the sound and process it to change its pitch. == Creation of the octave  Octave up === Octave up by rectification Octave-up effects usually use full wave rectification using diodes to \\"fold up\\" the negative part of the waveform to make a new waveform an octave higher in pitch. === Octave down === pedal demo on bass. (Octave down). Octave-down effects are typically produced by converting the signal to a square wave, and then using flip-flop circuits to divide the frequency by two. This creates a buzzy synthesizer like tone. The MXR Blue Box used this method to create a two octave drop (expanded to include one octave down in later re-issues). Jimmy Page used a Blue Box to record the solo on Led Zeppelin's Fool in the Rain. MXR Bluebox (reissue model), an octafuzz producing octave down tones.The Boss OC-2 unit generates tones at one and two octaves down from the input signal. This effect also uses flip-flops to generate square waves at 1/2 and 1/4 of the input signal frequency, but rather than simply mixing in these signals, it uses them to invert the polarity of the input signal on every other cycle (every two out of four cycles for the second octave). This effectively amplitude modulates the input signal with a carrier at half the input signal, creating new frequency components at 1/2 and 3/2 the input signal. The 3/2 component is low-pass filtered out. This more complex approach lessens the synthetic sound of the octave tones by making them more closely associated with the original signal, and also makes the effect volume-sensitive. The Boss OC-3 (2006) has an additional mode called \\"Poly\\" where only a low note is added with the idea to add a bass line to chords. The Mu-tron Octave Divider (about 1972) had a unique generator that tuned into the low octave as long as the input signal was strong and then continued generating the same frequency while that input signal faded. == Use of octave effects == Octave pedals can be used in conjunction with fuzz (see octafuzz) and/or distortion. It can be used on guitar to make it sound more aggressive (such as the lead-in solo by Prince on When Doves Cry) or sound like a bass. The song Seven Nation Army by The White Stripes features an octave pedal on electric guitar, simulating the sound of a bass. == References == Category:Audio effects ","title":"Octave effect"},{"id":"2235118","text":"The Spectator from 7 June 1711 The Spectator was a daily publication founded by Joseph Addison and Richard Steele in England, lasting from 1711 to 1712. Each \\"paper\\", or \\"number\\", was approximately 2,500 words long, and the original run consisted of 555 numbers, beginning on 1 March 1711.Information Britain These were collected into seven volumes. The paper was revived without the involvement of Steele in 1714, appearing thrice weekly for six months, and these papers when collected formed the eighth volume. Eustace Budgell, a cousin of Addison's, and the poet John Hughes also contributed to the publication. ==Aims== In Number 10, Mr. Spectator states that The Spectator will aim \\"to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with morality\\". The journal reached an audience of thousands of people every day, because \\"the Spectators was something that every middle-class household with aspirations to looking like its members took literature seriously would want to have.\\" He hopes it will be said he has \\"brought philosophy out of closets and libraries, schools, and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and coffee–houses\\". Women specifically were also a target audience for The Spectator, because one of the aims of the periodical was to increase the number of women who were \\"of a more elevated life and conversation.\\" Steele states in The Spectator, No. 10, \\"But there are none to whom this paper will be more useful than to the female world.\\" He recommends that readers of the paper consider it \\"as a part of the tea-equipage\\" and set aside time to read it each morning.Addison, Joseph (1837). The Works of Joseph Addison, Vol. I, p.31. Harper & Brothers. The Spectator sought to provide readers with topics for well-reasoned discussion, and to equip them to carry on conversations and engage in social interactions in a polite manner.Bowers, Terence. \\"Universalizing Sociability: The Spectator, Civic Enfranchisement, and the Rule(s) of the Public Sphere.\\" In Newman, Donald J., ed. (2005). The Spectator: Emerging Discourses, pp. 155-56. University of Delaware Press. In keeping with the values of Enlightenment philosophies of their time, the authors of The Spectator promoted family, marriage, and courtesy. ==Readership== Title pages of the edition of the collected edition of Addison and Steele's The Spectator Despite a modest daily circulation of approximately 3,000 copies, The Spectator was widely read; Joseph Addison estimated that each number was read by thousands of Londoners, about a tenth of the capital's population at the time. Contemporary historians and literary scholars, meanwhile, do not consider this to be an unreasonable claim; most readers were not themselves subscribers but patrons of one of the subscribing coffeehouses. These readers came from many stations in society, but the paper catered principally to the interests of England's emerging middle class—merchants and traders large and small. The Spectator also had many readers in the American colonies. In particular, James Madison read the paper avidly as a teenager. It is said to have had a big influence on his world view, lasting throughout his long life.Ralph Ketcham, James Madison, A Biography, 1971, pp. 39-48 Benjamin Franklin was also a reader, and the Spectator influenced his style in his \\"Silence Dogood\\" letters. Jürgen Habermas sees The Spectator as instrumental in the formation of the public sphere in 18th century England.Habermas, Jürgen (1989). The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry Into a Category of Bourgeois Society. Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Although The Spectator declares itself to be politically neutral, it was widely recognised as promoting Whig values and interests. The Spectator continued to be popular and widely read in the late 18th and 19th centuries. It was sold in eight-volume editions. Its prose style, and its marriage of morality and advice with entertainment, were considered exemplary. The decline in its popularity has been discussed by Brian McCrea and C. S. Lewis. == Works  Inkle and Yarico === In The Spectator, No.11, Steele created a frame narrative that would come to be an incredibly well known story in the eighteenth century, the story of Inkle and Yarico. Although the periodical essay was published on March 13 of 1711, the story is based on Richard Ligon's publication in 1647. Ligon's publication, A True and Exact History of the Island of Barbadoes, reports on how the cruelties of the transatlantic slave trade contribute to slave-produced goods such as tobacco and sugarcane. Mr. Spectator goes to speak with an older woman, Arietta, whom many people visit to discuss various topics. When Mr. Spectator enters the room, there is already another man present speaking with Arietta. They are discussing \\"constancy in love,\\" and the man uses the tale of The Ephesian Matron to support his point. Arietta is insulted and angered by the man's hypocrisy and sexism. She counters his tale with one of her own, the story of Inkle and Yarico. Thomas Inkle, a twenty-year-old man from London, sailed to the West Indies to increase his wealth through trade. While on an island, he encounters a group of Indians, who battle and kill many of his shipmates. After fleeing, Inkle hides in a cave where he discovers Yarico, an Indian maiden. They become enamored with one another's clothing and physical appearances, and Yarico for the next several months hides her lover from her people and provides him with food and fresh water. Eventually, a ship passes, headed for Barbadoes, and Inkle and Yarico use this opportunity to leave the island. After reaching the English colony, Inkle sells Yarico to a merchant, even after she tells him that she is pregnant. Arietta closes the tale stating that Inkle simply uses Yarico's declaration to argue for a higher price when selling her. Mr. Spectator is so moved by the legend that he takes his leave. Steele's text was so well known and influential that seven decades after his publication, George Colman modified the short story into a comic opera, showcasing three relationships between characters of varying social statuses to reach multiple audiences. ==See also== * Bully Dawson, mentioned in The Spectator as being kicked by \\"Sir Roger de Coverley\\" in a public coffee house * The Spectator, a current weekly British conservative magazine, which borrows its name from the 1711 publication ==Notes== ==References== * The Spectator Nos. 1, 2, 10 [Addison], 1710–11. * The Spectator No. 11 [Addison], 1710–11. * Brian McCrea, Addison and Steele are Dead: The English Department, Its Canon, and the Professionalization of Literary Criticism * C.

It is one of only a few movies shown on MST3K that was made in the 1990s. == Plot == The plot revolves around a young boy named Travis (nicknamed \\"Tee\\") who learns from his master that he is the key to saving the world from an evil plot. Tee joins the secret organization of the Delta Knights and embarks on a quest to attempt to recover the lost treasures inside the fabled Lost Storehouse of Archimedes. The plot is markedly similar to that of Robert Heinlein's Citizen of the Galaxy, including its essentially identical setup of a young slave boy—who is really the lost heir of a powerful family—being bought for a pittance by a seeming beggar, who is himself really a spy, and who suspects the boy's true identity. ==Anachronisms== Also noteworthy is the extreme confusion the film displays with regard to setting, both in terms of time period and location. The story would seem to take place in medieval England all along a number of plot elements contradicting this. Vultare's henchmen wear headgear strongly resembling (stereotypical) Viking helmets. Baydool states that they are in the Dark Ages, yet firearms are inexplicably used. Leonardo da Vinci, a figure from Renaissance Italy, appears as a major character in the plot. Finally, Leonardo and Tee are searching for the lost storehouse of Archimedes, a figure from ancient Syracuse, Sicily, whose storehouse one might reasonably think unlikely to be found in England. A document held by Archimedes seen in a flashback is also clearly held together by staples. ==Filming locations== A large portion of this movie was filmed at the Renaissance Pleasure Faire in Black Point, Novato, California. Performers from the Faire were employed as extras in various scenes throughout. Exterior scenes of Archimedes' storehouse were filmed at the Palace of Fine Arts, San Francisco, California. Exterior scenes of the prison were filmed at Petaluma Adobe State Historic Park, Petaluma, California. Some interior scenes of the Mannerjay's palace were filmed at the Scottish Rite Temple, Oakland, California. == Cast == * David Warner - Baydool / Lord Vultare / Narrator * Corbin Allred - Tee * Olivia Hussey - The Mannerjay * David Kriegel - Leonardo * Brigid Brannagh - Thena * Sarah Douglas - Madam Maaydeed * Richard Kind - Wamthool ==Production== David Warner was originally intended to play one character in the movie but suggested that he could play two roles for the same cost. ==Reception== Jim Craddock, author of VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever, gave the movie two and half stars. In a 2017 interview with The A.V. Club, David Warner expressed his enjoyment in being in Quest of the Delta Knights, followed by his amusement at the film being featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000. ==ReferencesCategory:1993 films Category:1990s action adventure films Category:1990s fantasy adventure films Category:American fantasy adventure films Category:American films Category:American sword and sorcery films Category:Cultural depictions of Leonardo da Vinci ","title":"Quest of the Delta Knights"},{"id":"2235130","text":"Makhtesh Ramon (; lit. Ramon Crater/Makhtesh ; ) is a geological feature of Israel's Negev desert. Located at the peak of Mount Negev, some 85 km south of the city of Beersheba, the landform is not an impact crater from a meteor nor a volcanic crater formed by a volcanic eruption, but rather is the world's largest \\"erosion cirque\\" (steephead valley or box canyons). The formation is 40 km long, 2–10 km wide and 500 meters deep, and is shaped like an elongated heart. The only settlement in the area is the small town of Mitzpe Ramon (מצפה רמון, \\"Ramon Lookout\\") located on the northern edge of the depression. Today the area forms Israel's largest national park, the Ramon Nature Reserve. ==Formation== A Nubian ibex on the edges of Makhtesh Ramon Hundreds of millions of years ago, the Negev desert was covered by an ocean. Slowly, this started to recede northwards leaving behind a hump-shaped hill. The hump was slowly flattened by water and climatic forces. Approximately five million years ago, the Arava Rift Valley was formed, with rivers changing their courses, carving out the inside of the crater which was a softer rock than that overlying. The crater bottom continued to deepen at a much faster rate than the surrounding walls, which gradually increased in height. As the crater deepened, more layers of ancient rock were exposed with rocks at the bottom of the crater being up to 200 million years old. Today, the crater is 500 metres deep with the deepest point being Ein Saharonim (Saharonim Spring) which also contains the makhtesh's only natural water source, which sustains much of the wildlife in the makhtesh including onagers and ibex. ==Geology== Makhtesh Ramon contains a diversity of rocks including clay hills known for their fantastic red and yellow colors and forms. Impressive mountains rise at the borders of the crater - Har Ramon (Mt. Ramon) at the southern end, Har Ardon (Mt. Ardon) at the north-eastern end, and two table mountains - Har Marpek (Mt. Marpek - \\"Elbow\\"), and Har Katum (Mt. Katum - \\"Cropped\\") along the southern wall. The hills to the north-eastern edge of the makhtesh were once entirely covered by spiral ammonite fossils, ranging from the size of snails to that of tractor wheels although these have mainly been extracted so only smaller fossils can be found here today. Giv'at Ga'ash, a black hill in the north of the makhtesh was once an active volcano which erupted thousands of years ago and caused it to be covered in lava which quickly cooled in the open air, converting it into basalt. Limestone covered by basalt can also be found in smaller black hills in the southern part of the makhtesh, including Karnei Ramon. Shen Ramon (Ramon's Tooth) is a rock made of magma which hardened whilst underground. It later rose up through cracks in the Earth's surface, and today stands in striking contrast with the nearby creamy coloured southern wall of the crater, as a black sharp-edged rock. In the centre of the makhtesh is HaMinsara (The Carpentry Shop), a low hill made up of columnar jointed sandstone - polygonal prismatic columns of quartzite. The pterioid bivalve Family Ramonalinidae is found in early Middle Triassic rocks of Makhtesh Ramon and was named after this feature. Nahal Ardon in the east of the makhtesh contains several vertical dikes. Occasional geodes of celestine can be found next to some of them. == Fauna == A Nubian ibex on the edges of Makhtesh Ramon The Asian wild ass has been reintroduced to Makhtesh Ramon. In 1995 the population had increased to 40 adults in the area. The animals are hybrids of two different subspecies of the Asian Wild Ass. It is derived from the Turkmenian kulan (E. h. kulan) and the Persian onager (E. h. onager). The original subspecies, the Syrian wild ass (E. h. hemippus), is completely extinct.David Saltz David, Mary Rowen, Daniel I. Rubenstein: The Effect of Space-Use Patterns of Reintroduced Asiatic Wild Ass on Effective Population Size. Conservation Biology, Vol. 14, No. 6, 2000 Other larger mammals of the area include Nubian ibexes, Dorcas gazelles, striped hyenas and few Arabian leopards. ==History== The ruins of a large prehistoric stone structure known as Khan Saharonim are found in the makhtesh, as it lies along the ancient Incense Route, a trade route used by the Nabataeans 2,000 years ago. These ruins acted as a way station for the traders and their animals (khan is the Arabic word for a caravanserai) as they proceeded further westwards to the Mediterranean seaport city of Gaza. ==Gallery== Image:View of Makhtesh Ramon from its west (4).jpgView of Makhtesh Ramon from its west Image:Machtesh ramon mitzpe ramon on the edge-by avi-yotham-2010.jpgThe cliff Image:Dry Drimia maritima (Urginea maritima), at the north edge of Ramon crater (Makhtesh Ramon), Negev, Israel.jpgDry Drimia maritima (Urginea maritima) at the northern edge of the makhtesh Image:Machtesh-ramon-01.JPGRock formation (dike) Image:Ha-Minsara (The Carpentry Shop) in Makhtesh Ramon, Negev, Israel.jpgHa-Minsara (The Sawmill) Image:Sandy rectangular and hexagonal prisms at the centre of Makhtesh Ramon - Ha-Minsara (The Carpentry Shop), Israel.jpgSandy rectangular and hexagonal prisms at the centre of Makhtesh Ramon – Ha-Minsara (The Sawmill) Image:Ammonite-wall2.jpgAn ammonite in the Ammonite Wall Image:AmmoniteWallTamar052811.jpgAmmonite Wall (Tamar Formation, Cenomanian) Image:ISR-2013-Makhtesh Ramon-Sandstone color bands 02.jpgSandstone color bands Image:Maktesh Ramon Map Wikivoyage en rasterized.pngMap of Makhtesh Ramon ==References== *Mazor, Emanuel and Krasnov, Boris, editors \\"The Makhteshim Country - a Laboratory of Nature\\".

The term was coined by Vogue magazine's editor-in-chief Diana Vreeland in 1965. Youthquake involved music, pop culture and changed the landscape of the fashion industry. The movement is characterized by looking to youth culture for a source of inspiration, taking dominance away from the English and Parisian couture houses. == Emergence == With the massive market of \\"baby boomers\\" coming into young adulthood, this generation challenged the norms of the past and were successful due to their large population. Women's economic, sexual, and social independence is seen as a catalyst that caused the many to reject the idealized femininity of the 1950s. In England, the emerging generation was bored of the couture houses' conservative designs and instead looked to boutiques to reinvent their style. This was a time in society when teenagers were able to explore their own identities and had the freedom to push boundaries due to post-World War II conditions. The boutique saw the start of the London ready-to-wear industry as people flocked for mass-produced clothing at a lower price point than its predecessors. Mary Quant, often credited for inventing the mini-skirt, was a leader in the boutique movement and attributed her primary source of inspiration to the street style of the youth. Boutiques Biba, Bazaar and Paraphernalia housed talent like Betsey Johnson and Emmanuelle Khanh and utilized mass-production to fill their shops with the latest trends. These boutiques were key players in London and the US as they were the first to cater specifically to the youth market with a modern approach: \\"clothes displayed like art in a gallery, cooler-than-thou young salesgirls, and rock and roll blaring from the speakers—shops that marketed clothes as part of a whole, deliriously amusing lifestyle\\". The Scott Paper Company took advantage of mass-production and created disposable chemise dresses out of their patented Dura-Weave paper. Mass-production gave Scott the ability to print a diverse assortment of eye-catching patterns and Pop Art inspired motifs that appealed to the youth consumer. The fashion of youthquake was fun, spirited and youthful – miniskirts, jumpsuits, and A-line silhouettes in bold colors were all the rage. Trends like mod, Space Age, and hippie styles were birthed from this cultural phenomenon. Poster girls of the youthquakers such as Jean Shrimpton, Twiggy, Penelope Tree, Veruschka, and Edie Sedgwick were often on the cover of fashion magazines such as Vogue.Vogue, January 1, 1965, p 112 Pop icons like the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix were also used in advertising to reinforce fashion trends and drive sales. == In haute couture == Luxury designers like Andrè Courrèges and Yves Saint Laurent came out with mini-skirt infused spring collections in the mid-1960s with bold graphic silhouettes and pants for all occasions. Courrèges' \\"recognition of the revolution launched by the younger generation\\" revitalized and preserved high fashion by \\"injecting [its] elements into Haute Couture\\". Designers Paco Rabanne and Courrèges experimented with industrial plastics and metallic fibers in exploring the Space Age trend. In the end, many couture houses opened boutiques carrying ready-to-wear styles. In contrast to that, houses like Balenciaga closed their couture doors completely. == Legacy == The concept of the \\"bubble-up\\" theory, where ideas and inspiration was taken from the low-context culture instead of the high- context culture setting the standards, was the lasting impact of the youthquake movement. Other legacies included the miniskirt, as it symbolized independence and liberation for women during the time and the trouser suit which inspired the looks of the following decade and redefined femininity. The almost androgynous shapes and aesthetic of the Space Age trend sparked experimentation of form. The use of pop culture icons in fashion advertising set a new precedent for successful marketing into the 21st century. In December 2017, OxfordDictionaries.com declared the idiom word of the year, noting a five-fold increase in its use during the year, particularly in reference to young people's political engagement. == See also == * * Edie Sedgwick, original Youthquaker, 'It' girl * Lana Del Rey, Neo-youthquake * Phlo Finister, Neo-youthquake ==References== == External links == *CNN-Cold War Experience: Culture (archived link) *vintagefashionguide 1960s Category:1960s fashion ","title":"Youthquake (movement)"},{"id":"2235135","text":"Here Come the Brides is the debut album by Brides of Destruction released via Sanctuary Records on March 9, 2004.

The album's only single, \\"Shut The Fuck Up\\" failed to chart due to little airplay. \\"Only Get So Far\\" was originally written by Nikki Sixx for Tim McGraw and Faith Hill. ==Background and recording== Brides of Destruction was formed by Nikki Sixx and Tracii Guns in Los Angeles 2002 initially with the name Cockstar after Mötley Crüe went on hiatus and Tracii left L.A. Guns. The lineup was rounded off with singer London LeGrand, keyboardist Adam Hamilton and Kris Kohls of Adema on drums. They were advised by radio programmers that the name Cockstar wouldn't be announced on air.

It was the first in-house design of Plage i Laśkiewicz, and the first with the name Lublin. ==Development== The aircraft was designed in answer to a request of the Polish Air Force for a heavy single-engine reconnaissance and bomber airplane. Work started in 1926. The main designer was Jerzy Rudlicki (the letter \\"R\\" in the designation for his name). The prototype R-VIII was flown in March, 1928. It was fitted with a Farman 12We W-12 engine, but in tests proved to be underpowered. In July 1928 the second prototype was completed with a more powerful Lorraine-Dietrich 18Kd engine. In August 1928 it flew in the Aviation Contest of the Little Entente and Poland. It achieved the best result in trials of carrying a payload ( to an altitude of . In 1929, the Polish Aviation Department of War Ministry ordered four aircraft with the designation R-VIIIa. They were built in early 1930. One was fitted with a Lorraine-Dietrich engine, the rest with the Hispano-Suiza 12Lb. More were not ordered, as the aircraft had good performance when carrying only a limited payload and fuel reserve (which limited its range), when it carried more bombs, or maximum fuel load, its performance was poor. The prototypes and serial production aircraft were used by the Polish Air Force only for a short time. In August–September 1930, three R-VIIIa flew in the Aviation Contest of the Little Entente and Poland, taking a mediocre 7th and 9th places. In service, both Lorraine-Dietrich-powered aircraft crashed - in 1930 and 1931. In 1932, the existing R-VIIIs were converted to floatplanes for the Polish Navy. The first prototype was fitted with Lorraine-Dietrich engine and was designated R-VIII bis (Aircraft number 801). Two aircraft with Hispano-Suiza engines were designated R-VIII ter (numbers 802 and 803). The fourth aircraft was broken into spare parts. The maximum speed of the floatplane variant was lowered to 200 km/h. They were also called R-VIII/hydro. A six-seat passenger aircraft, the R-IX, was developed in 1929, based on the R-VIII, but it remained a prototype. ==Operational service== The R-VIII floatplanes were used by the Polish Naval Aviation Squadron (MDLot) in Puck from 1933, in a long reconnaissance escadre. From 1938, they were assigned to training, and were scheduled for withdrawal from service. They survived until the Invasion of Poland in 1939, but the R-VIII bis had its engine removed by then. After the first German air raid on naval aviation base in Puck on September 1, all floatplanes were evacuated from Puck to the Hel Peninsula (the bulk were Lublin R-XIIIs). Since R-VIIIs were quite obsolete by then, they were not used in combat. They were anchored on Puck Bay by Chalupy on Hel Peninsula, near the base of the peninsula, where they were bombed by Stukas on September 8. ==Description== Wooden construction biplane, conventional in layout. A fuselage was rectangular in cross-section, plywood covered. Wings canvas and plywood covered, upper wing of greater span.

It shut down due to financial cutbacks in 2001, but was revived on February 19, 2007 with a grant of $5 million from the Canadian federal government. ==History== ParticipACTION emerged from Sport Participation Canada, a non-profit organization formed on July 12, 1971 in response to a 1969 study commissioned by the National Advisory Council for Fitness and Amateur Sport that found that the future of Canadian health was at risk from poor physical fitness and apathy on the part of Canadians. Council Chair Philippe de Gaspé Beaubien recommended that the Government of Canada provide seed money for an independent agency with public and private funding that would work to promote physical fitness. Lou Lefaive from Sport Canada was assigned to assist in its founding. Marketing consultant Keith McKerracher was appointed to lead the new organization. Former Prime Minister of Canada Lester B. Pearson chaired the board from 1971 to 1972, while Philippe de Gaspé Beaubien served as president. In 1972, the company was nationalized by then- Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to battle exorbitant health care costs. The resulting government program was renamed ParticipACTION. A 1973 commercial, comparing the health of a 30-year-old Canadian to a 60-year-old Swede, started a national discussion on the state of physical education in Canada. The spot had its origin in juxtaposed pages of a book by Dr. Roy Shephard, then the Director of the Graduate Programme in Exercise Science the University of Toronto. On one page, a table of international fitness comparisons showed Swedes at the top of the ranking and Canadians significantly lower in the list; on the other side, an illustration showed that a sixty-year-old active man could be as fit as a sedentary thirty-year-old. When Russ Kisby (an early hire of McKerracher) showed McKerracher the book, the separate ideas were fused into the famous PSA. The ensuing outcry of alarm and embarrassment triggered a debate in the Parliament of Canada. In the 1990s ParticipACTION became well-known for its television public service announcements (PSAs) such as Body Break hosted by Hal Johnson and Joanne McLeod. The series had been rejected by 40 companies including broadcasters and advertising agencies, including by various broadcasters, including The Sports Network, who weren't interested in showing an interracial couple. With that frustration, Johnson approached ParticipACTION who agreed to fund the series, funding the first 65 of over 300 episodes.. As a result, BodyBreak became a mainstay of Canadian television, including on networks that previously rejected it like TSN. In 2018, ParticipACTION introduced the idea that Everything gets better when you get active to help change the way people think about physical activity, focusing on all the benefits of active living (improved sleep, more energy, better focus). The Everything Gets Better campaign won Shopper Innovation and Marketing awards in 2020. The organization provides guidance to help Canadians achieve whatever “better” they wish to achieve, making physical activity part of Canadians’ everyday lives. In 2019, the organization launched the ParticipACTION app which distinguishes itself by providing research and evidence-based health and fitness articles along with exercise how-tos in tandem with fitness tracking capabilities. App users receive prizes for doing things like getting active, reading or watching content in the app or sharing these things with others via social media, text or email. The organization runs a variety of other initiatives as well to support its vision: * The Community Better Challenge, naming Canada's Most Active Community * Analysis of the state of physical activity among children & youth, adults and how this compares to other countries * Programming to help workplaces reduce sedentary behaviour and increase physically active ParticipACTION was led by President and CEO Kelly Murumets from 2007 until 2014, when Elio Antunes was named to lead the organization. ==See also== Lack of physical education ==References== ==External links== *ParticipACTION *Healthy Canadians - federal government portal, accessed 19 February 2007 *The ParticipACTION archive project *CBC Digital Archives – Getting Physical: Canada's Fitness Movement *Legendary fitness program is back in the game Category:Canadian television commercials Category:Sports organizations of Canada Category:Medical and health organizations based in Ontario Category:Health education in Canada Category:1971 establishments in Canada ","title":"ParticipACTION"},{"id":"2235196","text":"Rolland G. Smith (born December 6, 1941) is an American former television news reporter and anchor who is best known for his time in New York, where he was based for most of his long career. ==Broadcasting career== Smith's earliest broadcasting job was for Metromedia Television, where he served as White House correspondent for WTTG.Kosmos Journal Rolland Smith Metromedia would later transfer him to New York, where he would become co-anchor of WNEW-TV's 10 PM newscast. Smith departed Metromedia for CBS in 1970, and instantly became a reporter and anchor for WCBS. In 1973 Smith was named co-anchor of WCBS' evening newscasts, a position he held for 13 years. His 11 PM co-anchors included Dave Marash (1973–1978 and 1981–1982) and Vic Miles (1978–1979), before Michele Marsh joined him for the balance of his run with channel 2. Starting in late 1975, he was teamed with Jim Jensen on the 6 PM newscast, a partnership that remained until Smith's departure from the station. He left WCBS when he was promoted to co-host of CBS' The Morning Program in January 1987. Smith left CBS that December after the show was canceled. Following this he moved to WWOR, and in early 1988 he became the lead anchor of the station's 10 PM newscast replacing Tom Dunn. Smith would leave WWOR in 1993 and moved from New York for the first time since his transfer from Washington, as he relocated to San Diego to take an anchor position at NBC affiliate KNSD. This was the first time Smith had worked for a network-affiliated station since his 1987 departure from WCBS (WWOR, at the time, was an independent and was a year away from gaining any affiliation). He stayed with KNSD until 1997 and returned to New York, but did not immediately return to television. After a four-year absence (which included a brief stint at WRNN), Smith rejoined WWOR as lead anchor following Ernie Anastos' departure to return to WCBS. He eventually moved to weekends as the co-anchor of the station's now-former Saturday and Sunday newscasts. In addition to his anchor duties, on each newscast he provided a small commentary that would be accompanied by his signature superimposed on screen. After a long career Smith announced his retirement in 2006, ending a nearly 40-year career with 11 Emmy Awards for his body of work. ==Outside of news== In addition to his news career, Smith is a published poet with several books and CDs of his writings in print. As a part of WWOR during its time being owned by MCA, he made a cameo appearance in the now-extinct King Kong Encounter at Universal Studios Hollywood. ==\\"Fighting the frizzies, at 11\\"== This obscure-in-origin catchphrase among both Star Wars and South Park fans traces its origins to Rolland Smith.

Among the most widely circulated recordings is one made from the broadcast on WCBS-TV, though recordings of the broadcast from many other CBS affiliates as well as overseas broadcasters abound.

Following the break up of Jawbreaker, frontman Blake Schwarzenbach moved to New York City, and formed Jets to Brazil with bassist/vocalist Jeremy Chatelain (of Handsome) and drummer Chris Daly (of Texas Is the Reason). J. Robbins was drafted in to produce the group's debut at Easley Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. With Orange Rhyming Dictionary, Schwarzenbach moved away from the punk rock sound of Jawbreaker into indie rock and post-hardcore. The Van Pelt guitarist Brian Maryansky joined Jets to Brazil, prior to touring the US and Japan. Further stints of the US and Europe followed into early 2000. ==Background and production== During the early-to-mid 1990s, Jawbreaker were viewed as what Dave Clifford of SF Weekly referred to as \\"indie darlings\\" that were praised for their \\"headstrong resistance\\" against the mainstream music industry. The group signed to major label DGC Records, which brought them vitriol from their friends. Due to a lack of success from radio stations and MTV disregarding their final album Dear You in 1995, the band broke up shortly after playing their final show in May 1996. Frontman Blake Schwarzenbach briefly played drums in Moons, before moving from San Francisco to New York City. He settled into an apartment in Brooklyn; that same day, Schwarzenbach met bassist/vocalist Jeremy Chatelain, who was a friend of his girlfriend. Chatelain's band Handsome was recording a major label debut at the time. The duo quickly became friends and planned to meet up later in the year; Schwarzenbach spent the next few months recording demos. With no intention of playing in a band again, Schwarzenbach spent 1997 writing for Spin and GameSpot. Sometime after, Schwarzenbach started playing with synthesizers and samplers, taping some songs on a TASCAM four-track recorder. Chatelain, with Handsome now broken up, heard Schwarzenbach's demos, and attempted to talk Schwarzenbach into playing music again. Chatelain, who was aware that Texas Is the Reason had broken up, brought drummer Chris Daly in to replace the drum machine parts on Schwarzenbach's demos. The trio got along well and decided to form Jets to Brazil; they recorded a five-song demo tape and made their live debut in April 1998. With Lifetime's Peter Martin as the group's temporary second guitarist, they played shows in the US northeast, before touring across Europe with the Promise Ring for five weeks. The group's punk rock attitude, pop sensibilities and new wave aesthetic caught the attention of independent label Jade Tree. Schwarzenbach freed himself from a three-album contact with DGC, and signed to Jade Tree. Orange Rhyming Dictionary was recorded at Easley Studios in Memphis, Tennessee for two weeks in August 1998. It was produced by J. Robbins and engineered by Stuart Sikes. ==Composition== Orange Rhyming Dictionary saw a shift from the pop punk/punk rock sound of Jawbreaker into indie rock and post-hardcore territory, utilizing sparser song arrangements and thin vocal harmonies in place of Schwarzenbach's gritty voice. It retained the catchy choruses of pop punk, while being backed by the post-hardcore guitar work. The album, which drew comparisons to Gang of Four and Magazine, explored the feelings Schwarzenbach felt while he was in Jawbreaker during his period with DGC: fear, hope and doubt. Some of the songs tackle being a white- collar worker, drug addiction and spending time in hotel rooms; sung in third- person. It also addresses sustaining artistic integrity despite commercial expectations. Schwarzenbach fondness for longer songs laid the groundwork for the album; with \\"Accident Prone\\" and \\"Jet Black\\", both from Dear You, serving as the blueprint for most of Orange Rhyming Dictionary. \\"Crown of the Valley\\" opens with Schwarzenbach's Brit funk-indebted and wah-wah pedal-enhanced guitar line, which was backed by polyrhythmic drum parts. Prior to the chorus, the guitar shifts to minimalistic droning with only the drums being heard. This experimentation recalled the efforts heard on Dear You. The chorus features detuned string bending and jangling chord progressions. The art rock track \\"Morning New Disease\\" is followed by new wave number \\"Resistance Is Futile\\", which incorporates a synthesizer part that was reminiscent of Gary Numan. The track sees Chatelain channelling 1970s rock-esque backing vocals. Schwarzenbach's vocal on \\"Sea Anemone\\" and \\"Sweet Avenue\\" was compared to the crooning of the Psychedelic Furs frontman Richard Butler. \\"Sea Anemone\\" and \\"Conrad\\" tackled the theme of suicide. The introduction to \\"King Medicine\\" features harmonic guitar parts. \\"I Typed for Miles was inspired by a scene in the film Barton Fink (1991), and was compared to \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" by Nirvana. The album ends with the acoustic closing track \\"Sweet Avenue\\". ==Release and receptionPromotion and touring=== As the album was written with two guitars and a keyboard, they brought in former the Van Pelt guitarist Brian Maryansky to aid in performing the songs live. Maryansky had previously played with Daly in the early 1990s act Resurrection. Orange Rhyming Dictionary was released on October 27, 1998. Following this, the band toured across the US with the Promise Ring, leading up to a Japanese tour the following month. In early 1999, the band performed at South by Southwest, which Schwarzenbach later called \\"a train wreck.\\" In April, the band went a tour of the US with the midwest and east coast dates being supported by Euphone; the band took a month's break following this. Schwarzenbach spent the next few months visiting his uncle in Mexico and traveling on a boat ride to California. In September, the group performed at the Jade Tree/CMJ showcase in New York City, and a handful of east coast dates around this. The band had planned to return to Europe shortly after their April US tour, however, the dates were later rescheduled to November and December, with support from Euphone. In February 2000, the group went on an east coast tour, with support from the Americans and a few shows with Turing Machine. ===Critical response and legacy=== Orange Rhyming Dictionary received favorable reviews from music critics. AllMusic reviewer Mike DaRonco said the band \\"live up to their hype\\", nothing that the majority of the tracks \\"clock in at an epic length.\\" The releases \\"mood swings\\" vary from \\"laid-back and gloomy too upbeat and not as gloomy\\", while still being all in a good sort of way.\\" Cheryl Botchick of CMJ New Music Report said it managed to do a \\"rare accomplishment: The album actually picks up in speed, catchiness and fervor as it progresses.\\" Ink 19 writer Andrew Chadwick found the lyrics \\"the same, like an old friend with a fresh heartache\\"; adding that this was where the similarities with Jawbreaker ended. He noted that melodic punk of Jawbreaker had been swapped for \\"another evolution\\" that is \\"cleaner, less aggressive\\", yet \\"still emotionally powerful.\\" Ox-Fanzine Joachim Hiller said the record was \\"unlikely to disappoint anyone\\" of was a fan of the members' past work in their previous bands. He added that it was \\"hard and massive and edgy\\" with \\"loud\\" guitar work that was \\"just damn good.\\" Dave Clifford of SF Weekly wrote that the record \\"displays [Schwarzenbach's] reluctance to revisit his former role of coaxing angst from a wall of distorted guitars.\\" He mentioned Schwarzenbach was attempting to \\"remain true to himself while exploring different arteries ... which makes Orange Rhyming Dictionary something of a triumph.\\" Washington City Paper writer Colin Bane said the record \\"succeeds almost solely on the strength\\" of Schwarzenbach's \\"knack for always having something interesting to say and the language at his disposal to say it.\\" Orange Rhyming Dictionary eventually became the best-selling release in Jade Tree's history. It has appeared on a best-of emo list by Louder, a best-of 1990s list by Treblezine, and influential album lists by Buddy Nielsen of Senses Fail and Vinnie Caruana of the Movielife/I Am the Avalanche.

It was later recorded by (and was the eponym for) Motörhead, as he called it this instead of Bastard on his then manager's advice. ==Hawkwind versions== \\"Motorhead\\" was the last song that Lemmy wrote for Hawkwind before being fired from the band in May 1975. It was originally released as the B-side of the single \\"Kings of Speed\\" on United Artists Records in March 1975.Hawkwind Timeline . Simon King, Hawkwind and relations. Retrieved on 2007-03-07. The song was written in the Hyatt Hotel (a.k.a. 'Riot House') in West Hollywood, California. Lemmy explains how it was created: > I was on tour with Hawkwind in 1974, we were staying at the Riot House and > Roy Wood and Wizzard were also in town. I got this urge to write a song in > the middle of the night. I ran downstairs to the Wizzard room, got Roy's > Ovation acoustic guitar, then hurried back to mine. I went on to the balcony > and howled away for four hours. Cars were stopping and the drivers were > listening then driving off, and there I was yelling away at the top of my > voice.\\" - Lemmy. The title of the song is British slang for a speed freak. The lyrics were explained by Lemmy: > The six thousand miles was a reference to Los Angeles, and the rest is self- > explanatory. And yes, I am the only person to fit the word 'parallelogram' > into a rock'n'roll number! I'm very proud of that. The guitars and bass are tuned down a half-step on the Hawkwind version, effectively making the song's key E♭ Major, but are described here as if in standard tuning. The bass follows the root note for all the chords, with a riff on the F♯, based on the A string between the tenth and twelfth frets. The introduction is in E, ending with two bars each in D and E♭. The verse is in E with a D/E 'kick' at the end of each lyric line, a pre-chorus follows, in G with two lines ending in D, the last in F♯. The chorus, like the pre-chorus is in G, but with only two lines, ending in D and F♯. The song consists of three verses in total. There is a jazz-inspired violin solo break by keyboard player Simon House which, based on the verse/pre-chorus/chorus pattern, occurs after the second chorus. The original backing tracks for \\"Kings of Speed\\" were taken by Dave Brock from the Olympic Studios recording session, and he later added overdubs and re-released it through independent record companies. In July 1981 \\"Motorhead\\" was released as the A-side to a 7\\" and 12\\" single on the Flicknife label, this time having a Brock vocal and synthesizer overdubs, the B-side being \\"Valium Ten\\". Flicknife re-released the single as a 12\\" vinyl in October 1982. \\"Motorhead\\" was also used by Hawkwind on their 1986 single \\"Motorhead\\"/\\"Hurry on Sundown\\", released on Flicknife Records. From 1992 the song has been added to CD re-issues of Hawkwind's Warrior on the Edge of Time album. The song has also appeared on various compilation albums, such as British Tribal Music, The Hawkwind Collection and The Hawkwind Anthology Vol. II. ==Motörhead versions== The song was re-recorded by Lemmy's subsequent band Motörhead and released on their 1977 debut album, Motörhead. It was also chosen for release as a 7\\" vinyl single in June 1977, although it failed to chart. Recorded at Escape Studios, Kent, it was initially issued with the 'Map of Chiswick' label, later it was switched to the 'Big Beat' label and pressed in other formats.Burridge, Alan. Illustrated Collector's Guide to Motorhead. Published: 1995. Collector's Guide Publishing. . Chiswick also released a special 12\\" vinyl edition which was limited to 12,500 copies. In September 1979 Chiswick released a 7\\" vinyl picture disc in two pressings, black & white, and blue & white as well as single colour pressings in black, blue, pink, orange and white vinyl. The track \\"Motorhead\\" is credited to Lemmy, the B-side, \\"City Kids\\", to Duncan Sanderson and Larry Wallis. The band members in the recording were \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke on guitars and vocals, Phil \\"Philthy Animal\\" Taylor on drums, and Lemmy on bass and lead vocals. The single was produced by Speedy Keen and engineered by John Burns. The sleeve photographs are attributed to Motorcycle Irene. Motörhead recorded a live version, which was released as a 7\\" vinyl single on 11 July 1981. It fared much better than the original single and reached number six in the UK Singles Charts. Whereas the previous recording plays in E major, this recording plays in E♭. The single uses recordings made in March 1981 while the band were on their four- day \\"The Short, Sharp, Pain in the Neck Tour\\", as were the other tracks on the parent album, No Sleep 'til Hammersmith. Bronze Records released a 7\\" picture disc, the A-side has the same picture as the cover and the B-side has a white Motörhead logo on black. A promotional 12\\" vinyl single was released in the USA, with the album's \\"No Class\\" track as its B-side. This track has also been featured on unofficial releases, such as the 1993 Castle Communications double album compilation, All the Aces, and Deadline Music's 1999 Golden Years - The Alternate Versions, which was released under licence from Receiver Records. The track \\"Motorhead\\" is credited to Lemmy, the track \\"Over the Top\\" to Lemmy, \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke, and Phil \\"Philthy Animal\\" Taylor. The band members are the same as on the previous recording. In 1988 Castle Communications released a 3\\" CD single of four Motörhead tracks, the inserts states track three is \\"Motorhead\\" but actually plays \\"Jailbait\\", the edition was limited to 5,000 copies. In 2008, the song was re-recorded as downloadable content for the rhythm game Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, along with \\"Stay Clean\\" and \\"(We Are) The Road Crew\\". This re-recorded version appeared as a Japanese bonus track on the compilation Under Cöver, released in 2017. ==Other cover versions== *1981 - Cockney Rejects on Greatest Hits Vol. 3 - Live & Loud *1990 - Lawnmower Deth on Ooh Crikey It's...

It can be easily airlifted by helicopter, or dropped by parachute. It does not need a recoil pit. ==Development== M119 Howitzer as part of a training exercise conducted near Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan, on Sept. 17, 2004 The howitzer was designed and produced by the British Royal Ordnance Factories as the L118 light gun. In the L118 configuration, the 105 mm ammunition is cased separate loading ammunition (not semi-fixed projectile and propelling charge as sometimes stated). The L118 entered service with the British Army in 1976 and is used by parachute and commando field artillery regiments. It saw combat during the Falklands War, where the 30 guns in action fired up to 400 rounds per gun per day, mostly at \\"charge super\\"—i.e., the most powerful propellant charge available. The L119 is the L118 reconfigured to fire NATO-standard US/Nato 105 mm semi-fixed ammunition. In 1987 an agreement was reached to produce the L119 under license by the US as the M119, to replace the M102 howitzer. It entered service with 7th Infantry Division, Fort Ord, California, in December 1989. Some improvements were made to produce the M119A1, including increasing its extreme low temperate envelope from −30 °C to −45 °C, improving maintainability. The Army renewed contracts for the M119 to be produced by the Rock Island Arsenal-Joint Manufacturing & Technology Center (RIA-JMTC) at Rock Island, Illinois into the year 2013. The 105 mm M20A1 cannon was produced by US Army Watervliet Arsenal. The M119 is currently fielded with all Regular Army and National Guard infantry brigade combat teams, including those in the 10th Mountain, 82nd Airborne, and 101st Airborne divisions, and the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team. Other divisions may be of mixed composition between armor, Stryker, and infantry brigade combat teams, with armor having M109A6s Paladins and Stryker having M777s for their fires battalions. For example, two of four are IBCTs with M119s in the 25th Infantry Division. National Guard light field artillery battalions assigned to IBCTs also have M119s, for example the 86th IBCT (Mountain) headquartered in Vermont. It is routinely airdropped in airborne operations and sling-loaded under CH-47 Chinook or UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters in air assault operations. M119 slingloaded by UH-60 Blackhawk In April 2009, the M119A2 howitzer was being fielded by the 4th Infantry Combat Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division to provide better support in operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. It was the only brigade in the division equipped with it, as the other three brigades were \\"heavy\\" brigades and therefore equipped with the M109A6 Paladin. 105mm howitzer being fired by A Battery, 2-218th Field Artillery of Oregon Alpha Battery of the 1st Battalion, 320th Field Artillery Regiment, 101st Airborne Division received their first upgraded M119A3 howitzers in July 2013, and became the first unit to operate it in theater when they were deployed to northeast Afghanistan in early February 2014. The digitally upgraded M119A3 includes software and hardware component upgrades, GPS for navigation, a digital gunner's display, and digital communication between each gun and the fire direction center to speed up the process of receiving firing data and firing shells. Firing platoons were also equipped with larger, also digital M777A2 howitzers, and the M119A3 was more admired for being faster, lighter, and easier to change azimuth of fire. The A3-model retains manual capabilities of the A2-model, so occasions where digital capabilities were lost allowed crews to easily transition back to the analogue mode of operation and continue their missions.'Top Guns' fire first M119A3 in Afghanistan - FortCampbellcourier.com, 22 May 2014 Project Manager for Towed Artillery Systems (PM TAS) has developed several upgrades for the M119A3 including digital fire control, increased low temperature capability from , and the M20 breech. The recoil system is also being upgraded, as the legacy system had reliability issues with the recuperator, buffer, and variable recoil linkage (which sets recoil length based on elevation); it had a lot of moving parts needing constant maintenance and adjustment during operations with high replacement rates of spares that are complex to manufacture and require specialized tooling to assemble, increasing costs and causing availability problems. The redesigned system operates the same, but modifies and simplifies some components, including a new buffer and recuperator with a majority of the components removed, and adds the Suspension Lockout System (SLOS) that fixes recoil length at , which removes variable-recoil hardware, reduces stress on the carriage, and lowers buffer rod forces; the new system reduces cost, number of parts by 40 percent to 75, and overall weight by .M119 howitzer still plays critical role for Army - Army.mil, 9 September 2015 ==Ammunition== M119 in the Iraq War The M119A1 fires all standard NATO semi-fixed ammunition as well as special rocket-assisted projectiles, including: * M1 high explosive * M314 illuminating * M60/M60A2 smoke * M913 HERA range: 19.5 km * M760 HE range: 11.5 km * M1130A1 HE PFF BB range: 17 km\\"New ammunition combines four artillery cartridges into one\\", Army.mil, 14 November 2011 * M915 DPICM ==Prime mover== Soldiers with the 3rd Battalion, 7th Field Artillery Regiment, 25th Infantry Division (Light) position an M119A1 howitzer near Forward Operating Base Cobra, Afghanistan, 23 October 2004.

As a junior in 1989, he became the second player in NCAA Division I history to lead the nation in scoring and rebounding in the same season. Gathers was a consensus second-team All-American as a senior in 1990. His No. 44 was retired by the Lions, who also placed a statue of him in his honor outside their home arena Gersten Pavilion. Gathers began his college career with the USC Trojans, but transferred with teammate Bo Kimble to Loyola Marymount after his freshman year. Playing under Lions coach Paul Westhead and his fast-paced system, Gathers was a three-time first-team All-WCC selection. In his first season at Loyola Marymount University (LMU), he earned the first of two consecutive most valuable player (MVP) honors in the WCC Tournament. As a junior, he was named the WCC Player of the Year and began receiving All- American recognition. Early in his senior year in 1989–90, Gathers was diagnosed with an abnormal heartbeat after he collapsed during a game. He was placed on medication and returned a few weeks later, but he initially struggled, which he attributed to his medication. The dosage was gradually decreased, and his play recovered. Gathers died at age 23 after collapsing for the second time that season during the semifinals of the 1990 WCC Tournament. ==Early life== Gathers was born to Lucille and Eric Gathers Sr. in Philadelphia. Growing up in the Raymond Rosen Projects, one of the toughest neighborhoods in Philadelphia, he stayed out of trouble by playing basketball. Gathers played prep ball at Dobbins Technical High School, located among the housing projects in North Philadelphia. He was joined on the team by his younger brother, Derrick Gathers, Bo Kimble and Doug Overton. The Mustangs reached the Philadelphia Public League championship game in consecutive years, losing to a Pooh Richardson-led Benjamin Franklin High in 1984 before winning the title over Lionel Simmons' South Philadelphia High in 1985. ==College careerUSC=== Gathers and Kimble were not friends until their senior year at Dobbins. Both of them were recruited to the University of Southern California by head coach Stan Morrison and his top assistant David Spencer. During a visit to USC, the two recruits were told that the area around campus was deemed a slum. Gathers and Kimble, however, considered the area to be a suburb compared to their home of Philadelphia. Gathers made up his mind early that he would join USC, while Kimble decided independently and only after spurning Temple late. They were joined on the Trojans by high school All- American, Tom Lewis, and Rich Grande as the \\"Four Freshmen\\" star recruiting class.Harvey, Randy - Un-Raveling at USC: A Failure to Communicate.

It was reported that the players would not remain unless certain conditions were met, including having a say in the next coaching staff. USC hired George Raveling as the next head coach of the Trojans.Fleischman, Bill -Raveling Leaves Iowa To Take Reins At USC.

Sometimes you have to tell them that they have to exit.\\" Kimble and Gathers transferred together from USC to LMU. Lewis transferred to Pepperdine. Grande remained at USC. ===Loyola Marymount=== Due to NCAA regulations, Gathers and Kimble could not play in the season following their transfer. They helped lead the Lions to a 28–4 record in 1987–88. Gathers led the team that year in both scoring and rebounding (averaging 22.5 points and 8.7 rebounds per game), was named first-team All- WCC and was awarded the WCC Tournament MVP.Loyola 2010, p.77 In the 1988–89 season, Gathers became the second player in NCAA Division I history to lead the nation in scoring and rebounding in the same season, averaging 32.7 points and 13.7 rebounds per game. He was named WCC Player of the Year and again won the WCC Tournament MVP. On December 30, 1988, he scored a career-high 49 points along with 26 rebounds in a 130–125 win over Nevada. After the season, he decided against declaring for the NBA draft. As a senior in 1989–90, he was a candidate for national player of the year and projected as an NBA lottery pick. Gathers's head coach while at LMU, Paul Westhead, had instituted an extraordinarily fast-paced game plan. On offense, the Lions took numerous three-point shots, and typically shot the ball within 10 seconds of gaining possession. Their defense was a full-court press designed to force their opponents into a frenzied up-and-down game. Gathers's teams led Division I in scoring in 1988 (110.3 points per game), 1989 (112.5), and 1990 (122.4). LMU's 122.4 point per game in 1990 is still a record as of April 2012.NCAA 2010, p.5 As of April 2012, Loyola Marymount held the five highest combined score games in Division I history. Four of the five occurred during Gathers's career, including a record 331 in the 181–150 win over United States International University on January 31, 1989.NCAA 2010, pp.28–29 At and , Gathers was Loyola Marymount's strongest inside player. He had a high field goal percentage because he seldom shot from beyond . He used his power and quickness for follow-up baskets and scoring on fast breaks. \\"I don't care much about the points,\\" said Gathers. \\"In fact, I should lead the nation in scoring because of my rebounding. Anybody can score 30 points a night if that's what he's concentrating on. But rebounding is special because it comes from the heart.\\" ==Heart condition and death== On December 9, 1989, Gathers collapsed at an LMU home game against UC Santa Barbara. He was found to have an abnormal heartbeat (exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia), and was prescribed a beta blocker, Inderal. However, Gathers felt that the medication adversely affected his play, and his dosage was gradually cut back. Originally prescribed at 240 milligrams per day, his Inderal dosage was cut to 40 mg per day over the next three months. Gathers returned after sitting out for three weeks and missing two games, and he averaged 29.3 minutes and 29.15 points in his 20 games through the remainder of the season. However, he struggled with his play for weeks after returning. His play recovered in a nationally televised game against LSU on February 3, 1990, when he scored 48 points along with 13 rebounds while being guarded by future NBA first-round draft picks Stanley Roberts and Shaquille O'Neal in a 148–141 overtime loss. The Lions won seven of their next eight games, and Gathers recorded a career-high 30 rebounds against Saint Mary's. On February 26, 1990, as the WCC Tournament neared, Gathers's medication was reduced one last time from 80 to 40 mg, on the condition that he undergo testing in a couple of days to determine if it was safe and effective at suppressing the arrhythmias. He did not show up for his test that week and avoided calls from his cardiologist's office. On March 2, he had a long talk with the cardiologist, who told him to play and come in for the testing after the tournament concluded. It was later suspected Gathers was not taking any dosage on game days. The following day in the WCC tournament quarterfinals in Los Angeles, he recorded 28 points and 11 rebounds in a 121–84 win over Gonzaga. On Sunday, March 4, Gathers collapsed again with 13:34 left in the first half of the semifinal game against the Portland Pilots. He had just scored a dunk on an alley-oop pass from point guard Terrell Lowery that put the Lions up 25–13. Thirteen seconds later while positioned around midcourt in the Lions' fullcourt press, he collapsed a yard or two away from Pilots point guard Erik Spoelstra. He attempted to get up, telling the athletic trainers, \\"I don't want to lay down!\\" Shortly after, he stopped breathing.From the ESPN 30 for 30 film \\"Guru of Go\\", premiered April 3, 2010 Gathers was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital at 6:55 PM PST. He was 23 years old. Minutes after Gathers was taken to the hospital, the WCC commissioner suspended the game indefinitely. ESPN broadcast graphic footage of Gathers's collapse on SportsCenter; the network was at the game recording advance footage for the championship game it was scheduled to televise the next night. Late that night, the WCC canceled the tournament and awarded Loyola the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament due to its WCC regular season title. Gathers was buried at the Mount Lawn Cemetery in Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania. An autopsy found that he suffered from a heart-muscle disorder, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. His family later filed a $32.5 million lawsuit charging negligence. Loyola Marymount settled out of court for $1.4 million, while the cardiologist who treated Gathers settled for $1 million. ==Legacy== Loyola Marymount was placed in the West Regional as the No. 11 seed in that season's NCAA tournament. Before the tournament, the right-handed Kimble vowed to shoot his first free throw of each game left-handed, in memory of Gathers. Though naturally right-handed, Gathers was a poor free-throw shooter and had switched to shooting them left-handed. The Lions advanced to the Elite Eight, including a victory over defending national champion Michigan, before falling to the eventual champions, UNLV. Kimble finished a perfect 3-for-3 on his left-handed free throws during the tournament. Both LMU's Cinderella story without Gathers and Kimble's left-handed tributes to him became part of NCAA tournament lore. Gathers was named a consensus second- team All-America and first team All-WCC selection for the season. He finished his career averaging 28.0 points and making 59 percent of his field goals, which were both school records as of 2010. He also averaged 11.1 rebounds for his career. He was voted WCC Player of the Decade for the 1980s.Loyola 2010, p.78 Gersten Pavilion, LMU's on-campus athletics facility, is known to Lions fans as \\"Hank's House\\", although that is not part of its official name. His No. 44 and Kimble's No. 30 were retired by LMU in a joint ceremony in 2000. In 2005, the entire 1989–90 team was inducted into Loyola Marymount's Hall of Fame. On February 29, 2020, four days before the 30th anniversary of his death, a statue of Gathers was unveiled outside Gersten Pavilion. The statue was created by Rotblatt-Amrany, which designed multiple statues outside of the Staples Center in Los Angeles, as well as the Michael Jordan statue in Chicago. Gathers's life was dramatized in a 1992 TV movie, Final Shot: The Hank Gathers Story, with Victor Love starring as Gathers. Gathers was part of the storyline in the ESPN film Guru of Go about Westhead, part of their 30 for 30 series. Gathers's death reemerged in national news wires during the 2016 NBA Playoffs when Kimble, interviewed for the celebrity gossip website TMZ.com, urged that Miami Heat star Chris Bosh retire for health reasons. Bosh has been suffering from blood clotting issues that forced him to miss the last several months of both the 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons, as well as the entirety of the 2016–17 season. While Bosh felt that he was healthy enough to continue playing, Kimble disagreed: > There are so many other things he could do with his life.

Crump received a reported $1.5 million from Gathers's wrongful-death lawsuits. He gained control of the money when he turned 18. It became a problem for Crump, who later described himself as a \\"young black male with no guidance\\" at that time. He pleaded guilty to aggravated assault with a weapon, and was in a state prison from 2007 until 2012. Crump became a salesperson. He also mentors children through the Hank Gathers Legacy Group that he founded. Gathers's nephew, D. J. Rivera, played college basketball and led the America East Conference in scoring with the Binghamton Bearcats in 2008–09, when they won the conference for the first time and earned a bid to the NCAA tournament. Another nephew, Jordan Gathers, earned a bachelor's degree at St. Bonaventure University and played three seasons for their Bonnies basketball team from 2011 to 2014. He played a final season with Butler in 2015–16 as a graduate transfer. ==See also== *Sudden cardiac death of athletes *List of basketball players who died during their careers *List of NCAA Division I men's basketball season rebounding leaders *List of NCAA Division I men's basketball season scoring leaders *List of NCAA Division I men's basketball players with 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== *LMU Lions bio * *Remembering a fallen Lion, 20 years later *Stan Hochman: Hank Gathers still touching friends, strangers 20 years after his death *Poole: Hank Gathers had heart until he died, 20 years ago Thursday *March 4, 1990: Hank Gathers collapses, a day I will never forget as a reporter *Twenty Years After: Hank Gathers Stirs Memories for His Family Category:1967 births Category:1990 deaths Category:African-American basketball players Category:All-American college men's basketball players Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players from Pennsylvania Category:Burials in Pennsylvania Category:Deaths from cardiomyopathy Category:Filmed deaths in sports Category:Loyola Marymount Lions men's basketball players Category:Power forwards (basketball) Category:Sports deaths in California Category:Sportspeople from Philadelphia Category:USC Trojans men's basketball players ","title":"Hank Gathers"},{"id":"2235244","text":"Open-channel flow, a branch of hydraulics and fluid mechanics, is a type of liquid flow within a conduit or in channel with a free surface, known as a channel. The other type of flow within a conduit is pipe flow. These two types of flow are similar in many ways but differ in one important respect: the free surface. Open-channel flow has a free surface, whereas pipe flow does not. Central Arizona Project channel. ==Classifications of flow== Open-channel flow can be classified and described in various ways based on the change in flow depth with respect to time and space. The fundamental types of flow dealt with in open-channel hydraulics are: * Time as the criterion ** Steady flow *** The depth of flow does not change over time, or if it can be assumed to be constant during the time interval under consideration. ** Unsteady flow *** The depth of flow does change with time. * Space as the criterion ** Uniform flow *** The depth of flow is the same at every section of the channel. Uniform flow can be steady or unsteady, depending on whether or not the depth changes with time, (although unsteady uniform flow is rare). ** Varied flow *** The depth of flow changes along the length of the channel. Varied flow technically may be either steady or unsteady. Varied flow can be further classified as either rapidly or gradually-varied: **** Rapidly-varied flow ***** The depth changes abruptly over a comparatively short distance. Rapidly varied flow is known as a local phenomenon. Examples are the hydraulic jump and the hydraulic drop. **** Gradually-varied flow ***** The depth changes over a long distance. ** Continuous flow *** The discharge is constant throughout the reach of the channel under consideration. This is often the case with a steady flow. This flow is considered continuous and therefore can be described using the continuity equation for continuous steady flow. ** Spatially-varied flow *** The discharge of a steady flow is non-uniform along a channel. This happens when water enters and/or leaves the channel along the course of flow. An example of flow entering a channel would be a road side gutter. An example of flow leaving a channel would be an irrigation channel. This flow can be described using the continuity equation for continuous unsteady flow requires the consideration of the time effect and includes a time element as a variable. ==States of flow== The behavior of open-channel flow is governed by the effects of viscosity and gravity relative to the inertial forces of the flow. Surface tension has a minor contribution, but does not play a significant enough role in most circumstances to be a governing factor. Due to the presence of a free surface, gravity is generally the most significant driver of open-channel flow; therefore, the ratio of inertial to gravity forces is the most important dimensionless parameter. The parameter is known as the Froude number, and is defined as:\\\\text{Fr} = {U\\\\over{\\\\sqrt{gD}}}where U is the mean velocity, D is the characteristic length scale for a channel's depth, and g is the gravitational acceleration. Depending on the effect of viscosity relative to inertia, as represented by the Reynolds number, the flow can be either laminar, turbulent, or transitional. However, it is generally acceptable to assume that the Reynolds number is sufficiently large so that viscous forces may be neglected. == Core equations == It is possible to formulate equations describing three conservation laws for quantities that are useful in open-channel flow: mass, momentum, and energy. The governing equations result from considering the dynamics of the flow velocity vector field {\\\\bf v} with components {\\\\bf v} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} u & v & w \\\\end{pmatrix}^{T}. In Cartesian coordinates, these components correspond to the flow velocity in the x, y, and z axes respectively. To simplify the final form of the equations, it is acceptable to make several assumptions: # The flow is incompressible (this is not a good assumption for rapidly-varied flow) # The Reynolds number is sufficiently large such that viscous diffusion can be neglected # The flow is one- dimensional across the x-axis === Continuity equation === The general continuity equation, describing the conservation of mass, takes the form:{\\\\partial \\\\rho\\\\over{\\\\partial t}} + abla \\\\cdot (\\\\rho {\\\\bf v}) = 0where \\\\rho is the fluid density and abla \\\\cdot() is the divergence operator. Under the assumption of incompressible flow, with a constant control volume V, this equation has the simple expression abla \\\\cdot {\\\\bf v} = 0. However, it is possible that the cross-sectional area A can change with both time and space in the channel. If we start from the integral form of the continuity equation:{d\\\\over{dt}}\\\\int_{V}\\\\rho \\\\; dV = -\\\\int_{V} abla\\\\cdot(\\\\rho {\\\\bf v}) \\\\; dVit is possible to decompose the volume integral into a cross-section and length, which leads to the form:{d\\\\over{dt}}\\\\int_{x}\\\\left(\\\\int_{A}\\\\rho \\\\; dA \\\\right) dx = -\\\\int_{x}\\\\left[\\\\int_{A} abla\\\\cdot(\\\\rho {\\\\bf v}) \\\\; dA \\\\right] dxUnder the assumption of incompressible, 1D flow, this equation becomes:{d\\\\over{dt}}\\\\int_{x}\\\\left(\\\\int_{A}dA \\\\right) dx = -\\\\int_{x}{\\\\partial\\\\over{\\\\partial x}}\\\\left(\\\\int_{A} u \\\\; dA \\\\right) dxBy noting that \\\\int_{A}dA = A and defining the volumetric flow rate Q = \\\\int_{A}u \\\\; dA, the equation is reduced to:\\\\int_{x}{\\\\partial A\\\\over{\\\\partial t}} \\\\; dx = -\\\\int_{x}{\\\\partial Q\\\\over{\\\\partial x}} dxFinally, this leads to the continuity equation for incompressible, 1D open-channel flow:{\\\\partial A\\\\over{\\\\partial t}} + {\\\\partial Q\\\\over{\\\\partial x}} = 0 === Momentum equation === The momentum equation for open-channel flow may be found by starting from the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations :\\\\overbrace{\\\\underbrace{{\\\\partial {\\\\bf v}\\\\over{\\\\partial t}}}_{\\\\begin{smallmatrix} \\\\text{Local} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{Change} \\\\end{smallmatrix}} + \\\\underbrace{{\\\\bf v}\\\\cdot abla {\\\\bf v}}_{\\\\text{Advection}}}^{\\\\text{Inertial Acceleration}} = -\\\\underbrace{{1\\\\over{\\\\rho}} abla p}_{\\\\begin{smallmatrix} \\\\text{Pressure} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{Gradient} \\\\end{smallmatrix}} + \\\\underbrace{ u \\\\Delta {\\\\bf v}}_{\\\\text{Diffusion}} - \\\\underbrace{ abla \\\\Phi}_{\\\\text{Gravity}} + \\\\underbrace_{\\\\begin{smallmatrix} \\\\text{External} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{Forces} \\\\end{smallmatrix}}where p is the pressure, u is the kinematic viscosity, \\\\Delta is the Laplace operator, and \\\\Phi = gz is the gravitational potential. By invoking the high Reynolds number and 1D flow assumptions, we have the equations:\\\\begin{aligned} {\\\\partial u\\\\over{\\\\partial t}} + u{\\\\partial u\\\\over{\\\\partial x}} &= -{1\\\\over{\\\\rho}}{\\\\partial p\\\\over{\\\\partial x}} + F_{x} \\\\\\\\\\\\ -{1\\\\over{\\\\rho}}{\\\\partial p\\\\over{\\\\partial z}} - g &= 0 \\\\end{aligned}The second equation implies a hydrostatic pressure p = \\\\rho g \\\\zeta, where the channel depth \\\\eta(t,x) = \\\\zeta(t,x) - z_{b}(x) is the difference between the free surface elevation \\\\zeta and the channel bottom z_{b}. Substitution into the first equation gives:{\\\\partial u\\\\over{\\\\partial t}} + u{\\\\partial u\\\\over{\\\\partial x}} + g{\\\\partial \\\\zeta\\\\over{\\\\partial x}} = F_{x} \\\\implies {\\\\partial u\\\\over{\\\\partial t}} + u{\\\\partial u\\\\over{\\\\partial x}} + g{\\\\partial \\\\eta\\\\over{\\\\partial x}} - gS = F_{x}where the channel bed slope S = -dz_{b}/dx. To account for shear stress along the channel banks, we may define the force term to be:F_{x} = -{1\\\\over{\\\\rho}}{\\\\tau\\\\over{R}}where \\\\tau is the shear stress and R is the hydraulic radius. Defining the friction slope S_{f} = \\\\tau/\\\\rho g R, a way of quantifying friction losses, leads to the final form of the momentum equation:{\\\\partial u\\\\over{\\\\partial t}} + u{\\\\partial u\\\\over{\\\\partial x}} + g{\\\\partial \\\\eta\\\\over{\\\\partial x}} + g(S_{f}- S) = 0 === Energy equation === To derive an energy equation, note that the advective acceleration term {\\\\bf v}\\\\cdot abla {\\\\bf v} may be decomposed as:{\\\\bf v}\\\\cdot abla {\\\\bf v} = \\\\omega \\\\times {\\\\bf v} + {1\\\\over{2}} abla\\\\{\\\\bf v}\\\\^{2}where \\\\omega is the vorticity of the flow and \\\\\\\\cdot\\\\ is the Euclidean norm. This leads to a form of the momentum equation, ignoring the external forces term, given by:{\\\\partial {\\\\bf v}\\\\over{\\\\partial t}} + \\\\omega \\\\times {\\\\bf v} = - abla\\\\left({1\\\\over{2}}\\\\{\\\\bf v}\\\\^{2} + {p\\\\over{\\\\rho}} + \\\\Phi \\\\right )Taking the dot product of {\\\\bf v} with this equation leads to:{\\\\partial\\\\over{\\\\partial t}}\\\\left({1\\\\over{2}}\\\\{\\\\bf v}\\\\^{2} \\\\right ) + {\\\\bf v}\\\\cdot abla \\\\left({1\\\\over{2}}\\\\{\\\\bf v}\\\\^{2} + {p\\\\over{\\\\rho}} + \\\\Phi \\\\right ) = 0This equation was arrived at using the scalar triple product {\\\\bf v}\\\\cdot (\\\\omega \\\\times {\\\\bf v}) = 0. Define E to be the energy density:E = \\\\underbrace{{1\\\\over{2}}\\\\rho\\\\{\\\\bf v} \\\\^{2} }_{\\\\begin{smallmatrix} \\\\text{Kinetic} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{Energy} \\\\end{smallmatrix}} + \\\\underbrace{\\\\rho\\\\Phi}_{\\\\begin{smallmatrix} \\\\text{Potential} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{Energy} \\\\end{smallmatrix}}Noting that \\\\Phi is time-independent, we arrive at the equation:{\\\\partial E\\\\over{\\\\partial t}} + {\\\\bf v}\\\\cdot abla (E+p) = 0Assuming that the energy density is time-independent and the flow is one-dimensional leads to the simplification:E + p = Cwith C being a constant; this is equivalent to Bernoulli's principle. Of particular interest in open-channel flow is the specific energy e = E/\\\\rho g, which is used to compute the hydraulic head h that is defined as:\\\\begin{aligned} h &= e + {p\\\\over{\\\\rho g}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= {u^{2}\\\\over{2g}} + z + {p\\\\over{\\\\gamma}} \\\\end{aligned}with \\\\gamma = \\\\rho g being the specific weight. However, realistic systems require the addition of a head loss term h_{f} to account for energy dissipation due to friction and turbulence that was ignored by discounting the external forces term in the momentum equation. ==See also== *HEC-RAS *Streamflow *Fields of study **Computational fluid dynamics **Fluid dynamics **Hydraulics **Hydrology *Types of fluid flow **Laminar flow **Pipe flow **Transitional flow **Turbulent flow *Fluid properties **Froude number **Reynolds number **Viscosity *Other related articles **Chézy formula **Darcy-Weisbach equation **Hydraulic jump **Manning formula **Saint-Venant equations **Standard step method ==References== == Further reading == * Nezu, Iehisa; Nakagawa, Hiroji (1993).

He served as Vicar General of Rome from 1965 to 1968, and Dean of the College of Cardinals from 1974 until his death. Traglia was elevated to the cardinalate in 1960. ==Life and career in Church== Traglia was born in Albano Laziale, and studied at the Pontifical Lateran University and Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. He was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Basilio Pompili on 10 August 1917, and then finished his studies in 1919. While teaching at the Pontifical Urbaniana University from 1919 to 1936, Traglia was also an official of the Sacred Congregations of Seminaries and Universities and of the Propagation of the Faith from 1927 to 1930. On 18 August 1930, he became assessor and subpromoter-general of the faith in the latter congregation. He was raised to the rank of Domestic Prelate of His Holiness on 22 February 1932, and later Auditor of the Roman Rota on 17 September 1936. On 21 December 1936, Mgr Traglia was appointed Vicar General of The Diocese of Rome and Titular Archbishop of Caesarea in Palaestina. He received his episcopal consecration on 6 January 1937, from Cardinal Francesco Marchetti-Selvaggiani, with Archbishop Domenico Spolverini and Bishop Angelo Calabretta serving as co-consecrators, in the Lateran Basilica. Traglia was later named President of the Special Committee for the Marian Holy Year on 7 October 1953, and of the Commission for the first Roman synod in 1959. He was created Cardinal-Priest of S. Andrea della Valle by Pope John XXIII in the consistory of 28 March 1960. Pope Paul VI later changed Traglia's titular church to that of San Lorenzo in Damaso on 28 April 1969. On 15 March 1972, he was elevated to Cardinal Bishop of Albano. From 1962 to 1965, Cardinal Traglia participated in the Second Vatican Council, during the course of which he served as a cardinal elector in the 1963 papal conclave that selected Pope Paul VI. He was named Vicar General of Rome on 30 March 1965. In this position, the Cardinal governed the diocese in the name of the Pope, who is the Bishop of Rome. After resigning as Cardinal Vicar on 9 January 1968, Traglia was appointed Apostolic Chancellor on the following 13 January. He resigned the post on 7 February 1973, not long before the office was abolished on 27 February of that same year. Traglia was elected and confirmed as Vice- Dean of the College of Cardinals on 24 March 1972, later ascending to Dean of the College of Cardinals and thus Cardinal Bishop of Ostia, while retaining his previous suburbicarian title, on 7 January 1974. On 24 December of that same year, he served as papal legate to the opening of the Holy Door at the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls.

He was briefly the Officer commanding of the IRA's Dublin Brigade and was interned in 1923. During this period he was also involved with the first Communist Party of Ireland. Fitzpatrick was a full-time official of the Grocers' trade union and secretary of its social club at the Banba Hall in Dublin's Parnell Square. He also managed the Balalaika Ballroom and restaurant in the same area. He was the central figure in IRA contacts with the Soviet Union during the late 1920s and in 1927, he attended the first International Congress of the Friends of Soviet Russia (FOSR) in Moscow. In 1928 he helped establish an Irish section of the FOSR. During 1929 he was involved in launching the Irish Labour Defence League and the Workers' Revolutionary Party of Ireland. He was also involved in Comhairle na Poblachta, a body set up the same year to heal the rift between the military and political anti-Treaty forces in Ireland. He visited the Soviet Union again in 1932. Fitzpatrick chaired the 1933 IRA General Army Convention (GAC). At the 1934 GAC he disagreed with the call for a Republican Congress and remained within the IRA. His union was involved in a strike with O'Mara's Bacon Shops in late 1934 in which the IRA intervened violently. During 1935 he was involved in the IRA's intervention in the Dublin transport strike. In 1936 he was an unsuccessful candidate for Cumann Poblachta na hÉireann, a political party set up by the IRA. Fitzpatrick succeeded Tom Barry as chief of staff in 1937, only to be ousted by Seán Russell at the 1938 GAC. He was involved in the launch of the Clann na Poblachta political party in 1946 and was a member of its national executive. At the 1948 general election, he was elected as a TD for Dublin North-West, winning 2,395 votes (10.3%). At the 1951 general election, he received 458 votes (1.9%) and lost his seat. ==References== ==Further reading== *Brian Hanley, The IRA. 1926–1936, Dublin (Four Courts Press), 2002.

It is one of Bangalore's newer areas. It is bounded by the Ulsoor to the west, Domlur to the south, Byappanahalli to the north and Vimanapura to the east. Indiranagar is one of the most expensive localities in Bangalore. ==History== Indiranagar was formed as a BDA layout in the late 1970s, and was named after the former Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi. In the beginning, the locality was primarily a suburb, dotted with large bungalows and independent houses, mostly owned by defence personnel and public sector employees. Jack & Jones store The Information Technology boom in Bengaluru in the late 1990s converted Indiranagar and its two arterial roads (100 Feet Road and Chinmaya Mission Hospital Road) into a semi-commercial area. Today, Indiranagar is an important residential and commercial hub of Bengaluru.Hundred Feet Road, Indiranagar Indiranagar is divided into 2 stages, with the 1st stage being the largest. The villages which existed prior to the formation of Indiranagar such as Binnamangala, Lakshmipuram, Motappanapalya, Appareddy Palya, Doopanahalli, Kodihalli and Thippasandra as well as the neighbouring BDA layouts such as HAL 2nd Stage and HAL 3rd Stage are often considered as a part of Indiranagar. ==Community== The Indiranagar Sangeetha Sabha organizes Music & Dance programs. It also conducts promotional activities, seminars, puppet shows and annual cultural programs like vocal and instrumental music concerts. Sangeetha Sabha constructed Purandhara Bhavan which promotes performing arts, theater and drama. Close to the Sangeetha Sabha one can find the Indiranagar Club spread across 2.5 acres of land. Membership fee is high at 10 lakh rupees and the club boasts of some of the best gym and work out equipment, yoga clubs, tennis courts, basketball ground, billiards tables, an exclusive cards room and a small library. Indiranagar has the Defence Colony Playground, located next to the Defence Colony Children's Park and the Old People's Park; the Defence Colony Park maintained by DECORA is close by. There are three big schools: National Public School, The Frank Anthony Public School and New Horizon Public School within the residential locality, as well as the Sri Rakum School for the Blind. On top of this, Indiranagar is also famous for having 100 ft. road, which has several high end fashion brands as well as bars and pubs.

Consequently, a successful endeavor (subject to this principle) is one where every possible deficiency has been avoided. The name of the principle derives from Leo Tolstoy's 1877 novel Anna Karenina, which begins: In other words: happy families share a common set of attributes which lead to happiness, while any of a variety of attributes can cause an unhappy family. This concept has been generalized to apply to several fields of study. In statistics, the term Anna Karenina principle is used to describe significance tests: there are any number of ways in which a dataset may violate the null hypothesis and only one in which all the assumptions are satisfied. ==ExamplesFailed domestication=== The Anna Karenina principle was popularized by Jared Diamond in his 1997 book Guns, Germs and Steel. Diamond uses this principle to illustrate why so few wild animals have been successfully domesticated throughout history, as a deficiency in any one of a great number of factors can render a species undomesticable. Therefore, all successfully domesticated species are not so because of a particular positive trait, but because of a lack of any number of possible negative traits. In chapter 9, six groups of reasons for failed domestication of animals are defined: * Diet – To be a candidate for domestication, a species must be easy to feed. Finicky eaters make poor candidates. Non-finicky omnivores make the best candidates. * Growth rate – The animal must grow fast enough to be economically feasible. Elephant farmers, for example, would wait perhaps twelve years for their herd to reach adult size. * Captive breeding – The species must breed well in captivity. Species having mating rituals prohibiting breeding in a farm-like environment make poor candidates for domestication. These rituals could include the need for privacy or long, protracted mating chases. * Disposition – Some species are too ill-tempered to be good candidates for domestication. Farmers must not be at risk of life or injury every time they enter the animal pen. The zebra is of special note in the book, as it was recognized by local cultures and Europeans alike as extremely valuable and useful to domesticate, but it proved impossible to tame. Horses in Africa proved to be susceptible to disease and attack by a wide variety of animals, while the very characteristics that made the zebra hardy and survivable in the harsh environment of Africa also made it fiercely independent. * Tendency to panic – Species are genetically predisposed to react to danger in different ways. A species that immediately takes flight is a poor candidate for domestication. A species that freezes, or mingles with the herd for cover in the face of danger, is a good candidate. Deer in North America have proven almost impossible to domesticate and have difficulty breeding in captivity. In contrast, horses thrived from when they were re- introduced to North America in the sixteenth century. * Social structure – Species of lone, independent animals make poor candidates. A species that has a strong, well-defined social hierarchy is more likely to be domesticated. A species that can imprint on a human as the head of the hierarchy is best. Different social groups must also be tolerant of one another. ==Ecological risk assessment== Ecologist Dwayne Moore describes applications of the Anna Karenina principle in ecology: ==Aristotle's version== Much earlier, Aristotle states the same principle in the Nicomachean Ethics (Book 2):Aristotle.

The second law of thermodynamics states that any organized state in an isolated system spontaneously evolves to a maximum-entropy state, for which there are many more options. ==Order in chaos of maladaptation== Many experiments and observations of groups of humans, animals, trees, grassy plants, stockmarket prices, and changes in the banking sector proved the modified Anna Karenina principle. This effect is proved for many systems: from the adaptation of healthy people to a change in climate conditions to the analysis of fatal outcomes in oncological and cardiological clinics. The same effect is found in the stock market. The applicability of these two statistical indicators of stress, simultaneous increase of variance and correlations, for diagnosis of social stress in large groups was examined in the prolonged stress period preceding the 2014 Ukrainian economic and political crisis.

Explorer 57) was an astronomical observatory satellite primarily designed to take ultraviolet spectra. The satellite was a collaborative project between NASA, the UK Science Research Council and the European Space Agency (ESA). The mission was first proposed in early 1964, by a group of scientists in the United Kingdom, and was launched on January 26, 1978 aboard a NASA Delta rocket. The mission lifetime was initially set for 3 years, but in the end it lasted almost 18 years, with the satellite being shut down in 1996. The switch-off occurred for financial reasons, while the telescope was still functioning at near original efficiency. It was the first space observatory to be operated in real time by astronomers who visited the groundstations in the United States and Europe. Astronomers made over 104,000 observations using the IUE, of objects ranging from solar system bodies to distant quasars. Among the significant scientific results from IUE data were the first large scale studies of stellar winds, accurate measurements of the way interstellar dust absorbs light, and measurements of the supernova SN1987A which showed that it defied stellar evolution theories as they then stood. When the mission ended, it was considered the most successful astronomical satellite ever.ESA Science & Technology: Summary. Sci.esa.int. Retrieved on 2011-08-27. ==HistoryMotivation=== The human eye can perceive light with wavelengths between roughly 350 (violet) and 700 (red) nanometres. Ultraviolet light has wavelengths between roughly 10 nm and 350 nm. UV light can be harmful to human beings, and is strongly absorbed by the ozone layer. This makes it impossible to observe UV emission from astronomical objects from the ground. Many types of object emit copious quantities of UV radiation, though: the hottest and most massive stars in the universe can have surface temperatures high enough that the vast majority of their light is emitted in the UV. Active Galactic Nuclei, accretion disks, and supernovae all emit UV radiation strongly, and many chemical elements have strong absorption lines in the UV, so that UV absorption by the interstellar medium provides a powerful tool for studying its composition. UV astronomy was impossible before the Space Age, and some of the first space telescopes were UV telescopes designed to observe this previously inaccessible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. One particular success was the second Orbiting Astronomical Observatory, which had a number of 20 cm UV telescopes on board. It was launched in 1968, and took the first UV observations of 1200 objects, mostly stars. The success of OAO-2 motivated astronomers to consider larger missions. ===Conception=== A shell of a control and display unit for the International Ultraviolet explorer satellite, preserved in the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. The orbiting ultraviolet satellite which ultimately became the IUE mission was first proposed in 1964 by British astronomer Robert Wilson. The European Space Research Organisation was planning a Large Astronomical Satellite, and had sought proposals from the astronomical community for its aims and design. Wilson headed a British team which proposed an ultraviolet spectrograph, and their design was recommended for acceptance in 1966. However, management problems and cost overruns led to the cancellation of the LAS program in 1968. Wilson's team scaled down their plans and submitted a more modest proposal to ESRO, but this was not selected as the Cosmic Ray satellite was given precedence. Rather than give up on the idea of an orbiting UV telescope, they instead sent their plans to NASA administrator Leo Goldberg, and in 1973 the plans were approved. The proposed telescope was renamed the International Ultraviolet Explorer.Sir Robert Wilson 1927–2002 . Blackwell Synergy. Obituaries ===Design and aims=== The telescope was designed from the start to be operated in real time, rather than by remote control. This required that it would be launched into a geosynchronous orbit – that is, one with a period equal to one sidereal day of 23h 56m. A satellite in such an orbit remains visible from a given point on the Earth's surface for many hours at a time, and can thus transmit to a single ground station for a long period of time. Most space observatories in Earth orbit, such as the Hubble Space Telescope, are in a low orbit in which they spend most of their time operating autonomously because only a small fraction of the Earth's surface can see them at a given time. Hubble, for example, orbits the Earth at an altitude of approximately 600 km, while a geosynchronous orbit has an average altitude of 36,000 km. As well as allowing continuous communication with ground stations, a geosynchronous orbit also allows a larger portion of the sky to be viewed continuously. Because the distance from Earth is greater, the Earth occupies a much smaller portion of the sky as seen from the satellite than it does from low Earth orbit. A launch into a geosynchronous orbit requires much more energy for a given weight of payload than a launch into low Earth orbit. This meant that the telescope had to be relatively small, with a 45 cm primary mirror, and a total weight of 312 kg. Hubble, in comparison, weighs 11.1 tonnes and has a 2.4 m mirror. The largest ground- based telescope, the Gran Telescopio Canarias, has a primary mirror 10.4 m across. A smaller mirror means less light-gathering power, and less spatial resolution, compared to a larger mirror. The stated aims of the telescope at the start of the mission were:ESA Science & Technology: Objectives. Sci.esa.int (2003-07-09). Retrieved on 2011-08-07. * To obtain high-resolution spectra of stars of all spectral types to determine their physical characteristics * To study gas streams in and around binary star system * To observe faint stars, galaxies and quasars at low resolution, interpreting these spectra by reference to high-resolution spectra * To observe the spectra of planets and comets * To make repeated observations of objects with variable spectra * To study the modification of starlight caused by interstellar dust and gas ===Construction and engineering=== The core of the science hardware of the IUE. The telescope tube and sunshade extend above the pivot point of the support stand, the cameras are just below, and some of the mirrors and diffraction gratings are at the bottom. The box extending from the midpoint of the assembly covers the location of the spacecraft gyros. Simplified optical diagram of the telescope The telescope was constructed as a joint project between NASA, ESRO (which became ESA in 1975) and the UK Science and Engineering Research Council. SERC provided the Vidicon cameras for the spectrographs as well as software for the scientific instruments. ESA provided the solar arrays to power the spacecraft as well as a ground observing facility in Villafranca del Castillo, Spain. NASA contributed the telescope, spectrograph, and spacecraft as well as launching facilities and a second ground observatory in Greenbelt, Maryland at the Goddard Space Flight Center. According to the agreement setting up the project the observing time would be divided between the contributing agencies with 2/3 to NASA, 1/6 to ESA and 1/6 to the UK's Science Research Council. ===Mirror=== The telescope mirror was a reflector of the Ritchey-Chretien type, which has hyperbolic primary and secondary mirrors. The primary was 45 cm across. The telescope was designed to give high quality images over a 16 arcminute field of view (about half the apparent diameter of the Sun or Moon). The primary mirror was made of beryllium, and the secondary of fused silica – materials chosen for their light weight, moderate cost, and optical quality. ===Instruments=== Fully assembled IUE with the telescope tube on top and solar panel extended The instrumentation on board consisted of the Fine Error Sensors (FES), which were used for pointing and guiding the telescope, a high resolution and a low resolution spectrograph, and four detectors. There were two Fine Error Sensors (FES), and their first purpose was to image the field of view of the telescope in visible light. They could detect stars down to 14th magnitude, about 1500 times fainter than can be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The image was transmitted to the ground station, where the observer would verify that the telescope was pointing at the correct field, and then acquire the exact object to be observed. If the object to be observed was fainter than 14th magnitude, the observer would point the telescope at a star that could be seen, and then apply \\"blind\\" offsets, determined from the coordinates of the objects. The accuracy of the pointing was generally better than 2 arcseconds for blind offsets3.6 Blind Offsets and Faint Object Acquisition. Archive.stsci.edu (1996-09-30). Retrieved on 2011-08-07. The FES acquisition images were the telescope's only imaging capability; for UV observations, it only recorded spectra. For this, it was equipped with two spectrographs. They were called the Short Wavelength Spectrograph and the Long Wavelength Spectrograph, and covered wavelength ranges of 115 to 200 nanometres and 185 to 330 nm respectively. Each spectrograph had both high and low resolution modes, with spectral resolutions of 0.02 and 0.6 nm respectively.MAST IUE Scientific Instrument. Archive.stsci.edu (2007-01-09). Retrieved on 2011-08-07. The spectrographs could be used with either of two apertures. The larger aperture was a slot with a field of view roughly 10 × 20 arcsec; the smaller aperture was a circle about 3 arcsec in diameter. The quality of the telescope optics was such that point sources appeared about 3 arcsec across, so use of the smaller aperture required very accurate pointing, and it did not necessarily capture all of the light from the object. The larger aperture was therefore most commonly used, and the smaller aperture only used when the larger field of view would have contained unwanted emission from other objects. There were two cameras for each spectrograph, one designated the primary and the second being redundant in case of failure of the first. The cameras were named LWP, LWR, SWP and SWR where P stands for prime, R for redundant and LW/SW for long/short wavelength. The cameras were television cameras, sensitive only to visible light, and light gathered by the telescope and spectrographs first fell on a UV-to-visible converter. This was a caesium-tellurium cathode, which was inert when exposed to visible light, but which gave off electrons when struck by UV photons due to the photoelectric effect. The electrons were then detected by the TV cameras. The signal could be integrated for up to many hours, before being transmitted to Earth at the end of the exposure. ==Mission== Delta 2914 launching IUE spacecraft on Jan. 26, 1978 from Cape Canaveral ===Launch=== The IUE was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on a Delta rocket, on 26 January 1978.MAST IUE Early History. Archive.stsci.edu. Retrieved on 2011-08-07. It was launched into a transfer orbit, from which its on-board rockets fired it into its planned geosynchronous orbit. The orbit was inclined by 28.6° to the Earth's equator, and had an orbital eccentricity of 0.24, meaning that the satellite's distance from Earth varied between 25,669 km and 45,887 km. The ground track was initially centred at a longitude of approximately 70 degrees W. ===Commissioning=== The first 60 days of the mission were designated as the commissioning period. This was divided into three main stage. Firstly, as soon as its instruments were switched on, the IUE observed a small number of high priority objects, to ensure that some data had been taken in the event of an early failure. The first spectrum, of the star Eta Ursae Majoris, was taken for calibration purposes three days after launch. The first science observations targeted objects including the Moon, the planets from Mars to Uranus, hot stars including Eta Carinae, cool giant stars including Epsilon Eridani, the black hole candidate Cygnus X-1, and galaxies including M81 and M87. Then, the spacecraft systems were tested and optimised. The telescope was focussed, and the prime and redundant cameras in both channels were tested. It was found that the SWR camera did not work properly, and so the SWP camera was used throughout the mission. Initially, this camera suffered from significant electronic noise, but this was traced to a sensor used to align the telescope after launch. Once this sensor was switched off, the camera performed as expected. The cameras were then adjusted for best performance, and the slewing and guiding performance of the telescope evaluated and optimised Finally, image quality and spectral resolution were studied and characterised, and the performance of the telescope, spectrographs and cameras were calibrated using observations of well-known stars. After these three phases were completed, the \\"routine phase\\" of operations began on 3 April 1978. Optimisation, evaluation and calibration operations were far from complete, but the telescope was understood well enough for routine science observations to begin. ==Usage== Comet IRAS–Araki–Alcock was the 7th comet discovered in 1983. This figure combines an FES image showing its diffuse tail and the long-wavelength redundant (LWR) spectrum depicting the molecular emission lines of sulfur (S2) and hydroxyl (OH). Use of the telescope was divided between NASA, ESA and SERC in approximate proportion to their relative contributions to the satellite construction: two thirds of the time was available to NASA, and one sixth each to ESA and SERC. Telescope time was obtained by submitting proposals, which were reviewed annually. Each of the three agencies considered applications separately for its allocated observing time.Index of /iue/newsletters/Vol05. Archive.stsci.edu (2007-01-09). Retrieved on 2011-08-07. Astronomers of any nationality could apply for telescope time, choosing whichever agency they preferred to apply to. If an astronomer was awarded time, then when their observations were scheduled, they would travel to the ground stations which operated the satellite, so that they could see and evaluate their data as it was taken. This mode of operation was very different from most space facilities, for which data is taken with no real time input from the astronomer concerned, and instead resembled the use of ground-based telescopes. ===Ground support=== For most of its lifetime, the telescope was operated in three eight-hour shifts each day, two from the US ground station at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, and one from the ESA ground station at Villanueva de la Cañada near Madrid.ESA Science & Technology: Ground Operations. Sci.esa.int. Retrieved on 2011-08-07. Because of its elliptical orbit, the spacecraft spent part of each day in the Van Allen belts, during which time science observations suffered from higher background noise. This time occurred during the second US shift each day, and was generally used for calibration observations and spacecraft 'housekeeping', as well as for science observations that could be done with short exposure times.IUE Operations in Detail. Archive.stsci.edu. Retrieved on 2011-08-07. The twice-daily transatlantic handovers required telephone contact between Spain and the US to coordinate the switch. Observations were not coordinated between the stations, so that the astronomers taking over after the handover would not know where the telescope would be pointing when their shift started. This sometimes meant that observing shifts started with a lengthy pointing manoeuvre, but allowed maximum flexibility in scheduling of observing blocks. ===Data transmission=== Data was transmitted to Earth in real time at the end of each science observation. The camera read-out formed an image of 768×768 pixels, and the analogue-to-digital converter resulted in a dynamic range of 8 bits. The data was then transmitted to Earth via one of six transmitters on the spacecraft; four were S-band transmitters, placed at points around the spacecraft such that no matter what its attitude, one could transmit to the ground, and two were VHF transmitters, which could sustain a lower bandwidth, but consumed less power, and also transmitted in all directions. The VHF transmitters were used when the spacecraft was in the Earth's shadow and thus reliant on battery power instead of solar power. In normal operations, observers could hold the telescope in position and wait approximately 20 minutes for the data to be transmitted, if they wanted the option of repeating the observation, or they could slew to the next target and then start the data transmission to Earth while observing the next target. The data transmitted were used for \\"quick look\\" purposes only, and full calibration was carried out by IUE staff later. Astronomers were then sent their data on magnetic tape by post, about a week after processing. From the date of the observation, the observers had a six-month proprietary period during which only they had access to the data. After six months, it became public.IUE Newsletter No. 47 – IUE Observing Guide. Archive.stsci.edu. Retrieved on 2011-08-27. ==Scientific results== IUE observations chart on a projection map of entire sky. The IUE allowed astronomers their first view of the ultraviolet light from many celestial objects, and was used to study objects ranging from Solar System planets to distant quasars. During its lifetime, hundreds of astronomers observed with IUE, and during its first decade of operations, over 1500 peer reviewed scientific articles based on IUE data were published. Nine symposia of the International Astronomical Union were devoted to discussions of IUE results.Astrophysical contributions of the International Ultraviolet Explorer, 1989, ARA&A;, 27, 397 ===Solar system=== All the planets in the Solar System except Mercury were observed; the telescope could not point at any part of the sky within 45° of the Sun, and Mercury's greatest angular distance from the Sun is only about 28°. IUE observations of Venus showed that the amount of sulfur monoxide and sulfur dioxide in its atmosphere declined by a large amount during the 1980s. The reason for this decline is not yet fully understood, but one hypothesis is that a large volcanic eruption had injected sulfur compounds into the atmosphere, and that they were declining following the end of the eruption. Halley's Comet reached perihelion in 1986, and was observed intensively with the IUE, as well as with a large number of other ground-based and satellite missions. UV spectra were used to estimate the rate at which the comet lost dust and gas, and the IUE observations allowed astronomers to estimate that a total of 3×108 tons of water evaporated from the comet during its passage through the inner Solar System. ===Stars=== Some of the most significant results from IUE came in the studies of hot stars. A star that is hotter than about 10,000 K emits most of its radiation in the UV, and thus if it can only be studied in visible light, a large amount of information is being lost. The vast majority of all stars are cooler than the Sun, but the fraction that is hotter includes massive, highly luminous stars which shed enormous quantities of matter into interstellar space, and also white dwarf stars, which are the end stage of stellar evolution for the vast majority of all stars and which have temperatures as high as 100,000 K when they first form. The IUE discovered many instances of white dwarf companions to main sequence stars. An example of this kind of system is Sirius, and at visible wavelengths the main sequence star is far brighter than the white dwarf. However, in the UV, the white dwarf can be as bright or brighter, as its higher temperature means it emits most of its radiation at these shorter wavelengths. In these systems, the white dwarf was originally the heavier star, but has shed most of its mass during the later stages of its evolution. Binary stars provide the only direct way to measure the mass of stars, from observations of their orbital motions. Thus, observations of binary stars where the two components are at such different stages of stellar evolution can be used to determine the relationship between the mass of stars and how they evolve. Stars with masses of around ten times that of the Sun or higher have powerful stellar winds. The Sun loses about 10−14 solar masses per year in its solar wind, which travels at up to around 750 km/s, but the massive stars can lose as much as a billion times more material each year in winds travelling at several thousand kilometres per second. These stars exist for a few million years, and during this time the stellar wind carries away a significant fraction of their mass, and plays a crucial role in determining whether they explode as supernovae or not. This stellar mass loss was first discovered using rocket-borne telescopes in the 1960s, but the IUE allowed astronomers to observe a very large number of stars, allowing the first proper studies of how stellar mass loss is related to mass and luminosity. ===SN 1987A=== In 1987, a star in the Large Magellanic Cloud exploded as a supernova. Designated SN 1987A, this event was of enormous importance to astronomy, as it was the closest known supernova to Earth, and the first visible to the naked eye, since Kepler's star in 1604 – before the invention of the telescope. The opportunity to study a supernova so much more closely than had ever been possible before triggered intense observing campaigns at all major astronomical facilities, and the first IUE observations were made about 14 hours after the discovery of the supernova. IUE data were used to determine that the progenitor star had been a blue supergiant, where theory had strongly expected a red supergiant. Hubble Space Telescope images revealed a nebula surrounding the progenitor star which consisted of mass lost by the star long before it exploded; IUE studies of this material showed that it was rich in nitrogen, which is formed in the CNO cycle – a chain of nuclear reactions which produces most of the energy emitted by stars much more massive than the Sun. Astronomers inferred that the star had been a red supergiant, and had shed a large amount of matter into space, before evolving into a blue supergiant and exploding. ===The Interstellar Medium=== The IUE was used extensively to investigate the interstellar medium. The ISM is normally observed by looking at background sources such as hot stars or quasars; interstellar material absorbs some of the light from the background source and so its composition and velocity can be studied. One of IUE's early discoveries was that the Milky Way is surrounded by a vast halo of hot gas, known as a galactic corona. The hot gas, heated by cosmic rays and supernovae, extends several thousand light years above and below the plane of the Milky Way. IUE data was also crucial in determining how the light from distant sources is affected by dust along the line of sight. Almost all astronomical observations are affected by this interstellar extinction, and correcting for it is the first step in most analyses of astronomical spectra and images. IUE data was used to show that within the galaxy, interstellar extinction can be well described by a few simple equations. The relative variation of extinction with wavelength shows little variation with direction; only the absolute amount of absorption changes. Interstellar absorption in other galaxies can similarly be described by fairly simple 'laws'.Howarth LMC ===Active Galactic Nuclei=== The IUE vastly increased astronomers' understanding of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Before its launch, 3C 273, the first known quasar, was the only AGN that had ever been observed at UV wavelengths. With IUE, UV spectra of AGN became widely available. One particular target was NGC 4151, the brightest Seyfert galaxy. Starting soon after IUE's launch, a group of European astronomers pooled their observing time to repeatedly observe the galaxy, to measure variations over time of its UV emission. They found that the UV variation was much greater than that seen at optical and infrared wavelengths. IUE observations were used to study the black hole at the centre of the galaxy, with its mass being estimated at between 50 and 100 million times that of the Sun. The UV emission varied on timescales of a few days, implying that the region of emission was only a few light days across. Quasar observations were used to probe intergalactic space. Clouds of hydrogen gas in between the Earth and a given quasar will absorb some of its emission at the wavelength of Lyman alpha. Because the clouds and the quasar are all at different distances from Earth, and moving at different velocities due to the expansion of the universe, the quasar spectrum has a \\"forest\\" of absorption features at wavelengths shorter than its own Lyman alpha emission. Before IUE, observations of this so-called Lyman-alpha forest were limited to very distant quasars, for which the redshift caused by the expansion of the universe brought it into optical wavelengths. IUE allowed nearer quasars to be studied, and astronomers used this data to determine that there are fewer hydrogen clouds in the nearby universe than there are in the distant universe. The implication is that over time, these clouds have formed into galaxies. ==Mission termination== The IUE was designed to have a minimum lifetime of three years, and carried consumable sufficient for a five-year mission. However, it lasted far longer than its design called for. Occasional hardware failures caused difficulties, but innovative techniques were devised to overcome them. For example, the spacecraft was equipped with six gyros to stabilise the spacecraft. Successive failures of these in 1979, 1982, 1983, 1985 and 1996 ultimately left the spacecraft with a single functional gyro. Telescope control was maintained with two gyros by using the telescope's Sun sensor to determine the spacecraft's attitude, and stabilisation in three axes proved possible even after the fifth failure, by using the Sun sensor, the Fine Error Sensors and the single remaining gyro. Most other parts of the telescope systems remained fully functional throughout the mission.INES Project Documentation . Sdc.laeff.inta.es (2001-07-06). Retrieved on 2011-08-07. In 1995, budget concerns at NASA almost led to the termination of the mission, but instead the operations responsibilities were redivided, with ESA taking control for 16 hours a day, and GSFC for the remaining 8 only. The ESA 16 hours was used for science operations, while the GSFC 8 hours was used only for maintenance. In February 1996, further budget cuts led ESA to decide that it would no longer maintain the satellite. Operations ceased in September of that year, and on 30 September all the remaining hydrazine was discharged, the batteries were drained and switched off, and at 1844 UT, the radio transmitter was shut down and all contact with the spacecraft was lost. It continues to orbit the Earth in its geosynchronous orbit, and will continue to do so more or less indefinitely as it is far above the upper reaches of the Earth's atmosphere. Anomalies in the Earth's gravity due to its non-spherical shape meant that the telescope tended to drift west from its original location at approximately 70°W longitude towards approximately 110°W. During the mission, this drift was corrected by occasional rocket firings, but since the end of the mission the satellite has drifted uncontrolled to the west of its former location.Live Real Time Satellite Tracking And Predictions: Iue.

Sullivan, R. C. Bohlin, S. Heap, & J. Mead, pp. 57 – 65 As the mission entered its second decade, plans were made for its final archive. Throughout the mission, calibration techniques were improved, and the final software for data reduction yielded significant improvements over earlier calibrations. Eventually, the entire set of available raw data was recalibrated using the final version of the data reduction software, creating a uniform high quality archive. Today, the archive is hosted at the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes at Space Telescope Science Institute and is available via the World Wide Web and APIs.Mast Iue. Archive.stsci.edu.

The IUE mission, by virtue of its very long duration and the fact that for most of its lifetime it provided astronomers' only access to UV light, had a major impact on astronomy. By the end of its mission it was considered by far the most successful and productive space observatory mission. For many years after the end of the mission, its archive was the most heavily used dataset in astronomy, and IUE data has been used in over 250 PhD projects worldwide. Almost 4,000 peer-reviewed papers have now been published based on IUE data, including some of the most cited astronomy papers of all time. The most cited paper based on IUE data is one analysing the nature of interstellar reddening, which has subsequently been cited over 5,500 times. The Hubble Space Telescope has now been in orbit for 21 years (as of 2011) and Hubble data has been used in almost 10,000 peer-reviewed publications at that time.HST Publication Statistics.

In 2009, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph was installed on HST by astronauts launched with the instrument by the Space Shuttle, and this device records ultraviolet spectra, thus proving some ultraviolet observation ability in this period.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1920 to 1932, as a member of the Conservative Party. Spinks was born in Blackstock, Ontario, the son of William Spinks and Sussannah Hooey, and was educated at public schools in the Township of Cartwright. His family came west in 1894 and settled near Treherne, Manitoba. He worked as a farmer, and was the reeve of the Rural Municipality of South Norfolk in Manitoba for thirteen years. Spinks was a member of the Grain Growers' Association, was president of the Agricultural Society for eight years, and was a freemason and Orangeman. In 1902, he married Mary Eleanor Jackson. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1920 provincial election, defeating Liberal incumbent Andrew W. Myles by 180 votes in the rural constituency of Cypress. Spinks was one of only eight conservatives elected to the fifty-five member legislature in this cycle. He was again successful in the 1922 election, defeating John Young of the United Farmers of Manitoba by 47 votes as the Conservatives fell to seven seats across the province. The Conservative Party recovered to fifteen seats in the 1927 election, as Spinks defeated Progressive candidate Andrew Moore by 144 votes. Five years later, in the 1932 election, he lost to Liberal-Progressive James Christie by 256 votes. He campaigned for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1935 federal election as a candidate of the Conservative Party of Canada, but lost to Liberal-Progressive candidate William Gilbert Weir. Spinks had retired from active farm work by this time. In 1937, he moved to Hamilton, Ontario. Spinks died in 1949 while visiting Toronto, Ontario.

He is thought to have reigned roughly 732 BCE to 725 BCE, or seven years. Tefnakht I first began his career as the \\"Great Chief of the West\\" and Prince of Sais and was a late contemporary of the last ruler of the 22nd Dynasty: Shoshenq V. Tefnakht I was actually the second ruler of Sais; he was preceded by Osorkon C, who is attested by several documents mentioning him as this city's Chief of the Ma and Army Leader, according to Kenneth Kitchen,KA Kitchen, The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100–650 BC), 3rd ed. 1996, Aris & Phillips Limited, pp.351 & p.355 while his predecessor as Great Chief of the West was a man named Ankhhor.Kitchen, op. cit., § 316. A recently discovered statue, dedicated by Tefnakht I to Amun-Re, reveals important details about his personal origins.P.R. Del Francia, \\"Di una statuette dedicate ad Amon-Ra dal grande capo dei Ma Tefnakht nel Museo Egizio di Firenze\\", S. Russo (ed.) Atti del V Convegno Nazionale di Egittologia e Papirologia, Firenze, 10-12 dicembre 1999, Firenze, 2000, 63-112, 76-82 The statue's text states that Tefnakht was the son of a certain Gemnefsutkapu and the grandson of Basa, a priest of Amun near Sais. Consequently, Tefnakht was not actually descended from either lines of Chiefs of the Ma and of the Libu as traditionally believed but rather came from a family of priests, and his ancestors being more likely Egyptians rather than Libyans.Del Francia, pp.63-112 & 76-82 Tefnakht is absent from the Manethonian tradition, perhaps because of the abbreviated form in which the Aegyptiaca came to us, perhaps because Tefnakht was considered a usurper. == Biography == Tefnakht erected two donation stelas in Years 36 and 38 of Shoshenq V as a Prince at Saïs. His Year 38 stela from Buto is significant not only because Tefnakht employs the rather boastful epithet of \\"Great Chief of the entire land\\" but due to its list of his religious titles as prophet of Neith, Edjo and the Lady of Imay.Kitchen, The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt, p.362 This reflects his control over Sais, Buto to the north and Kom el-Hish to the southwest even prior to the end of the 22nd Dynasty—with the death of Shoshenq V—and reflects Tefnakht's political base in the Western Delta region of Egypt. The 22nd Dynasty was politically fragmenting even prior to the death of Shoshenq V. Tefnakht established his capital at Sais, and formed an alliance with other minor kings of the Delta region in order to conquer Middle and Upper Egypt, which was under the sway of the Nubian king Piye. He was able to capture and unify many of the cities of the Delta region, thus making Tefnakht considerably more powerful than any of his predecessors in either the 22nd or 23rd dynasties. Tefnakht was not a member of the Tanite- based 22nd Dynasty of Egypt since Tanis is located in the Eastern Delta whereas his local city of Sais was situated in the Western Delta closer to Libya. His modest title 'Great chief of the West' also hints at a non-royal background. Prior to assuming the title of \\"Great Chief of the West\\", Tefnakht managed to extend his control southward, capturing the city of Memphis and besieging the city of Herakleopolis, which was an ally of the Kushite king Piye of Nubia. This caused him to face considerable opposition from Piye, especially after Nimlot, the local ruler of Hermopolis defected from Piye's sphere of influence, to his side. A pair of naval engagements soon checked any further advances by Tefnakht's coalition into Piye's Middle Egyptian territories, and Memphis was soon recaptured by Piye. After further campaigns, Tefnakht's allies surrendered to Piye and Tefnakht soon found himself isolated. He finally dispatched a letter formally submitting his loyalty and swearing his loyalty to Piye. Tefnakht, however, was the only Lower Egyptian prince to avoid seeing Piye face to face. These details are recounted in the Great Victory stela of Piye which this Nubian ruler erected on the New Year's Day of his 21st regnal year. Shortly afterwards, Piye returned home to Nubia at Gebel Barkal, and never returned to Lower Egypt again. ==Kingship== 200px Despite this setback, Tefnakht was left alone as the local prince of his local region of Sais. He managed, over time, to soon reestablish his kingdom's control in the Delta region from the political vacuum which resulted after Piye's departure from this region. It is generally believed that prince Tefnakht officially proclaimed himself as king Shepsesre Tefnakht I and adopted a royal title sometime after Piye's departure from Lower Egypt. His successor at Sais was Bakenranef. While most scholars such as Kenneth Kitchen have equated Manetho's Tefnakht with the king Shepsesre Tefnakht of Sais who is attested by the Year 8 Athens donation stela, a recent article by Olivier PerduOlivier Perdu, \\"La Chefferie de Sébennytos de Piankhy à Psammétique Ier\\", Revue d'Égyptology 55 (2004), pp. 95-111. has suggested that this Tefnakht was rather Tefnakht II, a much later king of Sais who ruled in the mid-680's BCE during the late Nubian 25th Dynasty. In his paper, Perdu published a newly discovered stela dating from the second year of Necho I's reign, which he contends is similar in style, text and content to the Year 8 stela of Shepsesre Tefnakht. Perdu, thus, infers that these two kings of Sais—Necho I and Tefnakht II—were close contemporaries. However, his arguments are not currently accepted by most Egyptian scholars such as Dan'el Kahn or Kenneth Kitchen who still believe that the Year 8 Athens stela of king Shepsesre Tefnakht likely belongs to Tefnakht I rather than a hypothetical Tefnakht II who would then have assumed power in 685 BC at Sais—early during the reign of Taharqa, one of the most powerful Nubian rulers of Egypt. Kahn has also stressed at an Egyptological Conference at Leiden that Perdu's epigraphic criteria here in the famed Athens stela—such as the use of the tripartite wig, the method through which the falcon-headed god keeps his head upright in the same stela and on temple wall reliefs contemporary with Tefnakht I's time, the decoration of the stela scene: Heaven supported by wAs scepters—appear already in use in the 24th or early 25th Nubian dynasty during Piye, Shabaka or Bakenranef's reign.Dan'el Kahn, The Transition from Libyan to Nubian Rule in \\"Egypt: Revisiting the Reign of Tefnakht, THE LIBYAN PERIOD IN EGYPT, Historical and Cultural Studies into the 21st - 24th Dynasties: Proceedings of a Conference at Leiden University 25–27 October 2007,\\" G.P.F. Broekman, R.J. Demarée & O.E. Kaper, (eds.), pp.139-48 The invisible back side of the tripartite wig can be found on the donation stela of Shebitku from Pharbaitos and on the Bakenranef/Bocchoris vase dating to the last days of Piye and the beginning of Shabaka—all appear close in time to the presumed reign of Tefnakht I. Moreover, the head of the falcon-headed god Horus is, as Perdu himself noted, similar in style to the stela of Tefnakht, chief of the Meshwesh and Piye's chief rival.Olivier Perdu, De Stéphinates à Nécho ou les débuts de la XXVIe Dynastie, académie des Inscriptios & belles-lettres – Comptes rendus (CRAIBL), 2002. p.1229, n. 73 Unlike Necho I, neither of this king's presumed Saite royal predecessors, a certain Nekauba and Tefnakht II, are monumentally attested in Lower Egypt. Hence, the latter two kings who appear in the records of Manetho's Epitome may well be fictitious. Moreover, it is improbable that Taharqa, perhaps one of the most powerful Kushite kings of the Nubian 25th dynasty for the first 18 years of his reign, would have tolerated the existence of a rival line of native Egyptian kings at Sais during the first half of his reign when he exercised full control over Memphis and the Delta region. After all, the 24th dynasty Saite rulers Tefnakht and Bakenranef had fought Taharqa's father Piye and resisted Shabaka's expansion of Kushite power into the Delta region. ==References== ==Further reading== * Dan'el Kahn, Did Tefnakht I rule as king?, GM 173 (1999), pp. 123–125 * Dan'el Kahn, The Transition from Libyan to Nubian Rule in Egypt: Revisiting the Reign of Tefnakht.

His parents, James Buchanan Roden and Hattie Roden, had five other children. Little is known of Roden's early life but he grew up on a farm in Bearden and attended high school there before going to a teacher's college and then practising as a teacher for a brief period. Thereafter, he spent some time working on oil fields, first in Oklahoma and later in Odessa, Texas. Roden married Lois I. Scott on February 12, 1937. With her he had two daughters and four sons, including George Roden. == Early religious adherence == Details of Roden's early religious views are as sketchy as those of his secular life. However, an obituary says that he joined \\"the Christian Church\\" in the same year that he married, although his journey to that church and the extent to which it involved change is uncertain. Kenneth Newport, a professor of Christian Thought, notes that \\"like many other converted Jews ... he carried with him into Christianity a good deal of his Jewishness\\", giving as an example of this the importance that Roden later attached to the Jewish festivals of Purim and Passover. By 1940, the Rodens were members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church (SDA) in Kilgore, Texas. It is possible that the appeal of the SDA lay at least in part in its similarities to some aspects of Judaism, such as practising the sabbath on the seventh day and abiding by the dietary laws of the Old Testament, but in addition the couple had been given Bible Readings for the Home Circle as a wedding present by Lois's mother. That book was a publication of the SDA and it is probable, although not certain, that somewhere in Lois's family there was already an involvement with that church. The Rodens later moved from the church at Kilgore to that at Odessa, where Ben became a head elder. Somewhere around this time, in the early- to mid-1940s, the couple became influenced by the Shepherd's Rod movement, which had splintered from the SDA, and probably visited its base at the Mount Carmel Center, near Waco, Texas, even if only briefly. They were disfellowshiped from their SDA church, which caused them offence because they had helped to finance the church building and felt that they therefore had a right to use it. Various accounts exist of a stand-off between Lois and the church, with her occupying it for several days and receiving supplies from Ben and their son, George. == Shepherd's Rod == Ben and Lois Roden continued their involvement with the Shepherd's Rod, although there is again a scarcity of reliable information. They visited Mt Carmel for several months in 1953 and were there again in 1955 at the time when Victor Houteff, the leader of The Rod, died. It seems that he sought to become Houteff's successor as leader but that role went to Florence, the widow of Victor. == The Branch == At the time of Houteff's death, Roden believed The Rod teaching that truth must be continually progressive and God's people were to march onward with it. Later that year, he said that he was told to give a message to Florence Houteff and the Executive Council of The Rod but was hesitant to do so. Roden stated that, because of his reluctance, one night while he was in bed, the Lord picked him up by the pajama tops and told him to write a letter as he had been made to do. He said that after he had written the letter, he told the Lord, These are not my words, I cannot sign this. He said that the Lord then told him to sign it \\"The Branch.\\" Roden stated that he was later shown from the Bible and Church writings that this name was Jesus’ new name. Roden taught that the change of Christ’s name was reflective of the change of His work as represented in the prophecies which reveal His new name. Thereafter he worked to share with others what he believed God had revealed to him. Roden also taught that the name \\"The Branch\\" was to be the new name of his Church. Thus the Branch Davidian Seventh-day Adventist Association was organized. He taught that eventually the names \\"Davidian\\" and \\"Seventh day Adventists\\" would be dropped, leaving the name of the Church, \\"The Branch.\\" === Doctrines === One of the doctrines of the Seventh-day Adventists is that on October 22, 1844, God, the Father, and Jesus moved from the throne from which they ruled the universe to the judgment throne in the Most Holy Place of the heavenly Sanctuary in order to fulfill the antitypical Day of Atonement wherein they were to go through the books of records in order to judge the people's deeds to determine their rewards or punishments. They teach that this investigative work was to begin with those who were already dead in order to decide who was to come up in the resurrection of the saints, and those who were to later come up in the resurrection of the wicked. They also teach that eventually the judgment would pass on to those who were living in order to determine who would be translated without seeing death at Christ's second coming, and those would be destroyed by the brightness of His coming. Roden told the Seventh-day Adventist Church and The Rod that the judgment has passed from the dead to the living on 20 October 1955. Roden assumed control of the group, and renamed it the General Association of Davidian Seventh-day Adventists. He proclaimed himself to be King David's successor. == Death == Roden died in October 1978, after which Lois led the sect until the emergence of David Koresh in the mid-1980s. == References == == External links == * Benjamin Roden's literature and studies * Category:Founders of new religious movements Category:1902 births Category:1978 deaths Category:Branch Davidians Category:People disfellowshipped by the Seventh-day Adventist Church Category:People from Okfuskee County, Oklahoma Category:Converts from Judaism ","title":"Benjamin Roden"},{"id":"2235328","text":"is a style of karate which was founded by Takayuki Kubota.

The progressive ranks of karate are reflected in the different colored belts. There are two major classifications: the ranks of black belt are called dans, while all those below the rank of black belt are kyus. In Gosoku-ryū, there are ten kyu ratings, as follows: { cellspacing=\\"0\\" -  align=centerLowest - 10th Kyu  style=\\"width:75%; background:White; border:1px solid gray;\\" colspan=\\"21\\"  White -  - 9th Kyu  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\" colspan=\\"21\\"  Yellow Belt -  - 8th Kyu  style=\\"background:Orange;\\" colspan=\\"21\\"  Orange Belt -  - 7th Kyu  style=\\"background:Blue;\\" colspan=\\"21\\"  Blue Belt -  - 6th Kyu  style=\\"background:Purple;\\" colspan=\\"21\\"  Purple Belt -  - 5th Kyu  style=\\"background:Green;\\" colspan=\\"21\\"  Green Belt -  - 4th Kyu  style=\\"background:Green;\\" colspan=\\"21\\"  Green Belt -  - 3rd Kyu  style=\\"background: SaddleBrown;\\" colspan=\\"21\\"  Brown Belt -  - 2nd Kyu  style=\\"background: SaddleBrown;\\" colspan=\\"21\\"  Brown Belt -  - 1st Kyu  style=\\"background: SaddleBrown;\\" colspan=\\"21\\"  Brown Belt -  align=centerHighest } After achieving shodan, or first degree black belt ranking, a karateka may progress further though the dan ranks up to ju-dan, or tenth degree black belt. { cellspacing=\\"0\\" -  align=centerLowest - 1st Dan  style=\\"background:Black;\\" colspan=\\"19\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  Black Belt 1st Dan -  - 2nd Dan  style=\\"background:Black;\\" colspan=\\"17\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  Black Belt 2nd Dan -  - 3rd Dan  style=\\"background:Black;\\" colspan=\\"15\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  Black Belt 3rd Dan -  - 4th Dan  style=\\"background:Black;\\" colspan=\\"13\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  Black Belt 4th Dan -  - 5th Dan  style=\\"background:Black;\\" colspan=\\"11\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  Black Belt 5th Dan -  - 6th Dan  style=\\"background:Black;\\" colspan=\\"9\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  Black Belt 6th Dan -  - 7th Dan  style=\\"background:Black;\\" colspan=\\"7\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  Black Belt 7th Dan -  - 8th Dan  style=\\"background:Black;\\" colspan=\\"5\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  Black Belt 8th Dan -  - 9th Dan  style=\\"background:Black;\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  style=\\"background:Yellow;\\"  style=\\"background:Black;\\"  Black Belt 9th Dan -  - 10th Dan  style=\\"background:Black;

Instructors that are 4th dan are sometimes awarded the title of \\"Shihan-Dai\\" (deputy master). Instructors that are 5th dan or higher are sometimes awarded the title of \\"Shihan\\" (master instructor). Title is not always awarded by rank alone. One must be an active instructor and be awarded the rank by Kubota. All Black Belt ranks are registered directly with the International Association Headquarters in Glendale, California. ==Major differences from other styles== Gosoku-ryū is similar to Shotokan karate. It differs from Shotokan in that it incorporates the linear power movements of Shotokan with the speed and soft circular motions of Gōjū-ryū. The meaning of Gosoku-Ryu is \\"Hard and fast\\". Emphasis is put on practical application and sparring. Stances are generally shorter when in defensive positions and transition to longer stances when power moves are delivered. During kicks, including kihon, hands are kept in guard (and not spread aside). Gosoku-ryū teaches quick leg sweeps and take- downs; in kumite, attacks often end on the floor. Fast footwork which adds speed and power by utilizing the rotation of the hip makes Gosoku-ryū different from other styles. Gosoku-ryū also incorporates aikido, judo, and jujitsu techniques, which are used in ground fighting and for control and restraint techniques that are taught to law enforcement. ==Kobudo weapons== Many weapons are practiced in the dojo: Kubotan, Tonfa, Kama, Jō, Bokuto, Bokken, Shinai, Tsue (walking cane), and the Katana (Japanese sword).Warsaw Karate Center (in English) Kubota trained with Taira Shinken learning ancient Kobudo katas while developing his own for his school. The Kobudo kata created by him include: * Tonfa: Washi no kata, Juji no uke. * Jō: Keibo jitsu, Ken shin ryū. * Tsue (walking cane): Tsue ichi no kata, ni no kata, san no kata, yon no kata, go no kata, roku no kata, Mawashi no kata. * Katana (created by Kubota): Sankaku giri, Atemi no kata, Kubo giri, Gyaku giri, Iaido ichi no kata, ni no kata, san no kata, Toshin. * Bokken: Ken no Michi, Ken no Mai ==Prominent students == Takemasa Okuyama and Temoanarupe Inuhaere Hanshi Master .

He was the first native of Northumbria to occupy the bishopric of Lindisfarne. ==Life== Eata was originally taken to Lindisfarne as a boy under Aidan and trained as a monk. He was chosen as one of the 12 monks selected from Lindisfarne to found the new daughter monastery at Melrose.Macpherson, Ewan. \\"St. Eata.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 12 May 2013 In 651 he was elected abbot of Melrose. Around 658 he left Melrose and founded a new monastery at Ripon in Yorkshire, taking with him the young St Cuthbert, who was his guest-master. In 661 King Alchfrith of Deira expelled Eata from Ripon, because he had appointed Wilfrid as the new abbot.Walsh A New Dictionary of Saints p. 166Stephanus Vita Wilfridi 8 Eata returned to Melrose. The historian Bede described Eata as a gentle and greatly revered man. As an administrator Eata applied his skills at the time of plague, civil disorders and major ecclesiastical change.St. Eata's, Atcham, Shrewsbury In 663 Alhfrith and Wilfrid persuaded King Oswiu to hold the Synod of Whitby to decide whether the local Church, English and Irish, would come into line with the traditions of the universal Church and would practice the Roman [aka Western] Rite of that Church, or would continue to diverge from it where it clashed with Irish traditions as practised in Northumbria. Thus it would decide whether Roman traditions, would take priority in Northumbria over matters such as the clerical tonsure and the date of Easter; the synod decided to accept the arguments of Wilfrid and the king for the universal Church traditions using the Roman Rite, to which Eata, unlike Colmán of Lindisfarne, acquiesced.Bede Ecclesiastical History of England Chapter 25 Before Whitby, the abbot of Lindisfarne was also the Bishop of Lindisfarne, after Whitby these two roles were divided. The old abbot, Colman, left Lindisfarne to go back to Iona with 30 English monks. Tuda was selected as the next Bishop of Lindisfarne and Eata moved from Melrose to become abbot of Lindisfarne. He appointed Cuthbert as prior at Lindisfarne.Bede Ecclesiastical History of England Chapter 26 In 678, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Theodore split the diocese of Northumbria into two new bishoprics. Eata became bishop of Bernicia. Bernicia had two episcopal sees, one at Hexham and the other at Lindisfarne. Eata was the bishop of the whole of Bernicia for three years, after which the see of Hexham was assigned to Trumbert, and Lindisfarne to Eata. After the death of Trumbert in 684, Cuthbert was elected Bishop of Hexham, but was reluctant to leave his hermitage on Inner Farne. Following his consecration at York on Easter 685, Cuthbert went to see Eata, who was at Melrose. Eata and Cuthbert exchanged sees shortly thereafter, and for the last year of his life Eata occupied Hexham.Odden, Per Einer. \\"Den hellige Eata av Hexham (d. 686)\\", Den katolske kirke, February 1, 2000 Eata died of dysentery at Hexham in 686, and was buried in the Benedictine Abbey of Hexham.

The test is passed only when the Go condition is met and also the No go condition fails. The test gives no information as to the degree of conformance to, or deviation from the boundary conditions. These tests can be used for statistical process control purposes. There are specific SPC tools that use parameter based measurements (e.g., P-charts) for determining the stability of a process. == Uses  Engineering === In engineering the test is traditionally used only to check noncritical parameters where the manufacturing process is believed to be stable and well controlled, and the tolerances are wide compared to the distribution of the parameter. For example, the preceding checks before a Space Shuttle liftoff had the flight controller perform a go/no go check on each of the vehicle's critical systems. === Psychology === In psychology Go/No-go tests are used to measure a participants capacity for sustained attention and response control. For example, a go/no-go test that requires a participant to perform an action given certain stimuli (e.g., press a button – Go) and inhibit that action under a different set of stimuli (e.g., not press that same button – No-Go). === Military === In the United States Army, drills and proficiency evaluation rubrics are based on a GO/NO GO (pass/fail) system. Evaluations involving numerical scores (such as the Physical Fitness Test) convert raw scores to GO/NO GO based on cutoffs defined by the particular performance standard for that area. Within a given skills unit, the rubric often specifies GO/NO GO scoring for each individual item or concept a soldier is expected to be trained and evaluated on. Usually, a soldier must score GO (i.e. perform satisfactorily) on all sections of an evaluation in order to advance to the next phase of training, to pass the course, and/or to attain the particular qualification. == Go/no go gauges == Go/no go gauges are encountered in all types of manufacturing. They may measure a physical dimension, e.g. (50 ±0.01mm), or a value such as the value of a resistor (100Ω (ohms) ±1%). A typical example is a plug gauge. ==See also== *Gauge block *Qualitative property *Shock detector *Litmus test (politics) ==References== ==External links== * Go Or No Go?

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1927 to 1932, as a member of the Progressive Party. He was born in Hallson, North Dakota, in the United States of America, to parents of Icelandic origin. He came to Canada in 1901, and was educated at the Manitoba Agricultural College. He served as manager of several local cooperatives, including the North Star Co-operative Creamery and Arborg Farmers Co-operative Association Ltd. In 1913, Ingaldson married Violet Palson. From 1917 to 1926, he served as secretary-treasurer of the Rural Municipality of Bifrost. He was also active in drama, and took part in several plays in the region. He first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1922 provincial election as a candidate of the United Farmers of Manitoba. He lost to Liberal Michael Rojeski in the constituency of Gimli by 260 votes. Ingaldson ran again in the 1927 election as a Progressive, and defeated Liberal candidate Einar Jonasson by 225 votes (Rojeski, now an independent, finished third). The Progressives won a majority government, and Ingaldson served as a backbench supporter of John Bracken's administration. In 1930, he visited Iceland as a representative of the Manitoba government for the nation's millennial celebrations. In 1932, the Progressive and Liberal parties formed an electoral alliance to prevent the Conservatives from forming government. Despite the provincial alliance, however, Jonasson again challenged Ingaldson in Gimli. Jonasson won the challenge by 271 votes, with both candidates proclaiming support for Bracken's government.

Franz Freiherr von Mercy (or Merci), Lord of Mandre and Collenburg (c. 1598 – 3 August 1645), was a German general in the Thirty Years' War who fought for the Habsburg side. ==Biography== Franz von Mercy who came of a noble family of Lorraine, was born at Longwy some time between 1590 and 1598. From 1606 to 1630, he was engaged in the imperial service. By the latter year he had attained high military rank, and after distinguishing himself at the first Battle of Breitenfeld (1631) he commanded a regiment of foot on the Rhine and defended Rheinfelden against the Swedes with the utmost bravery, surrendering only after enduring a five-months' siege. He now became a general officer of cavalry in the rank of general-feldwachtmeister, and in 1635, 1636 and 1637 took part in further campaigns on the Rhine and Doubs. In September 1638, the elector of Bavaria made him master-general of ordnance in the army of Bavaria, then the second largest army in Germany. In the next campaign he was practically commander-in-chief of the Bavarians, and at times also of an allied army of Imperialists and Bavarians. He was now considered one of the foremost soldiers in Europe, and was made general field marshal in 1643 when he won his great victory over the French Marshal Rantzau at the Battle of Tuttlingen (24–25 November), capturing the marshal and seven thousand men. In the following year, Mercy opposed the French armies, now under the Great Condé and the Vicomte de Turenne. He fought, and in the end lost, the desperate Battle of Freiburg, but revenged himself the next year by inflicting upon Turenne the defeat of Mergentheim (Marienthal, Herbtshausen). Later in 1645, fighting once more against Enghien and Turenne, Mercy was killed at the Battle of Nordlingen (or Allerheim) at the crisis of the engagement, which, even without Mercy's guiding hand, was almost a drawn battle. He died on 3 August 1645. On the spot where he fell, Enghien erected a memorial, with the inscription Sta viator, heroem calcas. ==Marriages and issue== Mercy was married three times. His first wife was Anna Margareta Bonn von Wachenheim who died around 1628 and made Mercy her sole heir. In 1630, Mercy married Anna Margareta von Schauenburg († 1636), a daughter of Johann Rainer von Schauenburg, the Landvogt of Ortenau. They had at least one daughter, Claudia (1631 – 1708) who later married Graf Bonaventura von Fugger (1619 – 1693), the first son of Otto Heinrich Fugger. The last wife of Franz von Mercy was Maria Magdalena von Flachsland who gave birth to most of his children, including three sons and one daughter who survived their childhood. All sons joined either the Austrian or the bavarian military. The first son Max Leopold inherited Mercys own Bavarian Regiment and later became imperial Generalfeldwachtmeister. The second son Peter Ernst von Mercy died in Austrian service deadly wounded in the Siege of Buda 1686, his son was Count Claude Florimond de Mercy, generally recognized as the last male descendant of Franz von Mercy. The third son Ferdinand Franz died in 1683 as commander of the Bavarian fortress of Ingolstadt.Pechtl, Andreas (2009): Nochmals Grimmelshausens „tapferer General“ Franz von Mercy.

At the height of her career, her readership was greater than 40 million people. ==Early life== Porter was born in Patchogue, New York, on Long Island as Sylvia Field Feldman to Louis and Rose Maisel Feldman. Originally majoring in English literature, she switched to economics and finance given the impact of the Stock Market Crash of 1929. It has been suggested that her fiancé, bank employee Reed Porter, was relying upon Sylvia to explain the complications of the worldwide financial panic.Current Biography 1941, pp679-81 They were married in 1931. She graduated magna cum laude from Hunter College in 1932, and her expertise in government bonds enabled her to get a job as assistant to the president of an investment counseling firm. Working 12-hour days, she quickly learned more about the bond market, currency fluctuations and movements of the price of gold.Id. at 680 In her spare time, she pursued an MBA at New York University.Id. ==Writing career== Starting in 1934 as S.F. Porter, she published a newsletter devoted exclusively to U.S. government bonds, and was able to persuade the New York Post to hire her to write a thrice-weekly financial column. From there, she began writing a financial column for American Banker, and published How To Make Money in Government Bonds (1939), the first book to cover all phases of government finance as well as to explain it in plain language. This was followed by If War Comes to the American Home, which relied upon simple language and interesting anecdotes to explain national defense to the average reader. In 1938, S.F. Porter became financial editor for the Post. It was not until 1942 that most of Porter's avid readers learned that their most trusted financial wizard was not a wise old man, but an attractive 29-year-old woman. The Post had concluded, correctly, that the widely respected columnist would be accepted regardless of gender. The \\"revelation\\" paved the way for Sylvia Porter to go on the radio, and the program What Can I Do? began regular broadcast from New York's WJZ. In 1959, Porter received an honorary degree from Bates College. She continued to add to her bibliography of bestsellers about the world of finance. In February 1966 Porter advised President Lyndon B. Johnson on the appointment of Andrew Brimmer, the first African American to the serve on the Federal Reserve Board. In 1975, she published Sylvia Porter's Money Book, subtitled \\"How to Earn It, Spend It, Save It, Invest It, Borrow It and Use It to Better Your Life\\". In addition to her regular newspaper column, Porter wrote monthly articles for the Ladies Home Journal during the years 1965 to 1982.Biographical Sketch, Porter, Sylvia F. (C3977), Western Historical Manuscript Collection, Columbia, Missouri After 43 years with the Post, she hired on with the New York Daily News in 1978. From 1984 to 1987, she had 400,000 subscribers to her magazine, Sylvia Porter's Personal Finance. In the 1980s, her name was attached to a series of personal finance software packages for home computers.

He has written around 1600 songs. ==Early years== Kartner started his singing career at the age of eight, by winning a local festival. He lived with his family in Amsterdam and worked in a chocolate factory. Kartner worked as a promoter and producer at record label Dureco with Annie de Reuver, with whom he formed Duo X. He was a member of the band Corry & de Rekels, which sold over one million records in the 1960s. He created his well-known alter ego, Father Abraham, after writing a Dutch carnival song, \\"Father Abraham had seven sons\\". Initially he wore a fake beard, but subsequently grew a real beard which, along with a bowler hat, became his trademark. In 1971 his duet with Wilma Landkroon, \\"Zou het erg zijn, lieve opa\\" (Would it be bad, dear grandfather?), reached Number one in the Dutch pop music charts. ==The Little Café by the Harbour== In 1975, Kartner scored his second biggest hit, \\"Het kleine café aan de haven\\" (The little café by the harbour). This song has since been covered over 250 times in various languages. English cover versions include \\"The Little Cafe by the Harbour\\" by Engelbert Humperdinck, \\"My Favourite Cafe on the Harbour\\" by Audrey Landers and \\"The Red Rose Café\\" by Demis Roussos and also The Fureys. In French the song was recorded as \\"Le café de la Rue d'Amérique\\" by Mireille Mathieu and \\"Le café des trois Colombes\\" by Joe Dassin, and in German as \\"Die kleine Kneipe\\" by Peter Alexander. ==The Smurfs== In May 1977, Kartner was asked to make a promotional song about The Smurfs. The record company initially only pressed 1,000 copies of the single, called \\"The Smurf Song\\", since they were unsure about the single's potential. However, they were all sold within one day at a Schlager festivalhttps://standbyproductions.nl/zangers/vader%20abraham.htm Biography from booking agency (in Dutch). After a repress, 400,000 singles were quickly sold. A full Smurfs album was then created, which sold 500,000 copies\\"50 Jaar Nummer 1-Hits 1956-2006\\", Johan van Slooten, Becht Publishing, 2006. The album was released in several dozen countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, and Sweden, and in various different languages. The album scored a number one hit in 16 countries. Subsequently, Kartner released other Smurf-themed albums, again in various countries and languages, such as Ga je mee naar Smurfenland (Dutch) and Vater Abraham im Land der Schlümpfe (German). In all, Kartner's Smurf works have sold around 17 million copieshttps://www.ad.nl/show/vader-abraham-zei-eigenlijk-nee-tegen- smurfenlied~ae593920/ Dutch newspaper AD, 23th october 2018. ==Political songs== As a reaction to the 1973 oil crisis, Kartner and the right-wing politician Hendrik Koekoek recorded the duet \\"Den Uyl is in den olie\\" (den Uyl is in the oil), which blamed the Social Democratic prime minister Joop den Uyl and Arabs for the crisis. In the carnival season of 1975, he published \\"Wat doen we met die Arabieren hier\\" (What do we do with the Arabs here?), part of which translates as \\"What shall we do with the Arabs here?/They can't be trusted with our pretty women here.“ The record company has subsequently deleted the song. His 1976 song, \\"Het leger der werklozen\\" (The army of unemployed) portrays the jobless as people who spend the day sitting in pubs, drinking alcohol. In 2002 he recorded \\"Wimmetje gaat, Pimmetje komt\\" (Wim goes, Pim comes) with the populist politician Pim Fortuyn. ==Later career== In 1981 Kartner recorded a song about Weepuls, \\"Wij zijn de wuppies\\" (We are the Weepuls). He wrote the music for the opening and closing credits on the Japanese cartoon adaption of the 1990 TV series Moomin and \\"Ik ben verliefd (Shalalie)\\", the Dutch entry for the 2010 Eurovision Song Contest.

The son of former slaves, Hardy was born in 1894 and lived a religious and farming life until he signed up to serve overseas in World War I in July 1918. He served in the segregated 805th infantry, which was assigned a variety of manual labor and support tasks. Hardy himself served as a scout, supplying the front line troops when necessary. Though Hardy did experience combat, he was never seriously injured and rarely discussed his experiences concerning the fighting. Instead, he preferred to recount stories about the food, the bravery of the soldiers and the weather in France. After the war, he took on a variety of jobs including school bus driver, farmer, deacon and cosmetics salesman, the latter of which he performed well past his 100th birthday. He received the Victory Medal, a special medal from the Mississippi National Guard and the French Légion d'honneur. In 1999, the Mississippi Legislature adopted a resolution recognizing him as an outstanding citizen of Mississippi. At the time of his death, at the age of 112, he was recognized as the oldest combat veteran ever, the oldest male ever recorded in Mississippi and the second-oldest man and World War I veteran in the world. ==Early life== Hardy was born in Aberdeen, Mississippi in 1894. Although he claimed to have been born in 1893, census records show he was born in 1894. Hardy's parents, Morris Hardy--born in the 1840s--and Nancy Hardy, were former slaves who after the Civil War had purchased of land in Mississippi from a Chickasaw Native American for a dollar. The Hardy family was a deeply religious one, and Moses would later recount that Exodus 20:12, which instructed one to honor their parents,\\"Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.\\" was his favorite Bible passage and one which he lived by. Hardy was married once, to a woman by the name of Fannie Marshall, with whom he would end up having eight children. ==Military career== Hardy's service in France lasted from July 1918 to July 1919, and included thirty-nine combat days. As an African American, he served in a segregated army unit, the 805th Pioneer Infantry, which was commanded by white officers. Although the unit's purpose was to provide support for engineer regiments, it was also an infantry unit that was equipped to fight if necessary. The unit focused mainly of the tasks of stevedores, such as unloading cargo from ships, but also performed other manual labor tasks, such as cooking and organizing burials. Hardy's outfit was armed solely with rifles, instead of standard-issue machine guns. After the war, Hardy's division was responsible for cleaning up the battlefields and removing the dead. Hardy himself admitted to his family that he was \\"scared to death\\" when he first arrived overseas, but believed that the soldiers were fed something to make them brave, which he referred to as \\"brave pills\\". After a short time in the military, he claimed that he was not afraid of anything that he experienced from then on. Even in the heat of battle, Hardy professed that he would get \\"wound up\\" at times, but never frightened. He recalled many strange experiences with food and drink, such as getting used to drinking green water from canteens and eating hardtacks, which he found to be surprisingly filling. To go with this, there was often little more than small tins of ham or chicken and occasionally coffee to drink and pudding or pie for dessert. Hardy also witnessed many of his friends get killed in action, and relied on his faith in God to get him through the toughest times. Hardy often acted as a scout who would help bring supplies to troops on the front line. On September 25, 1918, he was present at the Meuse River during a mustard gas attack and, at some point during the war, he received an injury to his knee. Hardy rarely spoke about the fighting itself, and preferred to talk about France's weather when asked about his experiences overseas. ==Post-World War I== Throughout the years, he received the Victory Medal, the Occupational Medal from the Mississippi Army National Guard, an honourable discharge (which he had not received upon leaving the army) and the French Légion d'honneur. In 1999, when he was 105 years old, the Mississippi Legislature adopted a resolution recognizing him as an outstanding citizen of Mississippi. At the time, he was known as the oldest living World War I veteran, as Emiliano Mercado del Toro had not yet been discovered. He was interviewed by Treehouse Productions in 2006 as part of their Living History Project, a radio tribute to the last surviving World War I veterans that was hosted by Walter Cronkite. Though he could not speak coherently, his son Haywood Hardy, himself 80 years old at the time, recalled some of the stories that his father had told him. Hardy did not serve in World War II and instead drove a school bus, farmed and sold linaments and wigs for \\"Lucky Heart\\" cosmetics until his retirement. He reportedly continued to go door-to-door for several years past his centenary, even resorting to phone sales when his children hid the keys of his 1972 Chevrolet Caprice. The youngest of his eight children, Jean Dukes, was born in the late 1940s. He also served as a deacon and superintendent of a Sunday School class at Mount Olive Church for over 75 years. His son claimed that, until about four years before he died, his father was healthy enough to drive his car into town every day. Hardy's longevity was also credited to a daily meal that consisted of cabbage, corn bread, butter milk, potatoes and Dr Pepper, and the fact that he never drank alcohol or smoked in his life. Until a few years before his death, it was claimed that Hardy had never had a seriously ill day in his life and that he never took medicine, as it only made him sick. Hardy lived on his own until 2004 when his legs weakened and he found it almost impossible to walk. He was placed in a rest home, but was still able to feed himself and pass the days watching The Oprah Winfrey Show and The Price Is Right. At the time of his death, he was the oldest United States combat veteran ever, the oldest male ever recorded in Mississippi and had outlived at least three of his eight children. It was reported that he had several dozen grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He was also ranked as the sixth-oldest living verified person in the world, the second-oldest man and World War I veteran behind only del Toro and the last African American one. Although he suffered from mild dementia in his later years and had trouble speaking coherently, he was reported to have been completely lucid through his final days and his death was attributed to natural causes. ==See also== *List of the verified oldest people *Longevity *Supercentenarian ==References== ==External links== *The 805th Infantry Regimental history, p. 121 Category:1894 births Category:2006 deaths Category:African-American Christians Category:African-American military personnel Category:American military personnel of World War I Category:American supercentenarians Category:African- American centenarians Category:American centenarians Category:Male supercentenarians Category:Recipients of the Legion of Honour Category:People from Aberdeen, Mississippi Category:United States Army soldiers Category:Last living survivors ","title":"Moses Hardy"},{"id":"2235486","text":"Halleck Tustenuggee (also spelled Halek Tustenuggee and Hallock Tustenuggee) (c. 1807 – ?) was a 19th-century Seminole warchief. He fought against the United States government in the Second Seminole War and for the government in the American Civil War. Tustenuggee, translated as \\"Warrior\\" or \\"Grand Chief of War\\", was a common surname for Seminole warchiefs. Halleck was born in central Florida in the Miccosuke clan. He vehemently opposed the seizure of Indian lands by whites, and even killed his own sister by cutting her throat when she talked about surrender. He fought at the Battle of Lake Okeechobee on December 25, 1837, and took control of the Seminole force from their aged warchief Arpeika (also known as \\"Sam Jones\\"). On April 22, 1839, Halleck and other Seminole leaders met with Maj. Gen. Alexander Macomb, the new military commander in Florida, and received written assurance that their people could indefinitely remain in Florida if they stayed near Lake Okeechobee. Both parties believed that the war was finally over, but attacks by other bands of Indians in south Florida continued and the ceasefire soon ended. Halleck was severely wounded by U.S. troops at a skirmish at Fort King (in present-day Ocala) in April 1840 against Capt. Gabriel J. Rains (a future Civil War Confederate General). After he recovered, Halleck Tustenuggee went on a bloody rampage in north Florida for two years, leading a series of raids and skirmishes. In January 1842, the army sent the Second Infantry Regiment in pursuit of Halleck's warband. They located the Seminoles' camp near Lake George, but the Indians escaped capture. Halleck, with a band of seventy warriors, was finally defeated by Federal troops on April 19, 1842, near the settlement of Peliklakaha Hammock (in today's Lake County, Florida), the last battle of the Second Seminole War in Florida. The chief traveled from fort to fort talking about a formal surrender, all the while collecting supplies and rations for his remaining people. Finally, Federal officer William J. Worth, wise to the trick, lured Halleck's family to Fort King with a promise of food and whiskey at a celebration. Halleck soon arrived and was captured. He was held as a prisoner of war with his people on Cedar Key. On July 14, Halleck and 66 of his followers were transported out of Florida for the West. They arrived at Fort Gibson in the Indian Territory on September 5, 1842. Halleck briefly returned to Florida in 1850 to try to negotiate with Chief Billy Bowlegs, who was still opposing resettlement. During the Civil War, Halleck Tustenuggee supported the Federal government. When Confederate troops and pro- South Indian tribes moved against pro-Union Indians, Halleck joined the band of Creek leader Opothleyahola. He led his Seminole warriors in three battles — Round Mountain, Chusto-Talasah and Chustenahlah, where they were defeated and forced to flee to Kansas in severe winter weather. Halleck and his survivors settled near Fort Row, where several died of exposure and disease. ==References== * Fort Gibson muster roll for 1842 * U.S. War Department, The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, 70 volumes in 4 series.

The title of the story is a reference to the first of the Three Laws of Robotics. ==Background== In 1941 John W. Campbell of Astounding Science Fiction began a new department, \\"Probability Zero\\", for very short stories. He hoped to publish new writers, but wanted experienced authors early on, including Isaac Asimov. To Asimov's surprise, Campbell rejected \\"Big Game\\" and \\"First Law\\" in November and December 1941. Having learned that a rejected story might sell elsewhere, he saved \\"First Law\\" until it was published by Fantastic Universe in October 1956. == Plot summary == The story is very short, only three pages in length, and takes the form of Mike Donovan's account of an incident that occurred on Titan, one of Saturn's moons. He tells of a malfunctioning robot named Emma that escaped from the base and was later encountered by Donovan while he was lost during a storm. While Donovan's life was in danger, Emma chose to protect its offspring, a small robot that it had built, instead of assisting him. This was a direct violation of the First Law of Robotics, which states that \\"a robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm\\". Apparently, maternal instincts in the robot took precedence over its programming, an example of the commonly encountered literary theme of paternalism in Asimov's work. While such direct disobedience of the First Law is not described in any other robot story by Asimov, he points out that the story is told by Donovan, who may be an unreliable narrator. Asimov admits that \\"I was being funny at the expense of my robots\\". In The Complete Robot, he also points out that this story is intended as a parody and is not to be taken seriously. ==References== Category:Robot series short stories by Isaac Asimov Category:1956 short stories Category:Works originally published in Fantastic Universe ","title":"First Law"},{"id":"2235509","text":"Ayub Kalule (born 6 January 1954) is a retired boxer from Uganda, who first came to prominence when he won the Amateur World Welterweight Title at the inaugural 1974 World Championships in Havana, Cuba. He turned professional and based himself in Denmark, and went on to win the world light-middleweight championship. He subsequently lost the title to Sugar Ray Leonard. ==Boxing career== Born in Kampala, he began his professional boxing career in 1976 when he won a four-round decision over Kurt Hombach in Copenhagen, Denmark. Kalule would be based out of Denmark for the rest of his career. He then won 29 more victories, achieving 30 wins, 0 losses. Included in those victories were defeats of Alipata Korovou for the Commonwealth Middleweight Title and a 10-round decision of former US Gold Medalist Sugar Ray Seales. On 24 October 1979, Kalule was in Akita, Japan to take on Masashi Kudo for the Lineal and WBA Junior middleweight titles. Kalule easily outboxed the champion and thus captured the coveted world championship crown. He then successfully defended the title four times before taking on the legendary Sugar Ray Leonard on 25 June 1981 in the Houston Astrodome. A virtual unknown in the United States, Kalule was considered little more than a courier waiting to deliver the belt to Leonard. The fight proved much more difficult for Leonard as Kalule repeatedly landed straight lefts and fought on an almost even ground for the first five or six rounds. Slowly Leonard started to take control and in the 9th round ended the fight and Kalule's reign as WBA Champion. Kalule fought on until the beginning of 1986 and managed to win the European Middleweight Title and defend it successfully against future world champion Sumbu Kalambay. Prior to that, he received another shot at the WBA Jr Middleweight Title held at that time by Davey Moore. Kalule put up a very good fight, but again was KO'd, this time in the 10th round. Ayub's career ended on 5 February 1986 when he lost the European Middleweight Title to Herol Graham. He finished his career with a very impressive record of 46–4 with 23 KOs. ==Professional boxing record== - align=\\"centr\\" colspan=846 Wins (23 knockouts, 23 decisions), 4 Losses (4 knockouts, 0 decisions) -  align=\\"centr\\" style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Result  align=\\"centr\\" style=\\"border- style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Record  align=\\"centr\\" style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Opponent  align=\\"centr\\" style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Type  align=\\"centr\\" style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Round  align=\\"centr\\" style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Date  align=\\"centr\\" style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Location  align=\\"centr\\" style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Notes -align=center Loss 46–4 align=left Herol Graham TKO 10 5 February 1986 align=left Sheffield City Hall, Sheffield, United Kingdom align=left - Win 46–3 align=left Sumbu Kalambay SD 12 19 December 1985 align=left Ancona, Italy align=left - Win 45–3 align=left Pierre Joly TKO 8 20 June 1985 align=left K.B.

The word 'Time' refers a person's time spent during the photo shoot. The Word \\"Prints\\" refers to a physically printed photo, usually on photo paper. The foundation of the concept of TFP being that both a photographer and a model get together and exchange their 'time', for free, and each receives the photos for their own usage. Since photos can now be delivered by means other than 'Prints,' some variant wordings of this arrangement are: Time for CD or Trade for CD (TFCD). With TFCD, the photographer provides the selection of images on a CD instead of prints. Similarly, with the ease and convenience of digital high-resolution images, the generic term TF* has evolved, where it does not necessarily refer to a tangible CD or printed image since the same accepted rules apply. There are benefits to both parties of such an arrangement. The model can build a portfolio of photographs to show to prospective clients at little or no cost, while the photographer gets a model for a particular project or their portfolio with little if any outlay of cash. == Conditions == Each photo shoot arranged is usually negotiated separately, and the terms can vary widely. The number of pictures which the photographer delivers to the model can range from a single photograph up to all shots taken.Macdonald, p.120 Speed of delivery can vary as well, from a CD burned at the end of the shoot before the model leaves up to several months. Unless such a time period has been specifically discussed and agreed prior to the shoot, finished pictures ideally should be delivered within two weeks.Macdonald, p.124 == Usage == Depending on local laws, a model or photographer might agree to limit or to 'not use' some of the pictures from a shoot. The model or photographer may agree to only use specifically agreed upon pictures (to avoid sub-standard pictures that damage the photographer's or model's reputation), or the photographer may agree to only use certain images in printed publications and not on the internet.Macdonald, p.126 Legal requirements for a model release vary from place to place and from situation to situation, as does the situation regarding copyright. For example, under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, a photographer in the United Kingdom can, subject to certain exclusions and unless specifically agreed to the contrary, use any photograph in any way he or she chooses, including selling them for profit. This does not necessarily apply in other countries. These issues should be discussed and agreed prior to the shoot, in writing if necessary.Macdonald, p.127 == Variations == Negotiated compensation for a model's time can range from a straight cash figure, possibly including an amount for travel expenses or, depending on legal requirements, an extra amount for signing a model release, to a simple number of pictures in a chosen format. It can include part-pay, part-TFP arrangementsMacdonald, p.122 or \\"Time For Clothes\\" agreements where the model is given some or all of the clothing which was procured for the shoot.Macdonald, p.125 == Testing == While sometimes people use this term to mean TFP, agencies more commonly use it in the context of sending a new model to a photographer for a short session for portfolio pictures.Williams & O'Connor, p.182 While the model ultimately pays for these pictures, the agency normally pays in advance and deducts it from the model's earnings.Williams & O'Connor, p.183 Test shoots are also used by models to build experience.Williams & O'Connor, p.174 Test was also created by photographers to try out new ideas for final images to show a client, this is with no payment from either party. == Notes == == References == * * Category:Modeling Category:Photography ","title":"Time for print"},{"id":"2235517","text":"Audism is a form of discrimination aimed at persons who are deaf and the actions that deaf persons do to assist in communication with others. Tom L. Humphries coined the term in his doctoral dissertation in 1975, but it did not start to catch on until Harlan Lane used it in his own writings. Humphries originally applied audism to individual attitudes and practices; whereas Lane broadened the term to include oppression of deaf people. ==Types of audism== Linguistic audism can occur by banning use of sign languages. Such as the 1880 Milan conference when signed language was banned in schools. Many schools throughout the world engaged in such prohibition and some continue to do so. Audism may also be found in deaf education and in other corporate institutions and groups that deal with deafness. In these cases the educators, administrators, and professionals within these organizations behave in a way that is meant to dominate or marginalize the Deaf community. Dysconscious audism favors what is normal for hearing people. This limits Deaf culture and pride, by creating an environment in which deaf people must conform to the ways of hearing people. It greatly impacts Deaf education in terms of shunning sign languages in favor of communication that is based on spoken languages, and more acceptable to hearing people.\\"Audism\\". Deaf Websites. Additionally, deaf people can practice forms of discrimination against members of their own community, based on what they believe is acceptable behavior, use of language, or social association. Dr. Genie Gertz explored examples of such audism in American society in her published dissertation.Dysconscious Audism: A Theoretical Proposal in Open Your Eyes: Deaf Studies Talking Audism can also occur between groups of deaf people, with some who choose not to use a sign language and not to identify with Deaf culture considering themselves to be superior to those who do, or members of the Deaf community asserting superiority over deaf people who use listening and spoken language to communicate. Dr. Frank P. Adams investigated manifestation of dysconcisous Audism as Crab Mentality and implicit discriminatory attitudes in his published dissertation Does the Crab Theory Hold Water? Investigating Intragroup Discriminatory Attitudes Within the Deaf Community\\" http://frankpadams.com/upload/97152/documents/4F2720A3AF8D3329.pdf Active audism is when a person knowingly engages in audist behavior. The person knows the effects of audism, yet still engages in this behavior and has an audist attitude. Passive audism is when a person is engaging in audist behavior, yet does not have knowledge about the Deaf community's values. Passive audists do not think about how their actions or words concern deaf individuals, hearing individuals, or sign language. Ben Bahan describes audism in two forms: overt and covert audism. Overt audism is a term used to define Deaf people and their culture as inferior to hearing culture. In the medical field, this idea can manifest by looking at deafness as something to be fixed, but can also be applied to practices such as audiology, speech therapy, medicine psychology, social work and other fields. This does not mean that all institutions inherently practice audism but that they are revert to audiological tendencies. These two forms illustrate the exclusion of Deaf people from specific institutions or practices. Bahan notes inventions such as telephones, radios, or a lunch bell can be considered audist because they are sound-based technologies.Supalla, Sam. Bahan, Ben. \\"Bird of a Different Feather and For a Decent Living Student Workbook\\" pg. 183, DawnSignPress, 1994, Print ==History== The principles and ideas behind audism have been experienced by the Deaf community for many centuries, but the term \\"audism\\" was first coined in 1975 by Deaf scholar Tom Humphries in his unpublished essay. Humphries originally defined audism as, \\"the notion that one is superior based on one's ability to hear or behave in the manner of one who hears\\". Since then, other scholars, such as Harlan Lane in his book, Mask of Benevolence, have attempted to further expand on Humphries' definition to include different levels of audism: individual, institutional, metaphysical, and laissez-faire. As Humphries' definition stands, it only incorporates individual audism, which includes Deaf jokes, hate crimes, and low classroom expectations of Deaf people. The idea that there is systemic, or institutional, audism within society was originally proposed in Harlan Lane's Mask of Benevolence, as an extension of David T. Wellman's concept of institutional racism. It was further expanded by H-Dirksen Bauman, in Audism: Exploring the Metaphysics of Oppression, and again, by Richard Eckert and Amy Rowley, in Audism: A Theory and Practice of Audiocentric Privilege, and institutional audism is now described as, \\"a structural system of exploitative advantage that focuses on and perpetuates the subordination of Deaf Communities of origin, language, and culture\\". Despite scholars' best efforts to incorporate all aspects of audism, still, there is another important facet of audism. Scholars have noted that deaf people who used their voice had more societal rights than those deaf people who did not have the ability to speak. In attempt to quantify this relationship, Bauman extended the concept of phonocentrism proposed by Jacques Derrida, \\"the supremacy of speech and repression of nonphonetic forms of communication\\", and developed the term, metaphysical audism. Metaphysical audism refers to the idea of language being a distinguishing factor in what makes us human; however, with metaphysical audism, language becomes confused with speech, and in turn, speech becomes linked to being human. ==Origins of audism== The seeds of audism were reflected in the lack of early documentation and a misunderstanding of deaf people and their language. Limited evidence can be provided about the treatment of deaf individuals by ancient civilizations. However, the documentation that is provided shows a resistance towards deaf people as a functioning part of society. Aristotle's Poetics alluded that those labeled as \\"disabled\\" would be put to death for the benefit of the rest of society. During the time of the Renaissance, efforts to educate deaf individuals posed complications due to the lack of literacy from the vast majority of society, deaf and hearing alike. In New England during the pilgrimage to America, any variant from the category of the norm was grounds for witchcraft or sorcery. Richard Eckert coined the term laissez-faire audism to indicate the modern state of acknowledging members the Deaf community's humanity, but denying their independence, for example through pediatric cochlear implantation. ==Audism in the educational system== Audiological ideologies have shaped curriculum within Deaf Education. Because Deaf people make up 1% of the American population, teachers are less equipped to work with the needs of Deaf or hard of hearing students. In the USA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the Education for all Handicapped Children Act (EAHCA) allow deaf children to more easily participate in mainstream public education if their families so choose. These acts provide education policies that reinforced integration of deaf individuals into hearing society. Signed languages were generally replaced with Manually Coded English as a method of communication and Deaf/Hard of Hearing students were placed with hearing students in hopes that this would further speech development. Institutions such as the National Association of the Deaf (NAD) continue to work with U.S. Officials to improve these policies, claiming these educational practices were audist and create precedence of one language over another by implementing English as the primary language for instruction. ==Audism in the legal system== Lack of access to communication in trials of deaf individuals has resulted in mistrials attributed to factors including interpreter and CART provider error and unqualified interpretation, all contributing to an overall lack of understanding or misunderstanding by the judge and members of the jury. These factors have also led to unlawful sentences in some criminal cases. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires Deaf individuals be given equal access in the courtroom through a qualified interpreter. The law establishes stricter guidelines for interpreting licensure, aiming to reduce the number of errors in the courtroom.Couch, Kymberly Marie, \\"The Impact of American Sign Language Interpreter Licensure Laws on d/Deaf Defendants in Criminal Cases\\" (2017). Boise State University Theses and Dissertations. 1248. . Conversely, a deaf man convicted of rape in Norway successfully appealed for a shorter sentence by arguing his deafness constituted a mitigating circumstance, reducing his degree of culpability for the crime. The court's decision angered the Norwegian Deaf community, which perceived the rationale behind the reduced sentence as patronizing, ignoring the capacity of deaf individuals to reason and thus to be held fully accountable and to receive the same sentences as other, hearing, Norwegian citizens. Another example of audism in the legal system, was what happened to a man by the name of Magdiel Sanchez. This man was shot and killed in front of his house by a police officer for approaching them with a metal pipe, which according to his neighbors he used to communicate and ward off stray dogs. According to a news article from CNN there was a hit and run committed by Magdiel Sanchez’s father (he did not hit a person) and when the police arrived at the scene, Magdiel was on his porch and began to walk towards the officers with a metal pipe. The officers Sgt Christopher Barnes and, Lt Matthew Lindsey, yelled for Sanchez to drop his pipe; but being deaf he could not hear them. Sanchez’s neighbors who were on the scene, tried to tell the officers that Magdiel couldn’t hear them because he was deaf. While this may not be exactly audism, it does show that the legal system did not have any protocol for communicating with deaf people; nor did they have someway to identify, if a person is deaf or hard of hearing, such as signing “are you deaf?” to a person who does not respond to verbal demands. Domestic crimes committed among and against deaf individuals tend to have a lower investigation rate than domestic crime between hearing individuals. A study shows that deaf women have a higher rate of abuse than hearing women, although the disparity has attracted little attention for further research. Among deaf individuals incarcerated in Texas in 2004, 20% were judged \\"linguistically incompetent\\", unable to either understand the charges they faced or to meaningfully participate in the creation of their defense, while another 30% were \\"adjudicatively incompetent, unable to understand the legal proceedings without targeted instructional intervention. These statuses were the results of either lack of fluency in any language or functional illiteracy, respectively. As a result, it is unlikely that these deaf inmates had received their constitutional right to due process of law. However, all deaf inmates studied had nevertheless been convicted and incarcerated, possible violations of their constitutional rights. Notably, deaf individuals who were either ASL-dominant bilinguals equally comfortable in both ASL and English were the least likely to fall into either category and therefore the most likely to have received due process. ==Audism in linguistics== Audism can be closely linked to the term linguicism, or ideologies that pertain to the way in which an institution is facilitated and regulated in favor of a dominant culture through the basis of language. Linguicism highlights spoken language to be a part of the dominant culture and signed languages to be of the minority culture, expanding that those who use spoken language are provided with more accessible economic, social and political resources which give them an advantage over those who use signed languages.Deaf Gain: Raising the Stakes for Human Diversity Audism is linked to phonocentric values in defining linguistics. Linguistic terminology has been determined by sound based methodologies, for instance the concept of linearity in spoken languages fails to recognize the grammatical structures of visual-manual-kinesthetic based languages. Additionally, early twentieth century linguists determined those without sound-based languages did not possess any capacity for language while others romanticized sign languages or believed them to be primitive. However, additional linguists argue this claim minimizes the advances in Deaf Studies and the recognition of signed languages as a part of the linguistic lexicon.Deaf Studies: A Critique of the Predominant U.S Theoretical Direction For centuries, there has been controversy over whether linguistic theory pertains to signed languages. It was not until William Stokoe contested this argument and found structural evidence that linked ASL to linguistic rules that ASL was finally recognized as a language. These claims, however, are still contested by some lawmakers and educators due to the inability to recognize the rules of visual-modal languages and misconceptions of their origins outside of sound-based languages. ==Additional resources pertaining to audism== Personal accounts of audism have been documented from documentaries such as Audism Unveiled, a movie that discusses the oppression of deaf people and their personal struggles with audism. Other accounts can be seen through the research of academics such as Peter Hauser whose TedTalk illustrated the detriments audism has on the identity. His studied illustrated a connection between the lack of exposure to Deaf culture and a deaf person's self esteem.Paul Hauser, \\"Effects of Linguisticism and Audism on the Developing Deaf person,\\" TedxGallaudet March 6, 2015 ==Controversy== Activists in the Deaf community claim that audists harm Deaf culture by considering deafness a disability, rather than as a cultural difference. Some Deaf activists call cochlear implants the audists' tool of cultural genocide that is wiping out the Deaf community. As many as 95% of deaf children in the US are born to hearing parents. == Advocates for audist ideology== Alexander Graham Bell – inventor of the telephone. An avid supporter of eugenics, he published the essay Memoir Upon the Formation of a Deaf Variety of the Human Race which condemned intermarriage between Deaf individuals. He championed the oralist movement, his associated endeavors including pushing for the removal of sign language from Deaf schools to be replaced with his own alphabet called \\"Visible Speech\\", and striving to cure deafness. Horace Mann founded the first school for the Deaf in Connecticut but whose policies educational reform that pushed the oralist methods, such as a focus on lipreading and articulation in the education of deaf children. Garrick Mallery studied Indian culture and sign language for the Bureau of Ethnology in the Smithsonian Institution. Although he recognized the validity of modal languages, he argued that signed languages were inferior to oral languages on the basis that they could not be written down. ==See also== * Deafhood * Deaf culture * Models of deafness * Language Acquisition * Deaf Gain * Oralism * Deaf Education ==References== == External links == * *deafness.about.com – Continued information on audism Category:Deafness Category:Deaf culture Category:Discrimination ","title":"Audism"},{"id":"2235536","text":"1985 is a novel by English writer Anthony Burgess. Originally published in 1978, it was inspired by, and was intended as a tribute to, George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.The New York Times ==Plot introduction== 1985 is in two parts. The first part, called \\"1984\\", is a series of essays and interviews (Burgess is the voice of the interviewer and the interviewee) discussing aspects of Orwell's book. The basic idea of dystopia is explicated, and term \\"kakotopia\\" is also brought up, and explored etymologically. The etymology of the word \\"utopia\\" is also deconstructed. Burgess treats Orwell as being somewhat bound by his times. Orwell is seen somewhat as a war-exhausted Brit fearing the Soviet threat along with the spectre of atomic war. Orwell is treated as handling these ideas to the exclusion of other phenomena will come to alter British society. Burgess fairly well explicates the distinction between Orwell's \\"Ingsoc' and the more mundane \\"English socialism\\", as Burgess sees this actuality, in the Britain of his time. The second part is a novella set in 1985, seven years in the future at the time of the novel's being written. Rather than a sequel to Orwell's novel, Burgess uses the same concept. Based on his observation of British society and the world around him in 1978, he suggests how a possible 1985 might be if certain trends continue. The main trend to which he is referring is the expanding power of trade unions. In the hypothetical 1985 envisioned in the book, the trade unions have become so powerful that they exert full control over society; unions exist for every imaginable occupation. Unions start strikes with little reason and a strike by one union usually turns into a general strike. Another major theme of the novella is the rise of Islam as a major cultural and political force in Britain, due to large-scale immigration from the Middle East; London abounds with mosques and rich Arabs. Arab property ownership plays a major role in the story's economic backdrop. The protagonist is a school teacher, and somewhat of a proponent of Classicism. He is struggling within an education system which puts more stock in more directly practical approaches to study. He is also threatened by street toughs, from day to day. He gains status with them when he loses his professional status. They are outsiders, relative to the above-mentioned system. It is fashionable among them to embrace Classical studies, with a focus on, among other things, Greek and Latin linguistics. ==Plot summary== At the novella's beginning, the protagonist, Bev Jones, confronts the death of his wife. She was in a hospital when it caught fire. As the firemen's union was striking, the hospital burned to the ground.In reality, the UK firemen's union had taken industrial action for the first time ever, in 1977, presumably when Burgess was writing the novel. In that case real striking firefighters finally came to the burning hospital, following emergency troops. BBC, 1977: Firefighters strike over pay claim, 1977 Bev is left alone with his daughter Bessie, who is thirteen years old but sexually precocious and unable to comprehend the difference between reality and fantasy, due to a thalidomide-like drug taken by her pregnant mother. The death of his wife engenders in Bev a deep-seated hostility towards the union system – her last words were, \\"Don't let them get away with it\\". This is, however, not the first time Bev has been opposed to it, for he had previously been a history lecturer who stepped down as his work was considered expendable by the union-based system which favoured education of practical value. Employed as a confectioner, he goes to work one day despite his union being on strike. For working during a strike, his union membership is revoked, making him effectively unemployable. Knowing that he will soon lose his home, he takes Bessie to a state-run facility where she will be cared for with other girls like herself. Bev then becomes something of a vagrant, travelling around London and falling in with a group of similarly unemployable dissenters. With these, he engages in petty theft from shops to survive. Apprehended during one such sortie, he is sentenced to re-education at a state institution, which is neither a prison nor a psychiatric hospital, but contains elements of both. At the re-education centre, Bev is subjected to propaganda films and lectures, which have the aim of converting him into a useful member of society (a theme which Burgess also examines in A Clockwork Orange). He meets the powerful union official Pettigrew, who warns Bev that his day is over and that Syndicalism is the future of Britain. Despite this, Bev is unconverted and – having served his sentence – leaves as a free man. Having been informed that Bessie will be ejected from the care facility because he refuses to recant his beliefs, he returns to London. In need of an income and a place to live, he joins a network called The Free Britons, which aims to provide infrastructure and order during the increasing strike-related chaos sweeping Britain. Bev effectively sells his daughter as a wife to a wealthy sheik, who takes a fancy to her during a visit to the Al-Dorchester, reasoning that at least this way she will be safe and satisfied. Meanwhile, he discovers that The Free Britons is a front for an Islamic group aiming at the re-establishment of Britain as a Muslim state. Bev, because of his education, is employed as the mouthpiece of the Free Britons and called upon to report on the events of the general strike. He is frustrated when his work is censored by the leader, a man known as Colonel Lawrence. The spreading strike action reaches fever pitch and becomes a general strike, reported to the reader mostly in diary form. Charles III takes command of the country as it grinds to a halt. A few months after the strike, Bev is arrested again and sentenced to life in a secure institution, which again is neither prison nor hospital. The only way out of this facility is to be retrieved by a family member. There, he revives his teaching career by giving informal history lessons to other prisoners. As the years stretch on, his syllabus (which had started with Anglo Saxon England) passes through the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, and approaches the late 20th century. Snippets of news often circulate among the inmates, some of which suggest that the Muslim conversion of Britain is well-advanced (for example, it is claimed that inhabitants of the Isle of Man have recently discovered that a stimulant-depressant drug has been replacing alcohol in their beer for several years, in line with Muslim prohibitions). There is however no way in which the inmates can verify whether these news items are correct. Bev finds it increasingly difficult to explain the continuity of history in terms of the present. Unable to do so, Bev suggests that they can start over again and work their way back to the present, after which his class spontaneously dismisses itself. Alone at night, Bev slips out of the dormitory in which he sleeps, creeps out into the grounds of the institution, and kills himself by deliberately touching the electric fence. ==Release details== * 1978, US, Little Brown (), hardback (First edition).

The club was founded in 2013 following a merger between AO Kerkyra and AO Kassiopi. ==History== Athlitikos Omilos Kerkyra (Athletic Club of Kerkyra), or AO Kerkyra, was founded in 1969. For many years the club played in the local championship of Corfu. But in the season 1988–89, it played in Gamma Ethniki. In 2002, the club was promoted to Beta Ethniki and in the season 2004–05, it played in A Ethniki (Super League) for the first time in history. The club played 5 times totally in A Ethniki, the seasons 2005, 2007, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Athlitikos Omilos Kassiopi (Athletic Club of Kassiopi), or AO Kassiopi, was the football club of the village Kassiopi in north-east Corfu. The club was founded in 1984 and in 2012, it became champion of Delta Ethniki Group 5 and was promoted to Football League 2 for the first time in history. The next season it was finished in the third place of the championship of football (League 2 2012–13) and promoted to Football League (second division). In the same season (2012–13) Kerkyra was relegated from Super League to Football League. On account of a lot of debts, Kerkyra couldn't play in the professional league of Football League. So the owners of the historical club of Corfu agreed with the owners of Kassiopi for the merge of two clubs in order to Kerkyra continue its presence in professional leagues without debts. The intention was the new club to be named PAE Kerkyra but the court approved of the name PAE AOK Kerkyra. Kerkyra was dismissed by Super League and automatically got relegated to Football League as they were accused and proved to commit fake transfer of shares. Kerkyra was given the last position on the league table. Next season Kerkyra got 2nd place and gained promotion into Super League along with the 1st place team AEL.Οριστικό: Πέφτει η Κέρκυρα Confirmation of the league table In the period 2020-2021 the team did not declare participation in the Football League in order to participate in the fourth highest football league in Greece, Gamma Ethniki while it is expected to take the name \\"PAE Kerkyra\\". ==Crest and coloursCrest=== The emblem of the club is similar with the seal of the flag of the municipality of Corfu, an ancient Greek ship, a symbol of the island. That ancient Greek ship is the quadriceps trireme and symbolizes the power of the Phaeacians navy in antiquity. ===Colours=== Their colours are also the same; black and white. ==Stadium== Kerkyra Stadium Kerkyra's stadium was built in 1961. It is located in Garitsa, in the city of Corfu. The stadium is on the southern side of the city, next to the entrance to the airport. The stadium is part of Corfu's National Athletic Center (EAC). It has two stands, one large west and one smaller east, built in 1973. Chrysopatas was first placed in 1983. Since then, for 20 years, a few have changed. In 2003, headlamps were installed, while in 2005 all platforms were covered with plastic seats. The construction of the shelter over the big stand was made in 2007. The erection of an extra metallic pit on the northern horseshoe is a work that has been carcassing for many years. In 2010, a 200 seat slot was delivered as a temporary solution, but it is basically not used (no tickets are issued for it). The capacity of the new petal is projected to be 1,230 seats, though when completed. * Built in 1961 * Capacity of 2,685 (all seated) * Biggest attendance 5,000 (Kerkyra vs PAS Giannina in 1974) ==PlayersCurrent squad=== ==Technical team== * Manager: Kostas Christoforakis * Assistant manager: Petros Stoilas * General manager: Alexandros Analytis * Physical trainer: Sotiris Vino * Goalkeeping coach: Christos Vasalos * Technical manager: Tasos Venetis * Doctor: Alekos Koskinas * Physical therapist – sports Rrehabilitator: Argyris V.

Its purpose was to get U.S. Highway 66 paved from end to end and to promote tourism on the highway. The organization was similar to many that existed before the creation of federal highways in 1926, including those that promoted the Lincoln Highway and the National Old Trails Highway. John T. Woodruff of Springfield, Missouri was elected the first president. The association began to advertise the highway in magazines, on billboards, and brochures. The continued push to completely pave the highway and complete an unfinished section (Watson Road in St. Louis, Missouri) paid off, the road was fully paved and completed in 1938, including a cut-off across New Mexico, bypassing a loop through Santa Fe. The U.S. Highway 66 Association curtailed activities when World War II rationing of rubber and fuel disrupted leisure travel. In 1947, Jack and Gladys Cutberth revived the organization in Clinton, Oklahoma to promote \\"the shortest, fastest year-round best across the scenic West\\" with \\"800 miles of 4-lane highway\\". In 1955, construction began on the new Interstate Highway System. As these new interstates began to replace longer and longer sections of the old highway, the group in 1970 changed its name to the Main Street of America Association and continued to stand as a voice for the older highway. The association published its last brochure in 1974; the brochure's cover referenced the new interstate highways that would lead to its demise. In 1976, the association disbanded as U.S. Route 66 was now largely concurrent with I-55, I-44, I-40, I-15, and I-10. In 1984, the last section through Williams, Arizona was bypassed and in 1985 Route 66 was formally decommissioned.

Germany: University of Koeln. is the traditional wedding ceremony for Hindus. The wedding ceremonies are very colourful, and celebrations may extend for several days. The bride's and groom's home—entrance, doors, wall, floor, roof—are sometimes decorated with colors, balloons, and other decorations.Yee, A. (2008 May 17) Sari nights and henna parties. The Financial Times. The rituals and processes of a Hindu wedding vary widely, by region and community. Nevertheless, the Hindu wedding ceremony at its core is essentially a Vedic yajna ritual and three key rituals are almost universal: Kanyadan, Panigrahana, and Saptapadi—which are respectively, giving away of his daughter by the father, voluntarily holding hands near the fire to signify union, and taking seven ‘steps before fire’. (Each ‘step’ is a complete circuit of the fire.) At each step, promises are made by (in the long-form—see below) each to the other. The primary witness of a Hindu marriage is the fire-deity (or the Sacred Fire) Agni, in the presence of family and friends. Bajpai, S. (2011). The History of India - From Ancient to Modern Times, pp. 4, 73-74\\\\. Hawaii: Himalayan Academy Publications, . The ceremony is traditionally conducted entirely or at least partially in Sanskrit, considered by Hindus as the language of holy ceremonies. The local language of the bride and groom may also be used. The rituals are prescribed in the Gruhya sutra composed by various rishis such as Baudhayana and Ashvalayana. The pre-wedding and post-wedding rituals and celebrations vary by region, preference and the resources of the groom, bride and their families. They can range from one day to multi-day events. Pre- wedding ceremonies include engagement, which involves vagdana (betrothal) and Lagna-patra (written declaration),Pandey, R. (1969). Hindu Saṁskāras: Socio- religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, see Chapter VIII, pp. 153-233\\\\. . and the arrival of the groom's party at the bride's residence, often as a formal procession with dancing and music. The post-wedding ceremonies may include Abhishek, Anna Prashashan, Aashirvadah, and Grihapravesa - the welcoming of the bride to her new home. The wedding marks the start of the Grihastha (householder) stage of life for the new couple. In India, by law and tradition, no Hindu marriage is binding or complete unless the ritual of seven steps and vows in presence of fire (Saptapadi) is completed by the bride and the groom together. This requirement is under debate, given that several Hindu communities (such as the Nairs of Kerala or Bunts of Tulu Nadu) do not observe these rites. ==Eight forms of marriage== A Hindu bride in Gujarat during her wedding.Ancient Hindu literature, in for example the Asvalayana Grhyasutra and Atharvaveda, identifies eight forms of marriage. They are traditionally presented, as here, in order of religious appropriateness (prashasta). They also differ very widely in social acceptability.Lochtefeld, J.G. (2001). The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, p. 427\\\\. .staff article. (September 2011). Eight forms of Hindu Marriage and its custom. India Tribune. (Legal aspects are regulated mainly by the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.) * Brahma marriage - considered the religiously most appropriate marriage, and the most prevalent among Hindus in modern India. The father finds an educated man and proposes the marriage of that man's daughter to his son. The groom, bride, and families freely concur with the proposal. The two families and relatives meet, the daughter is ceremonially decorated, the father gives away his daughter in betrothal, and a Vedic marriage ceremony is conducted. * Daiva marriage - the father gives away his daughter along with ornaments to a priest as a sacrificial fee. This form of marriage occurred in ancient times when yajna sacrifices were prevalent. * Arsha marriage - the groom gives a cow and a bull to the father of the bride and the father exchanges his daughter in marriage. The groom takes a vow to fulfill his obligations to the bride and family life (Grihasthashram). * Prajapatya marriage - a couple agrees to be married by exchanging some Sanskrit mantras (vows to each other). This form of marriage is akin to a civil ceremony. The above four forms of marriage were considered socially proper, and religiously appropriate - prashasta - under Hinduism, since the rituals include vows from Vedic scriptures. Both the bride and groom commit to each other and share responsibilities to their families. The remaining four do not include vows and were considered aprashasta (inappropriate). Among these, two were socially acceptable: * Gandharva marriagethe couple simply live together out of love, by mutual consent, consensually consummating their relationship. The marriage is entered into without religious ceremonies and is akin to the Western concept of Common-law marriage. The Kama Sutra, and, in the Mahabharata, Rishi Kanva, the foster- father of Shakuntala, claim that this form of marriage is ideal. * Asura marriage - the groom offers a dowry to the father of the bride and the bride; both accept the dowry out of free will, and he receives the bride in exchange. This is akin to marrying off a daughter for money, and is considered inappropriate by Hindu Smriti-writers because greed, not what is best for the woman, can corrupt the selection process. The last two forms of marriage were not only inappropriate, but religiously forbidden: * Rakshasa marriage - where the groom forcibly abducts the bride against her will and her family's will. (The word Rakshasa means “devil”.) * Paishacha marriage - where the man forces himself on a woman when she is insentient: when she is drugged or drunken or unconscious. James Lochtefeld comments that these last two forms were forbidden but the marriages themselves were still recognized in ancient Hindu societies, not to allow these acts but rather to provide the woman and any resulting children with legal protection in the society. ==Key rituals== There is no single standard Hindu marriage ceremony. Regional variation is prevalent in the sequence of rituals comprising the ceremony. There is also considerable flexibility within each ritual. Variation reflects family traditions, local traditions, resources of the families and other factors. Three key rituals predominate, as follows.Kane, V. (1962). History of Dharmasastra.Roy, R. (2004). Saptapadi - The Seven Steps. University of Canterbury, UK: Ph.D. Thesis. Two are yajna. * Kanyadana - the giving away of his daughter by the father. * Panigrahana - a ritual in presence of fire, where the groom takes the bride's hand as a sign of their union. * Saptapadi - the crucial ritual. The term means ‘seven steps’, with each step corresponding (in the Long Form) to a pair of vows: groom to the bride, and bride to groom. The vows are pronounced in Sanskrit; sometimes also in the language of the couple. (For the Short Form see below.) Like Panigrahana, Saptapadi is performed in presence of fire, and in many weddings, after each of their seven oaths to each other, the groom and bride perform the ritual of agnipradakshinam: walking around the fire, with hands linked or with the ends of their garments tied together. The groom usually leads the bride in the walk.Sharma, A. (1985). Marriage in the Hindu religious tradition. Journal of Ecumenical Studies, 22 (1), 69-80. Fire is the divine witness (to the marriage), and after Saptapadi the couple are considered husband and wife. ===Kanyadaan=== Kanyadaan - a key ritual where the father gifts away from the daughter to the groom. In this picture, the father's hand is on the left, the bride and groom are on the right. The Kanyadaan ceremony is performed by the bride’s father. If the father has died, a guardian of the bride's choosing performs the ritual. The father brings the daughter, then takes the bride's hand and places it in the groom's. This marks the beginning of the ceremony of giving away the bride. The groom accepts the bride's hand, while the kama-sukta (hymn to love) is pronounced, in the presence of the father, the bride and the groom. The Kamasukta verse is:Prabhu, P.H. (2011). Hindu Social Organization, pp. 164-165\\\\. . > Who offered this maiden? to whom is she offered? Kama (the god of love) gave > her to me, that I may love her Love is the giver, love is the acceptor Enter > thou, the bride, the ocean of love With love then, I receive thee May she > remain thine, thine own, O God of love Verily, thou art, prosperity itself > May the heaven bestow thee, may the earth receive thee After this ritual recital, the father asks the groom to not fail the bride in his pursuit of dharma (moral and lawful life), artha (wealth) and kama (love). The groom promises to the bride's father that he shall never fail her in his pursuit of dharma, artha and kama. The groom repeats the promise three times. As per several stone inscriptions that have been found from 15th century in the Vijayanagara empire, to fight the epidemic of bride price (influenced by mahr), a community group of Brahmins created a social legislation to adopt the marriage system of kanyadana for their community. It was mandated that no money should be paid or received during marriage and those who do not follow are liable for punishment by the King. The above inscriptions also reinforce that system of social legislations within community groups was widely in practice as against personal laws based on religious scriptures. This repeated promise by the groom marks the end of the kanyadaan ritual in the Hindu wedding. ===Panigrahana=== A yajna during a Hindu wedding The ritual of Panigrahana comes after Kanyadaan. It is sometimes preceded by the vivaha-homa rite, wherein a symbolic fire is lit by the groom to mark the start of a new household.Williams, M.M. (1893). Indian wisdom; or, Examples of the religious, philosophical, and ethical doctrines of the Hindus. London: Luzac & Co. Panigrahana is the 'holding the hand' ritual as a symbol of the bride and groom’s impending marital union, with the groom acknowledging a responsibility to four deities: Bhaga signifying wealth, Aryama signifying heavens/milky way, Savita signifying radiance/new beginning, and Purandhi signifying wisdom. The groom faces west, and while the bride sits in front of him, with her face to the east, he holds her hand while the following Rig vedic mantra is recited: > I take thy hand in mine, yearning for happiness I ask thee, to live with me, > as thy husband Till both of us, with age, grow old Know this, as I declare, > that the Gods Bhaga, Aryama, Savita and Purandhi, have bestowed thy person, > upon me that I may fulfill, my Dharmas of the householder, with thee This I > am, That art thou The Sāman I, the Ŗc thou The Heavens I, the Earth thou In a Gujarati wedding this step is called Hast-Milap (literally, “meeting of hands”). The whole ceremony was timed around an auspicious time (Mauhurat) for this step and a few decades ago the wedding invitation would even list the time when this event was going to take place. ===Saptapadi – short form=== A Gujarati Hindu couple in post-marriage ceremonies, after Saptapadi. The tied clothing, represents lifelong bond formed during the seven promises ritual with fire as witness. The Saptapadi (Sanskrit “seven steps”/“seven feet”; sometimes called Saat Phere: “seven rounds” Office of the Registrar General, Government of India. (1962). On Hindu wedding rituals, v. 20, pt. 6, no. 2\\\\. New Delhi, India: Manager of Publications, Government of India. ) is the most important ritual of Vedic Hindu weddings, and represents the legal element of the Hindu marriage ceremony.Prinja, N. (2009 August 24). Hinduism & Weddings. London, UK: BBC News. The couple conduct seven circuits of the Holy Fire (Agni), which is considered a witness to the vows they make to each other.. In some regions, a piece of clothing or sashes worn by the bride and groom are tied together for this ritual. Elsewhere, the groom holds the bride's right hand in his own right hand. Each circuit of the consecrated fire is led by either the bride or the groom, varying by community and region. Usually, the bride leads the groom in the first circuit. In North India, the first six circuits are led by the bride, and the final one by the groom. In Central India and Suriname, the bride leads the first three or four circuits. With each circuit, the couple makes a specific vow to establish some aspect of a happy relationship and household for each other. In some South Indian weddings, after each saying a mantra at each of the seven steps, the couple say these words together: :\\"Now let us make a vow together. We shall share love, share the same food, share our strengths, share the same tastes. We shall be of one mind, we shall observe the vows together. I shall be the Samaveda, you the Rigveda, I shall be the Upper World, you the Earth; I shall be the Sukhilam, you the Holder together we shall live and beget children, and other riches; come thou, O beautiful maiden!\\"www.panchangam.com...www.sophieanand.com .. Hindu Rajput wedding, ceremonial offerings In North Indian weddings, the bride and the groom say the following words after completing the seven steps: :We have taken the Seven Steps. You have become mine forever. Yes, we have become partners. I have become yours. Hereafter, I cannot live without you. Do not live without me. Let us share the joys. We are word and meaning, united.

Some Indian weddings abroad symbolically maintain some of the customs in India. Above is a symbolic arrival of the groom on a horse (baraat), in Nottingham, England. In front is the band. Many Hindu weddings start with the milne (meeting) and swagatam (welcome) ceremony. This ritual is where the baraat (groom's procession party) arrives at the bride's home or the location where the bride is and marriage will be celebrated. The baraat typically includes dancing and joyous members of groom's family, relatives and friends. On their arrival, there is a ritual where key persons from the groom's side and bride's side are introduced to each other. The introduction is typically followed by jai mala (garland exchange between bride and groom) and a reception that serves food and drinks. Many other rituals and ceremonies are sometimes found in Hindu weddings, such as madhuparka, vivaah-homa, agni- parinayana, asmarohana, laja homa, abhishek, anna-prashashan, and aashir- vadah. All these ceremonies are carried out at the wedding location, typically at or near the bride's home. These additional rituals include the participation of the brothers, sisters, maternal/paternal relatives, guardians, or friends of the bride. In some parts of India, such as Gujarat and Northern India, a laja homa ritual called mangal pherā is performed where the couple make four circles around holy fire. It follows hasta milap (meeting of hands of the couple), but precedes saptapadi. The first three circles is led by the groom, and it represents three of four goals of life considered important in Hindu life - Dharma, Artha, Kama. The fourth circle is led by bride and it represents the fourth goal of life - Moksha.. After saptapadi, as hymns are being recited, the groom performs māņg sindoor ritual where a saffron or red color powder is marked into the parting of the wife's hair.. Instead of circling the fire and other steps, the rituals and ceremonies may be performed symbolically, such as stepping on small heaps of rice or throwing grains into the fire.. Some rituals involve rice or other grains, seeds and pastes. In these ceremonies, rice is thrown at the bride, groom or they kick a container containing the grain. Rituals include darshan, where the newly married couple are met, blessed and greeted by family and friends of the bride and groom. After the Hindu wedding is complete, the bride leaves for groom's home via groom's car. In groom's car, bride and groom sit together, and groom's younger brother drives the car. Bride's sisters also come with groom's family, when they arrive to groom house where Hindu family members of the groom welcome the newly wedded couple in a ritual known as grihapravesa (home coming/entry). This ceremony typically requires participation of the mother, father, brothers, and sisters, or other guardians of the groom. Ancient literature Singh, M. M. (1967). Life in North-Eastern India in Pre-Mauryan Times: With Special Reference to 600 BC-325 BC, pp. 48-49\\\\. Motilal Banarsidas Publisher. suggests the Hindu couple spent time with each other, but delayed the consummation for at least three nights following the wedding. Some scholars have proposed the observance of this rite in the past - known as chaturthikarma - “the rite performed on the fourth day of marriage”. Chaturthikarma is followed by most of South Indian communities Sharma, A. (1985). Marriage in the Hindu religious tradition. Journal of Ecumenical Studies, 22 (1), 69-80\\\\. as a possible basis for the validity of a marriage. Other scholars Banerjee, G. (1879). The Hindu Law of Marriage and Stridhan, pp. 108-110\\\\. Thacker, Spink, and Company. suggest saptapadi and regionally customary wedding rituals, not consummation, defines legal validity of a Hindu marriage. The Hindu Marriage Act of 1955, Article 7, is consistent with the latter. Government of India. (1955). The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, Section 7.2 . Chaturthikarma is not a common practice in Hindu communities. Jha, J. C. (1976). The Hindu Sacraments (Rites de Passage) in Trinidad and Tobago. Caribbean Quarterly, p. 40-52. In modern Hindu families, the couple proceed to honeymoon after grihapravesa. ===Rituals in Nepal=== Parbatiya wedding at Narayangarh, Chitwan The bride is ceremoniously decorated, in Hindu weddings, by her friends and family in regional dress, jewelry, and body art called Mehndi. The body art is produced from a mixture of henna and turmeric. Above a Nepali bride. In the Hindu culture of Nepal, marriage rituals are done by the Chhetri in a sixteen step process that centers on the household. The household is important during the marriage ritual because it is the center of the concept of mandala; the Chhetri's homes are considered to be domestic mandalas and so have roles as householders. The act of marriage brings men and women into the householder role. Marriage is the most important rite of passage for the Chhetris and is one of the most serious. Women move from their houses to the home of the groom after marriage. The ceremony is done in a precise and careful manner as to not bring bad luck to the families of the bride and groom; certain traditions, for example no one seeing the face of the bride until the end, are followed in order to ensure future prosperity. Prior to the marriage ceremony, there is no kinship between families of the bride and groom and the bride must be a virgin. The marriage ceremony consists of a series of rites that are performed over a two-day period between the houses of the bride and the groom. Within each home the enclosed area in the courtyard (jagya) and the kitchen are used the most; the jagya and the kitchen are considered the most important parts of the domestic mandala structure because it is where rice (an important part of the Chhetri's culture) is prepared and consumed. At the end of the ceremony is the establishment of the role of the wife and husband in the husband's home.. The first step in the marriage ceremony is called Purbanga. In the kitchen of their homes, the bride and the groom worship the seven Mother Goddesses as so to pay respect to their ancestors and ask for peace. In the second, third, and fourth step, the groom is then blessed by his mother and is taken outside to his jagya where his father and procession (janti) carry him and bring gifts for the bride to her house in a ceremony called dulähä anmäune. In the fifth step as the groom waits before the house of the bride, gifts of clothes and food are placed around the jagya; the father of the bride then places red paste on the groom's forehead indicating that he is no longer an outsider to his family. The sixth step is the performance of the Barani or welcoming for the groom and his janti as they enter the jagya. The father purifies the body of the groom using panchämrit (nectar from five pure liquids). A small feast is then held for the groom as the next steps in the marriage continue. After the small feast, the marriage process for the bride begins. The seventh step takes place in the kitchen of the bride where the process of kanya dan starts; the bride's parents give their daughter in marriage to her groom thereby allowing the bride to be a part of the groom's lineage and making the father's lineage secondary. After they wash their feet they dress in red and, in the eighth step, sit beside in each other in the jagya. They perform post-marriage rites as they make sacrificial offerings to the fire in the center of the jagya. During these rites the bride and groom perform tasks such as placing red powder in the hair of the bride and the bride eats leftover food of the groom and at the end the now husband gives his wife a personal name for which she is to be called by. After the post-marriage ceremony, the married couple being to leave the bride's home. In the ninth step, the husband and wife return to the kitchen of the wife and worship their ancestors and the seven Mother Goddesses. In the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth step, the couple leave the wife's house as she is given a garland from her parents; the wife and husband enter the jagya and are then escorted out riding on palanquins as they return to their permanent home of the husband. The thirteenth step beings once they enter the jagya of the groom and his virgin sisters welcome the wife in a ceremony called arti syäl. They unveil the bride and adorn her with flower garlands and sprinkle puffed rice on her (a sign of prosperity). The fourteenth step is completed once the bride promises gifts to the sisters; she then moves on the fifteenth step where she steps on piles of rice in a path toward the kitchen. The final step is a series of rites, the first of which is the bride worshiping the ancestors and deities of the husband; she then demonstrates her skills in handling rice to the husband's mother and sisters and then they entwine her hair. Finally, the mother unveils the bride again in front of the husband and in a ceremony called khutta dhog, the bride places the foot of the mother on her forehead thereby ending the marriage ceremony. ==Wedding and married life in Hinduism== While there are many rituals in Hinduism, such as those at birth and deaths of loved ones, the Hindu wedding is the most important and extensive personal ritual an adult Hindu undertakes in his or her life. Typical Hindu families spend significant effort and financial resources to prepare and celebrate weddings. ===Economics=== A fancy Indian wedding taking place in Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, India In 2008, Indian weddings market was estimated to be $31 billion a year. Various sources estimate India celebrates about 10 million weddings per year,CBS News. (2012 February 12). India's love affair with gold.Kitco Metals Inc. (2013 July 23). India, the Rupee, Import Duties, Gold and Diamonds. New York: Kitco Metals. and over 80% of these are Hindu weddings. The average expenditures exceed US$3,000 per wedding. Another $30 billion per year is spent on jewelry in India,IBEF - a trust established by the government of India. (May 2013). Gems and jewelry industry in India. with jewelry for weddings being the predominant market. In a nation with per capita annual income of $1,500,International Monetary Fund (IMF). (February 2013). India - Country Report 13/37. Washington DC: IMF. weddings are a major financial burden for the typical Hindu family. ===Law=== In India, where most Hindus live, the laws relating to marriage differ by religion. According to the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955, passed by the Parliament of India, for all legal purposes, all Hindus of any caste, creed or sect, Sikh, Buddhists and Jains are deemed Hindus and can intermarry. By the Special Marriage Act, 1954, a Hindu can marry a person who is not Hindu, employing any ceremony, provided specified legal conditions are fulfilled. By Section 7 of Hindu Marriage Act, and tradition, no Hindu marriage is binding and complete before the seventh step of the Saptapadi ritual, in presence of fire, by the bride and the groom together.Menski, W. (2001). Modern Indian Family Law, p. 26\\\\. Routledge, . In some cases, such as South Indian Hindu marriages, this is not required as the saptapadi is not performed. ===Married life=== A Vedic sage emphasized that the basis of happy and fulfilling married life is the sense of unity, intimacy and love between husband and wife both physically, mentally and spiritually. Hence wife is considered to be the Ardhangani of husband as per Hindu tradition. Marriage is not for self- indulgence, but is considered a lifelong social and spiritual responsibility. Married life is considered an opportunity for two people to grow as life partners into soul-mates.Jyoti, A. (2003 Mar-Apr).

McGavin was born in Paisley, Ontario, son of James McGavin, a saddler born in Catrine, Ayrshire, Scotland and Elizabeth Wright, born in Glasgow Scotland, daughter of James Wight and Jean Malcolm. He came to Manitoba in 1877. He received a medical degree from the Manitoba Medical College, and practised as a general physician in Plum Coulee.

He was married twice: first to Emily Christine Bryans in 1907 and then to Ida Nauer in 1918 after the death of his first wife. He first sought election to the Manitoba legislature in the 1910 provincial election, but lost to Liberal Valentine Winkler by 133 votes in the constituency of Rhineland. When he next ran in the 1927 election, he defeated Progressive candidate J.H. Black by 120 votes in Morden and Rhineland. (Black actually won a plurality of votes on the first count, but was defeated on transfers from the third-place candidate. Manitoba elections were determined by a single transferable ballot in this period.)

It reaches a height of 709 metres (2,326 feet) and is situated in the central part of the national park in the valley of Great Langdale. The fell is one of three fells which make up the picturesque Langdale Pikes (the others being Harrison Stickle and Loft Crag), one of the best-known areas in Lakeland. A \\"stickle\\" is a hill with a steep prominent rocky top, while a \\"pike\\" is a hill with a peaked summit, the name being therefore partly tautological. ==Topography== The Langdale Pikes form a raised rocky parapet around the southern and eastern edges of a high tableland centred upon Thunacar Knott. Pike of Stickle stands at the western end of this system and its crags fall south from the summit, presenting an arresting view from the valley floor 2,000 ft below, or from further afield. Loft Crag stands next along the rampart, with Thorn Crag and Harrison Stickle further to the east. 'Behind' Pike of Stickle to the north is the depression of Harrison Combe, beyond which are the twin tops of Thunacar Knott. Westward the height of the land gradually falls away to Martcrag Moor, a wide plateau with a few small tarns near the summit (1,795 ft). Martcrag Moor represents the end of the Central Fells as defined by Alfred Wainwright, providing a high-level connection to Rossett Pike in the Southern Fells. Pike of Stickle on the left, from the summit cairn of Pike of Blisco ==Geology== The rearward slopes show evidence of the Pavey Ark Member, pebbly sandstone and breccia. The Langdale face displays several strata: from the top The Lingmell Formation, Crinkle Member and Bad Step Tuff. These are composed, respectively, of tuff, lapilli- tuff and breccia; rhyolitic tuff and breccia; and rhyolitic lava-like tuff.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 38: BGS (1999) ==Summit== Despite the peaked profile the summit is wide enough for a sizeable cairn surrounded by a small level area. Loft Crag and Gimmer Crag steal the attention in the foreground while Bowfell impresses across Langdale. A wide swathe of the Southern Fells is in view, whilst even distant Skiddaw puts in an appearance.Mark Richards: The Central Fells: Collins (2003): ==Ascents== Pike of Stickle rises steeply from Langdale, culminating in a narrow tapering summit which gives excellent views of the head of the valley, the fells of Bow Fell and Crinkle Crags showing well. The fell is usually climbed from Great Langdale with either the New or Old Dungeon Ghyll Hotels as the starting points. There are a number of routes, the most common ascent being a path that slants across the hillside from the New hotel passing between Thorn Crag and Gimmer Crag and then turning left at the col. A quieter route is by Troughton Beck; the walker starts from the Old hotel and goes four kilometres (2½ miles) towards the head of the valley before bearing right and following a zigzag path at the side of Troughton Beck. This route gives the walker an unusual view of the fell from this unfrequented side. There is another route directly up the Stickle Stone Shoot: this route is steep and has become severely eroded in recent years and is no longer recommended as a means of ascent or descent. The Langdale or Borrowdale sides of Stake Pass can also be used, giving access onto Martcrag Moor. ==Stone axe factory== Pike of Stickle is the site of one of the most important neolithic stone axe factories in Europe. The most prominent quarries are situated above the scree slopes on the steep southern face of the fell. The factory was set up here because of a vein of greenstone, a very hard volcanic rock, which comes to the surface around the head of the valley. Evidence of axe manufacture have been found in many areas of Great Langdale but it is the screes of Pike of Stickle which have yielded the most discoveries. There is a small cave at the top of the Stickle Stone Shoot near the summit of the fell which was part of the stone axe factory. ==References== Image:Pike_of_Stickle_from_Troughton_Gill_B.jpgPike of Stickle as seen from Troughton Gill.

It is done for cosmetic purposes, to make the color of the anus more uniform with the surrounding area. Some treatments are applied in an office or salon by a cosmetic technician and others are sold as cream that can be applied at home. ==History== Pornographic film actors were the first to undergo the anal bleaching process, in an effort to lighten the color of their anuses to match the rest of their skin, although it has been suggested by Kristina Rose that this is not the case. As Brazilian waxing became popular, due to the popularity of smaller swimsuits and lingerie, the spread of pornography into the mainstream, and endorsement of the procedure by celebrities, women began noticing that their anuses were darker than the rest of their skin. The increase in the number of women engaging in anal sex has also contributed to women's concern over the appearance of their anus. To combat this perceived problem, anal bleaching began to gain appeal. Gay men also make use of this procedure. The procedure was briefly shown in 2004 near the end of an episode Cosmetic Surgery Live. One salon that performed the procedure received an increase in queries in 2005 attributed to an episode of Dr. 90210 on E!, when porn star Tabitha Stevens was filmed having her anus bleached. It garnered several mentions in movies such as Brüno, and Bridesmaids, and in magazines. The treatment was apparently first offered in the US in California in 2005; it was reported to be available at the same time in Australia. Spas outside of Hollywood were slow to begin offering it as a beauty treatment, with just one New York spa offering the service by 2007. Creams are now sold for use at home. Although the popularity of anal bleaching has not approached that of Brazilian waxing, it has garnered mainstream recognition over the past several years. ==Methods== There are several methods to carry out the anal lightening process. The most common method is to simply use an at-home lotion or gel to target the darkened anal and genital area and gradually fade the darkened area over time. ==Risks== Many of these cosmetics contained ingredients that would irritate the sensitive anal area, creating temporary discomfort and even burning, scarring, or incontinence. The process performed with creams containing hydroquinone is banned in some countries, such as the member states of the EU. In 2006, the FDA removed previous advice that stated hydroquinone was considered generally safe, as hydroquinone has been linked to ochronosis, where skin becomes permanently discoloured and disfigured, and because it may also be a carcinogen. However, its use is not banned in the United States and it is still in use. Other principal ingredients that are used in skin lightening cosmetics are arbutin and kojic acid. Arbutin, often also called bearberry, can be converted by the body into hydroquinone. Kojic acid was developed as a safer alternative to hydroquinone, however it is less effective at lightening and also carcinogenic. ==See also== * Labiaplasty * Vajazzle ==References== Category:Cosmetics Category:Body modification process Category:Body modification ","title":"Anal bleaching"},{"id":"2235615","text":"Bhaskararaya was Lalitaʻs devotee.

He was born in Prague (now capital of the Czech Republic) and was thus a citizen of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He lived in Vienna until the Nazi Anschluss in 1938, when he emigrated to Palestine. According to the biographical note on the Arcade Publishing editions of the English translations of his novels, Leo was a mathematician who formulated an algebraic equation which is named after him; he worked as a statistician for an insurance company. He was related to the biologist Max Perutz.Max Ferdinand Perutz OM FRS, obituary by Alan R. Fersht. During the 1950s he returned occasionally to Austria, spending the summer and autumn months in the market town of St. Wolfgang in the Salzkammergut resort region and in Vienna. He died in the Austrian spa town of Bad Ischl in 1957. He wrote his first novel, The Third Bullet, in 1915 while recovering from a wound sustained in the First World War. In all Perutz wrote eleven novels, which gained the admiration of Jorge Luis Borges, Italo Calvino, Ian Fleming, Karl Edward Wagner and Graham Greene. Wagner cited Perutz' novel The Master of the Day of Judgement as one of the thirteen best non-supernatural horror novels.N. G. Christakos, \\"Three By Thirteen: The Karl Edward Wagner Lists\\" in Black Prometheus: A Critical Study of Karl Edward Wagner, ed. Benjamin Szumskyj, Gothic Press 2007. == Overview == Perutz was born in Prague to a largely non- religious family of Jewish ancestry. They moved to Vienna, where he attended various schools and colleges before studying probability theory, statistics, actuarial science, and economics. Perutz' novels are short and are usually historical novels combining fast-paced adventure with a metaphysical twist. They are influenced by the work of E. T. A. Hoffmann, Arthur Schnitzler and Victor Hugo (whose work Perutz translated into German).Sorrel Kerbel, Jewish writers of the twentieth century (p.792-95), Taylor & Francis, 2003 Austrian fellow novelist Friedrich Torberg once characterized Perutz' literary style as the possible result of a little infidelity of Franz Kafka and Agatha Christie. The Marquis of Bolibar features the Wandering Jew appearing during Napoleon's campaign in Spain.Franz Rottensteiner, \\"German Language Fantasy since 1900\\" in Frank N. Magill, ed. Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature, Vol 3., (pp. 2391-2414) Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Salem Press, Inc., 1983. By Night Under the Stone Bridge is an episodic work whose separate stories are bound together by the illicit love shared, in their dreams, by a Jewish woman and the Emperor Rudolf II. In the posthumously-published Leonardo's Judas, da Vinci's quest for an appropriate face to give the betrayer in his Last Supper is interwoven with the squabble between a usurer and the merchant to whom he owes money. The title of his 1933 novel Saint Peter's Snow (also known in English as The Virgin's Brand), which is set in what was then the present day, refers to a drug which induces religious fervour; the Nazis, understandably, did not care for it. Critic Alan Piper considered it \\"a psychological detective story\\", although it has varyingly been categorised as science fiction or fantasy. Piper believed that the novel was decades ahead of its time due to the description of a hallucinogenic drug derived from an ergot fungus 10 years before the discovery of LSD. He also thought it astonishing that it discussed the experimental use of this hallucinogen on an isolated village 20 years before the 1951 Pont-Saint-Esprit mass poisoning, and proposed that ergot was the psychoactive ingredient used in the ancient mystery cults 40 years before this was put forward as a serious proposal. The Master of the Day of Judgement is a decidedly different mystery story about the circumstances surrounding an actor's death in the early twentieth century, and Little Apple concerns a First World War soldier's obsessive quest for revenge. In his discussion of German language fantastic literature, critic Franz Rottensteiner describes Perutz as \\"undoubtedly the finest fantasy author of his time\\". Literary scholar Alan Piper described Perutz's work as typically containing \\"an element of the fantastic, with dramatic plots featuring confusing and conflicting interpretations of events\\". In 1933, Perutz published his novel St Petri- Schnee, which would be published in English in 1935 as The Virgin's Brand. == Novels by Perutz in English translation == (Dates of publication are for the original German-language editions) * From Nine to Nine (1918) * The Marquis of Bolibar (1920)Andreas Dorschel, 'Dein Feuer, Bürschchen, brennt an einer kurzen Lunte', in: Süddeutsche Zeitung Nr. 218, 20 September 2004, p. 14. * The Master of the Day of Judgement (1921) * Turlupin (1924) * Little Apple (1928) * Saint Peter's Snow (1933) * The Swedish Cavalier (1936) * By Night under the Stone Bridge (1952) * Leonardo's Judas (1959) == Filmography == *The Adventure of Doctor Kircheisen, directed by Rudolf Biebrach (1921, based on the novel Das Mangobaumwunder) *', directed by Friedrich Feher (1922, based on the novel Die Geburt des Antichrist) *The Marquis of Bolibar, directed by Friedrich Porges (1922, based on the novel Der Marques de Bolibar) *Bolibar, directed by Walter Summers (UK, 1928, based on the novel Der Marques de Bolibar) *The Cossack and the Nightingale, directed by Phil Jutzi (1935, based on the novel Der Kosak und die Nachtigall) *Historia de una noche, directed by Luis Saslavsky (Argentina, 1941, based on the play Morgen ist Feiertag) *', directed by Luis Saslavsky (Spain, 1963, based on the play Morgen ist Feiertag) *Der Meister des Jüngsten Tages, directed by Michael Kehlmann (1990, TV film, based on the novel ') *St. Petri Schnee, directed by Peter Patzak (1991, TV film, based on the novel St. Petri Schnee) ==ReferencesFootnotes=Bibliography=== *Giffuni, Cathe. \\"\\"Leo Perutz: An English Bibliography,\\" Bulletin of Bibliography, Vol. 48 No. 4 December 1991, pp. 195–197. : == Further reading == * Hans Harald Müller: Leo Perutz, München, Verlag C.

Yolanda Vargas Dulché de la Parra (; (July 18, 1926 – August 8, 1999 Mexico City) was a Mexican writer principally known for the creation of the comic book character of Memín Pinguín and various telenovelas for Mexican television. She began her writing career as a way to supplement income for several newspapers, creating Memín Penguín in 1943. By 1960, she has successfully published a number of comic books, encouraging her husband, Guillermo de la Parra, to write as well. The two went on to create various successful telenovelas including Rubí, which has been redone for both television and film. In total Varga Dulché published over sixty titles in both Mexico and abroad. ==Life== Museum visitor looking at a mock set representing the telenovela Gabriel y Gabriela Vargas Dulché was born to poor parents Armando Vargas de la Maza and Josefina Dulché in Mexico City along with one sister, Elba. The family's unstable economic situation meant that the family moved frequently, causing the girls to change schools. However, this brought Yolanda into contact with various elements of Mexican society, which would influence the creation of her literary characters later. These frequent moves included a stay in the United States with her sister for a short time before moving back to Mexico City permanently. To make ends meet, Vargas Dulché worked at several jobs. She collaborated with Emilio Azcárraga Vidaurreta on radio station XEW-AM singing songs by Agustín Lara, Pedro Vargas and Toña la Negra and then forming a duet with her sister called \\"Rubia y Morena\\" which sang with Agustín Lara. Her career as a writer began to supplement income from singing. While working as a writer she met her husband Guillermo de la Parra with whom she had five children including actress Emoé de la Parra and Manelick de la Parra. She also has eleven grandchildren which include singers/actor Mané de la Parra and musician Alondra de la Parra. With her husband she had success as a writer, comic book illustrator and producer of telenovelas and films. With her own money, she constructed an entire town in the state of Durango, homes, schools, etc., which still exists. She also created a chain of hotels in Mexico. She died on August 8, 1999, after finishing a short autobiography called Aroma del tiempo. ==Career as a writer== During her career she was a singer, journalist, mother and businesswoman, but she is best known for her comic book work, especially Memín Penguín, and the writing and producing of telenovelas from the 1940s to the 1990s. She began her writing career as a way to supplement income from singing, beginning with the ESTO newspaper and Editorial Argumentos. She then began writing essays and stories for the El Pepín magazine, where she first created a black character in the 1940s which would develop into Memín Pinguín. The name was derived from her then boyfriends nickname of Pingo. She also wrote for Novedades de México. She then was hired by the Chamaco publication for three times what she was making before. However, because of personal conflict with her boss, she saved her money and when she could, left the publication to create her own company but this failed. Despite the failure she had published over a dozen profitable comic books by 1960. Her success encouraged her husband to write, creating his first success called Rarotonga. Their combined success provided sufficient income to found Grupo Editorial Vid and begin to produce telenovelas and films with their major productions being \\"Cinco rostros de mujer,\\" \\"María Isabel,\\" \\"Yesenía,\\", \\"Rubí,\\" \\"Ladronzuela\\" and Gabriel y Gabriela.\\" Her comic book writing style is considered to be unique and was popular in Mexico for over forty years, especially with the lower classes. At the height of her popularity she was the most read woman in Mexico, after only Corín Tellado in the Spanish language in general, with her comics selling 25 million copies a month. She had over sixty works published in Mexico as well as Indonesia, China, Japan, Italy, Colombia, the United States and the Philippines. She is considered to be a pioneer in popular literature in Mexico, called the \\"Queen of the comic books\\" . Her work received various recognitions including that of the first Convención Nacional de Cómic y Ciencia Ficción of Mexico City. In 2006, the book \\"La reina de la historietas de México\\" was published by Mexican cinematographer David Ramón and published by the Sociedad General de Escritores de México. In 2012, the Museo de Arte Popular in collaboration with Editorial Vid and Televisa paid homage to Vargas Dulché with an exhibition of her work, especially how it appeared on film and television. ==Works== Her major works include comics and screenplays for Mexican telenovelas, with some over her comic work crossing over into film and television. Her most important comic work is based on a character called Memín Pinguín, considered to be an icon of Mexican comic books. Created in 1943 the comic is about a black boy with exaggerated features who is a dreamer and a trickster but always does what is right. His name was inspired by her husband Guillermo de la Parra, who was called \\"pingo\\" by his colleagues because of his jokes. The character, which appears in film and radio along with comic books is an important part of modern Mexican popular culture still. In 1985, the Mexican ministry of education declared Memín Pinguín required reading in public schools because \\"it promotes respect for the family and institutions in students.\\" She began publishing other stories and comics in the 1950s. Other comic book characters include a series called El Pecado de Oyuki (Oyuki's Sin) based on a Japanese woman, and María Isabel, about a poor indigenous women who comes to the city with a little girl, who is not her daughter. María Isabel was played by actress Silvia Pinal for the film version. Her other major works were telenovelas, novels adapted into a series on television with a definite beginning and end. One of the most important of these include Rubí (1969), about a smart and beautiful woman whose main interests are money and power. A Mexican telenovela (2004) version of Rubí stars Bárbara Mori, Eduardo Santamarina, Jacqueline Bracamontes, Sebastián Rulli and Ana Martín, and a teleserye version of the story was created in the Philippines in 2010. Other successful radio novels and telenovelas include Cinco rostros de mujer (1947), Zorina (1949), Ladronzuela (1949) Yesenia (1970), Encrucijada (1970), El amor de María Isabel (1971), Gabriel y Gabriela (1982) and Alondra (1995) . ==References== ==External links== * Category:1926 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Mexican screenwriters Category:Mexican comics writers Category:Mexican women writers Category:Writers from Mexico City Category:Telenovela writers Category:Female comics writers Category:Women soap opera writers Category:20th-century Mexican women writers Category:Mexican people of French descent Category:20th-century screenwriters ","title":"Yolanda Vargas Dulché"},{"id":"2235790","text":"São Gião is a parish (freguesia in Portuguese), in the North of Portugal, on Serra da Estrela, the highest mountain range in Portugal.

The silver specie standard was widespread from the fall of the Byzantine Empire until the 19th century. Following the discovery in the 16th century of large deposits of silver at the Cerro Rico in Potosí, Bolivia, an international silver standard came into existence in conjunction with the Spanish pieces of eight. These silver dollar coins played the role of an international trading currency for nearly four hundred years. In 1704, following Queen Anne's proclamation, the British West Indies became one of the first regions to adopt a gold standard in conjunction with the Spanish gold doubloon coin. In 1717, the master of the Royal Mint, Sir Isaac Newton, introduced a new mint ratio as between silver and gold, and this had the effect of putting Britain onto a de facto gold standard. Following the Napoleonic Wars, the United Kingdom introduced the gold sovereign coin and formally adopted a gold standard in 1821. At the same time, revolutions in Latin America interrupted the supply of silver dollars (pieces of eight) that were being produced at the mints in Potosi, Mexico, and Lima, Peru. The British gold standard initially extended to some of the British colonies, including the Australasian and Southern African colonies, but not to its North American colonies, British India, or to Southeast Asia. The Province of Canada adopted a gold standard in 1853, as did Newfoundland in 1865. In 1873, Imperial Germany changed over to the gold standard in conjunction with the new gold mark coin. The United States changed over to gold de facto in the same year, and over the next 35 years, all other nations changed to gold, leaving only China and the British colonies of Hong Kong and Weihaiwei on the silver standard. The silver standard finally came to an end when it was abandoned by China and Hong Kong in 1935. ==Relative value of silver and gold== Since the time that silver was discovered by the Spanish in the New World in the 16th century, until the latter half of the 19th century, the value of gold in relation to silver maintained a relatively stable ratio of 15½:1. The reason for the subsequent sharp decline in the relative value of silver to gold has been attributed to Germany's decision to cease minting the silver thaler coins in 1871. On 23 November 1871, following the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, Bismarck exacted one billion dollars in gold indemnity, and then proceeded to move Germany towards a new gold standard which came about on 9 July 1873 with the introduction of the gold mark. \\"Monetary Madhouse\\", Charles Savoie It has also however been suggested by Nevada Senator John Percival Jones in 1876 in a speech to the US Senate, that the downward pressure on the market value of silver began somewhat earlier with the formation of the Latin Monetary Union in 1866. Jones argues that the Latin Monetary Union involved a partial demonetization of silver. Silver made a partial comeback in the first decade of the 20th century, such that the silver dollar coins of the Straits Settlements and silver peso coins of the Philippines had to be made smaller in size, and with a reduced silver content in order to prevent their silver value exceeding their recently established gold exchange value. An even larger rise in the price of silver after the First World War caused the Royal Mint in London to reduce the silver content of the sterling coinage. But silver never returned to the 15½:1 ratio of the first half of the 19th century, and the predominant long term trend was that silver continued to decline in value against gold. Nowadays the ratio in relation to the value of gold, although variable, is more of the order of 70:1. 'Austin' gold information network ==Bohemia== Beginning in 1515, silver coins were minted at the silver mines at Joachimsthal - Jáchymov (St. Joachim's Valley) in Bohemia, now part of the Czech Republic. Although formally called Guldengroschen, they became known as Joachimsthalers, then shortened to thaler. The coins were widely circulated, and became the model for silver thalers issued by other European countries. The word thaler became dollar in the English language. ==Imperial China== China had long used silver ingots as a medium of exchange, along with the cast copper-alloy cash. The use of silver ingots can be traced back as far as the Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD). But prior to the Song dynasty (960–1279), those silver ingots were used mainly for hoarding wealth. During the Song dynasty, for the first time in history the government became the sole issuer of paper currency after 1024, but cast coins and silver ingots were still used as a medium of exchange. In the Shanyuan Treaty, signed with the state of Liao in 1004, Song China agreed to pay an annual indemnity or tribute of 100,000 tael of silver and 200,000 bolts of silk. This was the first time bulk silver in tael (Chinese: 銀兩) was used as indemnity in a treaty with a foreign power. Silver ingots had a shape similar to a boat or a Chinese shoe during the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368). This became an ordinary shape for silver ingots during the following centuries. The use of silver as money was established at the very time of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Paper money was first issued in 1375 by the founder Hongwu Emperor amid the ban of silver as medium of exchange. But due to the increasing depreciation, the paper money became basically worthless and the ban on silver usage was finally lifted in 1436 (1st year of the Zhengtong Emperor). Meanwhile, silver was made much available through foreign trade with the Portuguese and the Spanish, in the beginning of the 16th century. The great tax reform by the statesman Zhang Juzheng in 1581 (9th year of the Wanli Emperor) simplified the taxation and required all the tax and corvee to be paid in silver. This can be seen as an indication of the firm position of silver in the monetary system of the Ming. However the reform would not have been a success or even feasible if the enormous amounts of silver had not been available through trade and imports from the Americas, mainly through the Spanish. During the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), silver ingots were still used, but various foreign silver dollars had become popular in the Southern coastal region through foreign trade since the mid-Qing era. It was apparent that the silver ingots became awkward and more complicated to use vis à vis the foreign silver dollars, which could be counted easily, given their fixed specification and fineness of silver. However, the Qing dynasty very much resisted the idea of minting a silver coin of their own. It was not until late Qing, in 1890, that the first circulating silver coin was introduced by Guangdong province. The coin was at par with the Mexican peso, and soon this issue was emulated by other provinces. For these silver coins, the tael was still seen as the proper monetary unit, as the denomination of the coins were given as 0.72 tael (specifically: 7 mace and 2 candareens). Note for the treaties signed between the Qing dynasty and the foreign powers the indemnities were all in tael of silver, except for the Treaty of Nanking, where the silver dollar was indicated. (See the Treaties of Tientsin, Convention of Beijing, Treaty of Shimonoseki and Boxer Protocol). It was not until 1910 that the \\"yuan\\" (Chinese: 圓, literally \\"roundness\\"), was officially announced as the standard monetary unit. The yuan was subdivided into 10 jiao or 100 fen, and specified as 0.72 tael of 900 fineness silver. The next year, 1911, the so-called \\"Great Qing Silver Coin\\" one yuan (dollar) was issued, but soon after the dynasty was replaced by the Republic. The silver standard was again adopted and codified in 1914 by the newly established republic, with one yuan still being equal to 0.72 tael of 900 fineness silver. After the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) unified the country in 1928, the yuan was again announced as the standard unit in 1933, but this time the relationship of the yuan to the tael was abolished, as one yuan was now equal to 26.6971 grams of 880 fineness silver. In the same year, 1933, while most of the Western countries (especially Britain and USA) had left the gold standard because of the Great Depression, it was said that China almost avoided the depression entirely, mainly due to having stuck to the silver standard. However, the US silver purchase act of 1934 created an intolerable demand on China's silver coins, and so in the end the silver standard was officially abandoned in September 1935 in favor of the four Chinese national banks' \\"legal note\\" issues. China would be the last to abandon the silver standard, along with the British crown colony of Hong Kong. China's use of silver as a medium of exchange is reflected in the name for bank \\"銀行\\" (literally \\"silver house\\" or \\"silver office\\") and for the precious metal and jewel dealer \\"銀樓\\" (literally \\"silver building\\" or \\"silver shop\\"). ==Germany== After its victory in the Franco- Prussian War (1870–71), Germany extracted a huge indemnity from France of £200,000,000 in gold, and used it to join Britain on a gold standard. Germany's abandonment of the silver standard put further pressure on other countries to move to the gold standard. ==Ancient Greece== The first metal used as a currency was silver, more than 4,000 years ago, when silver ingots were used in trade. During the heyday of the Athenian empire, the city's silver tetradrachm was the first coin to achieve \\"international standard\\" status in Mediterranean trade. ==Republican China and Hong Kong== Republican China, along with the British colony of Hong Kong, would be the last to abandon the silver standard. In October 1934, the National Government of Republic of China increased the silver-based export duty and adjusted the duty with an so-called \\"equalization charge\\", making the duty based on the foreign currencies. The Government later issued a new currency called fa-pi. These changes were responses to the deflation in China caused by the US Silver Purchase Program in 1933. The US purchase of silver in the International market increase the price of silver, causing an outflow of silver in China who based the economy on silver standard currency, which forces China to abandon the silver standard. Hong Kong abandoned the silver standard in September 1935. Hong Kong then adopted the gold exchange standard and the Hong Kong dollar took on the exact value of one shilling and three pence (1s 3d) sterling. ==India== The Indian rupee is derived from the Rūpaya (silver is called rūpa in Sanskrit) a silver coin introduced by Sher Shah Suri during his reign from 1540 to 1545. Since this is around about the same time that the Spanish discovered silver at the Cerro Rico in Potosí, the silver value of the rupee maintained a stable relationship with gold right up until the early 1870s. From 1871, the value of silver depreciated relative to gold, due to the drop in demand for silver in the mints of Europe and North America, as those countries changed over to the gold standard. This had severe consequences for the rupee and it resulted in the fall of the Rupee. Following the Fowler report, India adopted the gold exchange standard in the year 1898, fixing the value of the rupee at exactly one shilling and four pence (1s 4d) sterling.\\"India's Balance of Indebtedness 1898-1913\\" ==Persia== The dirham was a silver coin originally minted by the Persians. The Caliphates in the Islamic world adopted these coins, starting with Caliph Abd al-Malik (685-705). Silver remained the most common monetary metal used in ordinary transactions until the 20th century. Safavid era Gold coins were minted for the king, but these coins were more suitable for use and served as gifts on occasions, especially Nowruz. However, silver was a precious and high-quality currency for tax, cyber and commercial purposes. Silver coins were higher in comparison with many other countries. When the coin-masters of the coin melted the European coins or the crack, they were purified them before they were minted again in the form of Iranian currency. Usually the weight of the coins was correct, so that businessmen and government agents used both for a major payment of bags containing a certain number of coins. These bags have a guaranteed value of 50 Toman. A special observer, Sarrafbashi, was in charge of the quality of coins inside the bags, which personally sealed them. This monitoring of money certainly survived until the end of the fourteenth century. From the beginning of the Islamic Empire, the dinar was a monetary unit. In the year 1260, the Mughal was presented with the Toman, which in the words meant 10 thousands. The word was originally used to refer to 10,000 dinars of gold. However, after the year 1500, during the Safavid dynasty, Toman was a unit for calculation, not a gold coin. In practice, the value of the Toman fluctuated and was not always equal to 10,000 dinars. Also, the Toman of Tabriz or Iraq was often four times the value of the Toman of Khorasan. Exports of metal money from Iran in the seventeenth century were followed by sea and land, and generally more exports included coins to bullion. Given that the tendency toward gold to keep its value historically longer than the West in relation to silver in India, it was often preferable to export to India, since at least until the 1080s of the lunar year in India, and in particular the Cromandal (south-east coast India) had a better rate. However, almost always silver was preferred to trade with the East, although it naturally depended on the prices of silver and commodities in India. Iran's rulers repeatedly issued orders against coin exports, but since the merchants could easily escape the regulations by bribing the officers, their results were temporary. During the Safavid period, the first ban on the coin occurred in 1618 during the reign of Shah Abbas I. Afsharids With the fall of the Safavid in 1723, their monetary policy continued to be maintained by Nader Shah, who maintained the same weight and purity for coinage between 1723 and 1741. In this year, instead of continuing to follow the pattern of the traditional Iranian criterion, he made a coin draw on India based on the pattern of India to simplify trade between the two countries. Zand Although Karim Khan was known as the \\"greatest ruler of Iran\\" since 1764 with broad, independent or semi-autonomous sectors, there was no monetary unity in the country. The regional monetary system continued to work even when the national mint began to beat coins of equal weight and purity. Qajar The advent of the Qajar dynasty began in the late eighteenth century with the same Safavid monetary system. In short, in this system, the common currency was coins that were manually multiplied in the mint of all major cities and managed by privileged holders who paid royalties. The value of money was theoretically based on their precious metal content, which was guaranteed by the government. The Qajar period's monetary system was likewise pre-disintegrated and decentralized. There were two types of Iraqi and Tabrizi Tomans (used most of Iran) plus Tuman Khorasani (used in Eastern Iran). Pahlavi Following the fall of the value of silver in the late 1920s and the early 1930s, the Pahlavi government experienced a serious monetary crisis. The Pahlavi government first tried to redirect the gold standard by the March 28, 1930 law. But when faced with difficulties, the Qajars' short-term strategy was chosen; that is, to stay on the silver standard. The law of March 13, 1932 stipulated that until the return to normal economic situation and the stability of the possibility of paying with gold or gold-based foreign currency suspended due to the economic crisis, the National Bank (Bank Melli Iran) was allowed to receive no silver coins or paper money in circulation which may be offered with a gold purchase (coin, bullion, or foreign currency). However, Bank Melli should pay Rial cash against paper money and nickel coins if there is a demand without limitation, for each coin in either Tehran or other provinces. Although the paper money was very important in the Reza Shah government, older attitudes were still expected. For example, the idea that the metal is the base of real money is found in this rule of law that the paper money is backed by gold or foreign currency. However, the passage to the new currency system was one of the achievements of Reza Shah's reign. ==Spain== Rich deposits of silver in the Spanish colonies of the New World allowed Spain to mint great quantities of silver coins. The Spanish dollar was a Spanish coin, the \\"real de a ocho\\" and later peso, worth eight reals (hence the nickname \\"pieces of eight\\"), which was widely circulated during the 18th century. By the American Revolution in 1775, Spanish dollars backed paper money authorized by the individual colonies and the Continental Congress. In addition to the American dollar, the 8-real coin became the basis for the Chinese yuan. ==Great Britain== Great Britain's early use of the silver standard is still reflected in the name of its currency, the pound sterling, which traces its origins to the early Middle Ages (see Anglo-Saxon pound), when King Offa of Mercia introduced the silver penny, which copied the denarius of Charlemagne's Frankish Empire. The early silver pennies were struck from fine silver (as pure as was available). However, in 1158, King Henry II introduced Tealby penny. English currency was almost exclusively silver until 1344, when the gold noble was put into circulation. However, silver remained the legal basis for sterling until 1816. In 1663, a new gold coinage was introduced based on the 22 carat fine guinea. Fixed in weight at to the troy pound from 1670, this coin's value varied considerably until 1717, when it was fixed at 21 shillings (21/-, 1.05 pounds). However, this valuation overvalued gold relative to silver compared to other European countries. British merchants sent silver abroad in payments while exports were paid for with gold. As a consequence, silver flowed out of the country and gold flowed in, leading to a situation where Great Britain was effectively on a gold standard. In 1816, the gold standard was adopted officially, with the silver standard reduced to 66 shillings (66/-, 3.3 pounds), rendering silver coins a \\"token\\" issue (i.e., not containing their value in precious metal). The economic power of Great Britain was such that its adoption of a gold standard put pressure on other countries to follow suit. ==United States== The United States adopted a silver standard based on the Spanish milled dollar in 1785. This was codified in the 1792 Mint and Coinage Act, and by the federal government's use of the Bank of the United States to hold its reserves, as well as establishing a fixed ratio of gold to the US dollar. This was, in effect, a derivative silver standard, since the bank was not required to keep silver to back all of its currency. This began a long series of attempts for America to create a bimetallic standard for the US dollar, which would continue until the 1920s. Gold and silver coins were legal tender, including the Spanish real. Because of the huge debt taken on by the US federal government to finance the Revolutionary War, silver coins struck by the government left circulation, and in 1806 President Jefferson suspended the minting of silver coins. The US Treasury was put on a strict hard money standard, doing business only in gold or silver coin as part of the Independent Treasury Act of 1846, which legally separated the accounts of the federal government from the banking system. However the fixed rate of gold to silver overvalued silver in relation to the demand for gold to trade or borrow from England. Following Gresham's law, silver poured into the US, which traded with other silver nations, and gold moved out. In 1853 the US reduced the silver weight of coins, to keep them in circulation, and in 1857 removed legal tender status from foreign coinage. In 1857, the final crisis of the free banking era of international finance began, as American banks suspended payment in silver, rippling through the very young international financial system of central banks. In 1861 the US government suspended payment in gold and silver, effectively ending the attempts to form a silver standard basis for the dollar. Through the 1860–1871 period, various attempts to resurrect bi-metallic standards were made, including one based on the gold and silver franc; however, with the rapid influx of silver from new deposits, the expectation of scarcity of silver ended. The combination that produced economic stability was restriction of supply of new notes, a government monopoly on the issuance of notes directly and indirectly, a central bank, and a single unit of value. As notes devalued, or silver ceased to circulate as a store of value, or there was a depression, governments demanding specie as payment drained the circulating medium out of the economy. At the same time there was a dramatically expanded need for credit, and large banks were being chartered in various states, including those in Japan by 1872. The need for stability in monetary affairs would produce a rapid acceptance of the gold standard in the period that followed. The Coinage Act of 1873, enacted by the United States Congress in 1873, embraced the gold standard and de-monetized silver. Western mining interests and others who wanted silver in circulation labeled this measure the \\"Crime of '73\\". For about five years, gold was the only metallic standard in the United States until passage of the Bland–Allison Act on February 28, 1878, requiring the US Treasury to purchase domestic silver bullion to be minted into legal tender coins co-existent with gold coins. Silver Certificate Series 1878 was issued to join the gold certificates already in circulation. By acts of Congress in 1933, including the Gold Reserve Act and the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, the domestic economy was taken off the gold standard and placed on the silver standard for the first time. The Treasury Department was re-empowered to issue paper currency redeemable in silver dollars and bullion, thereby divorcing the domestic economy from bimetallism and leaving it on the silver standard, although international settlements were still in gold. A History of Money and Banking in the United States; Murray Rothbard. . (2005) This meant that for every ounce of silver in the U.S. Treasury's vaults, the U.S. government could continue to issue money against it. However, stamp overprints which were used under the Silver Purchase Act of 1934 to finance the nationalization of U.S. silver mines, and also carried taxes ranging from 1¢ to $1,000, ended in 1943.https://www.mysticstamp.com/info/this-day-in-history- june-19-1934/#:~:text=To%20help%20stabilize%20its%20value,stored%20or%20made%20into%20coins. These silver certificates were shredded upon redemption since the redeemed silver was no longer in the Treasury. With the world market price of silver having been in excess of $1.29 per troy ounce since 1960, silver began to flow out of the Treasury at an increasing rate. To slow the drain, President Kennedy ordered a halt to issuing $5 and $10 silver certificates in 1962. That left the $1 silver certificate as the only denomination being issued. On June 4, 1963, Kennedy signed Public Law 88-36, which marked the beginning of the end for even the $1 silver certificate. The law authorized the Federal Reserve to issue $1 and $2 bills, and revoked the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, which authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue silver certificates (by now limited to the $1 denomination). Because it would be several months before the new $1 Federal Reserve Notes could enter circulation in quantity, there was a need to issue silver certificates in the interim. Because the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 granted the right to issue silver certificates to the president, Kennedy issued Executive Order 11110 to delegate that authority to the Treasury Secretary during the transition. Silver certificates continued to be issued until late 1963, when the $1 Federal Reserve Note was released into circulation. For several years, existing silver certificates could be redeemed for silver, but this practice was halted on June 24, 1968. Finally, President Richard Nixon announcedhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRzr1QU6K1o that the United States would no longer redeem currency for gold or any other precious metal, forming the final step in abandoning the gold and silver standards. This announcement was part of the economic measures now known as the \\"Nixon Shock\\". Due to the monetary policy of the U.S. Federal Reserve, calls for a return to the gold standard have returned. Some states have chosen to use a loophole in the Federal Reserve Act that gives individual states the right to issue currencies of gold or silver coins or rounds. This was done because the Federal Reserve Act does not allow them to print their own currency if they wished. As of January 2012, Utah allowed the payment of debt to be settled in silver and gold, and the value of the American silver or gold rounds used was pegged to the price of the given precious metal. Payment in some cases can be requested to be made in silver or gold rounds. As of 2011, eleven other U.S. states were exploring their options to possibly make similar changes like Utah.https://money.cnn.com/2011/03/29/news/economy/utah_gold_currency/index.htm ==See also== * Bimetallism * Digital gold currency * Executive Order 11110 * Free silver * Full-reserve banking * Fungibility * Gold standard * Legal tender * Representative money * Silverite * Silver as an investment * Silver certificate (United States) * Silver coin * Store of value * United States one-dollar bill — details of the silver certificates of 1878–1963 ==Notes== ==References== Category:Early Modern economics Category:History of banking Category:History of international trade Category:Monetary policy Category:Metallism Category:Silver ","title":"Silver standard"},{"id":"2235823","text":"Frederic Young Newton (April 7, 1870–May 17, 1959) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada.

He was re-elected by 231 votes in the 1914 provincial election, in the constituency of Roblin. During this period, Newton served as a backbench supporter of Rodmond Roblin's government. The Roblin government was forced to resign amid scandal in 1915, and the Conservatives were badly defeated in that year's provincial election. Newton was one of only five Conservatives to retain his seat, and was the only Conservative elected in an anglophone riding. He resigned his seat in 1917, after a report of the province's Paterson Commission found evidence of road frauds in his constituency. Newton sought a return to the legislature in the 1920 provincial election, but lost to Farmer candidate Henry Robson Richardson by 104 votes. He tried again in the 1922 election, and this time defeated Richardson by nine votes. The election was won by the United Farmers of Manitoba, and Newton served on the opposition benches. He was re-elected in the 1927 election, and again served as an opposition member. In the 1932 election, he lost to independent Progressive William Westwood by 609 votes.

CHAPS was originally established in London by the Bankers Clearing House in February 1984, transferring to the CHAPS and Town Clearing Company Limited in December 1985.https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly- bulletin/1987/recent-developments-in-uk-payment-clearing-systems This company also operated the 'town clearing', where cheques cleared the same day between the 'town' bank branches in central London.https://www.chequeandcredit.co.uk/information-hub/history- cheque/clearings-early-days Town clearing had been the forerunner of the CHAPS system, and was finally closed in 1995. With the closure of the town clearing, the operating company was renamed to CHAPS Clearing Company Limited (informally CHAPS Co). Responsibility for the CHAPS system transferred from it to the Bank of England in November 2017. On 20 August 2018, the first non-bank institution, ipagoo LLP, joined the CHAPS scheme. ==Description== A CHAPS transfer is initiated by the sender to move money to the recipient's account (at another banking institution), where the funds need to be available (cleared) the same working day. Unlike with a bank giro credit, no pre-printed slip specifying the details of the recipient is required. Unlike cheques, the transfer is performed in real time, removing the issue of float or the potential for payments to be purposely stopped by the sender or returned due to insufficient funds, even after they appear to have arrived in the destination account. CHAPS is used by twenty direct participants, including the Bank of England, and over 4,500 indirect participants (who process transactions via agency arrangements with direct participants). In its first year of operation, average daily transactions numbered 7,000, with a total annual value of £5 billion. In 2004, twenty years later, average daily transactions numbered 130,000, with an annual value of £300 billion. In 2010 there were 32 million CHAPS transactions, totalling over £61 trillion,CHAPS Facts and Figures , UKPA. Retrieved 24 October 2011. down from £73 trillion in 2008. CHAPS used to offer euro fund transfers as a member of the EU-area settlement system TARGET, but this service closed on 16 May 2008. The total value of these in 2007 was £57 trillion. As well as making transfers originated by banks themselves, CHAPS is frequently used by businesses for high-value payments to suppliers, by mortgage lenders issuing advances, and by solicitors and conveyancers on behalf of individuals buying houses. ==Costs and problems== CHAPS transfers are relatively expensive, with banks typically charging as much as £35 for a transfer. The cost of fast transfers and the low speed of free transfers (such as BACS) was a subject of controversy in the UK, until immediate transactions became available from the Faster Payments service.Faster Payments , UK Payments Administration, 2010. Retrieved 24 October 2011. Problems can arise from delays, such as when an exceptional workload at a bank results in the money being cleared too late in a working day to complete related transactions, or inadequate instructions, when a bank is not given sufficient information to know where to credit the money, or a human delay in operating the machines. ==Participants== As of October 2019 the CHAPS participants are: * Bank of America London branch * Bank of China London branch * Bank of England * Bank of Scotland * Barclays * BNP Paribas London branch * Citibank London branch * ClearBank Limited * CLS Group International (an Edge Act Bank based in New York) * Clydesdale Bank * Danske Bank * Deutsche Bank London branch * Elavon Financial Services DAC UK branch * Euroclear Bank SA/NV Brussels Head Office * Handelsbanken plc (UK subsidiary of Svenska Handelsbanken AB) * HSBC Bank (Europe) (part of the HSBC Group) * ING Group Amsterdam Head Office * Ipagoo LLP * JPMorgan Chase London branch * LCH Limited * Lloyds Bank * National Westminster Bank * Northern Trust London branch * Royal Bank of Scotland * Santander UK * Société Générale (Paris Head Office) * Standard Chartered Bank * State Street Bank and Trust Company London branch * The Bank of New York Mellon London branch * The Co-operative Bank * TSB Bank plc * UBS London branch * Virgin Money CHAPS clearing information relating to UK banks may be found in the Industry Sorting Code Directory. ==See also== * CHIPS, the US equivalent of CHAPS ==External links== *https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/payment-and-settlement/chaps *CHAPS page on the Payments Council website *CHAPS LinkedIn Page ==References== Category:Financial services companies of the United Kingdom Category:Payment clearing systems Category:1984 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Banking in the United Kingdom ","title":"CHAPS"},{"id":"2235865","text":"Herbert Grahame Beresford (November 19, 1880 – June 15, 1938) was a land surveyor and politician in Manitoba, Canada.

While current sources or sinks are abstract elements used for analysis, generally they have physical counterparts in real-world applications; e.g. the anode or cathode in a battery. In all cases, each of the opposing terms (source or sink) may refer to the same object, depending on the perspective of the observer and the sign convention being used; there is no intrinsic difference between a source and a sink. In some cases, the term current source refers to a boundary where charge flows from locations where it is not measured to locations where it is measured. In a similar fashion, a current sink may refer to the boundary where charge flows from locations where it is measured to locations where it is not measured. By analogy to the flow of water, a current source would be like a mountain spring - water flows from its source (a hidden location underground) to the surface where it is easily observed. Using the same analogy, a current sink would be like water flowing down a drain - water travels from where it is observed to where it is not observed. Two-compartment model illustrating the definition of a current sink vs source. Shown at right is a general two-compartment model to help illustrate the definition of current sources or sinks. In this two-compartment model, the compartments are separated by a semi-conductive barrier (gray). An observer, symbolized by the eye, can \\"see\\" only one compartment at a time. Red arrows indicate the direction of flow of positive charges, while black arrows indicate the direction of flow of negative charges. The pink and green backgrounds are meant to symbolize different configurations, configuration 1 when charges are flowing in one direction and configuration 2 when they are flowing in the opposite direction. The difference between the left and right panels is simply the location of the \\"eye\\". A source or a sink is defined by which compartment is viewable by the observer. * A source is: ** A flow of positive charges from the \\"invisible\\" to the \\"visible\\" compartment (i.e. toward the eye), or… ** A flow of negative charges from the \\"visible\\" to the \\"invisible\\" (away from the eye). * A sink is: ** A flow of positive charges \\"away from the eye\\", or… ** A flow of negative charges \\"toward the eye\\". In biology, the schematic barrier in the figure could represent a cell membrane, and as a result, the two compartments could represent the inside and the outside of the cell. Generally speaking the point of observation would be outside the cell. Thus the cell would be termed a sink with respect to any flow of positive charges into it, and the cell would act as a source for any positive charges flowing out of it. Note that when considering the flow of negative charges, the definitions are reversed. ==Current sources and sinks in neurobiology== Current sources and sinks have proven to be very valuable in the study of brain function. Both have particular relevance in electrophysiology. Two examples of the study of sources and sinks are Electroencephalography (EEG) and Current Source Density Analysis (extracellular field potentials), but have also shown enhancements in spatio- temporal resolution of EEG. ==Current source density analysis== Current source density analysis (which could more accurately be called current source and sink density analysis) is the practice of placing a microelectrode in proximity to a nerve or a nerve cell to detect current sourcing from, or sinking into, their plasma membranes. When positive charges, for example, flow quickly across a plasma membrane to the inside of a cell (sink) this creates a transient cloud of negativity in the vicinity of the sink. This is because the flow of positive charges into the interior of the cell leaves behind uncompensated negative charges. A nearby micro-electrode with substantial tip resistance (on the order of 1 MΩ) can detect that negativity because a voltage difference will develop across the tip of the electrode (between the negativity outside the electrode, and the electroneutral environment inside the electrode). Put another way, the electrode internal solution will donate some of the positive charge needed to compensate the negativity caused by the current sink. Thus, the inside of the electrode will become negative relative to ground for as long as the extracellular negativity persists. The extracellular negativity will persist as long as the current sink is present. Thus, by measuring a negativity relative to ground, the electrode indirectly reports the presence of a nearby current sink. The size of the recorded negativity will vary directly with the size of the current sink and inversely with the distance between the electrode and the sink. The relationship between the sum of the current sources and sinks and the voltage measured by the microelectrode probe may be calculated analytically if it is assumed that the quasi-static assumption holds, that the medium is spherically symmetric, homogeneous, isotropic, and infinite, and if the current source or sink is modeled as a point source. The relationship is given by: :\\\\Phi(r)={I \\\\over 4 \\\\pi r \\\\sigma} where \\\\Phi is the potential at radius r from the source or sink, which passes current I through a medium with conductivity \\\\sigma. == See also == *Current source *Current mirror == References == Category:Electrical systems Category:Electromagnetism ","title":"Current sources and sinks"},{"id":"2235903","text":"County collecting is keeping track of the counties and other major census divisions one has visited in the United States. Many county collectors try to go for blackout, to visit every county unit in the United States. Others try to black out individual states, and others are only interested in keeping track of the counties they have visited without blacking out any states. County collecting is a way for people to relate to geography and their own life histories. One journalist characterized it as \\"a very organized form of wanderlust.\\" Many county collectors became interested in the pursuit after being given a school assignment to plot their travels on a county-outline map of the United States. Many county collectors document their travels by being photographed with a county sign marker, or by taking a photo of the sign itself. Some document these travels with gas and other receipts. However, the web sites and organized groups that facilitate county collecting do not require a participant to prove his or her entry into a particular county. The Extra Miler Club (EMC) was founded in 1973 by three county completionists who came up with the idea because they had been collecting license plates and noticed in their discussion how many rural counties they had all visited in that pursuit. The club is a non-profit organization that meets annually in conjunction with the Automobile License Plate Collectors Association and recognizes completers (of which there are now more than 60, as of 2019) on its web site. Some avid county collectors visit new counties by taking circuitous routes, for example, driving from Minneapolis to Chicago by way of Green Bay, Wisconsin. The most determined collectors take entire trips which consist of driving around states in cornrow patterns. This is pure county collecting. On the other hand, taking a short detour from a direct route to visit one or more counties is called dipping. There are currently 3,143 counties and county- equivalents in the United States, including the boroughs and census areas of Alaska, the parishes of Louisiana, the independent cities of Baltimore, Maryland, St. Louis, Missouri, Carson City, Nevada, 38 cities in Virginia and Washington, D.C..

In 1925, the United States Secretary of Agriculture appointed him to the Joint Board of Interstate Highways, which was to designate the new federal highways and mark them. One of the routes requested by Congress was a road running from Virginia Beach, Virginia to Los Angeles, California. This road would follow what is now U.S. Highway 60 from Virginia Beach to Springfield, Missouri, continue west to Joplin, across southern Kansas, Colorado, Utah, turning south to Las Vegas, Nevada, then further south and west to Los Angeles. Avery successfully argued that to avoid the high peaks of the Rocky Mountains, the road should turn south through Tulsa and Oklahoma City, continue west across the Texas Panhandle, New Mexico, Arizona, and southern California. His suggestion that this highway should go east from Springfield to St. Louis and Chicago, Illinois, as commerce naturally continued in that direction, was also adopted. After the highways were routed, the group decided not to name the highways (as had been done by many non- profit groups which were currently connecting various state routes into longer multi-state and transcontinental routes), but instead to follow the pattern of numbering the highways, as established in Wisconsin and Missouri. The current east-west routes would be even numbers, and the north-south would be odd. Major routes would be one- or two-digit numbers ending in either \\"1\\" or \\"0\\" depending on the route. To avoid a \\"U.S. 0\\", U.S. Highway 2 was treated as a \\"0\\" highway and U.S. Route 101 would be treated as a two-digit highway to expand the number of available routes north-south. Avery, arguing that the Chicago to Los Angeles route would be a major highway, numbered the highway US 60. This received support from Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, and Missouri. It was outright attacked by a delegation from Kentucky. ===U.S. 60 vs. U.S. 62=== The Virginia Beach–Springfield route had been designated as U.S. 62 and actually terminated south of Ozark, Missouri at U.S. Highway 65. Kentucky would be the only state without a \\"0\\" highway. They countered Avery's US route by pushing for US 60 to run between Virginia Beach and Los Angeles; the Springfield to Chicago section could be \\"U.S. 60 North\\". Avery returned with \\"U.S. 60 South\\" for the Springfield–Virginia Beach alignment. Kentucky threatened to walk completely out of the new highway system (individual states could not be forced to participate in it). Finally, Kentucky offered a compromise: connect their highway with Avery's in Springfield and give their highway the number 60. Avery could have his Chicago–Los Angeles highway if he would accept the number 62 which was originally assigned to their road. Avery disliked the number 62, found out 66 was not used, and designated the Chicago–Los Angeles highway as U.S. 66. In 1926, the Federal Highway System was approved by Congress. With this done, Congress also de-certified all the old \\"association\\" highways. ===Avery and the U.S. 66 Association=== In 1927, Avery pushed for the creation of the U.S. Highway 66 Association to promote paving U.S. 66 and promote travel on the highway. He was elected Vice President in 1929. He got a business connection in Springfield, Missouri appointed as president. In the 1930s, Avery would attempt to have himself elected president of the organization, but he never succeeded. ==Death== Essie Avery died in October 1962. Cyrus Avery died in Los Angeles, California on July 2, 1963, and was buried in Rose Hill Cemetery in Tulsa.\\"Find a grave: Cyrus Stevens Avery.\\"Retrieved July 24, 2011. Avery Drive, a street in southwest Tulsa, was named for him. ==Honors== In 1997, the National Historic Route 66 Federation established a Cyrus Avery Award, which has been presented variously to individuals for outstanding creativity in depicting Route 66, and to organizations for noteworthy preservation projects. In 2004, the City of Tulsa, Oklahoma renamed the Eleventh Street Bridge (which carried US 66 over the Arkansas River), the Cyrus Avery Route 66 Memorial Bridge in his honor. In late 2012, artist Robert Summers unveiled \\"East Meets West\\", a sculpture in Cyrus Avery Centennial Plaza at Southwest Boulevard at Riverside Drive in Tulsa. The detailed 135%-scale bronze depicts Avery stopping his Ford on the 11th Street Bridge as the vehicle frightened two horses pulling a wagon laden with oil barrels. ==Notes== ==ReferencesEncyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture – Avery, Cyrus * *National Historic Route 66 Federation *Cyrus Avery Collection at Oklahoma State University Category:U.S. Route 66 Category:People from Bradford County, Pennsylvania Category:Businesspeople from Tulsa, Oklahoma Category:1871 births Category:1963 deaths ","title":"Cyrus Avery"},{"id":"2235932","text":"Mount Michener, with a peak, is a mountain on the eastern border of the Canadian Rockies in Alberta, Canada. It forms the northerly part of the Ram Range. The mountain sits on the shore of Abraham Lake and its north, west and south face are all visible from the David Thompson Highway. The mountain was named in 1982 after Daniel Roland Michener who was the Governor General of Canada from 1967 - 1974. Its previous names were Eye Opener Mountain and Phoebe's Teat, reportedly after a woman from Rocky Mountain House who would periodically visit the Nordegg miners in the 1930s. ==Geography== NTS Topographic Map showing Mount Michener The formation of the Rocky Mountains began in the Late Cretaceous Period and finished in the Early Tertiary Period. The pressure on the fault line caused thousands of metres of rock to thrust upward. The contorted beds near the summit of Mount Michener are visible evidence of the tremendous force that caused its formation. A system of limestone caves does exist within the mountain, but they remain undocumented. ==Footnotes== Michener ","title":"Mount Michener"},{"id":"2235942","text":"Abdel Ahad Gamal El-Din is an Egyptian academic and politician. ==Career== He is a member of the Pan-African Parliament from Egypt.

The festival is held in Notodden, Norway, usually in early August. It has been running annually since 1988. The festival does not aim to be the biggest of its type, but to become Europe's \\"largest blues experience\\", which is reflected in their emphasis on quality over quantity. ==History== Margit Bakken at Notodden Blues Festival in 2013. With Rita Engedalen, she forms the duo Women in Blues, one of the most established blues ensembles in Scandinavia In 1988, thirteen local blues enthusiasts gave their personal guarantee to the bank and were granted a cash credit, and the first Notodden Blues Festival took place. The credit from the bank turned out to be unnecessary, and the festival soon became one of Norway's most popular music festivals. Today, the Notodden Blues Festival is the largest \\"pure\\" blues festival in Scandinavia, expanding from 2,000 sold tickets (NOK 200,000 gross ticket sales) to 24,500 sold tickets (NOK 12,000,000 gross ticket sales) in 17 years. ==Organization== NBF is an ideal organization, where the General Assembly is the highest authority. Every year, the General Assembly elects a new board, consisting of one leader and six board members. The General Assembly provides the guidelines and financial frames wherein the Board can operate. In 1992, NBF established the Notodden Blues Festival Foundation. The goal of this entity is to secure the financial costs needed to operate the festival. Presently, the \\"operation capital \\" controlled by the Foundation is NOK 900,000, which has been accumulated as a result of the economic success of previous festivals. ==Youth seminars == Each year, young people between the ages of 14 and 18 are given the opportunity to be a part of the \\"New Generation of the Blues\\". Forty youths are chosen to participate in this seminar. Participants, though mostly from Norway, come from as far away as Mississippi, U.S.A. Professional instructors, with backgrounds ranging from studio, touring and television, guide the seminar's students through \\"one on one\\", as well as group classes. The seminar includes the disciplines of harmony, playing by ear, instrument/equipment maintenance and the \\"music business\\". The seminar is held over six days, starting on the Monday before the festival opening. During the course, each student is given the opportunity to work in the studio and a \\"studio quality\\" CD is produced afterwards for each of the participants. The seminar closes on Saturday with a concert performed by the seminar members. This concert is a part of the festival program and is attended by an audience of thousands. ==List of artists1980s=== 1988 *Howlin’ Wilf And The Vee Jays (UK) *The Balham Alligators (UK) *Barry Cuda (USA) *Tom Principato (USA) *Good Time Charlie (N) *Notodden Blues Band (N) *The R&B; Express (N) 1989 *Lazy Lester (USA) *Chris Cain (USA) *Mannish Boys (USA) *Ford Blues Band (USA) *Roy Book Binder (USA) *Smalltown Blyes Band (DK) *Hungry John & The Blue Shadows (N) *Notodden Blues Band (N) *Steinar Albrigtsen (N) *The R&B; Express (N) *Two For The Blues (N) *Malvina (N) *Kåre Virud (N) *Just Married (N) *Jaybirds (N) *Blåmenn (N) ===1990s=== 1990 *Joe Louis Walker & The Boss Talkers (USA) *Katie Webster (USA) *Lowell Fulson (USA) *Charlie Musselwhite (USA) *Diamond Teeth Mary (USA) *Big Town Playboys (UK) *Robert Kyle (USA) *Alan Haynes (USA) *Lynwood Slim Band (USA) *Rock Bottom & The Cutaways (USA) *Reidar Larsen (N) *Barfly Squatters (N) *Solid Slim With Solid Support (N) *The R&B; Express (N) *Sanni's Kæmpingvogn (N) *Florrie & Nattergalene (N) *Mulens Portland Combo (N) *Jigsaw Puzzle (N) *Notodden Blues Band (N) *Just Married (N) *Tom & The Tom Toms (N) 1991 *Jimmy Witherspoon & Robben Ford (USA) *Lonnie Brooks Band (USA) *Earl King (USA) *Jimmy Rogers & Bob Margolin Band (USA) *Stan Webb's Chicken Shack (UK) *Chris Cain Band (USA) *Bobby Mack & Night Train (USA) *Barry Cuda (USA) *Pelle Lindström & Blow Your Blues (S) *Ba Ba Blues (S) *Shades Of Blue (DK) *Chicago Blues Meeting (N) *The Boys In The Band (N) *Sugar Daddies (N) *Corny Horns (N) *Sizz & The Blue Bag (N) *Just Married Band (N) *The R&B; Express (N) *Notodden Blues Band (N) 1992 *Junior Wells (USA) *Charles Brown (USA) *Koko Taylor (USA) *The Five Blind Boys Of Alabama (USA) *Lou Ann Barton (USA) *James Harman Band (USA) *The Smokin’ Joe Kubek Band (USA) *Debbie Davies Band (USA) *King Pleasure And The Biscuit Boys (UK) *Little Charlie & The Nightcats (USA) *Mick Abrahams’ Blodwyn Pig (UK) *The Down Home Cooking Blues Band (S) *Nightcats (S) *Göran Wennerbrandt (S) *Notodden Blues Band (N) *Barfly Squatters (N) *Kåre Virud (N) *Toini & The Tomcats (N) *Boye's Combo (N) *Blæster (N) *Wentzel (N) *Vidar Busk & The Bushmen (N) *Oddvar Solheim & The Hard Luck Blues Band (N) *Broke’n’Proud (N) *The R&B; Express (N) *Just Married Band (N) 1993 *Clarence Gatemouth Brown (USA) *Rod Piazza & The Mighty Flyers (USA) *Duke Robillard Band (USA) *Kenny Neal (USA) *C.J.

He was well known for his \\"grandiose monuments\\".Rhodes, Anthony, ‘’Propaganda: The Art of Persuasion: World War II’’ Chelsea House Publishers, New York, 1976 , p. 28 ==Life and career== Thorak's reputation was established in 1922 when he created Der sterbende Krieger (The Dying Warrior), a statue memorializing the dead of World War I in Stolpmünde. In 1933, Thorak joined Arno Breker as one of the two \\"official sculptors\\" of the Third Reich.\\"Art: Bigger Than Life\\" In his government-approved studio outside Munich, Thorak worked on statues intended to represent the folk-life of Germany under Nazi leadership; these works tended to be heroic in scale, up to 20 metres (65 feet) in height.

His work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

Cryo-EM is gaining popularity in structural biology. The utility of transmission electron cryomicroscopy stems from the fact that it allows the observation of specimens that have not been stained or fixed in any way, showing them in their native environment. This is in contrast to X-ray crystallography, which requires crystallizing the specimen, which can be difficult, and placing them in non-physiological environments, which can occasionally lead to functionally irrelevant conformational changes. Advances in electron detector technology, particularly DDE (Direct Electron Detectors) as well as more powerful software imaging algorithms have allowed for the determination of macromolecular structures at near-atomic resolution. Imaged macromolecules include viruses, ribosomes, mitochondria, ion channels, and enzyme complexes. Starting in 2018, cryo-EM could applied to structures as small as hemoglobin (64 kDa) and with resolutions up to 1.8 Å. In 2019, cryo-EM structures represented 2.5% of structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank,, and this number continues to grow. An application of cryo-EM is cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), where a 3D reconstruction of the sample is created from tilted 2D images. == Development == The original rationale for CryoTEM was as a means to fight radiation damage for biological specimens. The amount of radiation required to collect an image of a specimen in the electron microscope is high enough to be a potential source of specimen damage for delicate structures. In addition, the high vacuum required on the column of an electron microscope makes the environment for the sample quite harsh. The problem of the vacuum was partially solved by the introduction of negative stains but even with negative stains biological samples are prone to structural collapse upon dehydration of the specimen. Embedding the samples in ice below the sublimation temperature was a possibility that was contemplated early on, but water tends to arrange into a crystalline lattice of lower density upon freezing and this can destroy the structure of anything that is embedded in it. In the early 1980s, several groups studying solid state physics were attempting to produce vitreous ice by different means, such as high pressure freezing or flash freezing. In a seminal paper in 1984, the group led by Jacques Dubochet at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory showed images of adenovirus embedded in a vitrified layer of water. This paper is generally considered to mark the origin of Cryo-EM, and the technique has been developed to the point of becoming routine at numerous laboratories throughout the world. The energy of the electrons used for imaging (80–300 kV) is high enough that covalent bonds can be broken. When imaging specimens are vulnerable to radiation damage, it is necessary to limit the electron exposure used to acquire the image. These low exposures require that the images of thousands or even millions of identical frozen molecules be selected, aligned, and averaged to obtain high- resolution maps, using specialized software. A significant improvement in structural features was achieved in 2012 by the introduction of direct electron detectors and better computational algorithms. In 2015, Bridget Carragher and colleagues at the Scripps National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy used techniques she and Clint Potter developed to determine the first cryo-EM structure with a resolution finer than 3 Å, thereby elevating CryoTEM as a tool comparable to and potentially superior to traditional x-ray crystallography techniques. Since then, higher resolutions have been achieved, including a 2.2 Å structure of bacterial enzyme β-galactosidase in 2015 and a 1.8 Å structure of glutamate dehydrogenase in 2016. Cryo-EM has also been used to determine the structure of various viruses, including the Zika virus, and has been applied to large complexes such as the spliceosome. In 2017, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded jointly to Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson, \\"for developing cryo-electron microscopy for the high-resolution structure determination of biomolecules in solution\\". == Biological specimens  Thin film === The biological material is spread on an electron microscopy grid and is preserved in a frozen-hydrated state by rapid freezing, usually in liquid ethane near liquid nitrogen temperature. By maintaining specimens at liquid nitrogen temperature or colder, they can be introduced into the high- vacuum of the electron microscope column. Most biological specimens are extremely radiosensitive, so they must be imaged with low-dose techniques (usefully, the low temperature of transmission electron cryomicroscopy provides an additional protective factor against radiation damage). Consequently, the images are extremely noisy. For some biological systems it is possible to average images to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and retrieve high-resolution information about the specimen using the technique known as single particle analysis. This approach in general requires that the things being averaged are identical, although some limited conformational heterogeneity can now be studied (e.g. ribosome). Three-dimensional reconstructions from CryoTEM images of protein complexes and viruses have been solved to sub-nanometer or near-atomic resolution, allowing new insights into the structure and biology of these large assemblies. Analysis of ordered arrays of protein, such as 2-D crystals of transmembrane proteins or helical arrays of proteins, also allows a kind of averaging which can provide high- resolution information about the specimen. This technique is called electron crystallography. === Vitreous sections === The thin film method is limited to thin specimens (typically < 500 nm) because the electrons cannot cross thicker samples without multiple scattering events. Thicker specimens can be vitrified by plunge freezing (cryofixation) in ethane (up to tens of μm in thickness) or more commonly by high pressure freezing (up to hundreds of μm). They can then be cut in thin sections (40 to 200 nm thick) with a diamond knife in a cryoultramicrotome at temperatures lower than −135 °C (devitrification temperature). The sections are collected on an electron microscope grid and are imaged in the same manner as specimen vitrified in thin film. This technique is called transmission electron cryomicroscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS) or transmission electron cryomicroscopy of frozen-hydrated sections. == Material specimens == In addition to allowing vitrified biological samples to be imaged, CryoTEM can also be used to image material specimens that are too volatile in vacuum to image using standard, room temperature electron microscopy. For example, vitrified sections of liquid-solid interfaces can be extracted for analysis by CryoTEM, and sulfur, which is prone to sublimation in the vacuum of electron microscopes, can be stabilized and imaged in CryoTEM. == Techniques == A variety of techniques can be used in CryoTEM.Presentation on Cryoelectron Microscopy  PharmaXChange.info Popular techniques include: #Electron crystallography ## Analysis of two-dimensional crystals ## Analysis of helical filaments or tubes ##Microcrystal Electron Diffraction (MicroED) # Single particle analysis (SPA) ##Time-resolved CryoTEM # Electron cryotomography (cryoET) == See also == * Cryogenic scanning electron microscopy * EM Data Bank * Resolution (electron density) * Single particle analysis == References == == Further reading == * * == External links == * * The Fine Structure of a Frozen Virus – Sophisticated single-particle electron cryomicroscopy reveals unprecedented details in a virus's protein coat, Technology Review, March 19, 2008 * Getting Started in Cryo-EM – Online course from Caltech, Professor Grant Jensen * EM Data Bank * EMstats Trends and distributions of maps in EMDB, e.g. resolution trends Category:Cell biology Category:Protein structure Category:Electron microscopy ","title":"Transmission electron cryomicroscopy"},{"id":"2236003","text":"The Apollo 11 plaque on the descent stage of the Lunar Module Eagle on the Moon bears the signatures of Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, Buzz Aldrin, and U.S. President Richard M.

Tomas then has a fling with Andrea and gets caught in the act. After seeing the emptiness of his life, punctuated with him making a scene at a local nightclub, Tomas declares his love for Ana before apparently committing suicide by walking into an elevator shaft. ===Alternate endings=== In the Region 4 DVD version, several alternate final scenes are explored, including Tomas surviving the fall and emerging in a full body cast. ==Cast== * Demián Bichir as Tomás * Susana Zabaleta as Ana * Jorge Salinas as Miguel * Cecilia Suárez as Andrea * Víctor Huggo Martin as Carlos * Mónica Dionne as María ==Awards== * Silver Ariels from the Mexican Academy of Film: ** Best actress: (Susana Zabaleta) ** Art direction: (Brigitte Broch) ** Best original score ** Best original script ** ambientación *Audience Award (XIV Guadalajara Film Festival) ==References*Review on the New York Times site *20 questions to Susana Zabaleta * DVD review * Profile on Zinema.com * Sexo, pudor y lágrimas on the Mexican cinema site of ITESM Category:1999 plays Category:1999 films Category:1999 comedy films Category:Mexican films Category:Mexican plays Category:Spanish-language films Category:Estudios Churubusco films ","title":"Sexo, pudor y lágrimas"},{"id":"2236015","text":"The North Pacific Current. The North Pacific Current (sometimes referred to as the North Pacific Drift) is a slow warm water current that flows west-to-east between 30 and 50 degrees north in the Pacific Ocean. The current forms the southern part of the North Pacific Subpolar Gyre and the northern part of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. The North Pacific Current is formed by the collision of the Kuroshio Current, running northward off the coast of Japan, and the Oyashio Current, which is a cold subarctic current that flows south and circulates counterclockwise along the western North Pacific Ocean. In the eastern North Pacific off southern British Columbia, it splits into the southward flowing California Current and the northward flowing Alaska Current. ==Flows and temperature== Originating from the eastward directed flow occurring east of the island of Honshu, Japan, the North Pacific Current extends over 40° of longitude. According to the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, the NPC may be considered to be a part or an extension of the Kuroshio current. The current covers a large area and transports warmer water from the subtropics to the sub-polar latitudes. Average sea surface temperature along the NPC can range in the winter from 45-61°F (7.2-16.1°C) and in the summer months 64°F-74°F (17.8-23.3°C). As it flows from west to east, the latitudinal extent of the NPC increases such that it spans some 20 degrees of latitude east of the dateline. This is associated with a decrease in the speed of current; eastward directed speeds at the surface are typically less than 0.05 m/s (5 cm/s) in the central Pacific. As the NPC approaches the west coast of North America, it divides into two broad currents: the northward flowing Alaska Current and the southward flowing California Current. This splitting of flow is referred to as the bifurcation of the NPC. The Gulf of Alaska and the California Current receive different volumes and flows of warm water from the North Pacific Current. The Gulf of Alaska receives about 60% of the flow of the NPC while the California Current receives the remaining 40%. These values may fluctuate, resulting in changes in the volume and the speed of the NPC water entering into the Alaska and California Currents. ==Gyre contribution== The NPC forms the northward portion of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. As the eastward extension of the Kuroshio, the flow of the NPC can lead to the transport of material from the western Pacific to the coast of North America. For example, some of the marine debris from the Japanese earthquake and tsunami of 2011 was transported by the NPC across the Pacific, leading to deposition of tsunami debris along the shores of Alaska, British Columbia, Washington and Oregon. ==References== * The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition (1970-1979) * H.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba on four occasions between 1900 and 1932. Bernier was a member of the Conservative Party, and served as a cabinet minister in the government of Rodmond Roblin. His father, Thomas A. Bernier, was a member of the Senate of Canada. Bernier was born in St. Jean d'Iberville, Québec, and educated at St. Boniface College and the Manitoba University. He received a Master of Arts degree. Bernier was called to the Manitoba bar in 1896 and began practising as a barrister-at-law in Winnipeg in 1897. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in a by- election held on November 24, 1900, defeating Victor Mager by 154 votes in the St. Boniface constituency. He lost his seat in the 1903 provincial election, losing to Liberal Horace Chevrier by a single vote. Bernier was re-elected to the legislature in the 1907 election, defeating Chevrier by 71 votes. Returned without difficulty in the 1910 campaign, he was appointed to cabinet on May 22, 1913 as Provincial Secretary. Bernier was again re-elected in the 1914 provincial election. Early in 1915, the entire Roblin administration was forced to resign after the Lieutenant Governor issued a report which found the government had been guilty of corrupt practices in the tendering of contracts for new legislative buildings. Bernier did not seek re-election in the 1915 campaign, and the St. Boniface constituency was won by Liberal Joseph Dumas. Bernier returned to the legislature for a third time in the 1920 provincial election, defeating Dumas and three other candidates. He identified himself as an independent during this period, but was still widely regarded as being in sympathy with the Conservative Party. He was again returned in the 1922 campaign, once again identifying himself as an independent. Bernier resigned from the legislature on September 1, 1926 to campaign for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1926 federal election. He ran as a candidate of the Conservative Party of Canada in the federal riding of St. Boniface, and lost to Liberal John Power Howden by 2,668 votes. Bernier ran again for the provincial constituency of St. Boniface in the 1927 provincial election, this time as an official candidate of the Manitoba Conservative Party. This campaign ended in controversy, with a ballot-counting process marred by confusion and error. Liberal candidate L.P. Gagnon was initially declared the winner by one vote, but a recount saw Bernier confirmed as the victor. He returned to the legislature, and rejoined the Conservative caucus on the opposition benches. He was expelled from the legislature for a month in 1928, after being named by the Speaker. Bernier lost his seat for the final time in the 1932 campaign, falling to Labour candidate Harold Lawrence by 504 votes. He actually won a plurality of votes on the first count, but fell behind on transfers (Manitoba used the single transferable ballot for elections during this period). From 1900 to 1917, Bernier was editor for the francophone newspaper Le Manitoba. In 1910, he married Rose Marie Bernier. Bernier was an honorary colonel with the Canadian Expeditionary Force during World War I and helped with recruiting. After leaving politics, he served as a county court judge from 1933 to 1949. Bernier died in hospital in Montreal at the age of 76. == References == ==External links== * Joseph Bernier at the Manitoba Historical Society Category:1874 births Category:1951 deaths Category:Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba MLAs Category:Conservative Party of Canada (1867–1942) candidates in the 1926 Canadian federal election Category:Judges in Manitoba Category:Franco-Manitoban people ","title":"Joseph Bernier"},{"id":"2236023","text":"Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is a rare birth defect in which there is a complete or partial absence of the corpus callosum. It occurs when the development of the corpus callosum, the band of white matter connecting the two hemispheres in the brain, in the embryo is disrupted. The result of this is that the fibers that would otherwise form the corpus callosum are instead longitudinally oriented along the ipsilateral ventricular wall and form structures called Probst bundles. In addition to agenesis, other degrees of callosal defects exist, including hypoplasia (underdevelopment or thinness), hypogenesis (partial agenesis) or dysgenesis (malformation). ACC is found in many syndromes and can often present alongside hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis. When this is the case, there can also be an enlarged fourth ventricle or hydrocephalus; this is called Dandy–Walker malformation. ==Signs and symptoms== MRI images of three patients in the sagittal plane. A and B: Complete agenesis of the corpus callosum. C: Complete agenesis of both the corpus callosum and the anterior commissure. Signs and symptoms of ACC and other callosal disorders vary greatly among individuals. However, some characteristics common in individuals with callosal disorders include vision impairments, low muscle tone (hypotonia), poor motor coordination, delays in motor milestones such as sitting and walking, delayed toilet training and dysautonomic symptoms such as low perception of pain or chewing and swallowing difficulties. Laboratory research has demonstrated that individuals with ACC have difficulty transferring more complex information from one hemisphere to the other. They also have been shown to have some cognitive disabilities (difficulty in complex problem solving) and social difficulties (missing subtle social cues), even when their intelligence quotient is normal. Recent research suggests that specific social difficulties may be a result of impaired face processing. The unusual social behavior in childhood often resembles that of an autism spectrum disorder. Other characteristics sometimes associated with callosal disorders include seizures, spasticity, early feeding difficulties and/or gastric reflux, hearing impairments, abnormal head and facial features, and intellectual disability. === Associated brain anomalies === Brain anomalies that can sometimes occur in syndromes that cause callosal disorders include: * Aplasia of the cerebellar vermis *Chiari malformation *Colpocephaly *Dandy–Walker syndrome *Holoprosencephaly *Hydrocephalus *Neuronal migration disorders such as grey matter heterotopia *Schizencephaly ===Associated syndromes and conditions=== Some syndromes that frequently include ACC are: * Acrocallosal syndrome * Aicardi syndrome * Andermann syndrome * Donnai–Barrow syndrome * Dwarfism * FG syndrome * L1CAM syndrome * Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II * Mowat–Wilson syndrome * Oculocerebrocutaneous syndrome * Saal Bulas syndrome * Septo-optic dysplasia (optic nerve hypoplasia) * Shapiro syndrome * Vici syndrome Some conditions that can sometimes be associated with ACC or other callosal disorders include: *1p36 deletion syndrome *13q deletion syndrome *CDK13-related disorder * Craniofacial abnormalities and other oral and maxillofacial pathologies * Fetal alcohol syndrome *Fetal warfarin syndrome *Genitopatellar syndrome *Gomez-Lopez-Hernandez syndrome *Joubert syndrome * Lujan–Fryns syndrome *Marden–Walker syndrome * Maternal nutritional deficiencies or infections * Metabolic disorders * Okamoto syndrome *Opitz G/BBB syndrome *Pascual-Castroviejo syndrome * Pitt–Hopkins syndrome *Sensenbrenner syndrome *Strømme syndrome * Triploid syndrome *Trisomy 9 * Xia-Gibbs syndrome ==Causes== Agenesis of the corpus callosum is caused by disruption to development of the fetal brain between the 3rd and 12th weeks of pregnancy. In most cases, it is not possible to know what caused an individual to have ACC or another callosal disorder. However, research suggests that some possible causes may include chromosome errors, inherited genetic factors, prenatal infections or injuries, prenatal toxic exposures, structural blockage by cysts or other brain abnormalities and metabolic disorders. ===Ciliopathies: rare genetic disorders=== Until recently, the medical literature did not indicate a connection among many genetic disorders, both genetic syndromes and genetic diseases, that are now being found to be related. As a result of new genetic research, some of these are, in fact, highly related in their root cause despite the widely varying symptoms apparent on clinical examination. Agenesis of the corpus callosum is one such disease, part of an emerging class of diseases called ciliopathies. The underlying cause may be a dysfunctional molecular mechanism in the primary cilia structures of the cell organelles that are present in many cellular types throughout the human body. The cilia defects adversely affect \\"numerous critical developmental signaling pathways\\" essential to cellular development and thus offer a plausible hypothesis for the often multi-symptom nature of a large set of syndromes and diseases. Known ciliopathies include primary ciliary dyskinesia, Bardet–Biedl syndrome, polycystic kidney and liver disease, nephronophthisis, Alström syndrome, Meckel–Gruber syndrome and some forms of retinal degeneration. ===Cocaine and other street drugs=== In utero exposure to cocaine, heroin, amphetamines and phenylpropanolamine can lead to agenesis of corpus callosum. ==Diagnosis== Callosal disorders can be diagnosed through brain imaging studies or during autopsy. They may be diagnosed through an MRI, CT scan, Sonography, prenatal ultrasound, or prenatal MRI. ==Treatment== There are currently no specific medical treatments for callosal disorders, but individuals with ACC and other callosal disorders may benefit from a range of developmental therapies, educational support, and services. It is important to consult with a variety of medical, health, educational, and social work professionals. Such professionals include neurologists, neuropsychologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech and language pathologists, pediatricians, recreation therapists, music therapists, geneticists, social workers, special educators, early childhood intervention specialists, and caregivers for adults. ==Prognosis== Prognosis varies depending on the type of callosal abnormality and associated conditions or syndromes. It is not possible for the corpus callosum to regenerate. Neuropsychological testing reveals subtle differences in higher cortical function compared to individuals of the same age and education without ACC, although some individuals with callosal disorders have average intelligence and live normal lives. ==Notable cases== Kim Peek, inspiration for the film Rain Man and renowned for his savant abilities, was born with agenesis of the corpus callosum, along with macrocephaly and damage to the cerebellum. ==Notes== == External links == Category:Congenital disorders of nervous system Category:Corpus callosum ","title":"Agenesis of the corpus callosum"},{"id":"2236026","text":"Fritos corn chips Corn chips are a snack food made from cornmeal fried in oil or baked, usually in the shape of a small noodle or scoop. Corn chips are thick, rigid and very crunchy. Corn chips have the strong aroma and flavor of roasted corn, and are often heavily seasoned with salt. In the US, Fritos is one of the oldest and most widely recognized brands of corn chips. While corn chips and tortilla chips are both made from corn, the corn in tortilla chips is subjected to the nixtamalization process, resulting in a milder flavor and aroma, and a less rigid texture. Tortilla chips also tend to be larger, thinner, and less salty than corn chips. Corn chips are usually eaten alone or with a chip dip. They are a common ingredient in homemade and commercial party mix. In the Southwestern US, a popular dish, Frito pie, is made with corn chips and chili.

The album was produced by Laurie Latham; the sessions took place in Germany, Belgium, London and Liverpool, following an aborted attempt at recording the tracks without de Freitas and with producer Gil Norton. With Latham being an exacting producer, and singer Ian McCulloch receiving star treatment and drinking heavily, the recording was more difficult than the band had initially hoped. The album made more use of keyboards than their previous albums, which had been string-heavy. Three singles were issued: \\"The Game\\", \\"Lips Like Sugar\\" and \\"Bedbugs and Ballyhoo\\". Although Echo & the Bunnymen was successful in the United Kingdom and, to a lesser degree, the United States, it received mixed reviews from the music press following its release in July 1987. The album reached number four on the UK Albums Chart and has been certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry. In North America, it reached number 51 on the United States Billboard 200 and number 51 on the Canadian RPM 100 Albums. In Europe, it stayed in the European Albums Chart for eight weeks, peaking at number 36 on its fourth week. ==Background== Echo & the Bunnymen took time off from touring, writing and recording after the release of the critically acclaimed Ocean Rain in 1984, because the band's manager, the fabled prankster Bill Drummond,Sandall, Robert (20 August 2008). \\"Bill Drummond: pop's prankster heads for destruction\\". The Daily Telegraph. Retrieved 14 January 2009 felt that a year off would help the band write different kinds of songs in preparation for the next album.Adams, pp. 160–1 During the time off, drummer Pete de Freitas travelled through Spain and France on his motorcycle, bass guitarist Les Pattinson worked on his new boat, and singer Ian McCulloch released a solo single \\"September Song\\",Adams, p. 159 leaving guitarist Will Sergeant as the only band member to spend the time doing nothing. Even though the band enjoyed an excellent and creative working relation with Drummond, by the end of 1984 they had mutually parted company as the band were not making enough money.Adams, p. 162 Under the new management of Mick Hancock, Duran Duran's tour manager, the band returned to work in May 1985 with a tour of Scandinavia. They also made a headline appearance at the Glastonbury Festival on 21 June 1985, when they played live for the first time two new songs that would later be included on the album—\\"Satellite\\" and \\"All in Your Mind\\".Adams, p. 170 Now ready to start recording, they entered the studio with Clive Langer and their former producer Ian Broudie to record the songs they had played at Glastonbury, as well as \\"Like a Rollercoaster\\" and \\"Jimmy Brown\\". Not liking the results of this session, the band considered Eddy Grant and ABBA's production team before settling on Laurie Latham as their producer. McCulloch had been impressed by the sharp quality of Latham's production on The Stranglers' single \\"Skin Deep\\".Adams, p. 171 The band met with Latham in Brussels and recorded \\"All in Your Mind\\", \\"Like a Rollercoaster\\" and \\"Jimmy Brown\\", which was renamed \\"Bring on the Dancing Horses\\". \\"Bring on the Dancing Horses\\" appeared on the WEA compilation album Songs to Learn & Sing in November 1985, and was released as a single in the same month. An early version of \\"Bedbugs and Ballyhoo\\", a song that would appear on the album, appeared on the B-side to the 12-inch version. On 31 December 1985, de Freitas went to New Orleans with the road crew on a drug binge and there announced his resignation from the band.Adams, pp. 178–180 Hence, the band faced 1986 with a commitment to record an album, but without their drummer—a musician who was considered fundamental to the band's creative success.Taylor, Steve. 2006. A to X of Alternative Music. London: Continuum International Publishing Group. p. 98. . They hired former Haircut One Hundred drummer Blair Cunningham for the spring 1986 tour of the United States; however, he didn't fit in, and after the tour left to join The Pretenders.Adams, p. 182 The band then hired former ABC drummer David Palmer, and recorded a few sessions with producer Gil Norton for the new album. However, Palmer decided by July 1986 that he did not want to remain with the band. As he left the band, de Freitas returned to the United Kingdom and expressed a wish to rejoin. Uncertain of de Freitas's commitment to the band, and his fragile mental state, they took him back as a hired hand rather than a full member. Now with the line-up that would record Echo & the Bunnymen, the band gave a live television appearance for the BBC in September 1986 when they played two new songs, \\"The Game\\" and \\"Lips Like Sugar\\". According to Will Sergeant, the band were under pressure from Warner Music chairman Rob Dickins to produce an album that would replicate the success of Peter Gabriel's recent number one album So: \\"I couldn't believe it when Rob Dickins brought us into his office and played us Peter Gabriel's album: 'I want you to sound like this!' I think he escaped with his life that day.\\" ==Recording, production and music== Recording of the tracks that were to appear on Echo & the Bunnymen began at Conny Plank's studio in Cologne. Both Echo & the Bunnymen and their label, WEA Records, were unhappy with the results of the Norton sessions with Palmer playing drums.Adams, pp. 182–183 Keen to record again with de Freitas, the band decided to scrap the Norton sessions and to start recording a new album with Latham who had previously worked with the band on their 1985 single \\"Bring on the Dancing Horses\\". The sessions moved from Cologne to ICP Studios in Brussels before returning to Cologne and finishing off at The Workhouse in London and Amazon Studios in Liverpool.Adams, p. 183 The band hoped that the album would be a collection of simple songs; however, Latham was very specific and exacting, and he would work on one song for as long as a month. Recording was also complicated by the star treatment received by McCulloch. This, along with his heavy drinking, alienated him from the rest of the band. In a 1995 interview, band guitarist Will Sergeant said of McCulloch's treatment, \\"We just found it all ridiculous. He had people running around behind him, basically wiping his arse.\\" McCulloch later said in a 1997 interview: \\"I knew I was losing it. I was on another planet but then I didn't want to be on the one [the other Bunnymen] were on.\\" While making the album, the band recorded a version of the Doors' 1967 single \\"People Are Strange\\" for the soundtrack of the 1987 film The Lost Boys. Ray Manzarek, former keyboard player with the Doors, was brought in to provide keyboards on the song. While in the studio, he also contributed keyboards to a re-recording of \\"Bedbugs and Ballyhoo\\", which had previously been the B-side of the 12-inch version of \\"Bring on the Dancing Horses\\". Once Echo & the Bunnymen had been recorded the band's management company, Direct Management, decided to have it mixed by Bruce Lampcov in the United States. While the album was mixed, the band was on tour in Brazil and listened to the finished tracks over the phone.Staunton, Terry. \\"Ocean Refrain: Echo and the Bunnymen\\". Record Collector.

Schweigaard at Universitetsplassen by Julius Middelthun Anton Martin Schweigaard (11 April 1808 – 1 February 1870) was a Norwegian educator, jurist, economist and member of the Norwegian Parliament. ==Background== Schweigaard was born at Kragerø in Telemark, Norway. He was one of three children of Jørgen Fredrik Schweigaard (1771–1818) and Johanne Marie Dahll (1785–1818). Both parents died when he was 10 years old and the children were raised by their grandmother. He studied law at the University of Christiania, where he received his degree in 1832. The following year, the Norwegian Parliament gave him a scholarship to study abroad in Germany and France. ==Career== When he returned to Norway, he got a position as a lecturer at the University of Christiania. He was a professor of both jurisprudence and economics during the 1830s and 1840s. In economic theory, he was an extremely influential publicist for economic liberalism, although not a supporter of Laissez-faire economic ideology. He advocated that the state had an important and necessary role to play in economic life. He is widely credited in helping bring about Norway's change to a capitalist economy. In legal theory, Schweigaard was opposed to the German jurisprudence and legal philosophy that had dominated Northern Europe since the Age of Enlightenment, including natural law. He believed that the stark dichotomies of conceptualism were misleading. Schweigaard figures prominently the theory of Nordic legal pragmatism advanced by Sverre Blandhol, along with Anders Sandøe Ørsted and Friedrich Karl von Savigny. From 1842 to 1869, he was a member of the Norwegian Parliament. His strong belief in the country's economic capabilities made him the leading spokesman in Parliament for construction of railways and development of mail and telegraph services. In 1865, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. ==Selected works== * Betragtninger over Retsvidenskabens nærværende Tilstand i Tydskland (1834) * De la philosophie allemande (1835) *Den norske Handelsret (1841) *Den norske administrative Ret (1842) ==Personal life== He was married during 1835 to Caroline Magnine Homann (1814-1870). Their son, Christian Homann Schweigaard, became Prime Minister of Norway in 1884. Schweigaard and his wife both died during 1870. Both were buried at Vår Frelsers gravlund in Christiania (now Oslo). ==References== Category:1808 births Category:1870 deaths Category:Norwegian jurists Category:19th-century Norwegian politicians Category:Academics of the Faculty of Law, University of Oslo Category:Members of the Storting Category:Norwegian newspaper editors Category:Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences Category:19th-century journalists Category:Male journalists Category:19th-century Norwegian writers Category:19th-century Norwegian male writers ","title":"Anton Martin Schweigaard"},{"id":"2236061","text":"Green Cross may refer to: == Businesses == * Green Cross (South Korea), a Korean pharmaceutical company * Green Cross (Japan), a Japanese pharmaceutical company * Green Cross (chemical warfare), a group of World War I chemical warfare agents == Health and safety == * Green Cross Code, a traffic safety education program in the United Kingdom * Green Cross Corps, an alternative name for the British Women's Reserve Ambulance Corps * Green Cross flags, the industrial safety/health flags in Japan * Green Cross for Safety Award from the National Safety Council * Green Cross International, an environmental organization founded by Mikhail Gorbachev * , a Venezuelan paramedic group == Sports == * C.A.

Because their bones are weaker, people with osteopenia may have a higher risk of fractures, and some people may go on to develop osteoporosis. In 2010, 43 million older adults in the US had osteopenia. There is no single cause for osteopenia, although there are several risk factors, including modifiable (behavioral, including dietary and use of certain drugs) and non-modifiable (for instance, loss of bone mass with age). For people with risk factors, screening via a DXA scanner may help to detect the development and progression of low bone density. Prevention of low bone density may begin early in life and includes a healthy diet and weight-bearing exercise, as well as avoidance of tobacco and alcohol. The treatment of osteopenia is controversial: non-pharmaceutical treatment involves preserving existing bone mass via healthy behaviors (dietary modification, weight-bearing exercise, avoidance or cessation of smoking or heavy alcohol use). Pharmaceutical treatment for osteopenia, including bisphosphonates and other medications, may be considered in certain cases but is not without risks. Overall, treatment decisions should be guided by considering each patient's constellation of risk factors for fractures. Osteopenia exists on a spectrum of normal to dangerously low bone density (osteoporosis). ==Risk factors == Many divide risk factors for osteopenia into fixed (non-changeable) and modifiable factors. Osteopenia can also be secondary to other diseases. An incomplete list of risk factors:Bone density peaks at 35 and then decreases with age. === Fixed === * Age: bone density peaks at age 35, and then decreases. Bone density loss occurs in both men and women *Ethnicity: European and Asian people have increased risk *Sex: women are at higher risk, particularly those with early menopause *Family history: low bone mass in the family increases risk === Modifiable / behavioral === * Tobacco use * Alcohol use * Inactivity – particularly lack of weight-bearing or resistance activities * Insufficient caloric intake - osteopenia can be connected to female athlete triad syndrome, which occurs in female athletes as a combination of energy deficiency, menstrual irregularities, and low bone mineral density. * Low nutrient diet (particularly calcium, Vitamin D) === Other diseases === * Celiac disease, via poor absorption of calcium and vitamin D * Hyperthyroidism * Anorexia nervosa === Medications === * Steroids * Anticonvulsants == Screening and diagnosis == The ISCD (International Society for Clinical Densitometry) and the National Osteoporosis Foundation recommend that older adults (women over 65 and men over 70) and adults with risk factors for low bone mass, or previous fragility fractures, undergo DXA testing. The DXA (dual X-ray absorptiometry) scan uses a form of X-ray technology, and offers accurate bone mineral density results with low radiation exposure. The United States Preventive Task Force recommends osteoporosis screening for women with increased risk over 65 and states there is insufficient evidence to support screening men. The main purpose of screening is to prevent fractures. Of note, USPSTF screening guidelines are for osteoporosis, not specifically osteopenia.A DXA scanner in use.The National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends use of central (hip and spine) DXA testing for accurate measure of bone density, emphasizing that peripheral or \\"screening\\" scanners should not be used to make clinically meaningful diagnoses, and that peripheral and central DXA scans cannot be compared to each other. DXA scanners can be used to diagnose osteopenia or osteoporosis as well as to measure bone density over time as people age or undergo medical treatment or lifestyle changes. Information from the DXA scanner creates a bone mineral density T-score by comparing a patient's density to the bone density of a healthy young person. Bone density between 1 and 2.5 standard deviations below the reference, or a T-score between −1.0 and −2.5, indicates osteopenia (a T-score greater than or equal to −2.5 indicates osteoporosis). Calculation of the T-score itself may not be standardized. The ISCD recommends using Caucasian women between 20 and 29 years old as the baseline for bone density for ALL patients, but not all facilities follow this recommendation. The ISCD recommends that Z-scores, not T-scores, be used to classify bone density in premenopausal women and men under 50. ==Prevention== Prevention of low bone density can start early in life by maximizing peak bone density. Once a person loses bone density, the loss is usually irreversible, so preventing (greater than normal) bone loss is important. Actions to maximize bone density and stabilize loss include: * Exercise, particularly weight-bearing exercise and resistance exercises *Adequate caloric intake * Sufficient calcium in diet: older adults may have increased calcium needs—of note, medical conditions such as Celiac and hyperthyroidism can affect absorption of calcium *Sufficient Vitamin D in diet *Estrogen replacement * Avoidance of steroid medications * Limit alcohol use and smoking ==Pharmaceutical treatment== The pharmaceutical treatment of osteopenia is controversial and more nuanced than well-supported recommendations for improved nutrition and weight-bearing exercise. The diagnosis of osteopenia in and of itself does not always warrant pharmaceutical treatment. Many people with osteopenia may be advised to follow risk prevention measures (as above). Risk of fracture guides clinical treatment decisions: the World Health Organization (WHO) Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) estimates the probability of hip fracture and the probability of a major osteoporotic fracture (MOF), which could occur in a bone other than the hip. In addition to bone density (T-score), calculation of the FRAX score involves age, body characteristics, health behaviors, and other medical history. As of 2014, The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) recommends pharmaceutical treatment for osteopenic postmenopausal women and men over 50 with FRAX hip fracture probability of _>_ 3% or FRAX MOF probability _>_ 20%. As of 2016, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American College of Endocrinology agree. In 2017, the American College of Physicians recommended that clinicians use individual judgment and knowledge of patients' particular risk factors for fractures, as well as patient preferences, to decide whether to pursue pharmaceutical treatment for women with osteopenia over 65. Pharmaceutical treatment for low bone density includes a range of medications. Commonly used drugs include bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate) - some studies show that decreased fracture risk and increased bone density after bisphosphonate treatment for osteopenia. Other medications include selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (raloxifene; estrogen; calcitonin; and teriparatide). These drugs are not without risks. In this complex landscape, many argue that clinicians must consider a patient's individual risk of fracture, not simply treat those with osteopenia as equally at risk. A 2005 editorial in the Annals of Internal Medicine states \\"The objective of using osteoporosis drugs is to prevent fractures. This can be accomplished only by treating patients who are likely to have a fracture, not by simply treating T-scores.\\" ==History == Osteopenia, from Greek ὀστέον (ostéon), \\"bone\\" and πενία (penía), \\"poverty\\", is a condition of sub-normally mineralized bone, usually the result of a rate of bone lysis that exceeds the rate of bone matrix synthesis. See also osteoporosis. In June 1992, the World Health Organization defined osteopenia. An osteoporosis epidemiologist at the Mayo Clinic who participated in setting the criterion in 1992 said \\"It was just meant to indicate the emergence of a problem\\", and noted that \\"It didn't have any particular diagnostic or therapeutic significance. It was just meant to show a huge group who looked like they might be at risk.\\" == See also == * Bone mineral density * Osteoporosis == References == == External links == Category:Histopathology Category:Medical signs ","title":"Osteopenia"},{"id":"2236111","text":"Yılmaz () is a Turkish word that translates to \\"unshirking\\", \\"unbeatable\\", or \\"brave\\", and is a very common surname and occasional male given name. ==Given name== *Yekta Yılmaz Gül (born 1978), Turkish Greco-Roman wrestler * Yılmaz Arslan (born 1968), Kurdish film director, screenwriter and producer * Yılmaz Büyükerşen (born 1936), Turkish politician * Yılmaz Erdoğan (born 1967), Turkish film director, scenarist, poet and actor * Yılmaz Güney (1937-1984), Turkish film director, scenarist, novelist and actor * Yilmaz Kerimo (born 1963), Swedish politician * Yılmaz Orhan (born 1955), Turkish footballer * Yılmaz Özlem (born 1972), Turkish footballer * Yılmaz Vural (born 1953), Turkish football coach ==Surname== * Alper Yılmaz (born 1975), Turkish basketball player * Atıf Yılmaz (1925–2006), Turkish film director, screenwriter and film producer * Aydın Yılmaz (born 1988), Turkish footballer * Ayfer Yılmaz (born 1956), Turkish female civil servant, politician and former government minister * Betül Yılmaz (born 1988), Turkish female handball player * Betül Nur Yılmaz, Turkish football referee * Burak Yılmaz (born 1985), Turkish footballer * Cem Yılmaz (born 1973), Turkish stand-up comedian, actor, cartoonist and screenwriter * Cem Yılmaz (rower) (born 1982), Turkish Olympian rower * Cevdet Yılmaz (born 1967), Turkish politician * Deniz Yılmaz (born 1988), Turkish footballer * Dilek Akagün Yılmaz (born 1963), Turkish politician * Durmuş Yılmaz (born 1947), Turkish economist * Duygu Yılmaz (born 1988), Turkish women's footballer * Fatih Yılmaz (born 1989), Turkish footballer * Gözde Yılmaz (born 1991), Turkish female volleyball player * Gülümser Yılmaz (born 1956), Turkish female chess player * Hakan Yılmaz (born 1982), Turkish weightlifter * İbrahim Yılmaz (born 1994), Turkish footballer * Kübra Yılmaz (born 1991), Turkish female handball player * Mahmut Yılmaz (born 1979), German footballer * Mehmet Yılmaz (born 1988), Turkish footballer * Mehmet Yılmaz (born 1979), Turkish footballer * Mesut Yılmaz (born 1947), Turkish politician * Mustafa Yılmaz (chess player) (born 1992), Turkish Grand Master of chess * Neşe Zara Yılmaz (born 1976), Turkish female singer * Nevriye Yılmaz (born 1980), Turkish female basketball player * Oğuz Yılmaz (born 1968), Turkish musician * Okan Yılmaz (born 1978), Turkish footballer * Özgür Yılmaz (born 1986), Turkish footballer * Özgür Yılmaz (born 1977), Turkish judoka * Pamuk Güllü Yılmaz (born 1993), Turkish women's footballer * Serra Yılmaz (born 1954), Turkish actress * Tayfur Emre Yılmaz (born 1989), Turkish footballer * Tutya Yılmaz (born 1999), Turkish female artistic gymnast * Yağız Yılmaz (born 1993), Turkish archer * Yaşar Yılmaz, Turkish wrestler * Yeliz Yılmaz (born 1980), Turkish female handball player * Yusuf Yılmaz (born 1991), Turkish footballer ==See also== * Yilmaz theory of gravitation * Binatlı Yılmaz S.K.

Ron Hubbard is a posthumous biography of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard by British journalist Russell Miller. First published in the United Kingdom on 26 October 1987, the book takes a critical perspective, challenging the Church of Scientology's account of Hubbard's life and work. It quotes extensively from official documents acquired using the Freedom of Information Act and from Hubbard's personal papers, which were obtained via a defector from Scientology. It was also published in Australia, Canada and the United States. The Church of Scientology strongly opposed the book's publication. The organization was accused of organising a smear and harassment campaign against Miller and his publisher, though it strenuously denied this accusation, and a private investigator involved in the campaign denied that the organization was his client. However, a leak of internal Scientology documents to the press in 1990 disclosed many details of the campaign. The organization and related corporate entities attempted to prevent the book's publication in court, resulting in cases that reached the Supreme Court of the United States, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales and the Federal Court of Canada. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision to let a lower court's ruling stand, denying fair use protection for the book's use of unpublished sources, set a precedent favouring copyright protection of unpublished material over biographers' freedom of speech. Courts in the UK and Canada took an opposite view, allowing publication of Bare-faced Messiah in the public interest. Reviews of the book have been broadly positive — one calling it \\"the best and most comprehensive biography of L. Ron Hubbard\\" — and praise the quality and depth of Miller's research. The Scientology organization has been less complimentary; the executor of Hubbard's estate called it \\"a scumbag book ... full of bullshit\\" in a court deposition in the U.S. == Background and synopsis == Miller traced Hubbard to the vicinity of San Luis Obispo, California, where the Scientology leader was living secretly on this ranch, but Hubbard died before Miller could finish his research. Russell Miller had been an investigative journalist for the Sunday Times and had written well-received biographies of Hugh Hefner (Bunny, published in 1984) and J. Paul Getty (The House of Getty, 1985). These were the first two biographies of a trilogy on sex, money and religion, with the Hubbard book completing the trilogy. He spent two years researching the book, which followed a Sunday Times Magazine investigation of the Church of Scientology published in October 1984. In 1985, he suggested that the Sunday Times should try to find Hubbard, who had disappeared from public view several years earlier. If the project succeeded, it would be a worldwide scoop for the newspaper. Even if it did not find the reclusive Scientology leader, the continuing mystery would itself be a good story. Through contacts among ex- Scientologists in the U.S., Miller narrowed down the area where Hubbard was hiding to the vicinity of San Luis Obispo, California. However, Hubbard died in January 1986 before Miller could finish his project. He decided at this point to use his research as the basis of a full-fledged biography of Hubbard, in addition to writing the previously agreed series of articles for the Sunday Times. Bare-faced Messiah covers a period from 1911, when Hubbard was born, to his death in 1986, with some additional background on his family history. It describes his early life, his success as a science fiction writer in the 1930s and 1940s, his military career during the Second World War, the rise of Dianetics and Scientology in the 1950s, his journeys at sea with his followers in the 1960s and early 1970s and his legal problems and period as a recluse from the mid-1970s to 1986. The author draws on previously unpublished materials, such as Hubbard's teenage diaries and personal correspondence to colleagues, employers and the FBI, as well as government documents like Hubbard's military service record and FBI file. In an \\"author's note\\", Miller writes that the book would have been impossible without the Freedom of Information Act. Among the private papers quoted in the book are a letter written by Hubbard to the FBI denouncing his wife as a Soviet spy, another in which he tells his daughter Alexis that he is not really her father and an internal letter in which he suggests that Scientology should pursue religious status for business reasons. Other sources used by Miller include news articles and comments from interviews that he conducted with Hubbard's old acquaintances and family members. Miller's research was assisted by a set of Hubbard's personal papers obtained by Gerry Armstrong, a disaffected former employee of the Church of Scientology. Armstrong had been preparing material for an official biography of Hubbard, but left the Scientology organization in 1981 after finding that Hubbard's claims about his life conflicted with independent sources. The Church of Scientology obtained an injunction in California to prevent Armstrong from further distributing the documents. However, English courts refused to enforce this order. In the book's preface, Miller summarizes his view of Hubbard: The book contrasts Hubbard's boasts with Miller's research. For example, Chapter 6, which is entitled \\"The Hero Who Never Was\\", begins by quoting the official church biography: \\"Commissioned before the war in 1941 by the US Navy ... serving in all five theaters of World War II and receiving 21 medals and palms ...\\" And it ends by countering: > If his own account of his war experiences is to be believed, he certainly > deserved the twenty-one medals and palms he was said to have received. > Unfortunately, his US Navy record indicates he was awarded just four routine > medals -- the American Defense Service Medal, awarded to everyone serving at > the time of Pearl Harbor, the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific > Campaign Medal and the World War Two Victory Medal, this last received by > everyone serving on V-J Day. For more detail on the debate surrounding Hubbard's military career, see the main article. == Reaction from Hubbard's followers  Harassment of the author and publishers === L. Ron Hubbard, the subject of Bare-faced Messiah. The Church of Scientology refused all cooperation with Miller and sought to obstruct his research. He wrote in his \\"author's note\\" at the start of the book: Miller had been warned before he began his work that he would face difficulties, but was unprepared for the level of harassment that he endured. While researching the book in the U.S., he was spied upon and was constantly followed. His friends and business associates also received hostile visits from Scientologists and private detectives trying to find \\"dirt\\" on him. In October 1987, Miller commented: \\"There are teams of private detectives in the U.S. and this country questioning my friends and trying to discredit me.\\" Attempts were made to implicate him in the murder of a private detective in South London, for a fire in a Wiltshire aircraft factory and for the murder of American singer Dean Reed. Reed had died the day before Miller had arrived in East Berlin to interview him. Miller's family was approached by private detectives seeking to implicate him in Reed's death, although they would not say who their client was. Another private investigator interviewed Miller's friends and associates, claiming to be acting for Reed's family, though they denied employing him. A former Scientology insider told the Sunday Times that Miller \\"is kept under constant watch. Every time he goes abroad a two-man mission will be waiting for him at the airport when he arrives. They will monitor where he goes, who he sees, where he stays. This information will be added to his file, which is already more than 100 pages thick.\\" Senior executives at publishers Michael Joseph and at the Sunday Times, which serialised the book, received threatening phone calls and a visit from private investigator Eugene Ingram, who worked for the Church. Another private investigator, Jarl Grieve Einar Cynewulf, told Sunday Times journalists that he had been offered \\"large sums of money\\" to find a link between Miller and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as the Church reportedly believed that the CIA was driving investigations into its tax affairs in the U.S. According to Cynewulf, Miller's mail and phones were intercepted and his home was under constant surveillance. The newspaper reported that Cynewulf had chased its reporter and photographer through the streets of Bristol, armed with a pistol which he fired at them, saying, \\"You'd better go now unless you want to end up in a wooden box. Do you want to be another Hungerford martyr?\\" In 1990, nearly three years after the book's first publication, a defector from the Church of Scientology provided the Sunday Times with internal documents detailing the smear campaign against Miller. These records listed several private investigators who had been hired to keep Miller under surveillance and feed false information about him to neighbours and the police. A Scientology executive had flown from Los Angeles to a flat in London where he and a private detective co-ordinated the campaign. Rubbish from the publisher's offices was regularly emptied into the flat's bathtub to be picked through. According to the informant, the investigators used contacts with the British police to try to implicate him in unsolved crimes: \\"People were brought in from abroad posing as journalists to arrange interviews with Scotland Yard where they would drop innuendoes about Miller. Other investigators were used to smear his name with colleagues, friends and neighbours. They worked hard on the line that he was an undercover British intelligence man.\\" A Church spokesman dismissed these allegations, saying, \\"anyone giving you this sort of information must be crazy or on drugs.\\" === Legal disputes === Gerry Armstrong, the former Scientology archivist whose disclosure of Hubbard's unpublished writings became a central issue in the litigation over Bare-faced Messiah. The Church of Scientology and related entities sought injunctions against the book's publication, claiming copyright infringement of Hubbard's private documents. They threatened to sue in as many as fifty countries, adopting a strategy that the University of Pennsylvania's Professor Paul K. Saint-Amour has described as \\"an international parade of litigation\\" and \\"whack-a-mole legal proceedings\\". Much of the dispute centred on the plaintiffs' argument that the actions of former Scientology archivist Gerry Armstrong in providing Miller with unpublished materials (whether directly or indirectly) were a breach of his duty of confidence to the Church, and that the use of excerpts from this material violated copyrights owned by Hubbard's estate. Miller later noted that the plaintiffs did not attempt to dispute the facts of the book in court which, he said, was a pity as he had been looking forward to defending his meticulous research.  United Kingdom  The first lawsuit was heard in the UK in October 1987 by Justice Vinelott. The litigants, the Church of Scientology of California, failed to obtain an injunction against the publication of the book. In his decision of 9 October 1987, the judge said that it was \\"clear that the public interest far outweighed any duty of confidence that could conceivably be owed to Mr. Hubbard or his church.\\" The unpublished materials were held to be \\"essential\\" if Hubbard's early career was to be \\"properly evaluated\\", and legal decisions against Armstrong in California could not bind an English court. The judge held that the Church had acted improperly in bringing its suit so late in the day. It had become aware in May of the plans to publish Bare-faced Messiah, but had not brought suit until 29 September, less than a month before publication. The application for an injunction, he said, \\"was made at a time, whether calculated or not, when the greatest possible damage and inconvenience would be caused to Penguin Books\\". No satisfactory explanation had been made for the delay and, in the judge's view, the application \\"was oppressive, and was not brought to protect any legitimate interest.\\" The judgement was upheld by the Court of Appeal on 22 October. The decision by Lord Justice Fox argued that Hubbard's \\"cosmic significance\\" in Scientology - a group which itself had been the subject of a Government report in 1972 - implied a strong public interest in the book's content. The delay in applying for an injunction was reason in itself to justify dismissing the appeal, but in addition the court ruled that \\"the public had an interest that assertions of fact [by the Church] should be exposed to public criticism. The founder was dead and the material was not alleged to be untrue.\\" The court noted that the plaintiffs had not argued that publication of the book would damage Hubbard's or the Church's reputation or that it was in any way defamatory. The Church was refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords. In advance of the court case, a female Scientologist was found collecting seven copies of the unpublished proofs from a copy shop in East Grinstead, near the Church of Scientology's UK headquarters at Saint Hill Manor. She was arrested but later released as there was no evidence of theft.  Canada, Australia and South Africa  In Canada, New Era Publications International ApS of Denmark — an arm of the Church of Scientology — petitioned the Federal Court of Canada to block the publication of Bare-faced Messiah in December 1987. New Era submitted its request days before publisher Key Porter Books planned to begin its print run. The company argued that its sales of Hubbard's books would be adversely affected by the damage that Miller's book would cause to Hubbard's reputation. It also claimed that copyright had been violated through the unauthorised excerpting of unpublished materials and books written by Hubbard, and that it would interfere with New Era's own plans to publish an \\"authorised\\" biography based on the same materials. New Era's bid was rejected by Justice Bud Cullen, who said that the evidence presented in favour of an injunction \\"falls far short of the evidence required\\" to sustain such a request. He characterised Hubbard as an author of \\"outlandish, foolish, vicious, racist writings.\\" Similar bids to block the book failed in Australia and South Africa.  United States  A suit was brought in the U.S. by New Era Publications in May 1988 that sought to prevent Bare-faced Messiah being distributed, after it had already been published and shipped. Prior to publication, New Era offered to buy out the publication rights to Bare-faced Messiah but was rebuffed. Publisher Henry Holt had distributed 12,500 copies by the time New Era obtained a temporary restraining order to prevent shipment of the remaining copies from the first print run. New Era's request for an injunction against the distribution of the existing copies was refused. Henry Holt's president, Bruno Quinson, declared his company's intention to fight the suit: \\"This is a case, to say the least, that has serious First Amendment considerations and we are vigorously opposing the Scientologists' efforts to prevent the publication of this book.\\" The district court that first heard the case ruled that, although the quotation of private correspondence breached copyright law, an injunction would deny the publisher's First Amendment rights. By coincidence, the judge who heard the case, Pierre N. Leval, was the same person who had recently heard a case involving the private correspondence of the writer J. D. Salinger, which resulted in a higher court's setting a controversial precedent that fair use protection could not be accorded to works that quoted unpublished material. His decision was seen as a repudiation of the higher court's Salinger precedent: \\"The grant of an injunction would ... suppress an interesting, well researched, provocative study of a figure who, claiming both scientific and religious credentials, has wielded enormous influence over millions of people.\\" When the case was appealed, the Second Circuit disagreed with Leval's judgement, arguing that copyright outweighed free speech arguments. Again coincidentally, the author of the decision was Judge Roger Miner, who had been among the authors of the Salinger decision. The court reiterated the Salinger finding that there was a \\"strong presumption against fair use of unpublished work\\" and that unpublished primary source materials should \\"normally enjoy complete protection\\" from fair use claims. This could not be overridden by the First Amendment. Nonetheless, the court still denied an injunction on the grounds of laches, specifically that New Era had waited two years to bring the case after first learning about the book. By \\"sleeping on its rights\\" — waiting too long — New Era had lost any right to equitable relief and had unfairly caused damage to Miller's publisher by the delay. Judge James L. Oakes agreed with the decision in a concurring opinion but argued that the majority had been wrong to reject the First Amendment as a defence. He argued, \\"Responsible biographers and historians constantly use primary sources, letters, diaries, and memoranda. Indeed, it would be irresponsible to ignore such sources of information.\\" Although they had prevailed, Henry Holt and Company asked all of the appeals court's judges for a rehearing en banc to establish that they had not just won on a technicality. The court denied this request by a 7–5 majority. The denial produced an unusual split between the judges; four who supported a rehearing stated that they believed that \\"copying some small amounts of unpublished expression to report facts accurately and fairly\\" was covered by fair use, while five who opposed it rejected that proposition, declaring that \\"under ordinary circumstances\\" the use of \\"more than minimal amounts of unpublished expressive material\\" should attract an automatic injunction. This argument was widely criticised following the case. David J. Goldberg and Robert J. Bernstein wrote in the New York Law Journal in May 1989 that the central problem with the majority's view was that: In 1990, Henry Holt petitioned the Supreme Court, which let the Second Circuit's judgement stand. The outcome of the case drew a concerned reaction from publishers and journalists, who complained that biographies would become much more legally and financially difficult to publish. A brief for the PEN American Center and the Authors Guild expressed the publishing industry's \\"confusion, consternation and concern\\" at the outcome. The American historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. called the decision \\"a great sadness\\", arguing that had it been made earlier, he could not have published all three volumes of his history The Age of Roosevelt. In the end, Henry Holt abandoned the litigation, as the ongoing legal costs were becoming unsupportable. The print run of Bare-faced Messiah in the U.S. was ended after only 14,000 copies were printed. Many went to public libraries, but, according to Miller, numerous library copies of the book went missing or had inserts pasted into them by Scientologists. == Reception == Reviews of Bare-faced Messiah were overall very positive, though some reviewers criticised what they regarded as omissions on Miller's part. The Church of Scientology was highly critical of the book. Its view of Miller's book was summed up by the executor of the Hubbard estate, who called it \\"a scumbag book ... full of bullshit\\", while a Scientology spokesperson in Canada compared it to \\"a life of Christ [written] by Judas Iscariot.\\" The American science writer Martin Gardner's review in Nature called Bare-faced Messiah an \\"admirable, meticulously documented biography\\". Gardner had previously written about the start of Scientology in his classic 1952 book Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science, at which time he regarded Hubbard as a harmless crank, but Miller's book persuaded Gardner that Hubbard was \\"a pathological liar who steadily deteriorated from a charming rogue into a paranoid egomaniac\\". Sociologist J. Gordon Melton wrote that along with Stewart Lamont's Religion Inc., Miller's book is \\"by far the best\\" among the books published by Scientology critics, though he notes that the Church of Scientology has \\"prepared statements on each [substantive statement] indicating factual errors and omissions.\\" Melton concludes that Miller's book is compromised by its author's lack of access to documents charting Hubbard's life and the early history of the church. Melton disputes Miller's assertion that Hubbard was lying about his military career: \\"Hubbard left the service in February 1946 with twenty-one citations, letters of commendation, and medals on his record. The details of Hubbard's naval career have been called into question by the critics of Scientology. Critics rely on an alleged copy of Hubbard's notice of separation deposited in the Veteran's Administration and accessible through the Freedom of Information Act.\\" However, the document on which the Church of Scientology bases its claim of twenty-one awards is a forgery, according to US government archivists, and lists ships and medals that did not exist. Writing for the Marburg Journal of Religion, the German Protestant theologian and history of religion scholar Marco Frenschkowski called Bare-Faced Messiah the \\"most important critical biography of Hubbard. Like [Friedrich-Wilhelm Haack's Scientology — Magie des 20. Jahrhunderts] and [Bent Corydon's L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman?] it is extremely polemical and very much tries to pull Hubbard to pieces.\\" He added that Miller's book had \\"definitely exposed some inflated statements about Hubbard's early achievements,\\" but the Church of Scientology has been able to counter a number of the points made by Miller: \\"Hubbard's assertions about his military career in WWII, e.g., have been much nearer to the truth than Miller is trying to show ... (a complete set of the relevant documents is part of my collection).\\" Miller states that he was unable to confirm the existence of Hubbard's mentor, Joseph \\"Snake\\" Thompson, but Frenschkowski confirms Hubbard's account that Thompson was an actual Commander in the US Navy Medical Corps and a personal friend of Sigmund Freud. Miller states that Hubbard was a disciple of Aleister Crowley, with the implication that Scientology derives from Crowley's teachings, but Frenschkowski concludes, \\"Nevertheless it remains quite obvious that Hubbard did not take much inspiration from Crowley and Parsons.\\" Writing in Kingdom of the Cults, an overview of new religious movements written from a Christian perspective, Walter Ralston Martin commented that of the various books on Hubbard's life, \\"none are so thoroughly damaging to his credentials\\" as Bare-faced Messiah and Bent Corydon's book. The British science fiction author and critic David Langford rated Miller's book as \\"altogether more even-toned and better- written\\" and argued that it \\"deserves to be a standard reference\\" on the life of Hubbard. Sociologist David G. Bromley described the book as \\"among the most significant\\" accounts of Hubbard's life. Janet Reitman, who documented the history of Scientology in her 2011 book Inside Scientology: The Story of America's Most Secretive Religion, called Bare-faced Messiah \\"the best and most comprehensive biography of L. Ron Hubbard.\\" Malise Ruthven observed in the Times Literary Supplement that Miller \\"forces no thesis on his readers, allowing them to draw their own conclusion from the facts he uncovers.\\" He took this as both a strength and a weakness of the book, in that it leaves open the question of whether Hubbard was a deliberate con-man or sincerely deluded. He also expressed frustration that Miller had not explained how Hubbard had achieved such a following, but complimented the author's meticulous research in separating fact from fiction. The satirical magazine Private Eye described the book as \\"meticulously documented\\" but observed that the author \\"does not theorise, nor even very often moralise. The reader must provide his own interjections, laughter and gasps of astonishment.\\" The Sunday Times described the book as \\"admirably written, well documented and it must have entailed a great deal of painstaking research.\\" It praised Miller for standing up to Scientologists' attempts to discredit him. The New Statesman praised Bare-faced Messiah as accessibly written and diligently researched but, like Private Eye, criticised it for not illuminating why people find Scientology appealing. Patrick Skene Catling's review in The Spectator recommended the book \\"unreservedly\\", calling it \\"an unsurpassably scathing study of money-mad, power-mad megalomania.\\" Peter Conrad, in The Observer, was generally complimentary about the book, but criticised Miller for omitting \\"the recognition of Hubbard's topicality. Miller treats him as a loony and a freak; in fact he was a morbid symptom of America itself\\". The psychologist and TV presenter Anthony Clare listed Bare-faced Messiah in The Times as one of his books of the year for 1987, commenting that it was \\"a testament to the gullibility of man in the face of the charlatanry of Scientology\\", while the film and literary critic Tom Hutchinson complimented Miller for \\"fascinatingly recount[ing]\\" what he described as Hubbard's \\"bizarre career.\\" In Canada, David Todd of news magazine Maclean's commended the way that Miller had \\"arriv[ed] at a portrait of [Scientology's] founder that is by turns hilarious and deeply unsettling\\", commenting that \\"while scathingly critical of Hubbard and his church, Bare-Faced Messiah is, in fact, scrupulously fair.\\" Michael Harrison of the Toronto Financial Post criticised the book for \\"lack[ing] a critical perspective beyond the requisite snide commentary\\" and professed himself disappointed by Miller's avoidance of the question of whether Hubbard was \\"genuine or just a fraud\\", which Harrison considered an important omission \\"since the questions of selfishness, integrity and motivation are key issues in biographies of people who suffer from the messiah-complex.\\". The Sydney Morning Heralds Judith White called the book \\"absorbing\\" and \\"well documented and graphically told.\\" Alan Roberts wrote in the Adelaide Advertiser that Bare-faced Messiah was a \\"minutely researched, densely evidenced account\\" of the \\"endless catalogue of deception, distortion and psychopathological mendacity\\" perpetrated by Hubbard and \\"almost tediously chronicled\\" by Miller. The Brisbane Sunday Mails reviewer characterised the book as \\"entertaining reading that packs a mighty punch\\", in which the impact was delivered by \\"Miller's careful and professional research which is evident in the manner he builds the man up and then knocks him down, fact by fact.\\" The Oregon Law Review described Bare-faced Messiah as \\"a revealing, enthralling biography of a controversial public figure.\\" Charles Platt, writing in The Washington Post', called the book \\"impressively thorough\\" though he chided Miller for \\"miss[ing] no opportunity to poke fun at Hubbard. Indeed, he belittles the man so thoroughly, the exercise almost begins to seem pointless.\\" He noted that in advance of the publication of his review, the Church of Scientology had sent his newspaper \\"a large package of documents intending to refute many of Miller's statements.\\" His review was subsequently disputed by the Church of Scientology International's vice president, Brian Anderson, who denounced the book in a letter to the newspaper, claiming that it had been \\"obviously calculated to make a quick buck capitalizing on L. Ron Hubbard's name\\" and was a \\"fast and shoddy\\" work. In response, Platt pointed out that \\"[Miller] does not dispute the success of L. Ron Hubbard's work; he merely presents evidence that suggests fraud. This is the point of Russell Miller's book, and I find it significant that Brian Anderson makes no attempt to answer it.\\" == Publication history == * 1987, UK, Michael Joseph (), First edition, Hardback * 1987, Canada, Key Porter (), Hardback * 1988, United States, Henry Holt (), Hardback * 1988, UK, Sphere Books (), Second edition, Paperback * 1993, France, Plon () as Ron Hubbard : le gourou démasqué (\\"Ron Hubbard: the guru unmasked\\"), French translation by Sibylle Lang * February 2014, UK, Silvertail Books (), Third edition, Hardback ;Serialisation A summary of the book was published in the Arts & Leisure section of the Sunday Times over the course of three articles. * \\"Science fictions\\".

It publishes one of the most prestigious academic journals in economics: the American Economic Review.Cynthia Clark Northrup, \\"American Economic Association,\\" The American economy: a historical encyclopedia, Volume 2, ABC-CLIO, 2004, , pages 9-10. The AEA was established in 1885 in Saratoga, New York by younger progressive economists trained in the German historical school, including Richard T. Ely, Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman and Katharine Coman, the only woman co- founder;Vaughn, Gerald F. (2004). \\"Katharine Coman: America's first woman institutional economist and a champion of education for citizenship.\\" Journal of Economic Issues 38(4): 989-1002. since 1900 it has been under the control of academics.The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd Edition (2008), American Economic Association (abstract). The purposes of the Association are: 1) The encouragement of economic research, especially the historical and statistical study of the actual conditions of industrial life; 2) The issue of publications on economic subjects; 3) The encouragement of perfect freedom of economic discussion. The Association as such will take no partisan attitude, nor will it commit its members to any position on practical economic questions. Once composed primarily of college and university teachers of economics, the Association now attracts an increasing number of members from business and professional groups. Today the membership is about 23,000, over half of whom are academics. About 15% are employed in business and industry, and the remainder largely by federal, state, and local government or other not-for-profit organizations. ==Activities== For many years, the AEA published three economics journals: the American Economic Review, the Journal of Economic Literature, and the Journal of Economic Perspectives (which is available online for free). In 2009, it began to publish four new area- specific journals, collectively called the American Economic Journal (AEJ). The four areas covered by AEJ are applied economics, economic policy, macroeconomics, and microeconomics. The AEA recognizes annually a Best Paper Award for papers published in each of the four. The AEA also publishes AEA Papers and Proceedings each May, featuring papers presented at the AEA meetings in January. Until 2017, these papers were published in the May issue of the American Economic Review. The AEA also produces EconLit, the AEA's electronic bibliography. It is a comprehensive index to peer-reviewed journal articles, books, book reviews, collective volume articles, working papers, and dissertations. Compiled and abstracted in a searchable format, EconLit indexes 125 years of economic literature from around the world. It follows the JEL classification codes of the Journal of Economic Literature. The AEA sponsors RFE: Resources for Economists on the Internet, an online source available to the general public without subscription. It catalogs and annotates 2,000+ internet sites under some 97 sections and subsubsections. RFE is currently updated on a monthly basis. The AEA resource, Job Openings for Economists (JOE) originated in October 1974, and lists job openings for economists. It is published electronically monthly (except January and July). AEA, in conjunction with over 50 associations in related disciplines, holds a three- day annual meeting to present papers on general economic subjects. This meeting features about 500 scholarly sessions. A placement service to assist employers and job applicants begins a day prior to the meetings. A continuing education program is held immediately after the annual meeting. Topics vary from year to year. Each year, the AEA recognizes the lifetime research contributions of four economists by electing them Distinguished Fellows. The Association also awards annually the John Bates Clark Medal for outstanding research accomplishments in economics to a scholar under the age of 40; it is often referred to as the \\"Baby Nobel,\\" as many of its recipients go on to become Nobel Laureates. ==Association presidents== , the president of the association is Janet Yellen, and the president-elect is David Card.

She served with the Red Cross as a medical auxiliary officer and interpreter during World War II, following British Army forces in 1944-5 across parts of newly liberated Europe. In 1946, she married Jan Szumigalski, (d. 1985) a former officer in the Polish Army, and lived with him in north Wales before immigrating to Canada in 1951. They had four children: Kate (born 1946), Elizabeth (1947), Tony (1961) and Mark (1963). She spent the rest of her life in Saskatchewan, first in the remote Big Muddy valley, then in Saskatoon.http://library2.usask.ca/szumigalski/about == Writing career == Most of her fifteen books are collections of poetry, but she also wrote a memoir, The Voice, the Word, the Text (1990) as well as Z., a play about the Holocaust. Her first book, Woman Reading in Bath (1974), was published by Doubleday in New York. Thereafter she made the deliberate choice to publish her work with Canadian presses. She helped found the Saskatchewan Writers Guild and the literary journal Grain, and served as a mentor to many younger writers. Szumigalski combined a love of the Canadian Prairies with a passion for language, a faith in poetry and an intimate knowledge of literary tradition. She was a great admirer of William Blake, some of whose visionary qualities appear in her own work. Her finest work is collected in a big volume of selected poems, On Glassy Wings (Coteau, 1997). In 2006 her literary executor Mark Abley edited a volume of her posthumous poems, When Earth Leaps Up. A final posthumous book is expected in 2010. The Manitoba Writers Guild has set up a scholarship in her name.http://www.mbwriter.mb.ca/index.php/szumigalksiSCHL/ The Saskatchewan Book Award for Poetry is named for her. Her papers are held at the University of Regina, and University of Saskatchewan.University of Saskatchewan Special Collections Anne Szumilgalski website == Awards == In 1989, she was awarded the Saskatchewan Order of Merit. Her 1995 collection Voice, featuring paintings by Marie Elyse St. George, won the Governor General's Award for English language poetry.

Its product disclosed its hazardous nature by prominently displaying skull and crossbones on its outer package and came in two varieties; Death, and Death Lights. The product was marketed to the “young underground punk rock” consumer market. The products were sold for a time via mail order from Luxembourg to avoid the United Kingdom's excise tax; however, after some time, the Customs and Excise department disallowed this sales channel. ===The company=== The company's plans to offer sponsorship to the Pacific Racing F1 in 1994 fell through after Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna were killed at the San Marino Grand Prix. That year the company was turned down by the \\"top five poster contractors\\" who would not provide the company with permission to use their sites because of its \\"blunt\\" marketing message and a pending parliamentary bill restricting tobacco advertising. The company \\"was losing a million pounds per year\\" and could not afford a massive advertising campaign. The firm's trademark rights were successfully challenged by an alcohol company called Black Death. The impending lawsuit barred the sale of Death cigarettes and the company closed down. ==Markets== Death cigarettes were mainly sold in the United Kingdom, but was also sold in the United States, Norway and Finland. ==References== ==External links== * To the Best of Our Knowledge 12/31/2006: Wisconsin public radio interview with Boz Temple-Morris, co-founder and Marketing Director for the Enlightened Tobacco Company.

The channel deals primarily in scripted television series and films and was well known in its early years for featuring unconventional and often risqué programming. ==History== Licensed in 1994, Showcase was a venture between Alliance Communications (prior to its merger with Atlantis), the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and a number of smaller independent Canadian producers, and was intended to be a showcase for \\"the best of independently- produced movies, drama, comedy and mini-series from Canada and around the world\\", with limited content from the United States.CRTC Decision 94-280 It launched at midnight on January 1, 1995, with a short introductory montage and its first program, Monty Python's Life of Brian, shown as part of its program The Showcase Revue.Showcase Television launch (January 1, 1995) right When the network launched, it garnered some negative publicity due to a disclaimer that it would broadcast prior to reruns of older series. The disclaimer, which advised viewers to remember that \\"attitudes were not always the same as they are now\\" was applied to relatively recent programs such as Seeing Things. Following media scorn and accusations of political correctness and being condescending to viewers, Showcase abandoned this form of disclaimer. Showcase later spawned two digital television services, the male-oriented Action (formerly Showcase Action, which was relaunched into the Canadian version of Adult Swim in April 2019 “First Ever 24-Hour Adult Swim Channel Coming To Canada Next Month.” Screen Rant. March 4, 2019) and the more female-oriented Showcase Diva (which was relaunched as a Canadian version of Lifetime in 2012). On December 19, 2006 Alliance Atlantis launched a high definition simulcast of Showcase.Alliance Atlantis Launches High Definition Channels Broadcaster Magazine 2006-10-11 Only one HD feed, simulcasting the East feed, launched prior to the shutdown of the West feed. It is carried on all major Canadian television service providers. After several acquisitions over the years, Alliance Atlantis gained full control of Showcase. On January 18, 2008, a joint venture between Canwest and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners known as CW Media bought Alliance Atlantis and gained AAC's interest in Showcase. Following its acquisition by Canwest, the channel's new management felt that Showcase's adult programming was alienating viewers and advertisers. In August 2009, Showcase underwent a major rebranding, introducing a new programming lineup with a greater focus on hit dramas and films. Canwest executives hoped that the new lineup would make the channel more attractive to viewers and advertisers. While Showcase continues to air a thematically broad range of drama programming, its most recent successes, especially in original programming, have been with science fiction and fantasy programming. In 2010, a new original series, the supernatural crime drama Lost Girl, brought the channel its highest-rated series premiere ever with around 400,000 viewers. This was bested less than two years later by the debut of another original sci-fi series, Continuum, which had an average audience of 900,000 viewers. On October 27, 2010, ownership changed again as Shaw Communications gained control of Showcase as a result of its acquisition of Canwest and Goldman Sachs' interest in CW Media.Shaw Communications closes purchase of Canwest TV assets, rebrands as Shaw MediaCRTC approves Shaw’s purchase of the Canwest Global television properties For the Fall 2013 season, Showcase unveiled a new tagline and branding campaign: \\"Character is Everything\\". The four-week marketing campaign was highlighted by promos narrated by characters from Showcase's series in first-person. An interactive website was created by Stitch Media. On it, viewers can create their own trailers for Showcase programming based on their own character.http://www.characteriseverything.ca/ To coincide with the campaign, Showcase tweaked some of its on-air graphics. On March 30, 2015, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the network's launch, Showcase underwent a brand refresh, including a new logo — an updated version of the network's logo from 2000 — and a new slogan: \\"Beyond Ordinary\\".https://www.facebook.com/showcasedotca/photos/pb.57521976614.-2207520000.1427755210./10152694415356615/?type=3&theater; ==Programming== left From the beginning, Showcase has aired reruns of Canadian series, with the lineup changing from year to year, along with foreign series and independent films. It's known for carrying numerous TV series from American cable channels such as TNT and Syfy. In recent years, the channel has also increasingly aired second window repeats of both premium and network television series (the latter primarily sourced from its sister television network, Global). Showcase has also aired first-run Canadian series, dubbed \\"Showcase Originals\\". In the past, these have included Paradise Falls, KinK, and Naked Josh. Another of these shows, the low-budget Trailer Park Boys became a bona fide national phenomenon, spawning DVDs, merchandising tie-ins, and two feature films (Trailer Park Boys: The Movie and Trailer Park Boys: Countdown to Liquor Day). The success of Trailer Park Boys led to the increasing prominence of edgy and risqué programming on Showcase (which at the time used the tagline \\"Television Without Borders\\"), including a block consisting entirely of its eroticism-themed shows known as Fridays Without Borders. In recent years, Showcase has partaken in international co- productions. The channel was formerly subject to a condition of licence obligating it to air 100% Canadian content between 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. in the time zone of the originating feed (currently Eastern Time only).CRTC Decision 2001-153 While some foreign programming did air in the late afternoon prior to this window, any foreign programming subject to watershed restrictions was required to air at 10:00 p.m. EST or later. For a few years beginning in fall 2005, when the channel was drawing most of its highest ratings for programming acquired from U.S. cable networks, Showcase promoted 10:00 p.m. as its flagship timeslot, even hiring branded taxis in major markets to drive people home for free by 10:00 p.m. In March 2015, the CRTC announced it would no longer enforce conditions of licence related to nature of service; (paragraph 254) shortly thereafter, Showcase began airing foreign content in the 7-10 p.m. EST window for the first time. The channel previously operated two timeshifted feeds operating on Eastern and Pacific Time Zone schedules. The West feed was discontinued on August 24, 2012; since then, much of the channel's primetime programming has been rebroadcast on a three-hour delay to facilitate consistent promotion to both time zones (for example, if a program broadcasts at 9:00 p.m. EST and rebroadcasts at midnight EST, it would be promoted as airing at \\"9:00 p.m. E/P\\"). ===Original programming=== Includes programs co-commissioned with international broadcasters. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Analog cable television networks in Canada Category:Television channels and stations established in 1995 Category:Corus Entertainment Category:English-language television stations in Canada ","title":"Showcase (Canadian TV channel)"},{"id":"2236136","text":"is a four-part erotic original video animation series, part of the Vanilla Series, set in a fantasy world. ==Story== A young shepherd by the name of Cain Asbell finds inside a remote cave a vase containing the fairy Elise. Once released, Elise leads Cain to a remote cabin, where bandits had left the Princess Charlotte tied up. Cain's rescue of the princess is rewarded with lordship over the realm of Norland and a chance at the hand of the beautiful Princess. ==CharactersMain characters=== *Cain Asbell: The Lord of Norland, Cain is responsible for keeping order and protecting the land and its people. His kindness and purity of heart has earned him many allies and confidants, which leads Norland to victory over the Lord of Tedmond, Francis. He weds the Princess and becomes King of the entire land. *Princess Charlotte: Blond-haired princess of the entire realm and heir to the throne of the kingdom of Phlaburg. On her 20th birthday, she is to marry the strongest Lord of the land. While Norland and Tedmond were neck-in-neck at the end, it would be Norland who would ultimately become the strongest land, and Cain Asbell the King and the Princess' husband. *Francis: Lord of Tedmond, and Cain Asbell's main rival, Francis is as cruel and ambitious as Cain is kind and selfless. He rules Tedmond with an iron fist, and is not afraid to be out in the open taunting his rival and others. However, it is his bravado and cruelty that eventually leads him to ruin, as Cain's allies eventually stop the Tedmond army and capture Francis. *Chiffon: A light-haired, half-elven priestess appointed to Cain Asbell to be his advisor during his reign as Lord of Norland. She has a distrust of humans due to being brutally treated by them as a young child and teenager. Her cold heart soon begins to warm as Cain earns her trust. Once Cain becomes king, she returns to her church, her duties fulfilled. *Tsubaki: A raven-haired swordswoman from the island of Yapan. She appears in Norland at the beginning of Cain Asbell's reign and challenges him to a duel. Being inexperience in battle, Cain tries to avoid fighting her. She easily defeats him, but is soon challenged by \\"the Mysterious Masked Warrior\\" (Princess Charlotte). After the Princess' swift defeat, she gives Cain inspiration, which leads him to victory over Tsubaki. Tsubaki becomes Norland's Arms Trainer and strategist, whose excellent fighting skills saved the Wood of the Dwarves from the Kingdom of Tedmond and later lead Norland's people to safety from the Tedmond army. She becomes Captain of the Guard when Cain becomes king. *Tia: A pink-haired slave girl who was being sold by slave traders in Norland when Cain and Chiffon interfered. In gratitude for setting her free, Tia became Cain's maid and cook. It was due to her bravery that she was able to retrieve Tedmond's strategy plans, which eventually led to Norland's victory over Tedmond. She stays on as Cain's handmaid after he becomes king. *Sandra: The red-haired leader of the Emerald Fist, a bandit group from a distant land. Sandra was once the daughter of a Lord who was eventually betrayed and imprisoned. The new Lord sold Sandra into slavery, but nothing else is revealed about her childhood. She wears a patch over her right eye, for reasons unknown, and wields a belted zanbato blade. Even though she has taken everything of worth from Norland, it is through Cain Asbell's kindness that she redeems herself and helps Cain beat Francis and the Tedmond army. She is pardoned by the newly crowned king, and leaves with her band of thieves to another country in order to start a new life. ===Minor characters=== *Ann: Small, brown-haired, ambassador of the Dwarves, who is appointed to Norland after Tsubaki's victory over Bagwell in the contest for the Dwarven Woodlands. Ann is very apprehensive about the role, however, since her position is to always try to stay neutral in the war. However, at the climatic point when all seemed lost for Norland, Ann and the Dwarves come to their aid and become instrumental in the fall of Lord Francis and Norland's victory. *Bagwell: A warrior who, as a young man, was defeated by Tsubaki's father in dojo combat. Not willing to lose, he took Tsubaki hostage and killed Tsubaki's father. Bagwell then proceeded to rape and kill Tsubaki's mother. Tsubaki would later volunteer herself to face Bagwell in the contest between Tedmond and Norland to determine who would gain lordship of the Dwarven Woodlands. Through her superior skill, Tsubaki bested and killed Bagwell, winning the match for Norland. *Elise: The fairy that was rescued by Cain Asbell. Elise stays around early in Cain's reign as Lord of Norland, protecting the land. She shows herself less and less as time moves on, only when Cain is very troubled by a problem that could lead to a bad end for either himself, his allies, or the realm of Norland. *\\"The Mysterious Masked Warrior\\": A parody of the Magical Girl genre, the Masked Warrior (Princess Charlotte in disguise) uses quick moves and the power of \\"Love Escalation\\" in an attempt to beat Tsubaki. The effort fails, but her defeat leads Cain to ultimate victory over Tsubaki. ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== * Category:1999 anime OVAs Category:Hentai anime and manga ","title":"MeiKing"},{"id":"2236141","text":"Son of Paleface is a 1952 American Comedy Western film directed by Frank Tashlin and starring Bob Hope, Jane Russell, and Roy Rogers. The film is a sequel to The Paleface (1948). Written by Tashlin, Joseph Quillan, and Robert L. Welch, the film is about a man who returns home to claim his father's gold, which is nowhere to be found. Son of Paleface was released in the United States by Paramount Pictures on July 14, 1952. ==Plot== Peter \\"Junior\\" Potter (Hope) has graduated from Harvard and heads west to the western town of Sawbuck Pass to claim his father's fortune. Driving into town in a jalopy, wearing a comical plaid suit, he splashes mud all over a crowd of townspeople. He discovers to his horror that practically everyone in town claims to be owed money by his father, and that his father's treasure chest is empty. Strutting around town in his dramatic red and white striped Harvard blazer, Junior stalls the townfolk for as long as he can, continually making allusions to his wealth. An old-timer, Eb, convinces him the gold does exist, but it is hidden. In the saloon, he makes the acquaintance of a singing cowboy named Roy (Rogers) and a sexy saloon performer with the masculine name of Mike (Russell), who has to fend off Junior's persistent advances. In the bar, Mike and Roy sing \\"Buttons and Bows\\" while Potter raps about Harvard. Junior tries to romance Mike and she drugs him. While he is asleep, she assumes her alter ego of \\"the Torch\\" and leads her gang in a night time raid. Junior provides a perfect alibi. The townsfolk have sabotaged Junior's car, but he improvises and adds cart wheels to escape the town. He drives across the desert with two vultures hitching a ride. He goes to the ghost town of Sterling City. He finds Eb dead in a barber's chair. Roy arrives and accuses him of murder. Junior disguises himself as Roy to try to escape on Trigger. Roy is a government agent with a Smith & Wesson Model 320 Revolving Rifle hidden in his guitar case, bent on capturing her. The town is attacked by Indians. Junior is at first too scared to fight and Roy fights alone. Paleface's ghost appears and convinces him that Hell is fine. He grabs a gun and starts firing. Firing from the barber's chair, it starts to spin with shots going in random directions. One shot hits a moose head, where his father's gold begins to pour out. Mike arrives and helps in the fight. Mike and Junior escape on his improvised car. Roy fights the gang in their hideout in an abandoned mine. With a bit of accidental help from Junior, they win the fight. Junior is waiting for Mike when she comes out of prison (with four Junior Juniors). They say goodbye to Roy as Trigger has a triumphant rear-up silhouetted against the sunset. ==Cast== * Bob Hope as Peter \\"Junior\\" Potter Jr./Peter Potter * Jane Russell as Mike \\"the Torch\\" Delroy * Roy Rogers as Roy Barton * Trigger as Trigger, Roy Barton's horse * Bill Williams as Kirk * Lloyd Corrigan as Doc Lovejoy * Paul E.

The airport has a single terminal with two gates. ==History== The first aerodrome in Whangarei was located on Pohe Island, in the upper reaches of Whangarei Harbour. Sir Charles Kingsford Smith's aircraft, the Southern Cross, landed on Pohe Island in 1928. This airstrip was not of high quality due to it being built on boggy reclaimed land, so a more suitable site was required. Another site was considered, at Kensington Park, but in May 1939 the current site was opened at Onerahi. Whangarei airport, 1942 With the outbreak of World War II, immediately after the establishment of the airfield, the airport was taken over by the RNZAF to serve as a training base which became RNZAF Station Onerahi. Flight Lieutenant \\"Lou\\" Gates became one of the station commanders. Pilots practiced bombing raids on the nearby Matakohe Island and Rat Island. The airport was established with three grass runways. No. 20 Squadron RNZAF was formed there in August 1942 with Hawker Hind biplanes, personnel and aircraft provided from No. 6 (AC) Squadron RNZAF at Milson, Palmerston North. The squadron was disbanded in July 1943 (before being reformed elsewhere later in the war). The station was reduced to two runways (06/24 and 32/14) shortly after the war, and being converted for public use. Some of the old airforce barracks are still present today, having been converted into residential properties. NAC the National Airways Corporation began twice daily commercial flights between Whangarei and Auckland in 1948, using Lockheed Electra 10 seater aircraft. NAC replaced the Electra in March 1950 with small de Havilland Dominie 6 seater aircraft, as the airport was too small to handle the new Lockheed Lodestar aircraft that was now in use. The aircraft's small size meant it serviced Whangarei with six return flights daily from Auckland. 10,148 people flew to and from Whangarei in 1950. The runway, 06/24 was upgraded and sealed in December 1963 to its current length of 1097 m, to allow NAC to commence commercial flights with the much larger DC3s. A new airport terminal was built on the northern side of the main runway to cater for future growth. A new control tower was also built. The larger capacity of the DC3 meant Whangarei was serviced only twice daily to Auckland, with some flights continuing north onwards to Kaikohe or other Northland airports. In August 1970, NAC replaced their DC-3 service to Whangarei with larger Fokker Friendships. Northern Districts Aero Club introduced a twice daily return air taxi service to compete and provide additional frequency to Auckland on each Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The service, which operated under the name of Executive Air Taxis, started on 21 August 1970 using a newly imported Piper Cherokee Six. This service proved to be popular, and was expanded by the end of 1974 to offer a twice daily Monday to Friday morning and afternoon return service to Auckland. Northern Districts Aero Club were able to fund new clubrooms and hangar in 1977. In 1988, NAC's successor Air New Zealand announced the withdrawal of their twice-daily Friendship service in favour of their newly purchased subsidiary Eagle Airways offering up to five Embraer Bandeirante flights a day. This led to the decline and eventual end of the Northern Districts Aero Club scheduled flights to Auckland. The control tower was closed down in 1988 as the airport was deemed too small to continue the service. In 1991, a new airline, Ansett New Zealand, began flying to Whangarei in competition to Air New Zealand. Both airlines flew Bandeirantes, with Ansett also flying Dash 8's, and the terminal was further upgraded due to this growth. In September 1998, Ansett New Zealand withdrew its service. To help meet the demand for additional seats, Eagle Airways increased its services by 14 per week, bringing the number of Bandeirante flights to Whangarei to 69 flights. This compared with Air New Zealand's previous service of 14 Friendship flights a week. In 2001, Eagle Airways purchased 16 new Beechcraft 1900D aircraft and begun using this aircraft on all routes, retiring the Bandeirante aircraft being used. They were able to introduce new services with the improved aircraft and in 2002 begun direct flights linking Whangarei to Wellington. This service operated twice every week day (until 2009 when it was reduced to one) and was Eagle Airways' longest regular flight service at 626 km with 90 min flight. In 2007, Sunair begun daily air services between Whangarei, Tauranga, Rotorua and Napier. This service was discontinued in 2009. Sunair returned to Whangarei in 2015, with a Whangarei to Whitianga via Claris service. This service ceased at the end of 2015 after low patronage. In 2008, Salt Air begun an \\"xpress\\" service between Kerikeri, Whangarei and Auckland. These flights landed at North Shore and transferred passengers to Auckland CBD within 60mins of leaving Whangarei. This service was sold in 2012 to Flight Hauraki and ceased shortly after. A runway upgrade in 2009 allowed Bombardier Q300 and weight restricted ATR 72 aircraft to begin using the airport. In 2011, a Mount Cook Airline ATR 72 landed at Whangarei Airport becoming the first of its kind to do so. The aircraft was on charter from Gisborne. From April 2015, Air New Zealand removed all Beech 1900D flights from the Whangarei schedule, as well as dropping the direct to Wellington service. The flights were taken over by larger Q300 aircraft and they became the sole aircraft flying to Whangarei for Air New Zealand. ==Airport growth and future== Whangarei Airport, shortly after 2009 upgrades. In 2009, airport passenger and flight numbers were increasing steadily reaching a peak of ten return flights to Auckland and two return flights to Wellington on weekdays. This resulted in the airport's capacity reaching a peak of around 140,000 passenger movements per year. However this growth stalled due to global economic downturn, and subsequently capacity and frequency was reduced. A project costing $1.5 million that created a 30 m takeoff starter extension and resealed the runway surface was completed in April 2009. The upgrade allowed larger aircraft to land and allowed Air New Zealand, through its subsidiary airline Air Nelson, to start trialing flights with their Bombardier Q300 aircraft. Daily flights from Auckland commenced in August 2013 growing in time to be the predominant aircraft used on the Auckland route, before becoming the sole aircraft used in 2014. In August 2011, the previously weight restricted ATR 72 aircraft made its first commercial service to Whangarei Airport on charter from Gisborne, however the aircraft type has not returned since. WDC are currently looking at potentially moving the airport to a new location, as the current site is too small to expand significantly to meet requirements for larger aircraft in the future. A runway length of between 1200m and 1350m is needed to accommodate aircraft that are likely to be in use beyond the next 10–15 years. A site at Mata, south of Whangarei was considered, but was deemed too far from central Whangarei to be viable. Another site at the former location of Port Whangarei is being mooted in 2014, but a move is not considered likely due to operational requirements and cost. If a decision is reached to move the airport it will not be before 2025, and will have to overcome great cost and uncertainty surrounding the demand for such a large airport in relative proximity to Auckland. On 30 June 2015 an upgrade to the airport costing $1.02 million was announced. The aircraft taxiway was expanded to accommodate the bigger aircraft that are operating at the airport now, as well as improvements to pathways outside the terminal and the taxi stand. A second airport entry was constructed and the car park was extended with a barrier arm installed. Improvements within the terminal included more seating for passengers, upgraded toilets and the internal baggage claim area was expanded. Work began in July 2015 with the last of the upgrades completed by Mid-September 2016. The work enabled the airport to be kept to an acceptable and modern standard for the next 15 years, when possible relocation of the airport may take place. ==Airlines and destinations== An Air Nelson Q300 arriving at Whangarei Airport ==Airport services== The new glass walk-through tunnel, shortly after completion, 2011 The airport has a modern air-conditioned terminal building with free wifi and a cafeteria (called The Apron), which services Air New Zealand's subsidiary, Air Nelson. The terminal was recently upgraded to include a glass walk-through tunnel, to protect passengers from the weather when accessing the tarmac parking gates 1-2. The airport terminal has secure parking, and three rental car companies. Whangarei District Airport no longer has an Aero Club due to a drop in membership and private flying. Flight training using micro-light aircraft is still available after through the Whangarei Flying Club which merged with the Northern District Aeroclub when it closed down, and Sports Flying Academy located in hangar 8. A tandem and sport skydiving company (Skydive Ballistic Blondes) operates from their base on Domain Road. Helicopter operators Skywork and Twin Coast Helicopters both operate from the airport. One aircraft maintenance facility (Northland Aviation Ltd) is available, which conducts maintenance for airlines and many aircraft across Northland. Private jets are also catered for when they arrive about twice a year, as well as larger group charters which are fairly common. BP provide Jet A1 and AVGAS on field for aviators. Since 2006, an AWIB (Aerodrome Weather Information Broadcast) system has been broadcast on 119.8. ==Incidents and accidents== Northern Advocate photo of 2010 accident. *19 November 1955: A Tiger Moth owned by the Northland Districts Aero Club crashed into Whangarei Harbour and two people were injured.

Colwell directed the Singers for their first year, passing the leadership to Antony Walker and Elliott Gyger, who directed the Singers until 1999. Many of the original members were composition students of Peter Sculthorpe including Stephen Adams, Matthew Hindson, and Canadian composer Jana Skarecky. The Contemporary Singers varied in size between 12 and 30 voices, and developed a repertoire of over 70 works by about 55 different composers, giving Australian premiere performances of many significant works for chamber choir. Some members also sang with the Sydney Chamber Choir and subsequently with Walker's professional choir Cantillation.

Born in Hannah, North Dakota, United States, Ethel Catherwood was raised and educated in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, where she excelled at baseball, basketball and track and field athletics. In 1926, as a student at Bedford Road Collegiate, she equalled a Canadian record for high jump at the Saskatoon city track and field championships. On Labour Day of the same year, she broke the British-held high jump world record. In 1928, she became a member of the Matchless Six, a group of 6 Canadian women who competed at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, the first Olympics to allow female competitors in athletics. Catherwood took home a gold medal in high jump, clearing . There was considerable focus on her physical attributes during the Games earning her the nickname \\"Saskatoon Lily\\". As well, a New York Times correspondent dubbed her the \\"prettiest girl athlete\\" at the 1928 Olympics. However, much more than a pretty face Ethel Catherwood took home the world's first ever gold medal awarded to a female high jumper and holds the title as the only Canadian female athlete to have won an individual gold medal in an Olympic track and field event. Catherwood also held national titles in javelin throw, but this event became Olympic only in 1932, whereas she retired from competitions a year earlier. Upon her return from the 1928 Olympics, Catherwood was offered a movie contract, but declined the offer. She took a business course, married, and moved to California. In 1955, she was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, the Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame in 1966, and the Saskatoon Sports Hall of Fame in 1986. Catherwood had an enigmatic life. After the Olympics, where she was feted as the beauty of the games, she was surrounded in scandal.

John Hamilton Gray was named in honour of two different people who shared the same name: * John Hamilton Gray, the fifth premier of the British colony of Prince Edward Island and one of Canada's Fathers of Confederation. * John Hamilton Gray, the second premier of the British colony of New Brunswick and also one of Canada's Fathers of Confederation. Both men lived in the same era and ended up in public service in the neighbouring colonies of Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, which this vessel would connect as a ferry. ==Ferry service== John Hamilton Gray was launched in May 1965 as hull 349 at the Marine Industries Limited shipyard in Sorel, Quebec, and sub-assemblies were built by the Davie Shipyard in Lauzon and towed by barge to Sorel to be completed on the ferry. She was fitted out on November 1, 1967, and delivered in October 1968. The sea trials took place in September 1968. Her designers were the Montreal design firm of German & Milne. Her owner was the Canadian National Railway (CN), operator of the Borden-Tormentine service from 1918–1977. Beginning in May 1972, John Hamilton Gray was used during the peak travel season on CN's Cabot Strait services from North Sydney to Channel-Port aux Basques and Argentia. The seasonal service to Newfoundland typically lasted until November, whereby John Hamilton Gray would return to the Northumberland Strait service for the winter icebreaking season where she served alongside . Her summer participation in the Newfoundland service ended in September 1988 in advance of 's entry into service in 1989. In 1977, CN created a subsidiary CN Marine to operate its ferry services. In 1986, CN Marine changed its name to Marine Atlantic, the last operator of the ferry service between Borden and Cape Tormentine. Throughout the 1970s until the new MV Abegweit entered service in 1982, John Hamilton Gray was the largest and most powerful ferry on the Northumberland Strait. John Hamilton Gray was designed to be compatible with the A Dock at both Borden and Cape Tormentine which was in use by the original MV Abegweit (and whose design is traced to the SS Prince Edward Island). John Hamilton Gray loaded only from the stern on the lower rail/truck deck, however until a modification in the early 1980s (in advance of the arrival of the new MV Abegweit), the upper car deck was loaded from a side hatch at the stern. The modification in the early 1980s saw the side hatch sealed and a stern loading hatch added. On December 31, 1989, John Hamilton Gray hauled the last railcars and locomotives off Prince Edward Island as CN Rail abandoned its former Prince Edward Island Railway trackage in the province. John Hamilton Gray was chartered for two summers by \\"Croisières Carleton-les-Îles\\", a private ferry company in Quebec's Gaspé Peninsula during 1995 and 1996, running a passenger-vehicle service between Carleton-sur-Mer and Cap-aux- Meules, Quebec in the Magdalen Islands. John Hamilton Gray departed the Northumberland Strait for the final time on April 28, 1997, when she headed to Point Edward, Nova Scotia for disposal. The pending opening of the Confederation Bridge on May 31, 1997, would result in the permanent closure of the ferry service and Marine Atlantic only required three vessels (, , and ) during the last month of operation. ==Casino cruise service== John Hamilton Gray was sold in July 1997 at Point Edward by the Government of Canada's Crown Assets Division to Contessa International, a casino cruise company in the United States. The vessel was overhauled at a shipyard in Les Méchins, Quebec, and departed for West Palm Beach, Florida, in November, no longer a ferry but a casino cruise ship. Carrying the new name Contessa I, the vessel operated cruises from West Palm Beach from 1998 to 2001. Still owned by Contessa International, she was managed by Kyma Ship Management of Panama and renamed Texas Treasure II. The vessel operated casino cruises from Freeport, Texas in late 2001 and early 2002 then from Port Aransas, Texas, for the remainder of the 2002 season before being mothballed at Freeport, Bahamas, and placed for sale, following the failure of U.S. Coast Guard safety and U.S. government hygiene inspections. ==Scrapping== The vessel was renamed Treasure and sailed to the Alang Shipbreaking Yard in Alang, India. The Lloyd's Registry shows the vessel as demolished on March 15, 2004; however, records indicate that the vessel departed Freeport on April 30, 2004, passing the Suez Canal on June 11 and being scrapped later that month. ==References== Category:Ferries of Prince Edward Island Category:Ferries of New Brunswick Category:CN Marine Category:Marine Atlantic Category:1965 ships Category:Ships built in Quebec Category:Transport in Prince County, Prince Edward Island ","title":"MV John Hamilton Gray"},{"id":"2236236","text":"Misery Signals is an American-Canadian metalcore band formed in Wisconsin in 2002. ==HistoryFormation (2002–2003)=== Misery Signals was formed after the disbandment of several bands, including 7 Angels 7 Plagues, Hamartia, and Compromise. Having played briefly with 7 Angels 7 Plagues, former Compromise vocalist, Jesse Zaraska, was approached by Ryan Morgan and Kyle Johnson for a new project which would become Misery Signals. Jeff Aust from Hamartia joined on as second guitar and Ryan Morgan's brother Branden joined as the band's drummer. Aust soon left the band and has since gone on to join With Honor. He was replaced by Stu Ross, a friend of Jesse Zaraska's from St. Albert, Alberta. In 2003 the band released its eponymous debut EP. The EP was dedicated to the memory of Jordan Wodehouse and Daniel Langlois, who were killed by a drunk driver on Interstate 20 near Heflin, Alabama while on tour with their band Compromise in support of 7 Angels 7 Plagues. ===Ferret Music (2004–2009)=== The band eventually signed to New Jersey's Ferret Music, releasing their first full-length album, Of Malice and the Magnum Heart. After extensive touring resulting in friction between Zaraska and band members, Zaraska was asked to leave. The band began auditioning vocalists via Myspace, announcing Karl Schubach as Zaraska’s replacement with whom they recorded the album, Mirrors. In July 2008, Misery Signals released their third full-length entitled Controller. After extensive touring in support of Controller in early 2009, members of Misery Signals wanted to pursue other musical directions outside of their band. ===Side Projects (2009–2010)=== Schubach is involved in a heavy metal side project called Solace. He is the sole member of the band, recording guitar, bass and vocals in a D.I.Y.-fashioned home studio. The drums are added in digitally, through the use of a program on his Macbook. During the funding stages of this side project he provided incentives to individuals and bands in return for financial support using crowd funding platform Kickstarter. As part of this incentive scheme Karl Schubach provided guest vocals on a song by UK metal/hardcore band The Divided. Hardcore/punk band Burning Empires consists of members from Misery Signals, Fall Out Boy and 7 Angels 7 Plagues, with vocalist Ryan Morgan, bassist Kyle Johnson, guitarists Stu Ross and Matthew Mixon, and drummer Andy Hurley. The quintet also owns a clothing line / record label called Fuck City. Milwaukee-based punk/post- hardcore band Lowtalker consists of Branden Morgan and Stuart Ross of Misery Signals. They team up with Casey Hjelmberg and Matt Keil of Comeback Kid to complete the four-piece project. Lowtalker released their EP People Worry About Everything in the spring of 2010 through FC records. In 2010, Stuart Ross became the frontman of a Vancouver, B.C. pop-punk band Living with Lions. Ross officially left Misery Signals on September 25, 2010 to put his focus on Living with Lions, and was reportedly tired of performing heavy metal. In October 2010, Kyle Johnson also announced his departure from the band. ===Absent Light (2011-2015)=== After an extended period of inactivity with a heavy focus on side projects, Misery Signals made an official statement about the state of the band in November 2010. The press release addressed the loss of Ross and Johnson, and also announced that the band had not, in fact, broken up. Ryan Morgan commented that, \\"In the next few months, we'll group back up and return.\\" On maintaining the continuity of the band's style and keeping the same name, Morgan said, \\"Stu and Kyle made awesome contributions, but the trajectory of the band remains the same in their absence. If the time came that our sound took a drastically different course, then it wouldn't be Misery Signals anymore, and we wouldn't pretend that it was.\\" The first new release from Misery Signals after going through this major line up change was a cover of Pink Floyd's song \\"Us and Them\\" from the 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon. The song was contributed to a soundtrack for the video game Homefront, which was released free of charge for digital download on March 22, 2011. In April 2011, Karl Schubach posted a couple tweets mentioning band practice, writing new material in June, and said \\"We're focusing on bringing the new guys up to speed at the moment.\\" The new lineup was finalized and appeared on the Crush Em All tour fall 2011. In early 2012 the band stated that they were working on new material for the new album. Lead singer Karl Schubach stated in an interview \\"I think every band aims to progress with each album they write. But sometimes progression is learning what worked really well the previous records and incorporating those elements. So far these new songs feel like a purposeful blend of our most recent, more structured Controller record mixed with the chaos and spontaneity of the earlier Of Malice and the Magnum Heart.\\" All of the members reunited in the studio the recording the new album, and started an Indiegogo fundraiser to help pay for the recording, marketing, and pressing of the new album, as the band is currently signed to Basick Records. On July 23, 2013, Misery Signals released Absent Light, with the first single \\"Luminary\\" being released twenty days earlier. On May 30, 2014, news surfaced that Misery Signals announced plans to commemorate the tenth anniversary of their 'Of Malice and the Magnum Heart' album with the \\"Malice X Tour\\" later that year. The tour featured the band's original lineup, which consisted of Jesse Zaraska (vocals), Ryan Morgan (guitars), Stu Ross (guitars), Kyle Johnson (bass), and Branden Morgan (drums), and Misery Signals performed the album in its entirety. ===Ultraviolet (2016-present)=== On October 19, 2016, rumours of an original lineup reunion tour and album were confirmed by vocalist Jesse Zaraska. When reached for comment by Nic Huber of www.metalinjection.net, Zaraska had the following to say: \\"It is the truth, sir. We are in the midst of writing new material together and will be playing some show over the coming year. It has been very cool thus far. We will definitely be doing a proper US tour in 2017.\\" On March 24, 2018, at the event Midwest Meltdown in Iowa City, Iowa; Misery Signals frontman Jesse Zaraska, announced the band had been holed up on Boise, Idaho over the previous few weeks. He stated that they are, indeed, working on a new album. Zaraska stated on stage, that he believes their newest album \\"will be the BEST Misery Signals album yet.\\" When asked about the style of the new album, Zaraska replied \\"It will probably be a lot like of Malice.\\" On the \\"Death to False Metalcore Tour 2019\\" with Darkest Hour and Unearth, the band played a song titled \\"Sunlifter\\" from their Absent Light B-Side vinyl release. Zaraska also stated November 2019 as the release date for their new album. On May 8, 2020, a 26 second fixed-camera video of ocean waves, with only the date \\"05.15.2020\\" appearing center screen at the end of the video, was posted to Misery Signals’ social media accounts, suggesting that new music, or a new album, is set to be announced, and/or released, on that date. On May 14, 2020, Misery Signals announced their upcoming fifth studio album, Ultraviolet, to be released on August 7, 2020, along with the release of the single “The Tempest” ==Members== ;Current * Ryan Morgan – lead guitar, backing vocals (2002–present) * Branden Morgan – drums (2002–present) (Lightyrs) * Jesse Zaraska – vocals (2002–2006, 2014–present) * Stu Ross – rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2002–2010, 2014–present) (Comeback Kid) * Kyle Johnson – bass guitar (2002–2010, 2013–present) ;Former * Karl Schubach – vocals (2006–2014) (Solace) * Jeff Aust – guitar (2002) * Gregory Thomas – rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2011–2014) (END) * Kent Wren – bass guitar (2011–2013) ==Timeline== ==Discography== ;Studio albums * Of Malice and the Magnum Heart (2004) * Mirrors (2006) * Controller (2008) * Absent Light (2013) * Ultraviolet (2020) ;EPs * Misery Signals (2003) * Sunlifter b/w Like Yesterday (2016) ==References== Category:Musical groups established in 2002 Category:Heavy metal musical groups from Wisconsin Category:American metalcore musical groups Category:2002 establishments in Wisconsin Category:Ferret Music artists ","title":"Misery Signals"},{"id":"2236238","text":"Anna Maria Lenngren, née Malmstedt (June 18, 1754 – March 8, 1817), was one of the most famous poets in Swedish history. Her father and brother were also poets. One of her best-known poems is Några ord till min kära dotter, ifall jag hade någon (\\"Advice to my dear daughter, if I had one\\"). She also wrote on Sweden's class system in the satirical poems against snobbery Hans nåds morgonsömn (\\"His Grace's morning snooze\\") and Grevinnans besök (\\"The Countess's visit\\"). ==LifeEarly life=== Anna Maria Lenngren was born in Uppsala as the daughter of the poet Magnus Brynolf Malmstedt (1724–1798), a professor in Latin at Uppsala University, and Märta Johanna Florin (d. 1788). Her father was a member of the Moravian Church and was known for his social work; from 1772, he hosted a school for poor children in his home. Both her parents published hymns, and her brother Johan Magnus (1749–80) wrote secular poems. Anna Maria Lenngren became set against religion and in favor of the realism of the age of enlightenment through dislike of her father's passionate religious feelings; but her humanism and passion for social justice have also been attributed to her father's influence. In her social views, she felt sympathy for the working classes, opposed the privileges of the nobility and acted as a spokesperson for the \\"third estate\\", idealizing a simple and humble life style. Her father observed her talent early on, and stated that he wished to \\"make of her not only a literary, but a learned woman\\". He gave her an advanced education, and she was tutored at home in Latin and the Classics of antiquity. Her favorite poet was Horace. ===Early career=== She began her career in poetry with reviews, epitomes, epigrams and translations in the 1770s. Among her earliest works were interpretations of Horace, published anonymously in the press. In 1772, she published her first poem under her own name, the funeral poem '. In 1774–77, she frequently wrote for Anna Hammar- Rosén's paper '. In 1776 she was commissioned by Duke Charles, the King of Sweden's brother, for a translation of the French operetta Lucile, the first French operetta translated into Swedish. In its introduction, she defended women's right to intellectual work. It was a success: Lenngren was awarded a golden clock as a token of appreciation by the royal Duchess Charlotte, and was given several similar translation commissions by the royal house. Lenngren enjoyed great success: already in 1774, she was inducted into a literary society in Uppsala, earned good reviews and poetic tributes in the press, became known as a defender of intellectual women, and referred to herself as a \\"litterata\\". She became a member of the Royal Society of Sciences and Letters in Gothenburg in 1775, and of the Utile Dulci in 1779. She was one of only three women members of the Utile Dulci, the others being Anna Charlotta von Stapelmohr and Anna Brita Wendelius. In 1777, she repeated her demand in favor of women's right to intellectual pursuits in Thé-conseillen. ===Married life=== In 1780, she married the official Carl Peter Lenngren (1750–1827). He was the chief editor of ', which the famous poet and critic Johan Henric Kellgren and he published. Kellgren worked with Lenngren on several assignments from 1778 onwards, reportedly providing her with inspiration, and sharing an interest in the ideas of Voltaire. She published poems and prose in ' from 1778 onwards, but after her wedding, she only published anonymously, stopping altogether by the end of the 1780s. Her marriage caused a great change in her life. After her wedding, she officially stopped being active in the literary world, publishing under pseudonyms, renouncing her previous stand in favor of women's intellectual and literary emancipation, and arguing that women should avoid literary pursuits in favor of developing their character as suitable wives and mothers. Whether she was honest in this change of opinion, or was using irony to make a point, has been the subject of debate. Lenngren came to admire Rousseau, and may have come to support his ideas of the role of women in the 1780s, views further supported by the religious values of simplicity and humility in her childhood home. Ingrid Arvidsson argued that Lenngren had a deeply ambivalent view on the subject, affected by her personality: \\"The fact that Mrs L was hurt by criticism is evident in several of her poems, but she did also have the more unusual sensitivity of being hurt by admiration\\". After her marriage, she hosted a literary salon, which became a center of cultural debate frequented by Gustaf af Leopold, Nils von Rosenstein, Frans Michael Franzén and Gudmund Jöran Adlerbeth. During these years she is described as witty and intelligent but humble and modest. Her spouse was described as \\"principally known as useful and boring\\", but the marriage was a happy one, and she used to take him to the Utile Dulci Academy and sing with him. She had no children, but adopted a daughter. In 1797 the daughter was placed in a mental asylum, but died soon after her admission, an event which affected Lenngren deeply, as did the death of her father, who drowned under suspicious circumstances in 1798. In 1790, another great change occurred when Johan Henric Kellgren discontinued his literary production because of an illness. This damaged the paper of her spouse and Anna Maria Lenngren resumed her contributions in ' for financial reasons. However, she insisted on staying anonymous and refused to officially resume her career, although unofficially her pseudonyms were known and she was known as the writer of the work which she published during these years, though she insisted on remaining officially anonymous. Her salon at Beridarebansgatan was the center of the Royal Swedish Academy, and though she was never a formal member, they called her their \\"invisible member\\". On December 20, 1797, the Royal Swedish Academy celebrated her with the ' (\\"Ode to Mrs Lenngren\\"), read by Gustaf Fredrik Gyllenborg. She declined their admiration with the poem ' (\\"Dream\\"), in which she described how the poet Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht had appeared to her and deemed her unworthy. However, she signed ' with her own name, the first that she had written under her own name since her marriage, and her last. Lenngren died of breast cancer aged 62, and was buried in Stockholm's Klara kyrka cemetery. ==Literary career== Anna Maria Lenngren debuted as a writer of poems for funerals and weddings, and her earliest work has a tone of the ecstatic passion common in the religious circles of her father. This was however quickly replaced by a more sober tone in line with the scientific sense and realism of the age of enlightenment. As a writer, Lenngren frequently used satire, sarcasm, and irony, and she often made parodied the genre of pastoral, opera and ballad. Her verse was often short, portraying everyday life, almost always in a city environment, and she criticized artificiality and lack of genuine value behind the facade. Ideologically, she was inspired by her personal friend and colleague Johan Henric Kellgren, with whom she often worked from 1778 onward. Fredrik Böök says that \\"there was every word needed and no more, almost no adjectives. She painted with only verbs and substantives\\", and Snoilsky writes in his poem ' (\\"An evening at Mrs Lenngren's\\"): \\"It's like a burdock, this witty meter\\". Her successful early career during the 1770s was influenced by her feminist ideas, foremost her defense of women's right to participate and engage in intellectual work. This is most evident in the forewords of her translation of Lucile (1776) and her poem ' (1777). The radical change in her views of women's role which took place in her work after her marriage in 1780 has been the subject of much debate. In her poem ' (\\"Advice to my dear daughter, if I had one\\") and , she advice women to renounce intellectual aspirations and focus on shaping their character morally to that on an ideal wife and mother. She advice women to concentrate on domestic tasks rather than attempt to meddle in intellectual or political pursuits, because \\"Our household is our Republic; our politics is our appearance\\". She herself officially discontinued her career after her marriage by only publishing her works under anonymous pseudonyms and refusing to admit to them. However, Anna Maria Lenngren is famed for her great love for irony, which has created uncertainty about whether she meant what she said literary or if she wished to prove her point by irony. Her poem Dröm, which was given as a response to the admiration from the Academy in 1797, and in which she describe herself as unworthy, has also been interpreted as ironic in this regard. Anna Maria Lenngren was a supporter of the realistic and scientific views of the age on enlightenment and disliked religion, sometimes interpreted as a protest against the religious environment of her childhood home. She had radical views on Sweden's class system, opposed the privileges of the nobility, and defended the rights of the \\"third estate\\" or working class against oppression. She criticized the snobbery of the nobility, the humble admiration their servants gave them and the anxious bowing of the working class, and portrayed the male members of the upper class as cold and merciless and the female members as snobby and ridiculous. A realist, she idealized \\"the third class\\", was inspired by the French Revolution. Above all, she fought for the intellectual freedom of women; that also women should be allowed to have opinions, and criticized male double standards. Her best-known poems on the class system are ' (\\"Morning prayer of His Grace\\") and ' (\\"Visit from the Countess\\"), in which she satirizes snobbery, and ' (\\"Boys\\"), in which she laments the fact that children of all classes can play with each other during their childhood, but that this solidarity and friendship is destroyed when they became adults, along with the popular ' (\\"There was no oatmeal but still a happy Christmas\\"), in which she describes the effects of poverty. ==Legacy== Lenngren's tombstone at ' in Stockholm Anna Maria Lenngren is one of the most famous poets in the history of Sweden. Her production has made her one of the few 18th-century Swedish poets who are still commonly read, and she has been published a number of times after her death during the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. In accordance with her instructions, her collected poems were published after her death by her widower under the name ' (\\"Attempts at Poetry\\"). After its publication, the Royal Swedish Academy had a memorial medal made with the inscription: \\"The less she sought fame, the more she gained it\\". Her correspondence with her personal friend Gustaf af Leopold from 1795 to 1798 has been published. ==In fiction== Anna Maria Lenngren is portrayed in the novel ' (\\"Chamber-pot child\\") by Anna Laestadius Larsson from 2014, where she, alongside Ulrika Pasch, Ulrika Widström, Jeanna von Lantingshausen, Marianne Ehrenström and Sophie von Fersen, becomes a member in a Blue Stockings Society organized by the Queen of Sweden and Norway, Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein- Gottorp. ==Works== ;Poems: * ', Upsala, 1772 * ', Upsala veckotidningar, 1772, Upsala * ', Upsala, 1774 * ', Upsala vecko-tidning, 1774 * '''' * ', Uppsala, 1775 * ' Uppsala, 1778 * Impromptu, Lunds vecko-blad, 1775 * ', Stockholm, 1777 * ', 1778 * ', 1798 * ', 1819 * ' (The Portraits) * ' (Visit from the Countess) * ' (Miss Juliana) * ' (His Grace's morning snooze) * ' (The Boys) * ' (The happy party) * ' (Advice to my dear daughter, if I had one) 1794 * ' (Other fabrics, Other customs!) ;Prose: * Contributions in ', 1774–1777 * Contributions in ', 1778–1803, 1809–1810, 1814–1816 * Contributions in ', 1789–1791, 1793, 1796–1797, 1801, 1816 * Contributions in ', 1792, 1794–1797, 1801 * Contributions in ', 1795, 1796, 1798, 1800, 1803, 1816 ;Translations: * J F Marmontel: Lucile operetta, 1776 * ', Comedie ballet, 1778 * ', Heroide, 1778 * C-S Favart: Arsene, comedie, 1779 * O Wolff: ', 1819 ==See also== * Sophia Elisabet Brenner ==Further reading== * Anna Maria Lenngren – Svenskt biografiskt handlexikon * Anna Maria Lenngren – Nordisk Familjebok (2nd edition) * ==References== ==External links== * Samlade Skaldeförsök – Anna Maria Lenngren's collected works Category:Swedish-language writers Category:Swedish women poets Category:Swedish women's rights activists Category:Deaths from breast cancer Category:Deaths from cancer in Sweden Category:1754 births Category:1817 deaths Category:People from Uppsala Category:Writers from Stockholm Category:Swedish salon-holders Category:18th- century Swedish women writers Category:18th-century Swedish writers Category:Translators from French Category:Translators to Swedish Category:Members of the Royal Society of Sciences and Letters in Gothenburg ","title":"Anna Maria Lenngren"},{"id":"2236244","text":"London Suite is a play by Neil Simon, consisting of four one-act plays.

His films include Hey, Happy!, Stryker, Guy Maddin: Waiting for Twilight and To Russia with Love. His work frequently deals with themes of homosexuality, social exclusion, dystopia and utopia. ==Background== Gonick was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1970. His father, Cy Gonick, is a reputed Marxist economist and former member of the Manitoba Legislature. As a youth, Noam showed a strong interest in theatre. While in elementary school, he started a small theatre company composed of other children from his neighborhood. At 16, he lived briefly in Berlin, Germany, where he worked as an actor in an experimental theatre troupe. After returning to Canada, he met and began working with filmmaker Guy Maddin, who would have a seminal influence upon his early work. Gonick attended and graduated from Ryerson University in Toronto, earning a BFA with a major in Film. He edited Ride, Queer, Ride (1997) a collection of writings on and by filmmaker Bruce LaBruce, who would prove to be another important influence on Gonick's filmmaking. In 2007, he was made the youngest inductee to the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. He is currently president of the board of directors at the Plug-In Institute of the Contemporary Arts. ==Personal life== Gonick has been in a relationship with artist Michael Walker since March 2016. ==Film and television== Gonick's first film was the 1997 short 1919, a historically revisionist depiction of the Winnipeg General Strike, as seen through the window of a gay oriental barbershop and bathhouse. MoMA selected the film as one of the best gay and lesbian films from the last fifteen years. His next film was the documentary Guy Maddin: Waiting for Twilight, narrated by Tom Waits and featuring Shelley Duvall. The film captures Maddin as he begins production on Twilight of the Ice Nymphs (1997). The documentary received acclaim on the festival circuit and went on to a successful life on television. Gonick would follow up with the experimental short Tinkertown in 1999, while also writing and developing his first feature, Hey, Happy! (2001). The cult-styled film, set in the Winnipeg rave scene on the eve of an apocalyptic flood, was distributed in North America and Europe, and was listed in Artforum's selection of best movies of the year. In the early 2000s, Gonick directed a number of episodes of Canadian documentary television series KinK, before returning to film with Stryker (2004), a feature he co-wrote with David McIntosh. Stryker strikes a comic-tragic tone in its colourful depiction of the bleak realities of Aboriginal youth and working-class transsexuals. The film was photographed by Ed Lachman, and featured a cast of mostly amateur actors. It premiered at the Venice International Film Festival. In 2007, Gonick wrote and directed Retail, a comedy TV pilot. Gonick's early interest in theatre was given renewed outlet in his creation of two short documentaries about important Canadian theatre figures: Hirsch (2010), on Hungarian-Canadian director and co-founder of the Manitoba Theatre Centre John Hirsch, and What If? (2011), on Leslee Silverman, celebrated artistic director of Manitoba Theatre for Young People. Some of Gonick's recent installation art has included elements of live performance. Gonick directed the documentary To Russia with Love, featuring LGBT athletes competing in and responding to the Sochi Olympics. The film was nominated for a GLAAD Award and was streamed worldwide on Netflix. In 2016 Noam began directing the series Taken for APTN about murdered and missing Indigenous women. ==Installation== Gonick's work in installation art began in 2006 with a collaboration with Rebecca Belmore that was shown at the Venice Biennale. Since that time, he produced several installation works incorporating film and video elements. Wildflowers of Manitoba (2007) is a performance piece and film installation created in collaboration with Luis Jacob. Housed in a geodesic dome furnished as a teenaged bedroom, the frame swells with projected images of homoeroticism in the Canadian Shield, evoking a \\"romantic vision of bliss, sensuality and sexual return to the land.\\" It premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival, and has been exhibited worldwide. Precious Blood (2007), commissioned by the Ontario College of Art and Design, consists of a scale model of the Provincial Remand Centre, a Winnipeg detention centre. Video of interviews with girlfriends and friends of inmates is displayed on the façade of the model, as these young men and women harbour outside the centre in hopes of catching glimpses of their incarcerated loved ones inside. The piece's title derives from the name of the modernist church designed by Etienne Gaboury, who was also architect of the Remand Centre. Commerce Court (2008) is a satirical commentary on the corruption and greed of the financial industry. Projected originally onto a six-story building in Commerce Court, the world headquarters of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, it features Roman Danylo in the role a banker on the verge of nervous breakdown. The installation premiered at Toronto's Nuit Blanche on October 2, the eve of the passing of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the first bailout of the U.S. financial system. No Safe Words (2009) is a multi-channel video installation that uses sports broadcast recaps and scorecards as a point of departure for examining athletic stadiums as sites of violence, from varsity hazing to political torture, while exploring the possible homoerotic undertones of such violence. The piece, broadcast originally on JumboTron screen during Toronto's 2008 Pride March, has also been interpreted as a commentary on the deradicalization of the gay pride movement. == References == ==External links== * http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2005/36/noam_gonick/ * Lucy Parsons & The Chicago Anarchists film project boards * Pulse Berlin Interview Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:Artists from Winnipeg Category:Canadian screenwriters Category:Film directors from Winnipeg Category:Writers from Winnipeg Category:LGBT directors Category:Jewish Canadian artists Category:Jewish Canadian writers Category:LGBT Jews Category:LGBT screenwriters Category:LGBT writers from Canada Category:Gay writers Category:Canadian Film Centre alumni Category:LGBT artists from Canada Category:Gay artists Category:21st-century Canadian artists Category:21st- century Canadian screenwriters Category:Canadian installation artists ","title":"Noam Gonick"},{"id":"2236262","text":"Cowboy Hill is an Oklahoma Historic Site located on a bluff overlooking the Salt Fork of the Arkansas river in Kay County, Oklahoma.

According to the foundation's website, the organization started with the purpose of conducting demographic research on televangelism and other religious television programming. During a series of scandals in the 1980s and 1990s, The Trinity Foundation established itself as a watchdog group which provided information about fraud and abuse by religious groups. ==Investigating televangelists== Trinity Foundation's investigative work into the fundraising tactics of big-money televangelists first came to national attention in 1991 following a Primetime Live hidden-camera look at televangelist Robert Tilton. The foundation was instrumental in providing evidence for the many state and federal investigations of Tilton in the years that followed. Trinity has primarily investigated televangelists such as Benny Hinn, Kenneth Copeland, Joyce Meyer, Paula White, Peter Popoff, Robert Tilton, W.V. Grant, pastor Edwin Barry Young, and the Trinity Broadcasting Network. Much of its information comes from disgruntled former employees, moles working for ministries who secretly (and under constant threat of termination and lawsuit) provide information to Trinity, and dumpster diving for information. The Trinity Foundation has an extensive video library of televangelists. They routinely take notes of the televangelists broadcasts. The notes go back at least ten years for most shows that air on religious networks. This information is used to aid reporters who are investigating televangelists. The head investigator at The Trinity Foundation is Pete Evans, who is a private investigator. Regarding Hinn, Trinity claims to have evidence showing that Hinn's ministry does not qualify as a church under Internal Revenue Service guidelines, as reported by The Dallas Morning News in July 2005. Specifically, Trinity claims that Hinn's ministry does not hold regular public worship services at its facility, as access is strictly limited to employees with access badges. Trinity has also investigated the St. Matthew's Churches/Church By Mail, Inc., a \\"seed-faith ministry\\" of James Eugene \\"Gene\\" Ewing which targets the poorest zip codes in America with religious mailings. ==Senate Finance Committee investigation== The foundation was directly involved in Sen. Charles Grassley's Senate Finance Committee investigation of abuses by a number of televangelist ministries. Beginning in 2005, after being asked to help by the committee’s general counsel, the foundation submitted over the next six years 38 separate reports on abuses by religious not-for-profit organizations, which were incorporated into the committee’s final report. The foundation recently criticized Sen. Grassley for turning to the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA) for suggested solutions instead of acting on tough legislative proposals from his staff for policing abuses by religious organizations. The foundation claimed the ECFA's recommendations were too lax and were compromised by close ties to the very ministries they were proposing to oversee. ==Other programs== The Christian community of around 50 members that grew from Bible studies formed under the umbrella of the foundation over the years established itself in 2010 as Community on Columbia, an independent church congregation separate from the foundation's oversight, but still in friendly cooperation and agreement with its mission. The church took over the longstanding ministry of helping the homeless that the foundation began. The foundation also published The Wittenburg Door, a magazine of Christian satire, from 1996 to 2008. ==Other controversy== Some former members of the group have been critical of it and Anthony. There have been accusations of abuse and cultism. ==References== == External links == * * The Wittenburg Door website * \\"God's Work: Ole Anthony wants both to take down the world's largest Christian TV network and to make better waffles\\" -- D Magazine article November 12, 2012. * Radio interview with Ole Anthony - Pilgrim Radio Network - interview by Bill Feltner, November 2012. * \\"The Trouble with TBN\\" - November 8, 2012 Christianity Today article on Trinity Foundation's work in exposing the TBN scandals and the quandary that poses for mainstream ministries. * God Doesn't Need Ole Anthony--The Antichrist of East Dallas: The man televangelists hate (Reprinted from The New Yorker, Dec. 6, 2004). * \\"Televangelist watchdog group questions ECFA response to Sen.

Roughly one quarter of the individuals are pied, with dark and white feathers, and the rest, known as bronze shags, are dark all over. Both morphs breed together. These large, chunky birds are about 70 cm long, weigh about 2–3 kg, and are slightly larger than Foveaux shags. They can be distinguished from Foveaux shags by their facial ornamentation in the breeding season: Foveaux shags have dark orange papillae on their face, whereas Otago shags have both papillae and small bright orange facial caruncles above the base of the bill. == Classification == Until 2016, Otago shags and the closely related shags living around Stewart Island and Foveaux Strait were considered to be a single species, called the Stewart Island shag. Mitochondrial DNA suggests Otago shags are actually more closely related to Chatham shags (Leucocarbo onslowi), and osteological and genetic differences supported separating off Foveaux shags as a distinct species, L. stewarti. Foveaux and Otago shags probably diverged when populations were split up by lower sea levels in the Pleistocene, and the Chatham Islands were subsequently colonised by shags from Otago. Other taxonomists have kept the Otago shag and the Foveaux shag conspecific. A recent taxonomic revision argues that Leucocarbo is a distinct genus, which would contain amongst other species the Otago, Foveaux, and Chatham shags. Others place it in the genus Phalacrocorax. == Distribution and conservation == Archaeological evidence shows that Otago shags were formerly found along the entire east coast of the South Island up to Marlborough, but when humans arrived the population was devastated, reduced by 99 percent within 100 years with a corresponding loss of genetic diversity. It became restricted to the rocky offshore islets off the Otago Peninsula, and has scarcely recovered since that time. There are less than 2500 Otago shags remaining, but they can be seen at Otago Harbour, as far north as Oamaru, and as far south as the Catlins. Restricted to a small area, and having little or no genetic variation, they require conservation efforts tailored to these extinction risk factors; this could include reintroduction to part of their former range. Otago shags breed colonially from May to September, making raised cup nests out of organic material and guano on islands and sea cliffs. Colonies are large enough to be strikingly visible, and are used year after year. One notable colony is on the northern shore of Taiaroa Head, at the mouth of the Otago Harbour. They feed in coastal waters less than 30 m deep and are rarely if ever seen inland or far out to sea. == References == == External links == * Otago shag discussed on RadioNZ Critter of the Week, 4 March 2016 Otago shag Category:Birds of the South Island Otago shag Category:Endemic birds of New Zealand ","title":"Otago shag"},{"id":"2236316","text":"Bose has sold aviation headsets since 1989 and consumer headphones since 2000. The current range of headphones/headsets consists of over-ear, in-ear, aviation and military models. == Over-ear headphones == Development of the company's noise-cancelling headphones (and first over-ear headphones) began in 1978 when the chairman, Amar Bose, tried a set of airline-supplied headphones during a flight and found that engine noise from the aircraft prevented the music from being enjoyed. In 1986, Bose and Sennheiser both presented active noise-cancelling headsets for aircraft pilots, with the Sennheiser design appearing in a Funkschau (see Funkschau article on the German Wikipedia) paper and the Bose design appearing in an ASME paper. p. 13 A prototype Bose product was used to prevent hearing loss in pilots during the first non-stop around- the-world flight in the Rutan Voyager. The company was the first to release active noise cancelling headphones as a consumer product. === QuietComfort 25 === Bose QuietComfort 25 with Carry Case. The \\"QuietComfort 25\\" (QC25) over- ear headphones were released in 2015 as the replacement for the . Unlike its predecessors, the QC25s can be used (without the noise-cancelling function) while the battery is dead. Another change is the elimination of the Hi/Low switch which increased the input gain for low-output sources like MP3 players. In 2014, the QC25s won the What Hi-Fi? Sound and Vision annual award for \\"Best Noise Cancelling Headphones\\". === QuietComfort 35 === QuietComfort 35 II The QuietComfort 35 was released in 2016 as a successor to the 25. It supports Bluetooth wireless operation, the Bose Connect mobile app for advanced audio control, and contains an embedded rechargeable battery. In 2017, Bose released an updated model known as the QuietComfort 35 II, which adds a customizable \\"action\\" button on the left ear cap. By default, it is mapped to activate the Google Assistant, making it the first headphones to integrate with the service. The QC35 II was reviewed favourably for their noise cancellation, audio quality and comfort. In July 2019, users began to report that a firmware update to the QC35 II had inhibited the performance of the noise cancellation features. Bose stated that it had not made any changes to noise cancellation functions in their firmware. Some users performed firmware downgrades, but Bose later prevented this for security reasons. In October 2019, as part of an investigation, Bose began to allow owners within a \\"reasonable\\" proximity to the company's headquarters in Framingham, Massachusetts, to request a visit by a technician. In 2020, Bose released the Bose QC35 II Gaming, which adds a gaming mic. === Noise Cancelling Headphones 700=== In 2019, Bose released the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, a new high-end product positioned above the QC 35. It features a more contemporary design with a stainless steel band, and are controlled using a mix of buttons and touch-sensitive areas on the cups. Unlike the QC 35, they do not fold in half, but their earcups can rotate for storage. The embedded rechargeable battery is not replaceable which limits the lifespan of the headphones to the life of the battery. Bose promoted improvements to sound quality, noise cancellation and voice call quality over the QC 35. The NCH700 can also connect to two devices simultaneously, and integrate with Amazon Alexa and Siri in addition to the Google Assistant. == In-ear headphones  QuietComfort 20 === The \\"QuietComfort 20\\" (QC20) and QC20i in-ear headphones were released in 2015 and are the company's first in- ear noise cancelling headphones. The QC20 model is for Android, Windows and Blackberry devices, while the QC20i is designed for Apple devices and includes volume controls on the remote. The noise-cancelling hardware and rechargeable battery is contained with a box located near the headphone jack, similar to the . The earbuds are similar to the IE2 headphones. A button on the remote labelled \\"Aware Mode\\" reduces noise-cancellation to let in ambient noise. ==Industrial headphonesA20 Aviation Headset=== The \\"A20 Aviation Headset\\" was released in 2010 as the successor to the \\"Aviation Headset X\\" (aka A10). It has a claimed battery life of 45 hours (using two AA batteries) or can be powered by the airplane's electrical system. There are two versions, one with Bluetooth and one without. An updated version of the A20 was released in 2015. ===Combat Vehicle Crewman Headset=== A \\"Combat Vehicle Crewman Headset\\" was released in 1998, for use in armoured vehicles. ===Triport Tactical Headset=== A \\"Triport Tactical Headset\\" (TTH) was released in 2004. It is designed for use in armoured vehicles and can fit under an infantry ballistic helmet. An updated version was released in 2012. ===Audio sunglasses Bluetooth headphones=== The Bluetooth sunglasses were released in 2019 and come in two styles – alto and rondo.

A two-time NBA All-Star, he won two NBA championships with the Lakers over the Philadelphia 76ers at the onset of their Showtime era in the 1980s. ==Early life== Born the third of three boys to Mary Jo and Elmer Nixon, in Macon, Georgia, his mother contracted myasthenia gravis when Norm was a baby, and his parents divorced when he was two years old. The three boys were also raised with the help of his mother's mom and aunt (the boys' grandmother and great aunt). He and his two brothers, Ken and Ron, attended the Methodist church, and Norm became an usher.Howard-Cooper, Scott. – \\"Nixon realistic about latest comeback – If it doesn't work out, he can always write his poem on life in the NBA\\". – Los Angeles Times. – (c/o – Houston Chronicle). – January 8, 1989. ===High school=== He played basketball and football in high school at Southwest High School in Macon, Georgia, and was named to all-state in both sports. In football, he played defensive back and tailback, and was later offered a free agent tryout by both the Pittsburgh Steelers and Dallas Cowboys.Livingston, Bill. – Little Guy Nixon Doesn't Fear Contact, Especially in Playoffs\\". – The Philadelphia Inquirer. – May 24, 1983. He was senior class president and named as the starting guard on the Georgia All-State team for 1973, after leading Southwest to the 1973 state high school basketball championship under coach Donald \\"Duck\\" Richardson. Nixon also played the trumpet and was on the yearbook staff. He was on the track team, ran the 440 yard dash, and won a regional title in the high jump at 6 feet, 5 inches. ==College== He played four full seasons at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. While there he averaged 17.2 points-per-game (PPG), 5.5 assists-per-game (APG), and 4.0 rebounds-per-game (RPG), scoring 1,805 points and adding 577 assists in 104 games for his career with the Duquesne Dukes.Norm Nixon. – Basketball-Reference.com. Nixon was named first-team All- Eastern Eight Conference, and left holding the record for career assists. On January 27, 2001, during the halftime of a game against Xavier University (Cincinnati), the Duquesne University Department of Athletics retired the jerseys of five of its all-time greatest players, including Nixon's #10 (also retired: Chuck Cooper, Sihugo Green, Dick Ricketts and Willie Somerset).Duquesne University Men's Basketball History: \\"Retired Jerseys\\" . – Duquesne University Athletics. – Retrieved: September 17, 2007. In 2019, Nixon gave his blessing for his retired number 10 to be worn by sophomore point guard Sincere Carry. Carry requested to wear it in order to pay tribute to a friend who wore number 10 in high school, and who fell victim to gun violence in the spring of 2019. ==NBA careerLos Angeles Lakers=== Nixon was the 22nd overall pick in the 1977 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Lakers. He played for the Lakers for six successful seasons and helped the Showtime Lakers win NBA championships in 1980 (4–2) and 1982 (4–2), both against the Philadelphia 76ers. The same two teams would meet in the 1983 NBA Finals, but Philadelphia won this series four games to none. In the 1978 (Seattle SuperSonics), 1979 (Seattle), and 1981 (Houston Rockets) playoffs, the Lakers were eliminated by the eventual Western Conference champion. He led the team in scoring in the 1982 playoffs. In game one of the 1983 finals he had a violent collision with Andrew Toney of the 76ers early in the first quarter. As he came off the floor, coach Pat Riley asked Nixon \\"You need a blow?\\", to which Nixon replied: \\"No, a casket\\". He would continue to play in game one and game two despite a separated shoulder. ===San Diego/Los Angeles Clippers=== Prior to the start of the 1983–84 season, the popular Nixon was traded to the San Diego Clippers in exchange for the draft rights to guard Byron Scott. Lakers general manager Jerry West made the deal to free Magic Johnson, the team's other point guard, from sharing the ball with Nixon. In his first year with the Clippers, Nixon led the league in total assists and made the All-Star team for the second time in the 1984–85 season. After the 1985–86 season, he spent much of his later career on the injured list, spending more than two full seasons on the injured list before retiring for good at the end of the 1988–89 season. During his time with the Clippers he would never make it to the playoffs again. For the 1978–79 season he tied Eddie Jordan of the New Jersey Nets for the NBA lead in steals with 201,\\"1978-79 NBA Expanded Leaders\\" – Basketball-Reference.com and total games (82 regular season + 23 playoffs = 105). The next season (1979–80) he led the league in minutes played (3,226), minutes per game (39.3), and was third in assists with 642.\\"1979-80 NBA Expanded Leaders\\". – Basketball- Reference.com. Led the league in assists for the 1983–84 season with 914, and regular season games played (82). He missed the 1986–87 season after stepping into a hole during a softball game in New York City's Central Park during the summer of 1986 (July 23, 1986) and suffered severe damage to the tendon just above his left knee. Nixon ruptured his right Achilles tendon during a pre- season practice on November 4, 1987; the injury would cause him to miss the entire 1987–88 season.Zeigler, Mark. – \\"After two career-threatening injuries, the Clippers' Norm Nixon still is planning to ... BOUNCE BACK\\". – San Diego Union. – March 23, 1988. Before being injured he had played in 715 of 725 games available in his first nine seasons. ===Career accomplishments=== During his NBA career, Nixon scored 12,065 points (15.7 points per game) and had 6,386 assists (8.3) in 768 games played. Although he had impressive statistics, he may be remembered most for faking a free throw at the end of a Lakers-San Antonio Spurs game on November 30, 1982, which caused a double lane violation.Swansburg, John. – \\"The NBA dares to trifle with the sports-time continuum\\". – Slate Magazine. The referees erroneously ordered a jump ball, instead of requiring Nixon to re-shoot the free throw. The Lakers got the ball and Nixon made a field goal to tie the game, where they prevailed in overtime. The last three seconds of the game were later replayed in April 1983. == NBA career statistics  Regular season === - style=\\"text- align:left;\\"1977–78 style=\\"text-align:left;\\"L.A.

It stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan as a mother and daughter, respectively, whose bodies are switched by a mysterious and magical Chinese fortune cookie. The film was released in theaters on August 6, 2003, by Walt Disney Pictures and Buena Vista Pictures. It received largely positive reviews from critics, with praise for Curtis and Lohan's performances, and earned over $160 million worldwide on a $26 million budget. The film also earned Curtis a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. It was Disney's third film adaptation of the novel, after the 1976 film, starring Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster, and the 1995 made-for-TV film, starring Shelley Long and Gaby Hoffmann. ==Plot== Anna Coleman is an aspiring teenage musician who lives with her widowed therapist mother, Tess, and younger brother, Harry. Tess is about to marry her fiancé, Ryan, whom Anna has not entirely accepted. At school, Anna's English teacher, Mr. Bates, treats her unfairly, and she is feuding with Stacey, her former best friend-turned-nemesis. Anna has a crush on a school staff member, Jake, of whom her mother disapproves. Anna plays guitar in a band, Pink Slip, which is scheduled to audition for a gig at the House of Blues, the same night as the wedding rehearsal, so Tess forbids Anna from going. At a dinner at Pei- Pei's Chinese restaurant, mother and daughter get into a heated argument. Pei- Pei's mother interrupts their arguing to give them fortune cookies. They both read their fortunes out loud and immediately feel an intense earthquake that the rest of the restaurant is oblivious to. The next morning, Anna and Tess wake up in each other's bodies. \\"Anna\\" (Tess in her daughter's body) has to go to school and begins to understand her daughter's woes. She recognizes Mr. Bates as an old high school classmate, who is picking on Anna because her mother once turned down his prom invitation years ago, and threatens to report him to the school board unless he ceases his unfair treatment. Meanwhile, \\"Tess\\", after giving her new body a makeover, has difficulty handling the patients. At lunchtime, \\"Anna\\" and \\"Tess\\" return to the restaurant but Pei-Pei explains that only showing selfless love for each other will cause the switch to be reversed. \\"Tess\\" attends Harry's parent-teacher conference, where she reads a composition about how much he actually admires her, and decides to be nicer to him. \\"Anna\\" attempts to make amends with Stacey, but Stacey frames her for cheating and “Anna” gets sent to detention. When Jake notices “Anna” sneaking out of detention he offers to help her finish the test. Jake takes “Anna” to the file room in the teachers lounge and she realizes that she misjudged him, but he loses his enamoration towards \\"Anna\\" after she sabotages Stacey's test by erasing most of the answers and writing \\"I'M STUPID!\\" on it. Ryan surprises \\"Tess\\" with a talk show interview to discuss her latest psychology book. To disguise the fact that she hasn't read the book, \\"Tess\\" goes into an amusing tirade about getting older. \\"Anna\\" and Jake watch the interview on television and while she is embarrassed, he is impressed. \\"Tess\\" bumps into Jake at his second job, a coffee shop, and they bond over their favorite music. At the rehearsal dinner, Anna's bandmates try to convince \\"Anna\\" to sneak off to the audition, but they are caught by security. Ryan surprisingly gives \\"Anna\\" permission to go, explaining that he just wants the kids to accept him, and urges \\"Tess\\" to go support the band, finally winning her over. Since \\"Anna\\" cannot play, \\"Tess\\" plays the guitar backstage while \\"Anna\\" only pretends to play. Realizing the fun of her daughter's music, \\"Anna\\" promises to treat her daughter's band with more respect, and during the show, Jake becomes enamored with \\"Anna\\" again upon seeing her perform. Back at the rehearsal dinner, \\"Anna\\" tells \\"Tess\\" to ask Ryan to postpone the wedding, so that her daughter will not have to marry him in her mother's body. Instead, \\"Tess\\" proposes a toast, finally accepting Ryan because of how happy he makes her mom. This act of selfless love switches back Anna and Tess' bodies. Tess and Ryan later marry, she and Anna finally make up, and Anna and Jake start dating with Tess's approval. At the wedding, Pei-Pei notices her mother offering Anna’s Grandfather, Alan, and Harry two fortune cookies after seeing them argue. She immediately rushes and tackles them both, and sighs in relief to have the cookies in her hands. In the credits, Anna is playing with her band at Ryan and Tess wedding. == Cast == Initially, producer Andrew Gunn had hoped that Jodie Foster, who played Annabel in the original 1976 film, would be interested in the role of the mother. Foster declined, citing concerns that her stunt casting would draw attention away from other elements of the movie. Jamie Lee Curtis was offered the role of Tess at the last minute, after Annette Bening dropped out for undisclosed reasons four days before filming began. Kelly Osbourne was originally set to play Maddie, but withdrew when her mother was diagnosed with cancer. She was replaced by Christina Vidal. Marc McClure, who played Annabel's love interest in the 1976 film, makes a brief cameo as Boris the delivery man. The snapshots in the opening credits are photos of Curtis and her daughter, Annie Guest. In the final scene, Dina Lohan, Lindsay Lohan’s mother and manager, makes an appearance as one of the wedding guests. Director Mark Waters also has a cameo holding a baby at the wedding. ==ProductionDevelopment=== Lohan's character was originally written as a Goth, but she did not think anyone would relate to that, and decided to dress in a preppy style for her audition. The character ended up being rewritten as such. Ryan Shuck coached Curtis to play the guitar solo for the concert scene. Lohan trained for one year to learn to play the guitar before production. In the final version of the film, both Curtis and Lohan's guitar parts were overdubbed by professional studio musicians. ===Filming=== Principal photography began on October 5, 2002, and wrapped on December 18, 2002. ==ReleaseBox office=== In its opening weekend, the film grossed $22.2 million in 2,954 theaters, finishing second at the box office, behind S.W.A.T. ($37.1 million). The film went on to gross $110.2 million in North America and $50.6 million in other territories for a total of $160.8 million. The film was released in the United Kingdom on December 19, 2003, and opened at number four. ===Critical response=== Freaky Friday received largely positive reviews from film critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 88%, based on 153 reviews, with an average rating of 6.99/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan charm in Mark Waters' nicely pitched -- and Disney's second -- remake of the 1976 hit.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 70 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F. Curtis's performance was singled out for praise by many critics. David Ansen of Newsweek noted that, \\"the most startling metamorphosis is Curtis' transformation from fading horror flick queen to dazzling comedienne. She goes on a teenage tear—tormenting Anna's younger brother (who wonders why Mom's acting so weird), getting down and dirty on a TV talk show where Tess is supposed to discuss her book on aging—with fiercely funny conviction.\\" Lisa Schwarzbaum from Entertainment Weekly called her performance \\"glorious,\\" and A. O. Scott from The New York Times contended that she \\"does some of her best work ever [in Freaky Friday].\\" Independent reviewer Nick Davis described her as \\"so frisky and pouty and incandescent in Freaky Friday, she made the whole movie feel like something special.\\" Her performance was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Lohan's performance was also praised. Roger Ebert, who gave the film three out of four stars, described Lohan as possessing \\"that Jodie Foster sort of seriousness and intent focus beneath her teenage persona.\\" The film earned her the award for Breakthrough Performance at the 2004 MTV Movie Awards. Nick Schager of Slant Magazine, objected to the body-switching scene, calling it \\"a strange bit of 'Oriental mysticism' stereotyping that seems at odds with the film’s thematic focus on tolerance and understanding.\\" ===Home media=== The film was released on DVD and VHS on December 16, 2003, by Walt Disney Home Entertainment. It was later released on Blu-ray on September 11, 2012. The film is also available on the streaming service Disney+ after its launch on November 12, 2019. ==Soundtrack== The orchestral score was written by Rolfe Kent and orchestrated by Tony Blondal.

Organized crime and corruption were persistent concerns in the city. ==History19th century=== In 1855, Chicago Mayor Levi Boone threw Chicago politics into the national spotlight with some dry proposals that would lead to the Lager Beer Riot by the wets.Richard Carl Lindberg, To Serve and Collect: Chicago Politics and Police Corruption from the Lager Beer Riot to the Summerdale Scandal: 1855–1960 (1991) ch. 1 The 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago nominated home-state candidate Abraham Lincoln. During the 1880s, 1890s, and early 20th century, Chicago also had an underground radical tradition with large and highly organized socialist, communist, anarchist and labor organizations. The Republicans had their own machine operations, typified by the \\"blonde boss\\" William Lorimer, who was unseated by the U.S. Senate in 1912 because of his corrupt election methods.Joel Arthur Tarr, A Study In Boss Politics: William Lorimer of Chicago (1971), ===20th century=== The political environment in Chicago in the 1910s and 1920s let organized crime flourish to the point that many Chicago policemen earned more money from pay-offs than from the city. Before the 1930s, the Democratic Party in Chicago was divided along ethnic lines - the Irish, Polish, Italian, and other groups each controlled politics in their neighborhoods. Under the leadership of Anton Cermak, the party consolidated its ethnic bases into one large organization. With the organization behind, Cermak was able to win election as mayor of Chicago in 1931, an office he held until his assassination in 1933. The modern era of politics was dominated by machine politics in many ways, and the Cook County Democratic Party was honed by Richard J. Daley after his election in 1955. Richard M. Daley, his son, is a former mayor of Chicago and had served for 21 years as mayor and 38 as a public servant. Daley announced on September 7, 2010 that he would not be seeking re-election. Daley was succeeded by former Obama White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. The New Deal of the 1930s and the Great Society of the 1960s gave the Democratic Party access to new funds and programs for housing, slum clearance, urban renewal, and education, through which to dispense patronage and maintain control of the city. Machine politics persisted in Chicago after the decline of similar machines in other large American cities. During much of that time, the city administration found opposition mainly from a liberal \\"independent\\" faction of the Democratic Party. This included African Americans and Latinos. In the Lakeview/Uptown 46th Ward. The first Latino to announce an aldermanic bid against a Daley loyalist was Jose Cha Cha Jimenez, the Young Lords founder. A point of interest is the party leanings of the city. For much of the last century, Chicago has been considered one of the largest Democratic strongholds in the United States. For example, the citizens of Chicago have not elected a Republican mayor since 1927, when William Thompson was voted into office. Brian Doherty was the only Republican council member in recent decades. The police corruption that came to the light from the Summerdale Scandals of 1960, where police officers kept stolen property or sold it and kept the cash, was another black eye on the local political scene of Chicago. Eight officers from the Summerdale police district on Chicago's Northwest Side were accused of operating a large-scale burglary ring. News of the scandal was splashed across the city's newspapers and was the biggest police-related scandal the city had ever seen at the time. Mayor Daley appointed a committee to make recommendations for improvements to the police system. The Daley faction, with financial help from Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., helped elect John F. Kennedy to the office of President of the United States in the 1960 presidential election. The electoral votes from the state of Illinois, with nearly half its population located in Chicago-dominated Cook County, were a factor in the win for Kennedy over Richard Nixon. Chicago politics have also hosted some very publicized campaigns and conventions. The Democratic Party decided on Harry S. Truman as the vice-presidential candidate at the 1944 Democratic National Convention. The 1968 Democratic National Convention was the scene of mass political rallies and discontent, leading to the famous trial of the Chicago Seven. Seven defendants—Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, John Froines, and Lee Weiner—were charged with conspiracy, inciting to riot, and other charges related to protests. Home-town columnist Mike Royko wrote satirically that Chicago's motto (Urbs in Horto or \\"City in a Garden\\") should instead be Ubi est mea, or \\"Where's Mine? The shock election of six Democratic Socialists of America to the council in 2019 was regarded as the largest socialist electoral victory in modern American history. Although technically non-partisan along with the rest of the council, the newly elected aldermen formed a Socialist caucus. == Corruption == Chicago has a long history of political corruption, dating to the incorporation of the city in 1833.Thomas J. Gradel and Dick Simpson, Corrupt Illinois: Patronage, Cronyism, and Criminality (University of Illinois Press, 2015), pp. 11-12, 211. It has been a de facto monolithic entity of the Democratic Party from the mid 20th century onward. Research released by the University of Illinois at Chicago reports that Chicago and Cook County's judicial district recorded 45 public corruption convictions for 2013, and 1642 convictions since 1976, when the Department of Justice began compiling statistics. This prompted many media outlets to declare Chicago the \\"corruption capital of America\\". Gradel and Simpson's Corrupt Illinois (2015) provides the data behind Chicago's corrupt political culture. They found that a tabulation of federal public corruption convictions make Chicago \\"undoubtedly the most corrupt city in our nation\\",Thomas J. Gradel and Dick Simpson, Corrupt Illinois: Patronage, Cronyism, and Criminality (University of Illinois Press, 2015), for the characterization of Chicago, p. xii; for the Table of Federal Public Corruption Convictions,\\" p. 5. with the cost of corruption \\"at least\\" $500 million per year.Thomas J.

The film stars Dan Aykroyd, Howard Hesseman, Lynn Whitfield, Fran Drescher, and Donna Dixon, with a special appearance by James Brown. It is the first film Aykroyd made after the death of John Belushi as well as the first one where he is not sharing the top bill with other actors. Aykroyd and his co-star Dixon married soon after the film's release. ==Plot== Introverted geek Clifford Skridlow (Dan Aykroyd) is a professor of comparative literature at the financially strapped (fictional) Monroe College in Chicago. Smooth Walker (Howard Hesseman), a pimp, owes $80,000 to \\"Mom\\" (Kate Murtagh), a gruff Chicago mob boss. Attempting to weasel out of his debt, Smooth invents a fictitious mobster, the flamboyant \\"Doctor Detroit\\", a ruthless chiropractor who allegedly is overrunning Smooth's turf. Clifford meets Smooth and his girls Monica (Donna Dixon), Jasmine (Lydia Lei), Karen (Fran Drescher), and Thelma (Lynn Whitfield), and has the best night of his life partying with them. The next morning, during a faculty meeting, Clifford learns about their troubles with Mom, that Smooth has skipped town, and that according to Smooth, they are now Clifford's girls. Clifford agrees to assume the persona of Doctor Detroit in an effort to help them out of their jam. Meanwhile, Monroe College anticipates a corporate endowment from Rousehorn Consolidated Industries to be presented by its CEO, Harmon Rousehorn (Andrew Duggan). If the contribution is large enough, it will allow the college to remain open. While Clifford is teaching classes, grading papers, catering a faculty party and assisting in hosting the visiting CEO, his Doctor Detroit alter ego has to find a way to get Thelma out of a solicitation charge, hold Mom at bay, and appear at the Players Ball to be proclaimed the new King of the Pimps while simultaneously appearing at Monroe College's annual Alumni Dinner. When Mom shows up at the Players Ball, she figures out that Doctor Detroit and Professor Skridlow are one and the same, and duels him with sword-length kebab skewers in front of the assembled academics. Following the defeat of Mom, the two functions combine into one joyous, spectacular party, as the ultimate fates of the characters are revealed, ending with the reveal that Clifford married Karen. ==Cast== * Dan Aykroyd as Clifford Skridlow/Doctor Detroit * Howard Hesseman as Smooth Walker * Fran Drescher as Karen Blittstein * Donna Dixon as Monica McNeil * Lydia Lei as Jasmine Wu * T.

Despite this, Doctor Detroit has developed a cult following over the years. ==See also== * List of American films of 1983 ==References* * Category:1983 films Category:1983 comedy films Category:American films Category:American comedy films Category:American independent films Category:Backstreet Records albums Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Lalo Schifrin Category:Films about prostitution in the United States Category:Films directed by Michael Pressman Category:Films set in Chicago Category:Films set in universities and colleges Category:Films shot in Chicago Category:Films with screenplays by Bruce Jay Friedman Category:Films with screenplays by Carl Gottlieb Category:Universal Pictures films ","title":"Doctor Detroit"},{"id":"2236341","text":"Systematic desensitization, also known as graduated exposure therapy, is a type of behavior therapy developed by South African psychiatrist, Joseph Wolpe. It is used in the field of clinical psychology to help many people effectively overcome phobias and other anxiety disorders that are based on classical conditioning, and shares the same elements of both cognitive- behavioral therapy and applied behavior analysis. When used by the behavior analysts, it is based on radical behaviorism, as it incorporates counterconditioning principles, such as meditation (a private behavior/covert conditioning) and breathing (which is a public behavior/overt conditioning). From the cognitive psychology perspective, however, cognitions and feelings trigger motor actions. The process of systematic desensitization occurs in three steps. The first step of systematic desensitization is the identification of an anxiety inducing stimulus hierarchy. The second step is the learning of relaxation or coping techniques. When the individual has been taught these skills, he or she must use them in the third step to react towards and overcome situations in the established hierarchy of fears. The goal of this process is for the individual to learn how to cope with, and overcome the fear in each step of the hierarchy. ==Three steps of desensitization== There are three main steps that Wolpe identified to successfully desensitize an individual. #Establish anxiety stimulus hierarchy. The individual should first identify the items that are causing the anxiety problems. Each item that causes anxiety is given a subjective ranking on the severity of induced anxiety. If the individual is experiencing great anxiety to many different triggers, each item is dealt with separately. For each trigger or stimulus, a list is created to rank the events from least anxiety provoking to most anxiety provoking. #Learn the mechanism response. Relaxation training, such as meditation, is one type of best coping strategies. Wolpe taught his patients relaxation responses because it is not possible to be both relaxed and anxious at the same time. In this method, patients practice tensing and relaxing different parts of the body until the patient reaches a state of serenity.Wolpe, J. (1958). Psychotherapy by reciprocal inhibition. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press. This is necessary because it provides the patient with a means of controlling their fear, rather than letting it increase to intolerable levels. Only a few sessions are needed for a patient to learn appropriate coping mechanisms. Additional coping strategies include anti-anxiety medicine and breathing exercises. Another example of relaxation is cognitive reappraisal of imagined outcomes. The therapist might encourage patients to examine what they imagine happening when exposed to the anxiety- inducing stimulus and then allowing for the client to replace the imagined catastrophic situation with any of the imagined positive outcomes. #Connect stimulus to the incompatible response or coping method by counter conditioning. In this step the client completely relaxes and is then presented with the lowest item that was placed on their hierarchy of severity of anxiety phobias. When the patient has reached a state of serenity again after being presented with the first stimuli, the second stimuli that should present a higher level of anxiety is presented. This will help the patient overcome their phobia. This activity is repeated until all the items of the hierarchy of severity anxiety is completed without inducing any anxiety in the client at all . If at any time during the exercise the coping mechanisms fail or became a failure, or the patient fails to complete the coping mechanism due to the severe anxiety, the exercise is then stopped. When the individual is calm, the last stimuli that is presented without inducing anxiety is presented again and the exercise is then continued depending on the patient outcomesMischel, W., Shoda, Y. & Ayduk, O. Introduction to Personality. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2008. ==Example== A client may approach a therapist due to their great phobia of snakes. This is how the therapist would help the client using the three steps of systematic desensitization: #Establish anxiety stimulus hierarchy. A therapist may begin by asking the patient to identify a fear hierarchy. This fear hierarchy would list the relative unpleasantness of various levels of exposure to a snake. For example, seeing a picture of a snake might elicit a low fear rating, compared to live snakes crawling on the individual—the latter scenario becoming highest on the fear hierarchy. #Learn coping mechanisms or incompatible responses. The therapist would work with the client to learn appropriate coping and relaxation techniques such as meditation and deep muscle relaxation responses. #Connect the stimulus to the incompatible response or coping method. The client would be presented with increasingly unpleasant levels of the feared stimuli, from lowest to highest—while utilizing the deep relaxation techniques (i.e. progressive muscle relaxation) previously learned. The imagined stimuli to help with a phobia of snakes may include: a picture of a snake; a small snake in a nearby room; a snake in full view; touching of the snake, etc. At each step in the imagined progression, the patient is desensitized to the phobia through exposure to the stimulus while in a state of relaxation. As the fear hierarchy is unlearned, anxiety gradually becomes extinguished. ==Specific phobias== Specific phobias are one class of mental disorder often treated via systematic desensitization. When persons experience such phobias (for example fears of heights, dogs, snakes, closed spaces, etc.), they tend to avoid the feared stimuli; this avoidance, in turn, can temporarily reduce anxiety but is not necessarily an adaptive way of coping with it. In this regard, patients' avoidance behaviors can become reinforced – a concept defined by the tenets of operant conditioning. Thus, the goal of systematic desensitization is to overcome avoidance by gradually exposing patients to the phobic stimulus, until that stimulus can be tolerated.Kazdin, A. E., & Wilson, G.T. (1978). Evaluation of behavior therapy: Issues, evidence and research strategies. Cambridge, MA: Ballinger. Wolpe found that systematic desensitization was successful 90% of the time when treating phobias.Wolpe, J. The practice of behavior therapy. New York: Pergamon Press, 1969. ==History== In 1947, Wolpe discovered that the cats of Wits University could overcome their fears through gradual and systematic exposure.Dubord, Greg. \\"Part 12. Systematic desensitization.\\" Canadian Family Physician 57 (2011): 1299+. Print. Wolpe studied Ivan Pavlov's work on artificial neuroses and the research done on elimination of children's fears by Watson and Jones. In 1958, Wolpe did a series of experiments on the artificial induction of neurotic disturbance in cats. He found that gradually deconditioning the neurotic animals was the best way to treat them of their neurotic disturbances. Wolpe deconditioned the neurotic cats through different feeding environments. Wolpe knew that this treatment of feeding would not generalize to humans and he instead substituted relaxation as a treatment to relieve the anxiety symptoms.Rachman, S. Systematic Desensitization. Psychological Bulletin 67:2, 93–103. Wolpe found that if he presented a client with the actual anxiety inducing stimulus, the relaxation techniques did not work. It was difficult to bring all of the objects into his office because not all anxiety inducing stimuli are physical objects, but instead are concepts. Wolpe instead began to have his clients imagine the anxiety inducing stimulus or look at pictures of the anxiety inducing stimulus, much like the process that is done today. ==Recent use== Desensitization is widely known as one of the most effective therapy techniques. In recent decades, systematic desensitization has become less commonly used as a treatment of choice for anxiety disorders. Since 1970 academic research on systematic desensitization has declined, and the current focus has been on other therapies. In addition, the number of clinicians using systematic desensitization has also declined since 1980. Those clinicians that continue to regularly use systematic desensitization were trained before 1986. It is believed that the decrease of systematic desensitization by practicing psychologist is due to the increase in other techniques such as flooding, implosive therapy, and participant modeling.McGlynn, F., Smitherman, T., Gothard, K.. 2004 “Comment on the Status of Systematic Desensitization”. Behavior Modification, 28: 2, pp. 194–205. ==Test anxiety== Between 25 and 40 percent of students experience test anxiety.Cassady, J.C. (2010). Test anxiety: Contemporary theories and implications for learning. In J.C. Cassady (Ed.), Anxiety in schools: The causes, consequences, and solutions for academic anxieties (pp. 7–26). New York, NY: Peter Lang, Children can suffer from low self-esteem and stress induced symptoms as a result of test anxiety.Deffenbacher, J., & Hazaleus, S. (1985). Cognitive, emotional, and physiological components of test anxiety. Cognitive Therapy and Research, 9, 169180. The principles of systematic desensitization can be used by children to help reduce their test anxiety. Children can practice the muscle relaxation techniques by tensing and relaxing different muscle groups. With older children and college students, an explanation of desensitization can help to increase the effectiveness of the process. After these students learn the relaxation techniques, they can create an anxiety inducing hierarchy. For test anxiety these items could include not understanding directions, finishing on time, marking the answers properly, spending too little time on tasks, or underperforming. Teachers, school counselors or school psychologists could instruct children on the methods of systematic desensitization.Austin, J. Sue & Partridge, E.

It was first predicted in a 1990 paper by Klaus Scharnhorst of the Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany. He showed using quantum electrodynamics that the effective refractive index n, at low frequencies, in the space between the plates was less than 1. Barton and Scharnhorst in 1993 claimed that either signal velocity can exceed c or that imaginary part of n is negative. A more recent follow-up paper is ==Explanation== Vacuum fluctuations exist even in a perfect vacuum. The vacuum fluctuations are influenced by conducting plates nearby. As a photon travels through a vacuum its propagation is influenced by these vacuum fluctuations. A prediction made by this assertion is that the speed of a photon will be increased if it travels between two Casimir plates. The ultimate effect would be to increase the apparent speed of that photon. The closer the plates are, the stronger the change in the vacuum fluctuations, and the higher the speed of light. The effect, however, is predicted to be minuscule. A photon traveling between two plates that are 1 micrometer apart would increase the photon's speed by only about one part in 1036. This change in light's speed is too small to be detected with current technology, which prevents the Scharnhorst effect from being tested at this time. ==Causality== The possibility of superluminal photons has caused concern because it might allow for the violation of causality by sending information faster than c. However, several authors (including Scharnhorst) argue that the Scharnhorst effect cannot be used to create causal paradoxes. ==Possible experimentation== It has been hypothesized by an American physicist, Timothy Retter, that the Scharnhorst effect may be demonstrated and detected via an amplifiable acoustical phenomenon. Specifically, an analogous effect to the Scharnhorst effect may be detectable between two sonic black holes. In this region, the speed of sound may surpass the maximum speed possible given the refractive index of the fluid. ==References== Category:Quantum field theory ","title":"Scharnhorst effect"},{"id":"2236441","text":"Edward Canfield Fuller (September 4, 1893 - June 12, 1918) was an officer in the United States Marine Corps and the son of General Ben Hebard Fuller. ==Biography== Born in Hamilton, Virginia, Fuller was a member of the Naval Academy class of 1916, and was commissioned in the Marine Corps upon graduation.

During one trial in 1931, Litten subpoenaed Adolf Hitler, to appear as a witness, where Litten then cross-examined Hitler for three hours. Hitler was so rattled by the experience that, years later, he would not allow Litten's name to be mentioned in his presence. In retaliation, Litten was arrested on the night of the Reichstag fire along with other progressive lawyers and leftists. Litten spent the rest of his life in one German concentration camp or another, enduring torture and many interrogations. After five years and a move to Dachau, where his treatment worsened and he was cut off from all outside communication, he committed suicide. A number of memorials to him exist in Germany, but Litten was largely ignored for decades because his politics did not fit comfortably in either the west or the communist postwar propaganda. Not until 2011 was Litten finally portrayed in the mass media, when the BBC broadcast The Man Who Crossed Hitler, a television film set in Berlin in summer 1931. == Biographical details  The early years === Litten was born the eldest of three sons in a wealthy family in Halle. His parents were Irmgard (née Wüst) and Friedrich Litten (Fritz).Cord Brügmann, Unvergessener Anwalt (PDF) Deutscher Anwaltverein, Deutscher Anwaltverlag (February 1998) pp. 75-81 Fritz was born and raised Jewish, but converted to Lutheranism in order to further his career as a law professor.Book review of Crossing Hitler and interview with author Benjamin Hett Retrieved June 2, 2010 He was a nationalist conservative, and served in the army in World War I, earning the Iron Cross, 1st and 2nd Class. He opposed the postwar Weimar Republic. A distinguished jurist and professor of Roman and civil law, he was dean of Königsberg's law school, later becoming rector of that institution. He was also privy counsel (Geheimer Justizrat) and adviser to the Prussian government. Irmgard was from an established Lutheran family in Swabia, the daughter of Albert Wüst, a professor at the University of Halle-Wittenberg. The family left Halle in 1906 and moved to Königsberg in Prussia. Litten himself was baptized a Christian, but as a youngster learned Hebrew, choosing it as one of the subjects for his Abitur examinations. From his mother, Litten acquired an interest in humanitarian ideas and art, and gained a strong sense of justice for the threatened, persecuted and disenfranchised. While his father was away at war, Litten once took food from the kitchen to give to a beggar, addressing him as \\"sir\\".Irmgard Litten, Eine Mutter kämpft gegen Hitler, Deutscher Anwaltverlag, Bonn (2000) pp. 18, 40, 80-81, 173, 271 Litten's relationship with his father was strained,Gerhard Jungfer, \\"Hans Litten zum 100. Geburtstag\\" (PDF) BRAK-Mitteilungen (2003) pp. 161-163 and his initial interest in Judaism was out of rebellion; he felt his father's conversion was opportunistic. Litten became interested in a German-Jewish youth group with socialist-revolutionary ideas, joining with a school friend, Max Fürst. Nonetheless, at times, he considered himself a Christian. In Dachau he was registered as a Jew, and had to wear the yellow star on his clothing.Documentary on Hans Litten BBC Two, Hans Litten vs Adolf Hitler: To Stop A Tyrant (August 27, 2011). Retrieved September 4, 2011 Litten sought out political debate in his youth. He was shaped by important political and social events of the era, such as World War I, the anti-war demonstration in Berlin on 1 May 1916, when Litten was not quite 13, the German Revolution of 1918–1919, and the arrest and murder of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg by Freikorps soldiers in January 1919. There is an anecdote from Litten's school years, when he was asked in the classroom if they should hang a picture of Paul von Hindenburg, victor of the 1914 Battle of Tannenberg. Litten stated, \\"I've always been in favour of hanging him.\\". Litten was pressed into studying law by his father. He was not interested in it, writing in his journal, \\"When the ox in paradise was bored, he invented jurisprudence.\\"Carlheinz von Brück, Ein Mann, der Hitler in die Enge trieb, Union-Verlag, Berlin (1975) He wanted to study art history,Max Fürst, Gefilte Fisch, Eine Jugend in Königsberg Munich (1973) p. 250 but nonetheless, he approached his law studies in Berlin and Munich with intensity, inspired by the events of the day. The Kapp Putsch, the 1924 court case against Adolf Hitler and other events convinced Litten that Germany was approaching a very dangerous period. His perception that right-wing radicals were receiving more lenient treatment in court than their opponents led to his decision to become a lawyer. Litten passed his examinations in 1927 with excellent grades and was offered a lucrative job in the Reich Ministry of Justice, as well as a good position in a flourishing law firm. He declined both choosing instead to open a law office in 1928 with Dr. Ludwig Barbasch, a friend who was close to the Communist Party. Politically Litten was on the left, though independent. He valued his independence and once said, \\"two people would be one too many for my party.\\" Culturally, Litten was conservative, enjoying classical music and poetry such as that of Rainer Maria Rilke, whose work he could recite. He was an internationalist and was able to read English, Italian, and Sanskrit and enjoyed the music of the Middle East. He had a photographic memory and was considered to have a brilliant intellect. === Cross-examination of Hitler === In May 1931, Litten summoned Adolf Hitler to testify in the Tanzpalast Eden Trial, a court case involving two workers stabbed by four SA men. Litten cross examined Hitler for three hours, finding many points of contradiction and proving that Hitler had exhorted the SA to embark on a systematic campaign of violence against the Nazis' enemies. This was crucial because Hitler was meanwhile trying to pose as a conventional politician to middle class voters and maintained that the Nazi Party was \\"strictly legal\\". Though a judge halted Litten's questioning, thus saving Hitler from further damning exposure, newspapers at the time reported on the trial in detail and Hitler was investigated for perjury that summer. He survived the investigation intact, but was rattled by the experience.Benjamin Carter Hett, \\"Hans Litten and the Politics of Criminal Law in the Weimar Republic\\", in Markus Dirk Dubber and Lindsay Farmer, eds., Modern Histories of Crime and Punishment, Stanford University Press (2007) === The Nazis seize power === By 1932, the Nazi party was in ascendancy. Litten's mother and friends were urging him to leave Germany, but he stayed. He said, \\"The millions of workers can't leave here, so I must stay too\\".Irmgard Litten, Eine Mutter kämpft gegen Hitler, Deutscher Anwaltverlag, Bonn (2000) Hitler's hatred for Litten was not forgotten and in the early hours of 28 February 1933, the night of the Reichstag fire, he was rousted from his bed, arrested and taken into protective custody.Knut Bergbauer, Sabine Fröhlich and Stephanie Schüler-Springorum, Denkmalsfigur. Biographische Annäherung an Hans Litten 1903–1938 pp. 229-230, Wallstein-Verlag, Göttingen (2008) Litten's colleagues Ludwig Barbasch and Professor Felix Halle were also arrested. Litten was first sent – without trial – to Spandau Prison. From there, he was moved from camp to camp, despite efforts by his mother to free him, along with jurists and prominent people from in and outside Germany,Hans Litten Prize Center for Constitutional Rights, official website. Retrieved June 2, 2010 such as Clifford Allen and the \\"European Conference for Rights and Freedom\\", which had members from several countries. Litten was sent to Sonnenburg concentration camp, Brandenburg-Görden Prison, where he was tortured, along with anarchist Erich Mühsam. In February 1934, he was moved to the Moorlager, Esterwegen concentration camp in Emsland and a few months later, he was sent to Lichtenburg. The treatment Litten suffered was later described to his mother by an eyewitness. Very early on, he was beaten so badly that the Nazis refused to let even his fellow prisoners see him. He was tortured and forced into hard labor. He attempted suicide in 1933 in an attempt to avoid endangering his former clients, but he was revived by the Nazis so that they could interrogate him further. Litten's suicide attempt came at Spandau Prison, after he buckled under torture administered to extract information about the Felsenecke trial (see below). After revealing some information, he was immediately accused in the press as an accomplice to the murder of an SA man. Litten then wrote a letter to the Gestapo, saying that evidence gained in such a manner was not true and that he recanted. Knowing what awaited him, he then attempted to take his life. Litten's mother wrote about his ordeal, recounting how injuries sustained by him early on left his health permanently damaged. One eye and one leg were injured, never recovering; his jawbone fractured; inner ear damaged; and many teeth knocked out. She also related how, despite her access to many important people in Germany at that time, including Reichswehrminister Werner von Blomberg, Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, Reichsbischof Ludwig Müller, Minister of Justice Franz Gürtner and even then- State Secretary Roland Freisler, she was unable to secure her son's release.Edith H. Walton, \\"A Man Who Brought Hitler to Court\\" Book review of Beyond Tears by Irmgard Litten. From The New York Times (October 6, 1940). Retrieved June 4, 2010 Despite his injuries and suffering, Litten strove to maintain his spirits. At one point, in 1934, his situation improved a little bit when he was moved to Lichtenburg. Initially, it was the same, with more beatings, but then he was allowed to work in the book bindery and the library. On occasion, he was able to listen to music on the radio on Sundays. He was well liked and respected by his fellow prisoners for his knowledge, inner strength and courage. One prisoner wrote about a party (allowed by the SS) at which a number of SS men were in attendance. Unafraid of their presence, Litten recited the lyrics of a song that had meant a lot to him in his youth, \\"Thoughts are free\\" (in German, Die Gedanken sind frei). The prisoner said that apparently the SS men did not grasp the significance of the words. === Dachau and death === In summer 1937, Litten was sent to Buchenwald concentration camp for a month, before finally being sent to Dachau. He arrived on 16 October 1937 and was put in the Jewish barracks. The Jewish prisoners were isolated from others because Jews in other countries were then spreading the grim news about Dachau. Litten's last letter to his family, written in November 1937, spoke of the situation, adding that the Jewish prisoners were soon to be denied mail privileges until further notice. All letters from Jewish prisoners at Dachau ceased at this time. In the face of their depressing situation, the Jews at Dachau made efforts to have culture and discussion in their lives, to keep their spirits up. Litten would recite Rilke for hours and he impressed the other prisoners with his knowledge on many subjects. Underneath, however, Litten was losing hope. On 5 February 1938, after five years of interrogation and torture and a failed escape attempt, Litten was found by several friends from his barracks, hanging in the lavatory, a suicide.Knut Bergbauer, Sabine Fröhlich and Stephanie Schüler- Springorum, Denkmalsfigur. Biographische Annäherung an Hans Litten 1903–1938 p. 292, Wallstein-Verlag, Göttingen (2008) Retrieved June 9, 2010 The \\"bunker\\", Dachau's prison The day before his suicide, one of Litten's friends, Alfred Dreifuß, found a noose under Litten's pillow. He showed it to the blockälteste, who said it wasn't the first that had been found in Litten's possession. At the time, Litten was under interrogation in the \\"bunker\\" (see photo). When he came back, he was clearly in a suicidal frame of mind, repeating several times that he \\"must speak with Heinz Eschen\\", a prisoner who had just died. He also had recently told his friends that he'd had enough of being imprisoned. Another of Litten's Dachau friends, Alfred Grünebaum, said later that Litten was in constant fear of more brutal interrogations and that Litten had given up on ever being free. On the evening of 4 February 1938, it was clear what Litten had in mind, but no one kept watch. In the middle of the night, his bed was discovered empty and his friends found him hanging in the lavatory. Litten wrote a few parting words and that he had decided to take his life. == Highlights of Litten's legal work == During one of his first trials, Litten caused a sensation, setting the stage for his future as a \\"labor lawyer\\". He represented workers who were sentenced in March 1921 to a long term at hard labor in a Zuchthaus for organized resistance against a police raid of a mass uprising in the central German industrial region a year earlier. The police raid was ordered by the Prussian Minister of the Interior, Carl Severing.Ludger Grevelhörster, \\"Kapp-Putsch und Ruhraufstand 1920\\" Geschichte Westfalens in der Weimarer Republik, Internet Portal – Westphalian History (Internet-Portal \\"Westfälische Geschichte\\") Retrieved June 3, 2010 Litten was able to get some of the workers recognized as political actors, making them eligible under the amnesty law of August 1920. Through his law partner, Barbasch, Litten got involved with the Rote Hilfe, a solidarity organization founded by Wilhelm Pieck and Clara Zetkin that supported worker's families in dire need during the turbulent early years of the Weimar Republic.\\"Rote Hilfe\\" Retrieved June 3, 2010 In addition, the Rote Hilfe arranged legal support and legal defense for workers who were under indictment for their political activities or views. By mid 1929, the Rote Hilfe had helped nearly 16,000 arrested workers with legal defense and supported the legal rights of another 27,000 cases. === 1929: May Day Trial === In 1929, Litten defended participants in the 1929 May Day rally in Berlin, known as Blutmai (\\"Bloody May 1929\\"). Annual workers' rallies on 1 May had been taking place since 1889. In 1929, however, the rally turned bloody when the police intervened with excessive force.. Confrontations between demonstrators and police erupted and the police began firing into crowds and buildings, killing 33 and injuring hundreds, including many bystanders. The workers were charged with severe breach of the peace and with sedition. In preparation for a defense, Litten founded a committee with Alfred Döblin, Heinrich Mann and Carl von Ossietzky to investigate the event. Litten himself had been at the demonstration and observed the brutal actions of the police. When he went to one man's aid and began writing down the names of victims and eyewitnesses, he was himself beaten by a policeman, even though he had identified himself as a lawyer. Litten filed an indictment against the Berlin police president, , for 33 counts of incitement to commit murder. In his legal notice, he stated: Litten's approach was to focus on the legality of the police actions. Rather than pursue individual police officers, he sought to hold the authority, the police chief, to account and he held that Zörgiebel had ordered the police to use truncheons and live ammunition against the demonstrators. If the police action was illegal under the criminal code, the resulting deaths were then murders and anything done by the demonstrators to resist was \\"self-defense in the full legal sense\\". He argued that Zörgiebel had ordered the police invasion for political, rather than policing considerations. As proof, he produced a 2 May 1929 article from the Berliner Tageblatt, where Zörgiebel had written a defense of his actions that showed its political basis. According to Prussian law, police could use \\"necessary measures\\" to maintain public peace and security or prevent a public danger; in other words, it was to be police work and not the result of political conditions. Hans Litten Haus on Littenstraße in Berlin The indictment of Zörgiebel was rejected by the state prosecutors and Litten appealed. Zörgiebel turned around and filed charges against a worker who had slapped his ear. Litten then took on this worker's defense, arguing that the worker had acted out of justifiable anger about Zörgiebel's 33 murders. The justice rejected Litten's request to produce evidence on the grounds that the 33-count murder indictment against Zörgiebel could be accepted as fact without dropping the culpability of the worker who had hit Zörgiebel on the ear. The objective in Litten's many lawsuits for the victims of the police attacks and raids was not to litigate individual incidents, but rather to warn about the growing fascism in the country. He worked to put Nazi terror on display, in the hopes it would awaken the public to the threat facing them. He saw the methods of the police as approaching those of civil war and as being illegal and worked to prove that in court and to pursue the responsible parties wherever they were, even in the highest political circles. He wasn't interested in creating socialist martyrs, rather he sought acquittal or an appropriate punishment, which caused him some conflicts with the Rote Hilfe and the KPD. === 1931: Tanzpalast Eden Trial === On November 22, 1930, an SA Rollkommando attacked a popular dance hall frequented predominantly by left-wing workers. The victims were members of a migrant workers' association that was holding a meeting at the Tanzpalast Eden (\\"Eden Dance Palace\\") in Berlin. Three people were killed and 20 injured in an attack that was planned in advance. The subsequent police investigation was plodding and slow. Litten used four of the injured to represent the plaintiff, seeking to prove three cases of attempted manslaughter, breach of the peace and assault. In addition to pursuing criminal convictions of the offenders, Litten wanted to show that the Nazis intentionally used terror as a tactic to destroy the democratic structures of the Weimar Republic. Hitler was summoned to appear as a witness in court to that end. Shortly before, in September 1930, Hitler had appeared in Leipzig as a witness at the \\"Ulm Reichswehr Trial\\" against two officers charged with conspiracy to commit treason for having had membership in the Nazi Party, at that time, forbidden to Reichswehr personnel.John Wheeler-Bennett, The Nemesis of Power, pp. 218-219. (1967) Macmillan, London Hitler had insisted that his party operated legally, that the phrase \\"National Revolution\\"In Germany, the term \\"National Revolution\\" is not just a reference to the French Révolution nationale, but rather a term that describes the ideology and forces embraced by the Vichy government, the efforts of European right-wing extremists to transform a civil-parliamentarian society into an anti-democratic, nationalist authoritarian one. was to be interpreted only \\"politically\\", and that his Party was a friend, not an enemy of the Reichswehr. Under oath, Hitler had described the SA as an organization of \\"intellectual enlightenment\\" and explained his statement that \\"heads will roll\\" as a comment about \\"intellectual revolution\\".After the Machtergreifung, however, Hitler elaborated further, saying \\"there will be a German State Court and the November 1918 [Revolution] will find atonement and heads will roll\\". The court called Hitler to appear on the witness stand on 8 May 1931. Litten set out to show that the SA Sturm 33 (\\"Storm 33\\") was a rollkommando (a small, mobile paramilitary unit, generally murderous) and that its attack of the Eden and the resulting murders were undertaken with the knowledge of the party leadership. This would mean that the Nazi Party was not, in fact, a legal and democratic organization and would undermine Hitler's efforts to be seen as a serious politician and statesman. Hitler never forgot the Eden trial, and held a personal antipathy towards Litten. Years later, Litten's name still could not be mentioned in Hitler's presence. Roland Freisler quoted Franz Gürtner as saying, \\"No one will be able to do anything for Litten. Hitler turned red with rage from just hearing Litten's name, once bellowing at Crown Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, 'Anyone who advocates for Litten lands in the concentration camp, even you.'\\"  Excerpts from the trial  Litten: (…) Did you know that in the circles of the SA there is talk of a special rollkommando? Hitler: I haven't heard anything about a rollkommando. (…) Litten: You said that there will be no violent acts on the part of the National Socialist Party. Didn't Goebbels create the slogan, \\"one must pound the adversary to a pulp?\\" Hitler: This is to be understood as \\"one must dispatch and destroy opposing organizations\\". (…) (The presiding judge read a question formulated by Litten): Did Hitler, as he named Goebbels \\"Reichsleiter\\" (Leader for the empire) of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, know of the passage from his book, where Goebbels declares that fear of the coup d'état cannot be permitted, that parliament should be blown up and the government hunted to hell and where the call to revolution was made again, letter-spaced? Hitler: I can no longer testify under oath, if I knew Goebbels' book at the time. The theme (…) is absolutely of no account to the Party, as the booklet doesn't bear the Party emblem and is also not officially sanctioned by the Party. (…) Litten: Must it not be measured against Goebbels' example, to awaken the notion in the Party, that the legality scheme is not far away, if you neither reprimanded nor shut out a man like Goebbels, rather straightaway made him head of Reich Propaganda? Hitler: The entire Party stands on legal ground and Goebbels (…) likewise. (…) He is in Berlin and can be called here any time. Litten: Has Herr Goebbels prohibited the further dissemination of his work? Hitler: I don't know. [In the afternoon, Litten returned to this subject.] Litten: Is it correct that Goebbels' revolutionary journal, The Commitment to Illegality [Das Bekenntnis zur Illegalität], has now been taken over by the Party and has reached a circulation of 120,000? (…) I have concluded that the journal is sanctioned by the Party. (…) Presiding judge: Herr Hitler, in point of fact, you testified this morning, that Goebbels' work is not official Party [material]. Hitler: And it isn't, either. A publication is an official Party [organ] when it bears the emblem of the Party. Hitler (shouting, red-faced): How dare you say, Herr Attorney, that is an invitation to illegality? That is a statement without proof! Litten: How is it possible that the Party publishing house takes over a journal that stands in stark contrast to the Party line? Presiding judge: That doesn't have anything to do with this trial. === 1932: Felseneck Trial === The Felseneck Trial was Litten's last major fight against the Nazi Party.Markus Dirk Dubber and Lindsay Farmer, Modern histories of crime and punishment, pp. 183-188. Stanford University Press, Stanford, California (2007) Retrieved June 7, 2010 On trial were five Nazis and 19 residents of the Felseneck arbor colony, where many left-wing workers, including Communists and Social Democrats, were living. In January 1932, there was a brawl involving about 150 storm troopers and colony residents. The troopers surrounded the colony and attacked with stones and firearms. Two people were killed, Ernst Schwartz, a member of the Berlin SA and Fritz Klemke, a Communist; several others, including two police officers, were injured. The resulting trial had numerous defendants and hundreds of witnesses. Litten's meticulousness began to annoy both the presiding judge and the prosecutors, who began to conspire to get Litten removed from the trial. Although there were no legal grounds, the court expelled Hans Litten both as counsel and ancillary counsel for the plaintiff because he had \\"unfurled unrestrained partisan propaganda in the trial\\" and \\"made the courtroom a hotbed of political passions\\". This decision was set aside by the court of appeals, whereupon the presiding judge and an official from the criminal division declared the trial to be biased and the trial was unable to proceed. Shortly after that, Litten was again removed from a high court, having been accused of influencing a witness. This time, the action was sustained by the Kammergericht (Supreme Court) and the court commented further during an investigation of the defense, that the main trial was generally inadmissible. This caused an uproar in the community of Berlin lawyers, including those who were not well-disposed toward Litten. A meeting of Berlin attorneys demanded a change to the law in order to prevent such a curtailment of the fundamental rights of defense attorneys.Tillmann Krach, Jüdische Rechtsanwälte in Preußen, Munich (1991) p. 83 in Cord Brügmann, \\"Unvergessener Anwalt\\", p. 78 Litten was excoriated in the Nazi press as the \\"Red Death Defender\\" and readers were urged to \\"Put a stop to his dirty work\\".Knut Bergbauer, Sabine Fröhlich and Stephanie Schüler-Springorum, Denkmalsfigur.

For the west, Litten had been too involved with communists and for communists, Litten's rejection of Stalinism made him a pariah.Jon Kelly, \\"Hans Litten: The man who annoyed Adolf Hitler\\" BBC News (August 19, 2011). Retrieved September 4, 2011 Memorial for Hans Litten in Berlin-Mitte Bust of Hans Litten at the Berlin District Court When East and West Germany were reunited, the lawyers association of Berlin chose to call itself the Hans Litten Bar Association. Every two years, a lawyer is given the \\"Hans Litten Prize\\" by the German and European Democratic Lawyers Association. The Israeli lawyer, Leah Tsemel, and Michael Ratner, an American lawyer and the president of the Center for Constitutional Rights, have both received the award.Hans-Litten-Preis Description of prize. There is a memorial plaque for Litten located on the former \\"Neue Friedrichstraße\\", renamed in Litten's honor in 1951. The federal and Berlin bar associations (Bundesrechtsanwaltskammer and Rechtsanwaltskammer Berlin) have their headquarters at the Hans Litten Haus, also on Littenstraße (see photo). In 2008, the first in-depth biography of Litten in English was written. Author Benjamin Carter Hett, a historian and former lawyer, came across Litten while working on another book. Commenting on the relevance of Litten's life today and the treatment he suffered while imprisoned, Hett said:In an interview, Hett said he wanted to find out how a country let the rule of law get corrupted. He noted that before the Nazi era, Germany was a law-abiding country with a relatively low crime rate, but that the country was fraught with economic problems and worried governments and there were bitter political divisions. As the crises became more severe, the government changed several times, growing more authoritarian and stripping away the rights of Germans. In 2011 Litten's story was filmed by the BBC. The Man Who Crossed Hitler was written by Mark Hayhurst and directed by Justin Hardy. The role of Hans Litten was played by Ed Stoppard.\\"The Man Who Crossed Hitler – introduction\\" press release BBC (August 9, 2011).
